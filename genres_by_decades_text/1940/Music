Steamboat rounding the bend!
Steamboat rounding the bend!
- The boat's a day early.
- It is that.
I gotta go down to meet it.
My new entertainers are on the boat.
All right, make your bets before the wheel stops rolling.
Make your bet.
Chief!
Sam, put a couple of cases of champagne on the ice.
Right!
Chief, chief!
Where's my daughter, Lettie?
- Him backstage.
- Get me my hat and coat.
The boat's coming in, folks. It's a day early.
Lettie!
- Lettie!
- Yes, Pop?
Is that music mangler getting familiar?
Take your hands off of my daughter.
- Why, Pop.
- Don't you know that ain't modest?
What a thing to say, and about your own daughter, too.
I'm not talking to you, I don't like you.
Well, come on, the boat's docking, we got to meet the people.
You have to wait. I can't wear this dress.
I have to change.
I can't wait. I'll go by myself.
And you take my advice, keep away from that fella.
- I know a crook when I see one.
- Pop.
I bet he'd steal your shirt.
Well, speaking of shirts, isn't that one of mine?
Yes, I stole it. I borrowed it. Here.
- See what it says there?
- Nope.
Made in Paris.
I tell you, he's a suspicious character.
The boat!
Pardon.
Have I the honor and pleasure of addressing
Miss De Valle and her charming ladies?
And you don't have to tell me that you're my new employer, Honest John Calhoun.
I recognized you at once from your description.
I've heard so many wonderful things about you, Mr. Calhoun.
About how honest you are... how generous and free-handed with money.
Thanks. But I'm not Mr. Calhoun.
My name is Candless.
I am the manager of Honest John Calhoun's Emporium.
The finest establishment in the northwest.
You may call me Pop.
Very well, Pop. That'll do.
Till I can think up something better.
Ladies, this way to the carriages, please.
Ladies, the next carriage is right over here!
Get the champagne ready, boys.
All the champagne.
Come right in, ladies.
Right up to the bar, here we are.
Champagne for everybody.
This is on the house.
Sarsaparilla for me.
To Belle De Valle. The belle of the Yukon!
- Very fine vintage.
- Nothing but the best.
My sentiments exactly.
- I so admire a man who doesn't drink.
- I never touch it.
Anything I can do for you, Mr. Candless?
Mervin, you're just in time.
Ladies, ladies!
This is Mervin, the town marshal.
- Hello, Mervin.
- Hello, girls! Glad to meet you.
Mervin, our new star, Miss De Valle.
Chief, show the ladies to their rooms.
And Miss De Valle, if there's anything that I can do, command me.
Well, thank you.
Isn't he cute?
Howdy, brother. I'm looking for Mr. Calhoun.
Mr. Calhoun is up-country.
He's looking at a mining claim.
- He'll be back tonight.
- Thank you.
Sam Slade's my name.
Haven't I seen you someplace before?
No. Clear case of mistaken identity.
Bartender, would love to have some of your best jug whiskey.
- What do you want to see Mr. Calhoun for?
- Why, I'm looking for a job.
I'm the town marshal. What's your game?
Game? Well, I'm a peace officer by trade, but I see that job's filled.
Peace officer? You don't look tough enough to hold down a job like that.
I ain't tough.
I just keep other people from getting tough.
- Pretty fast with a gun, huh?
- I don't like guns.
- So you use a knife?
- No, I don't like knives either.
I had a cousin, Walter, that cut his thumb plumb off just whittling.
That learned me about knives.
No, I just use reason.
You know, talk to people.
That wouldn't work around here.
Brother, be careful with that knife, this suit cost $14.
Just how would you go about talking yourself out of a fix like this?
Well, I don't know offhand.
Kind of reminds me of my Uncle Gus.
Used to be Sheriff of Bedville.
Uncle Gus only had one hand.
So, of course, a fella with just one hand couldn't use a gun or a knife.
Why not? He has the other hand.
Yeah, but naturally in the other hand he had a jug, like that.
Fella's got to have him a jug.
You can see for yourself, he couldn't use a gun or a knife with a jug in one hand... the other hand all...
Drink, friend?
I take great pride and pleasure... in presenting the Nightingale of the North, my daughter, Lettie!
"Every girl is different. Either she's a beauty
"Or she's brainy
"Or the kind you call on when it's rainy
"Every girl is different
"One prefers a baker, one a barber"
"I prefer a man in every harbor"
For a moment I thought the fleet was in.
"Every girl is different
"Some would like a salesman,
Some a watchman"
"I like roaming in the gloaming with a Scotchman"
Don't forget those bagpipes, dearie.
"Oh, look at the Duchess with a snooty air about her
"Her father used to run a livery stable
"When she went to school she wore a dunce cap
"She learned her lesson, and now she's wearing sable
"Every girl is different
"Either she's a tomboy, or she's fragile"
I swoon.
"Or perhaps she's discouragingly agile
"But isn't it a shame
"That men
"Are all the same
"You should learn to dance"
"When you twirl around it's such a grand sensation"
"That's for old maid aunts
"I know better ways to keep in circulation
"Every girl is different."
- "What are you?"
- "The slow type?"
"Or the fast type?"
"No, I think that I'm the made-to-last type
"Now I hope my lecture made you see the light
"But if you have the slightest doubt in the facts I've pointed out
"Why don't you browse around my library some night?"
Hey, chief, what goes on?
Boat come in day early.
- Hi, Mr. Calhoun.
- Hello, George.
- Place is going great guns, eh?
- Looks that way.
You know, you could double your take in here, Calhoun.
Yeah, by letting you put crooked dice and roulette wheels in here... and filling the place with your bunko men.
- That is blunt, but true.
- True?
But nothing to worry about as long as we're behind you.
My answer's still the same: No.
You can carry this honesty thing too far.
Yeah, but that's just a difference of viewpoints, George.
Now, you take the short view, that is, make all you can while you can.
I take the long view.
Establish a reputation for honesty... and do business with the same people all through your life.
- But suppose that...
- Put that back.
- So long, Mr. Calhoun.
- So long.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Pop.
Who is that tall man standing over there?
- The one in the brown coat?
- Yes.
That's our boss, John Calhoun.
Honest John, eh?
Would you tell Mr. Calhoun
I'd like to see him in my dressing room?
- Say, Pop. How'd the show go?
- Great, great.
Miss De Valle would like to see you in her dressing room.
Miss De Valle? Oh, the new star.
Keep her happy.
- Miss De Valle.
- Come in.
Why, if it isn't our old friend, Mr. Jack.
- Viola.
- How are you?
We haven't seen you since you ditched us in Seattle.
We've talked about you a lot though.
And did my ears burn.
After you left, a jeweler came and took back that bracelet that you gave Honey... he said you didn't pay for it.
My goodness was there a to-do!
- Beer.
- Of course.
Why, that's the bracelet, isn't it?
The jeweler must have relented.
A very kind gentleman from Sioux City helped me out of my difficulties.
An elegant gentleman. A banker.
He didn't have much hair and he creaked a bit when he walked... but he certainly was a gentleman.
- Viola!
- All right, I'm going, I'm going.
You look great.
Belle De Valle. I like your new name.
I assure you, I didn't change it for the same reason as you changed yours.
What's your game up here?
I've got the greatest proposition in the world. I've turned honest.
And I'm sweet 16 and never been kissed.
It's on the level.
I figured
I ought to make something out of myself.
Amount to something in the world.
Come back and offer you my name and fortune.
You were thinking only of me?
But you don't have to believe me unless you want to.
I don't believe you.
You're just worried that I'll send word to the Seattle Police.
Telling them the whereabouts of one Gentleman Jack.
Now you wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?
Oh, no? First time you misbehave.
Now, skidoo. I have to change.
You can join me for supper.
- With wine.
- With wine.
And get this straight. No more playing around with that little red-headed singer.
You've got that all wrong.
We're just friends, we're just...
- Is platonic the word you're looking for?
- Yeah, platonic.
When you turn platonic, wolves will be vegetarians.
I'll be ready in a few minutes so you stay on tap.
And remember, don't get any ideas.
From now on, you fetch and carry when I whistle.
I don't know why you insist on hanging on to me.
You always did all right without me.
Sure I did all right without you.
But with you it's more fun.
Say, I'll tell you a nice number.
You know McGee?
- McGee who?
- Well, it's a song. Listen.
You know,
When You And I Was Young, McGee.
- Yeah, I know it.
- You know it?
- Let's go. You ready?
- Ready.
Thank you.
- I'm Calhoun, you want to see me?
- Yes, sir.
Come over to the office.
Pop Candless, shake hands with Sam Slade.
He's working here.
How are you?
Now I remember you.
We worked together on Winslow's Carnival.
You had the roll down and count.
And you were the short change artist.
- Well! Remember Chili Carthy?
- The sheriff with the long coat?
- Pop, see that everything outside is all right.
- Sure.
Sam, it's good to see you.
What took you so long?
Missed the boat.
I've come to take you home.
Wait just a minute, will you?
I want you to hear this.
All right.
My, that's lovely.
- Why don't you try it?
- All right.
Lately I find myself out gazing
at stars
Hearing guitars
Like someone in love
Sometimes the things I do astound me
Mostly whenever you're around me
Lately I seem to walk
as though I had wings
Bump into things
Like someone in love
Each time I look at you
I'm limp as a glove
And feeling
like someone in love
"Like someone in love."
Hey, Pop!
Me rob piano player's room.
Don't say rob, this is an investigation.
All right, me investigate room. Steal him.
The cur!
Get me a pencil and paper.
You're going to travel, you're going to Nome.
More sarsaparilla.
"Seattle Police, Seattle.
"Steve Atterbury is here.
"Come and get him."
Will you tell Mr. Calhoun that supper is served?
You know, this reminds me of when I was young and gay.
Cold bottle and a hot bird, and love.
- Isn't it grand?
- It is, but often it's only indigestion. Go on.
John, listen!
I thought I told you to stay off that stuff!
What's a man going to do when he finds out that his only daughter... has fallen in love with an international crook. A bigamist!
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about Steve Atterbury, the crook.
Our piano player? He's harmless.
Listen.
"Dearest Steve, I hope this letter will reach you...
"and that you will decide to come home and face the music.
"Sherry.
"P.S. The children miss you very much."
The heartless brute.
When I think of those poor little children a-weeping and a-wailing.
With no father to bounce them on his knee... and wipe their little noses.
So Steve's on the run, eh?
I'll find him and tell him he'd better get out of town.
No need to do that.
I've already put a spoke in that villain's wheel.
I sent a runner to Nome with a wireless to the Seattle Police... to come up and get that dirty crook.
Why, you whiskey-soaked idiot!
Didn't you realize if the Seattle cops ever light here... we'll all have to take it on the run?
I think I'll drift on a few hundred miles.
I forgot you're wanted in Seattle.
Forgot.
Hello, Viola. I'm busy.
Miss De Valle says supper's ready and she's waiting.
Tell her I'll be along in a minute.
And remember,
Miss De Valle doesn't like waiting.
What are we gonna do?
I'll send another runner with a wireless to the Seattle Police... telling them their man is in Nome.
- Come on.
- Where we going now?
To see that Steve gets on that boat to Nome tonight.
Good!
You better go sleep it off.
That peak must be 15,000 feet high, and it's perpetually covered with snow.
- It's one of the highest in North America.
- No.
- No what?
- No lectures, no statistics, that's what.
Not tonight anyway.
Every time we're alone together, you find something else to talk about besides...
Well, besides...
Well?
Well, it just seems a shame to waste all that moonlight.
Wonderful moon.
Lettie, you know how I feel about you.
I don't have to tell you.
Maybe that's how people know when they're in love.
Words aren't necessary.
And I know you're in love with me.
You're very conceited. But absolutely right.
It's like this.
I haven't any right to take you in my arms.
I got in some trouble back home and until that's straightened out, well...
I just haven't any right.
You see that, don't you?
Because when a fella kisses a girl like you he's gotta say, "I love you..." and, "Let's get married in a hurry."
Well, I can't say that.
So you see how it is, I just can't kiss you.
I see.
But I do love you.
And if I had the right, I'd take you in my arms and I'd tell you I love you.
Do you understand?
I understand it'd be very improper for you... to kiss me under the circumstances.
- Now, I better walk home with you.
- All right.
Well, I really have to go in now.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I better not kiss you goodbye, someone might be looking.
- Besides, you're not supposed to.
- That's right.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Cast off all lines, sir!
Here you are.
What do you want me to do, drown him?
No, just untie him when you get down the river a ways.
Take it easy, friend. You got lots of time.
- He's on his way.
- Good.
You got some change coming.
Only gave him $100.
Stand by, sir.
Them bells sure do sound pretty.
Always did like the sound of bells.
I remember one time...
Belle. I forget all about her.
Steve's new tune. Isn't it lovely?
You're just a little bit stuck on that fella, aren't you kid?
Nope. I'm not a little bit stuck on him.
I'm madly in love with him.
And I'm gonna marry him and have 13 children all in steps like this.
Boat's leaving, Pop.
Yeah, I know.
Steve's on it.
I know it's tough, kid.
Don't you think you better go up and get some sleep?
Good night.
John! Steve's on that boat.
I know.
Lettie, he's not worth crying over.
I'm not crying 'cause I want to.
Come on, come on. Keep your chin up.
- Honey, it's me.
- Come in.
That's the trail there.
Malemute's just a little ways ahead.
All right, thanks.
Next time you take a swim, don't forget to take your clothes off.
Come on, boy.
Better hurry, Lettie.
You're on in a few minutes.
I'm hurrying.
Tears are tough on the mascara, aren't they?
Here, let me help.
Is this the first time you've had your heart broken?
You're not gonna tell me it can happen more than once.
The heart is like one of those old Chinese vases.
It can have enough cracks in it to look like a spider web... but it'll still hold together.
What's the cure, if there is one?
Time.
Diamond bracelet helps speed things up.
A new hat.
The best thing's to get mad.
Break something.
Over the guy's head if possible.
- Lettie.
- Steve.
- I've got to talk to you.
- About what?
About that mess in Seattle.
- Is it true?
- Well, of course it's true, but I can explain it.
See, Lettie, after last night I didn't want you to think that there was any...
Look, I'm late for my number and there's no need of explaining.
When a fella and a girl with nothing much to do go for a walk in the moonlight... it almost always has to end up in that type of conversation.
Just as it almost always has to end up in a kiss.
Don't worry.
I'm late. Goodbye.
If I were the type to play around
it wouldn't be so bad
But I didn't know my way around
and what a time I had
I was taken for
a sleigh ride in July
Oh, I must have been a set up
for a sigh
A mockingbird was whistling
a sentimental tune
and I didn't know enough to come in
out of the moonlight
So the big romance
was only make believe
Just a sleigh ride
on a balmy summer eve
My dreams were safe all winter
and then to think that I
was taken for
a sleigh ride in July
Stop crying and get mad.
I can't get mad. I just want to bawl.
Just remember. A woman is always at her worst when she's bawling.
Or at least will be until they invent a powder and rouge that won't melt.
I guess I've been made an awful fool of.
Sucker is the word. Now get out there.
I was taken for
a sleigh ride in July
Oh, I must have been a set up

a sentimental tune
and I didn't know enough

Mervin, you know Steve, my piano player.
- Yeah, I hear he left town.
- Well, he's back.
He's been tapping my cash register.
There he is.
I hope you don't want him arrested.
It ain't that I'm kindhearted, Mr. Calhoun.
But it's too much trouble sweeping out the jail and bringing him his meals.
- I'll just run him out of town.
- No, he had that chance.
Now lock him up, and I'll tell you what to do with him later.
- Coming peaceable?
- No!
You didn't know when you was well-off.
I reckon you just want to see the inside of my jail.
- Morning, boss. Morning, Miss De Valle.
- Morning, Sam.
Say, you're pretty near out of dog, ain't you?
He's a cute little fella. Let me.
Come here, come here.
Say, he makes war talk, though.
I took care of that little matter, boss.
It'll be done this morning.
- Good.
- Here. You carry him, will you?
Belle, don't you think I look kind of silly carrying him?
Don't be foolish. You look very domestic.
I like you this way.
I always said if you devoted half the time to work... that you do to thinking up those confidence games... you'd be a very successful business man.
Hey, Mr. Calhoun! You look mighty silly.
Big man like you carrying a little dog like that.
- Prof. Salisbury.
- Yes?
I don't think you remember me, sir.
I ran a pack train for you when you made your survey in South America.
Yes, of course.
- This is Miss De Valle, Professor.
- Miss De Valle.
The Professor's the world's greatest authority on the weather.
- Come now.
- Yes, it's true.
He made the North Atlantic surveys... which have saved the lives of thousands of fishermen.
Really?
You're the first professor I ever saw.
I always thought they wore plug hats.
This is the town marshal, Professor.
Just the man I wanted to see.
I have here the data from the United States Government Bureau... on my two-year study of Alaskan weather conditions.
I'd like to deposit them in a safe place until I can leave for the States.
Why not put them in the safe in my place?
Marshal, take the Professor down to the Emporium.
Sure.
- Thank you very much. See you later, I trust.
- Certainly.
Right this way, Professor.
This is it. Come in for a moment.
This isn't San Francisco.
There's nothing you'd want in here.
A corset string is a corset string and I just broke mine.
- Be there in just a minute, Mr. Calhoun.
- No hurry.
The latest thing in straws.
Look, the only guy who would wear this would be a grade B idiot... on his way to the fireman's picnic.
- Anything I can do for you?
- Yes, a corset string, please.
We might have one in the stock room.
I'll take a look.
Yeah.
This is the hat.
- Nix, nix.
- This is a dream!
I like that fellow. He appeals to me.
Business man. Money in the bank, good reputation around town.
- Certainly.
- Takes up the collection in church.
- They can trust him with it.
- Of course.
- I like him.
- His wife probably has to help the maid.
I still like him.
I wouldn't mind helping the maid.
You'd be out of character.
You're the type that needs waiting on.
Just lately. I used to be the type that came from a family of nine.
I did the cooking, sewing, while my younger brothers and sisters were growing up.
But you were glad to get away from all that.
No, I don't think you'd like this kind of fellow.
Keep it.
I'd rather you were wearing it when I say this.
And if you laugh, I'll run a hat pin right through your vest pocket.
Let's get married.
Well, I'm not sure I like your being quite so surprised.
- Well, it's so sudden.
- I'm supposed to say that.
I never thought that you...
Of course not. Not when you're one jump ahead of the police at all times.
But you've changed. Now you even insist on taking a morning walk.
You've never got out of bed before noon unless the mattress caught on fire.
- You're different in a lot of ways.
- Am I?
We might find this all very boring.
I wouldn't. I promise.
Jack, this is all on the level, isn't it?
Of course it's on the level.
I'm as honest as the day is long.
That's wonderful. I haven't been so happy since the night you gave me the bracelet.
I wouldn't want another disappointment like that.
No, of course not. Everything's set.
And so, gentlemen, when the reports are published... you people of Alaska will no longer be at the mercy of the elements.
You will know when to expect changes in temperature.
No longer will the intrepid traveler of the northern wastes... be caught out on a trail by sudden cold spells and left to die.
You mean that you'll be able to tell when the freeze-up's coming in advance?
Unfortunately, we of the Government Weather Bureau... have not yet reduced our prognostications to an exact science.
We are occasionally in error.
Our predictions have sometimes missed by as much as 12 hours.
That'll be great. You know, if we can know within a day... when a freeze-up's coming, that'll sure save a lot of lives.
- This is yours if you open that.
- What for?
- I want a look at the Professor's report.
- I couldn't do that.
- See you later, Mervin.
- Thanks for the drink.
Hello, Mervin.
If a big fella had you in a fix like this what would you do?
How'd you talk your way out?
Mervin, the fix you got me in now reminds me a whole lot... of a fella I used to know down home.
Fella by the name of Hod Durning.
He was a great big fella like you...
- and he was cross-eyed, just like you.
- But I ain't cross-eyed.
I don't mean cross-eyed exactly,
I mean he had a cast in his eye like you.
I haven't got a cast in my eye, look.
Well, you're right, Mervin.
You ain't got no cast in your eye.
All right. Talk yourself out of this.
Hey, I'm on fire, I'm on fire!
I'm on fire, I tell you, put me out!
This your gun? Drink, friend?
- Mr. Calhoun.
- Hello, George.
What are you gonna do, a little gambling?
You wouldn't really call it gambling.
You mind if I use one of your tables?
- No, help yourself.
- Thanks.
Boys, let Mr. Maitland use this table.
- Game's closed, men, cash your checks.
- Thank you, boys, thank you very much.
Like to do a little gambling on the freeze-up date, boys?
Little too early for that.
We don't usually start until late in the fall.
What's your idea on the freeze-up date?
I got 3,000 ounces of dust, two to one that says the river freezes up... by September 15.
You're crazy. She ain't never froze before October 1.
Just put your money where your mouth is,
I say September 15.
I'll take 30 ounces of that.
- You got a bet. Get his name, Frank.
- Spike Roberts.
- When did you say the freeze-up was?
- September 15.
- I'll take 20 ounces of that. McClusky.
- I'll take 40 ounces. Tambrook.
- What did you say the odds were?
- Two to one.
Give me 10 ounces, Mills. 10 ounces.
- They fell?
- With a bang.
Avarice, avarice.
Man's greed always leads him to his downfall.
Your smart friends will undoubtedly be making some substantial bets... on the freeze-up date.
Are your men covering as much of the money as possible?
Not a cent. I don't believe in gambling of any type.
Well, I don't see how you stand to make a profit.
I do.
I wouldn't stay around here if I were you.
Leave while the suckers are happy.
An old rule of mine.
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
Anybody else think I'm crazy?
- We're all cleaned out.
- Who's gonna hold the stakes?
That's a lot of dust.
4,500 ounces of temptation.
Well, the Marshal here can keep it at the jail and watch it.
- Well, who's gonna watch the Marshal?
- You questioning my character?
Folks. Why not let Mr. Calhoun here hold it?
He may not be the only honest man in town, but he's the only one I know.
No, I don't want to hold the stakes.
But gentlemen... what's happened here tonight proves one thing we need in Malemute.
And that's a bank. I suggest a committee of citizens get together... and select some reputable member of the community to start one.
Now, the man selected should be sober... industrious, honest, and of good integrity.
- Nice billing.
- It was forced on me.
Good morning, Mr. Calhoun.
- I want to open a savings account.
- Yes, ma'am.
Why, Viola!
I thought it'd be safer here than in a mattress.
- What name, please?
- Viola Chase.
- A checking or savings account?
- Savings account, please.
- Be ready in just a minute, Mr. Calhoun.
- All right.
- What is that?
- It was a boiler, now a vault.
- There you are, sir.
- Thanks, Smitty.
Take a ton of dynamite to blow that baby.
My happiness is tinged with a certain amusement.
Doesn't it seem odd that you should be custodian of other people's money?
That's like setting a tiger to mind a baby.
What's the old saying about a tiger changing his spots?
Leopards have spots.
- Do I have to start acting dignified?
- Why?
A banker's wife has to be dignified.
Did you locate the minister yet?
No. Not yet.
Sent runners up and down the river but they haven't found him.
Alby will be here in a couple of weeks on his regular circuit.
A couple of weeks? I can hardly wait.
Not that I'm impatient or anything but... a Madam Lucille once told me that there's one thing a girl can't be too quick about.
- You're happy about this, aren't you?
- Sure.
I've never had much faith in banks but I happen to know the president of this one.
- I'd like to open an account.
- I shall be delighted, Miss De Valle.
- A checking or savings account?
- Both.
Mr. Calhoun.
- May we have your signature, please?
- Certainly.
- Mr. Calhoun, I got a problem.
- Yeah, what is it?
That piano player's ruining my whole life.
I spend all of my time waiting on him.
Do you think he's grateful?
Nothing suits him.
- He's always batting me.
- I tell you what you do.
Tonight, take him to Nome.
They got a good jail there.
Leave him and send a wire to the
Seattle Police saying they can pick him up.
That's the smartest thing I ever heard of.
On top of which, I got a girl in Nome who'll be mighty glad to see me. I hope.
- Thank you, Mr. Calhoun, thank you.
- Think nothing of it, Marshal.
If you ever run short, don't go to strangers.
You and me's going for a little ride.
I won't put these on you if you promise not to bat me. Promise?
I told you and told you to quit batting me in the jaw.
First thing you know, you're gonna make me mad.
Get up.
Marshal. There you are.
- Officer, do your duty.
- Go away!
- Arrest me. I know my constitutional rights.
- Go away!
- Arrest me. I got $700.
- Get off me, you big moron.
I got $700 and the jail is the only place in this town...
- Will you get out of here?
...where a man with $700 is safe!
- Arrest me...
- Get off.
...or you'll be derelicting your duties!
Go away, will you, you bore me.
Mervin, look at me.
See how mad that'll make you.
The key, where is it?
- Was it a big key, or just a little one?
- The handcuffs.
Let's look out there. More light.
- Prof. Salisbury.
- How do you do?
I ask you, sir, is this right?
I have been arrested in every state in the Union. And in several territories.
Once in south Memphis,
I was forced to build roads...
- and again in Chattanooga I had...
- Get up.
- But the key, George!
- Shut up!
So you've been in a lot of jails.
Well, you and I are gonna have a little talk.
Well.
The bank's been robbed!
Wait for me!
- I want all the dust you got in that boiler.
- Well, of all the...
Now, look here, you!
- How'd you tumble?
- Your professor got drunk and talked.
That was a pretty plan. When did you figure to grab the dust and run?
About the day after tomorrow.
Open it up. I'll do the running.
Honest John Calhoun.
You almost had me fooled.
All right, everybody sit down.
Very pretty.
All right, Mervin, start taking it out.
- Ever been to a lynching, George?
- No.
You will.
You'll be playing a most important part.
You can't get away. Those miners will run you down even if you have a two-day start.
- How were you gonna get away?
- On the Alaskan Star.
She arrives Wednesday and leaves Thursday... but I see I can't operate without you and you can't operate without me.
Why don't we just take this dust and quit all the jabbering.
You're a smooth character, Calhoun.
Looks like there's gonna be quite a party of us leave Thursday night... on the Alaskan Star. Partners?
Nothing like company to make a pleasant voyage.
That's right. But either Mervin or me will be dropping in to the Emporium... every couple of hours.
And if any one of the four of you are missing, it's gonna be rough.
I'll start yelling and there'll be a posse of miners on every trail.
- Until Thursday.
- Come on, Mervin, bring the empties.
- But George, I don't understand...
- Come on.
Looks as though you gentlemen are going to have to split more ways than you figured.
Give me a hand, boys.
Right pretty, huh?
It's pretty all right but it ain't gold.
- Where I come from we call it sand.
- Are you sure?
I got fooled with this once before.
I come pretty near marrying a homely widow with 40 acres of this stuff.
I knew those mugs would never get the best of us.
Come on, Sam.
Of course, you always intended showing your partners the real plan.
You don't think
I'd double-cross my partners, do you?
Not to give you a short answer, yes.
I suppose this is an unpleasant surprise.
I remember the old saying:
"The tiger cannot change his stripes nor the leopard his spots."
Well, what are you going to do?
I'd give a substantial reward for the answer to that question.
I wouldn't walk across the street with you.
You're acting a whole lot different from the girl I used to know.
That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
And as far as I'm concerned it can be the last.
Now, Mama always said, "Many a honest heart is concealed behind a simple face."
Well, your face is concealing something.
Marshal.
Too bad your prisoner got away,
I understand he outsmarted you.
Nobody better start picking on me.
I've had a very trying day and my nerves is all on edge.
I ain't picking on you, Marshal.
Just reminded me of a fella we had down home one time.
He let his prisoner get away from him and at the next election...
Talk your way out of this if you're such a much.
Well, I don't know just what to do.
Looks like you got me this time.
But you know, I just happened to think of what my Aunt Puny used to say.
She was my sickly aunt.
And when she got in a spot where she didn't know what to do... she'd just faint. Like this.
Here you are, Mervin.
Now, Aunt Puny used to say that in case of a nose bleed... put something cold to the back of the neck and it'll stop it.
This your gun?
Drink, friend?
Mervin, you and Sam look around town and pick up Steve.
He's as good as here.
Girls, I heard Pop sound curfew a half hour ago.
- Good night, Mr. Calhoun.
- Good night.
- Any luck?
- No.
Looked all over town for that young fella.
Can't find him no place.
- Are you the town marshal?
- I'm him.
The Alaskan Star hailed me coming up the river...
- and the Captain asked me to give you this.
- Thanks.
- What does it say?
- Official business.
You know you can't read.
I was gonna get somebody to read it for me later.
- You don't have to tell everybody.
- "To the Peace Officer of Malemute.
"Please hold for our arrival one Steven Atterbury."
We gotta find that fella tonight if we have to run this town through a sieve.
- Why tonight?
- So that Mervin can hand him to the cops... before they get off the boat.
If them cops start snooping around this town too much... some of us are gonna be very unhappy.
Come on.
Mervin. Throw that drunken Indian out.
Funny thing.
Never saw a blond Indian before.
Here he is!
Open up!
I'll give $1,000 to the man who gets him.
He went that way.
- What do you want?
- Nothing.
- Who are you?
- Nobody.
- Who's that?
- It's me, Steve.
- Steve!
- Lettie, I have to talk to you.
Say, you must have a pretty broad-minded wife... to let you come charging into girls's bedrooms this way.
Yeah, but they're chasing me.
And the police from Seattle are gonna be here in the morning.
- You've gotta listen to me.
- Don't try to lie out of it, Steve.
I know you got a wife and children in Seattle.
You're out of your mind!
What's all this nonsense?
Somebody tells you an idiotic lie about me and you believe them.
- That's love, I say...
- Come out of there with your hands up!
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.
Excuse me, Miss Lettie.
I thought I heard a man talking.
You mean talking like this?
I sometimes do that in my sleep.
You know, I could have sworn
I heard a man talking in here.
Well, you can see there's no one here.
I can see now.
- Steve.
- No kids, no wife. Believe me.
I do.
I believe you, I do!
Woman, you're hindering the law.
Well, there goes my $1,000.
I've got him!
I tried to give you a chance, young fella.
Too bad you didn't have sense enough to take advantage of it.
When do I get the $1000?
When you hand him to the police on the Alaskan Star in the morning.
And see that you don't lose him between now and then.
You want me to help you watch him, Marshal?
No!
Help watch him.
Little man... you're worth 1,000 of Mr. Calhoun's dollars dead... just the same as alive.
So try anything you like.
Yes?
Good morning, Mr. Calhoun.
Sit right down. There's an extra cup and the coffee's piping hot.
I always say that coffee should be clear as crystal...
- hot as the devil...
- And black as a thief's heart.
- Good morning.
- Is it?
- Some coffee?
- No coffee.
It'll do you good.
Lay out those dresses, Viola.
No coffee.
Mr. Calhoun, I know at heart you're just a diamond in the rough... but your barking doesn't frighten me a bit.
Diamonds don't bark. Pack those dresses.
So that's your decision.
You're cutting loose from me.
Spurned is the word they use in books.
It'll do.
Have some sense. I've got a tiger by the tail.
It's a choice between my skin and the kid's.
You wouldn't want me to put my neck in a noose, would you?
- Or would you?
- I'm considering.
If you feel that way, all you have to do is speak to the right people... and I'd be wearing a heavy iron bracelet.
- Pack this?
- Yes.
- Well, why don't you tell the police?
- I don't know.
Maybe being in love has something to do with it.
There's a whole epidemic of soft-heartedness around here.
- Don't worry. You're immune.
- I certainly am.
I think you'll change your mind.
And come running back to you?
Maybe a gentleman wouldn't say this, but I'd bet my last dollar that you will.
Well, don't you worry about what a gentleman would say. Now get out.
Are those tears?
The day I cry over a man... will be a day just like this.
Oh, Steve.
Stand by, sir.
Throw the line, sir.
- Let them alone.
- But l...
But you can't go over there. I'm giving them a chance to say goodbye decent.
I'm just a sentimental man at heart, I guess.
Stand by engine, sir.
Don't they make a pretty couple?
Both engines, full astern, sir.
- That's arson, ain't it?
- What?
- Him already having a wife and family.
- It's murder.
- But you can't reason with her.
- All right, stand back folks, gangway.
Gangway.
I'll tell these coppers to treat you nice on the boat.
Thanks.
Steve, darling!
- Sherry!
- I'm so glad you're here!
What a surprise. Lettie, this is Sherry.
My sister.
Your sister?
Well.
- Pop, this is Sherry, his sister.
- Then it was her that wrote the letter.
I didn't even know you had a sister.
He has two others and three younger brothers. The children miss you so much.
- So I heard.
- Sure takes a load off of my mind.
- Thank you, Captain.
- Good luck, chief.
Sir, your prisoner's right there.
Now look here, Officer, we'll fight this case in every law court in the country.
- Hello, Steven.
- Hello, sir.
- Who are these men?
- Mervin, the town marshal... and Mr. Candless. Meet my father.
See, Father, we thought I was going to be arrested for that trouble back home.
No, I paid the company the money your foolishness lost.
I guess it was mostly my fault.
I shouldn't have tried to force you into being a businessman.
Well, Steven, aren't you going to introduce me to the young lady... whose waist your arm is around?
- Sir, this is Lettie Candless.
- How do you do, Lettie?
Don't bother remembering her last name, she's gonna change that right away.
A crowded wharf is hardly the place to get acquainted... with a prospective daughter-in-law.
Well, what are we waiting for?
Come on, let's go!
Did you have a nice trip?
- Have a cigar.
- Thank you.
"Made especially for C. V. Atterbury."
Well, you know, that's a very funny thing... that you should have the same name as C.V. Atterbury... that owns all those railroads and steamships...
- and mines and banks.
- What's funny about that?
- You mean you are the...
- Let me assist you, Mr. Candless.
- No. Let me assist you, Mr. Atterbury.
- Thank you.
All right, make your bets before the wheel stops rolling, men.
Make your bet.
Pick your lucky number.
A toast! I want to propose a toast to Mr. Atterbury, my father-in-law to be.
And to Pop Candless, my father-in-law to be.
If you'll excuse me,
I must change for my number.
- And the name of that number is?
- The Ballad of Milicent Devere.
Ballad of Milicent Devere.
Sounds like something from Robert Service.
Mr. Atterbury, you're in for a surprise.
Viola, will you bring my things?
- I won't be a moment.
- A single moment will seem forever.
Spoken like a true knight of the round table.
Pardon me, Mr. Atterbury. I have to run down to the bank, but I'll be right back.
Pop, Sam. Excuse us, folks.
Imagine not knowing Steve had a sister.
Why there's seven of us children all told.
And father had four brothers and two sisters.
So you can see we've got a very bright future.
Anyhow, a busy one.
Hello, George, I got your message.
What's up?
Just want to talk to you about a few things.
- Double-cross, huh?
- Sort of.
The Alaskan Star sails tonight instead of tomorrow night.
That must have cost you something.
It did. But it'll show a neat profit.
Less people get a cut.
Come on, start moving.
Make a bad move anytime you want, gentlemen.
Miss De Valle. They walked out on us.
- Where do you think they've gone?
- That Mr. Jack, he's so industrious.
- He's gone to the bank.
- What?
I love hard working men, they come in so handy on the first of the month.
What a first class sucker I've been.
To think I believed that fellow.
All right girls, make your changes for the next number.
- Hold everything!
- Hold everything? You can't do that... the show must go on, you know.
- Why?
- I don't know.
To think I've got my own money in that bank.
- Anything wrong with the bank?
- The bank? What about the bank?
- I'm not saying it's unsteady or anything...
- I got money in there.
Your money will be safe. Probably.
"Probably" won't help me buy a chicken farm to retire on.
Kids, wait a minute, kids.
There's nothing to worry about.
If you draw your money out tonight.
What are we waiting for? Come on, let's go.
You can start down to the boat with that stuff.
I'll take care of locking up our ex-partners and catch up with you later.
All right.
But first, there's two things I gotta do.
What would you do if a fella did this to you?
- Well, l...
- That's one of them.
What's the other?
This.
Ain't no use to look on the boat for me.
I don't like boats. They make me seasick.
You thought I was dumb, didn't you?
Stay where you are.
You weren't a bit ruffled when Mervin walked out of here... with that gold dust, were you?
You know, sometimes I'm so smart
I surprise myself.
I knew exactly what Mervin was gonna do.
You were smart enough to sneak back to this window and take a peek.
That's just what I did. Open it up.
All right, everybody get in that closet.
Mervin's gonna be awfully mad when he finds... he's carried all that sand 1,000 miles.
- Looks like this kind of upsets things.
- Yeah, I know.
Just like Papa always said:
"If you lay down with hound dogs, you gonna get up with fleas."
- You kind of had some ideas yourself.
- What do you mean?
I know all about those horses you had staked out between here and Fairbanks.
Well, Grandpa used to tell me if a fella don't look out for himself, nobody else will.
Well, it looks like I'm in with nothing but a bunch of crooks!
- How do you know this here bank ain't safe?
- I'm positive it isn't.
Miss De Valle is Mr. Calhoun's sweetheart and she's worried about her money in there.
That's good enough for me.
I got 400 ounces of dust in there... and if I don't get it, he gets this!
Heap much trouble, Mr. Calhoun.
Many people come, they got ropes.
Hang everybody.
- Chief, go guard the front door.
- All right.
What are we gonna do?
You should have stayed away from here, there's a run on the bank.
- I know, I sent them.
- You sent them?
Of course,
I spread the rumor the bank wasn't safe.
You'd be surprised how quickly people believe a story like that.
Listen to them.
You ought to marry some honest fella and help him get along in the world.
That's not a bad idea.
We haven't got any money to pay off.
Mervin stole the sand because he thought it was gold and George stole the gold.
Suppose you go out there and try to bluff them with conversation.
That's your specialty. But I'll try.
It's been so nice knowing you,
Miss De Valle.
Let's all be quiet, please! Quiet!
Folks, your money is inside and is absolutely safe.
You're the only one that thinks so.
All this trouble has been caused by some malicious rumors.
We don't want any unsatisfied depositors.
Anybody...
Give us our money, we'll be satisfied.
Well, the bank opens at 9:00 in the morning.
- I want my dust right now!
- Wait a minute, wait a minute!
All right. The bank will open in a moment.
Take care of the keys, chief.
Are you crazy?
How are you gonna pay them?
Mama told me if I didn't go to Sunday school I'd wind up at the end of a rope.
We can't all hide in there.
Come on, give me a hand.
- I'm confused.
- Come on, get busy.
Pop, you take that set of scales,
Sam, you take that set.
I'd like to see the expression on George's face... when he opens up them sacks and finds out he's got sand, too.
- All right, chief. Open up, let them in.
- All right.
Quiet, folks. Form a line at each window.
Now don't crowd.
All your gold's safe, you'll get it.
I can see that I've always underestimated you.
Resourceful would be a good one-word description of you.
Thank you.
I can think of another word but I won't use it, being a lady.
Cover that.
- Here's some greenbacks.
- Calhoun.
- Atterbury wants to see you.
- Yes?
Hello, Mr. Calhoun.
I'd like to talk to you for a minute.
- Why, certainly. Step right in.
- Thank you.
- Miss De Valle.
- Good evening.
My boy, a situation like this can be disastrous.
So I've heard.
But I have no intention of leaving a man like yourself... in such a predicament.
There's no need to worry.
We're all right, the money's all here.
Mr. Calhoun, I pride myself on one thing:
My judgment of character.
When I first laid eyes on you
I said to myself:
"There's a fine, honest, dependable man."
I hope you're not injured, Miss De Valle.
Although I quite realize all this excitement would cause a lady to faint.
It was the shock. I'm all right now.
I should like, sir, to have you accept these drafts on San Francisco... for deposit in the amount of $100,000.
Mr. Atterbury.
Really, I couldn't, Mr. Atterbury...
I couldn't think...
Step in here, Mr. Atterbury.
Mr. Candless, a passbook, please.
- C.V. Atterbury?
- Correct.
- Shall I use your Seattle address?
- Yes.
C.V. Atterbury just deposited $100,000.
- What?
- What did you say?
- C.V. Atterbury just deposited $100,000.
- He did? C.V. Atterbury?
I saw him with my own eyes.
I don't know where to put this where it's gonna be safe.
I'm gonna put mine back in the bank.
Me, too.
Mr. Atterbury, would you please take off your hat?
Thank you. I've always wanted to see a halo.
You should look in your mirror,
Miss De Valle.
Mr. Atterbury.
I wish you fellas would make up your mind.
One minute you take it out, the next minute you put it in.
All right, next, who's next? Come on.
Please, Mr. Candless, may I have back my book?
I don't want to be robbed in the middle of the night.
Viola Chase.
You know, Viola...
"yes," would make it Mrs. Candless.
I won't say yes. I'll say maybe.
May I?
Now that you want to be a banker's wife, a little less flash.
You know, a little more conservative in public.
- And in private?
- Be your own calm, sweet self.
I know exactly what you mean.
Where's the La Fonda Hotel?
Hotel?
Over where?
Thanks.
You talk English?
Yes.
Where's the La Fonda Hotel?
What's the matter?
Doesn't anybody know?
It's over there by the stores.
Si, way over there.
No, not over there.
What's the name of the street?
What's the matter with you?
What are you looking at?
You, I'm talking to.
Who you looking at?
I show you... the... hotel.
Why don't you look where you're going?
Okay, Sitting Bull, pick up your feet.
Get going, come on.
There is the hotel.
Thanks.
Please...
You take this. put it in your pocket.
Don't lose it.
Her name is Ishtam.
My grandmother gave it to me
When I come to the city, so I not be run over.
No, I'm not buying any souvenirs.
No, no, you on't buy it, you keep it.
It protect you.
From what?
Hello.
No, ma'am, not at all, ma'am.
Positively nothing.
I'm very sorry.
Thank you, ma'am.
If anything turns up,
I have your name.
Room and bath for one, please.
Nothing available, sir absolutely nothing available.
No mail, Mrs. Eustace.
You might try the El Capitan down the street, sir but I know they have nothing either.
My name is Blane.
I reserved rooms for four with bath.
Oh, yes, Mr. Blane,
I received your wire.
Hey, Bud.
Yes, sir?
Check that for me, will you?
Be glad to, sir.
You wait here, I'll bring you a check right away.
If you'd checked out by 3:00, sir we wouldn't have charged you for an extra day.
Sorry.
Not a thing, sir.
We don't have a thing.
Yeah, I know.
Will you put that in Mr. Frank Hugo's box?
Oh, yes, sir. Would you like me to call his room?
No, just put it in this box.
Yes, sir.
Here is the check for your bag, sir.
Keep the change.
Oh, thak your, sir.
Yes?
I want to see Frank Hugo.
If you'd telepohoned from downstairs you'd have found that
Mr. Hugo is not in.
Is there anything further?
Not that I can think of.
Then if you'll allow me,
I'll close...
I told you,
Mr. Hugo's not in!
You his barber?
I'm M. Hugo's private secretary.
That's too bad, I was going to ask you for a shave.
You can't wait in Mr. Hugo's room.
Where is he?
If you have no appointment you'll have to wait downstairs.
I don't like it downstairs.
When will he be back?
I said you'll have to wait downstairs.
Now look: if you don't leave this room at once
I'll have to call the manager.
I wouldn't do that.
Then get out!
Excuse it, please.
Oh...
Hello.
Is Frank in?
No.
Did, uh...
Did you do that?
He'll be all right.
Oh, I wasn't worried.
A lot of people will be very grateful to you.
Jonathan can be awfully stuffy.
Yeah, I noticed.
Do you mind my asking what you're doing here?
Waiting for Frank Hugo.
He ought to be here in a few minutes.
I'm having dinner with him.
Do you expect to join us?
Look, why don't you just sit down and stop pumping?
I was just curious.
You don't intend shooting me, do you?
Did you really expect to find a gun?
Good heavens, you really did.
You must led a fascinating life.
You're not through with me, are you?
Aren't you going to frisk me?
No.
May I have a light?
Sure.
There's one right there on the table.
Shall I answer that?
No, I'll get it.
Hello.
No.
No, Jonathan's not here.
Yeah, this is Mr. Hugo's room.
Oh, hello, Mr. Hugo.
No, there's nobody here.
This is the bellboy speaking.
I just brought some ice.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, I see.
Yes, I will.
That was Frank?
Frank himself.
Call the police.
I don't think this gentleman would approve of that.
Your boss just telephoned.
He said he wouldn't be back until tomorrow.
Well, that's being stoop up rather thoroughly.
You're not leaving?
Yeah.
But we could have dinner in the room.
Frank's already ordered it.
No, thanks.
I'll be seeing Frank early.
Who shall I say called?
Just tell him Shorty's pal called... and will call again.
Hello there, Mr. Gagin.
How about some lunch?
The grill's open.
Who are you?
My name's Retz.
R-E-T-Z-- Retz.
I don't know you.
Well, come along inside.
We'll have a cup of coffee get acquainted, again.
Got my name, huh?
Oh, I got a lot of things.
For instance?
Well, you come in on the 4:00 BUS sat up all the way from Washington D.C. that was a cute little trick you pulled with your note for Frank Hugo to find his room number.
You waited till he phoned he wasn't coming till tomorrow.
Also, you haven't had any lunch.
Neither have I.
How about a bite?
I'll have a cup of coffee and some Danish pastry.
Yes, sir.
What are you having, Gagin?
Not a thing.
That'll be all, then.
I guess you know you're not going to find a room in this town.
The fiesta's got her filled up to her ears.
It starts tomorrow night.
Lots of excitement.
Floats, dancing in the streets--
The indians put on a special show.
You a cop?
That's about right.
Washington?
Government cop.
My, my.
How come you're tailing me, Uncle Sam?
Oh, thank you, ma'am.
You'll excuse me.
Oh, I'm not tailing you.
I got in yesterday ahead of you.
Come for the fiesta?
I didn't know about the fiesta.
You and the fiesta are both gravy.
Who's going to ask the questions-- me or you?
Go ahead.
I'm not used to pumping cops.
Oh, I don't mind.
How come you know me?
Saw you in Washington at Shorty Thompson's inquest.
Some inquest that was, huh?
You testified you had no idea who killed your pal.
Yeah, the cops and I were equally baffled.
I spotted you at the desk here.
Checked on your arrival.
That's the whole mystery, on my end.
Except what you're doing here.
I'm tailing Mr. Hugo.
I thought you knew that.
I don't know anything.
I been watching him for six months.
You don't watch him very close, do you?
You mean you think he killed Shorty?
I'll leave the thinking to you, Uncle Sam.
All right.
This is what I think--
You're here to square things for Shorty by knocking off
Hugo, right?
Go on.
Also, you are as dumb as they come.
I am, huh?
Why, Mr. Hugo's a big man in this part of the world.
He's got lots of friends in this state.
He's too tough for you.
Maybe.
Why don't you smart up?
Leave him to us.
We'll get him.
Anything else on your mind?
Oh, don't rush off.
You know, I wouldn't like it a minute if Mr. Hugo got you.
Wye, you're not a bad fellow.
You're like the rest of the boys--
All cussed up because you fought a war for three years and got nothing but a dangle of ribbons.
Whe don't you let your Uncle Samuel take care of him?
How long you been after him?
A long time--
Too long to let anything happen to it now.
Yeah.
Would be a shame, wouldn't it?
Thanks for the advice, Uncle.
Maybe I sized you up all wrong.
Maybe you're after something else.
And maybe you're working for Hugo.
I told you I worked for the government.
Doesn't the government work for Hugo?
It did all during the war.
Well, if it isn't Jonathan's friend.
He sends you his love.
Mr. Locke, mister...
Gagin.
Mr. Gagin.
How do you do?
Care to have a drink with us?
If I was thirsty.
Maybe he could use a little company.
He looks lonely.
I'm a friend of Frank Hugo.
I told Mr. Locke about your message.
He's going to talk on the phone with Frank in an hour.
We thought you might care to expand it.
No, I don't.
Anything you have to say to Hugo you can say to me, Mr. Gagin.
Please, join us. You can hold your drink in your hand if you're not thirsty.
No, thanks.
If your business is important
I could tell it to Frank and expedite matters, perhaps.
No, I don't think so.
I'm afraid Mr. Gagin can't be seduced.
See you again, Gagin.
Did you find anything?
No, senor, I've been to all the hotels they don't have nothing.
No room single, double, nothing empty in
San Pablo tonight.
Okay, here.
Maybe you try Tres Violetas.
You find something there.
What's that, a hotel?
No, saloon.
Or maybe some
Indian or Mexican have room in his house.
Pretty crowded, but give them a few bucks maybe they move.
What is this... whatchamacallit?
What's that?
The Tres Violetas.
I take you.
Uh, here is the
Tres Violetas, señor.
Thanks.
You.
What are you doing here?
I was waiting.
I'm glad to see you again.
You don't say.
I... I thought I would never see you anymore.
Look, do you know where I can get a room?
A room. Why?
To sleep in.
Mama mia has a room.
Do you know her?
Yes.
Where's she live?
I don't know, I am lost.
I thought you knew this town.
I knew where the hotel was because I passed it before.
I never been to
San Pablo before.
I live in San Melo,
75 miles away.
Okay, okay.
What do you want?
My two friends went away and left me.
Where'd they go?
Inside, looking for muchachos.
For what?
Boys.
Do they know where
Mama Mia lives?
I don't know what they know.
Thanks.
Maybe I go with you?
No, not tonight, Sitting Bull.
You will need me, señor.
What's going on inside your head, huh?
Oh, nothing, señor, nothing.
Only I... I don't know what to do tonight.
Why don't you get yourself a muchacho like your girlfriends?
I don't know how.
You're T
Excuse me.
Yeah, I was talking to your friend outside.
Pila?
Oh, all night she will be outside.
She's crazy.
Yeah, I would'n be surprised
She said something about Mama Mia.
Do you know where she lives?
Oh, si, I know where she live.
I take you.
She don't know nothing about Mama Mia.
Excuse me.
Whiskey.
Tequila.
No, I want a big whiskey.
Big one, big one.
Tequila, eh?
No change, senor.
Too big, too big, no change.
That's the smallest thing I got.
Señor, my name is Pancho.
I would like to help you.
I will be your friend.
I tell you what I going to do...
Is 20 pesos.
Is your 20, huh?
Yeah.
He can change only ten, eh?
Yeah.
So we drink ten, and everybody is happy, eh?
You want to make everybody happy, si?
Sure, let's make everybody happy.
Make mine whiskey.
I don't want to burn a hole in my neck.
Amigo, you are the blood of my heart.
You are true friend.
To you.
Down the hatch.
Manito, fill up my friend's glass.
Full! Big!
The big drinks is most best.
Hey, listen.
You know why that man sing, amigo?
He sings because tomorrow we burn zozobra.
He's god of bad luck.
He's got face more worse than me.
Tomorrow we burn zozobra-- and we have fiesta.
No more zozobra, no more bad luck.
Big drink for everybody.
So quick we drink up all the change.
There's a lot more where it came from.
When I see you, I say
"this is kind of fellow more proud than you, Pancho."
Pancho very proud man.
Oye, chato, give everybody drink.
Big drink for everybody.
Pancho is buying!
Yeah, you lend me ten dollars.
I pay you tomorrow, eh?
Amigo, my beautiful amigo!
You got kind of face I like.
You come in here for something.
You tell Panchito what you look for he get it for you.
Yeah, you tell Panchito.
I'm looking for a place to sleep in.
What, you got no place for sleep?
That's the kind of man I like
The man with no place.
I will give you the most fine place to sleep in all San Pablo.
I'm your man.
Fill them up.
Hey, what's the matter?
You don't feel good?
You drink whole bottle and don't feel good?
That's bad.
I feel fine.
No, something is wrong.
I sing and something says, "Pancho, shut up."
That's you.
I didn't tell you to shut up.
Your heart tells me.
What's the matter, you're not Pancho's friend?
I'm nobody's friend.
What's the matter?
Somebody follow us.
I don't hear nobody.
Somebody walk soft.
Oh, it's a girl.
Oh, she no good... too skinny.
I told you once before tonight. no dice!
Oh, she your girl, eh?
I don't know her.
That's all right, you can tell Pancho.
I don't know her and I don't want to know her.
Now, go on home and play with your buffaloes.
Hey, that's right.
She's too skinny... no good.
Ah, them kids--
The fiesta bring them like honey.
They come for sing, for dance for get fellow, have a good time then go home and pull the plow for a year.
That one pretty skinny.
You get much better more later on, eh?
Hey, ski...
Oh, she gone.
My goodness where she go, eh?
Where we going?
I show you.
Where's the house?
The house, señor.
You're drunk.
Is possible.
But never too drunk for know my own house.
Have a look.
The palace of Pancho!
That's a fine ceiling, that's good walls
Beautifullandlord.
Especial for you.
Yeah, give me the bottle.
How you like my house, amigo?
I've been in worse houses.
Who owns that outfit?
Tio vivo?
She is mine.
I own everything.
12 beautiful horses...
Three beautiful chariots...
Whole beautiful orchestra--
All Pancho's.
Hey, you drink pretty good for a gringo.
Yeah.
Some people is happy when they got money.
Me, I'm only happy when I got nothing.
Nothing and a friend.
So long as Pancho got somebody he can tell: amigo, I love you that's enough.
They can keep everything else.
Keep the whole world.
Give Pancho...
Only Pancho.
What do you want?
You want a ride?
Yes.
Wait a minute,
I'll wake up fatso.
Hey, Pancho.
You got a customer.
All closed, no more customers.
Come on, come on, get up.
I told you, she too skinny.
Lots more better manana.
Come on, Pancho, she wants a ride.
Turn it, will you?
No, no ride.
Is late, Tio Vivo closed.
Music wake the peoples.
Okay, no music but turn it, huh?
I don't give no free ride, is rule.
Break the rule.
Ten centavos--one ride.
Okay, here.
Did you ever ride on one of them before?
No.
Well, go on, get going, go on.
Which one?
Try the pink one.
Okay, Sitting Bull
Why don't you give us a war whoop?
You know...
That's all.
Diez centavos, ten cents, one ride.
Ishtam, the good goddess.
What's she good for?
To keep away death.
Very fine charm.
I got a better charm.
Soldier gun.
Why?
Best charm in the world.
Keeps away the bogeyman.
Someone is here.
What?
Someone is here.
Who's here?
Someone is hiding out there.
Gagin?
Yeah.
Sorry to wake you up but I got to thinking maybe we ought to have a little talk.
We had a talk, Uncle Sam.
Sure, but another one.
I got a couple of new ideas.
Oh...
Go on, beat it, Scrambo.
Go on over there, way over there.
I told you I didn't want you removing Mr. Hugo from the scene but I'm not worrying about that anymore not the way you're handling it.
Walking in here and telling him
Shorty's pal is looking for him!
Playing it tough, huh?
They've got a couple of bad boys out looking for you.
This interest you?
Yeah...kind of.
Those mugs that
Mr. Locke put on you will be arount to the Three Violetas.
They'll find out the same lead I did.
What time does it open?
Around 9:00.
I got an extra bed in my room.
You'll be a little more comfortable there.
No.
I'll stay here.
Kind of figured
I was wasting my time.
Hey, Retz.
Yeah?
Thanks.
Don't mention it.
Say, fine beautiful morning, mi amigo.
How you feel?
Fine.
How you sleep in Pancho's palace?
Like a baby, eh?
Yeah, like a baby.
Where'd you get this razor?
It's a very fine razor.
I shaved with it myself once.
What time is it?
About ten minutes past 7:00.
I have a fine deam last night.
I dream all my horses is alive and we all riding on desert for hunting lions.
And I am young again.
Service, eh?
Where you get that new bucket?
I find it.
That's very fine bucket.
Is sign of good luck when you find new bucket.
Yeah?
I got a looking glass, small one.
I don't need it.
I'm all through.
Why do you have to look like that?
Lile what?
Like you come out of a sideshow.
What's a sideshow?
Place where they keep freaks.
I look like a freak?
You look like zip-what-is-it?
Why do I look like that?
Well, I don't know.
Maybe it's the dress.
This is my granmother's dress.
She gave it to me when
I come to the fiesta.
I never had a dress so nice as this.
Well, it might be all right if you took some of them spangles off.
I take them off.
You might also comb your hair.
My hair?
Is not right?
All right for mice to sleep in.
Give me my coat.
Here.
Go get yourself a permanent wave or something.
Maybe a manicure, huh?
No, I can't take the money.
Why not?
Is too much.
You can count, that's something, huh?
Go on, take it, make yourself look human.
You like me if I look human?
Look, Sitting Bull
I'm not buying any trouble this trip.
I got other things on my mind.
Go on now, beat it.
Ten dollar?
Mi amigo, you crazy for waste time on a stick.
Fellow like you can get princess, fat one.
Yeah, I've had princesses, all kinds.
I got one now back East.
That's crazy.
Why don't you bring her to the fiesta?
She's busy... with another guy.
I don't think I like him, that other guy.
Ah, don't say that, he's okay.
He's got what it takes.
Dough.
Mr. Hugo in?
I said is Mr. Hugo in?
Who is it?
The man who was here yesterday.
Oh, Shorty's pal-- let him in.
Mr. Hugo will see you.
You want me to come back for the shampoo?
I'll call you later.
Mr. Locke in his room?
No, Mr. Hugo, he left ten minutes ago.
Wait downstairs.
You want me in, boss?
No, out.
All right, Mr. Gagin, what can I do for you?
Yes, this is Mr. Hugo.
No, I can't talk to him now.
No more calls till I let you know.
Would you like to look around?
I don't mind company.
Sit down.
I'm glad to see you, Mr. Gagin.
How's our friend, Mr. Retz?
He's okay.
I hear you been talking to him.
What would I have to talk to him about?
I don't know.
Comrade in arms.
You're both shooting at the same target, aren't you?.
He's no pal of mine.
Good for you.
Cigar?
No, thanks.
So you're Shorty's pal.
That's right.
Shorty was a nice guy.
Yeah, he was.
Weren't you in the same outfit together--Pacific area?
Tried to get in myself.
Too bad they had to turn you down.
I gave Shorty a job when he got out, a good job.
Yeah, I know.
Hundred a week just to see that people didn't bother me too much--
Should have solved all his postwar problems.
Too bad Shorty turned out to be a crook.
Got himself all crumbed up reaching for easy money.
That's kind of funny talk coming from a guy who's done rather well out of the government--
Kind of like spitting in my own face.
That's what you're thinking, isn't it, Gagin?
I'm thinking.
Our friend Shorty was the kind of crook that nobody likes, not even me who am rather broad-minded about such things.
Short took something from me and tried to sell it back.
I don't like blackmailers.
Nor would you if you were in my business.
They constitute a very bad industrial hazard.
He refused to give it to me, there was a fight.
Your pal Shorty wasn't as tough as he thought he was.
So you had him killed.
Let's say he lost the argument.
To three guys with blackjacks.
Were there three?
Three pretty stupid guys, too.
Stupid?
Yeah. They didn't get what they were after.
They didn't?
No, I got it.
A cancelled check for a hundred grand on a Mexican bank, signed by you and made out to a guy who was making patriotic speeches about the time
I was getting a tan in a place called New Guinea.
You sound like a disillusioned patriot.
The number of the check is 6431.
You've got me convinced.
It wouldn't be on you, would it?
No, of course not, you wouldn't be that dumb.
All right, Mr. Gagin, how much do you want?
30 grand.
Shorty only wanted 15.
The extra 15 is on account of Shorty.
A real friend. Don't kid yourself.
You're doing it for you just like I did what I did for me.
Look, do I get the 30 grand or do I turn the check over to Mr. Retz?
So that's the way it's gonna be.
That's the way it's gonna be.
Look, Gagin, let's hit it on the nose.
You and me, we, eat out of the same dish.
You used to think if you were a square guy, worked hard played on the level, things would come your way.
You found out you were wrong.
All you get is pushed around.
You found people are intested in only one thing--the payoff.
That's all I'm interested in.
You know, Gagin, I like you.
There are two kinds of people in this world: ones that fiddle around worrying about whether things are right or wrong and guys like us.
Do I get the 30 grand?
It'll be pretty hot--
Are you sure you want it?
I'm sure.
You know the spot I'm in.
I'd be a dope to pay blackmail.
And if you don't?
There might be a photostatic copy of the chek.
Then you have to pay again.
Now he may remember the check number and bank.
I'd be buying practically nothing for my 30 grand but a headache.
20 years for stealing from the government is also a headache.
Yeah, that's worth thinking about.
I'm getting tired of that check haunting me.
I'll take a chance on you being a square blackmailer.
I'll give you 15 grand.
Well, I came to enjoy the fiesta.
I'll charge it up to pleasure.
You'll want it in cash, naturally.
Right here in my hand.
I don't carry that kind of money with me.
It'll take me a few hours to get it.
Where can I reach you?
Here.
I'd rather you didn't clutter up my rooms.
I'll let the money around, say, 7:00. See you then?
Couldn't we find someplace more public?
More public?
Yeah, it's a sensible precaution.
You know where the Tip-Top cafe is?
I'll find it.
And you'll have that little item.
Youll get the check when I get the dough.
I don't even trust my mother.
And I guess a blackmailes can't be too careful.
Must be an exciting way to make a living.
I'll have to try it sometime.
I'll see you at the Tip-Top cafe.
At 7:00.
Good morning.
Waiting for you friend?
Known him long?
Yesterday.
You like him?
Well, why don't you help him?
He's in trouble.
I know.
You mean you know the kind of trouble he's in?
Yes.
What kind of trouble would you say it is?
He will die, maybe.
Yeah?
When?
Soon.
How soon?
Before long.
How do you get that?
I saw.
What did you see?
I saw him dead.
Beats me how you get that.
You saw him dead?
Oh, you mean you dreamed it.
No... I saw it.
Yesterday when he came to the merry-go-round.
I saw his face.
Dead.
His eyes were closed, the skin was white.
He was dead.
Not a bad hunch.
I don't see things like that but I got it figured my way.
Listen, I'm trying to help him.
Do you believe that?
If he tells me.
Hi, Retz.
Why, hello there.
I just been talking to your friend.
How'd you like to take a wald?
Lots of fiesta doings starting up.
No, I'm not here for the fiesta either.
That's what I figured.
You didn't come for the show.
You come for the money.
You know, I been a little slow on the pickup.
I don't know why.
I just didn't figure you for a shakedown job.
I'm after Hugo.
You've got some evidence that can help me send him up but I haven't any idea what it is.
You're trying to sell it to him but the chances are ten to one you'll wind up like Shorty.
I'm asking you for that evidence, officially.
See, I'm not talking for myself.
I'm talking, like you say, for Uncle Sam.
You tell Uncle Sam to go take a walk for himself.
And look Copper, don't wave any flags at me.
I seen enough flags.
Well, I've spoken my piece.
I've heard enough pieces too.
They don't register anymore.
Okay... soldier.
I'll be seeing you around.
I'll be around.
What happened to you?
Do you like?
Do I look human?
Oh, brother.
What else should I do?
Well, you can't do anything else-- you've done everything.
Are you hungry?
I ate an apple.
No, no, no, I mean food.
Come on, it's a little early but we'll have some lunch.
Where?
In the restaurant.
Oh, no, I can't.
Why not?
What's the matter, don't you answer questions?
Aw, you don't have to be afraid of a restaurant.
All you have to do is walk in, sit down and pretend you're a human being.
Yeah, I want to sit over there.
Hey.
See anything you want?
Look, if you can't read, say so.
I can read.
Go ahead and read it.
See if there's anything you want to eat.
I'm not hungry.
Uh... two fruit cocktails two trout with au gratin potatoes two orders of salad, thousand island dressing got that?
Yes, sir.
We'll order dessert later.
Yes, sir.
Where you been living, in a barrel?
I live in San Melo.
You know, it's funny.
For a minute I thought I was back in New Guinea, again.
Only in New Guinea they're darker.
Who is?
Girls.
You like them darker?
You going to laugh at me, I''ll go away.
Nobody's laughing at you.
What a goon.
Lot of different kinds of fruit, all chopped up.
Go ahead, eat it, it's good.
That smells very good.
That's to kep it cold-- that's very nice.
In San Melo ice is very hard to get.
We put everything down the well by string and...
I must talk to you, Mr. Gagin.
It's very important and I've only got a few minutes.
Frank is coming down.
You said you put things down the well, huh?
Please, couldn't we go to another table?
No, we couldn't.
Can't you see we're having lunch?
But I must talk to you alone.
I'm terribly sorry.
Please, Mr. Gagin, I'm only asking three minutes but they're very important minutes, for both of us.
Okay.
You go on over and sit at another table over there. I'll call you.
You will excuse us for a moment, won't you?
What's on your mind?
Frank just told me what you're doing and I rushed right down here hoping to find you.
You don't know me.
You have no reason to believe anything I say but you can't lose anything by listening.
All right, I'm listening.
He's very clever, Frankie.
He's seen to it I have everything except money
But I could get out... with money.
I know what you're thinking.
What's she up to?
Why do I even listen to her?
You said it, sister.
You're such a fool asking for only $30,000.
Do you know what he'd have asked for, in your place?
A million, and gotten it.
Let me do it--
I'll get you twice as much and get what I want too.
How?
Will you let me?
I asked you how.
Don't give him the check.
Give it o a lawyer in Tulsa or anyplace else, New York,
Chicago- some honest lawyer.
Put it in a sealed envelope and pay him a thousand-dollar fee.
And tell him that if anything happens to either you or me he's to send the envelope to the F.B.I.
Then you tell Frank what you've done and ask for $100,000.
When that's gone, ask for another $100,000 and we become sort of... partners with Frankie.
I've learned this sort of high finance from Frankie himself.
Too rich for me.
But don't you see it's more than the money?
It's only way to keep alive.
You don't think Frank's gonna let you enjoy it even if he gives it to you.
I'll enjoy it.
All right, I know you're not afraid
But why not get more?
It's so simple.
No, I don't play.
But why?
I don't trust that lawyer
The one who clips us for a grand.
I said we've find an honest one.
Hugo buys them all, even the honest ones.
But he won't know who he is.
You'll know.
Oh, I see...
And of course you can't trust me.
Right.
Then do it yourself.
I'll trust you.
Too many angles.
Please, it's tremendous if you do it right.
He has millions.
You're a smart cookie, aren't you?
But I'll do it my way.
But it's stupid.
So stupid.
Maybe.
I found out something though.
There are a lot of people smarter than me and they aren't up nights figuring out how to help me.
But I'll buy you a drink.
What'll you have?
Nothing, thank you.
Hey!
Come on back.
What's your name?
Pila.
Pila? Yeah.
Pila, I want you to meet
Miss Marjorie Lundeen.
How do you do?
I'm terribly sorry about intruding like this.
This must be dull town after the fiesta dusty and hot and full of flies.
I'm glad I don't live here because I like bright lights and nightspots and lots of people.
I'm afraid I wasn't cut out for...
I'll try to see you later.
Please think over what I told you.
It was nice meeting you.
She make you feel bad?
I guess you're not used to her kind of ladies, huh?
She's very beautiful.
Yeah... they usually are.
She has very nice clothes, and diamonds.
Diamonds... and a dead fish where her heart ought to be.
I known a lot of them babies.
She's not a baby.
Babies is what you call dames, do you understand that?
No.
Do you understand what a human being is?
Yes.
Well, they're not human beings.
They're dead fish with a lot of perfume on them.
You touch them and you always get stung.
You always lose.
You do not like?
No.
My friend Maria is like that.
Jose bought her a new pair of shoes and she wouldn't wear them for him but tonight at a dance she's going to wear them in front of other men and I told her she shouldn't be like that because Jose bought them for her and she should wear them for him because a man doesn't like for a girl always to go barefoot.
Go on, eat your lunch.
I got some business
I got to attend to.
Sounds like the fiesta's started.
No, not till 8:00.
They're taking old Zozobra to the plaza for the big burning.
There's still time.
Who ordered squab?
I did.
There's not much there.
I'm not very hungry.
Bring the wine now, will you?
Yes, sir.
How is everything, Mr. Hugo?
What's that?
Well, look who's here.
Must be 7:00.
On the nose.
You're on time.
I said "How is everything?"
You'll have to wait a few minutes.
The bank messenger is coming from Tulsa.
You all set with your end of it?
Yeah.
He's scared still
I'll stand him up.
The messenger phoned he'd be a little late.
Why don't you wait at the bar and let you know when he comes.
Why wait at the bar?
Pull up a chair.
There's plenty of room.
I prefer Mr. Gagin at the bar.
Don't be silly, Frank.
I feel like dancing.
After all, it is a fiesta.
Your squab will get cold.
Keep it warm for me, will you, Frank?
Mind?
Dancing will be better than sitting at the bar.
I've been furious at you all day.
You've cost me $50,000 by your bullheadedness.
50,000 and freedom and fun.
I don't know why I feel this way about you.
Oh, I'm not making a pass at you.
I'm just being stupid.
What's on your mind?
You.
What are we waiting for?
He's watching us.
I'm afraid to talk.
Come with me.
He isn't going to give you the money.
No?
He's figured out one of his typical tricks.
What?
Is he watching us?
No.
Have you got a cigarette?
I shouldn't be telling you this.
You certainly haven't done anything to deserve it.
But there isn't any bank messenger coming.
There's someone else.
Who?
I don't know.
Oh. I'm sorry.
Don't I know you?
I don't know.
Do you?
Everyone knows everyone on fiesta night.
Are you dancing?
Not so you'd notice.
Where's Gagin?
He stopped to talk to someone.
It's a good orchestra, isn't it? Dance?
Some other time.
More wine?
No, thank you.
Double bourbon.
Yes, sir.
Squab-- you should've had a steak.
There's a couple of your friends outside.
You better go have a look.
What friends?
So they aren't your friends but you should look anyway.
You should've known better than to send a couple of knife fighters against Gagin.
I don't know anything about Gagin.
Maybe, but your friends don't look so good out there.
Mr. Retz, I'm having my dinner.
You're giving me indigestion.
I don't care what kind of a badge you're wearing.
Sore, ain't you?
Glad to see it.
You wouldn't be sore if you'd got what you wanted from Gagin.
I'm grateful to you,
Mr. Hugo--thanks.
Take Miss Santoya to the fiesta, will you, Jim?
Come along, my dear.
I'll be at the hotel.
Call you there.
Beat it.
Yes, sir.
What happened?
They got him--I saw it.
But he got away.
Take her to the fiesta.
And keep your eyes open for him.
He's crawling around someplace.
Bring him back to the hotel.
What about the cops?
What about them?
I'm worried.
I'm not worried about a thing.
Who are you?
I phoned you.
I heard you were in town.
Where are they?
Right over here.
Broke this baby's arm.
This one looks a little dead.
Couldn't be deader.
Here's a lot of blood.
This one's missing his knife.
Must have left it in the other guy.
If he had a knife.
Winke? He always carried a knife.
Pretty bad boy and plenty tough, too.
That guy can't be far.
Maybe we can run him down with all that blood out of him.
Let's look in the cars.
Get the knife out.
I will stop the bleeding.
Tighter.
Pull it tighter.
The police are there.
It is safe.
Has the bleeding stopped?
Yes.
Help me get out of here.
What's that?
The fiesta.
Walk slow... and keep in the dark.
Does it hurt?
Yeah, it hurts.
Mi amigo, how is it?
I need a little help.
Oh, I fix you.
What kind of hurt?
Knife.
Where?
In the back.
Knife is good.
Is more easy to fix.
I got knife three times.
When you're young everybody sticks knife in you.
Lie still, take big drink and pretty soon you're more better than before.
Sit down, niña.
Hold his head.
First you take big drink.
Drink long time.
Hey, you fix this, eh?
Eh, that's a good kid.
I leave it alone but I make more tighter.
How you feel now, mi amigo?
Give me...
Give me a little more of that.
Sure, sure.
Somebody else was hurt?
Yes.
Two.
One is dead.
Ay, good.
Your coat is pretty bad.
I don't think we can fix him.
Give me... give me that...wallet.
Inside pocket.
She's here, all right.
Get my gun.
No, no, she's gone, this gun.
No...
Right hand pocket.
No gun, mi amigo.
You don't need gun.
You got Pancho now.
I'll be all right.
Sure.
I'll be all right in a few minutes.
Stick around.
Sure, sure.
I don't like them two guys.
They look bad.
What they come to Pancho for?
They are after him.
Quick.
We hide him.
Be careful.
In... easy.
No, no, no.
Niños, stay on.
Everybody, free ride.
Stay on, stay on.
Free ride, free ride.
You want to get on?
Ten cents.
Next ride right away.
Come over here.
What do you want?
I said, "come over here".
You looking for something?
We're looking for a guy named Pancho.
You find him.
That's me.
Where's Gagin?
Gagin?
Who's he?
The fellow you met in the saloon last night.
Oh...him.
He's Gagin.
He don't told me his name.
Where is he?
How should I know?
Why you ask Pancho?
I don't know nothing.
Where'd you take him last night?
Last night I am drunk.
All I know is I wake up,
I am still drunk.
What do you fellows want?
Why...
Where's Gagin?
Please.
I don't know nothing.
I don't know.
If I know, I tell you.
Hey!
Now, cut the lying.
Where is he?
Oh, why...
You hurt Panchito?
You think he's holding out?
Not that fat slob.
He don't know from nothing.
It's all right.
It's all right now.
They gone.
A couple of fellows just tell me your name.
Pleased to know you,
Mr. Gagin.
They want to know,
"Where is Gagin?"
I don't know.
Boom in the nose.
I don't know.
Boom in the mouth.
I don't know.
I fall down, but I don't know.
I told you Pancho very proud man.
I'm going to cut you in, Pancho.
Cut me in?
On what, mi amigo?
Five grand.
Grand?
5,000 bucks.
You got that much money?
I'm going to get it.
Lots of people going to get lots of things but they don't.
You ain't got it yet?
Not yet.
We're going to get it.
We got to get going.
No, no, not now--
You are sick.
I'm not going to get any better if those guys come back.
Right, he goes away.
Maybe they come back.
Fiesta come here, dances here.
Somebody see him--
They find him.
They're not going to stop looking.
I'll be all right as soon as I get my punch back.
We will go to San Melo.
Where's that?
Two hours by bus.
Are you sure there's a bus?
Si, it leaves at 10:00.
We got an hour and a half to wait.
We can't wait in that bus station.
You go to the Three Violetas.
You Pancho's friend.
They remember.
Here, take him.
Hurry, quick.
Hey, listen.
They burn Zozobra, the god of bad luck.
Too bad they don't burn him hour ago.
You not feel good, señor?
Whose sombrero?
Is mine.
I want to borrow it-- how much?
You will bring it back sometime.
Take him back there.
Nobody see you.
Big fight?
Pancho help?
How is he?
He's all right.
We will stay here.
Then we will go to the bus.
How do you feel now?
Yeah, you ought to know what's going on.
I know.
They tried to kill you.
And you want to know...why?
Because they are bad.
And I'm good, huh?
Yes.
I will take care of you.
You're just... you're just like Shorty.
No brains.
Don't talk.
Is the hurt better now?
It's hot in here.
Hot in...in the jungle, too.
The rains turns to steam.
Please don't go to sleep.
Okay.
Okay, Shorty.
Okay.
I got something for you.
Here...
Put that in your shirt.
Hang onto it.
Don't let nobody touch it.
Nobody.
Nobody...
That a boy, Shorty.
That a boy.
M. Gagin.
Mr. Gagin, quick, they're coming.
Where is the ticket seller?
Next bus don't leave till 10:00.
Where is the ticket seller?
Oh, he's gone down the street to watch the fiesta.
San Pablo, San Pablo.
La... La Fonda hotel?
What?
Hotel.
Over there, señor.
I didn't order a drink.
Nevermind!
Leave it there.
Close those windows.
Yes, sir.
That's better.
I'll get it.
Yeah.
What's that?
I can't hear you.
Yeah.
They di...
What's the matter with you!
Don't call me unless you've got something to tell me!
Mr. Gagin!
Mr. Gagin.
Mr. Gagin, please.
Which...
Which one of you... is Frank Hugo?
I'm Hugo.
Put that thing away.
Don't you see he's out on his feet?
See if anyone else is with him.
Nobody.
Bring him in and shut the door.
Sit him down.
Who's the girl?
What's the matter with him?
He cannot remember.
He's hurt.
Better see if he has a gun.
What did you want to talk to me about?
Shorty.
Yeah, you're his pal.
You got Shorty.
But I was pretty dumb.
I didn't get what I was after.
What was I after?
Check.
You want to sell it to me.
How much do you want for it?
Fif...
30 grand.
It's a deal.
I'll pay it in cash.
You got the check with you?
Money.
Right here in my hand.
Can't you find it?
There's no check in here.
What'd you do with it?
Come on, where is it?
What did you do with it?
I don't know.
What do you know about it?
I don't know nothing.
Where'd you pick him up?
At tio vivo.
He was hurt.
He came there.
Where'd he go then?
I don't know.
You don't know!
You were waiting!
What were you doing with him?
He's sick.
Please, he is sick.
Gagin...
Wake up, Gagin.
I got the money right here.
Now, where's the check?
Try and think...The check, Shorty's check.
What did yo do with it?
I want to see...Frank Hugo.
Can I take him away now?
Get him a drink.
That's the stuff.
You feel better now, don't you?
You remember where the check is.
You were afraid you wouldn't get the money but here's the money.
Where's the check?
I don't know.
Sure you do.
You put it someplace.
Now, where did you put it?
I don't remember.
You're gonna remember.
It was in your wallet.
Yeah.
But you took it out.
I...
I took it out.
Where did you put it?
I...
I don't remember.
Maybe I can help him remember.
Yeah, go ahead.
Where is it?
He don't know!
He lost it.
Where'd he lose it?
I don't know.
Then how do you know he lost it?
Maybe she'll talk for you, Tommy.
Where is it?
Come on, you know where it is.
She don't know where it is, boss.
She knows all right... go on, keep it up.
Why don't you help him, Mr. Hugo, sir?
You're the one knows how to treat a lady.
Who let you in?
Maybe you don't like knocking on doors.
Maybe you're like this guy over here.
His line is blackmail.
One of these haywire veterans trying to put the bite on me for 30 grand.
What's your bite, mister, is it...ow!
Gagin.
Gagin, get up, boy.
Get over there!
Wake up, son.
It's all right, miss.
You can come over here now.
It's all right.
I been following you, Gagin ever since you left the merry-go-round.
Sorry to use you as a bait, but I wanted to be in on it when he tried to wrangle that check out of you.
Stay behind me, son.
Stay behind me.
Need it bad for evidence.
Could have got it, too if I'd waited but I guess I just couldn't wait ain't nice seeing folks get pushed around.
We're in bad company here.
Come on.
Go ahead, Gagin, be a sucker.
Come here to pick up some easy money just as it's in your pocket, you walk out.
This guy makes me laugh--
His idea of big money.
He's got me and all he asks for is 30 grand.
Guys like you work all their lives trying to earn meat and potatoes.
You end up borrowing enough money to pay for a hole in the ground to get buried in.
Then when you get a chance to make some real scratch what do you do?
Mice like you and Shorty.
You ask for peanuts!
You know what's going to happen when you get out of here?
He's going to give you a lot of gas about duty and honor.
Fill you with fancy words like "responsability", "patriotism".
That's how he's going to get that check.
And what're you gonna have? Nothing!
Sure maybe I'll get sent to the pen.
That won't put money in your pocket.
I don't know why I talk to a guy like you.
All your life you waste time worrying about small -fry things-- about a job, about a two-buck raise about getting a pension.
Why don't you ask for 300 grand?
300,000 bucks, Gagin!
It'll set you up for the rest of your life!
Give me...
Give me that check.
Here, Retz.
Now you're talking!
He can't hear you, Gagin.
His tin ear's busted.
Maybe he can hear this.
Like to eat with my hands.
It gets me closer to the food.
What's the matter, eggs cold?
Coffee stale?
Toast burned?
I'm not hungry.
Huh! Funny thing.. Every time I fret, I can't eat.
What makes you thing
I'm fretting?
Tow bucks worth of breakfast gone to pot.
It ain't the five grand you promised Pancho, is it?
No. He never expected to get that anyway.
Couldn't be that 300,000 you turned down the other night.
Fat chance I'd have of collecting that with you around.
Is it the kid?
What kid?
That little mouse with the big eyes.
You wouldn't be fretting about her.
Why should I worry about her?
All I got to do is just say good-bye and that's the end of it.
It don't worry me none.
No, she don't worry you at all.
All you got to do is say good-bye and that's it.
You certainly are one hungry man.
Shucks, I got nobody to say good-bye to.
Any particular way you going to tell her?
I'll tell her.
Sure, but what'll you say?
That's my department.
I'll see you at the bus station.
I check your bags on the bus, señor.
Oh...
Thanks.
Hope you don't mind if I kind of hang around see how you handle the situation.
Never been very smart with the women myself.
Maybe you can learn me a thing or two.
All you got to do is say good-bye.
Yeah, just say,
"so long, kid" and that's the end of it.
Maybe she won't even be here.
Then you won't have to say nothing.
That'll make you happy.
You think maybe whe won't, huh?
Nah, you don't know dames.
You don't know what they like.
They like to get their hooks in your.
You don't know what kind of a fuss they make.
I'll fix it.
Well, looks like this is your lucky day.
I don't see her around.
Mr. Gagin, my friend.
Howdy.
Glad to see you.
How are you, Pancho?
I just came over to say so long.
So long? Oh, is sad word.
But you make me happy if it's not too long.
Yeah.
Uh, about that money...
Oh, forget it.
My horses give me all the bucks I want.
We all same kind of peoples.
We all born for be broke.
I don't let you go home in the bus.
I take you Pony Express.
But you see how it is- they all busy.
Pancho!
Pancho!
Do me a favor, will you?
Oh, sure, señor.
Anything, anything.
If Pila shows up will you tell her that...
Pila, Pila.
You tell her yourself, señor.
Hey...
Hello.
You remember me?
Did you have a good time at the fiesta?
I just stopped over to thank... Pancho.
Yeah, swell fellow, Pancho.
Also, I wanted to thank...
Uh, what's-her-name.
Remember me to your grandmother.
She'll be glad to see you.
Lot of people will be glad to see you.
What I...
What I'm trying to say...
What I... mean...
Good-bye, señor.
Well, say good-bye to the lady.
"Which way to the La Fonda hotel?"
"I will show you the hotel."
Hello, Charlie.
So be it, Miss Lily Mars.
Have your old career. Go to New York City.
Go on the stage.
All I gotta say is good luck and goodbye.
-Good morning, Charlie.
-Good morning.
-Hello, Charlie.
-I forgot my hat.
-Got any more bubble gum?
-No.
Oh, Lily, Charlie's back!
Lily, Charlie's back already!
-Lily, Lily!
-Lily, Lily!
No, no, I don't wanna see her.
I just want my hat.
-Lily, here's Charlie! Lily!
-Lily!
Davey, have you seen my hat?
I don't collect hats. I collect doorknobs.
Ain't she a beauty?
Oh, Lily, Charlie's back!
I am not. I am not.
Oh, there it is.
Oh, excuse me.
-Hello, Charlie.
-Look, Mama.
Oh, you got it. It's lovely.
Davey, get me the top for this.
-Well, goodbye, Mrs. Mars.
-Goodbye, Charlie.
I'll be sorry not to see you again,
Mrs. Mars.
Oh, now, now, Charlie.
People shouldn't be mad at people.
Goodbye, Charlie.
Charles.
Hey, Charlie, wait for me.
Never again, you-- You actress.
Poor Charles.
He's so young.
So very young.
And it hurts me to hurt him...
...but what can I do?
-Mama.
-Oh, go on, dear.
I'm not laughing at you.
I like to see you act.
-Mother.
-Oh, now, I'm not mother. I'm Mama.
Here's the hat for Mrs. Thornway.
-Davey, where's the top to this?
-Here it is, Mama.
Lily, can I go to Mrs. Thornway's house with you?
No, Davey, dear.
Her doorknobs might tempt you.
Oh, they already have.
-Lily, please take me.
-No.
Well, then could you sort of maybe get one for me?
-Of course not.
-Oh, but they're such superdupers.
-All right.
-Here you are, dear.
I may not be back for some time...
...but when I come back, I have a big surprise for you. That's for luck.
-Good luck.
-Thank you.
-Good luck.
-Thank you, bye.
Goodbye.
Good morning, Miss Lily.
Morning, Andrew.
I brought Mrs. Thornway's hat.
-I'll take it for you.
-Oh, well...
...I know how busy she must be this morning...
-...but, Andrew, I simply must see her.
-Yeah?
-Yeah, come right in.
-All right.
-She's in the doctor's office.
-Oh, thank you.
Well, I'll tell John just as soon as he gets here.
Come in, Lily.
Well, he should be here in a few minutes if his plane's on time.
Yes, Mr. Vail.
Yes, Mr. Vail, I understand.
You and Miss Rekay are motoring here.
You'll arrive early this afternoon.
And you think it would be a good idea to shoot Irene in the first act.
Yes, I'll tell John. Goodbye.
Mrs. Thornway, I brought your hat.
It isn't exactly what you ordered, but--
Just a minute, Lily.
And wants to shoot--
Oh, bother.
He wants to shoot some girl.
But what girl and in what act?
-Irene in the first act.
-Thank you.
Mrs. Thornway, when you ask your son about a part for me...
...will you tell him
I'd rather not play Irene.
-You wouldn't?
-Not if she gets killed in the first act.
-Let's see the hat.
-Will you tell him?
If he says no, will you try and make him give me a part...
...even a little one?
Maybe Irene?
Lily, the last time I was able to make
John Thornway do anything, he was 10.
He wanted to join the circus.
I persuaded him not to by locking him in the cellar.
Well, if I could just meet him and maybe act for him a little.
Lily, dear, he's going to be frightfully busy.
He always is.
Here today to close an old show...
...gone tomorrow to open a new one.
That's John.
Never a minute for anything but show business.
Well, I'm show business.
My dear, but--
My dear child. Oh, my dear child.
I know you'll love it after you get used to it.
The fashion magazine said it's the latest.
I know-- Oh, well,
I wouldn't cut the feather if I--
That's John. I know his slam.
-Mimi!
-Lily, dear.
Mimi!
-You better wait in here.
-All right.
Don't come out until I have John nicely buttered up.
All right.
-John.
-Hello, Mimi.
-Welcome home, dear.
-Well, you--
-Do you like it?
-Well, it--
-Do you?
-Yes.
Well, then that's good enough for me.
Oh, Mimi, it's good to see you again.
I hope you had a nice restful trip, dear.
I did. I worked on the script of the new play from New York to Indiana.
-Any telegrams for me?
-Five so far...
...but the day is young yet.
They're on the desk.
John?
Oh, John, it's beautiful.
-Oh, but, John, you--
-Yes, I know, I know. I shouldn't've done it.
I have a message for you from Owen Vail.
Oh, he phoned?
Asked me to tell you that Isobel is not coming by train with the company.
She's motoring here from Chicago with him.
Oh, well, that's fine.
And Isobel is--
Well, Isobel is Isobel.
Now look, Mimi, I don't care what Isobel does off the stage.
I love her as an actress.
I adore her as a leading lady.
I'll do anything I can to keep her happy in the theatre.
But I definitely, flatly, am not going to humor Miss Rekay...
...by becoming one of her husbands.
John, do you remember Henry Mars?
Used to come here often to tune the piano.
-That's the man.
-Yeah.
John, he died several years ago.
-He did? I'm sorry to hear that.
-He left a wife and five children.
Nobody knows how they manage, but they do.
Everybody in Midhaven worries about the Marses, except the Marses.
The oldest child's name is Lily.
That's Lily.
She's such a remarkable child, and so talented.
-She acts.
-Yes.
-Experience?
-Oh, loads of it.
-Peter Pan, Macbeth, the Follies.
-Oh, really?
Well, the Midhaven High School Follies.
John. John!
John!
Mimi, there's only one thing in the world
I will not do for you and that is it.
-I have seen my last amateur.
-But Lily's unusual.
Unusual. Oh, Mother.
There's a Lily Mars in every town and all alike, full of hope and so hopeless.
I'll tell you what you do, Mother. Let her down easy, but do it so she'll stay down.
She won't. She'll bounce right up again.
You don't know Lily.
-I don't and I'm not going to.
-It won't hurt to meet her.
You can't just meet them.
She'll start acting on me.
-Well, let her play a scene for you.
-Not a scene, not a line...
-...not a word, not a syllable!
-All right, but you'll be sorry.
-Lily, dear.
-It's all right.
You don't have to let me down easy.
I heard.
-I'm sorry.
-He is pigheaded, isn't he?
-Yes.
-Do you mind if I take the box?
-It's the only one we've got.
-Of course.
All right.
Lily. You know,
I'm getting used to the hat.
-It does rather grow on one, doesn't it?
-Oh, yes. I think it's beautiful. I love it.
-It looks lovely on you.
-Thank you.
-Well, goodbye.
-Goodbye.
She sees Stefan, she screams.
That's it. That's it.
Mother! Mother!
-Yes?
-Oh, where is that thing? Where is it?
Mother!
-Where is it? Where is it?
-Where is what?
The play! The play!
It's my only copy with the notes in it.
-It's gone!
-It can't be gone.
-It's gone. I've got to find it! I've got to.
-It won't do any good repeating yourself.
I didn't leave it on the plane.
I didn't leave it in the car.
I'll search the house.
Hello? Yes, this is John Thornway.
Oh, you found it. Where, whe--
In an ash can?
Want it? Of course I want it!
Will you bring it right--?
Will you--? Oh, you can't.
Yes, yes, sure I'll come, but wait a moment.
What's your address?
-Hey. Are you John Thornway?
-Yeah.
-The guy who produces all those shows?
-That's right.
How do you do?
-How do you do? I'm--
-I know who you are.
-Do you know who I am?
-No.
Oh, come right in, please.
I'm in rather a hurry.
Yes, if you'll just come and sit down, please.
Oh, don't sit there.
Sit here, please.
Please.
Ladies and gentlemen
You've heard of Sarah Bernhardt
She really was a dilly
But Sarah Bernhardt couldn't compare
To the gal who's known as Lily
You've heard of Eleanor Duse
Her drama knocked them silly
But Duse was an amateur
Compared to a gal like Lily
On your mark
Get set
For here comes Lily!
Yet, here's a spot.
Out, damned spot. Out, I say!
One...
...two...
Who would have thought that the old man had so much blood in him?
Fie, Macbeth!
Fie!
A soldier, and afraid?
What, will these hands never be clean?
But no more of that, my Lord, no more of that.
Oh, no, no, no.
All the perfumes in Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.
Look not so pale, Macbeth.
Come, man, put on your nightgown and come to bed.
To bed.
To bed!
There's a knocking at the gate.
Come, give me your hand.
What is done cannot be undone.
Come.
To bed. To bed. To bed!
How was I, Mr. Thornway?
-Awful.
-Well, what did I do wrong?
Everything.
And now, Miss Mars, will you please give me back my play.
But I did it exactly as I was told.
You mean somebody told you to do it that way?
Yes. Professor Eggleston, in school.
Miss Mars, I'm going to talk to you for one minute...
...quietly but firmly.
I shouldn't, but you're a friend of my mothers and you come from my town.
And your father brought me into the world.
That is not one of the qualifications,
Miss Mars, for success on the stage.
I am going to give you no encouragement whatsoever.
But what I want is a job.
Miss Mars, I give an actress a job for only one reason...
...and that is that she is the best
I can get for the part.
Miss Mars, I have neither the wish, the time, nor the patience...
...to teach anybody how to act.
Lady Macbeth is walking in her sleep.
She is talking to herself, not to a boyfriend in the gallery.
She is a strong woman.
She has murdered a king so she can become a queen.
But her conscience has crept into her dreams and is gnawing at her mind.
Gnawing like a relentless rat.
Gnawing, gnawing.
And you play her as if she were a high school girl with a bellyache.
It is not:
"Come, man, put on your nightgown and come to bed."
It's:
"Come, man...
...put on your nightgown...
...and come to bed.
There's a knocking at the gate.
Come.
Give me your hand.
What's done cannot be undone."
Oh, bravo!
Bravo!
-Miss Mars, where's my play?
-You've been sitting on it.
That's yours too.
-Mr. Thornway?
-No!
It's not about me, it's about my brother.
-Does he act too?
-No, he collects doorknobs.
-Doorknobs.
-Yeah, and that was a superduper.
Oh, well, thank you.
Lily, can I blow out the candle?
-He'll be sorry.
-You bet he will.
Thanks for the knob.
Lily, don't feel bad.
I don't feel bad.
I just feel mad. Hopping mad.
Children, children, children.
What's all the fuss about?
We're being hopping mad,
Mama, for Lily.
Well, go be hopping mad in the dining room. Go on.
Well?
He didn't like me at all.
Perhaps he doesn't like Shakespeare. You should've done something more lowbrow...
...like Ten Nights in a Bar Room, or Why Girls Leave Home.
Or that sad scene from The Secret Bride.
Yes.
No coy little laugh, she just goes.
Yeah? Yeah?
-Excuse me, Mr. John, there's a lady here.
-Shoot her.
I think she's an actress.
Go away, you pest!
What's the matter, Johnny? Let me in!
Isobel. Angel!
Angel. Pest. Pest. Angel.
Make up your mind, Johnny.
Well, it's angel.
I thought you were somebody else.
-A girl?
-No, no, no, a pest.
Well, yes, a girl, but a pest.
-She's been hounding me.
-Johnny, what have you done?
Nothing, not a thing.
And you? I mean, recently?
Nothing but think of you, Johnny.
The lonely weeks on the road, in Buffalo,
Cleveland, Detroit, Cincinnati, Chicago.
Pittsburgh?
Yes, Pittsburgh.
What was that big pig-iron man doing?
Helping you think of me?
Well, I had to have a little fun. Innocent.
It's all right.
You have all the fun you like.
Just don't miss any more Saturday matinees.
In there you have no heart.
You have a box office. Goodbye.
-Now, now, where you going?
-Pittsburgh!
I don't have to work for you.
I can leave the stage and marry a man...
...with a million dollars worth of pig iron.
Then why don't you?
I don't like pig iron, Johnny.
I like you.
Oh, not bad, John, not bad.
But can't you put a little more oomph?
A little more crunch?
Oh, stop it, Owen.
Owen. Ow-- Owen-- Look...
...you can't shoot Irene in the first act.
-Second act?
-No, no.
Now, you've written a swell play.
Let it alone.
-When do we go into rehearsal?
-Next week.
All right, now, off with you.
I'll see you back here tonight. Mimi's tossing a high-class brawl for the troupe.
-Right now I got things to do.
-Oh, Johnny, I want to see your hometown.
And it wants to see you, darling, tonight, at your best.
So it would be a swell idea if you went on back to the hotel and took a nice long nap.
Come on, you too, Owen. Bye-bye.
-Goodbye, Johnny.
-Goodbye.
Now let's see.
-Irene enters down left--
-Listen to me. You must. You shall listen.
It's not for my sake, but for the sake of this poor, innocent child.
Why should she pay for our folly? See?
She has your eyes and your smile but not your name.
Papa! Papa! Papa!
Papa!
-Could be a racket, you know? It must be.
-Papa!
-That girl's lying.
-But that baby. She's the image of John.
-Papa!
-She does holler like him.
Please, I want nothing for myself, nothing!
Please. I beg you on bended knee.
Please! Please!
Now, that's enough.
This won't do you one bit of good.
When I say no, I mean no!
-Papa! Papa!
-Shut up!
Papa! Papa! Pa--
Now, go on away, please, and stop hounding me.
-But, Mr. Thornway--
-Go on, beat it, and take that grubby child.
If you'd just give me a fair chance--
Come here, come here.
Here are a couple of passes for the show.
Go down and see some acting but for heaven sakes don't do any more.
-Oh, thank you, Mr. Thornway.
-Thank you, Mr. Thornway.
-Got any bubble gum?
-Oh, she just loves bubble gum.
Do you know what I'm gonna do if I ever catch you anywhere near me again?
-No, Mr. Thornway.
-No, Mr. Thornway.
Now listen carefully, young lady.
-Yes, Mr. Thornway.
-Yes, Mr. Thornway.
I don't care where it is, or how many other people are there.
I'm gonna take you across my knee and spank the acting out of you.
Now go on. Beat it.
-Yes, Mr. Thornway.
-Yes, Mr. Thornway.
Go on, beat it!
Could it be the moon
Or the fiddler's tune
Played so dreamily?
Is it really love
Or the Gypsy in me?
Can you tell me why?
Tell me how can I
Solve this mystery?
Is it really love
Or the Gypsy in me?
Not so very long ago
A fortune teller told me
Someday he will come along
And in his arms
He'll hold me
Since we've been apart
I talked to my heart
Both of us agree
This is really love
Not the Gypsy in me
Strike your cymbal
Beat your drum
Hold back the dawn
And may tomorrow never come
Play Zigeuner, play till dawn
Play it faster till at last a rhapsody is born
I know how I fell
Underneath the spell of this melody
This is really love
Not the Gypsy
In
Me!
Supper is served. Supper is served.
Lily, let's go home.
Not yet.
Then let's go someplace and have a hamburger.
Boost. Boost.
Come on, Charlie. Boost.
Boost!
You must try coming in through the door sometime. It's so much simpler.
Yes, if you're invited.
You're Mr. Owen Vail, the man who writes such wonderful plays, aren't you?
Well, I'm Lily Mars. And you can do so much for me if you only will.
It's no good my talking to Mr. Thornway, he won't listen to me.
He will to you and if you spoke to him about--
Wait!
Why, it's-- It's the-- You're the girl that--
-What's the matter?
-Tell me this:
Has John Thornway never done anything for you?
-No, never.
-Well, what reason does he give?
He doesn't like me.
He doesn't like--
You wait right here.
But, Mr. Vail.
-Mr. Vail.
-Stay there.
You will speak to Mr. Thornway?
Don't you think it's time you called him John?
Has anyone seen Mr. Vail?
There you are, Mr. Vail,
I was looking for you.
Supper's served. Come on. Both of you.
There's only one of us.
I heard a girl's voice.
-No, that was me.
-You?
-Oh, yes. I often talk to myself.
-Soprano?
Sometimes.
Oh, it's me, Lily, Mrs. Thornway.
Why, Lily Mars.
-Come in, dear.
-Oh, no, I don't think I'd better.
Nonsense, we'd love to have you.
Oh, I don't think your son would.
-I guess he must have told you about--
-About that?
Don't let that worry you anymore.
Things like that don't upset John for very long.
Come on. Come in, Mr. Vail.
Don't upset him?
-Now make yourself perfectly at home.
-Thank you.
-Good evening, Lily.
-Good evening, Lily.
-Excuse me.
-Good evening, Professor Eggleston.
-My dear, Lily. Delighted to see you.
-Thank you.
How are the children?
Three of the--
Three of them had the mumps...
...but they're fine for now, thank goodness.
Excuse me.
-Did he say children?
-Well, yes.
Wait right here.
Miss Rekay, I saw your show, and your Gypsy number--
-Excuse me. Excuse me. Where's John?
-Where is John?
-That girl is here.
-Girl? What girl?
-What girl?
-You mean--? Did she bring--?
No. And it seems there's not just one.
There are:
-Three?
-At least. Maybe:
Four.
Well, can I play too?
-What is this, a new game?
-No. An old one.
John, you've simply got to do something about that girl.
-What girl?
-"What girl? " Lily Mars.
Has she been working on you too?
Don't pay any attention to her.
-You did.
-Not a great deal.
-I simply told her what I tell all the others.
-Others?
Yes. There's at least one in every town.
But why are you interested in this one?
-I've seen this one.
-And the child.
-One of them.
-This afternoon.
Outside your window.
Well, you low-minded snoopers. Of all--
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
She's one of those stage-struck kids...
...that thinks all she has to do to be an actress is make a wish.
I told her if she ever bothered me again, I-- I--
Excuse me.
John.
Oh, John. Just a moment.
Will you autograph my program?
Yes, I'd be delighted.
-Such beautiful music.
-Marvelous.
-For you.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
-Yes, thank you.
Thank you.
And hit the hit parade
It was growing pop
And it couldn't stop
Now it's number one
Thanks to Tom, the piper's son
Tom, Tom, the piper's son
He's stole a tune and away he run
And away run he
With that melody
Tom was hot, the tune was sweet
But he revamped it with a new offbeat
And the classic thing
Got a shot of swing
Mr. Brahms cried "Ach "
So did Mozart and Bach
And to hear them rave
Paganini tumbled over in his grave
And now that tune that no one played
Has stepped right up and hit the hit parade
It was growing pop
And it couldn't stop!
Now it's number one
Thanks to Tom, the piper's son
-Once more, please. By special request.
-It's all right with me. Keep singing.
Tom, Tom the piper's son
Stole a tune and away he run
And away run he
With that melody
Tom was hot, the tune was sweet
But he vamped it with a boogie beat
And the classic thing
Got a shot of swing
Beethoven turned gray
So did, did Debussy and Bizet
It was such a stew
Tschai-- Tschaikovsky said
"I'm gonna sue"
And now that tune that no one played
Has stepped right up
And hit the hit parade
It was growing pop
And it couldn't stop
Now it's number one
Thanks to Tom, the piper's son
I do hope Mr. Thornway will do something for Lily.
-Oh, I think he will.
-Good. Good.
I guess you were kind of surprised to see me pop up here tonight, weren't you?
I was. I shouldn't have been knowing what a talent you have for popping up.
But I didn't see you come in.
I didn't exactly come in.
You see, I came over the wall.
And just where did you...?
Right over there.
That's right where you going to:
But when I was singing, you looked so interested.
-I am not.
-So human.
I am not. Now, Miss Mars, this way out. Please.
Mr. Thornway, please take me to New York with you tomorrow.
I can do so much for Mama and the kids.
You might start by washing that grubby little sister.
Poppy is not grubby.
She was made-up for the part.
Miss Mars.
Very well. If you really want me to go.
I do, Miss Mars. I do very much.
All right, over I go.
But you're gonna have to boost me.
Come on, boost.
You're afraid of me.
-I'm what?
-You are.
Well, that's one thing
I didn't know till now.
There are a lot of things you don't know about yourself.
One of them is why you're making me go back over that wall.
Well, that is one thing I do know, young lady, it's to teach you a lesson.
Just like a naughty little girl.
I know why you treat me as a child...
...it's because you're afraid to think of me as a woman.
All right, boost.
One, two.
Goodbye.
I beg your pardon.
What's the matter, Lily?
-Nothing.
-Don't cry, Lily.
I hate him. I just hate him.
I hate him too.
Who does she hate?
Children. Children.
Now, now, now. It isn't as bad as all that no matter how bad it is.
Why are you crying?
Because Lily is.
Lily, why are you crying?
Mr. Thornway wouldn't give me a job...
...and he sneered at me...
...and he told me to go home and wash my grubby little sister.
Me?
And he made me climb back over the wall.
Well, Lily, dear, that's nothing for you to cry about.
Were you mean to him?
Did you sneer at him?
Did you call him grubby?
Did you make him climb a wall?
Well, then. Who should be ashamed?
-Him.
-Right. Who should be crying?
-Him.
-And if you shouldn't be crying...
...what should you be doing?
-Laughing.
-That's right.
Now then, off to bed all of you.
Come on, laugh yourselves to sleep. Scoot.
Mama, when I grow up can I be you?
I'll try and arrange it.
Now scoot.
Lily, you're something that's very wonderful to be.
-What, Mama?
-Nineteen.
Nineteen and nowhere.
Some very successful people didn't get their start until well past 20.
Right now it looks like I'm gonna be well past everything...
...before I get my chance to do what I've always dreamed of doing.
Being an actress, and a good one too.
I could give you and the kids all the things you want.
I've got what I want.
What you want's in New York, isn't it?
And you're in Indiana.
Well, if you want to get what you want, you've got to go where it is, don't you?
Well, then.
Davey? Davey!
Yes, Mama?
Get George and bring him here to me.
-I'm not gonna let--
-You will too.
-Let's have no fiddle-de-dee about this.
-But, Mama, I can't--
Here. I got it. I was sound asleep.
-Here's George, Mama.
-Thank you, Davey. Now run along.
-Good night.
-Good night, dear.
Now you're going to take this and go to New York.
It's only $28.
-But I just can't--
-Who's Mama around here?
Good night, dear.
Davey?
Davey?
I want you to put this money in George, but don't let Mama see you do it.
Can't you put the money in George?
I won't be here.
Oh, not now, dear.
You can do it tomorrow.
All right, girls. Places for the finale.
-Excuse me, but--
-Excuse me, but...
Where did you get that hat?
It's a copy. I made it myself.
Ninety-eight cents.
-Can I go in with you?
-Are you in the show?
No, not yet.
I just got to New York today, but--
Sorry, honey, but Thorny has a strict rule against visitors.
Well, come on. Snap your shirttails.
What is this?
-What's cooking, Mike?
-Hi, Mike, what do you know?
-Hi, Mike. What do you know?
-Everybody but you.
Oh, well, it's perfectly all right.
You see, I know Mister--
I know Thorny.
Do you, now?
-His father brought me into the world.
-Did he, now?
Well, if you bother the son during rehearsal, he'll do just the opposite for you.
-Well, thank you anyway.
-Young lady...
...if you wanna see Mr. Thornway, why don't you send your name in to him?
Because I wanna see him.
Lady, that does not make sense.
It does to me.
You see, we had kind of a misunderstanding.
He doesn't know I'm here.
So why don't you let me go right on in and surprise him--?
I'm sorry, lady. You can't surprise
Mr. Thornway. Only by appointment.
Now, get off with you now.
Well.
-Here?
-That's right.
Darling, I want you to always wear that hat to rehearsal.
-Everything goes well when you do.
-Certainly. It's my lucky hat.
Excuse me.
But could you tell me where Mr. Tho--
So you wiggled in, did you?
Wiggle out now, wiggle out now, or I'll--
-Mike!
-Miss Rekay.
I thought you were, but you weren't, were you?
Excuse me, I apologize.
I beg your pardon.
I'm-- I'm sorry. I--
What's the matter with Mike?
I'm afraid he's been drinking.
Shouldn't do that.
That sets a bad example.
Come on, let's follow it.
All right, girls.
Come on, line up for the last number.
Owen, coming with us?
-Nope.
-For a drink?
Yeah!
Mister--?
Come on, this is a Russian number, girls.
Move. Move.
At the Club Tovaritch
There is romance in the air
Love is everywhere!
When you hear the balalaika
You had best beware
Everyone is there!
Say. Say! Wake up! Wake up!
What happened? Get locked in?
Yes, ma'am...
...but I wanted to be.
Sorry, but there's no sleeping permitted in this theatre.
-But I haven't got any place to--
-Out. Out.
All right.
I'll find some other way to see Mr. Thornway.
-Well, goodbye.
-Say, wait a minute.
Is it about a job?
Where you from?
-Indiana.
-How old?
-Nineteen.
-I'm from Nebraska. I was 16.
There's a boy back home who wants to marry you.
The one who wanted to marry me was a fine young fella.
The kind who was sure to get ahead.
Yeah, that's Charlie.
That was Sam. And he did all right too.
Now he's the big man out that way.
Everybody said I was an awful fool not to stay home and marry Sam.
But there was something I wanted more than him, or anybody or anything.
And that was to go on the stage.
Well, where am I?
Gee.
And you've been trying since you were 16?
Bless your heart, child,
I didn't start with a broom.
First I carried a spear.
Then the third year I got a line to speak:
"Madame, dinner is served."
Oh, then there were a lot of years, and a lot of shows.
And a husband or two.
And then there was a song that got to be my song.
That was all before your time.
-What's your name?
-Lily Mars.
Lily, know what you are?
Foolish?
You're me. The same eager, hopeful, stage-struck little hick...
...I was half a century ago, with the same question to answer.
What do you want?
I wanna be an actress.
Know what I'd do if I were you?
Go home?
Lily, I think you are home.
I know I am, and I'd rather be here...
...even doing what I'm doing, than be anywhere else on earth.
Because...
...this is where I belong.
Every little movement
Has a meaning of its own
Every thought and feeling
By some posture can be shown
And every love thought
That comes a-stealing
O'er your being
Must be revealing
All its sweetness
In some appealing little gesture
All of its own
Every little movement
Has a meaning of its own
Every thought and feeling
By some posture can be shown
And every love thought
That comes a-stealing
O'er your being
Must be revealing
All its sweetness
In some appealing little gesture
All of its own
All right, dear, come on, run through it once with me now.
Now watch this, Gene.
Hit it, Colly.
What is this throbbing within me?
What is this rhythm so new?
What is this beating
That keeps on repeating
I love you?
I love
You, my dear
Don't you know it's you?
When I look at you
I hear lovely music
Can it be my heart that sings?
When I look at you
I look at an angel
Tell me where you've parked your wings
Dizzy me
Silly moon
Crazy quilt of a sky
Are you real or a dream
That got caught in my eye
My dearest
When I look at you
I'm looking at rainbows
Stars come tumbling down from above
And I'm in love with you
My
Love!
Places for the Russian number.
Come on, shake your shirttails.
Get going.
There should be a stampede around here. Come on, move.
There you are!
At the Club Tovaritch
There is romance in the air
Love is everywhere!
When you hear the balalaika
You had best beware
Everyone is there!
There is Toscha, Sascha, Mischa, Grischa,
Rimsky, Pimsky, Anton, Danton
Georgevitch, Oh, Porgevitch
Oh, Niegin, Iliavitch
Tomazoffsky, Borisloffsky
Woizikeffsky, Igoreffsky
Feodoroff, Anniloroff
Will be at the Club Tovaritch
Hi!
-You. Come here.
-Hello.
Mr. Thornway, I'm sorry. I--
-Keep the change.
-Thank you, Mr. Thornway.
Thank you very much for the lunch.
It was the best I ever had and the biggest.
-That long train ride gave you an appetite.
-Train?
And spending all night in a theater isn't nourishing.
I guess not.
-Aren't they--?
-Miss Mars...
...let's get something settled once and for all.
I'm letting you stay in the show only because:
You knew my father.
You know my mother.
You come from my hometown.
You're in New York in need of a job.
Well, I needed a few more girls in the show anyway.
I wish there was some way
I could show my appreciation.
-There is. Just do your job.
-Oh, I will.
Now, some of the girls live in a boarding house...
...they've affectionately dubbed the
"Incubator". It's reasonable, respectable.
But where you live or what you do outside of the theater...
...is strictly your own affair.
Miss Mars, you understand, don't you?
Absolutely. You want me to live in an incubator and not to bother you.
Yes, yeah, that's the gist of it.
So starting right now, you're strictly on your own.
I wash my hands of any responsibility for you.
All right.
And, Miss Mars...
...there's one thing that I must ask you not to do around the theater.
-What's that?
-Don't wear that hat.
Well, Mr. Thornway, it's--
It's the only one I've got.
Yes, yes.
Well, here we are. This is it.
This is the "Incubator".
A lot of fine young actresses come out of here.
Of course they have to go in first.
Well, thanks again for the hat.
You know it didn't have to be a boughten.
-A boughten? What's a boughten?
-Oh, that's what Poppy calls a store hat.
You know, one you don't make yourself.
It's boughten. I always make my own.
Yes, I know.
-Good afternoon. Have you any rooms?
-No, sir.
-Not even a small one?
-I'm sorry. We do not take mixed couples.
We take only ladies.
Well, will you take this one?
-Yes, certainly.
-Well, that's fine.
-I have to be getting on back to the theater.
-All right.
Do you want me to come with you?
No. No. You be at rehearsal tomorrow morning at 9. Sharp.
-Goodbye, Miss Mars.
-Goodbye. And thank you very much.
Oh, Lily, for your brother.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Tho--
John.
-Hi, Mike.
-Hello, Mr. Thornway.
-What do you--
-I--
-Rosebud?
-Yes, sir?
-Is that Miss Rekay's?
-Yes, sir. She gave it to me.
-Where is she?
-She's in her dressing room.
Waiting for you. I'll tell her you here.
-But, Isobel, it was written for you.
-I will not play it as it is.
-But Isobel--
-He's here.
Rosebud, I told you to throw that hat away.
-So you know more than I do?
-Who doesn't?
-All right, then. Why don't you write a play?
-Why don't you?
Now, what goes on here?
Our star has decided she doesn't like the third act.
I hate it. It doesn't march along.
It dribbles.
Now, let's sit down and we'll talk about it. Quietly.
Are you sure you have the time?
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late, dear, but I had to have lunch.
What did you two eat, an elephant?
And then after lunch I had things to do.
Business.
Hello?
John. For you.
A lady.
-Me?
-Yes, you.
Hello?
Oh, hello, dear.
Well, it's nice to hear your voice.
It's my mother.
Yes, yes, she's here.
No, I mean, she's not here.
She's here in the incubator.
-Incubator?
-Yeah, it's a sort of a club.
A young folks home.
-John, will you give her a job?
-Well, I've already given her one.
Hello. Tell her Mama and the children send love.
I'm Mama.
Tell her I know I don't need to worry, but I will.
Well, you needn't, Mrs. Mars.
I'll be just like a father to her.
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
It's respectable. It's painfully respectable.
Hold on.
John, you will keep an eye on her?
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Now, look dear...
...I have to say goodbye now because some people are waiting.
Goodbye, dear.
Well, after all my father did bring her into the world.
Now about that third act.
What seems to be wrong with it?
Everything.
Brighter dialogue, stronger scenes.
Such as?
Such as you are going to write. Goodbye.
Well?
Well, what?
You got any ideas about the third act?
No. Have you?
No. I was thinking about women too.
What has Miss Mars got to do with this?
John, I wish I had as much money as you don't know about women.
Look, if you were sore at me. You'd punch me right in the nose, wouldn't you?
-With pleasure.
-Yeah. All right.
If Isobel were squawking about one scene...
...I might think she was sincere, but no, she doesn't like the whole act.
"It doesn't march along. It dribbles."
Yeah, and if you keep on being so chummy with that babe from the woods--
I am not chummy with Miss Mars.
Isobel's imagining things.
John about such things, women do not imagine, they know.
I don't know how they know, but they know.
Catch that, will you?
-Hello?
-Miss Lily Mars is here to see Mr. Thornway.
-Shall I send her up?
-Why, yes.
Yes, certainly. Right away.
-It's-- It's your laundry.
-How could it be?
-I didn't send out any laundry.
-You do your own?
Oh, come on now.
Come on, let's get to work.
Well, here's how it goes.
"Stefan enters." I'm Stefan.
-"Nadina is singing." You're Nadina.
-Me?
Now you can't go on with the gay song, so you break.
Oh, I'm a Gypsy
I'm--
Come in, come in.
"Who is she? Who is she? "
"Please, believe me.
There is no other woman, darling."
Just leave it in the hall out there.
"You mustn't cry."
"Why are you here?
Go away, leave me alone."
-"No."
-"What do you want? "
"First, I want to tell you that you're beautiful.
And then I want to take you in my arms."
"Oh, Stefan."
-All right, now stop your kidding, Owen.
-Who's kidding?
"Oh, Stefan."
Excuse me. Here's my laundry.
-Good evening, Miss Mars.
-Good evening.
-And good night.
-I wanted to--
I'm terribly sorry, we're very busy...
...it's time all young actresses should be in bed.
I was in bed, but I couldn't sleep.
I just tossed and tossed.
Whenever I'm worried,
I toss and toss.
Well, that's very interesting.
What's worrying you?
-Our show.
-Now she doesn't like it.
I like it. I love it.
I think it's a wonderful play. Really I do.
-But may I say something?
-I know of no way of stopping you.
Well, I think we need a new finish.
Isobel doesn't like the third act,
Miss Mars doesn't like the finish.
Tell me, Miss Mars, what's wrong with it?
-Well, to me it just fizzles out.
-Fizzles?
-Just fizzles--
-Stop fizzling!
Well, now listen. Here's the way it goes.
Stefan says,
"l wanna take you in my arms."
Nadina, "I want you to dearest.
I've been away for years, and I never wanna leave again."
"As Nadina and Stefan gaze tenderly into each other's eyes, curtain." Not natural.
If I were in love and all they did was gaze tenderly into my eyes I'd have another fight.
-Well, Miss Mars, what would you do?
-Well, look, I'll show you.
Now, you're Stefan.
Go on, say your line.
And then I want to take you in my arms.
And I want you to, dearest.
I've been away from them for a million years...
...and I never wanna leave them again.
Curtain.
Here's where I think we really helped it.
You follow the chambermaid up the stairs.
Say goodnight. You go into your room.
She has her line. Curtain.
-I love it.
-Yeah, that's great, John.
-That takes care of all my objections.
-Fine.
-Now let's try it, shall we?
-From where?
The two of you are looking at each other and the chambermaid enters.
-Oh, yes.
-All right. Chambermaid.
Your Excellencies, your rooms are ready now.
May I show you to them?
Come on down and answer the phone.
Lily, you're wanted on the telephone.
Oh, it's Thorny again tonight?
Oh, dear. Dear, dear.
-Hello?
-I'm just leaving the apartment...
...and I'll be right over to pick you up. Goodbye.
Goodbye!
Yeah?
She is? Well, tell her I've gone.
Tell her I've--
She's already on her way up?
Oh, that's bad. All right.
Well, thanks. Thanks.
Hello, darling. Well, I was just taking a cold shower to wake me up.
You mustn't touch me.
You'll get all wet.
-I've got to work all night.
-So you told me.
But, John, take tonight off.
Let's go out somewhere.
Now, angel, you mustn't tempt me.
Work is work.
But you haven't taken me anywhere in two whole weeks.
Yes, I know, but tonight is not the night.
No, I simply can't go out with you tonight.
That's all.
Then I'll come in.
Isobel, you must be worn out from that rehearsal today, aren't you?
-Oh, no.
-No?
Just look at all this work I've got to do.
Poor boy.
Oh, don't touch anything.
You'll get everything mixed up.
-Remember the first time I sang for you?
-Yes, of course I do.
That's one night I'll always remember.
So shall I, John.
-Look, Isobel, darling, I've just got to work.
-Wait, wait, wait.
When I look at you
I hear lovely music
Can
There is something wrong with this piano.
I'll fix it.
Can it be my heart that sings?
Well, good night now.
It's awful. It's terrible.
-What?
-The piano, it needs tuning.
Now, darling, you run home and take a nice long rest.
I certainly wish I could.
If you won't change your mind, so I better go home.
Well, I'm sorry. But you know with the show opening in a week and everything...
...I'm so busy that I--
Well, you know how busy I am.
Yes, I know.
You're so busy...
...you take your shower with your tie, shirt, coat and pants on.
Think about a cowboy
When you think of yippee-yee
Think of English crumpets
When you think of havin ' tea
Think of silver moonlight
And how lovely it can be
But when you think of lovin '
Baby, think of me
Think of snowcapped mountains
When you think you'd like to ski
Think of Cuba-libres
When you think you'd like a spree
Think about the movies
For a set of dishes free
But when you think of lovin '
Baby, think of me
Good evening, Mr. Thornway.
Table 53, please.
-This way, please.
-Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I see a celebrity among our customers.
It's the ace of the racetrack, the year's leading jockey, Dixie Bray.
What are you gonna do to entertain the folks?
Nothing. All I can do is ride.
Well, next time
I think you'd better bring your horse.
Here's a man who has presented many actors, so for a change...
...I'm gonna present him,
John Thornway.
-How are you, Bob?
-Fine, John.
-Say, who's the lady I see you with?
-Oh, I'm Lily Mars.
-Yeah? What do you do?
-I'm a chambermaid.
-In what hotel?
-Not in any hotel.
In John Thornway's new show,
Let Me Dream.
What do you do in the show?
Do you make beds for the audience?
Oh, I should say not. They're not gonna fall asleep during our show.
Well, what are you gonna do to wake us up?
Well, I-- I can sing a little.
-Come on, sister, you're on.
-Is it all right?
Go right on.
Excuse me, I'll telephone John.
Maybe he'll come here and join us.
-But, darling, he's probably fast asleep.
-He'd better be.
When I look at you
I hear lovely music
Can it be my heart that sings?
When I look at you
I look at an angel
Tell me where you've parked your wings
Dizzy me
Silly moon
Crazy quilt of a sky
Are you real or a dream
That got caught in my eye?
When I look at you
I'm looking at rainbows
Stars come tumbling down from above
And I'm in love with you
My love
He doesn't answer.
Oh, well, John's a very sound sleeper.
We're going to another club.
New place, just opened.
Oh, no, I want to stay here.
But you won't like it here.
You won't like it at all.
You're not gonna be a chambermaid very long.
-Let's try another and swing it a bit.
-All right.
Besides that, we can't get a table.
I can't get a table?
-You hear?
-Yes.
Well, if they want me to sing for my supper. Come on.
What is this throbbing within me?
What is this rhythm so new?
What is this beating
That keeps on repeating
And what am I dreaming
That I wake up screaming
I love you?
I love you
I love you
I love you
John, I--
When I look at you
I hear lovely music
Can it be my heart that sings?
When I look at you
I look at an angel
Tell me where you parked your wings
I mean, your wings
I mean, your wings
I mean, your ever-loving, turtle-doving wings, Jack
Dizzy me
Silly moon
Crazy quilt
Of a lackadaisy, crazy quilt of a sky
Are you real as your seemin '
Or a dream that I'm dreamin '?
Or are you just a sty
That got caught in my eye?
Just a sty in my eye
When I look at you
I see a rainbow
The sun, the moon
The stars in June
Come tumbling down from above
And I might as well face it
I'm in love!
Was I all right? Did you--?
Miss Rekay.
I'm sorry, but, but--
-But--
-But, but what?
-I didn't know you were here.
-Well, I wasn't.
But as luck would have it I happened to drop in just in time to catch your act.
Clever, very clever. Isn't she, John?
Well, there I was and he said do something.
-I didn't know what to do.
-So you imitated me.
Well, Miss Rekay, any time you want to, you can imitate me.
Oh, thank you.
That's very kind of you, Miss Mars.
And I'll never sing your song again,
I promise. Honest.
Neither shall I. Honest.
Isobel, do you care for a drink or anything?
No, I don't care for a drink or anything.
I'm sorry to break up this party.
But I'm getting tired, John, very tired.
I think I'd better be taken home right now.
-Come on, Owen.
-Isobel, I've called a rehearsal...
...for 9 in the morning.
You come in whenever you like.
I'll do that, John. Good night.
Oh, now look what I've done.
She's mad, John, good and mad.
Come on, let's dance.
-It's exactly 5:00 p.m.
-All right, so what, time signal?
All this waiting, waiting, waiting.
And for what?
For a woman to make up her mind.
From me they get 10 minutes, tops.
Stop your worrying.
Rekay'll be back.
She's always getting hoity-toity and flouncing out.
But this time she means it.
It'll take a little high-powered coaxing and petting.
-John knows how to handle her.
-Hope he hasn't lost his touch.
All right, Scotty, you can tell them they can all go home.
Everybody.
Everybody, that's all for today.
What time tomorrow?
I'll let you know tomorrow, that's all.
Is there anything I can do, John?
Yeah, Scotty, you can go out and get drunk. For me.
Anything I can do, John?
Well, you can help Scotty.
-Anything I can do?
-Hey.
Yeah, you help the two of them.
That'll be all for today.
John?
Hi there.
Hello.
I'm going home.
Back home. Tonight.
No. No, you're not.
But if I go away everything will be all right with the show...
...and everything.
I'm calling off the show.
Oh, no, you mustn't.
I'm not gonna do it unless I can do it right.
But, John, I've been thinking that maybe I--
I know what you've been thinking.
I believe I could do it.
What do you think?
I think that...
...I'm in love with you.
Oh, John, I--
You run along now...
...and I'll let you know what I'm gonna do just as soon as I know myself.
All right.
Love.
I hate love.
Women? You can have them.
Thanks, I got some.
Good night, fellow comedians.
I'm going home to my wife...
...the one in Brooklyn.
I shall walk all the way, and I hope,
I hope it's raining.
And when I'll get home, if my supper isn't ready, I shall beat her.
And if my supper is ready,
I shall not eat it.
Farewell.
There's a guy that gets drunk and has the D.T.'s all at the same time.
Well?
The show opens as planned, one week from tonight.
-With Rekay?
-Without Rekay.
Right. Now here's what I'm gonna do.
Don't. She's clever but she's not nearly ready to step into a big part.
It'll take years before she's ready to carry a Broadway show.
Just the same,
I'm gonna take a chance.
Wait. We're the ones that have been drinking.
Think it over, John.
It's an awful big gamble.
What's show business?
Lily. Lily, telephone. Lily, telephone.
It's Thorny.
Hello?
Yes, John.
Yes, John.
Oh, yes, John.
What's happened?
-Where are you going?
-Hey, Lily, wait.
-Where you going?
-To the theater.
-Like that?
-What?
-Mama! Mama!
-What is it? What happened?
Hello, operator, get me long distance.
Yes.
Oh, Lily.
Oh, I'm so tickled that I'm tickled.
Oh, bless your heart child. Well, it's only what I expected sooner or later.
Good night, dear. Lily, be sure to eat plenty of fresh vegetables. Goodbye.
Hello, operator?
Get me the Midhaven Daily Press.
Children, guess what? Lily is a star.
-Will she twinkle?
-She'll twinkle.
Midhaven Daily Press? I have a very important piece of news for you.
Tell him about it, Mama!
Tell him about Lily!
Children, stop it. Be quiet. Be quiet.
Not you.
My name is Lily Mars' mother.
Guess what?
A little more wine?
"No more champagne, Stefan.
More kisses."
-No.
-No?
No, Lily. No.
Look, darling, try to remember you're a mature Russian princess.
-On your honeymoon.
-Yes.
Not a village belle on a hayride.
That's all right, darling.
Come on now. Let's try it again.
-All right.
-From your entrance.
You're doing fine, honey. Keep it up.
Don't get excited. Don't get excited now.
-All right.
-All right.
Oh, Stefan, how could you do this to me, and on our honeymoon?
No, no, no. You're not suffering enough.
-She's wiggling enough.
-Go on, go on. Suffer.
Suffer. Oh, Stefan, how could you do this to-- Ouch!
And on our honeymoon.
-Now, darling, you know what I want.
-Yes.
-You're sure?
-Yes.
That's fine.
Okay, Beethoven, hit it.
I heard a tune in the moonlight
From the distance arising
Troika bells harmonizing
A Russian rhapsody
Hold it! Hold it!
-Will you send this out for me, Mike?
-Sure will, Syd.
Say, how'd it go?
Well, it's a good sign when the dress rehearsal smells.
How was the Mars kid?
It's a good sign when the dress rehearsal smells.
Attababy, baby.
-I was all right, wasn't I?
-Oh, sure. Sure you were.
And you're gonna be all righter too.
Now relax, huh?
All right.
Here.
Thank you.
"When John Thornway's new play, Let Me
Dream, opens in New York Friday night...
...the star will be none other than Lily Mars, daughter of Mrs. Flora Mars of Midhaven."
I can't believe it.
Oh, I'm in heaven.
Ouch. All except my feet.
Frankie, I wonder why John didn't come back to see me?
Well-- Well, he never does.
Once the show starts off in dress rehearsal, he just stays out front and lets it roll.
I made some mistakes, but not very big ones.
Oh, well, sure. Everybody makes mistakes.
Now relax and save your strength.
You gotta go out there tomorrow night and murder a lot of people.
Relax.
Oh, hello, Mr. T.
-Is she decent?
-Yeah, sure, come on in.
-Will you go and tell Scotty not to leave?
-Yeah, sure.
-Hello.
-Hi there.
How was I?
First.
Lily, you've learned more in a few weeks than most actresses learn in a lifetime.
With a little luck and a lot of hard work, you're gonna be a great actress, someday.
Now, I've called another dress rehearsal for tonight.
We'll start just as soon as the cast has had a little rest and got something to eat.
All right, boss. I'm ready.
No, Lily.
I hate worse than anything in the world to tell you, but no, you're not ready.
I should have had more sense than to let you tackle such a tough part...
...but I wasn't being sensible and now I've got to be.
And so have you.
Am I hopeless?
No, darling, no, you're not hopeless.
It's just that you're green.
You're inexperienced.
Lily, it's a tremendous job for an actress to carry a whole show.
She has to have authority.
She has to have range and ease.
And a thousand and one tricks of the trade that you can only learn through experience.
She has to be a finished actress.
A big actress.
And I'm only a little one.
You're a good little one.
But this part calls for a good big one.
And I've got her.
You made up with Isobel.
It wasn't a question of making up, it was business.
Show business between two professional show people...
...who understand that their job's are more important than their personal feelings.
Darling you and--
-Miss Rekay wants me to put these--
-Just a minute, please.
She can move in now.
Lily, take all the time you want to.
She shouldn't have barged in here like that.
Darling, I--
I can't tell you how rotten I feel about that but--
-Hey, boss.
-I'll be with you in just a minute, Scotty.
But here's how it's got to be:
Isobel plays the princess and you play the--
Your old part.
Rekay called. She wants this room or she's gonna take another powder on you.
Well, she'll just have to wait.
Lily.
Lily.
I don't want you to go but you can if you want to.
You can go away, you can go back home, you can hate me for the rest of your life.
But there's something else you can do if you want to.
You can come back tomorrow night...
...and try to play that maid better than any maid has ever been played in any theater.
When you walk out on stage and say your few lines...
...and give them everything you've got to give...
...there'll be one less amateur in the world...
...and one more professional.
Now, that's all up to you.
Here she is.
Surprise! Surprise!
Surprise! Surprise!
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations, Lily.
-I'm so happy.
-We'll all move to New York.
-I'll get a lot of superduper doorknobs.
-Wonderful. You're wonderful.
-We just had to come.
-So we came.
-In a bus.
-We sold the piano.
Oh, well, I'm certainly glad to see you.
Oh, you're tired, dear.
Come and sit over here.
Right here in this big chair.
You look just the same.
-Well, where's Poppy?
-Poppy?
Oh, Poppy.
Children, did we come away without Poppy?
No, Mama.
-Did we leave her on the bus?
-No, Mama.
Well, then, she must be here.
Yes, Mama. Poppy! Poppy! Poppy!
Congratulations, Lily, dear
Upon the start of your career
We love you best of all the stars
We're proud of you, Miss Lily Mars
That's nice, dear. She loved it.
I ' m not a star. I ' m not even an actress.
I'm nothing at all.
Oh, there, there, dear.
Now no matter how bad it is, it isn't as bad as all that.
I wanna go home.
Oh, there, there, darling.
Look at him. He's got the biggest moneymaker he ever had in his life.
And what is he doing? Moping.
-John, how about Lily? Is she here?
-I don't know.
What about her part?
Well, if she isn't here to play it, the other girl will.
I heard a tune in the moonlight
From the distance arising
Troika bells harmonizing
A Russian rhapsody
Where roses bloom in September
Where autumn leaves are swaying
To balalaikas playing
John, how soon is Lily supposed to make her entrance?
Right after Isobel's song.
Where?
Through that door over there.
Pick a rose in September
When it's spring you'll remember
A Russian rhapsody
When it's spring you'll remember
A Russian rhapsody
-Stefan.
-Waiters.
No more champagne, Stefan.
More kisses.
Your excellencies, your room is ready.
May I show you to it now?
Children, quiet. Quiet.
-Good night, Your Excellencies.
-Good night.
And may your dreams be beautiful.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
-I'm so glad, dear.
-I knew she'd come back. I'll see you later.
Isobel, darling, you were swell.
Thanks for coming back and I'm very happy about everything.
You should be, John. I am too.
Now run along and see Lily.
And tell her for me she's a real trouper.
And you're very lucky.
Swell, kid. You were swell. You were swell.
Oh, and you were swell. Swell.
Hello.
Swell. You were sw--
Oh, Scotty, listen, thanks a million.
It was swell.
Leo, costumes swell, swell.
You were swell.
You-- Oh, I beg your pardon.
I thought he was in the--
-This should be good for two years.
-Yes. Listen, where is Lily dress--
Lily's dressing--
Oh, it's all right. Never mind.
You were swell, Scotty.
-She just left.
-Oh, well, thanks. You were swell, Prissy.
Thank you.
Lily. Lily.
-Hi there.
-Hello.
Thanks for coming back.
I never enjoyed any actress's performance so much in my life.
Oh, John, I was only on the stage for a minute.
It was the happiest, the most thrilling moment...
...I ever hope to have in the theater.
It made me sure that I was right about you.
John, we've got an audience.
Well, you just wait until you see the audiences you're going to have.
You've heard of Sarah Bernhardt
She really was a dilly
But Sarah Bernhardt couldn't compare
To the gal that's known as Lily
Where there's music
There'll be singing
Where there's singing
You'll find skies of blue
For when all the world goes wrong
A simple little song
Will always bring a rainbow
Smiling through
With a rainbow
There'll be laughter
Chasing after sunshine from above
Where there's sunshine
There'll be music
And where there's music
There's love
Hey, mister, that's my sister.
She's marriaged.
-Poppy, be quiet.
-Yes, Poppy, you'd better...
...or you'll get put out.
Not with my mother-in-law here.
For songs are souvenirs
That live through the years
The grand old songs never die
Where there's music
There'll be dancing
No matter where you go
It's 3:00 in the morning
We've danced the whole night through
That melody, so entrancing
Seems to be made for us two
I could just keep right on dancing
Forever dear with you
Where there's music
There'll be dancing
And romancing
To the rhythm that is new
Gotta dance
Gotta dance
Broadway rhythm
It's got me
Everybody dance
Broadway rhythm
It's got me
-Everybody dance
-Broadway rhythm it's got me
On the gay white way
-In each merry café
-Orchestras play
-Taking your breath away with that
-Broadway rhythm it's got me
Everybody sing and dance
That Broadway rhythm
That Broadway rhythm
When I hear that happy beat
Feel like dancing down the street
That Broadway rhythm
It's got me beating
Broadway rhythm
It's got me
Broadway rhythm
It's got me
It's the sweetest beat
From the sweetest street
-Known as Broadway
-The street of a million dreams
-Broadway
-Where nothing is what it seems
Broadway rhythm's got me
And where there's rhythm
There's music and love
Thank you. Some place where we can talk?
This way.
She never attempted suicide before?
No, never.
I see.
What is her occupation?
She's a well known concert pianist.
I've heard her play several times.
She does not speak at all.
If you question her... she doesn't answer.
One would think she didn't hear one, if one didn't know that she does.
She will talk to me. I should like to examine her again tomorrow under hypnosis.
Rather, if she's not cooperating, under narcosis.
And you really think that will help?
It may do. At least it'll tell us the nature of the injury to her mind.
I know you fellows get some remarkable results but I can't say I altogether like it.
It seems a little like prying if you see what I mean.
Dr. Kendall...
A surgeon doesn't operate without first taking off the patient's clothes.
And nor do we with the mind.
You know what Staple says: the human mind is like Salome at the beginning of her dance.
Hidden from the outside world by seven veils, veils of reserve, shyness, fear, they're with friends.
The average person will drop first one veil, then another, maybe three or four altogether.
With a lover, she wild take off five, or even six, but never the seventh.
Now, you see, the human mind likes to cover its nakedness, too and keep its private thoughts to itself.
Salome dropped  her seventh veil of her free will but you will never get the human mind to do that.
And that is why I use narcosis.
Five minutes under narcosis and down comes the seventh veil.
Then we can see what is actually going on behind it.
Then we can really help.
I'll be back tomorrow at 3 o'clock.
You'll have the patient ready, please.
Goodbye, Dr. Kendall.
Good bye.
Good afternoon, nurse.
Good afternoon, Doctor.
Well, how is the patient today?
Just the same, Doctor.
I would like you to prepare an injection.
It's just to put her to sleep the first time.
Later on when she is cooperating she'll be able to get along without it.
I shall start as soon as you are ready.
Good afternoon, Miss Cunningham.
My name is Larsen. I trust you slept well?
Oh, you didn't.
That is a pity, a great pity.
When one doesn't sleep, one isn't very happy.
Well,  never mind,  never mind.
You shall get a little sleep now.
I want you to breathe deeply.
Now we'll have a little sleep.
You're very tired and you'd like to go to sleep.
Relax now... that's right.
Relax and close your eyes, gently, very slowly....
You're so tired, so terribly tired.
So lazy, and you want to go to sleep.
It's so nice to relax. It's so nice to go to sleep.
That's right, soon you will be asleep....
There, you are asleep.
Nothing can hurt you now because you're asleep.
You understand, don't you?
Nod your head if you do.
That's right.
Now, you can do what you like and you can go where you please.
What would you like to do?
Where would you like to go? Hm?
Would you like to go back to school?
You were happy when you are little girl, weren't you?
Would you like to go back and be happy again?
Back to school?
School.
Yes?
School.
Yes, tell me about it.
School.
Listen, you are 14 years of age now.
How old are you?
I am 14.
That's right
You are 14 and you are at school.
School.
Oh God, he's getting away, mind.
Oh, look, he's escaping.
Look...
Look out, you'll fall.
You'll be sorry.
Of course I won't.
How many?
Six.
No, seven.
Where are we going to keep them?
Under the bed.
Suppose matron finds them.
She won't.
How do you know?
She's frightened to look under beds.
She is not.
She is, I tell you
Why?
In case there's a man there, of course.
Susan, you are dreadful.
You carry that and I'll bring the nets.
Susan, listen.
The bell. It's time to check in already.
So what?
We must hurry, Susan, we're terribly late.
What's the good? It'll take us at least ten minutes to get back.
And then we've got to change.
Oh, my knickers are all wet.
I must go, I mustn't be late.
Why not, Miss Lawson will only give you a black mark.
No she won't.
She'll sent me to Miss Dunken.
It's the third time I've been late this week already.
You can say you felt sick.
Said that on Tuesday.
Say you lost your way.
It was always like that.
Susan could persuade me to do anything.
I'd do it because she asked me.
And I was the one who got into trouble for it.
I was punished.
Oh,  I know I must be punished, of course, but not on my hands, please, not on my hands.
Today is music scholarship.
If you cane me, if my hands... please.
That afternoon my hands were swelling and blistered.
I played so badly I knew I hadn't a chance.
I'd set my heart on that scholarship.
Music was the only thing I really cared for even then.
The next time you sat for it you passed easily.
I never sat for it again.
During that year, my father died.
My mother had died when I was 6.
But now my father was dead too.
They told me I must go and live with my uncle Nicholas.
Uncle Nicholas wasn't really my uncle at all.
I believe he was my father's second cousin.
But he was rich and he was the only relative
I had in the world.
All right, let's have look at you.
Francesca, isn't it?
Yes, Uncle Nicholas.
Don't call me uncle. I'm not your uncle.
If you must call me anything, call me Nicholas.
Yes, Nicholas.
Turn around.
Take your hat off.
Yes, you're Florence's child all right.
Same straight back, same long legs, same nose.
I suppose you've got the same sanctimonious disposition.
Well, are you sanctimonious?
I don't know what the word means.
Let's hope you never will.
Come here.
Listen to me, listen carefully.
This is a bachelor establishment.
Do you know what that word means?
Yes, it means that you're not married.
It means I don't like women about the place.
When I came to live in this house
I promised myself no woman should ever enter it.
So far none ever has. You're the first.
I see.
What do you see?
That I'm to do my best not to intrude on your privacy more than I can possibly do.
Ring the bell... er, please.
Yes, Uncle... yes, Nicholas.
Would you like to stroke him?
No.
Why not?
I hate cats. They frighten me.
Oh, well, you'll soon will get used to them in this house.
Parker, this is Miss Cunningham
How do you do, Miss.
How do you...
Take her away, you know where to put her.
Yes, sir. This way, Miss.
Parker, who is that?
Mr. Nicholas' mother, Miss.
Is she dead?
I don't think so.
What happened to her then?
I can't tell you that, Miss.
I shall have ask Mr. Nicholas.
I don't think I should do that if I were you, Miss.
He doesn't like the subject to be discussed.
Her name is never mentioned in this house.
Do you really want to know what happened to her?
No.
Yes.
She left her old man.
Ran away with a singer
How do you know?
Everybody knows, it was in all the papers.
There was a divorce, Mr Nicholas had to give evidence. He was only twelve then.
How beastly of her!
Oh, I don't know.
You might do the same sometime.
You got what it takes.
How dare you!
Sorry, Miss.
I've a jolly good mind to tell Parker what you said.
Well, I...
All right, I won't.
You may go now.
Thank you, Miss.
James
Yes, Miss?
How long have you been here?
Twelve years, Miss.
Has it always been like this?
Yes, Miss, just like this.
Oh, dear!
Yes, Miss.
Those first weeks with Nicholas were the loneliest I ever spent.
Sometimes I wouldn't speak to a soul for days on end, except to say good morning.
Sometimes not even that.
Good morning, Nicholas.
Good morning, James.
Good morning, Sir.
All of the servants were men.
They were very polite.
But I always felt they resented my being there.
Nicholas made me feel like that too, but he had a different way of showing it.
He would limp about the house, leaning on his cane and look right through me as though I wasn't there.
On the rare occasions when he did send for me
I was so nervous I could hardly speak.
Mr. Nicholas has been asking for you, Miss.
Where is he?
In the drawing room, Miss.
You wanted me, Nicholas?
Do you recognize this?
Yes. 
Did you notice it was addressed to me?
Yes.
Then why didn't you give it to me?
I... forgot.
Did you really forget?
No.
I see.
Did you know what was in it?
Yes, it was a letter from Miss Dunken.
What about?
About me.
Did you know what she says?
No.
Let me tell you.
She says, let's see...
... your intelligence is rather above the average. Do you agree?
I don't know.
She also says you can sew.
Is that correct?
I suppose so.
Francesca is extremely well-behaved, and has a charming friendly disposition. when she has overcome the initial shyness, which sometimes prevents her making friends easily.
Are you shy?
Yes.
Of me?
A little.
There's no need to be,
I won't eat you.
I know, but I...
But what?
Nothing.
What else does the encyclopaedic Miss Dunken say of her fledgling?
She has studied French, German, elementary mathematics, History and soon and so on.
Francesca has an extraordinary talent for music.
She plays the piano extremely well and has an appreciation of music far in advance of her years.
Play something for me.
I can't.
Why not?
Please don't ask me. I can't.
Come here.
Sit down, play something.
I can't! I won't!
After that Nicholas made me practice
4 or 5 hours a day.
He was always beside me now, listening to everything I did.
It was terribly hard work.
But Nicholas saw to it that I didn't shirk one minute of it.
He was a slave driver.
But he was a wonderful teacher, too.
He knew instinctively how to get best out of me.
He knew more about the spirit of music than any man I ever met.
Yet, he didn't play it very well himself.
He used to say rather bitterly:
"Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach."
All right.
I've taught you all I know.
It's time you had some proper training.
I've arranged for you to start at the college tomorrow. You'll find all the details here.
Report to the secretary 10 o'clock.
Oh, Nicholas, thank you.
Don't do that!
Don't do that ever again.
Next morning when I got up,
Nicholas had gone away.
He didn't come back for nearly 3 months.
Meanwhile I'd started at the college and I was far too busy finding out how little I knew to worry about Nicholas.
Those first months at the college were the happiest in my life.
Though I don't suppose I spoke to a soul the whole time.
Except to say good morning or ask one of the teachers a question.
And I didn't care whether I had any friends or not.
I didn't care.
You didn't care because you were happy.
No.
He took away my happiness.
Who did?
Nicholas. He hated me to be happy.
Had you no one else else, no friends?
Only Peter.
Peter? Tell me about Peter.
Where did you meet him?
At a little café where most of us used to go for lunch.
It was kept by an old Italian who used to play the fiddle at La Scala.
I remember the date.
June 14th.
And the dress I was wearing and my old beret.
I had just finished eating when
I felt someone was staring at me.
I looked up... there was Peter.
You know, you're working too hard.
I like work.
I like ravioli but I don't eat it all the time.
I don't work all the time.
I bet you don't stop even when you're asleep. And you look so serious.
Don't you ever smile?
When there's something to smile at.
Come on, put that score away. I'll pay your bill. I wanna show you something.
Thank you,  I...
Come on,  come on.
Peter was like that.
I'd seen him before at the college, but I'd never spoken to him and I didn't think that he'd even noticed me.
He was an American working his way through college.
Playing in a dance band at night and studying during the day.
Will you please send this back.
You know, there's practically nothing wrong with you.
Thank you.
You're a bit of a prig, but that's the way you've been brought up.
And you're extremely rude.
I suppose that's the way you've been brought up.
Check. I was dragged up.
I know it.
I must go.
Why do you always run away when you're having fun?
I don't. I just have more important things to do.
That's the trouble with you!
How often you take the evening off and go to the movies?
Never!
There you are!
I don't like films.
But you should!
Why?
Because they take you out of yourself out of real life altogether.
Is that such a good thing?
Of course it is, now look.
Suppose this is a film....
Poor, struggling musician, that's me.
Meets a snooty rich girl, that's you.
You know what happens?
What?
She's cold, and stuck up and rather unattainable.
But underneath it all, she's falling for him in spite of herself, see?
No.
That's because you don't go to films.
You know what happens next?
No.
He just leans forward and kisses her.
You know what she does?
No.
She pushes him away and walks right out of the place. leaving him standing there looking like a dummy!
But that's only in films.
In real life, it's quite different.
Yes?
Oh, yes, quite different.
In real life, I just lean forward and kiss you like this.
Do you know what you do?
Yes.
You know this happens in films, too.
Will you please go away?
After the snooty rich girl walks out on tbe poor, struggling musician you know, when he kisses her, they're both awfully unhappy.
And after a day or two they both take to hunting the spot where they first met.
Why?
Because of both getting pretty hungry, 
I guess.
Mariani, two raviolis.
I don't want anything to eat. I've had my lunch.
Don't worry, you're not getting any.
They're both for me.
I want you to realize I've been so miserable
I haven't eaten for a week!
Good evening!
Good evening, Nicholas.
I didn't know you were back.
Yes, I'm back.
You're looking rather pale.
Have you been working too hard?
I don't think so.
You're not ill? No, I'm quiet well, thank you.
Aren't you going to play for me?
Yes, of course.
Are you mad?
But you asked me to play.
I ask you to play!
If you can't think of anything better play a chromatic scale or a 5 fingers exercise.
But spare me your suburban shopgirl trash!
Peter?
Hm?
Do you know why I didn't come out with you yesterday?
Uncle Nicholas.
No. I went to the pictures.
You dared, eh?
Who with?
By myself.
It was a most interesting film...
It was about a girl who... knew a boy loved her but hadn't the courage to ask her to marry him. so... she thought about it... and decided that if he didn't ask her she'd have to ask him.
So...are you listening?
Yeah, hm-hmm.
Well, this girl... in the film, I mean.. she decided that she'd have to ask him herself.
Did she?
No.
At the last minute, her courage failed her.
Peter?
Hm?
Do you remember saying that films were the reverse of real life?
Hm-hmm.
Well, they are.
I mean, my courage hasn't failed me.
Peter, I want you to marry me.
That night as I sat up and waited for
Nicholas to come home,
I thought there's nothing to be frightened of.
He can't do anything.
Peter would take care of me now.
And then I heard his key in the lock.
Nicholas!
Good evening, Francesca.
Isn't it rather late for you to be up?
Yes, I suppose it is.
But, Nicholas, I must talk to you.
Won't you wait till the morning?
No, it's important.
Very well.
Nicholas!
Won't you wait till we're inside?
I'm sorry.
Hm...
Well, now, what was it you wanted to say to me?
I don't know how to start.
Why not start at the beginning?
That's the usual way, isn't it?
Well, there's nothing usual about this.. so I'll start at the end...
Nicholas, I'm engaged.
Oh...
Well, good night.
Nicholas...
Did you heard what I said?
Perfectly!
But... don't you understand?
I've found a man I love
...and I want to marry him and he's asked me and I've said yes...
Go to bed!
And, Francesca, before you go to sleep, pack a bag.
We're leaving for Paris in the morning.
Paris? You mean you're taking me to Paris?
Yes?
But I can't go.
I won't go.
I want to stay here with Peter.
What could I do in Paris?
You'll carry on with your studies.
I won't!
I won't go, I tell you!
You can't make me.
I don't care whether I ever play again.
If you take away me from Peter
I won't ever play again, I mean it!
Why can't you be kind to me?
Why do you always treat me as though
I were a child?
Because you are!
I'm not! I'm a grown up, I'm a woman.
I have a right to live my own life.
I know what I want.
You're just trying to take it away from me!
The only thing I've really cared for!
How old are you?
I won't go, I won't! I won't!
I said, how old are you?
Seventeen.
Exactly, until you're 21 you're in my care.
I'm your guardian. Your legal guardian.
Do you understand what that means?
No.
It means you can't marry without my consent.
You can't even leave this house without my permission.
If you do, I can have you brought back by the police, if necessary.
It's my duty to see that you behave properly and don't make a fool of yourself.
Is that clear?
Yes.
Then go to bed.
Go to bed.
From that moment, Nicholas never let me out of his sight.
It was seven years before
I saw Peter again.
Seven years of music.
Paris, Vienna, Rome.
Seven years of Nicholas planning my life.
Turning me into his dream of a concert pianist.
We lunched and dined in crowded restaurants.
We were always alone.
Of course you can't play tennis.
It would ruin your hands.
Nicholas was always reminding me to take care of my hands.
Take care of your hands.
They're your only real asset.
Nicholas was always at my elbow. never left me alone for a day.
I don't suppose anyone ever led such a sheltered life as I did with Nicholas.
Always think of your hands.
They're your most precious possession.
Nicholas never let me forget that I was to be a pianist.
Never risk harming your hands....
He always talked of music and my hands.
Always look after your hands.
Remember.
You must take care of your hands.
My precious hands.
Your hands... your hands... your hands!
Take after your hands.
No! No! No!
Spread your skirt!
Let the knee drop right down!
Now try it again!
Smile! For heaven's sake, smile!
And remember, bow to the conductor first... then to the audience, all of us.
At last, Nicholas decided that I was ready for my first concert appearance.
It was in Venice.
Everyone was very kind.
Monsignor Leoni came all the way from Rome to hear my debut.
They're lovely,  thank you.
You're ready?
Yes, Nicholas!
Don't forget. Wait for Pirelli to lead you onto the platform.
Take your time
Don't give him the signal to start until you're quite ready.
You've got a handkerchief?
Yes.
Turn around.
And around.
Let me see the front again.
Anna!
That hem's hanging badly.
See to it.
Don't let it happen again!
Yes, sir.
I happen to be a very old friend of Miss
Cunningham's.
Francesca!
Susan!
Darling.
You're Susan Brook, isn't it?
Dear, how clever of you to remember after all these years.
Only it's not Brook now, it's Krobotovitch. Horrid, isn't it?
Darling, I'm married.
Francesca and I were at school together, you know.
Darling, you haven't change a bit.
Now you're a famous pianist.
I only saw your name on the bills this afternoon and I said to my husband...
He's my second...
The first was crunchy cornflakes.
This one is arch treasures.
So much nicer, don't you think?
Susan, you are dreadful.
I said to my husband, 
"I was at school with that girl!"
He said,  "It may not be the same one".
You know how silly men are,  my dear.
I said, oh, yes it is, mine was a pianist, too"
Then I told him that screamingly funny story of how you failed your music exam, remember?
It was when we were at school.
We played truant one day to go and catch frogs or lizzards or something quite revolting and I fell in the water
We got found out. The whole thing was my fault, of course.
But the headmistress was absolutely livid and insisted on caning us both most frightfully.
Darling, do you put that down.
Of course, I couldn't have cared less.
But the joke of the whole thing was
Francesca was sitting for a music exam that same afternoon.
She played nothing on earth and failed miserably.
Just thing of Francesca failing her first music exam.
It truly is too funny.
What's the matter, Francesca, is something wrong?
Nothing, Nicholas, thank you.
Oh, did I say something I shouldn't?
Well, I mustn't interrupt you anymore.
I'll go out front and listen.
Darling, you simply must come have tea with me one day and meet all my husband's relatives.
Terribly odd people.
Quite frighteningly rich.
Goodbye, darling! Astonishing luck.
Don't forget to ring me! Good bye.
My dear good man,
I'm sure we're in the front row.
I shall never forget it, never.
That awful fear of my hands.
I could almost feel my fingers swelling as I played.
I know it's nonsense but I really did feel it.
Yes.
I'm sure you did.
You never saw Peter all this time?
No.
I managed to write to him from Paris but the letters came back marked "Gone away".
Somehow I didn't mind.
I know it sounds foolish.
But in some strange way, I knew that one day we must get back to London again.
And that when we did,
I'd find Peter waiting.
I knew exactly how it would happen
 and sure enough it did.
I was in my dressing room.
It was in the Opera House, in Copenhagen.
I was going to play the Schumann.
And the door opened and Nicholas came in.
He always came in without knocking.
That's how sure of me he was.
Cable from London, 
They want you for the Arbertour next month, do you want to go?
Why ask me? You usually settle these things without consulting me.
If I do it it's only to save you trouble.
You know you can do exactly as you please.
Can I, Nicholas?
Of course!
You mean I can refuse this offer?
Any offer?
Of course, if you wish to.
No, I think I should like to go.
I'll wire them now.
That night when Nicholas came to collect me after the concert he knocked at my door.
Come in!
It was the first time I ever remember him doing so.
You're ready?
Almost.
Would you like to dine at the Viking?
If you like.
We can go to the Rotunda if you'd rather.
No, the Viking will do.
Francesca, there's something I'd like to say to you.
Yes, Nicholas?
You said tonight that I never consulted you over anything.
It doesn't matter.
But it does.
If I haven't done so it's because I wanted your life to be as smooth and easy as possible.
To save you worry.
To enable you to concentrate on your music.
No, but...
Let me finish.
I've devoted years to converting a very ordinary little girl in pigtails into a first class artist.
I've given up everything to be with you.
To help your career.
And yet I've made no demands on you at all.
No demands of any sort.
Do you understand?
Yes, Nicholas.
You're completely free to do as you please, to come and go as you choose.
Yes, Nicholas.
Good, then it's understood.
Now, I've invited the Baron Von Ullman and the Princess to dine.
They're waiting for us at The Viking.
Tomorrow, after lunch there'll be a little reception on the Burgomaster's.
I've told them you'll be tired.
You'll play only once, no encores.
Then, on Thursday, we'll...
Are you ready?
Just a minute.
On Thursday I've arranged for you to play for the patients of the national hospital.
Ready?
Yes, Nicholas.
Now, smile
There are a hundred people at the stage door.
No autographs tonight but you might throw these from the car.
Where's that smile?
Nervous?
No.
I'll be all right!
Of course you'll be all right.
They're in for a suprise.
They haven't heard anything like you for 20 years.
Ready, Miss Cunningham?
Thank you.
Good luck, my dear.
Thank you, Nicholas.
I'll stay back here and wait for you.
I'd made up my mind that directly the concerto was over, I would go and look for Peter.
I suppose I must have realized that he probably wouldn't be at the club anymore.
But what I hadn't bargained for was that the name of the club should have changed.
And the hat check girl, and the band.
All I could find out was that Peter had had a row with the management and gone to  the Golden Fleece.
At the Golden Fleece someone remembered that they'd seen him at the Monte Carlo.
At the Monte Carlo nobody knew where he was.
Except for a receptionist who thought he'd gone to the halls in a big stage band.
And then when I had given up all hope of finding him
My taxi suddenly stopped and there, looking straight at me, was Peter's face.
Well, what happened then?
I'd rather not talk about it.
You can tell me.
I don't want to talk about it.
All right.
Tell me about Max.
Max?
Yes, you remember Max.
Maxwell Leyden.
Yes.
Tell me about him.
I was outside the door, listening.
You didn't know I listened through keyholes, did you?
That's what Nicholas did for me.
The door was half open anyway, and I could hear everything they were saying inside.
Excellent cigar! Kingley's in Bond Street import them for me especially.
I keep them for my closest friends. and those of whom I have favor to ask.
And I come in the second category.
Yes.
Then I hope it's in my power to grant it.
I'll come straight to the point.
For several years I've been a great admirer of your work, especially your portraits
I'll never forget that lovely thing you did of the American ambassador's wife.
Thank you.
Now I'd like you to paint my ward.
Will you do it?
I'm afraid that will be impossible.
May one ask why?
I don't paint portraits anymore.
Besides, I've never met your ward.
That can be remedied.
She is not unattractive.
I'm convinced she's lovely.
But that doesn't interest me.
Maybe I've known too many beautiful women.
I've set my heart on it.
Mr. Cunningham, I just don't paint portraits anymore..
It interferes with my serious work.
Very well.
That's the end of that.
Good evening!
Francesca, this is Maxwell Leyden.
My ward, Miss Cunningham.
How do you do.
How do you do.
I've often heard you play.
Oh? Where?
In my studio.
I've all your records.
That's very kind of you.
And are you doing a portrait of anyone exciting at the moment?
No... no.
Nothing exciting at the moment.
I was just suggesting that Mr Leyden should paint your portrait.
Oh. But I don't care to have my portrait painted.
I beg your pardon?
May one ask why?
Certainly.
it interferes with my serious work. Good night, Mr. Leyden.
Good night, Nicholas.
I hope my being here doesn't interfere with your playing.
Not at all. When I'm working
I lose all my contact with the outside world.
I sometimes go on long past mealtime.
Do you?
Hm.
If you do that today, I'll just slip away... if you don't mind.
No.
I'm merely being considerate.
Considerate?
To my stomach.
Can you really work as well when I'm playing?
No!
You're terribly....
It was our bargain I'm not to interfere with your work.
Even if my playing interferes with yours?
That's what we agreed on.
You'd like me to sit for you properly, up on a dais, wouldn't you?
Naturally.
With my hands, and arms and head all arranged in a striking pose.
Yes.
Under strict instructions not to move until you say so.
Yes.
Would you still like me to do that for you?
I would love you to do that.
In spite of our bargain?
In spite of our bargain.
Well, I'm not going to.
Can I move?
In just one second.
My neck's getting stiff.
I'm getting cramps in a most peculiar place.
All right.
Move.
May I look?
Not yet. You go and dress.
I think you're being most secretive.
And you're being most curious.
Oh, thank you.
Would you like some tea?
No, thank you.
I'm sure you would like to get back to that piano.
Oh, no. I doubt but I should ever be able to play again.
Oh?
My neck's so stiff I shan't be able to see the keyboard.
I am sorry. But I think I can cure that. Turn around.
Is that it?
Hm-hmm.
Better?
Lovely.
Everything about you is lovely.
I thought I was the ugly duckling in your gallery of beauties.
No, you're not. You are...
What?
Must you really know?
Hm.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever painted.
Not because you're beautiful, but because I'm in love with you.
Hopelessly in love with you.
Good night.
Leyden, I'd like a word with you before you go.
Do you mind if I ask you a question?
Of course not, as long as you don't move.
Last time you were here, you said something that worried me very much.
Did I?
But you must know that you did.
Oh, you mean when I told you I was in love with you.
Yes.
But why should that worry you so much?
Surely it's the most natural thing in the world.
Not for me.
I hate love. I hate being in love.
I never wanted it to happen to me again.
If you deny yourself love, you might as well be dead.
I'd rather be dead than go through what I've been through all over again.
I was happy in the life
I built up for myself.
I put a fine high wall of music around me and nothing could touch me.
I was safe and secure.
Then you had to come along and knock it all down. I hate you for that.
On the contrary, you love me.
Maybe I do.
Francesca!
Well, would you like to look at it?
It's very... very good.
I hate to think of Nicholas having it.
Why?
Because he looks right through me and
I hate to think of Nicholas being able to do that.
You're frightened of Nicholas, aren't you?
Yes.
Why?
He has some extraordinary power over me.
You'll think it's absurd but he knows what I'm thinking, he knows what I'm going to do. almost before I know myself.
He's quite determined I shan't do anything that interferes with his plans.
Then why do you stay with him?
I don't know.
I don't think I can help myself.
Don't let's talk about it.
All right.
Can I get you a drink?
Yes, please.
What are you going to do now that you've finished it?
Take a holiday, I suppose.
Have I been such hard work?
No, no.
Yes, perhaps you have.
Where will you go?
I don't know yet. Italy, perhaps.
I've got an old tumbled down villa there on a hill above the sea.
Very quiet, so restful.
Sounds lovely.
Will you paint?
Not unless you come with me.
Francesca, must we keep on pretending?
I'm in love with you and you love me.
We could be very happy.
We're both tired and miserable. and we are both losing something we really want only because you are frightened.
Can't you forget it, come away with me?
To Italy?
Hm-hmm.
I'd be a very poor companion.
I don't believe it, but I'll risk it.
I'd like to, Max, very much.
What is it, darling?
I was wondering how I was going to tell Nicholas.
Let me tell him.
No, I'll manage somehow.
Max, it's not important, but just how do we arrange things?
How do you mean?
Do you want to marry me?
I never thought of that.
I see.
Do you want me to?
I'm not sure.
You know if you want...
No...
I don't think it matters.
I see.
And when are you thinking of getting married?
I don't know, probably never.
But you said you were going to Italy.
I am.
You mean you're going to live with him openly.
Yes.
How can you even think of such thing?
I won't listen to another word.
Nicholas, I don't care whether you listen or not.
I don't care what you say or what you do.
This is my life and I propose to live it in the way I think...
Francesca!
It's no good, Nicholas. you can't browbeat me anymore.
I'm grateful to you for some of the things you've done for me.
But I'll never forgive you for some of the others.
Anyway, it's over now.
I'm going with Max next week.
Please don't try to stop me...
...or make me change my mind.
Because I won't change my mind.
Nothing's going to stop me.
Is that clear?
I'll say goodbye to you before I go.
What do you want?
Francesca, I haven't deserved this of you.
I've always treated you as though you were my... my own daughter.
All the love and sympathy I've had
I gave it to you.
My life hasn't been a happy one. I've never told you about it and I'm not going to tell you now.
But you are the one beautiful thing that's been in my life... and I can't live without you.
You must know that.
I can't give you up.
I won't give you up, you're a great artist!
Great artists don't just happen, they have to be made and I've made you.
I've spent 10 years training you, molding you.
You're my life's work.
Now you want to throw it all away on a man who doesn't even want to marry you.
Francesca, listen to me!
You can't stand up against me.
You haven't got the strength.
You'll do as I say.
I demand that you give up this man.
I demand that you send him away.
Listen, we'll go to America.
They've been asking for you in New York for months.
Now we can go. We'll go.
You and I together
Francesca!
This happened before once, you remember?
You came away with me then.
You weren't sorry, were you?
You didn't really love that boy, you don't love Leyden, and I'll tell you why.
You belong to me.
We must always be together.
You know that, don't you?
Promise me you'll stay with me always!
Promise!
Very well, if that's the way you want it.
If you won't play for me you shan't play for anyone else ever again.
Max!
What happened, darling?
Get in the car.
Max wouldn't let me go back into the house even to pack a bag.
He gave me his raincoat to keep me warm and then we drove for what seemed to be hours through the cold starless night
I felt completely numb.
All I could realize was that I was free.
Free at last from Nicholas and everything he stood for.
Nothing could touch me again, nothing!
Then...
I woke up in bed at the nursing home.
For a moment I couldn't think what had happened.
And then it all came crawling in on me.
I looked down at my hands.
They were bandaged and I couldn't move them.
I knew then that I should never play again.
Thank you, nurse.
Hello, Francesca.
Oh, that's nothing.
Hello, darling
Why didn't you kill me promptly?
It was an accident, darling, 
I couldn't help it.
No, I know you couldn't, but...
But I'd rather be dead.
But you're scarcely hurt.
The doctors say you'll be up in a day or two.
I don't want to get up.
I want to die.
Why?
Look at my hands.
They were only slightly burned.
No bones broken.
Nothing that won't heel up in a week or two.
I don't believe you.
But it is so!
Ask the doctors, ask the nurses.
I don't believe them either.
You're all saying this to keep me quiet.
I know, I tell you, I know.
I shall never able to be use them again.
I shall never be able to play anymore.
Francesca.
Don't touch me!
I wish I were dead.
I wish I were dead!
Thank you, nurse.
Your coat, Doctor.
I'll be back tomorrow at 5 o'clock.
Yes, Doctor.
Shall I have another injection, ready?
No, that won't be necessary.
Miss Cunningham and I are friends now.
So here we have Francesca Cunningham's case history.
The caning at school resulting in the failure at the music examination and fear that her hands might be injured, the attempt by her guardian to smash her hands finally the car crash, the shock of finding herself in hospital with her hands bandaged.
Now, all these things together have produced a fixation, a barrier in the patient's subconscious mind. which is now preventing her full recovery.
It is this barrier which we now have to break down.
And I believe I have found the way to do it.
That's why I've put her under hypnosis.
Now, with the help of the music, music which we know she loves,
I'm going to suggest to her the way to conquer this fixation.
If I can make her play the piano.
I shall wake her up while she is actually playing and then she will know there is nothing really wrong with her hands.
I've got some records here made by Miss Cunningham a few years ago.
I propose to play one of them in a moment.
You put this on, will you?
Now, Miss Cunningham,
I want you to listen to me carefully and do exactly as I tell you.
You understand, don't you?
Right!
Now.
Give me your hand and get up.
I want you to come with me.
I want you to sit down here at the piano.
That's right.
Now, would you like to hear some music today?
Nod to me if you want me to play you some music.
Good!
There, there is your music, just as I promised you.
Isn't it beautiful?
Don't you want to play it yourself?
Play?
Yes.
Don't you want to play?
I can't.
Yes, yes, you can!
You can if you want to.
And you do want to, don't you?
Nod to me if you want to.
Then play!
Your hands are on the keys now.
Your hands want to play.
You want to play, don't you!
Try, try!
Promise you'll stay with me always
Promise me... Very well.
If that's the way you want it, very well.
If you won't play for me you shan't play for anyone else ever again.
No, please, don't.
Take me away, take me away...
Oh, yes, sir.
Will you take a seat, please.
I would like to speak to you for a moment, please.
Certainly.
I've just come from the nursing home.
They told me you have removed
Miss Cunningham from their care.
Is that so?
Yes.
Mr. Leyden I feel it's my duty to go on treating her.
I'm sorry, Doctor.
After what has happened, surely even you will agree that she has suffered enough.
She will go on suffering until she is cured.
All she needs is rest.
Yes, but that's for her body not for her mind.
Her mind will restore itself if she's left alone.
No, her mind needs treatment.
Treatment?
Your treatment is likely to unhinge her mind altogether.
Mr. Leyden, are you aware of the responsibility if you prevent me from finishing my treatment?
It's Miss Cunningham who will have to pay for it with more suffering.
And one day you will have to come back to me.
Only then it might be too late.
I'm sure I can get results if we carry on right away.
I'm sorry, doctor.
Very well.
How is she today?
Fine, thank you.
I see.
Mr. Leyden this is all wrong.
This is all wrong.
I do not want to fail with this particular case.
Would you mind if I went to
Miss Cunningham's guardian and asked his permission to treat her?
Not at all.
Only he won't be her guardian much longer.
No? Why is that?
We are to be married next week.
Oh, I see.
Excuse me, but have you got her consent?
I propose to ask her.
Mr. Leyden, that poor girl is in no condition to make up her mind on anything at the moment.
I warn you, what you're doing is very dangerous.
I'm prepared to take the risk, Doctor.
Very well.
Good day!
Good day.
Doctor Larsen?
It's good of you to see me.
Take a seat.
Thank you.
Your business?
I've come to ask your assistance in a case in which I'm working.
What is the case?
The name of my patient is Miss Cunningham,
Francesca Cunningham.
Well?
Miss Cunningham is your niece and...
She's my second cousin.
I see.
But she has lived with you here in this house and I take it you have often heard her play the piano, practicing and so on...
What is all this leading up to?
I have a record here.
It is of a tune which has assumed some importance in the case.
I wonder if I could play it to you.
And if you would be good enough to tell me whether you know anything about it.
Whether perhaps it has any sentimental associations or is connected with anyone she knew.
Go ahead!
Thank you!
Don't expect me to know anything about her private affairs.
It is always possible.
Get out!
You dropped you cane, Mr. Cunningham.
Allow me to thank you.
You have helped me after all.
I always knew of the power you have over Miss Cunningham.
But now I know why.
I know what she means to you.
All right.
I wish to see Mr. Leyden.
Mr. Leyden is not at home, Sir.
I'll wait.
It's quite safe.
I shan't steal the pictures.
Francesca!
So you're still angry with me.
I'm not to be forgiven, eh?
It is of no consequence.
I'm not stupid enough to expect forgiveness of anyone except myself.
And I'd never forgive myself if I allowed you to go on like this.
You know there is nothing the matter with you, don't you?
You know you can be cured quite easily and play again if you want to.
No, I don't know. I don't think so.
Larsen can cure you if you give him the chance.
I can understand Leyden not wanting you to get better.
It would mean he'd lose you and of course that's the last thing he'd want.
But you? I can't understand you.
Don't you want to be the real
Francesca Cunningham?
I shall never play again, never.
If you don't, it's your own fault.
My fault?
It's no use brooding over the past.
It's your future you should be thinking about.
I have no future.
Larsen can give it back to you.
He couldn't last time.
I see.
Larsen failed to work a miracle so he is not to be allowed another chance, is that it?
Yes.
Won't you let him try again?
No.
Not for me?
No.
You're the most obstinate woman
I've ever known.
Do you remember the first time I asked you to play for me?
You were as stubborn as a mule.
I was frightened.
Frightened? Am I such a frightening person?
Yes.
You're not frightened now, you're smiling.
It's funny.
What's funny?
It's so different when you're kind.
When you're like this, I'd do anything for you.
Then you'll play again, won't you?
All you've got to do is to make up your mind.
Larsen will do the rest.
I can't, Nicholas, I've tried.
Look at me! Look at me!
I tell you there's nothing to be frightened of ever again.
Nothing to be frightened of ever again.
You really want to play, don't you?
Yes, I do, Nicholas!
And you'll see Larsen.
Yes, I'll see Larsen!
The clinic?
May I speak to Doctor Larsen, please?
You want me?
Are you Mr. Gay?
That's right.
My name is Larsen.
How do you do?
I'm a doctor and...
I don't need a doctor, I'm pretty fit as I am.
I'm very glad to hear that.
But I've really have come here because I believe you know a patient of mine.
Miss Cunningham, Francesca Cunningham.
Sure, I do, but why?
Is she in any trouble?
In very great trouble, Mr. Gay.
And I believe you can help me to put it right.
You knew Miss Cunningham very well at one time, did you not?
Yeah, I did, but...
Then she went away to the Continent.
When she come back, first thing she did was to come and see you, here.
Yeah.
Mr. Gay, I want you to tell me what happened that night.
Nothing, nothing at all.
Something must have happened.
Oh, I told her I was married if that's what you mean.
How did she take it?
She just walked out on me.
She is like that, you know.
Has Miss Cunningham ever met your wife?
Not that I know of.
We were divorced 2 years ago.
I'm sorry.
That's all right.
There is one more thing.
There was a tune you used to dance to.
A waltz.
Yes.
You haven't got a gramophone record of it, by any chance.
Oh, I'm afraid I haven't.
Could you get one?
Yeah, I'm sure I could.
It's old, of course, and pretty corny but it's still sweet if you like them that way.
Yes, Mr. Gay, I want you to get that record for me, or rather, for Miss Cunningham and bring it to this address, do you mind?
Not at all.
Tomorrow, tomorrow at seven.
Okay.
Thank you, Mr. Gay.
Good bye, Doctor. Anything I can do, bring my boys along...
Your boys?
No, that won't be necessary.
It was not your boys she was in love with.
This way, sir.
Who is that?
His name is Peter Gay.
He is the apostle of a new religion called swing.
What has he got to do with Miss Cunningham?
He's the man she wanted to marry.
I shouldn't do that. It won't help.
What is that music?
Call it that if you like.
It's a tune they used to dance to.
Why should he be playing it now?
Weren't you at the last little experiment he made?
Yes.
Then you ought to be able to imagine what's going on.
Whisky?
Yes, please.
Parker!
Sir?
Whisky for Mr. Leyden, please.
Well?
Well what?
Did anything happen?
That's what I'm trying to figure out myself.
Is she all right? What did Larsen say?
I guess it all adds up to something, but he's away ahead of me.
What's the good of turning the clock back anyway?
Never did anyone any good.
I wouldn't be too sure of that.
Have a drink.
Thanks.
Doesn't she play beautifully?
Is she playing?
Yes, that's my Francesca.
Can I go up now?
It would be pity to interrupt her.
Doesn't she want me with her?
Perhaps.
What do you mean "perhaps"?
Forgive me, gentlemen. I'm afraid
I should have explained to you at once.
But the music has put it out my head.
Yes, I think I can promise you a complete cure.
But... you have to prepare yourself for a new Francesca.
A new and very different person.
In what way?
You see the past is over for her now, quite over.
Her mind is clear and the clouds have been swept away.
She's no longer afraid.
Whether you will be entirely satisfied with the change in her, I don't know
But it might be wise not to expect too much.
Are you trying to tell me she...
I'm trying to tell you, will she want to be with the one she loves or the one she's been happiest with or the one she cannot do without?
Or the one she trusts?
And who is that?
It would hardly be fair of me to say.

[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]
Excuse me. Jane. Bye.
Use a cup of coffee, Slim?
[COUGHING]
- What's the matter, go down wrong?
- It was seeing you up close that did it.
I've had unkind remarks made about my puss but I never made anybody choke before.
You've got a good face, Mr. Carson.
It's just that I've seen you in pictures.
When you came at me, I choked.
- Am I that bad?
- Oh. you're great.
But you know how it is. you see somebody on the screen...
...and then you see them in the ?esh. well. it kind of gets you.
- Does it?
-Sure.
Especially when I know you've been light up close to Joan Leslie.
- It's that way. huh?
- I used to dream about he! in New Guinea.
Well, I guess she's been dreamed about clear around the world.
Will you sit down at my table?
Don't mind it I do. but it's against the rules to! us busboys to sit down very long.
Please. I--
I want to ask you about Joan Leslie.
Heel that she's just like the gills back home at heart.
You're perfectly right, pal.
She's not married or anything. is she?
No.
I wonder it it's because she hasn't met a man yet who--
- Well, who feels about her the way--
-The way you do?
Well. yes. sir.
Well. I...
Slim. I wanna wish you all the luck in the world.
Thank you. sir.
Watch it, fellas. Corning through here.
Let me through.
- Bette. is Joan Leslie on the list tonight?
- I don't think so. Why?
Some young Purple Heart, fresh from New Guinea...
...just opened up his heart on Joan.
It was very funny or beautiful.
Bette, excuse me, fellas.
Bette, is Joan Leslie coming tonight?
Not that I know of.
The politest guy that ever walked in here just asked.
- Tall and slim?
-I took him over to Stanwyck for refueling.
Don't get your hopes up.
He's been Leslie-ized.
- Will you stop? I've been Reagan-ized.

ANNOUNCER:
Presenting: The Sons of the Pioneers.
[SINGING]
See them tumbling dawn
Pledging their love to the ground
Lonely but free I'll be found
Drifting along
With the tumbling tumbleweeds
I'm a mvin' cowboy
Ridin' all day long
Tumbleweed: around me
Sing their lonely song
Nights underneath a prairie moon
I ride alone and sing a tune
See them tumbling down
I really go 10! that cowboy music.
Me too. it reminds me of Flatbush.
Lonely but free I'll be found
Drifting along
With the tumbling tumbleweeds
Hey. that's Roy Rogers and Trigger.
[YELLS]
Boys and gals. it really is swell getting a chance to be here...
...at the Hollywood Canteen. to meet you all in person and say howdy.
This is Trigger's way of saying hello.
Trigger seems to like the ladies in here.
How about throwing them a kiss. Trigger?
Will you give me a kiss? How about me?
Oh. just one? Just give me one kiss.
Come on.
Doggone. he sure kisses juicy.
[SINGING] Wildcat Willy
Luukin' mighty pale
Was standing by the sheriff': side
And when that sheriff said,
"I'm sending you to jail"
Wildcat raised his head and cried
Oh, give me land, lots of land
Under starry skies above
Don't fence me in
Let me ride through the wide
Open country that I love
Don't fence me in
Let me be by myself
In the evenin' breeze
And listen to the murmur
Of the cottonwood trees
Send me off forever
But I ask you. please
Don't fence me in
Just tum me loose
Let me straddle my old saddle
Underneath the Western skies
On my cayuse
Let me wander over yonder
Till I see the mountain rise
I wanna ride to the ridge
Where the West commences
And gaze at the moon
Till I lose my senses
I can't look at hobbles
And I can't stand fences
Don't fence me in
Just tum me loose
Let me straddle my old saddle
Underneath the Western skies
On my cayuse
Let me wander over yonder
Till I see the mountain rise
I want to ride to the ridge
Where the West commences
And gaze at the moon
Till I lose my senses
I can't look at hobbles
And I can't stand fences
Don't fence me in
I'm the ruvin' kind
So if you don't mind
All that I can say is:
"Come on, Trigger
Let's be on our way"
Pal. I want you to shake hands with the hand that shook hands with Roy Rogers.
- Look.
- Thank you very much. Miss Lupino.
Not at all.
Good evening. sergeant.
First night at the Canteen?
- Yes. ma'am.
- Well. can I show you the ropes?
Miss Lupino. you may show me anything your lovely heart desires.
IDA:
Shall we sit here?
Thank you.
As a rule. Miss Lupino. movie stars don't interest me none.
But you, you're different.
Really. sergeant? In what way?
Well. as Flenchie in my battalion would say:
“You have a certain is ne sais quui. "
French.
Oh. is it?
Yeah.
Yes, we adventurers pick up quite a bit as we travel over the Earth.
I'll bet you're not kidding.
Well. go on. sergeant. speak to me some more in French.
You adventurers interest me.
Well. there's "Vamuur."
"Tau/ours I'amuur, " 10! example.
[SPEAKS IN FRENCH]
Well, I'm doing my best, sergeant, go on.
Leave us say that we're in a little French salle privée 10! deux.
Okay. let's.
We have just consummated our putage.

It is Ia Nuuvelle Année.
New Year's.

[IDA SPEAKING IN FRENCH]

[CLATTERS]
Oh. no. you were doing very well.
Now. let's go back to Ia Nuuvelle Année, shall we?
No. I 'feel my malaria coming back.
I better go outside.
Pardonnez-moi- Excuse me.
[BOTH SPEAKING IN FRENCH]
[SPEAKING IN FRENCH]
- Look. pal.
- Yes?
Take my advice:
This won't get you no place. I tried it.
- You tried what, sergeant?
-French.
Well. it just happens I was born that way.
- Bye-bye. Ilene.
- Bye.
How you doing?
It doesn't look like Miss Leslie's here.
You think you got troubles.
Aren't you the boy who won the kiss last night?
- Uh-huh.
- And you're back 10! more?
Gosh. just looking at he! would make me happy.
WOMAN:
Wow!
Oh. Ilene. do you think dancing will ever come back?
My feet feel like fire bricks.
Well. who's little who are you?
Oh. this is Patty Andrews.
- Hello, I thought you looked familiar.
-Well, I generally am.
But a BOO-ton Marine took it out of me. dancing.
Aha!
Honey. I'm gonna dance your hips light out of their sockets.
Oh. please!
I beg your pardon, young man...
...but exactly what did you say you were going to do with Miss Andrews' sockets?
Dance he! out of them. MI. Gleenstleet.
Say. Sydney. doesn't that constitute mayhem?
Definitely. Peter.
And besides. it would be very gruesome.
Horrible sight.
Now. look. gentlemen.
It's only a figure of speech.
You know, like you'll say, you'll tear a guy limb from limb.
You wouldn't really tear a guy limb from limb.
Wouldn't we?
Oh. pardon me. sir...
...would you mind stepping outside with me to! a moment?
No. no. no. excuse me. gentlemen.
I gotta join my outfit.
All I wanted to ask him is to join me in a cigarette.
- He didn't trust us. Peter.
- No.
And we are such gentle people.
Ale we?
Hey, Sydney...
[SINGING] I'm gettin' eorns for my country
At the Hollywood Canteen
The hardest working junior hostess
You've ever seen
I'm doin' my bit down here
For Uncle Sam
I'm a patriotic iitterbug
Yeah. yeah. that's what I am
I'm gettin' cums for my country
You should see the pounds fly
I'm gettin' down the waistline
And I don't even try
I don't need a DuBarry
Or a Westmore course
'Cause my weight': been taken over
By the Army Air Force
We're not petite as sweet Joan Leslie
But then we never mind
When those Gls knock us out
We're glad that we're the healthy kind
The way those cowboys from the prairie
Expect us to sashay
I think I'd rather two-step
With their horses any day
We 're gettin ' corns for our country
Though the gain' is tough
When we think we can't go on
We find we can't get enough
So if you hear of a soldier
Sailor or Marine
Tell 'em to look us up
At the Hollywood Canteen
I used to be aesthetic. they say
Oh. yes. I was. really. I was
I loved the drama, art and the ballet
But the Theater Guild
Came over and said:
"Forget about Pavlova
Learn to cut a rug"
So now we're jitterbugs
I'm gettin' cums for my country
Though I'm really all in
In a week from now we'll be here
With our usual vim
So if you hail from the Bronx
Des Moines or Aberdeen
Come down and ask for us
At the Hollywood Canteen
MAN 1: Sing us a cowboy song.
MAN 2: “Don't Fence Me In.“
PATTI:
Well, all right.
[WHISTLES]
[SINGING] Oh, give me land, Iuts u! land
Under starry skies
Don't fence me in
Let me ride through the wide
Country that I love
Don't fence me in
Let me be by myself
In the evening breeze
And listen to the murmur
Of the cottonwood trees
Send me off forever
But I ask you. please
Don't fence me in
Just tum me loose
Let me straddle my old saddle
Underneath the Western skies
Doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
On my cayuse
Let me wander over yonder
Till I see the mountains rise
I want to ride to the ridge
Where the West commences
And gaze at the moon
Till I lose my senses
And I can't look at hobbles
And I can't stand fences
Don't fence me in
No
Papa. don't you fence me in
Look. Che? Milani. what I need now is some advice...
...from some of these romantic guys you got autographs of.
Well. is Paul Henleid and Donald Woods.
In the kitchen. see? They washing dishes.
Gentlemen.
You know. some guys are born with something inside them...
...that makes women melt.
You guys got it.
You ever see a woman melt, Paul?
Sure.
Why. every time Paul looks my way. my blood pressure climbs higher and higher.
You see. MI. Henleid? You got it.
Oh. that's because Mary Gordon stirs something subconsciously primeval in me.
Go on with you now. you'll have me blushing.
Subconsciously plime-- What?
“Eval." primeval.
- Prirneval?
-Certainly.
Haven't you heard. sergeant. that we were all animals once?
Yeah.
And in some ways we never got over it.
That's light.
Now. I think there is still some animal in every man and woman.
You don't say?
How does a man horse greet a female horse?
- They rub noses?
- That's light, they rub noses.
What does a man lion do if he sees a woman lion come into his jungle?
- They rub noses.
-That's right, sergeant, they rub noses.
And what do we do?
We are frustrated, we don't rub noses.
And do you know why. sergeant?
Because we are civilized.
We don't exercise our instincts anymore.
That's light.
More exercise is what we need.
When woman meets man today. what does she do?
- She don't rub noses.
- No.
But out of he! subconscious primeval background--
Ain't words wonderful?
--It doesn't matter whether the man is handsome or dances well...
...she knows he's he! man when she sees him.
Because she's still got he! animal instinct way down deep inside her.
Fascinating.
Sergeant, since you're wearing a South Pacific ribbon there...
...you might inject a little color of the tropics into your line too.
Like what?
Oh. something like:
“ln the far stretches of the South Pacific...
...beneath the gleam of the tropical moon,
I dreamed of this moment.“
Gentlemen.
I'm about to put your theory to work.
And may I say, furthermore, that you have my undying gratuity.
I hope he won't be caught with his instincts down.
Subconsciously primeval.
- Miss Alexis Smith.
- Hello.
What happens when a man horse meets a woman horse?
I haven't the vaguest idea.
Then what happens when a man lion sees a woman lion come into his jungle?
Well. I don't know. Does he roar?
No. he rubs noses. Miss Smith.
Sergeant. are you sure you're feeling all light?
I feel wonderful .
But what do we do?
We don't rub noses.
We are frustrated .
Well. aren't you glad we don't?
No.
Because we don't exercise our instincts enough.
Because way down deep inside. we got something primeval.
And. Miss Smith. when woman meets man today--
[MEN LAUGHING]
Tell us more. Sarge.
Yeah. what happens when man meets woman?
Go on. you muzzlels. hit the load.
I got a patent on this.
JIMMY:
We got Dennis Morgan here...
...to sing a song about you, you and you.
Dennis. how about the Yank number?
Sure. Jimmy. Excuse me. 'fellas.
I gotta give out with a song.
Speaking of what makes a nation as great as the U.S.A...
...I have made an observation. and I'm qualified to say:
[SINGING] You can always tell a Yank
By the way they call him Hank
By the way he talks and the way he thinks
And the way he likes to buy you drinks
You can always tell a Yank

By the way he shows that he's not afraid
To get up and call a spade a spade

Wants a Yankee Doodle deal
Wants his apple pie
And his constitution
He's the kind of guy
With a Int of sock appeal
And he hates to heil a heel

By the way he drives a tank
To defend a thing called democracy
And save the world from tyranny
You can always tell a Yank
You can always tell a Yank
By the way his glass will clank
With a guy from Rome and a guy from Pinsk
And a guy from Shanghai, Wales and Minsk
You can always tell a Yank
You can always tell a Yank
By his friends on either flank
There's a guy called Slim, a buy named John
A kid called Chang and his friend Ivan
You can always tell a Yank
He's the kind of guy
Wants a Yankee Doodle deal
Wants his apple pie
And his constitution
He's the kind of guy
With a Int of sock appeal
- And he hates to heil
- A heel, yeah
You can always tell a Yank
By the way he eats a frank
By the way he fights for the Bill of Rights
And the right to love a girl in tights
You can always tell a Yank
CHORUS'. You can always tell a Yank
By the way they call him Hank
By the way he talks and the way he thinks
And the way he likes to buy you drinks
You can always tell a Yank
You can always tell a Yank
By the way he hates a crank
By the way he shows that he's not afraid
To get up and call a spade a spade
You can always tell a Yank

To defend a thing called democracy
And save the world from tyranny
You can always tell a Yank
To get back to things primeval.
Miss Smith--
[MEN LAUGHING]
Make way 10! a guy with a theory.
MAN: Thank you very much 10! the dance.
- Thank you.
In the far stretches of the South Pacific. beneath the gleam of a tropical moon...
...I dreamt of this moment.
OI am I being too bold?
If you'll excuse me, I hate goodbyes.
Look, I'm the white sheep of my family.
Let's go someplace where we can talk?
We hostesses are not permitted to leave with the servicemen.
And besides.
I have to be at the studio quite early.
My life to this moment has been a total loss...
...because I ain't seen your beautiful puss in pictures.
Well. I work at the studios.
I wouldn't tum down an invitation to come to watch you work tomorrow.
Oh, I'm so sorry, but you see,
I give so much of myself to my art...
...there'd be so little left for you.
A crumb would be a banquet.
And besides. I'll be all tied up with Humphrey Bogart all day.
We're testing.
You passed my test the moment I laid my orbs on you.
Would you settle 10! a dance?
Would a starving man settle for a beefsteak?
I like these novelty bands that play music the way it was written.
Now. isn't there something about me that makes me stand out tlom these other guys?
Well. yes. now that you mention it.
Well. what is it?
Gee. I don't know. all a girl's got to go by is he! instinct.
That's ii, you got it!
You're subconsciously primeval!
[MEN LAUGHING]
NOLAN:
Luscious!
Good night, sergeant.
I have to save myself for my art, you know.
I have to report in San Francisco Monday.
I'd certainly like another...
...look at Miss Leslie before I go.
-I'll keep my fingers crossed for you.
SLIM: What's the matter, pal?
-l'rrl off women for the duration.
Isn't that an unfortunate attitude to have at the Hollywood Canteen?
Happens to be the way I feel. ma'am.
Look. this is the last dance tonight.
Shall we have it together?
Okay-
What's the kitten's name?
We've tried very hard to find a name 10! it.
Have you any suggestions?
How about...
Yes?
Anybody ever tell you you look like Joan Crawford?
Well. yes. my husband has.
- You dance good, light as a feather.
-Thank you.
- You're a dead-ringer for Joan Crawford.
-Arn I really?
Don't look now, but I am Joan Crawford.
You're--
- Joan Claw“?
- Yes.
Oh. somebody get some water.
Quick. he's fainted.
Joan Crawford .
[PEOPLE LAUGHING]
You know. Slim...
...when we was mildewing in the jungle.
I kind of resented these canteens...
...and the guys who were lucky enough to be here instead of there.
I won't resent it no more.
And I used to figure that Hollywood was a place with all false fronts.
Nothing false about them we seen tonight.
Gorgeous.
Yeah. she certainly is.
You know, I don't wanna get sloppy about this but it kind of got me.
All them famous people being friendly and democratic.
Democratic.
Democracy.
That's what it means. Slim.
Everybody equal, like tonight.
All them big shots listening to little shots like me...
...and being friendly.
- Slim.
- What's the matter?
- I danced tonight!
-Quiet!
No. look!
I don't need my cane no more!
Hey, hey. look! Listen. you guys!
[MEN GROANING]
Look. I got lid of my extra leg!
Look. will you!
[SINGING] I left my cane
At the Hollywood Canteen
I left my--
MAN 1: Quiet.
MAN 2: Go to sleep.
NOLAN: I didn't even miss it!
MAN 3: Quiet.
That's wonderful, sarge, wonderful.
It was that dame with the instinct that did it.
Something subconsciously primeval passed on betwixt us and I forgot my cane.
Why didn't you tell me. Slim?
I was thinking about something else.
I guess. I didn't notice.
There's nothing like a leg of your own to stand on.
Oh. that bread.
I could hire out just to stand here and drool.
SLIM:
It sure smells good.
Good old American ?owers.
- They sure top them jungle orchids.
- I'll say.
May I serve you?
No. ma'am. I'm just smelling.
Miss. have you got any of them flowers what eats ?ies?
WOMAN: You think that'd be appropriate to send to your girlfriend?
I don't send my girlfriends no ?owers.
I always say a good smack on the kisser pays off more.
Sell my pal a daisy. He wants to know whether he and his dream gill...
-...was meant 10! each other.
- One on the house.
- Thanks a lot. Oh. fine.
- See?
NOLAN: Say, look, that sign says passion fruit.
I didn't know it came that way.
What do you get for passion fruit?
- As fruit or as juice?
- You mean. you can take it like juice?
Well, most people do. A dollar a bottle.
Slim. give me one of my dollars. this I gotta try.
NOLAN:
Hey, look, your girlfriend.
SLIM:
Miss Leslie?
Oh. hello. are you shopping too?
No. ma'am. we're just looking.
You remember me?
Well. of course I do. you're Slim.
- I kissed you at the Canteen.
- I know.
L-- I-- I just want you to know that kiss.
It didn't put you under any obligations.
Oh. I understand.
But it sure was beautiful while it lasted.
- I'm glad you liked it.
- I sure did.
Miss Leslie.
I'd like you to meet Sergeant Nolan.
- How do you do. sergeant?
Greetings.
Do you want me to carry your vegetables to the car?
No. thanks. they're not very heavy.
Well, it-- It's wonderful seeing you again.
Thanks.
It's nice seeing you again too. Slim.
- Well. goodbye.
- Bye.
Oh. you Romeo.
You chicken-hearted Bo Peep.
“It was so beautiful while it lasted.“
Why didn't you get in there and pitch?
She said it was nice seeing me again.
Give me my bottle of passion-huh juice.
Here.
Johnny!
Number 999.822 just came through the door.
- Won't belong now. I gotta go back.
- Okay.
All light. sit down. everybody. sit down.
Sit down. that's the idea.
Now, you fellows in the back, sit down, will you, please? Thanks.
You know. this is the biggest night in the history of the Canteen so tar.
Around here we don't celebrate anniversaries in terms of months or years...
...but in terms of how many of you we've welcomed into this place.
Alan Hale just told me a number.
That means the millionth soldier or sailor or Marine...
...is gonna walk through that entrance and we wanna celebrate it.
While we're waiting. I'd like to give a quick run-through of how this place was born.
Bette Davis and the lest of us thought it'd be a good idea...
...if we found a place where we could say.
“Welcome to Hollywood," and. "Thanks.“
This is the place we found.
At first, it looked like a kind of an abandoned dump...
...so we sent a circular around to all the movie folks...
...and asked them to pitch in and help.
All the movie unions in town said,
"Okay. we're with you 100 percent."
First came the janitors.
...then came the carpenters, an Sundays and holidays...
...and then the electrician fixed the wiring.
Meanwhile, the set designers laid out blueprints and plans.
Then the painters came with their buckets and brushes and made the place like new.
And the studio artists painted the murals you see.
The signs came from the sign painters.
The trucking companies sent us trucks, and folks chipped in on chairs and furniture.
The musicians' union started lining up the music.
The planning committee had to keep way ahead.
Actresses, gatemen, cameraman, stenographers. directors...
...the whole motion-picture industry pitched in to help.
The girls from the studios volunteered to be junior hostesses.
They're not only actresses and secretaries and script girls. they're grand kids.
I can't finish this story without bringing to the mike...
...the lady who worked harder than anybody to bring this Canteen into being.
Our first president and still our president.
Get Bette Davis.
- Front and center.
-I have to go.
What? What is it?
Did the millionth man come?
- This is all 10! you.
- Well. what about?
Come on and say thanks.
I don't know what Johnny could have said to bring forth this very warm greeting...
...but whatever it was,
I'm perfectly sure I don't deserve it.
- Tonight is a big night here.
- I've already said that.
Have you?
What number's coming through?
What number is it, Alan?
Nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand. nine hundred and eighty-nine.
MAN: Nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand. nine hundred and eighty-nine.
JOHN: Will you make an aisle. fellas?
Just make an aisle so he can get through.
That's right, busboys, will you give us a hand?
That's the idea.
I see the millionth man. a sailor.
But these two babes from Lockheed said they'd be at the Palladium hot or cold.
I know. Joe. but...
Come on. Weenie.
All light. so they don't show up. we can come back.
What do you got to lose?
Ale you sure my chick': good-looking?
Redheaded.
Okay. the Palladium it is.
Like you say. what have we got to lose?
You'll be very sorry.
And you'll be very happy.
Allow me to be the first to congratulate you, soldier, and just step this way.
He's the millionth man.
Folks. the millionth man!
[BAND PLAYING FANFAHE]
It's Slim.
- Johnny. you arranged this.
- I swear it's on the level.
Gills. he's all yours.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- I've kissed you before.
-That's right.
You didn't know you were somebody special. did you?
No. ma'am. Am I?
Yes. you're the millionth man to enter the Hollywood Canteen.
Gee. that's“ Thai': a lot of men.
It is. and that's why we wanted to do something about it.
So we decided to let the man who was actually number 1 million...
...celebrate for all the rest, as an expression of our gratitude...
...to the men who have already come to the Canteen.
And to those we hope will continue to come until the war is over.
The studios and the merchants of Hollywood have contributed gifts...
...as a symbol of their appreciation.
And as the official representative of our first million men...
...Corporal Green, they're all for you.
There's a hotel suite reserved for you...
...there's a car waiting at the back door for you...
...there's an evening at any nightclub in town...
...and every studio has cordially invited you to visit them.
And last. but I don't think least...
...you may choose any actress in town as your date to! the weekend.
[MEN WHISTLING AND CHEERING]
Golly.
The millionth man's first words were.
“Golly.“
Did you mean I could have a date with Joan Leslie?
BETTE:
What do you say. Joan?
I'm flattered and honored to be chosen. Slim.
I'll try to show you a good time.
L-- Golly.
L-- I-- I can't believe it all.
We'll have your gifts sent over to the hotel, Slim.
I have a buddy out here.
Could he bunk in with me?
- Of course, what's his name?
-Sergeant Nolan. He's out here someplace.
Would the corporal's buddy please come up to the stage?
Me!
[BAND PLAYING]
- That's nice going. fella.
- Thank you.
Congratulations. Slim.
- Thanks.
Gee. all these congratulations.
It's just like a wedding.
Just like a wedding.
How'd you do in your test with Humphrey Bogart, beautiful?
Oh, they're crazy about me.
Mr. Bogart said he never got so much give from anybody.
What's “give“?
Well. it's how you look at someone...
...when somebody says something to somebody about something.
I know what you mean.
You got more give than I ever got.
- You're gonna be a star?
-Oh, I guess so.
They want me 10! a seven-year contract.
I'm only going to give them five.
- They're very upset.
-I know how they feel.
Wanting seven and only getting five.
I know just how they feel.
Joanie. how about singing a chorus with the band?
- All light. Jimmy. Do you mind?
- I'd love it.
[SINGING]

If you wanna look at me, save it for later, will you?
All light.

- Hello. Joan.
- Hello. Eleanor.
May I present Corporal Green?
We met at the Canteen. you're one of the gills I got kissed by.
Mm-hm.
I was on the first shift tonight.

SLIM: How are you?
-Eleanor told me about you.

- Joan. is this what it looks like?
- It's lice. Johnny threw--
- Well. congratulations.
MAN:

If they keep on with those flashlights,
I won't be able to see you.
- Shall we go on home instead?
- Let's.
- Miss Leslie. is the lice on the level?
- What do you think?
PHOTOGRAPHER:
I guess it is.
This is where I live.
Oh, the folks are at the movies.
- How can you tell?
- We have a signal.
When that light's on. that's where they are.
I don't think they'd like it...
...if they came home and found just us in the house.
Well. couldn't we just sort of stand out here and talk?
Maybe we could talk better out in back.
There's a place to sit down there. Okay?
Oh. swell.
You'd better hold my hand so you won't stumble.
[DOG BARKING]
- That dog sounds like he has asthma.
- He's mine. and he hasn't.
[CLATTERING]
JOAN: Oh. I was just going to warn you about that garbage can.
Was it empty. I hope?
It feels like I got some coffee grounds in my pants.
Oh. I'm sorry. Slim.
- Quiet, Wooly.
-What'd you say?
Oh. I was just talking to my dog.
- Nice Wooly. Nice dog.
- Good boy.
This is my friend Slim.
- Oh. Wooly. get away.
- Nice boy.
Here-- Here's a stick, I'll get it.
Come on, Wooly, come on.
Go get it.
You all light?
I don't usually go around falling over things like this.
Oh. that's all light, you couldn't help it.
You'll feel safer when we sit down.
Oh. Slim.
Dam ii. my sister put out the croquet set.
Ale you hurt?
Maybe I'd better crawl to the swing.
- Guess I'm just not the romantic type.
- I think you are.
I wish I was. with you.
This is wonderful.
Do you sit here often with fellas?
Oh. not very often. Why?
Oh. I just wondered.
I guess I'm jealous of every guy that ever sat anyplace with you.
Oh. don't think of things like that.
You're my date.
Let's pretend that we've gone together to! a long time.
- Well. maybe if I sat a little closer?
- Mm-hm.
What were we talking about?
About pretending we'd gone together a long time.
- We have. if dreaming counts.
- Oh. it does. it counts a lot.
I dreamed of you after you kissed me.
You dreamed of me? Honest?
Honest. Shouldn't I have?
Oh. of course you should.
Why. I mean--
Well, I think it's wonderful that you'd take the time to dream of me.
What with you and everything.
Dreams don't take much time.
Sometimes they're fun.
I know.
You know. I used to dream about you in New Guinea.
I was having a wondeliul dream about you once when the Japs came over.
Oh, what an awful way to put an end to a dream.
It didn't end there. it just started.
It's going on light now.
You're nice. Slim. I like being with you.
Remember what you said about pretending we'd gone together a long time?
Mm-hm.
Well. if we had. I wouldn't have been sitting way over there where I was.
I'd be sitting light here.
Just like this?
Not exactly. I'd--
I'd have my arm around you too.
10! instance.
All light. let's just sit that way. to! instance.
Wow.
What's the matter?
I can't believe it's me sitting here with my arm around you.
[HUMMING]
Heal the mail plane?
That isn't the mail plane.
It's my heart beating.
Oh.
[CAR APPROACHING]
It's my folks.
I wouldn't want them to meet me with coffee grounds on my pants.
You go out the back way. then. come on.
I'm-- I'm sorry. Slim.
So am I.
Gee, I wanted tonight to be different than this.
Me too.
[FOOTSTEPS]
Aren't you going to kiss me good night?
That makes up 10! everything.
Good night, Slim.
Good night.
- Good morning. gentlemen.
WOMAN: May we come in?
Usually a man waiter does this, but they're in defense factories or fighting someplace.
I always say a woman's place is in the hotel loom.
Ale you really married to Joan Leslie?
Holy smoke!
This is awful, it-- it isn't fair to her. She won't like this.
This is terrible.
Oh. I'm sorry. ladies.
You'd better get out of here.
Slim.
- You're gonna ask her to marry you.
-What do you mean? I wouldn't dare.
What have you got to lose?
Go on. ask her.
All light. all light. so you don't have to ask he! to many you.
Grapefruit?
Why. MI. Warner sent wold down that the whole studio is yours.
He even sent our prettiest messenger gill to guide you.
NOLAN: What? You said you were--
Messenger gill.
Huh.

ZACHARY:

JOAN: Obviously. else why would I wile you the money?
ZACHARY: Exactly. and now you know why
I sent it back. I'm no paid escort.
- You're just too proud.
-Do you think I'd humiliate you?
I'd lather be humiliated than disappointed.
ZACHARY: Then this may be news to you.
I've chucked architecture.
Because after six years of work and study...
...it still won't pay my train lave to visit the gill I love.
JOAN:

-We're glad to see you.
Yes. I've looked forward to meeting you.
I guess you didn't like what was in the papers, sir.
Joan explained.
Sit down?
You know the old saying.
“Say it with ?owers.“
What does that mean?
Oh. you know.
If you love somebody. you--
I bet you wish she'd hurry up.
I'll get her.
- I see you have the Purple Heart there.
- Yes. sir.
I was in the wrong place when a shell exploded.
You know. son. I think I'm beginning to understand what Joan sees in you.
Oh, how awful, you had to face the family without me.
It wasn't half as bad as I thought it was going to be.
Well. I mean-- That is--
Oh. you know what I mean.
Yes. deal. we know what you mean.
Come along. Father. and carve the ham.
We'll give Joan a night off.

- Would you like me to put them in water?
- Would you. please?
- Sure.
-Thanks.
Do you like them?
They like you too. I could tell by their eyes when I came in.
Think they could tell from my eyes how crazy I am about you?
You say the darndest things. Slim.
It's gonna take a long time getting used to you.
I wish we had a long time.
Deal heavenly Father. we thank thee...
...for all thy blessings on this house and on our loved ones.
Bless. we play thee. the guest at our table. watch over him and protect him.
And we play thee, O heavenly Father...

Amen.
Thank you. I feel very privileged tonight to be asked to introduce...
...one of the world's greatest violinists.
He's in town 10! the Philharmonic.
MI. Joseph Szigeti.
Thank you. boys and gills.
We are going to play “The Bee“ by Flangois Schubert.
Thank you. MI. Szigeii.
- It's been a happy experience.
- Thank you.
This is more or less of a classical evening here at the Canteen.
As you know. Mr. Szigeti represents the finest of the European school of violinists.
We also happen to have a man here tonight...
...who is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, American violinist.
[AUDIENCE MEMBERS LAUGHING]
Thank you. Miss Davis.
The nerve to play “The Bee.“
See. “The Bee“ was written exclusively
10! me by Flangois Schubert.
BETTE:
Well. do the best you can.
Oh. Jack. MI. Kaufman has generously consented to accompany you.
How nice.
Mr. Kaufman, I don't know how well you know MLSzigeti...
...but it just so happens that he practically stole the--
Oh, Mr. Szigeti, I'd like to introduce myself.
My name is Benny.
- Oh. yes. yes.
- Benny. the violinist.
America's foremost violinist.
Why. I thought you were a radio comedian.
Oh. I do dabble in radio occasionally. but music is really my racket.
And incidentally. I want to congratulate you on the rendition of “The Bee.“
- Thank you.
- Which I had intended to play.
Oh, I am sorry about that, but really if you had only spoken up--
Well, I wouldn't worry about it...
...because I have other numbers up my sleeve too. brothel.
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]
Hm.
But, Mr. Szigeti, I was just thinking, instead of playing a violin solo...
...it might be a lather good idea if we played a duet together.
Why. that could be lather amusing.
Is there anything in particular you would care to suggest?
Oh. I don't care. you suggest something. anything.
It really makes no difference.
How about:
“The Introduction and Rondo Capliccioso“ by Saint-Saéns?
Oh. the “Ca-- The Capliccio“ Oso.“
Yes, I could take the “introduction“...
...and you do the “Capliccioso.“
Oh. I would do the “Capliccio-J'?
Yes. yes. yes.
Well. you see...
...that number never seemed to get anywhere.
I mean. people don't hum it.
How would you like to play--?
I have a suggestion.
How would you like to play.
“Love in Bloomioso“?
-“ Bloomioso“ ?
- Yes.
Well. I don't think
I've ever heard that one.
He's supposed to be the world's greatest violinist.
Well, then maybe something else.
How about “Souvenir“?
“Souvenir“? Which “Souvenir“?
- The what?
SZIGETI: Which “Souvenir“?
- Which?
SZIGETI: Whose?
- Whose? -Any “ Souvenir .
I don't care as long as--
“Souvenir.“
We could play “The Souvenir.“
Oh. that one I haven't played in years.
I haven't played it since I was that high:
Oh. good. good. Well. shall we tune up?
- Let's tune up.
- All light. sir.
A? Could I have A. please?
No. no. A. A.
Just a second.
Mr. Kaufman, could I have A, please?
[AUDIENCE APPLAUDING]
[PIANO PLAYING]
I'll take it now.
[SQUEAKS]
It's an old violin.
[SCHATCHING]
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]
Do let me finish.
Honestly, folks, can you tell the difference?
[SC RATCHES]
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]
Hi. pal.
- Where's Joan?
- At a radio rehearsal.
She's meeting us here at 9:30 to take us to the train.
It she's taking you to the train.
I got scientific plans. See you later.
Someday we may have a millionth junior hostess.
Maybe then we gills can have our choice of you men 10! a weekend date.
- I think that'd be jolly decent.
WOMAN: Whom would you pick?
Oh. I've already picked him. but he knows none of us gills...
...can make dates for when we leave, so he's safe.
I did so want to go up to Hollywoodland and discuss scientific things with him.
- Whele's Hollywoodland?
- Oh. up on top of everything. sergeant.
What of a scientific nature is there up there?
Well. that all depends on who's being scientific about what.
Well. I see. yes.
Suppose a fellow had an interest in things subconsciously primeval...
-...and he was up there?
- He'd have to take a taxi to get there first.
Suppose he took a taxi?
He wouldn't know where to tell the taxi drivel to go. would he?
What's the pool guy gonna do?
Well. I suppose all he can do. since it's 9:00...
...is to go to the comer of Sunset and
Cahuenga Boulevard and get in a cab there.
And then what?
Well. if he waits long enough...
...maybe somebody will come along and snuggle light in beside him...
...and tell the drivel where to go.
What it there's nobody nice enough to do all that?
I think there will be.
Yes. but how can you tell. old gill?
Well. it's merely a matter of instinct. old boy.
[NOLAN HUMS]
And a little science helps sometimes.
Well, end of my shift, bye. Miss me.
Charming people, quite odd.
I haven't the vaguest idea...
...what they were talking about, have you?
- No.
- No.
ANNOUNCER:
Fellas. here he is. Carmen Cavallalo.
Thank you very much.
And now. boys and gills. with your kind permission...
...we would like to play our version of “Voodoo Moon.“
Thank you very much.
And, now, folks, we have a great big surprise for you.
If you'll kindly move back and make a great big circle...
...and you gentlemen. please move the tables out here...
...we'll be very happy to present...
...the world's greatest
Spanish-Gypsy dancers:
Rosario and Antonio.
[ROSARIO SPEAKS IN SPANISH]
- Hey!
- Hey!
- Hey!
- Hey!
Tonight we have a very distinguished visitor.
Our millionth man.
Corporal Slim Green.
He told me that last night when he was chosen. he was too startled to speak.
Now he's found his voice and he'd like to say something.
So. gentlemen. your Iepleseniative.
Corporal Slim Green.
Fellas. I guess any of you who were here last night and saw...
...how I was lucky enough to be number
1 million were kind of ashamed of me.
All I said was “Golly.“
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]
I know I let you down.
That's why I wanted to come back up here before I shove off tonight.
I happened to be number 1 million...
...but I just represent every fella who's ever come here.
I might have been a soldier, a flier, a sailor of the British Commonwealth of Nations...
...or a Chinese air cadet, here to learn to fly.
I might have been one of our friends from Russia...
...of one of our own colored boys.
I might have come from the Philippines across the Pacific...
...or from down under, from New Zealand or Australia.
OI maybe been a Flee Frenchman.
I might have been one of the boys from South America.
Or from our next-door neighbor Mexico.
Or maybe escaped from Norway or the Netherlands or Denmark...
...of Greece or Poland or Czechoslovakia or any of the countries.
I might have been wearing kilts like a Scotsman...
...but believe me. if I was. you could see my knees shaking light now.
So I was all of you fellas rolled up into one when they made this short leave...
...in Hollywood into some kind of paradise 10! me.
We've seen people we've dreamed of. up close.
And we've found them all as real as they are famous.
They wait on us. they wash our dishes.
Gosh. they come up here every night to make us laugh or even choke up a little.
But whatever they do, they make us forget for a while...
...where we've been or where we're going.
Still. I think we'll remember longest. that most us arrived here lonely.
But after corning to the Canteen, we weren't lonely anymore.
So. Miss Davis, when I just said.
“Golly.“ last night...
...I was feeling as grateful as all the boys are.
Except that we can't put it into words.
So instead of saying. "Thanks." we just say. "Golly." and never forget.
Thank you. Slim.
You've given us something we'll never forget.
And wherever you go. our hearts go with you.
Thank you.
Come on. Slim. we'll miss our train.
You and the guys run along.
I'll meet you there. I've got a lilt.
Famous last words.
Slim.
I'd like to say goodbye and thanks.
-“Thanks." Miss Callisle?
- Mm-hm.
For letting us know that the things we do here ale important to you boys. appreciated.
Well. they certainly are. ma'am.
I'm supposed to sing now.
Any request before I go?
Well. Joan and I have got sort of a theme song.
-“Sweet Dreams, Sweetheart“?
- How'd you know?
I saw your face when she sang it for you.
Good luck.

[ENGLISH SDH]
This is the last of the trucks, lieutenant. We'll embark in four hours.
Give the men, oh, another hour at the party and then get them up fast.
Do you think they're having too much fun to sail for the States?
I think you're right.
- Good luck to you.
- Thank you.
- Okay, driver.
- Yes, sir.
Okay, Miller, out you go.
This infirmary's closed.
And you're going home along with the rest of us.
Yeah, that's right.
They finally found a ship for you.
It ain't the Queen Mary, but it floats.
Why don't you go to the party downstairs...
...and have some fun until it's time to leave?
Uh...
Listen, sonny boy, if you're too shy to go to a party...
...okay, don't go.
But don't kid me about this silly bandage.
You've been over the mumps for two days now and we both know it.
What's wrong with you anyway?
You don't talk, you don't make friends.
You don't whistle at me or any of the nurses.
You know, nobody even knows your first name.
Uh, Danny.
Danny.
If you was in love, I could understand it.
But you don't even have a pinup girl in sight.
Hey, it is love.
Well, what's the matter?
Can't I even take a look at your girl?
- That's the Brooklyn Bridge.
- Sure.
That's my pinup girl. Isn't she a beauty?
- But you're not from Brooklyn.
- You wanna bet?
Listen, I'm from Brooklyn, so don't tell me.
I know what Brooklyn guys are like and they're not like you.
Well, I can't help that, but that's where I'm from.
Go ahead, ask me some questions about it.
Go ahead, ask me, why don't you?
Where is the Loew's Met?
Nevins Street.
Prospect Park?
Eastern Parkway.
Ebbets Field?
Bedford and Sullivan.
So there.
You could've read it in a book.
But if it is true, then you really ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Hiding like a rabbit in a hole.
Why aren't you at that party like a Brooklyn guy...
...making friends for yourself and for
Brooklyn? A Brooklyn guy is a friendly guy.
Well, I will be once I get home.
It's easier in Brooklyn.
I don't care how many photographs you got, don't care how many streets you know.
When I see you out making a friend, then I believe you're from Brooklyn.
Hey, now, fellas, now come on, cut it out.
- How you doing, pal?
- Shh.
Brooklyn.
Shh!
Good, huh?
Flat. Flat as yesterday's beer.
Hey, hey, bud, do you know
"Whose Baby Are You?"
"Whose Baby Are...?" No, no, I'm frightfully sorry, I don't, but...
Never mind. Forget it.
Say, say, I know that song.
You mind if I give you a small rundown?
No, not at all. Sit down.
Baby, baby
Whose baby are you?
Baby, baby
Whose baby are you?
Well, that sounds more like
Mendelssohn's Italian Symphony.
Sure, the notes are the same, but it hasn't got a beat.
- A beat?
- Yeah, you know, a beat.
Oh, no, I'm afraid I haven't got that.
Look, why don't you take over?
- Wait, I don't wanna crab your act.
- Oh, I'm rather relieved.
I was supposed to be entertaining, but I'm hardly succeeding.
Good night.
Hey, fatso, go on, hit it.
- Hey, fellas, chow.
Chow!
Let's get that, boys.
Brooklyn.
Do I understand that you're from Brooklyn?
Why, yes, as hard as it may be to believe.
No, no, quite the contrary.
You're so friendly.
It's only in Brooklyn that people are as friendly as that.
Just a second, with that accent you're not gonna tell me you're from Brooklyn.
No such luck. No, that was Mama.
She was born there.
Well, how do you like that?
My name's Danny Miller.
She came to England when she was quite a child...
...but she talked about Brooklyn all her life.
That's how I guessed that you were from Brooklyn.
The moment that you tried to help that young man in there.
The square? The guy that was playing?
- I didn't do very much.
- But you had such poise.
I did?
Such confidence, such self-assurance.
- I did?
- It was wonderful.
Well, I guess that's the way it is with all us guys from Brooklyn.
I know.
That's why I'm going to ask a favor.
That young man is my grandson,
Jamie Shellgrove.
- Oh, gee, I didn't mean to say any...
- No, no.
He is a square.
He's shy, can't talk to people, doesn't have fun.
And the music he writes...
That stuff he was playing, that sounded good.
It isn't young.
Everything he writes sounds just like a funeral march.
That's why I thought that if you were to talk to him...
Me? Oh, now wait a minute, Dad...
A little advice from someone like you, sure of himself.
Forceful and...
Why, I know that you could help him.
Honest, Dad,
I think you've got the wrong guy. I...
Sure, I'd be very happy to give him a few pointers
- Any time you say.
- Thank you, Danny.
We live just across the garden.
- Are you the caretaker here?
- Well, sort of.
Oh, I wish that Jamie were a little bit more like you.
You should see him trying to talk to a girl. It's gruesome.
That's what it is, gruesome.
And here's Danny, going back to Brooklyn.
Been away four years and yet he knows that in two weeks...
...he'll find exactly the sort of girl he wants.
Won't you, Danny?
Well, that's right, Pop.
But that's in Brooklyn.
And in Brooklyn, you know, it's easier.
Well, it wouldn't be easier for me.
It is difficult for me to talk to people.
That's unfortunate.
And as if you and Grandfather seem to think there's something missing in my music...
...it's because it's missing in me.
And I'm afraid that I'd be exactly the same in Brooklyn or anywhere.
Look, Jamie, about anywhere I don't know, but in Brooklyn...
...in one week's time, you'll be talking to a girl.
A girl? Ten girls.
You'll have your pick of 10 girls.
- Ten?
- Mm-hm.
- Stimulating town, what?
- Rather.
And that's not all. In two weeks, you'll be writing a new kind of music.
Music that sings.
In three weeks' time you'll be taking it to a publisher and having it played.
But that's in Brooklyn.
Of course.
That's what you need, Brooklyn.
You send him over to me. I'll fix him up.
You won't know him when I get through with him.
Gee, I gotta go.
- Bye, Danny.
- It's too bad.
I got some good ideas.
But that was the signal.
- You've been awfully kind.
- And thanks, thanks very much.
Don't forget, if you have any trouble send him over to me.
I'll take care of him, fix him, straighten him out.
I'll make him the greatest so...
"Duke of Dunstable. "
- Hey, buddy, where you going?
- Newark.
- You can catch a train there for anyplace.
- Oh, that's too slow, much too slow.
Can this cab take me to the bridge, the Brooklyn Bridge?
Mister, this cab will take you anyplace you wanna go. Come on, get in.
Hold it, hold it, stop.
This is it, here it is.
Isn't she a beauty?
Isn't she a queen?
Nicest bridge that I have ever seen
Her paint's a little tattered
Where age has left its touch
Still I guess I'll always love her
very much
Like the folks you meet on
Like to plant my feet on
The Brooklyn Bridge
What a lovely view from
Heaven looks at you from
The Brooklyn Bridge
I love to listen to the wind Through her strings
The song that it sings for the town
I love to look up
At the clouds in her hair
She's learned to wear like a crown
If you've been a rover
Journey's end lies over
The Brooklyn Bridge
Don't let no one tell you
That I've been trying to sell you The Brooklyn Bridge
All the folks in Manhattan are sad
'Cause they look at her
And wish they had
The good old Brooklyn Bridge
Heavens to Betsy.
What's the matter with you, silly?
Wanna get yourself killed?
Is that what Eisenhower taught you?
You slaphappy or something?
No, I'm just happy, that's all.
Happy? Sonny, you're in Brooklyn.
Yeah, isn't it wonderful?
Soldier, you've been away a long, long time. You just get in?
Yeah. Just got out too.
You're glad to be in Brooklyn when you could be over there in New York?
New York?
That's a place to look at Brooklyn from.
Say, I've gotta find an armory.
There's one over on Grand Street.
Take the bus on the next corner and get off at Jay Street...
...being sure to ask the conductor for a transfer.
- Then you take the Jay Street trolley...
- No, no, no.
I want the 14th Regiment Armory.
Oh, well, in that case,
I gotta blow me whistle.
Officer, I wasn't doing more than 30.
Young lady, two blocks back, did you or did you not go through a red light?
Everybody goes through it.
Shouldn't be a stoplight there at all.
Nevertheless, do I give you a ticket for it...
...or do you give this here soldier a lift to the 14th Regiment Armory?
- Good luck, sonny.
- Gee, thanks very much.
- I'll see you around, huh?
- Won't be here.
It's my last day.
Tomorrow, the New York side where I belong.
Brooklyn's where they send the bad policemen.
Nice day, isn't it?
There aren't any nice days in Brooklyn.
Don't you like it here?
Does anyone?
Sure. I do.
I've been homesick for this place for four years now.
People get homesick for some pretty terrible places.
Did you just get back?
Back and out.
All I gotta do is reregister for the draft and I'll be a civilian again.
Oh. That's why you're going to the armory?
I didn't know you had to reregister so soon.
Within 10 days. I wanna get it over with.
I'll be going back to work pretty soon and I may not have time.
You know, life here in Brooklyn's pretty fast, and I imagine...
...that I'll be swept up in the social whirl, hey.
Well, here you are.
Look, I can't tell you what it means to me to meet a small, dark-haired girl...
...with a turned-up nose on my first day back in Brooklyn.
It's kind of like a good omen.
Not that I didn't think everything was gonna be wonderful...
...but now I'm positive. Thanks.
Wait till the Dodgers get him.
Ladies and gentlemen, you're not setting a very good example...
...for our little guests from P.S. 65.
They must be back at their own school in about an hour, so let's settle down now.
Does anyone know why Johann Sebastian Bach...
...is called the father of modern music?
On account of counterpoint, natch.
Suppose we try this two-part invention, shall we?
Leo, will you start the introduction, please?
Yes, Miss Fielding.
Now, I'm going to signal each group when to come in.
Ready?
Johann Sebastian Bach in 1685
Wrote the kind of music that has
Kept his memory alive
- I beg your pardon.
- Yes, may I help you?
Yes, ma'am.
I was told at the armory that I could reregister here for the draft.
Just down the hall and turn to your right.
Thank you very much.
You can tell it's Bach
Because the counterpoint
Will tire each joint in every finger
In each hand
He pioneered in modern composition
And to his everlasting fame
And he's held in awe
By every great musician
Johann Sebastian Bach's his name
Time and time we've had it
Brought to our attention
That he was the father
Of two-part invention
If in class you've followed me
You've learned to know
The two from three
This is a Bach invention
I have brought to your attention
This is Bach's two-part invention
All proposed
By Johann Sebastian Bach
All by Johann Sebastian Bach
We said Johann Sebastian Bach
The great Johann Sebastian Bach
John Sebastian
John Sebastian Bach
Was his
Name?
Leo, will you please take over?
Will you kindly step into the corridor?
- Wasn't it funny, my meeting you here?
- I don't think it's funny at all.
Think of all the places there are in Brooklyn.
Oh, yes, indeed, it's an amazing coincidence.
Congratulations.
But will you leave now, please?
Oh, sure, yeah.
I guess I was disturbing the kids.
On the contrary, it was the teacher you were disturbing.
You mean you're angry?
Oh, I suppose you think
I should be flattered.
No.
There must be something in that mind of yours...
...to have made you follow me half across the city.
Very clever of you to have found me too.
I didn't follow you.
You didn't?
No, you see, I was looking for someone, but it wasn't you.
- Oh.
- See, I registered here for the draft...
...because I went to school here.
Now I've got to reregister.
- I'm sorry I bothered you.
- Well, look, you...
You do see what I thought, don't you, and why?
Oh, sure, it might've been true.
I could've followed you.
As a matter of fact,
I wanted to follow you.
But I'm glad I didn't...
...because you're a very mean girl.
Look, when you've made a mistake...
...all you can do is admit it and say you're sorry.
And, well, I'm very sorry.
Then it's okay.
Brother, you really got sore, didn't you?
Well, so did you.
I wouldn't have if this had been anyplace but Brooklyn.
Everyone's supposed to be friendly here.
You should get over those ideas of yours about Brooklyn.
No one is friendly here.
Everything is horrible.
No nails.
Fifty times I told you, no nails in the wall.
Cossack! Gestapo! Stool pigeon!
Sticks and stones will break my bones, but no nails.
Hey, Nick, aren't you gonna say hello to a guy?
- Have we been introduced?
- Formally.
I'm Danny Miller.
Don't you remember me?
- Come stai?
- Molto bene.
Sure, I remember you.
You're the kid who used to draw them awful pictures of me on the school building.
But you know something?
I could never get sore.
They looked just like me.
Now look at you in a uniform, like a hero.
I just got back today.
And you came here? To see me?
Just to see me?
Well, how do you like that?
Little girl, run along and put up your posters or you'll be late for the next class.
Only, try and make just one hole for each one, huh?
Yes, Nick.
Gee, mister, you've got talent.
Cossack. Huh!
You know, speaking of talent, you've got lots of it in that music room.
Not excluding the teacher.
Miss Fielding here, she sings like a nightingale.
Yes, I heard. You know, Miss Fielding, you should be in opera.
That's what she keeps telling the man at the opera house.
Only the man at the opera house keeps saying no.
- So I gave it up.
- Oh, you didn't.
Oh, I did. Well, Mr. Miller, goodbye.
And I hope you prove
I'm wrong about Brooklyn.
- See you around sometime, huh?
- I guess so.
It looks like I'll be here the rest of my life.
Uh, listen, up to now I never had a chance to listen to anybody's war experience.
What do you say?
I got a little flat down in the basement.
We could have some red wine, some garlic toast.
You like garlic toast?
Sure, I love it. First, I've gotta reregister for the draft.
Oh, that's in Room 31.
Then I'd like to find some clothes and a place to live.
Then how about supper?
No, that's no good.
It's your first night home.
I can't think of anyone
I'd rather spend it with.
I have no family.
- No girl?
- Uh-uh.
- Not at all?
- Not yet.
It's one of my ambitions, though, soon as I settle down.
Well, speaking as one who never got one, a girl is what you should get first.
Then if you don't get nothing else, it doesn't matter.
You still got her. See you later, huh?
Sure, and thanks, Nick.
Hi.
- Hello.
How do you like my new London drape?
Comes direct from Carnahan's Swap Shop on Atlantic Avenue.
- You cold, Danny?
- Hm?
Oh, no. The smart set just isn't wearing shirts this season, old thing.
Little common, you know?
Oh, couldn't find one, huh?
Come on, I'll lend you one.
Say, Nick, you got it fixed up swell.
I always say either you got a feeling for homemaking or you ain't.
A beauty, eh?
Gee, thanks, Nick.
The collar has only been turned over once.
- Can you keep a secret, Danny?
- Sure.
You see that doily?
I knitted that myself.
That's just between us.
I always feel better in the kitchen.
Maybe it's because I was born in one.
My mother being busy cooking spaghetti at the time.
And speaking of spaghetti...
...could you make...? Could you make like this is one of them fat calves...
...they're always getting out to welcome people home?
Mm! There isn't a calf in the world smells that good.
I'm glad to hear you say that.
But tell me...
...how did you make out today?
After I got reregistered, I didn't have much time to look for a place to live.
And what little time I did have,
I couldn't find one.
Oh, well, I'll go to a hotel.
A hotel?
Why, the man don't know what he's saying.
Sonny, there hasn't been a hotel room or a flat open in Brooklyn in years.
People have to live someplace.
Sure. They're living in gutters, in tents, in trees, in powder rooms.
Why, even the cemeteries are crowded.
And the crowds ain't all dead.
I lived in one myself behind Otis J. Fuller, 1810 to 1850...
...for five days.
And at the Museum of Natural History on Eastern Parkway...
...there's a family by the name of Snyder living under a brontosaurus.
That's a prehistoric animal.
Those Snyder babies are growing up thinking the sky is made out of bones.
A hotel? You're staying here with me.
Honest, Danny, you'd be doing me a favor.
It gets pretty lonesome sometimes.
Okay, that's settled.
Oh, but, Nick, I, uh...
Mr. Chips, a houseguest we got, and that calls for some celebration.
That's Mr. Chips, you know, from Goodbye, Mr. Chips.
His real name is Mr. Donat.
You're pretty sold on this guy, aren't you?
I like him because all the kids were crazy about him.
I seen the picture 11 times.
I even read the book.
But nowhere does it say why they liked him so much.
That's easy to figure.
For example?
Well, why do the kids in this school like you?
They don't. That's my affliction.
I like them but they don't like me.
I like you, Pop.
To your health, Danny. Welcome home.
As soon as I close the windows in the gymnasium, we eat.
Wait, I'll go with you, Pop.
After you, mine guest.
After you, mine host.
Are you all right?
How did you get in here?
Through the window, natch.
He's always trying to sneak in here.
All you gotta do is leave a window or a door open, and right away he's in.
But why?
What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?
He's a little fella, littler than the others.
And he keeps trying to exercise so he'll grow.
Well, gee, that's swell.
Only I don't grow. So, what's the use?
You've got ants? You can't wait?
Don't worry, son. You'll grow.
But how do I know?
Well, look, you just can't wish for things alone.
- You've gotta work for them.
- And work hard.
Some things you just don't get a written guarantee with.
Listen to Danny.
You see, you gotta believe certain things.
I believe a lot of things I can't prove.
Like what?
Well, like, uh...
I believe, I believe
I believe in wishing wells
And I also believe in a lot of things
Things the daisy tells
I believe, I believe
That a four-leaf clover brings
Lots of luck, lots of joy
Lots of happiness
I believe these things
And when it's Christmas
I believe in Santa Claus
Why do I believe?
I guess that I believe because
I believe, I believe
I believe that dreams come true
If you'll wish for the dream
By the wishing well
Don't tell the wish
Or you'll break the spell
It may sound naive
But that's what I believe
I believe, I believe
In the stars that sail the sky
I believe in the sign of the zodiac
Yes, and Gemini
I believe, I believe
That your luck will show again
If you manage to borrow a rabbit's foot
For your pocket chain
I knew a gypsy
And her skill with the cards was great
Once I held three kings
But they're no good against a straight
I, I believe
That it's all within your heart
Once you've learned how to smile
With an empty purse
You're richer than all the universe
Rainbows up your sleeve
And that's what I believe
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm 6-foot-2
I believe I can break any guy in half
Any guy like you
I believe, I believe
I'm as charming as can be
I can see all the girls in the neighborhood
Running after me
Aladdin had a lamp
He rubbed it quite a lot
I don't need a lamp
I only need the faith I've got
I believe, I believe
I believe the world is mine
Oh, I don't like to brag but I feel I can
Out-super men like the Superman
It may sound naive
But that's what I believe
You didn't get the job, huh?
For two weeks I've been trying to get up enough courage to see my old boss.
Today I saw him. And he was swell too.
I told him I didn't wanna be a shipping clerk anymore...
...that I wanted to sell the music, and he said:
"Fine. All you gotta do is audition for the job...
...and if you're good enough, it's yours. "
So you sang for him, huh?
No, I didn't even bother to try.
It's no use, Nick.
Whenever I have to sing before strangers,
I just freeze up.
I'll just be a shipping clerk.
Oh, Danny, don't say that.
Don't worry. It'll be all right.
Well, I gotta clean the music room.
Are you just gonna sit there?
Yeah, I got some thinking to do, Pops.
Don't worry about me.
Worry about you? Ha!
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be great.
Oh, Leo, that was beautiful.
Do you know you have a great future?
Yeah.
Working in my mother's candy store.
Oh, but surely you plan to go on with your music.
Perhaps if someone spoke with your mother.
Mom doesn't need any talking to.
She's dying because I can't go on studying.
Look, it's tough on her working in that store alone.
When I graduate in June, it's gotta stop.
But, Leo, if you kept on with your music...
...someday you could do so much more for her.
Yeah. But what happens between now and someday?
- Hey, Leo.
- Yeah?
Excuse me for butting in.
Can't you get one of them scholarships someplace?
They just take care of your tuition at music school.
I'd still need books and clothes and a decent piano.
And I can't let Mom go on working
15 hours a day to get them for me.
It's my turn to help her.
But doesn't the Brooklyn Music Forum give a scholarship that includes money...
...and quite a lot of money?
Yeah, that scholarship comes up every five years.
They're giving it this year, just a couple of weeks away.
Well, that's wonderful.
You're gonna try for it, of course.
No. You have to be 17 to be eligible.
I'm only 16 and a half.
Gee, I wish I could help you.
What's the use of talking?
I can't even help myself.
For two years now,
I've been trying to get a new mop.
Annie, what about you?
You didn't mean it when you said you were giving up singing.
Didn't you do good at them auditions?
Oh, all right, I guess.
Only the man said my voice was cold.
What does that mean?
That you need more schmaltz?
I don't know, Nick.
How do you warm up a cold soprano?
I wish I knew.
Well, it's not that tragic.
So I'm a little miserable.
Leo is miserable and everybody in Brooklyn is miserable.
By the way, how is your protégé,
Mr. Miller?
Miserable.
Not getting that job knocked all the bounce out of him.
Oh, that's too bad.
You know, maybe he should do something to raise his spirit...
...like go dancing or go to the movies or something like that.
Oh, Annie, would you?
Oh, Nick, I couldn't.
I haven't even been asked.
He wouldn't have the nerve, but I'm asking.
If you just dropped in for a minute, say, after supper.
Why, just your coming in to see him would puff him right up.
He thinks you're stupefying.
He's awfully low, Annie. Honest.
Well, what time do you finish supper, Nick?
Hey, Nick, don't you do those dishes without me.
You don't have to help me.
I like dirty dishes.
That's very pretty.
Isn't it, though? That's Jamie's music.
I put some words to it coming over on the boat.
Time after time
I tell myself that I'm
So lucky to be loving you
So lucky to be
The one you run to see
In the evening
When the day is through
I only know
What I know
The passing years will show
You've kept my love so young
So new
And time after time
You'll hear me say that I'm
So lucky
To be loving you
That's very nice.
You feel better now, huh?
Yeah, sure.
I kind of gave myself a good talking to.
You see, I kept thinking how different things would be when I got back.
Of course, the only thing
I didn't figure was me...
...that I'd be the same guy
I was when I left.
A little guy not sure of very much.
Maybe someday I'll be a big guy. Until then I'll take the shipping-clerk job.
Oh, Danny.
I'll be the greatest shipping clerk you ever saw, and I'll like it too.
Because you don't get what you want doesn't mean it's no good.
Yeah, that's right.
You know somebod...?
You know somebody
I'd wish you'd talk to?
- Annie.
- Anne Fielding?
Yeah, she's given up singing on account of they say her voice is cold.
And of top of that, she hates her job.
Teaching kids?
How can anyone hate teaching kids?
It ain't what she wanted.
She's pretty miserable.
I got a feeling she just goes home and sits.
Like she's hiding from everybody.
Oh, that's no good.
She's gotta get out more often...
...and go to parties or a dance or a movie or something.
That's what I keep telling her.
I think if you'd talk to her, she might listen to you.
She likes you.
She thinks you're stupefying.
- Oh, now wait a minute.
- Well, she asked me about you.
Could it be that you asked her about me?
Believe me...
Believe me, she asked me first and, uh...
The doorbell. I wonder who that could be.
It could be Miss Fielding, coming to cheer up the Lonely Hearts Club.
It could be.
And if it is, it's like with good intentions.
So nobody will act like a stinker.
Don't worry, Pop. Nobody will.
- Hello, Nick.
- Why, Annie, what a surprise.
I thought I'd drop in and beg a cup of coffee.
Beg a cup of coffee?
Why, you can have the coffee and the coffee pot.
Look, Danny, company.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Oh, Annie, excuse me.
I gotta go close the windows in the gym.
Uh, uh, uh...
But, Danny, the windows.
But, Nick, the company. Aren't you gonna ask Miss Fielding to sit down?
Oh, sure. Annie, won't you sit down?
We have some fresh coffee on the stove.
I'll get you some.
Oh, well, here we are.
I hear Brooklyn isn't turning out quite as well as you expected.
I know it's discouraging, but don't be depressed, after all...
Look, Miss Fielding, you're awfully nice, but please don't worry about me.
I'm doing fine.
From what Nick tells me, you're the one that's been going to pieces.
Hating your job and giving up your singing.
Why, you ought to be ashamed.
Maybe they're right about your voice.
Shh! Danny, Danny.
If you hate teaching kids, that's probably why your voice is cold.
Maybe it'd warm up if you took some interest in them instead of just yourself.
You know, most people want something and they're never happy until they get it.
And instead of enjoying themselves while working to get what they want...
...they go around being miserable all the time.
And that's what you're doing.
That's your trouble.
Oh, so that's my trouble, is it?
I suppose you're the person to straighten me out.
This ain't turning out just right.
What about you and your dreams of Brooklyn?
What are you doing?
You're just sitting here sulking.
- I've decided what to do now.
- Tell other people how to run their lives...
...because it's easier than running your own? Thank you very much.
Oh, Nick, I'm sorry. Good night.
All I've got to say is "wow. "
You know, you might be good for her singing.
You made her awfully mad.
Hmm. Would you say offhand
I made a very good impression?
She'll be back to apologize.
I give her 10 minutes.
- Uh-uh.
- You'll see. She likes you.
How can you tell?
What's the matter with you?
Haven't you never been to the movies?
Take the hero and the heroine.
How do they start out?
Fighting, like you and Annie.
Why? Because they won't admit they like each other.
Well, I admit I like her.
So all you gotta do is wait for her to admit it.
How long can you live?
What she's doing now is called fighting the heart.
In other words...
There ain't no other words. Ten minutes.
Two minutes.
- Nick, it couldn't be.
- No? Who do you think it is?
The Dukedom of Dunstable, maybe?
Come to see Brooklyn, the borough of your dreams.
I say, old boy, how do you do?
Perhaps you don't remember me.
Sure, sure I do. Jamie, come on in.
- What are you doing here in Brooklyn?
- Well, I just...
How's Pop? I mean, how's the duke?
Very well, thank you.
Gee, it's good to see you.
Let me look at you.
It don't look like Annie to me.
Jamie, this is Nick Lombardi, my best friend.
Nick, this is Jamie Shellgrove.
From England?
The one who's gonna be a duke?
It's a pleasure to meet Your Dukedom's acquaintance.
That can't be right.
What do you call him?
Jamie. How do you do?
How do you do?
Boy, that's so classy.
Come on, sit down and tell us why you're here.
Oh, excuse me.
Oh, Danny, I'm terribly sorry.
Will you please forgive me?
I didn't mean anything I said.
You came back.
Gee, so much is happening to me today.
There's someone I want you to meet.
Anne, this is Jamie Shellgrove, my friend from England.
Jamie, this is Anne Fielding.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
I've heard a lot about you.
Danny cabled and said he'd met the most beautiful girl.
- Oh, Danny.
- Jamie just arrived today.
I'd better run.
You must have a great deal to talk about.
- Please don't...
- Please don't...
Did you ever...?
Did you ever run into a man by the name of Mr. Chips?
Come on, Nick. Let's all sit down.
Let's give Jamie a chance to tell us why he's here.
Okay. You and me will have a little talk later.
Well, I'm afraid that sending that cable was rather unwise of you.
Hearing how well you were doing...
...crystallized Grandfather's dissatisfaction with me.
Crystallized.
I'm living.
Don't your grandfather like you?
Like him?
Why, the duke's crazy about him.
Only he wishes I were more like Danny.
Like Danny?
Yes, you know, forceful, confident and effectual.
Effectual.
He has a very fine command of the English language.
Well, when your cable came, Danny, it started Grandfather thinking.
There I was, he said, muddling about with my music...
...and here you are, finding exactly the job of work you wanted...
...making friends, meeting people.
Oh, it made him very dissatisfied with me.
So?
So he remembered your last words.
- My last words?
- Yes, before you left.
"Send him over," you said to Grandfather,
"I'll straighten him out. I'll fix him up. "
That's what you said.
That's what I said.
Yes. So that's what he did.
So he sent you over to me to straighten you out, huh?
Well, what does he want done, eh, old chap?
I haven't the vaguest idea.
Danny, do you know?
Yeah, I know.
Can you do it?
You don't think for a moment that I have the slightest intention of imposing on you.
I'll stay in Brooklyn for a few days just to satisfy Grandfather.
Well, besides, I rather think I'd like it.
That would be fine.
Except that it wouldn't be so fine.
The old man's got a right to expect something to happen...
...because I told him it would, and he believed me.
Well, do you think you can do what he expects?
If I can't, at least I want him to know it's my fault and not Jamie's.
There are some things I told you...
Oh, Danny, I... I've got to be going.
And, well, I'm very happy to have met you and I do hope I'll see you again.
I hope you'll like Brooklyn too.
Oh, I love it. I love it already.
Good night, Nick.
Thank you for the wonderful cup of coffee.
It has been my pleasure, old girl.
I was gonna tell him the truth.
Why? Why not help him instead?
All he needs is a little loosening up, and that should be simple.
Don't you remember what you said a while ago?
That I can't even run my own life.
Remember what you said a little while ago?
Maybe it'd help if you took an interest...
...in someone else's problem instead of just your own.
Good night, Danny.
I say, old bean.
Nick.
I underslept.
What's the matter, Danny?
Him. Jamie.
How can I help him when he finds out what a bust I am?
Why don't you try for that job?
Why don't you try just once more?
If you sing Jamie's song like you sang it this afternoon...
...you'll murder them.
- Ah.
I know just what'll happen, Nick.
I'll find myself thinking,
"Who said you can sing?"
And there I'd be all alone.
And I'd be dead.
What if you wasn't alone?
What if I was with you...
...and you were singing to me, your friend, your pal?
Say, Nick, that might work out all right.
Sure it would.
With things as rotten as they are.
It can't be worse.
Would you be good enough to tell
Mr. Dobson I'm here to audition for him?
Would you be good enough to tell me your name?
You know very well...
Listen, sonny, tell him that
Daniel Webson Miller is here to see him.
Like a wounded swan.
Now all you gotta do is sing.
What's the matter? You scared?
Well, don't you think
I ought to be a little bit...
...with all this jive stuff around here?
What chance have I got with a ballad?
All the chance in the world.
It doesn't matter what you sing.
The important thing is, whatever you sing, it's gotta come from the heart.
Come with me.
It's a good thing I came along.
Take Crosby.
What made him the singer of the age?
- His voice.
- That helped.
But it was really his heart.
And Jolson, what put him over on the stage?
His voice?
You don't understand.
It's heart that made them all
It's the difference between the big
And the small
It doesn't have to be witty or smart
Just as long as it comes
From the heart
It doesn't have to be classic or art
Just as long as it comes
From the heart
Just put more heart into your voice
And you'll become the people's choice
Just make up your mind
From the start
That the song's gotta come
From the heart
Why, only last year the kids asked me to sing at their graduation exercises.
I did. But I made a ghastly mistake.
I didn't sing from the heart.
I sang from the nose.
- Well, how did it sound?
- I don't know.
The note hasn't come out yet.
Just make up your mind
From the start
That the song's gotta come
From the heart
I could use a longer piano.
Let's take the world's great love songs.
What makes everybody melt when they hear them?
Heart.
For example.
You see what I mean, Danny?
Now, try and follow me in this one.
Yeah.
Believe me, that's got heart.
Hey.
Hey!
Don't be afraid
You'll make the grade
Why, you can sing
As good as Bing
That's why I say when you start
That the song is gotta come
From the heart
Sing it, Danny. Make me proud.
Okay, Nick. Stand back.
It doesn't have to be witty or smart
Smile.
Long as it comes
From the heart
Keep going.
It doesn't have to be classic or art
Great.
Long as it comes
From the heart
The kid's murder.
I'll give them that
I'll give them this
I'll strut away
Boy, you can't miss.
Just put a star on my chart
They won't need this anymore.
Because the song's gonna come
From the heart
Don't work cheap.
- On opening nights
- On opening nights
- Your name in lights
- Your name in lights
Why we won't stop
Till you reach the top
We'll order our meals à la carte
That's expensive.
If the song comes
From the heart
We'll be tremendous
If the song comes
From the heart
They'll holler, "bravo. "
If the song comes From the heart
Heart
Miller.
That was wonderful.
You can start to work Monday morning.
Gee, thank you very much,
Mr. Dobson.
That's all right.
- What did I tell you?
- Oh, thanks, Nick.
Say, we ought to get Anne and Jamie and go someplace and celebrate.
Sure, only I can't go along.
I gotta go to a meeting of the Custodian Benevolent Society.
Well, can't you skip it for now?
It don't look good if the treasurer don't show up.
And besides, you got no idea how catty those janitors can be. Huh-huh!
Oh, I must say this is really delightful.
Let's drink to Danny's new job, shall we?
This time next year, president of the company.
Oh, this time next year, president and owner of the company.
Oh, but, of course, forgive me, Danny.
President and owner.
Okay, now that I'm all set.
Still some unfinished business before the house.
Namely, i. e., Jamie.
Move that we table the problem of Jamie at least until after dinner.
Well, I must say, that at this moment, you don't look very much like a problem.
I must say, at this moment,
I don't feel very much like a problem.
There's one thing that will make me forget Jamie's future and that's spaghetti.
Speaking of spaghetti, what's with the waiter?
We're in no hurry. Let's live dangerously.
Go on, Anne. Sing some more, please.
- No, I can't.
- Why?
Because some idiot said she had a cold voice, that's why.
Whatever that means.
Well, it was no idiot. It was the director of the Brooklyn Music Forum.
You're not gonna take one man's opinion, are you?
You know better.
You've gotta keep trying.
Well, I'm tired of trying.
To get ahead in music, you have to know someone and someone important.
You can't just walk in and sing.
Why not? If you're good.
If you know you're good.
Lately I'm beginning to think they may be right...
...that there is something missing in my singing.
- Well, I think your voice is beautiful.
- Oh, but you haven't really heard it.
- I've heard enough to know it's beautiful.
- You can't know from what you've heard.
Well, go on. Sing something else.
Yeah, go ahead. I dare you, Annie.
Well, I never let anyone dare me.
And don't you call me Annie.
Okay.
I double dare you, Annie.
Now, look, Danny Miller, I...
Don Giovanni.
- Go ahead. I'm listening.
- So am I.
- But that's a duet.
- Well?
You don't expect me to sing a duet by myself, do you?
- Is that the only thing that's stopping you?
- Yes.
- Well?
- Well?
Ahem. Well.
Well, well, Jamie.
Hello, Nick.
What are you doing here alone?
Boy, this is my chance.
I got questions to ask you about Mr. Chips.
Hey, where's Danny?
Where's the Brooklyn thrush?
- He's taking Anne home.
- Ahh!
L 'amour toujours, I'amour.
Oh, yes. L 'amour toujours, I'amour.
You're quoting me.
Maybe there's a streak of royalty in my blood, huh?
Say, that's a very fine chateau.
You know we...
You know...
You know we gotta start rounding up a doll for you.
A doll?
A chick or as they was known in my youth, a sweet patootie.
Nick, there are so many new things to get used to in Brooklyn...
...I think it's a little soon for a sweet patootie.
The only way to see a town is with a girl hanging on your arm.
Jamie, maybe Danny would let you borrow Anne for sightseeing purposes.
She likes him quite a lot, doesn't she?
And he's crazy about her.
Quite.
Nick, you were asking me about Mr. Chips...
Jamie, if we could only find you a girl like Anne.
Look, Nick, why don't you try this on?
It's never suited me.
Do you think this type lid would do something for my personality?
I think your personality would do something for the, uh, lid.
Lend it a little dash, shall we say?
Ahh.
We was made for each other.
It becomes you, Nick. It's yours.
In return, I'm gonna try and find you a girl like Anne.
Think how swell it'd be, walking her home like Danny does...
...sitting on her front stoop, whispering sweet nothings...
...and talking over your plans with her.
If I had a girl like Anne, I think
I'd want to talk about her all the time.
There's so many things I'd wanna know.
When she was a little girl, did she wear pigtails...
...or big bows in her hair?
Did she wear high-button shoes and hate them?
You know, romantic little things like that.
That's what I'd wanna know if I was sitting on the front stoop with a girl like Anne.
Gee, if we could only find a girl for him.
Oh, I know you wanna do a lot for Jamie, but, honestly, Danny...
...I don't see where your getting a girl for him is quite the right way.
After all, a man has to get a girl for himself.
But Jamie's much too shy. He never will.
Oh, I don't know.
He doesn't even talk when he's with strangers.
A girl would never notice him.
Oh, I don't know.
Here I've been sitting here doing nothing but talking about Jamie.
Well, after all it's only natural.
He's your friend and, well,
I don't mind talking about Jamie.
I know, but there was so much
I wanted to say about you and me.
- That's awfully nice, Danny, but I...
- Oh, please, Anne, don't go.
But, Danny, it's late.
There are 25 schoolteachers living here...
...and you don't want them talking about my coming in after midnight?
Oh, of course not.
Good night, Danny, it's been a wonderful evening.
Gee, I guess we're going steady now, huh? Hey?
You got any records for me?
We wanna play them all over again.
You picked out some beauts.
Johnny, your mother called about three times.
- I think you'd better make some tracks.
- I'll go right home, Danny.
Emil, how'd you like those records I got you?
Ma says if I play that once more, she's gonna leave home.
- But she likes it too.
- Hey, Danny?
Wait a minute, kids.
I'll get him to sing it for us.
Say, Danny, will you sing this one for me?
I can't read music, you know?
- Which one?
- This one.
- Come on, all the booths are filled.
- We can't get to hear anything.
That's right.
You might be late for supper, and I'll have every mother in Brooklyn on my neck.
Okay, I'll do it for you. Come on.
I can see a steeple
Surrounded by people
Oh, how real it all starts to seem
Just as the choir is singing
My alarm starts ringing
It's the same old dream
And then my thoughts inspire A scene by the fire
In a cottage close by a stream
I know it all by heart now
We're about to part now
It's the same old dream
If you but knew
How many times I pretend
That I'm with you
I know your heart would unbend
You'd see me through
Until my dream Had a happy ending
And I can picture clearly
The things I love dearly
And in the center
You reign supreme
We kiss and I discover
That I'm the lonesome lover
It's the same old dream
Well?
Didn't like the song, huh?
Well, maybe you didn't like the way I did it.
Suppose you take a crack at it.
Let me see what you can do with it.
I can see a steeple
Surrounded by people
Oh, see how real it starts to seem
Get the choir singing
And then
My clock starts ringing
It's the same old dream
My thoughts inspire
Scenes by the fire
In a cottage close
By a rippling stream
Be rippling
You know it by heart now
We're just about to part now
It's the same old dream
Slightly off the beam
The same old dream
Well, that's swell, for kids your age...
...but when you get to be my age, why, you mellow a little bit.
As a matter of fact, you enjoy doing it this way.
If you but knew
How many times I pretend
That I'm with you
I know your heart would unbend
You'd see me through
Until my dream
Had a happy ending
And I can picture clearly
The things I love dearly
In the center
You reign supreme
We kiss and I discover
I'm a lonesome lover
It's the same old dream
It's the same
Old dream
Does that mean that someone's gonna buy a copy?
Oh, I am.
I am. I am.
Over there.
- Good work.
- Thank you very much.
Oh, excuse me a moment.
- Hi, Jamie
- Hello, Danny.
What do you think happened?
Since I've been here, business has picked up.
It's as it should be.
You're almost finished for the day?
Yeah. Oh, I mean, no, no.
Mr. Dobson wants to talk to me about something very important.
- And I'll probably be stuck here for a while.
- But, Danny, Anne's coming for dinner.
Yes, I know. Would you do me a favor and keep her company until I get home?
- She talks about you constantly anyway...
- What an extraordinary waste of time.
- Run along and I'll see you in a little while.
- Right. Bye.
And if you like it now, Jamie, wait till you get a load of it in the winter.
After a snowstorm, that's when it's beautiful.
The ice on the sidewalk.
And then the thaw.
The sawdust tripping you up.
The muddy slush in the gutters...
...and my three brothers, the street cleaners, shoveling it up...
...and then the snowballs flying around your head.
Them little murderers.
Ah, Brooklyn in the wintertime.
What time of year do you like best, Jamie?
Oh, springtime I think.
Oh, really?
Isn't that funny because I do too.
Really? What an amazing coincidence.
Spring? I got nothing against spring.
I enjoy it.
We got a tree here in Brooklyn.
You should see the dogwood blossoms in England in May.
You should see the dogwood blossoms right here in Prospect Park in May.
- I hope you'll show them to me.
- You ain't eating nothing.
What's the matter?
Did I cook with a heavy hand?
- Oh, no, Nick, it's just that I...
- Then why ain't you eating?
- I don't know.
- I'll tell you what.
Go into the parlor...
...or rather the drawing room...
...and I'll bring you in the coffee.
Right.
You know, it's really been wonderful getting to know you, Anne.
- Why?
- Oh, I don't know. It...
Well, we've hardly talked, really, and all we know about each other...
...is that we both like springtime best.
Well, if we did talk...
...a great deal, I mean, I imagine we'd find we like all the same things.
- So do I.
- Do you really?
Do you really, Anne?
A catastrophe.
This ain't according to the plans.
What to do?
What to do?
Mr. Chips, you never had this problem.
Your kids were smaller than my Danny.
Danny.
I gotta go find Danny.
- What's the matter, Nick?
- I ran out of sugar.
It's funny, Danny said you were too shy to talk to girls.
Oh, not since I've been over here, not since I met you.
Jamie, if you liked someone a great deal...
...you wouldn't be afraid to tell her so, would you?
Oh, no. No.
I think if I liked someone a great deal,
I'd want to talk about it all the time.
I'd want to tell her how...
How things I had taken for granted seem wonderful...
...and how everything seemed to mean more.
Music and words and even people's faces.
Oh, how different everything is when you like someone a great deal.
- Anne?
- Yes, Jamie?
Jamie. Jamie. Everything's so great,
I can't stand it. I can't stand it.
- Hello, Annie. Look.
- Hello.
- Well, what is it?
- It's your song.
- The circles are for our pictures.
- But I never wrote a song.
Of course you did.
You didn't know that you did.
- You thought it was a funeral march.
- Oh, Jamie, that's wonderful.
- You mean this is...?
- Yeah, yeah. This is your song.
I put words to it and I played it for Mr. Dobson, and he loved it.
And he's gonna publish it.
Why, you're a big success, that's all.
Oh, Danny. Jamie, isn't that wonderful?
Look, I hope you're not sore that I put words to it.
I didn't change the melody at all, honest.
It's just the way you wrote it.
- Oh, I'm not, it's just...
- Let me play it for you.
Anne, sing it for him, won't you?
The music is Jamie's and the words are mine...
...and they're for you.
Time after time
I tell myself
That I'm so lucky
To be loving you
So lucky
To be The one you run to see
In the evening
When the day is through
I only know
What I know
The passing years will show
You've kept my love
So young
So new
Time after time
You'll hear me say
That I'm so lucky
To be loving you
Oh, it's beautiful. It's perfectly beautiful.
- It's wonderful, Danny.
- Wonderful?
Why, it's better than that.
It's gonna be published.
Do you realize how tough it is today to have a song published?
It's yours too, we're partners.
Shellgrove and Miller.
Why, we might even worry
Rodgers and Hammerstein a little bit.
I hope you've got more funeral marches because Mr. Dobson wants to see us.
We're gonna get a quick start on your career:
I can't, Danny.
I'm going back to England.
Why, you don't know what you're saying.
You can't leave now.
We're just getting started.
Don't you think I ought to get started in my own country?
I think that...
Look, we'll talk about this some more.
Anne, I...
Oh, please do excuse me, but I have been told that the teacher is here.
Miss Fielding, the teacher.
Why, yes, she is. Won't you come in?
Anne, this lady would like to see you.
This is Miss Fielding.
Oh, please excuse that I, uh...
Uh...
I'm Mrs. Kardos. I'm Leo's mother.
Leo's mother? Well, I'm so happy to meet you, Mrs. Kardos.
Leo's the best pupil I've ever had.
This is Danny Miller and this is Jamie Shellgrove, Mrs. Kardos.
So happy. So happy.
If you'd like to speak alone,
Jamie and I could...
Oh, no, no.
Now that I'm here, I think perhaps it's wrong for me to come.
Of course not.
We're so happy to have you.
Please sit down, Mrs. Kardos.
Miss Fielding,
I want to speak to you about Leo.
You must be very proud of Leo,
Mrs. Kardos.
He has such great talent.
What will he do with this talent?
And if he does nothing, this talent will ruin his life.
Anne, I don't understand.
Well, Leo can't afford to go on with his music...
...after he leaves high school.
And there's only one scholarship that would do him any good...
...and he's too young to apply for it.
Oh, but that's frightful.
All day, he's so gay and cheerful.
"Mama," he tells me, "don't worry,
I want to work in the store with you.
And at night, I will study by myself.
It will be fun. "
Fun that at night in his bed he cries.
That he cannot sleep, he cannot eat.
He's a little boy, my Leo, but in his eyes, already he's old.
Oh, Mrs. Kardos, I should've done more.
I should've tried much harder.
I was so disappointed in my own music that I...
Oh, I should've tried harder.
No, no, do not feel bad. Please don't.
If Leo were an ordinary boy,
I could give him what he needs.
But to those with talent, one owes more and this I cannot give.
Who is to care that a little boy becomes artist or no? Who?
Who is to care?
You see, to be poor and have a son like Leo...
...this is to be ashamed always.
Leo is someone for everyone to be proud of, not just his mother but everyone.
You're right, he does need more than ordinary boys...
...and everyone should see he gets it.
There must be some way to help him,
Mrs. Kardos.
- And we'll find it.
- You bet we will.
We could go to the directors of the Brooklyn Music Forum...
...and explain to them and plead.
- You think? You think?
- We will.
The rule exists and if we break it at this time, we'd be establishing a precedent.
Well, it seems to me the least you could do is listen to Leo play.
My dear Miss Fielding, I don't doubt that the boy's magnificent...
...but there's still no point in my hearing him.
Because of his age, he simply is not eligible for this scholarship.
I'm sorry.
Leo's mother was right. No one cares.
Now, wait a minute.
We said last night that we gotta care, and they will too, once they hear him.
They'll have to hear him.
What he needs is a concert.
- We'll see that he gets it.
- Oh, Danny, that's not so easy.
What is that's any good?
We'd have to have a place to give it in.
The music shop.
I know Mr. Dobson will say yes.
He's wonderful about things like that.
Oh, we'd have to have someone important come to see it.
People whose opinions count, you know, like critics and so forth.
- We'll get them.
- If we could only get that board of trustees.
We will. We three and Nick.
Is there anything we have to do that's more important?
Well, Danny, you know, to draw attention to the concert...
...we'd need a sponsor, someone important.
- Do we know anybody important?
- No.
The people of Brooklyn.
That's who'll give the concert.
Do we know many people?
No, but this is a swell way to meet them.
Here, kids, try these.
I should go to the city hall with Anne, but I can't possibly leave now.
Mr. Dobson isn't here and even Fodderwing's gone.
Jamie, how about you taking charge?
Oh, Danny, I couldn't.
For Leo?
Well, I'll try.
Attaboy.
Hey, kids, my buddy here is gonna take charge for about an hour...
...while I run out somewhere.
Oh, gee.
Oh, he's a wonderful guy.
Give him the breaks.
Jamie, don't worry about anything.
Just play loud.
Anne and I have some business with His Honor.
Well...
...follow me. Ahem.
What are we gonna do now?
Well, what can I do for you, ladies and gentlemen?
Nothing, unless you can play
"Whose Baby Are You?"
"Whose Baby?"
Well, where's the music?
I'll, uh... I'll do the best I can.
Baby, baby
Whose baby are you?
Baby, baby
Whose baby are you?
You told me
That you'd be my love forevermore
So how come you won't let me
Hang around your door
It ain't right, it ain't right
For you to do me like you do
Oh, tell me, baby
Whose baby are you?
You order fancy dishes
Way beyond my means
And while you're caviaring
I'm content with beans
I had to break a poker game
To buy that ring
That mink may not be mink
But it's the closest thing
It ain't right, it ain't right
Spending all my money
For your fancy clothes
I even went in hock
To buy those nylon hose
And after I have bought you
All that finery
You say you look too swell
To be seen with me
It ain't right, it ain't right
For you to do me like you do
Oh, tell me, baby
Whose baby are you?
Thank you so much.
You've been wonderful and I appreciate it.
- Are you sure there isn't anything else?
- No, I think that's all for now.
- Well, we'll be back in time,
Miss Fielding. It's been fun.
- Bye.
- Goodbye.
Finished?
- Well, thank you very much.
- You're welcome.
- Is the piano all right, Jamie?
- Oh, yes, yes.
They're moving the concert piano up onto the platform after dinner.
Ahh.
- Tired?
- Oh, but it's a good tired.
Perhaps you can get a nap before it's time for you to dress.
- I'll take you home.
- In a minute.
All I can think of is Leo and the concert tonight.
Do you know I never thought I'd be able to be near a stage or a platform...
...no matter how small, without thinking of myself?
- About your own career?
- My ex-career.
About your debut, perhaps, as a great singer?
At the Metropolitan.
And what would you sing at your debut at the Metropolitan? Have you decided that?
Oh, well, that's the first thing you do decide.
I'd sing Lakmé.
Sing it, Anne.
All right.
Oh, it was wonderful, Anne, just wonderful.
And you will come to the Kardos concert tonight, won't you, Mr. Roberts?
Yes, that's fine.
You sure you have the address?
Dobson's Music Shop.
Good. I'll see you there.
Goodbye.
And there you are. That's the last one.
Why, Nick, you're a thing of beauty.
Grooming, that's my secret.
Maybe it's artistic to go to Leo's concert like that, but is it polite?
How's anyone gonna notice that with my new tie on?
Yuk-yuk-yuk-yuk-yuk-yuk.
We've got a little time yet.
Gotta wait for Jamie anyway.
I sure hope he got Anne to go home and rest. She must be worn out.
Danny, tell me something.
You ain't seen Annie lately, have you?
I had lunch with her and Jamie today.
No, I mean, you ain't seen her alone like... Like on a date.
Oh.
No, I guess I haven't.
I haven't had much time...
...with the concert and all the other things I've had to do.
Don't it seem to you that if you were in love...
...that you'd sort of make the time?
What are you driving at, Nick?
What's bothering you?
You know Anne's my girl.
Are you sure, Danny?
Maybe it's because she was the first girl you ran into...
...and I sort of helped make it easy.
What I mean is, are you really crazy about her?
Well, of course I'm crazy about her.
Why?
Why?
Why is anyone in love with anyone?
There's lots of reasons like, for example, you like her eyes or something.
Of course I like her eyes.
They're beautiful.
What color are they?
Brown, dark brown.
Lot of people got dark-brown eyes.
But what's different about Annie's?
There doesn't have to be anything different about Anne's eyes, Nick.
They're beautiful, they're dark and I like them.
How tall is she compared to you?
Uh...
About, um...
What color nail polish does she use?
What kind of perfume?
I don't know.
Do you notice things like that about people?
No. I ain't never been in love.
I thought that when you was, you saw little things that no one else does.
Gee, I don't know.
Oh, Jamie.
- Sorry I'm late. I had to take Anne home.
Jamie, we're having a little argument.
- What color are Annie's eyes?
- Dark brown.
But in the light, they've got little golden flecks.
How tall is she compared to you?
When she's wearing high heels, she comes to here and low heels, to here.
Uh, what color nail polish does she use?
None.
Her hands are just like a little girl's.
And that perfume she uses, that's like a little girl's too...
...so clean and soapy.
But you know the cutest thing about her?
You can always tell when she's going to smile.
Just a second before, she wrinkles up her nose. Always.
Well, I think I better get dressed.
Thanks, Nick.
Come on, Danny.
Well, you're not even dressed yet.
We've gotta fetch Anne. We'll be late.
Jamie, you run along and pick Anne up and I'll see you over at the music shop.
Right.
I never saw anybody care as much about anything...
...as Danny does about this concert.
He's really a wonderful guy.
Guy? How American you're getting.
Yes, you... You've said a mouthful.
- Jamie, let's sit down a minute.
- Right.
Is something wrong?
Something seems to be wrong.
Jamie, maybe you'll think
I'm a little brazen but...
Well, you know I'm in love with you, don't you?
Don't say it, Anne.
Yes, I am. I'm going to say it.
How long must I go on pretending...
...that I don't know that you're in love with me too?
You are, aren't you, Jamie?
Well, when are you going to say something?
He's my best friend, Anne, I...
Oh, darling, that's very noble...
...but it's also very stupid and very ungrown-up.
Don't you know that if nothing ever happened between us that...?
Well, if nothing ever happened...
I don't love Danny.
So I wouldn't be any good for him, would I?
Oh, Jamie.
This isn't easy for me.
Why don't you say something?
Better come along.
We'll be late for the concert.
Anne. Anne, you're angry.
I imagine in a little while I'll be furious but right now I'm just humiliated.
Anne.
Jamie, you made it quite clear there's nothing else to say.
Anne, darling, what can I do? L...
Let's not discuss it the rest of the evening.
Let's just think about Leo and the concert.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I represent the Brooklyn Music Forum...
...which every five years offers a scholarship.
We had thought Leo Kardos was too young to apply for it...
...but tonight, due to the efforts of some Brooklyn citizens...
...we have decided that true musicianship is beyond age limits or rules.
Leo Kardos is hereby awarded a scholarship...
...which will enable him to pursue the study of music for the next five years.
- Good luck, Leo.
- Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Now, what shall I say?
I know what to say.
If I ever get good, it'll be because of you.
I'll work hard and I'll never forget you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Thank you and thank you all and good night.
Good night.
It was very wonderful. Good night.
- Well, sir, I guess we made it.
- I guess we did.
Everything you said about Brooklyn was true, Danny.
I'm really gonna miss it.
- Why, are you going someplace, maybe?
- Yes, back to England in the morning.
What about your career?
I think I'll be able to handle it in England now.
I sort of have that Brooklyn approach.
- Well, that's swell. What about Annie?
- Danny.
Have you asked whether she'd like to go?
Think she could be ready by tomorrow?
Danny!
You don't mean to tell me you haven't asked her to marry you yet?
- Well, I...
- Besides being ridiculous, it's not polite.
But, Danny, what are you talking about?
Anne's your girl.
- Jamie, she's your girl.
- Anyone can see that.
Will you listen to me for just one minute?
- Be a nice quiet little girl. Now, look here...
- I will not be quiet.
Okay, what have you got to say?
I don't want Jamie through the courtesy of Danny Miller or Nick Lombardi.
In fact, I don't want Jamie.
Anne.
- Oh, I beg your pardon.
- I beg your pardon.
Can you tell me...?
- Jamie.
- Grandfather.
Don't go away. I'll be with you.
- But, Jamie...
Hey, Jamie!
- Danny.
- Hey, Pop.
Say, Nick, Jamie's grandfather.
Take him to Luigi's and get him a beer.
Oh, don't tell me.
Don't tell me I'm at last facing the Dukesdom of Dunstable.
Why, you must be Mr. Lombardi.
How do you do?
How'd you...? How did you know?
Jamie wrote me all about you.
Mr. Lombardi, can you tell me what's going on here? I mean...
Hello, Grandfather.
- Dad, this is Miss Fielding,Jamie's girl.
- How do you do?
Everything I said would happen to Jamie has happened.
- Show Grandpop how different you are, son.
- Different?
- Go on.
- Well, um...
- See what I mean?
- He certainly has changed.
Thank you, Danny.
Oh, Danny.
Uh, you know something?
I've never had so much trouble getting rid of a girl in my whole life.
- Oh, Danny, we owe you so much.
- Not me.
It was that nurse in England. Remember?
If it hadn't been for her,
I would never have talked to you.
Nurse? What nurse?
You didn't tell me about no nurse.
Well, she was an Army nurse, Nick.
And she was from Brooklyn.
She wouldn't believe I was from Brooklyn till she saw me making friends.
I don't know nobody who has more friends than you.
- Yeah, I guess she'd believe me now.
- Plump little thing, wasn't she?
Oh, no, she was the kind of girl you'd think is little and plump...
...but she had a terrific figure.
And she stood about so high.
And she was a blond, Nick, she had blue eyes.
You know, most blue eyes are round.
But hers kind of slanted a little bit on the ends, and her hands...
Why, Nick, did you hear what I said?
Did you hear me? About her I noticed.
That's the one. That's the one, I tell you.
- I gotta find her.
- How?
Well, if she's a Brooklyn nurse she's gotta be in Brooklyn.
- But maybe she ain't here.
- She's gotta be here.
And believe me, I'll find her.
I'll bet you the Brooklyn Bridge I find her.
Sure you will, Danny.

I just come from- from Budapest with my nieces.
And-This is Jenny, and this is Rosie.
I- I look- look my- look for my old friend, Mr. Tsimmis.
Is- Is he here? No?
I'm new here.
Waiter!
This man is looking for somebody by the name of Crimmis.
No. No, Crimmis-Tsimmis, with the "Zis."
Tsimmis, the theater booking agent?
[Chuckles] There is just one Tsimmis in the world.
Tsimmis! There's somebody here to see you!
Oh!
[Chuckles]
Ignatz, my old friend.
[Speaking Foreign Language]
Oh! [Chuckling]
Since eight long years,
I don't see you.
That's right.
And since eight long years, you owe me a thousand hellers... from that last game of clobyosh we played in Budapest.
Here in America, that's, uh, $11.
N-Not for the children.
[Exclaims]
We will play now.
Maybe I win it back.
[Latsie]
Come.
Latsie, take that off.

I am glad we didn't play dominoes.
Nothing you should play, you understand?
[Shouting]
[Laughing]
Mr. Tsimmis was just asking about you.
- Same old trouble, Uncle?
- There is no trouble.
Only I have $42 in I.O.U.'s, all from your uncle, and I don't get paid.
Look, eight dollars he loses to me in Zimmerman's back room.
Back room? It wasn't in the back room.
It was in the center of the restaurant.
All right, all right.
Six dollars from Lichau's out by the kitchen.
Kitchen? I never played cards in the kitchen.
That-That was in the back room.
Yes, yes, yes.
Here, $22 when we played in my office.
- In- In your office?
- Yes, in my office.
- All right, all right.
- Not a cent do I get. What is this?
Uncle, aren't you ashamed?
After you promised me.
I give you my word.
Never again I will touch a card.
So help me.
Look, Mr. Ignatz, you'll never get your money as long as we work here.
So if you find us a real job, why, we could pay you a little every week for Uncle's losses.
- Wouldn't we, Rosie?
- Of course. You could take it out of our salary.
- Would you go out of town?
- Oh, we'd go anywhere.
All right, girls, uh, here's a date I promised
Miller's Midgets, but I give it to you.
But this is the last time we play clobyosh, you understand?
- Oh, it's a deal. Where do we go?
- Elmira.
Elmira?
Is it on the map?
You got to catch the 7:30 from Hoboken in the morning.
We're on it. Come on, Jenny. We just have time to rent costumes before they close.
- Coming, Uncle?
- Li-Little later, darling. Little later.
- Uncle, so help you?
- [Laughing]
Sweetheart.
So help me.
[Laughs]
So help me.
[Hums]
Will you have the cards again in your face?
Later. But first, we will play one more game.
[Whistle Blowing]
Tickets.
Tickets, please.
Tickets.
Half fare.
- How old are you?
- I'm 10, and my sister's 11.
Uh, we always travel half fare.
- [Punches Tickets]
- Hmm.
Tickets, please.
[Sighs]
See, I told you we could get by with it.
- That's $3.00 saved.
- [Train Whistle Blowing]
- Oh, uh, just a minute.
- I beg your pardon?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to-
That's all right, little girl.
No charge for looking.
Uh, are you an actor?
Well, the jury's still out, but, uh, I think so.
Well, what do you do?
I just finished two weeks at the New York Victoria.
Hammerstein's Victoria?
There's only one.
Well, then-Then you must be a headliner.
Mm, yes, when I'm not starring in musical comedy.
Oh.
Uh, you must know everybody in New York.
Everyone from Lillian Russell to Georgie Cohan.
We don't know a soul.
We sing and dance. And when we grow up, we'd just love to be on the stage... if we could meet the right people.
[Chuckles]
All little girls want to go on the stage.
Oh. I- I wonder, please, could you introduce us to Mr. Hammerstein?
Oscar? When you're in New York, look me up.
He has dinner every week with me at the Friars Club.
The Friars Club?
Oh, how wonderful.
- You're very kind, Mr. - Mr. -
- Fox. Harry Fox.
Well, uh, wouldn't you like to turn your chair around, Mr. Fox?
We'll all be more comfortable.
[Giggles]
- [Giggles]
- I suppose so.
How far are you going,
Mr. Fox?
- Elmira.
- Elmira?
You're playing there after Broadway?
Oh. I always like to break in my new material out of town.
Uh, where are
you two kids going?
- Oh, we're going to Elmira too.
- To visit some relatives.
Well, then you can catch my act while you're there.
I should say we will.
- Mr. Fox?
- Oh, thanks.

Have you met Elmer?

- Stop shouting! There's a rehearsal on!
- [Man] Shut up!
- That wasn't him. That was me!
- What's eatin' you anyway?
- I'm Harry Fox.
What's the idea of billing an unknown sister act over me? And a trained seal!
- Now-
- Who are the Dolly Sisters anyway? I never heard of them!
What's the difference?
Nobody ever heard of you either!
Besides, there's two of them, and there's only one seal. And there's only one of you!
Now you listen-

- Hello.
- [Chuckles] Surprise.
- You, uh, might have told a fella.
Mr. Fox objects to his billing here.
What's wrong with the billing?
- I dressed with a trained seal once. We didn't get along.
- Oh, is that so?
Have you got a college degree?
A. B? B. A? Ph. D?
- What's your alphabet?
- Well, I was lucky to get through high school.
Well, then, don't look down on an educated seal.
- Let me tell you some-
- Well, he can't help it.
You see, Mr. Fox is a Broadway headliner.
- Direct from two weeks at Hammerstein's Victoria.
- Rosie, please.
Well, is there any law against a fella giving himself a little buildup?
- Never heard of one.
- [Man] Come on! Who's next?
We haven't got all day! We got an Elks dance and a wedding to play! Let's go!
Hi, fellas. Look, bring me on with a fast eight bars of "I Love the Lady."
And there's a new tune there I wrote myself called "I Can't Begin To Tell You."
- It's a ballad, but I want it played lively, see?
- Everybody does.

Thanks, boys.
I'll see you tonight.
[Orchestra]
They went that way.
Hey, they're not bad little babes.
- How about you and me datin' them up tonight?

Oh, thanks very much.
Oh, yeah?

I'd make a fur coat out of him.

Well?

Oh, for us?
- You're the Dolly Sisters, ain't ya?
- Well, yes, but-
- That's what it says here.
- Thank you very much.
I knew it. That nice-looking gentleman with the bald head in the third row. Remember him?
How could I forget?
He's been in that same seat for five shows.
Oh. Him.
"My mistake. You two girls can be billed over me anytime.
How about a cup of coffee?
Harry Fox."
Oh, how sweet.
Let's go have a bite to eat with him.
There you go again,
Josephine.
- Well, we've got to eat anyway.
And stop calling me Josephine.
- [Both Laughing]
-[Orchestra]
- This is our introduction.
We're in the wings.
This is the proscenium arch.
And do just like I told you.
Don't get nervous, honey.
Well, shouldn't we be singing as we come on?
Everybody else does that, so we'll be different. We'll sing later.
It's a funny feeling working with a man.

Darling, we're sensational. We're killing 'em.
Let's take another bow.
Okay.
- [Both Laughing]
- [Record Skipping]
- You picked that up in a hurry.
- Rosie will get it in a minute. She's awfully quick.
But, Jenny, I-Well, I've been looking for a girl in my act, and I thought-
Oh. You mean just you and me?
Oh, Rosie and I could never separate.
Why-Why we've been an act ever since we were kids.
But I mean, a really classy act.
Evening clothes,
Fifth Avenue dresses.
Why, pretty soon, we'd really be on the bill at Hammerstein's.
Oh, I'm sorry, Harry.
And I'm flattered that you want me... but, well, you ought to know what a sister act means.
W-We're tied together somehow, and nothing else counts.
No matter how attractive it seems.
- Well, anyway, thanks for the attractive.
- [Man] Quiet!
Elmer wants to sleep.
[Barks]
[Barks]
[Whistle Blowing In Distance]
Whew! All that rush for nothing.
You might have at least waited long enough to say good-bye.
- Just common courtesy.
- Oh, he's common enough as it is.
Here, you watch the bags while I go get the tickets.
- [Train Whistle Blowing]
- Psst! Hey, Jenny.
Jenny. Psst.
Hey, come here.
Oh, Harry.
I didn't mean to rush off without saying good-bye.
Yeah, sure. Say, Jenny, there's something I got to tell you.
I'm gonna miss you.
Oh. Why, you hardly know me though.
Yeah, sure, I know, but I know how I feel.
I'm gonna miss you too,
I guess.
Don't you know?
- [Train Approaching]
- [Whistle Blowing]
Gee, I never thought falling in love would be like this.
It's so- so sudden and- and all mixed up with trains and things.
So, Jenny, look, if I don't get to New York right away...
- give me a break and wait for me, will ya?
- Oh, of course I will, Harry.
That's all I wanted to know.
[Rosie]
Jenny?
- Good-bye.
- [Rosie]Jenny!
Somebody could have stolen our bags.
Now what have you been up to?
Oh. Oh, uh, my handkerchief blew away.
There isn't a breeze.
For a lost handkerchief, you certainly have a peculiar gleam in your eye.
Stanton, Alford, Dover and Hoboken. All aboard!
[Whistling]
Oscar Hammerstein's office.
No, Mr. Caruso, he's not in.
That could never happen to me in Saint Petersburg. I'll never wait.
I'm so sorry.
And whether you're playing or not,
keep working.
Practice your singing every minute and practice your dancing.
Well, uh, aren't you Flo Daly?
- Gee! I read where Ziegfeld's gonna star you.
- Oh.
We really appreciate every bit of advice you've given us, Miss Daly.
Well, don't appreciate it. Use it.
Live with and for your work.
That's the only way you'll get ahead.
That's what I do every minute I'm awake.
Miss Daly! The bookie says
the horses are at the post.
Oh, tell him hold on.
I'll be there in a minute.
And remember, girls, concentrate on your work.
Nothing else matters.
Oh.
- Mademoiselle Polaire.
- Oh, he's expecting you. Will you come in, please?
Oh!
- The famous Polaire.
- Yeah.
Oh, excuse-
Jenny!
Hello, Harry.
Oh, gee, I'm glad to see you.
- Hello, Rosie. How are you?
- I was fine.
Say, I- I wrote you, but you must have moved,
'cause all the letters came back.
Oh, that's a shame.
I'm so sorry.
- Well, this is great luck.
Could I buy you a cup of coffee?
- Uh-huh.
To think, the best offer I've had all day has to come from you.
Why, you girls have got twice as much talent-
10 times as this Polaire... and you're a hundred times better looking.
You just haven't made people recognize it.
What you need is style, importance.
- [Snap Fingers]
- Glamour.
Well, um, how do we get this glamour... out of a hat like a magician with a rabbit?
In a way. But if you girls do as I say... you'll have Hammerstein on his hands and knees begging for you.
- I can hardly wait.
- Rosie.
It'll take nerve- plenty of it- and a heart full of courage.
But if you follow my advice, you'll never have to play the small-time again.
[Clock Chiming]
[Chiming Stops]
- What time is it, Uncle?
He said they would be here at 2:30.
Well, Mr. Hammerstein's always a little late.
Oh, he's two days late this time, and on our money. Borrowed money.
They'll be here.
Harry said so.
Oh, of all the idiotic things
I ever let you talk me into.
And-And the wardrobe you've charged.
Such fine references
I gave for you.
- What references?
- What references? The Hungarian ambassador.
- [Rings]
- Oh. [Gasps]
Give it to me.
Give it to me. Hello?
Hello? Hello?
The suite of the Dolly Sisters.
What? Yes.
Yes, send them right up.
Quick! Quick!
They're coming! They're coming!
- Now, Miss Smarty, who's an idiot?
- I don't believe it.
Girls, don't forget the Hungarian accents you were born with.
- I wish I could show you what I mean.
- [Doorbell Buzzes]
[Buzzing]
I'm sorry we're late, ladies, but Mr. Hammerstein was detained at his banker's.
Mr. Hammerstein,
I want you to meet Miss Jansci Dolly.
[Hungarian Accent]
How do you do?
- [Harry] And, uh, this is Miss Rozsicka Dolly.
- What is his name, please?
Hammerstein.
Oscar Hammerstein.
I do not hear of him before.
Is he important manager?
Well, he's only the biggest and most important manager in America.
- [Together] Oh.
- Then we will consider him.
- No, Rozsicka?
- Mm. Yes, Jansci.
Won't you come in, please?
[Together]
Play, please.
[Piano: Up-tempo]
We have been to gay Paris
Très joli
Gay Paris
Where your heart, she dances like the bubbles in the wine
Where life is so divine
Where love she's yours and mine
Mais oui, toujours
Vive la France
Ah, vive l'amour
When we was in Vienna
Vienna
Was so wonderful
We drink, we waltz we eat, we waltz, we drink
We waltz again
What else can you do
In Vienna
To Budapest we make a trip
To dance to gyp... sy music
But when you do the czardas
Just be careful what you're saying
A lady can't be too discreet
When violins
Is "playingk"
Yes, we have been around
We've lived
und we have learned
And we'd like to make it clear
That as far as we're
Concerned

Mr. Hammerstein, you dare to shake your head at the Dolly Sisters?
From Budapest?
Never.
Never before have I seen two such lovely girls.
- You mean you like us?
- You'll take us?
My dears, I don't care where you come from- Budapest or Brooklyn.
You open at the Victoria in two weeks.
- Oh, Jenny!
- Oh, Rosie!
[Together]
Harry!
If you're a lonely little lady
And life hasn't been so nice to you
Listen, lonely little lady
This is our advice
To you
Don't be too old-fashioned
Old-fashioned girl
Give yourself that 1915 flair
When you're walking up
Fifth Avenue
And wintery winds are blowing
Don't get too upset
If your petticoat is showing
Be like Irene Castle
And bob your hair
Throw away your flannel underwear
Light a cigarette
Be a suffragette
Be part of the merry world
And order an old-fashioned
Old-fashioned girl
And if you're not as pretty
As the dollies in the Follies
Don't let it worry you a bit
You won't be too old-fashioned
If you wake up
To the magic of a makeup kit
I'm Lady Lipstick
I do well by mademoiselle
But bear this thought in mind
A kiss isn't tellable
If you use the indelible kind
I'm Patricia Powder
I dispose of the shine on your nose
Who would try to deny my repute
I'm adored by belles
But not by their beaus
'Cause, ooh, what I do
To a blue serge suit
Patricia, you're a wonder and you know your stuff
But I'm the one that's pushed around and treated rough
I hate to cause dissension but why don't you ever mention
Your little poor relation
Patsy Powder Puff
[Choir]
I am Rosie Rouge
You won't be called a hussy
Just because you're properly painted
And remember a girl that's quaint
Never gets acquainted
Mascara
I'm Mascara
I can do for you
What I did for Theda Bara
For in my subtle way I emphasize
That gleamy, dreamy
"come and see me" mischief
In your eyes
You must agree that we've proven conclusively
That powder and lipstick and rouge
Improvises youth
And disguises truth
Powder and lipstick and rouge
Radiates the cold
Rejuvenates the old
What if some freckles may vex you
Just spend some shekels and freckles will
Never perplex you
Beautiful faces come out of vanity cases
With powder and lipstick and rouge
What if some freckles may vex you
Just spend some shekels
And freckles will never perplex you
Beautiful faces come out of vanity cases
[Choir]
So don't be too old-fashioned
Join the merry world
Old-fashioned
Girl
Mademoiselle, permit me to tell you... how much I am enchanted that you're coming to Paris under my management.
- Thank you.
- Here are the contracts and the tickets.
You have the best suite on the Mauretania.
Oh, thank you, Monsieur Philippe.
We're almost all packed.
Good night, Monsieur Philippe, and thank you for liking us so much.
Mademoiselle.
- Au revoir. [Speaking French]
- Thank you.
And now, monsieur, how would you like a little snack with me?
- What?
- A little snack.
Snack? I- I don't know, but if you show me just once, I can play it.
- I mean something to eat.
- To eat? I am not a bit hungry.
But maybe a little steak with some potatoes and- and a bite of pudding, please.
A suite on the Mauretania.
That isn't the way we came over.
I'll say it isn't.
Is Harry still on the road?
I don't know.
I just can't understand him.
He used to write me every day no matter where he was playing.
I guess he's met someone else and hasn't the nerve to tell me.
Could be. Well, I'm gonna go tell Flo about Paris.
Oh, don't forget we have a date with her tonight at Ronnie Warburton's.
- Jenny.
- Harry!
Oh!
- It's really you.
- Uh-huh.
- Oh!
- Darling, darling.
Here, let me look at you.
Yep. You're exactly like
I dream about you.
- Do you know you always smile with your eyes first?
- Do I?
- Yes.
- Oh, darling.
Oh.
Oh, Harry, why didn't you let me know you were coming?
Well, I couldn't.
I just happened to be in town, and I got a sudden impulse to drop by and say hello.
You know me-
Always obey that impulse.
Oh.
Well, Rosie and I have obeyed one too.
We're sailing day after tomorrow.
We've signed with Philippe for a show in Paris.
Paris? Well, gee, that-that's great.
You're really glad.
Well-Well, of course.
It's- It's what you want, isn't it?
Of course.
That's what you want too, isn't it?
Or maybe Paris isn't far enough.
Maybe you'd like it if I went to China.
- Oh, Harry, be honest with me.
What's happened to us?
- Nothing.
- Is- Is there someone else?
- You know it isn't that.
Well, then it must be something.
It- It can't just be the separation.
Then what?
Oh, Harry, it isn't because
I landed on top first, is it?
Oh, you fool.
You darling fool.
How can that make any difference?
But it does, Jenny.
And it's not just a matter of pride.
But you love me, don't you?
And I love you.
That's all that counts.
Everything else is nonsense.
No, it isn't nonsense,
Jenny.
I've seen other people try it, dozens of them.
Oh, it's not just the money or the fame.
It's a lot of other little things all added up. It just won't work.
Oh, it's all right as long as the stardust is still there... but then the stardust blows away and a kind of poison sets in.
In- In other words, you- you don't want to marry me.
- More than anything else in the world.
- Oh.
But I can't.
Not till I get someplace.
Not even if I ditch the Paris engagement?
I can't let you do that, Jenny.
Oh, I see.
Well, there's no use dragging things out, is there?
I mean, we-we might as well make a clean break and say good-bye.
Yeah, I guess so.
- Good-bye then.
- Good-bye, Jenny.
Uh, no more letters.
Not that you've been writing much lately.
No. No more letters.
But- But we'll always be friends?
Sure, sure.
Good-bye, Jenny.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Buy you a cup of coffee?
It's no use, Harry.
Just go, will you?
That Daly woman. She had to dope out tomorrow's horses at New Orleans.
- Come on. We're late.
- All right.
- I can't. I'm going home.
- But you promised.
That's what I said.
Taxi!
Taxi!
Taxi!
Oh, thank you. Oh!
- Oh, I was looking for a taxi.
- So I see.
I'll get you one, but it'll take time.
You better take me up on that coffee first.
- No, thanks very much, but I-
- Now see here. You're drenched.
Do you want to get to Paris with pneumonia?
- Well, I guess not.
- All right, then. Come on.
Here you are, Miss Dolly.
That will warm you up.
- Thank you, Mr. Dowling.
-[Ends]
Never forget the first time
I saw those knees.
On the way to Elmira, remember?
Sure.
- You and your half fare.
- [Chuckles]
- There.
- Thank you.
I think the patient has an even chance to recover.
Oh, thank you, Doctor.
You have a lovely manner.
Thank you.
- How about a bite to eat?
- No, thank you. I don't care for anything.
Uh, what are you doing about your songs?
Oh, nothing much.
Except "Rainbows." Remember it?
Oh, yes. I liked it.
Well, it goes like this now.
[Humming]
Well, I knew I was coming to a party, so I brought my music along.
- Here you are, Mr. Harris.
Help yourself, Mr. Tannen.

- Hello.
- Why don't you stop at my office sometime?
- I'd like to talk business to you.
- I'd be glad to.
- When could you come?
- How about right now?
- No. Tomorrow will do. Good night, Jenny.
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, young fella.
- Good night.
- Good night, Dowling. Good night, Jules.
- Good night, Sam.
- If he puts it in a show, it means half a million copies.
- Yeah.
You see, a twist of the wrist and you're a hit too.
Oh, Harry, do I have to go to Paris?
I don't want to.
But, Jenny, the Folies Bergère, think of the chance.
I still don't want to.
Darling, nobody can turn down an offer like that.
Nobody, darling?
[Doorbell Rings]
Excuse me, Mrs. Fox, for buttin' in like this.
I'm Morrie Keno- Keno and Kraus.
- Hello.
- We played on the bill with you and Rosie in Atlanta once.
You wouldn't remember our act.
[Chuckling] We were on too early.
Anyway, when war was declared, my partner enlisted right away. Me, I couldn't make it myself.
I'm putting on shows here to sell Liberty bonds.
There's one tonight at the hotel.
I'd like to have you and your sister go on for us.
People love you, and you'll sell bonds like wildfire.
Try and bring Mr. Fox along, but I know he's singin' at recruiting rallies all the time.
Sure made a big hit at the Palace.
Had it comin' to him. Swell fella.
Thanks for comin' tonight.
I'll announce you myself.
- That's about all I can do to help.
- Why-
My partner enlisted right away.
I couldn't make it.
Nice hearing your voice again,
Mrs. Fox. See ya tonight. Ahem.
- Thanks a million.
- We'll be there, and thanks,
Mr. Keno, for dropping in.
It's all right.
Whew!
- Kathi, do you think it's ready yet?
- Just about.
Oh! Here, let me take it out myself.
- Ooh!
- Better you should use these, Miss Jenny.
- Ah.
- Jenny, don't tell me you did that all by yourself?
Mm-hmm. Well, Kathi helped me a little bit.
[Latsie]
Jenny, we have news for you.
Where's Harry? I thought you were picking him up at the Friars.

# Came the wail #

# As part ofthe blues #
# From a whippoorwill out on a hill #

A good musician like I am, like my fatherwas and his father.
That's just it, Dad. You all played exactly alike.
You played the notes somebody else put down.
Oh, so the notes Paderewski put down are not good enough foryou?
It's not that exactly, Dad, but this other music makes you feel like the circus is comin' to town.
Kinda turns you loose inside. You can stretch out and playwhatyou feel.
Well, I'll giveya somethin' to feel.
See ifyou can play this too.
What's this gonna be, Dad, another spankin'? Come here.

What happened here?
What's goin' on?
Did you see that?
- Hold this a minute.
- See whatya done?
You low white trash!
You've wrecked my rig!
You'll pay for this! I'll have the law on ya! Will you get me out ofhere?
Yes, ma'am. Theywere makin' so much fuss, and the horse got so excited...
Well, I forgot all aboutya.
It ain't my fault, lady.
Of course it isn't, you poor man.
You're entitled toyour fare.
The horse is injured too. He used to be a racehorse. [Whinnying]
[Woman ]
Racehorse?
Well, will it cost much to mend that wheel?
Cost about five dollars. I ain't got the money and no way of makin' it now.
How am I gonna feed mywife and kiddies?
Kiddies?
Yes.
Howam I gonna feed 'em?
Poor dear. My little baby crying for milk.
Well, how much did you say it would cost?
Ten dollars.
As much as that? Give him that!
Here. Wait a minute.
You're the onewho ought to payforthis.
I will.
Thatwheel oughta cost six bits.
Here's a buck. Beat it.
She give me that money!
Get outta here.
Don'tyou take it! I'm tryin' to saveyou from gettin' robbed.
That stuff about his wife and kiddies... He hasn't got any.
Beat it or I'll call the cops.
I'll getyour grips out forya, lady.
I don't know why the police don't watch these fellas.
Taking money from women. I never saw anything like it. Listen here!
Speaking of a man who really has a wife and kiddies, there's a fella in jail you can feel sorry for.
Give me my money back. I'll feel sorry some other time.
Just for stealin' a loaf ofbread to feed those hungry little mouths, there he is disintegratin' in a dungeon.
Sorry, but he'll have to go on disintegrating. Hey, sunshine, ask her if she's got a sister.
[Laughter]
Isn't that awful? It's beginning to affect his mind.
I don't know how to thankyou.
Ifyou could let us have two dollars more... I couldn't.
What about my ten dollars?
Oh, that ten.
I have to get to a car line. We'll giveyou a lift. Come on. Come ahead.
Here we are. You'll be out in the morning, thanks to this little angel ofmercy.
Ifyou can't get me out, see ifyou can fix it to get her in.
Isn't that awful? He's really mentally upset.
[Inmate ] Toot it to him onyour oldcornet, boy!
[Inmates Shouting]
Let her go, Leo!
[ Yelling,
Shouting Continues ]
You're taking me to a car line, aren't you? Sure. Where ya headed for?
My grandfather's in Chalmette.
Chalmette?
You can't get there on a streetcar.
You'll have to take another hack.
I can't. I haven't any money left, except a little change.
You tossed offyour last few bucks on account of a cock-and-bull story?
A cock-and-bull story? Well, the, uh, hack driver storywas.
Besides, I didn't know it was all the moneyyou had. You know it now.
Ifyou'd have given it to him, you still wouldn't have had it.
Somehow I don't feel as sorry foryou as I did for the hack driver.
We got a bigger hack. Look at the service you're gettin' here.
And for ten bucks too.
And we're gonna payyou back, besides.
No. We're gonna pay her back, aren't we, boys?
Sure.
Oh, yeah.
Well, here we are.
Hey, Leo! You're takin' this young lady out to Chalmette.
What?
In a beerwagon?
It'll cost ya six bucks in an ordinary cab. This wagon accommodates 40 people.
I don't know 40 people.
Well, who does?
Don't forget: Chalmette.
Roll her offthere.
What will my grandfather say when he sees me rolling off a beerwagon?
I know what he's gonna say, but he can't have any.
Would you like to makeyourself more comfortable? No, thankyou.
Good-bye!
Hello, Ruby.
Nice evenin', isn't it?
Oh, Mr.Jeff! Didyou find that horn tooteryet?
He's wonderful. We were gonna start workin' him in tomorrow, soon as we work him out.
What do ya got there?
Oh. From the landlord.
Another dispossess notice?
'Tain't a valentine.
You'd thinkyou'd get weary ofhangin' these things on me, Louey.
I'm onlythejanitor here. This is addressed to Mr. Sweeney, not me.
You're Mr. Sweeney.
What doya mean?
I don't want to botheryou with details, butyou been unpossessed from here as Mr.
Lambert, Olson, Capalini,
McTavish and Epstein.
But we're all set now. The band is shapin' up great. Our ship's comin' in.
Better be a houseboat, soyou can live in it.
One thing, though. I'll need a couple of dollars.
Guess I'll be runnin' along.
Wait! Wait! Wait a minute!
I don'twantyou to lend it to me.
No? What changed you?
- I got a business proposition. - Oh, you make the propositions and I get the business.
Remember that nice watch my father left me when he died? Mm-hmm.
- I'm gonna letyou have that for security. - Well, that's different.
Nice watch, remember? The gold one?
I remember it well.
He used to wear it right across there.
You got the two dollars?
I had it when I come up.
Yeah, here it is.
Yup, there's the two dollars. Fine, and there's the pawn ticket.
[ Grunts ] Well, I won't have to wind this.
I really think this'll have a great chance to go.
Well, I don't know.
Maybeyou're right.
But, you know, this blue music is darkie stuff.
How doya know the white folks are gonna like it? You and me are white folks.
Yeah, sure. Well, we like it, don't we?
Yes, sir.
We sure like it.
Well, here we are.
How'd you get started playin' this kind of music?
I don't know. I was blowin' hot licks on the bottle when I was a baby.
Pepper the trombone player and Deek live over there. You can bunk in here with me.
You don't see whatyou want, just ask for it.
I already see it, and I want it.
- Hello. - Hey, what is this?
What areyou doin' here?
I'm awfully sorry. I had no other place to go.
When I got to my grandfather's,
I found he had died.
- That's too bad.
- Now I have to go back to Alexandria.
- There's no hurry, is there?
- Well, there certainly is.
I can't go without anymoney, can I?
Didn't your grandfather leave ya anything?
Not a thing. He left my Aunt
Phoebe penniless. Aunt Phoebe?
Yes, so I had to bring her back here with me.
You mean your aunt, she's here too?
Mm-hmm. Oh, you'll simply love Aunt Phoebe.
Is that so?
Where's she hidin' at?
She was out in the hall a minute ago.
I'll get 'em outta here.
Aunt Phoebe?
Phoebe?
She was here just a minute ago.
Aunt Phoebe?
Here I come! Wheee!
[ Grunts ]
Hello!
Did I expriseyou?
- This is my Aunt Phoebe.
- How are ya?
I'm fine. How areyou? Well, I'm...
I'm all right, I think.
Would ya like to come in here? I wanna talk toyou. You wait over there in Pepper's room.
Uh...
Over here.
Ifyou get lonesome, just holler for me.
Right in here, huh?
Sit down here andbe a nice, quiet little girl.
You know, Miss, uh...
Don't say it.
Give me the money you talked me out of.
I'll take the next train.
I haven't got it. I had to get my friend out of jail.
He didn't go back to his kiddies?
No, they starved to death.
You'll getyour money, but wait till I get it. Dames.
What's a dame? It's a girl, darling.
Nothin' like a dame for gettin' a guy in trouble, either.
Oh.
Somebody sat on somebody's hat.
It's my lucky hat!
Well, I guess you might as well move in, makeyourselves comfortable.
Thankyou, but I... I'll move across the hall with Pepper.
You can move in with me and let Betty Lou go across the...
Phoebe!
I didn't say anything.
[ Knocking At Door]
Come in.
Hello, Jeff.
I thought that...
Oh, Maizie, I'm busy right now.
But we had a date, didn't we?
I know, but I'm busy. Beat it.
Don't let me keepyou.
Who areyou? What areyou doin' here?
We live here!
You live here?
Oh, I get it!
Why, you dirty, double-crossin' rat, you!
You!
Serves me right for gettin' mixed up with a dame.
You mean three dames.
Don't forget we're doin' this today for free. This is gratis.
We're gonna show our stuff. What about that ten bucks the manager coughed up?
I get that for strugglin' out there with that dreamy song.
I need that ten bucks to get a dame off my hands. It's fair enough.
Todaywe get our big chance.
Certainly.
This afternoon we're gonna make musical history. How doya like that?
He makes ten bucks.
All we make is history.
Hey, Jeff, you're on, boy.
Come on, we're on.
Come on, getyour stuff together, boys.
# # [Stops ]

Oh, that was fine, wasn't it, darling? Yes.
Thankyou very much, ladies and gentlemen.
And now I'd like to present the Basin Street Hot-Shots, brought toyou this afternoon as an added attraction...
No extra cost toyou, but at great expense to the management ofthis theater.
Take her away, Jack!
My lucky hat.
Here we go. Ready, boys?
Emily, they're playing darkie music!
Well, I never!
Closeyour ears, Clarabelle.
Iftheywere my children, I'd take them out ofhere. That's what I'm going to do!
Come here.
Ah-choo!
It's gettin' so a man can't sleep in a movie house anymore.
You aren't supposed to.
Shh! Phoebe!
Keep tootin', boss!
I'm still with ya!
Play the organ!
Play the organ!
Jack!
Take down the curtain!
# # [Stops ]
What happened?
That's all I need. You don't have to hit me with a brickwall.
- Must be a parade outside.
- Ladies and gentlemen, the management is very sorry and is not responsible.
Ifyou'll keepyour seats, we'll have a picture on in just a moment.
Why didn't they like the music? According toJeff, they're old-fashioned.
All right, all ofya, outside!
Give me my ten bucks and get out, or I'll call the cops!
Now, just keep yourwaistcoat on, Wilbur.
Somedayyou're gonna be braggin' about the time we played here.
Don't forget it, either.
That's so's you'll remember.
You give him a free show and he still beefs. Forget it. Forget it.
What doyou say we give up the whole idea?
What kind of chatter is that?
We shouldn't have played there.
We belong in a big café where people stand up and dance and get hot.
Did the fellow who ate the first oyster give up?
At least he was eatin'.
Come down to the poolroom.
I'll pick up a little eatin' money forya.
Will you take these away from me?
[ Chuckling ]
You know, I was right.
What about?
The roses. You two certainly go together.
Oh, Memphis.
[ Chuckling ]
Wish I could fit in the picture.
Say, you know, ifyou could only sing...
Well, I did sing once at a strawberry festival, andeveryone thought it was prettygood.
That gives me an idea.
- How'd you like to sing with the band?
- A girl singing with the band?
Why not? The band certainly needs something, sugar.
Well, how doyou know I'm good enough?
Just lookin' atya is enough.
Let's try something.
Key ofC?
Well, doyou know that new song called "Waiting at the Church"?
Know it? Sugar, I'm the guy she was waitin' for.
[ Clears Throat, Coughs ]
# There was I waiting at the church #
# Waiting at the church #
Hey, that's all right.
# Waiting at the church #
# When I found he'd left me in the lurch #
# Lor', but it did upset me #
Those are good gestures. # All at once he sent around a note #
# Here's the very note #
# This is what he wrote #
# Can't get away to marryyou today #
# Mywife won't let me #
# Can't get away to marryyou today #
# Mywife won't #
# Let me #
[Memphis ] High, low, jack and the game!
You prettynear had a tear in my eye.
Hey, sunshine, I got a great idea.
What do ya think?
New singer for the band. What's wrong with the old singer: me?
She can sing the high notes.
She might be all right, but it's too late now. She's goin' home.
Wait a minute. Here's the money I borrowed from ya.
Cleans us up, doesn't it? Thanks.
Aw, you and your...
Have a chocolate.
Yeah, don't mind ifl do.
Where'd you get these?
Memphis brought these and the flowers too.
He brought Aunt Phoebe the most wonderful doll. Where'd ya get the money?
Aw, what doyou care?
I don't care, as long as you stay out of jail.
Yes. Where did you get the money, Memphis?
- I hocked my horn.
- Oh! You hocked your horn?
Sure. Well, we're out ofbusiness.
Well, why not?
I don't need it anymore.
Of courseyou do. The band can't play withoutyou.
Shucks, I'm not that important.
You are too. Isn't he?
Sure, he is. And he knows it darn well too. I don't get this.
Well, I do. And I know how to fix it too.
A guy labors and slaves to get a band together and... Wait a minute, sunshine.
On the level, doyou really thinkyou can sell this blue music?
Well, certainly, we can.
Why not? [ Chuckles ]
Whynot? Afterthis afternoon? Yeah.
Those kindofplaces are not forus.
Wait till we get in a café.
I'm waitin'. Yeah, without a horn.
What are you gonna do, hum?
Where did you get this?
Same hock shop.
Hey, I don't play with dolls.
You take it back.
Give him that ticket for that cornet.
Wait a minute!
Go on, give it to him.
All right. I don't argue with angry females.
Here. You'll need this for the money he spent.
Ifl take this, you can't go home.
Which is worse, having no band at all or having me stay here for a few days longer?
Hurry up, now, before the shop closes.
You act likeyou wanted to stay here.
You can thank me for that.
I broke the ice.
Too bad you didn't fall through.
[Laughing]
What's so funny?
- You couldn't have done better with a rehearsal. - How doyou mean?
Well, you fell right into that.
I figured out a way to keepyou in town a few days, huh?
[ Chuckling]
Mightysweet.
You know, sugar, here's somethin'
I can't understand.
You take little sunshine offthe hook so nice, and he just walks out without even saying thankyou.
That's a one-track mind forya.
I guess you're right, Memphis.
All that man has on his mind is blue music.
Here. You'rejust tired tonight.
[BettyLouScreams]
That's breakin' the ice, brother.
Say, I like her.
Here's your cornet.
Heh.
Hello, there.
Hello.
What's the matter?
Yeah, what's gotya down?
It's something I found in my bed this morning.
Something you found in your bed?
What was it?
No doll. You mean you lost a doll?
All but the panties.
Better put 'em on beforeyou catch cold.
Come on, sunshine.
Let's get goin'.
See ifyou can cheer her up.
Bye, chicken feed.
Bye.
You kinda got the misery, ain'tya?
Can'tya even smile?
- What about?
- What about?
Well, maybe we can find something.
Ifyou could turn into a beautiful blond doll.
Well... Who, me? Uh-uh!
That ain't practical!
# #[ChamberMusic]
We're the only band in the countrythat plays the Dixieland style.
Why don'tya try us? I could not think ofit.
My clientele, they are too distingue.
Yeah, but they might go for the novelty ofit. No, thankyou.
We are doing well with our chamber music.
Yes, it's quite somber.
No, no. Cham-ber.
Cham-ber.
Oui.
We can understand that.
Yes.
Good afternoon, gentlemen. Yes.
# # [Piano ]
Hiya, sugar. Hello, Memphis.
Did you and Jeffhave any luck?
Plenty. All of it bad. We've been tossed out of pretty near every café in town.
Well, where's Jeff?
He's inside playin' for real dough.
Railroad tickets.
You don't know it, sugar, butyou're practically on the train right now.
Wait a minute, sugar.
I'll walk along with ya.
Don't look soworried, honey.
I'm goin' with ya... on the same train.
You're what? I may be ridin' the rods, but I'll be with ya.
You would too, wouldn'tyou?
[ Chuckles ] Must be love.
Listen, Memphis, I'm not going.
Not for a while, anyway.
What areya gonna do, I hope?
I'm going to get a respectable job and go to work.
That gives me a great idea.
What kind ofan idea?
You and me.
We'd make a great team...
Playin' and singin' together, all dressed up in fancy clothes, all the men lookin' atyou and wishin', all thewomen lookin' at me and... just lookin'.

Why don'tyou shut up?
We got a band.
Yes, sir, but I'd like to make the best impression I can, and this band wouldn't costyou a thing forthe first night.

Yeah! Yeah!
What is this?
What areyou two doing?
Noodlin'.
Noodling? What's that?
- That's takin' a tune and messin' it up.
- How doyou mean?
Well, that's singin' a song the way it ain't been written.
Oh. Well, come here, Louey.
I wanna talk toyou.
Don't scold him, Betty Lou.
I'm not going to scold him. I wanna learn something. Come on, Louey.
Come over here, Louey.
I wanna talk toyou.
Louey, I want to learn to sing like the colored folks.
You've been a colored man for an awfully long time...
- As long as I can remember.
- Oh, of course.
I mean, how can I learn to sing likeyou and Jeff?
Well, I just open my mouth and it comes pourin' out sweet and hot.
I'm going to sing this like the composer has written it, and I wantyou to tell me what's wrong with it.
# Wait till the sun shines, Nellie #
# When the clouds go driftingby #
Yes'm, that's fine.
Very pretty.
But there's a word for it.
I know there is, darling.
It's correct.
That ain't the word.
You and Jeffwouldn't sing it that way.
No, ma'am.
I know the word.
It's corny!
Honey, you run outside and play blindman's buff.
I want to talk to Louey.
Tell me, Louey, what's the trick to it?
Oh, it's very easy.
'Course, it's kinda hard to explain.
Well, for instance, take the bass.
Bass? Yeah. You know, all songs have a bass.
You know, it goes like this.
# Zoom zoom, zoom zoom #
# Zoom zoom, zoom zoom
Zoom zoom #
# Zoom zoom #
See that?
Just keeps on goin'.
'Course, it ain't goin' nowhere, but, well, it ain't got no place to go.
But it just keeps on.
#Zoom zoom, zoom zoom #
Then you take a note.
What note? The one that's starin'atya from behind the bars, the oneyou're gonna sing.
Oh.
But don't sing it.
Then you take another note.
Bring it around from the other way, then ignore it.
Then you take a lot of notes.
Then you surround that old bass.
You're closin' in on him. You're gettin' closer and closer and closer and...
Nothin' happens.
Then you take a note from here, take a note from there, a note from here, a note from the East, a note from the West.
Take a note from the North.
Take a note from the South.
Take a note from the East, a note from the West, a note from the North, a note from the South; all you gotta do is open your mouth.
Ain't nothin' to it. It's just like walkin' down the street.
[ Chuckles ]
Oh, Louey, that's wonderful.
[ Sighs ]
But tell me, Louey, how can I learn to sing likeyou and Jeff?
You can stop now, bass.
See there?
Don't pay no attention.
Just that old zoom, zoom, zoom.
Oh, Betty Lou, lookwhat
Jefffound! My dolly!
Oh, isn't that wonderful, darling?
Ohh.
What's the matter?
Her panties. I'd better put them on.
It's windy out.
[ Chuckling ]
I heard everyword.
Excuse us, please.
Oh, Jeff, you've made hervery happy.
Here's something oughta makeyou pretty happy too.
Well, hereya are.
Thanks.
What's been goin' on?
What haveya been doin'?
I'm afraid I... I've done something pretty awful.
Well, elaborate, Miss Cobb.
Elaborate.
Well, I...
It all happened so fast.
I mean, there I was with a job.
Yeah?
I told that BlackTie man... thatyour band would play the opening night ofhis café for nothing.
Haveyou been overdoing those gingersnaps again?
No, but I'm afraid I've been talking too much.
You know whatyou've done?
You've blundered us into the greatest chance ofa lifetime, a break in a big café!
You aren't angry?
Angry? Here.
Oh. Well,
I'm afraid there's something else.
You wanna kiss me?
No, it's just that... Well... What?
I have to sing with the band.
You're gonna sing with the band?
Yes, and ifl sing old-fashioned and you play hot...
Afraid it'll be a dogfight, huh?
Let the professor worry about that.
Here's what we do.

Hey, Blackie, nobody can dance to that music!

I'm gonna slap a two-bit cover charge on tomorrow, give the place a little class.
How doyou know they'll be here?
You got no contract.
You know better than that.
They'll be here.
Nobodywalks out on Blackie. They'll stay here till I fire them.
Forjust a few lessons, you were terrific.
Thanks. You and Memphis have been wonderful teachers. Memphis?

Ain't that swell?
Hold it, fellas.
Get a load of that guitar.
What do ya mean? Ya can't even hear the guitar! Let me hear this trombone.
Okay, soloists, okay. Why don'tya listen to the band?
Just hope we're good enough to land that Chicago nightclub job.
Oh, boy! Don't countyour chickens before they're hatched.
We only sent the records yesterday.
They'll be the hottest things to hit Chicago since the fire.
Ifthey like 'em, they'll send us a telegram: "Come a-runnin'."
Louey, what's a telegram?
Oh, that's like a letter, only they tap the message out. Like this.
[ Tap Dancing ]
[Jeff]
Period.
- What's it say? - It says, "Come to
Chicago, boys, and spread the gospel."
[ All Laughing ] I got some more good news foryou.
Remember that fella Granet? You mean the chump that preferred the chamber music?
The same. Well, he just offered us 600 bucks a week to quit Blackie and work for him.
[Memphis ] You're gonna take it, aren'tya? Till we hear from Chicago.
They're making too much noise.
- What's the matter, honey? You sleepy?

Well, I had a speech all rehearsed... about music, moonlight and me, but...
What happened to it?
Oh, just gone with the wind, sugar.
No room in my mind for anything butyou.
See, I got a job now and some money.
Gonna get some more.
None ofit's any good withoutyou.
You're beautiful, sugar.
You could marry anybody.
Don't know why you should marry me, but...
Oh, Memphis, you're so sweet. I...
I know.
You don't love me.
Well, I...
Hey, uh...
Is it Jeff?
Don't be ridiculous.
Wait a minute.
You just can't get that guy offyour mind, can ya?
He only thinks of me as part ofthe band.
He's never looked at me but twice.
Yeah, that's what I mean.
You know, that guy's just a lucky stiff.
I wonder ifhe ever gives a thought to where he'd be ifit wasn't foryou.
Wh... You know, even that first night, theydidn't like Jeff's hot music; theylikedyou.
The onlyreason theybought the band is because you were sellin' it.
Hey. What kind of a dog are you, tryin' to make trouble between me and Betty Lou?
Well, it's the truth, ain't it?
Yeah, but I don't like you sayin' it.
Why don'tyou do something about it?
Maybe I will.
Come on. What areya waitin' for?
That's what I thought.
Oh, Jeff! Memphis!
Oh, please! Stop!
- Stop them! Quick!
- Boss! Don't hit him in the lip!
Oh! Oh, Jeff!
Oh, you hurt him, Jeff!
Oh, Memphis, I didn't mean it!
On the level!
Why'd I hityou in the lip? Why couldn't I blacken your eye?
I'll get some ice, get the swelling down.
You think he'll be able to play again? No.
Let me see.
Let me see it.
[Deek] Gee, Jeff, what happened?
Memph! He cut his lip!
Give me some ice, quick!
Louey, get some arnica and some bandages.
Howyou come to slug him?
I don't know.
All of a sudden...
I must be goin' nuts.
You staywhere you are.
I'll take care of Memphis.
Hey, the... The ice!
It's all right, sunshine.
No hard feelings.
Jeff, you want a piece of cake?
No, thanks.

Well, let's go, boys.
You can't blame us, Blackie.
We get a chance to do better, we gotta grab it.
No. Nothin' doin', Jeff.
Uh, I like ya too much.
It'd break my heart to haveyou workin' for somebody else.
It's up toyou, Blackie. Six hundred a week orwe quit Saturday night.

# The people in the ballroom #
# Were stuffy and arty #
# So I began to get just a little bit afraid #
# I sneaked into the kitchen and found me a party #
# The waiter #
# And the porter #
# And the second-story maid #
# I peeked into the parlor to see what was a-hatchin' #
# In time to hear the hostess suggest a charade #
# And who was in the pantry a-laughin' and scratchin' # #The waiter #
# And the porter #
# And the upstairs maid #
# When they heard the music that the orchestra played #
# The waiter and the porter grabbed ahold ofthe maid #
# Then they all proceeded to go into a clog #
# Hot diggety dog #
# If ever I'm invited to some fuddy-duddy's #
# I ain't a-gonna watch any harlequinade #
# You'll find him in the kitchen applaudin' his buddies #
# And that's thewaiter #
# And the porter #
# And the upstairs maid #
# Pardon me, ma'am
You lookjust right #
# Your hair's in place
Your corset's tight #
# Pardon me, sir
There's lots ofice #
# The fire is banked I fixed it twice # [ Laughing ]
# Pardon me, folks
The roast is carved #
# The wine is served
You must be starved #
# Pardon me, sir
Maywe be free #
# The kitchen crowd is havin' a jamboree #
# I went and got a dishpan to use as a cymbal #
# The porter grabbed a regular glass that he played #
# The fingers ofthe waiter were each in a thimble #
# You shoulda heard the music that the combination made #
# Marchin'through the kitchen to the pantryandback #
# Why, man, you shoulda seen us
We was ballin' the jack #
# Once a half an hour passed without any call #
# Jack, we had a ball #
# The waltzes and mazurkas #
# We hate 'em
We spurn 'em #
Yes.
# We got a lot ofrhythms wewanna hear played #
# And we know who to go to when we want to learn 'em #
# The waiter and the porter and the upstairs maid #
That was all right.
How's your lip?
I shoulda been playin' like this a long time ago.
I shoulda poked ya a long time ago.
Now, look, sunshine... Let's go again, boys. Ready?
Where's she goin'?
I told her to go home.
She's not through yet. Ain't
I still runnin' this band?
Sure, sure. For a few minutes, maybe. Look.

That's more important than
Blackie or anything, isn't it?
Why don'tyou go downstairs and leave me alone?
You said ifwe played Chicago, your hot music would sweep the country.
Let's go to Chicago. Blackie can't hurtyou there.
We haven't heard from Chicago.

Besides, I'm not gonna budge until

Everybody should pull up and go to
Chicago so Memphis don't get hurt, huh?

He's gonna sing those two mugs to sleep.
Then we're gonna tiptoe out.

Hey!
Huh?
This setup is all wrong.
What doyou mean?
I've been thinkin'. I don't want to concentrate on one girl.
It wouldn't be fair to all the rest.
Of course not.
Besides, Betty Lou don't want to marry me. She wants to marryyou.
She wants to marry me?
Oh, you're crazy.
I may be crazy, but I'm makin' the boat.

MAN: Do you swear to tell the truth, nothing but the truth, so help you God?
- I do.
- Sit down, please.
You're a professional songwriter,
I believe, Mrs. Crane.
- I am.
- Your husband also?
- Yes.
- You composed love songs together, eh?
- Mostly.
- Who wrote the words?
- I did.
- I see.
And your husband furnished the music?
Oh, no, his music came first,
I furnished the words.
How long did you know the defendant before you married him?
About four and a half years.
And you met him professionally at that time?
Well, um, not exactly, Your Honor.
You see...
Well, he used to come into a little restaurant on 47th Street where I worked.
I used to serve him breakfast every day at 12.
He'd eat 50 cents' worth and I'd only punch 20 on the check.
That's how we became acquainted.
[PEOPLE LAUGHING]
Why did you do that?
I liked him.
Well, don't you think that was dishonest to your employer?
No. I always put the difference on somebody else's check.
[PEOPLE LAUGHING]
I take it Mr. Crane wasn't so successful.
- Well, nobody appreciated him then.
- Except you.
- Well, I didn't count.
- But you encouraged him.
- Yes.
- So you feel you discovered him?
No. Eddie discovered me.
- How?
- I went out with him one night...
[PEOPLE LAUGHING]
Proceed, Mrs. Crane.
Well, we became a habit.
I know, but how did you happen to become a writer of lyrics?
Oh.
Well, I started rewriting
Mother Goose when I was only 6.
Then I wound up writing verses on greeting cards...
...and the firm went bankrupt.
That's when I went into dealing them off the arm.
- Off the arm?
- Yes. You know, like:
Oh, I'm sorry.
I mean, that's when I became a waitress.
- Your Honor, may I interrupt?
MURDOCK: Yes.
I would like Mrs. Crane to tell us how she formed this partnership with her husband.
It's relevant at this point.
Just tell us in your own words,
Mrs. Crane.
Well, it all happened very suddenly one night.
We were sitting in a little gloomy piano room at Max Milton's publishing house.
Max thought Eddie had talent,
so he let him use the room as a favor.
Well, Eddie was working with a lyric writer
on one of the best tunes he ever wrote.
But it was no dice.
I was just sitting there
listening to that piano.
They'd been going on for hours.
Something's wrong.
Maybe it's me or the tune.
I don't know, but I'm not clicking.
Well, you will. You will.
Take your time, Billy.
Look, Eddie, I'll be frank with you.
It's silly for us to waste our time.
I just don't like the tune.
EDDIE:
Oh.
That doesn't mean we can't get together.
That's not the only tune you'll write.
I don't know whether it is or not.
You're taking it too serious, kid.
Pull yourself together. Let's get coffee.
- What do you say?
- Whatever Eddie says.
No, you go ahead.
I'll stick around for a while.
Okay. No hard feelings?
No, certainly not.
And thanks for getting together with me.
Forget it. If you think you got something, give me a jingle.
- I want a hit as much as you. Good night.
EDDIE: Good night.
- Night, Dixie.
- Night.
[DOG WHIMPERS]
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to take it out on you.
Eddie...
...I know you're disappointed, and I don't blame you.
Just because Billy says the tune's no good...
...that doesn't make it so.
Why, it's beautiful.
You don't understand.
It isn't only the song.
It isn't necessarily Billy. It's just that...
Well, in this business you've gotta have a hookup, a team.
There's no sense in writing a tune then peddling it like a hot fur coat...
...from one guy to another hoping to get a fluke hit.
You've gotta work with somebody until you've built a style...
...and a quality that's recognizable.
Look at George Gershwin. He had Ira.
There's Rodgers and Hart,
Kern and Hammerstein.
Oh, what's the use?
There are a dozen more.
They work together.
One helps the other and they go places.
Yeah. I know what you mean.
- Eddie?
- Mm?
Would you mind if a girl wrote the words to your tune?
Of course not. There's Dorothy Fields.
She's one of the best in the business.
Well, could you get her?
No. She's tied up.
Would you listen to some I wrote?
- You?
- Oh...
I know it's ridiculous for me to think that you could think...
...that I could write some words...
...but the melody kept saying the words over and over while you were playing...
...and before I knew it, I had a song.
- You have?
- Uh-huh. You wanna hear it?
- Let me see the words. I can tell by looking.
You couldn't read them.
I jotted them down on my handkerchief.
I always do.
It's, well, kind of unobtrusive.
Well, go ahead and play, Eddie.
But don't laugh, will you?
- The way I feel?
- Well, not in my face, anyhow.
[SINGING] You'll never know
If an apple is ripe
Till you bite it
You'll never know
If a fire is gonna burn
Till you light it
You'll never know
What it means to be blue
Till you've lost an old friend
You'll never know
Just how long is your road
Till you've reached the end
You'll never know
How good a book may be
Till you've read it
You'll never know
What one kind word can do
Till you've said it
You and I could find romance
But, darling, till you take that chance
You'll never, never
Never ever
Know
Dixie, you've done it.
- I don't know how, but you've done it.
- Have I?
Why, it makes me sick, it's so wonderful.
You let me die on the vine for lyrics, and you've got them up your sleeve.
I think it'll swing too.
- I'll bet it will. Let's try it.
- Yeah.
[PLAYING SWING MUSIC]

You'll never know if an apple is ripe

Till you take
That chance
Gosh, Dixie.
Gosh, Eddie.
By golly, that deserves a kiss.
Well, I wouldn't be surprised if Crane and
Donegan had a hit on their handkerchief.
And it was a hit too.
We went to work on another one, which didn't come so easy, incidentally.
But we fought and wrestled it through, and it was successful.
So then I thought it was safe for me to quit my job in the restaurant.
Besides...
...Eddie felt that he could afford to eat in a better place.
I see.
And this successful collaboration led to your marriage.
Yes, Your Honor.
That, plus a little item called love.
MURDOCK:
On whose part?
Well, mine, I guess.
Ah. It didn't last?
I didn't say that.
Oh, one of those.
You love him, but...
BLANTON:
Your Honor, may I interrupt once more?
Yes.
I would like to call a witness if the court pleases.
Someone altogether impartial who could clarify this portion of the case.
Yes. I think it's going to need a little clarity. Go ahead.
That will be all for the time being,
Mrs. Crane.
Miss Marilyn Marsh, please.
CLERK: Name, please?
- Marilyn Marsh.
CLERK:
Raise your right hand.
Do you swear to tell the truth, nothing but the truth, so help you God?
- I do.
- Sit down, please.
Will you tell the court your occupation or profession?
I'm a dancer.
You've appeared in Broadway productions?
I have.
How long have you known
Mr. And Mrs. Crane?
Over three years. Ever since they started writing songs together.
- Before they were married?
- Yes, sir.
They wrote the score for a show I was in, and we became very close friends.
In fact, I think Dixie is my very best friend.
What was the relationship between
Miss Donegan and Mr. Crane at that time?
Well, I'm not sure.
But in your opinion they seemed suited to one another?
I thought the match was made in heaven.
- But it didn't work out that way?
- No, sir.
I'm afraid they still make most of the matches in Sweden.
[PEOPLE LAUGHING]
[GAVEL BANGS]
Miss Marsh, please confine yourself to less philosophical statements.
I'm sorry.
What I mean is, it was a flop.
In what way?
- Well...
- To sum it up definitely, Miss Marsh...
...what would say was the basic trouble between Mr. And Mrs. Crane?
Why...
Why, I'd say Eddie went Park Avenue.
Park Avenue?
Can you explain in a little more detail just what you mean by that?
Well, for example, there was the night the show closed.
It had run for a year...
...and Dixie and Eddie were giving a big party for the cast and all their friends.
Only it turned out to be mostly for his friends, his new ones.
Park Avenue was clustered around Eddie
like flies around honey.
Every phony in the phony 400.
On the other side of the room,
Dixie and I were sitting...
... and I couldn't help noticing
she was depressed.
I think everybody felt the room
was split up into two camps.
The friends who knew him when,
and those that knew him if.
Among his real friends
were Max Milton, his publisher.
He'd handled every song
the kids had written...
... and was kind of a godfather
to both of them.
And Red Willet, the song plugger.
He'd gone up with Eddie and so he put in
a special plug for all his tunes.
And with us was one of the most popular
radio singers in the country...
... Buddy Crawford.
We'd all known Buddy
when he was just starting out...
... and we'd watched his struggles
along with our own.
But he was on top now, and was always
singing every Crane and Donegan tune...
... he could get hold of.
Maybe we're wrong, Red.
Maybe he belongs with these hammerheads, after all.
It isn't that bad, Marilyn.
He's just a big kid.
He's found a new sand pile to play in.
Yeah, and a golden bucket.
Can they spare it?
I guess it's perfectly natural.
Eddie come up the hard way.
When I plugged his first number 10 years ago, he didn't have a cot to sleep in.
You can't blame him if he wants to eat caviar...
...and go to Lady Triple Chin's house parties.
I'm thinking of Dixie.
It's tough on her.
It's like the gag: You don't run after a streetcar once you've caught it.
- Marilyn, you look wonderful.
- Oh, thanks, Buddy.
Red, stand up a minute, will you?
Turn around.
Thank you.
Oh, I get it, you two want me to be alone.
That's the general idea.
Where's your girl?
There she is, over there.
Cute kid, isn't she?
Yeah. What's her name?
- Lull.
- Lull?
Lull doesn't seem to be having a very good time.
Aw, she's happy. She's eating.
Oh, a pickle for Lull. Thank you.
Hi, Lull.
Having a lot of fun?
You know, you're gonna ruin your appetite if you don't stop eating between bites.
- Simply fabulous.
- Out of the world.
- Wonderful.
- I'm glad you like it because I love to play.
Oh, Eddie, it's been simply divine.
The whole evening.
- I'm absolutely shattered I have to go.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
But you will join us this weekend?
At the Lattisons'.
You want me to come and bring my piano?
- Don't be silly.
- Eddie, how fantastic.
- We want you for yourself.
- That's kind of you.
I still have never been able to get one of these things in a taxi.
- Maybe I can stay for just one more.
- Oh, good.
- Oh, please.
- Yes, come on. Just one more, huh?
Say, Dixie, wasn't it a swell party?
Everybody said they couldn't have had a better time.
Did you meet that real live countess?
You mean the lady with the slight mustache?
Yeah.
And that society columnist?
Oh, yes.
You should have heard him rave about your tune.
Yeah?
He asked me what we're gonna do next...
...and I told him an idea of that number we talked about last.
Oh, I don't think that's so hot.
Oh, everybody loves a love song in spring.
I'm sure we can get it.
Look, Eddie, I dare you.
- Lets go in and run it over right now?
- Now?
We've always worked any hour of the day or night.
Oh, no, honey. I don't feel like it.
I'm not in the mood.
Tomorrow then?
Well, maybe. We'll see.
No, I just remembered.
I'm going down to the Sound to see the Marions' new boat.
They certainly liked our party.
I got a thrill out of looking around that room tonight.
You know something? I'll bet we had
150 million bucks right in that living room.
Uh-huh.
Did you see all the invitations we got?
Twenty, I'll bet you.
- Did my blue suit go to the cleaners?
- Yes.
- When do I get my laundry?
- Tomorrow at 10:00.
Do you know if those brown shoes were picked up?
The bootmaker will have them here Friday.
We've ordered your favorite lobster and the butler's reordered the wine you like.
Anything else, Eddie?
What's the matter?
I didn't know you were that tired tonight.
There are a lot of things I'm tired of.
What did you mean by that?
Eddie...
...let's shake hands and call it quits.
Quits?
You see, this whole business is your idea of fun, it isn't mine.
I think you could have a better time alone.
I wanna work. I'm a worker.
I can't stand this routine of bouncing red balloons in the air.
But it's your idea of a merry-go-round, darling.
So you ride on it.
Oh, I get it.
My balloons, my merry-go-round.
As if you weren't having a good time yourself.
If that isn't a typical feminine attitude, always making the man the heavy.
Oh, let's not fight about it, Eddie.
It really only dawned on me tonight.
Maybe I ought to have my freedom.
Legally.
Well...
...you know I'd never stand in the way of what you wanna do.
That's white of you, Eddie.
As long as we don't see things the same way, what's the use of going on?
No use.
No use at all.
And we won't.
That's the whole story, as I pieced it together from my own impressions...
...and the things Dixie told me.
As Red said, I'm afraid Eddie figured he'd caught the streetcar...
...and didn't have to run anymore.
Hm.
Well, thank you, Miss Marsh.
That will be all.
Are there any other witnesses?
No, sir. My case rests.
Is the defendant represented in court?
No. Since there's no question of support or property settlement...
...the case is not contested.
All right.
Well, from the evidence we've heard today...
...we seem to have a regrettable instance of a young man...
...who wasn't able to handle his own success.
Even made it intolerable for this young woman to live with him.
Funny what a little success will do to people.
Well, much as I dislike this divorce business...
...there doesn't seem to be anything to do here.
There are no children.
No question of money and certainly sufficient legal grounds.
Therefore, I grant this divorce.
[GAVEL BANGS]
Court's adjourned.
It's all over now, honey, you're as free as a bird.
Thanks to you, Marilyn.
If anybody got my divorce for me, you did.
We're going to my place and celebrating.
You're swell to take me in, honey.
Oh, gosh, it's staring to rain.
Wouldn't it, though?
Today of all days.
I don't mind. It's Eddie's blue suit.
- He always wants it when it rains.
- Eddie's blue suit?
We'll stop at the cleaners and make sure they send it to him.
Eddie may not have me, but he's gonna have his darned old blue serge suit.
Gosh, I loved Eddie in that suit.
Divine.
Too divine.
Too, too divine.
Shove, dove, wove, glove...
- Hi, Dixie.
- Hello, honey.
- Working?
- Trying to, and getting nowhere but fast.
Any calls for me, darling?
The phone rang, but when I answered there wasn't anyone on the wire.
- How are the lyrics going?
- Oh, I guess I'm upset.
This is the third fellow
I've tried to write with, and it's no use.
But I'll find one if I have to put an ad in Variety.
[PHONE RINGS]
I'll get it.
Hello? Oh, uh...
Just a minute. I'll see.
- It's Eddie.
- Eddie?
Now, don't be overanxious.
Play hard to get.
I'm afraid she's gone out.
I'll see if I can catch her.
Do something so you'll sound out of breath.
Run around the room.
Run to the door. Go on.
[DOG BARKING]
Hold the wire, Eddie,
I managed to catch her.
Hello, Eddie.
I'm sorry I'm a little out of breath.
I just came in.
Marilyn caught me way down the hall.
I'm sorry to bother you if you're going out.
Well, it is fairly important.
I was wondering if you could run over here for few minutes.
You will? Oh, that's swell.
You're a darling.
I'll be right over.
Oh, it's something important, he said.
Marilyn, do you suppose?
Oh, gee.
[DOORBELL BUZZES]
[CLEARS THROAT]
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, Dixie.
Come on in.
Thanks.
- May I take your cape?
- Oh, yes.
I can't stay long, people are waiting, you know?
Oh, sure, sure. As a matter of fact,
I expect some people by here pretty soon.
- Won't you sit down?
- Oh, thanks.
Oh, uh, cigarette?
- It's empty.
- Oh.
[DIXIE LAUGHS]
Well, never mind,
I just finished one in the cab.
Well...
...how are things, Eddie?
Oh, fine, fine.
I've been pretty busy lately.
Oh, you've been writing?
No. Been moving around a lot, though.
- You know, parties and stuff.
- Oh.
I was down at the Lessmores' yesterday on Long Island. I had a swell time.
I bet you did.
Well, what about you?
- Have you been working?
- Me? Oh, sure.
You know me. The sewing machine kid.
- Well, is it good?
- Oh, swell, I think.
I found a new writer just the other day.
He seems to work out fine.
Oh, I'm glad.
You wanted to see me, Eddie?
Yeah.
You see...
...it's like this, Dixie.
I guess I'm not as smart as I thought I was.
Oh?
No. I found out that living alone isn't quite what it's cracked up to be.
I used to be able to find everything.
Socks and shirts and neckties.
At least they were put where I could kind of dive into them like a fireman.
Yes, Eddie?
Well, the truth is, Dixie, that...
Well, it takes a woman to run things.
Yes, Eddie?
And now those crumbs have walked out on me.
What crumbs?
The servants. They took a powder.
I don't know where anything is.
Even how to hire new ones.
That's why I phoned you.
I thought you'd give me a hand.
You thought that...?
If it wasn't too much trouble, you could...
Well, you know, tell me what to do.
You mean you brought me over here to tell you how to call up an employment agency?
- I didn't. You volunteered.
- Are you implying...?
I'm not implying anything except
I don't know how to run an apartment.
I gave them a vacation.
They walked in, walked out on me.
- They didn't even give me notice.
- Probably couldn't find you.
Look at this apartment.
And that dust and those ashes.
And look at that piano.
I'm admitting it.
All I need's a little advice.
- All you need is advice.
- Oh, I'm getting along swell.
You sound as though you're feeling sorry for yourself.
You always were a sentimentalist, my boy.
- That's why you were a great songwriter.
- What do you mean "were"?
Just that. You haven't written a thing since you had an empty stomach.
"Were," indeed.
- What's this? One of your shirts?
- I don't know.
Go on, open it up.
A dust cloth.
Come on, open it again.
Oh.
Hey, don't throw that away.
It's a new tune.
New? It's been hanging around here for over a year.
I know, but I was gonna work on it tomorrow.
Oh, yeah, mañana.
Don't throw away anything with notes on it.
- It might go down in history.
- Mm-hm.
You and Beethoven.
[HUMMING]
Say, that's not bad.
What's that?
I never heard that part before.
- What?
- The middle.
When did you write it?
Quiet. I'm trying to get it now.
- Start it again.
- Huh?
From the beginning. I got an idea.
Okay.
Play the first four bars again.
Play it again, Eddie.
Just the last two bars.
That did it, brother.
- You finished?
- Yeah. Wanna hear it?
Of course. I hope the last part's as good as the first.
[MUMBLES]
[SINGING] My music couldn't compare
With Liszt's or Schumann's
Or gifted humans
Like Irving Berlin and Jerry Kern
[SINGING] My lyrics aren't in a class
With Ira Gershwin
From Ira Gershwin
I've lots to learn
If our talents we combined
I think they might agree
You mean, I'd bring out the Kern in you
And you'd bring out the Gershwin in me
Could be
Could be
Your words
And my music
Could make such a beautiful song
A simple chorus as warm as the spring
We'll get our big thrill
When we hear
Everyone singing
Your words
And my music
And although its theme may be worn
With your words
And my music
A wonderful love song
Is born
It's perfect, darling.
- You sure it doesn't sound forced?
- No. It's right on the nose.
Plenty of sentiment.
It's exactly what the tune means to me.
- Oh, I think it's swell, honey.
- I'm glad.
There's just this one little part in the bass here.
- Eddie.
- Huh?
I'm dead. I'm gonna call it a night.
All right, honey.
When we get up we'll listen to it again.
Okay, that's a good idea.
Night, darling.
Night.
You know, honey, I think this is...
You know, Dixie, I think that's the most commercial tune we've ever written.
Mm-hm.
Say, you don't look very comfortable.
Hey, wake up and go to sleep.
Oh, yeah.
[EDDIE HUMMING]
Tired.
- Eddie.
- Hm?
- Zip, will you?
- Oh.
Thanks.
[DIXIE SCREAMS]
What's the matter?
Oh, dear.
- Hey, where are you going?
- I don't live here anymore.
Gee, my beads.
Well, if...
Sorry, my mistake.
It gets worse every year.
What happened to you?
Oh, I got out of one those new cabs.
I forgot there was no running board.
- No what?
- Running board.
I got out in a hurry and it wasn't there...
- lf I find a lawyer, I'm gonna sue the guy.
- Take it easy, Red.
Hi, Buddy... oh, I'm sorry.
You look just like Buddy Crawford.
Better watch that.
- Hi, Buddy.
- Hello, Red.
- Have you heard it yet?
- Heard what?
Eddie and Dixie wrote a new tune.
And is it terrific.
What do you know?
When can I hear it?
Well, I'll sing it for you right now.
MAN:
Calling Mr. Crawford.
Did that come out of me?
[LAUGHS]
MAN: Calling Mr. Crawford.
- Here you are, fellow.
You got me off-key there.
- Is she on the phone?
- Yes. Booth 3.
- I'll handle it. I'll tell her you're out of town.
- I'll handle it.
Well, how about the new song?
- Hello, Dixie.
- Hello, Buddy, how are you?
Yes, the former Mrs. Crane speaking.
I got your flowers this morning, they're beautiful.
You wouldn't be kidding me, would you?
Kidding on the square. Now that you're back in circulation, how about giving me a break?
- What are you doing the next two months?
- Oh, take it easy. Take it easy.
Buddy, I'm in Max Milton's office and we want you to come over...
...to hear a new song
Eddie and I have written.
Yes, congratulations.
Joe was just telling me.
I'd love you to sing it for me.
In fact, I'd love you. Period.
Hi, Red.
Oh, hello, Eddie.
Say, I've been plugging your new song.
- How's it going? Do people like it?
- Nuts about it. I sang it for Buddy.
He raved. He wants to use it on the air right away.
That's nice of him.
He'll do a great job on it.
- Sell a lot of copies.
- Yeah.
I was just thinking, too bad you and Dixie split out.
We'll have to send the royalties in two checks, huh?
- Yeah.
- I guess you don't feel too hot about it.
- Oh, forget it. I don't like to talk about it.
- Yeah, that's the way it goes.
When love flies out the window, it always leaves a scar.
I guess you don't feel too good, do you, kid?
I mean, Dixie's so marvelous.
Well, of course, it's none of my business, but you look terrible.
- I guess she gave you the air, huh?
- Why, we're still the best of friends.
- Uh-oh. That's a sure sign it's off for keeps.
- Oh, shut up, will you?
Well, you don't have to get sore.
- What's the matter, Eddie?
- Where's Buddy?
He's over there making a phone call.
Guy brought a note in for...
EDDIE:
Hey, Crawford.
- Hello, Eddie.
- I wanna see you, you...
- Why, you sound mad.
- I am.
- At me?
- Yes, you, you...
- You heel.
- Why, Eddie, what's eating you?
- I figured you might be the guy.
- What guy?
The snake in the grass.
- Aren't you being just a little silly?
- I am, am I?
- How would you like a punch?
- For what?
- For trying to chisel in on my wife.
- Oh, use your head.
Yeah. You haven't got a wife.
- You were talking to her on the phone.
- About business.
Don't kid me. What business would she have with you?
Well, now, you'd be surprised.
Oh, I would? Why, I'll...
- You dope. Think of his public.
- Get out of here.
- I know what I'm doing.
- Look.
- Dixie wrote a new song.
- We wrote a new song.
Did you hear that? We.
I don't care how many of you wrote the song.
Dixie wants me to sing it.
"Your Words And My Music" is one song you'll never sing.
- Yes, I will.
- You won't.
Say, this is a new angle in song plugging.
If Dixie wants me to sing it,
I'm gonna sing it.
You do, and I'll knock it back in your teeth.
Hey, Buddy.
Now, ladies and gentlemen...
...I would like to sing for the first time, a song written by Miss Dixie Donegan...
...and Mr. Eddie Crane.
[AUDIENCE APPLAUDING]
It's always a pleasure to introduce any song of theirs...
...especially since my very lovely little friend Miss Dixie Donegan...
...is our guest here tonight.
Well, how do you like that?
You ought to take a poke at that guy.
You can't tell me she's not stuck on him.
I'm not trying to.
[SINGING]
Your words
And my music
Could make such a beautiful song
A simple chorus
As warm as the spring
We'll get our big thrill

And my music

Boy, when he sings like that
I gotta forgive him.
Yeah.
You can't blame Dixie for falling for him.
With your words
And my music
A wonderful love song
Is born
That's fine, Mr. Crawford.
You can now go over and sit with the very lovely Miss Donegan.
Eddie, why don't you go to bed and get a good night's sleep?
Sleep? Are you kidding?
Well, then let's go out someplace where we can get a drink.
No.
Oh, don't take it so tough, kid.
Suppose they do get married.
There's always a chance they won't get along.
Look at your own case.
[SINGING]
Your words
My music
Could make a beautiful song

We'll get our big thrill
We'll get our big thrill

I wonder where I parked my car.

My tune
Such a lovely love song is born

Hello, Lull.
Gee, I didn't know you couldn't sing.
Hello, chums.
- Hello.
- I just caught you on the air, Buddy.
- No kidding, you were terrific.
- Gee, thanks.
- Even Eddie had to admit it.
- Well.
- Eddie?
- We were listening up at his place.
- Why didn't you bring him along?
- I tried to, but he was too tired.
He'd rather stay home all night over a hot torch.
I never saw such a guy.
The minute he heard you were with Buddy, he starts to burn.
Oh, but this is strictly business,
Buddy's our salesman.
Don't give me that old
"business" business.
MARILYN: Say, Red.
- Yes?
Why don't you open that little door and fly back into the clock?
Open what door?
What clock?
Oh. Yeah.
Well, what are you in hysterics about?
Good evening, Mr. Crane.
- Where's Miss Donegan's table?
- Oh, she's right over there.
Thanks.
Hello.
Well, as I live and breathe, it's Torchy.
Hello, Eddie.
MARILYN:
Why, Eddie, Red said you'd gone to bed.
Oh, yeah. Well, I just went down to the corner to get a paper...
...and on the way back,
I saw the lights burning...
...so I thought I'd drop in.
- Well, sit down.
- Thanks.
Eddie, I'm sorry about the misunderstanding at the club.
It wasn't any misunderstanding.
I just have to be careful about my hands on account of playing the piano.
- Well, what happened?
- Oh, it wasn't anything.
Just a little argument.
Eddie went out and left Buddy standing there.
Dixie, I wanna talk to you.
Well, all right.
No, I mean, alone.
Well, I'll just send everybody home, huh?
No, Dixie, I'm in earnest.
Well, I'm in a party, so you'll just have to wait.
This steak big enough, sir?
Well, just a moment.
Would you try that for size?
- Bring two of those.
- Two?
Yeah, one for me and another one for her.
Now I'd like to present, for the first time at the Club Sirocco...
...three solid citizens who are definitely out of this world.
And at all times, they are really cooking with gas.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Berry Brothers.
[SINGING]
Ah
You'll never know
If an apple is ripe
Till you bite it
You bite it
[SCATTING]
Whoa
You'll never know
If fire's going to burn
Till you light it
You light it
You strike a match and light it
Say, you'll never know
What it means to be blue
Till you've lost an old friend
You'll never know
Just how long is the road
Till you've reached
The
Until
You've
Reached the end
You'll never, never know
That you've got a friend
You'll never know
How good a book is
Till you read it
You really, really do, yeah
You'll never know
What a kind word can do
Till you said it
You need to say it
But if you say it
You and I could find romance
But, honey
Till you take that chance
You'll never, never, never ever
No, you'll never ever, never
Never ever, ever
Never know
If you can spare me for a moment,
I'll dance with Marilyn.
Why, certainly, Buddy.
Dixie, let's get out of here.
Well, I can't leave now.
- Why not?
- Because I came with Buddy.
I can't be rude to him.
Well, I can and it would be a pleasure.
Oh, Eddie, you're a big boy now.
I'm big enough to know that Buddy's not to blame.
You're not being very pleasant.
I'm beginning to realize what's really cooking.
- What do you mean?
- You're chasing after him.
Never a dull moment, I often say.
And what's more, if that's what you want, you got it.
But count me out.
[BUZZES]
Hello, darling.
Oh, hello, Marilyn.
Hello, Eddie. Come in.
What, more flowers?
- Well, l...
- Say, I could choke you.
I've done nothing all day but unwrap these flowers, and all for Dixie.
You know, I live here too.
You could have at least sent me a piece of lettuce or something.
Oh, I'm sorry, Marilyn.
Gee, they look kind of lost in here, at that.
If you'd been on your toes...
...you would have ordered a nice big weeping willow for the middle of the room.
- I thought Dixie was gonna be here.
- She should be here any moment now.
A breakfast date at 11, luncheon date at 12.
Oh, breakfast and luncheon, huh?
You think she could sandwich me in around tea time? Just between crumpets?
Oh, I think so, Eddie.
She hasn't planned anything till dinner.
I hope she wasn't sore about last night.
I didn't mean to crash your party at the club but I wanted to tell her something and...
Well, I guess I kind of lost my temper.
Is she very mad at me?
I don't think she gave it another thought.
I'm terribly relieved.
Hello, baby.
Gee, are the flowers still coming?
- Hello.
- Hello, Dixie.
I'm sorry to be late, Eddie.
Darling, any calls for me?
Yeah, phone's been jangling like an ambulance.
- The messages are on your table.
- Oh, I'll have to phone back later.
You wanted to work, didn't you?
- I certainly do.
- Well, I'll hold everybody off.
We have to be ready early tonight.
We're going to Westchester.
I'll jump right in the tub with the lilacs.
Eddie, the flowers are beautiful.
I feel kind of silly getting so many.
Didn't you feel kind of silly sending them?
No, I felt all right.
Here's a little garnish on the side.
More?
Oh, and another one.
Oh. It's from Buddy.
Now, isn't that sweet?
- Say, Dixie, about last night...
- Let's not talk about last night, Eddie.
No personalities between us.
I didn't mean that.
I meant that melody I was talking about.
I got a hunch if we get steamed up now we can knock this town dead.
- Really?
- Sure. Only we gotta work more.
We gotta work harder.
We gotta work mornings, afternoons, evenings.
Work, work, work till we get it.
Oh, you can do it, Dixie.
You write wonderful lyrics.
Why, as a team, we could be tops.
If we get to winging we could write the words and music to that Hopkins show.
Now, how would you like that?
- Oh, it's a pretty tough assignment.
- Oh, that's no way to talk.
A couple of more hits and we'll be a cinch.
Nothing's too tough.
- I'm busy. I've got a dinner date tonight.
- Cancel it.
Doesn't a career mean anything to a gal with talent like you got? Come on, Dixie.
Get out that old hanky.
Here. Here's the way it starts.
Oh, Eddie, I don't feel like it.
I'm not in the mood.
Oh, you can do it, kid.
Get in there and slug.
Come on, Dixie. Make with those good old Donegan words.
Well, I'll try. Play it over again.
Attagirl, baby, turn on the heat.
[DIXIE HUMMING]
[SINGING] My one and only
I am so lonely
I can't believe that it's really you
Somehow it's just too good to be true
You are the sweetest
You are so lovely
So sweet and lovely
Oh, sweet and lovely
Hey. "oh, sweet and lovely."
Oh, sweet and lovely
Can it be true
You are the one
Baby, be mine
Baby, be mine.
Oh, sweet and lovely
Baby, be mine
Baby, be good
Lady, be good
That's it. "Lady, be good."
Oh, sweet and lovely
Lady, be good
Yeah.
Oh, sweet and lovely
Lady, be good
Oh, lady, be good to me
How's that?
I am so awfully misunderstood
So, lady, be good to me
Oh, I don't know what to say now
Oh, please have some pity
Pity, pity, pity. What rhymes with pity?
Kitty, ditty, witty, city.
City.
Oh, please have some pity
I'm all alone in this big city
Wait a minute.
I got myself all alone now.
I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood
So lady, be good to me
- oh, honey, that's swell.
- You think so?
Lt'll be a smash.
Wait till Max hears this.
Yeah. When he hears it, he'll take out his cigar, flip off the ashes and say:
"Well, kids, if I'm any judge,
I think we got a hit in our hands."
I hope so.
Oh, sweet and lovely
Lady, be good
Oh, lady, be good to me
- I am so awfully...
- Misunderstood.
Misunderstood
So, lady, be good to me
Oh, please have some pity
I'm all alone in this big city
I tell you, I'm just a lonesome
Babe in the wood
So, lady, be good to me
- Well?
- Well?
Well, kids, if I'm any judge,
I think we've got a hit on our hands.
Get me an arranger.

[MAN SPEAKING RAPIDLY
ON RADIO]
[EDDIE MOUTHING]
MAN [ON RADIO]:
Now, ladies and gentlemen...
... number one on your hit parade...
... for the 10th consecutive week,
"Lady Be Good."
["LADY BE GOOD" PLAYS ON RADIO]
Fellow members and guests.
Obviously, this is not an official meeting of our organization.
The food was too good.
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]
Every once in a while we can meet unofficially...
...without discussing songwriting or the problems of song publishing.
I might say we are forced to meet socially at times.
Now, don't get me wrong.
I mean that one of our members, or perhaps two, as is the case tonight...
...have distinguished themselves so it is impossible for us to ignore the fact...
...that a proper tribute is due to them and should be paid.
[AUDIENCE APPLAUDING]
On these occasions in the past, we've honored such beloved members...
...as victor Herbert, George Gershwin,
Oscar Hammerstein, and Jerome Kern.
This is our opportunity to show our appreciation to these members...
...who've helped make the
Songwriters and Publishers Association...
...the truly great organization it is.
A few months ago, an established songwriting team decided to split up.
In the vernacular of Tin Pan Alley...
...the perfect wedding of words and music were divorced.
But I'm sure that all of you share my happiness...
...in knowing that Dixie Donegan and
Eddie Crane are working together again.
And once more they've written themselves to the very pinnacle of our profession.
Whatever else has happened is none of my business or yours.
What matters to us is that they've given the world another great song.
And when you hear Dixie sing it,
I think you'll feel as I do:
That this isn't just another work by two songwriters.
It's as if they had a hundred million collaborators.
The Americans who feel in their hearts...
...what Eddie and Dixie have written so beautifully in their song.
I refer to the tender and affectionate salute to a lost city...
..."The Last Time I Saw Paris."
[SINGING] A lady known as Paris
Romantic and charming
Has left her old companions
And faded from view
Lonely men with lonely eyes
Are seeking her in vain
Her streets are where they were
But there's no sign of her
She has left
The Seine
The last time I saw Paris
Her heart was warm and gay
I heard the laughter of her heart
In every street café
The last time saw Paris
Her trees were dressed for spring
And lovers walked beneath those trees
And birds found songs to sing
I dodged the same old taxicabs
That I had dodged for years
The chorus of their squeaky horns
Was music to my ears
The last time I saw Paris
Her heart was warm and gay
No matter how they change her
I'll remember her
That way
I'll think of happy hours
And people who shared them
Old women selling flowers
In markets at dawn
Children who applauded Punch and Judy
In the park
And those who danced at night
And kept our Paris bright
Till the town
Went dark
The last time I saw Paris
Her heart was warm and gay
I heard the laughter of her heart
In every street café
The last time I saw Paris
Her trees were dressed for spring
And lovers walked beneath those trees
And birds found songs to sing
I dodged the same old taxicabs
That I had dodged for years
The chorus of their squeaky horns
Was music to my ears
The last time I saw Paris
Her heart was warm and gay
No matter how
They change her
I'll remember her
That way
- oh, gee. That was terrific, wasn't it?
- Mm-hm.
We've come a long way from Tin Pan Alley, honey.
Funny.
I was remembering too.
That was a swell speech that Max made about us, wasn't it?
Wonderful.
"The perfect wedding of words and music," he said.
- Remember?
- Mm-hm.
Oh, Dixie, why can't we make it a real wedding again?
Can't we?
Can't we?
I think our present arrangement is very good for us.
- What's good about it?
- Well, you're...
I mean, we're writing again.
Oh, I can write under any circumstances.
- Except when we're married.
- That's ridiculous.
No, it isn't.
You're ambitious now, Eddie.
You want things.
That's an awful good sign, wanting things.
Oh, it is, is it?
If all you want is the writing I can do, we'd better call the whole thing off.
Oh, but, darling,
I've enjoyed your company too.
- Thanks. Thanks too much.
- Oh, Eddie, don't you understand?
All I understand is everything was swell...
...until you twisted me around your finger and talked me into a divorce.
- I talked you...?
- Yes, you did, don't argue, it's true.
And then a very funny thing.
All of a sudden that palooka of a sob singer appears on the scene.
Don't be so darn silly.
You have no reason to be jealous.
I'm not jealous.
But will you kindly explain
Buddy Crawford?
But he's jealous of you.
He's jealous of...?
Why, the conceit of the guy.
I never heard of such a thing.
- That's what I tell him.
- Oh, you do, do you?
Well, I'm tired of the whole setup.
This is the end.
You can't make a chump out of me.
I know what's going on.
I'm not gonna stand for it.
Come back here and behave yourself.
Now, you think I'm blind?
I wasn't born yesterday.
- Say, who writes your corny material?
- Never mind.
You won't have to put up with it any longer.
From now on, I'll go my way and you can go yours.
[CAR HORN HONKING]
Hello, Marilyn.
- Hello, Buddy.
- Hi.
- Forgive me for phoning you.
- I like to hear from the girl I'm gonna marry.
Mr. Crawford, isn't this rather sudden?
Have you asked your mother's consent?
She told me when I found a girl crazy about me...
...just go right ahead and marry her, so we're all set.
Well, wasn't that sweet of her?
No, seriously, I wanna talk to you about the divorce.
Well, what about our children?
No, all joking aside, Buddy.
I'm really worried about Dixie's divorce.
We've got to do something about it.
I thought the judge did a fair job on it.
- What's there left for us to do?
- We've got to get them back together.
She's really madly in love with Eddie, and I think he is with her.
What do you want me to do? Put him on my knee and be a mother to him?
- I have a good idea.
- I have a better one.
- You and I get married. Set an example.
- Now, now, now. I've got it all planned.
We've gotta do something to make Eddie jealous.
That guy's so jealous, you can hear him sizzle on a clear day.
That's the point. It only needs one gesture on your part.
My part? Listen, I almost got punched in the nose for no good reason at all.
You know that guy's temper.
What are you trying to cook up, a homicide?
Now, don't be frightened, junior.
Mother won't let you get hurt. I only want you to send Dixie a diamond ring.
A diamond what? Hey, what is this?
When Eddie hears that, he'll have Dixie in front of a preacher...
...before you can get the ring back.
This has gone far enough.
I refuse to be made a...
You're a dear, Buddy. When you pick out the ring, be sure it's big.
- But suppose she accepts it?
- Accept a ring from you?
Oh, don't be ridiculous, darling.
Well, how do I like that?
Hello, Buttons.
Oh, have I got a surprise for you.
Come on, look what I have.
Come here. Buttons.
Come here. Stand up.
Stand up. Speak.
[BARKING]
Oh! Marilyn, you scared me to death.
Come here, darling.
There. Don't you say thank you?
Oh, he never says a word.
What are you doing on the floor?
Working on some steps for my new number.
Oh, it looks great.
MARILYN:
Yeah, now if I can just do what I draw.
DIXIE: Marilyn, you just worry about drawing what you do.
How come you and Eddie didn't work today?
Oh, we were going to, but we had kind of an argument last night after the banquet.
After Max's swell speech about you?
I thought you two would be back together again for keeps.
What a spot to be in.
A woman who doesn't dare marry her own husband.
MARILYN:
Now, let's see.
[MARILYN HUMMING
"LADY BE GOOD"]
[TAPPING]
[DOG BARKING]
What's the matter, Buttons?
Oh.
[WHISTLES "LADY BE GOOD"]
Well, come on.
Oh, so you wanna get in on this thing too, huh?
Thought you did.
Come on, faster.
Come on, once more. Come on.
Come on.
Now, sit down. I got work to do.
[HUMMING]
Then:
Now for a little music.
["LADY BE GOOD" PLAYS]
Oh, so you don't like the hula, huh?
Bet you can't do it.
[LAUGHING]
Sounded good. How did it go?
MARILYN:
Oh, pretty good, Dixie.
They just phoned from downstairs to tell us to get the horse out of the apartment.
[MARILYN LAUGHS]
Oh, look at this room.
MARILYN:
Well, wait a minute. I'll help.
[DOORBELL BUZZES]
Oh, wait a minute. I'll get it.
It might be somebody...
- Mrs. Edward Crane?
- Yes.
Sign here, lady.
- Surprise?
- I think so.
Oh, it's simply beautiful, Dixie.
- Why, I might have chosen it myself.
- Marilyn.
Who's it from?
Oh, no card, but I know.
- Buddy?
- Uh-huh.
- Buddy? Oh, heavens, no. Eddie.
- Oh.
After last night's scene, this is his way of apologizing.
He always does something like this to take my mind off the real issue.
[PHONE RINGING]
- Oh. That's Eddie.
- Oh, I'll get it.
It's probably for me.
I'm expecting a call.
Hello? Hello, Eddie. This is Marilyn.
[DOORBELL BUZZES]
Oh.
- Hello, Dixie.
- Hello, Buddy.
- Can I come in?
- Oh, of course.
Oh, well, come in.
Thank you.
Oh, can I take your hat?
- That's a lovely new ring you're wearing.
- Yes.
How did you guess it was new?
I didn't have to guess it was new.
I knew it was new.
- How do you like it?
- Oh, Buddy, I think it's beautiful.
Thank you.
Darling, it looks exactly like you.
Buddy.
Well, we are engaged, aren't we?
Oh, Buddy, you didn't send...
Well, I thought Eddie...
- oh, you did send it, didn't you?
- Well, what's so awful about that?
- Nothing. I couldn't possibly...
- You keep that thing on.
I want Marilyn to know about this.
I want the whole world to know about it.
- No... You mustn't...
- Let me do the talking from now on.
- From now on I'll do the talking.
- I couldn't take this.
Well, anyway, I thought you'd like to know she got the ring.
And is she thrilled. It's beautiful.
What ring? I never sent her a ring.
Well, somebody did.
And it's a diamond too.
And it's as big as an ink well.
What?
I don't know what's going on, but I'm coming over to find out.
Tell her I think I'll bring a gun and cause some trouble.
I'm not gonna stand for this.
Gun? Oh, Eddie, I was only kidding.
Honestly.
I didn't mean for you to go that far.
Hello, Eddie? Eddie? Gun?
- You've made me the happiest man.
- Dixie, come quick.
I've gotta see you alone for a moment.
Please, hurry. Hurry.
Hello, Buddy.
Something awful has happened.
That was Eddie on the phone.
- He's got a gun. He's on his way here.
- A gun? What for?
- He's gonna shoot somebody. Probably you.
- Me?
- Yes. Come on.
- You didn't tell him about the ring?
Well, I might have mentioned it.
But I didn't know he was a killer.
Help me get into my things.
- All right.
- I don't wanna get shot looking like this.
Hey, driver, quit dragging your feet.
I'm in a hurry.
Never mind your hat.
[DIXIE SCREAMS]
MARILYN: What's the matter?
- Is that my picture?
Not yet. Come on, we better hurry.
We've gotta hit the road.
Come on, Buddy.
- Come on, Buddy.
- Hey, what's happened?
[DOORBELL BUZZING]
Too late.
- What'll we do?
- Who is it?
- It's Eddie.
- So what?
- He's got a gun.
- He's gonna shoot us.
- Hide.
- Let's hide. Get behind the curtain.
- You get behind the curtain.
- No, you.
Why should I hide? You hide.
He's after you, not me. I hope.
Come on, Buddy.
Sit down and act natural.
Well, it's my apartment.
I guess I'll have to face him.
- Hey, Dixie.
- What?
Will you hide? He can see you.
Eddie, don't shoot. Don't shoot.
I can explain everything. It's all my fault.
- Where is Dixie?
- She's not exactly here.
- She sort of went out.
- Well, I'll find out if she did or not.
- Hello.
- Now I know she's here.
- Where's my wife?
- Married again? Congratulations.
- Trot her out.
- How? She's not here. Look for yourself.
- I suppose you two were alone, huh?
- Why not?
- Yeah, why not?
- We like it.
I know which way the wind's blowing.
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Buddy and I've been good friends for a long time.
We've been more than just good friends.
We've been...
Haven't we?
- Absolutely.
- There you are, the man admits it.
Pretty smart, Marilyn, but I don't believe it.
Aha.
Come out, Dixie.
I know where you are.
Well, satisfied?
- Well, I don't understand it.
- Neither do I.
Maybe she isn't here.
Doesn't explain what you're doing here.
Oh, Eddie, don't be embarrassing.
What difference does that make?
All right, all right, I'm going.
But I'm not convinced.
Sorry.
Well...
I guess you both must think
I'm kind of daffy.
- You want the truth?
- What?
- You are.
- Who's daffy?
- You are. About Dixie.
- Eh.
Oh, darling.
Well, what happened to you?
Well, you won't think
I'm silly, will you?
- Why should I think you're silly?
- Well, it's about Dixie.
Eddie's so jealous that
I'm beginning to wonder too.
There's nothing between you, is there?
Oh, it'd break my heart if there was.
Tell me there isn't.
Well, opportunity, knock once more.
Quit it. You have no right.
You're taking advantage.
- This time we don't get away.
- Quit it.
- You have no right.
- I've waited for this.
- You're taking advantage.
- But, darling, I love you.
- Help! Dixie!
- I love you, I love you, I...
...love you.
MARILYN: Help, Dixie, help. Help!
Dixie, help.
- Let me up.
- Buddy. Stop it, you wolf, you.
I thought so.
I knew there was some...
What an act. What an act.
Oh, you opportunist, you.
A frame-up, huh?
Why didn't you come out in the open?
I didn't wanna get shot by a mad musician.
- How about that diamond ring?
- I haven't accepted it yet.
- Who gave it to you?
- I gave it to her.
How do you like that? Give one gal a ring then take advantage of her friend.
- How could you fall for such a jerk?
- Remember your temper.
- You've got a gun in that pocket.
- No, I haven't. I couldn't find one.
They're pearls, see? They were for you.
I'm gonna give them back to the oysters.
You pulled the wool over my eyes once too often.
Do something, or I'll never speak to you again.
Ow! Look here, it may interest you to know...
Nothing you could say could interest me.
- That's what I thought.
- Eddie.
Wait a minute.
Marilyn, will you and Buddy go out and have dinner someplace?
I wanna settle a few things with Eddie.
We're on our way, Dixie.
We'll be over at Twenty-one.
Eddie, come here.
Now, sit down.
- Eddie, l...
- I suppose...
...you wanna talk about our working together again.
Dixie, darling,
I don't think I could take it.
You see, I...
I'd keep watching you.
The funny little way you turn your head...
...and the way you pull on your ear when you haven't got an idea.
Oh, I couldn't take it, kid. I'm sorry.
Oh, Eddie, what's the matter with you, anyway?
Do you have to be hit in the head with a hammer?
Huh?
Oh, darling, how could you ever think
I could love anybody else?
The ring was a mistake, that's all.
A misunderstanding.
- Yeah?
- Oh, Eddie...
...I couldn't think of marrying him.
Well, then you're not sore at me?
I'm furious with you.
Oh, Dixie.
I guess you still love me, huh?
Oh, who else?
Marry me tonight.
- Oh, I shouldn't.
- I dare you.
- I shouldn't.
- I dare you.
Do you, Dixie Donegan, take this man for your lawful wedded husband?
Answer, "I do."
I do.
And do you, Edward Crane, take this woman for your lawful wedded wife?
Yeah, I do.
Well, I certainly am Joe the Jerk.
I risk my life to carry out your plans, the two characters get married...
...and what do I get?
You're too impulsive, Buddy.
And anyway, I'm a little worried about your intentions.
- What do you mean? I did all right.
- That's just it.
You were either loving that scene with Dixie or you're the greatest faker.
Oh, darling, that's what I love about you.
You're so doggone consistent.
Why consistent?
You get me to make a play for your best friend against my best friend...
...and then you rule me out for holding.
But I love you, you're wonderful.
Well, you know,
I have some emotions of my own.
Even I could have been a bit jealous.
You are?
I guess I kind of fell for my own formula.
Why didn't you tell me when we were with the guy with the Book?
- You didn't ask me.
- I didn't ask you.
And besides, you didn't have sense to bring a license.
I didn't have sense enough...
Did you say license?
You big chump.
What are you thinking, Dixie?
I was just thinking about the Hopkins show.
- Think what a chance that is for us.
- Yeah. Swell, isn't it?
Oh, it's more than swell, darling.
It's our wish fulfillment.
The one big chance we've waited for.
It's as if everything else of ours was just building toward that.
Yeah, I know.
When do we start work on it, darling?
Oh, I don't know.
Soon as we get back, I guess.
I'm afraid I'll be too tired.
Couldn't you wait till tomorrow?
Tomorrow?
No, I mean, when we get back from our honeymoon.
Honeymoon?
- Are you clowning?
- Certainly not.
I worked hard to win you back, now can't we just play a while?
Oh, but Eddie, the show is so important.
I thought you felt that too.
Oh, it'll wait. We can knock that off in a couple of weeks when we get back.
I was gonna surprise you. The Martins are loaning us their place in Bermuda.
It's across the bay from Kiki Wendover.
She's asking the mob down for a month.
Think of the fun when I tell them we're married.
They'll love you, Dixie.
What's the matter?
- Eddie.
- Yeah?
- I've just decided something.
- What?
We've got to go on working just the way we were.
- What do you mean?
- This show has got to be our best effort.
- When it's a hit, we can go away and play.
- I don't see it that way.
- It's got to be that way. What's...
- What are you driving at?
- We're married, aren't we?
- Yes, finally.
But until we finish the Hopkins show,
I'm gonna keep right on living with Marilyn.
[TIRES SCREECH]
- What happened?
- Do you mean that?
- I do.
- You mean I gotta go on living alone?
- Until we...
- Well, I'm not.
And if you think I am, you can get out of this car right here.
All right, Mr. Crane.
All out, kids. This is as far as we go.
- What's this all about?
- Don't ask me.
Go ahead, drive away if you dare.
And did he?
Yes.
- Well, how'd you get back to New York?
- Well, we:
I've always wanted to do that.
Well, proceed, Mrs. Crane.
The next day, when I got back,
Mr. Hopkins, the producer of the show...
...Eddie and I were supposed to write, told me Eddie had quit.
Well, during this time, did the defendant make any effort to see you?
None whatsoever.
- But...
- But what, Mrs. Crane?
I did see him once, two weeks after we were married.
What was he doing?
Composing a symphony.
How did you find out all about this?
While the show was in rehearsal, we needed a verse...
...for the big finale number in a hurry, and I was stuck.
I didn't seem to get ideas the way
I used to.
I remembered a half-finished lyric
I'd left in our apartment...
...when Eddie and I were working together, so I went up to get it.
[PIANO PLAYING]
[BUZZES]
- Dixie.
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello.
- I hate to disturb you...
...but I'll have to look for something I left here.
May I?
Why, sure. Sure, come on in.
Oh, uh...
Dixie, you remember Mrs. Wardley.
This is my... Uh...
- Miss Donegan.
- Yes, we've met.
Of course. How do you do?
Hello.
I didn't mean to make a dramatic entrance.
I've just come to get a piece of paper
I left here a couple of hundred years ago...
...when I was working here.
That's quite all right.
Eddie's told me all about you.
Oh?
He has?
Well, Mrs. Wardley is terribly interested in music.
Good music, that is.
So when I told her about the symphony
I'd always wanted to write...
...why, naturally...
- The what?
Well, I guess I never mentioned it to you.
- But I always felt that...
WARDLEY: You see, Mrs. Crane...
...Eddie's never had a fair chance to express himself.
Of course, he wrote some simply divine little tunes, but...
With lyrics.
Yeah, with lyrics.
My wife wrote the lyrics.
Forgive me.
Of course, he did mention that.
The point is, he wants to write something better.
That was just a step in his career.
- How was it you explained it to me?
- What?
About what you wanted to do, you remember?
Oh.
Well, I just told Mrs. Wardley that I was fed up writing popular songs.
Little jingles set to tunes.
Real music speaks a language more eloquent than words.
Give me flutes, oboes, a string section.
- Carnegie Hall.
- And Carnegie Hall. I'll show them.
- Why, you're serious.
- Miss Donegan, you...
You keep out of this.
So you're gonna walk out on the show.
You're gonna let me down.
I thought we kissed that nonsense goodbye two weeks ago in Connecticut.
You might have had the common decency to let me know.
- Did I hear you say "common decency"?
- Symphony, eh?
I thought I'd heard everything.
- But, Miss Donegan...
- You keep quiet and sit down.
I came to get a lyric and I'm not leaving without it.
- Get up.
- Leave her alone.
I wouldn't think of touching a hair of that divine coiffure.
But my lyric is in this piano seat.
Words, get it? Words.
Yeah, well, the words I've got
I can't use in front of a lady.
Oh, and you will let me hear your symphony, won't you?
When you hear it, it'll be at Carnegie Hall, and it'll cost you $3.30.
When you hear this it'll be at the Melody Box Theatre...
...and it'll cost you $5.50.
[ORCHESTRA PLAYING]
WOMAN [SINGING]: You can get it
From the blare of a trumpet
You can get it from the wail
Of a slide trombone
You can get it from the slap
Of a big string bass
Or the moan of a saxophone
And every time I hear a band
Start playing
Whether it be fast or sweet and low
From the very moment it starts beating
Everything about me starts repeating
Drums roll
Saxes moan
Trumpets blare
Fascinatin' rhythm
You got me on the go
Fascinatin' rhythm
I'm all a quiver
What a mess you're makin'
The neighbors wanna know
Why I'm always shakin'just like a flivver
Each morning I get up with the sun
Start a-hoppin', never stoppin'
To find at night no work has been done
I know that once it didn't matter
But now you're doin' wrong
When you start to patter
I'm so unhappy
Won't you take a day off?
Decide to go away
Somewhere far away off
And make it snappy
Oh, how I long to be the girl
I used to be
Fascinatin' rhythm
Oh, won't you stop pickin' on me?
Da-da-di-ah
Da-da-di-ah
Da-da-di-ah
Dah
Da-da-di-ah
Da-da-di-ah
Da-da-di-ah
Dah
Oh, how I wish they'd take it away
Take it away from me
That rhythm hangs around me all
Da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da
Da-da-di-ah-dah
Da-da-di-ah-dah
Da-da-da-di-ah-dah
Da-da-da-di-ah-dah
I know that rhythm is cruel to me
Rhythm is ruinin' me
Makin' a fool of me
Stop it
Stop it
Fascinatin' rhythm
Won't you stop pickin' on me
CHORUS [SINGING]: Fascinatin' rhythm
You got me on the go
Fascinatin' rhythm
I'm all a quiver
What a mess you're makin'
The neighbors should go
I'm always shakin' like a flivver
Each morn as I'm wakin' up
Very happy
Just to find that no work has been done
Once it didn't matter
But now you do wrong
- When you start to patter
- I'm so unhappy
Won't you take a day off?
A couple of weeks
Somewhere far away off
And make it snappy
Oh, how I long to be the man
That I used to be
Fascinatin' rhythm
Won't you stop pickin' on me?
Yes, I liked that number very much.
Oh, thank you.
- I didn't know you'd seen the show.
- Oh, yes. I was there the opening night.
And that was an amazing dance, young lady.
Take a bow.
Thank you, sir.
Proceed with the case, Mr. Blanton.
Your Honor...
...it seems fairly obvious in the absence of counsel for the defendant...
...and no evidence in any form to refute the charge of intolerable cruelty...
...that my client's case is defined.
We rest, Your Honor.
- Is Mr. Edward Crane in court?
- No, Your Honor.
Do you know Mr. Crane's whereabouts?
Well, the last thing I heard, he was taking a boat to South America.
A vacation, judge.
Mrs. Crane, it is within my jurisdiction to grant this divorce.
The last divorce awarded you by me...
...was granted on the grounds of incompatibility, is that right?
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Yes.
Well, now, this time, you say it's intolerable cruelty.
Let's see.
"Defendant failed to fulfill his marital obligations.
Lived apart from the plaintiff for a period of more than six months."
I take it, then, that you've ceased to love one another.
- I didn't say that.
- But you still want a divorce.
- Yes.
- Yes.
Well, you're not going to get it.
- But, Your Honor, I object.
- Objection overruled.
Young lady...
...when I was a boy there was a strange custom in this country...
...that when a fellow and a girl fell in love, they got married and stayed that way.
And fought to make a go of it.
Now, I gave you that first divorce...
...because I knew one of two things was going to happen:
If you didn't love each other sincerely...
...why, the divorce would stand, and if you did, you'd get married again.
Now, once married you're not going to get another divorce out of this court.
Not while I've the strength to lift a gavel.
So go home and behave yourself.
Case dismissed.
I beg your pardon, sir. Judge.
I thought you'd turn up.
You can't do this to me.
I have a right to be represented.
I love my wife.
- Oh, this must be Mr. Crane.
- Yes, sir.
What are all these things
I can't do to you?
You can't divorce us.
I have something to say.
I demand as a citizen the right to trial and free speech.
I love Mrs. Crane and no man can put us asunder.
"Until death do us part."
Well, now, suppose you're too late?
You mean she's been here?
But you can't do that, judge.
I'm sure that isn't legal.
Look, young fellow, contrary to your conception...
...this is a court of law, and not a matrimonial pinball game.
I'm not here to establish a record for marital hits and home runs.
But I'm here to mete out justice to the best of my ability...
...from the evidence presented.
Your wife and her attorney were here...
...and they gave their testimony as to your negligence.
- But, Your Honor...
- Your negligence and indifference...
...as a husband.
Why, they even indicated that you were writing a symphony.
Oh, that. That was months ago.
I didn't even finish it.
- Good.
- I beg your pardon?
Oh, nothing, nothing.
At the conclusion of their testimony,
I was obliged to render a decision.
The only decision I could that would be right under the circumstances.
But there's only one circumstance,
I love her.
Well, I'm very sorry, but the case is entirely out of my hands.
Step on it. Drive like a maniac.
I've gotta catch her.
Catch her? You just left her.
- No, I was too late.
- Oh.
Say, won't this thing go any faster?
What do you mean? We're going 92 now.
Oh, that's 29.
Hey, there's Buddy's car. Stop.
Back up. Hurry up.
What do you want me to do, go in sideways?
I don't care.
- Marilyn?
- Why, Eddie Cranes.
- Where have you been?
- Where did you come from?
- South America.
- Leave your boat outside?
- Where's Dixie?
- On the terrace.
- She wanted to be alone for a minute.
- Well, she isn't gonna be.
Dixie.
- Eddie.
- Oh, darling.
Edward Crane.
What do you mean rushing in and scaring me half to death?
Do you realize I haven't seen you for six months?
Oh, I've been wrong, darling,
I know it.
But I'm cured now.
You gotta take me back.
Well, isn't this kind of sudden?
Don't you think you might do a little explaining?
Well, I went away alone.
This time I had to be sure.
I am now, honest.
People, songs, even pianos don't mean a thing anymore, honey.
From now on, it's only you.
- Oh, Eddie, are you sure? It's been so...
- I'm positive.
I want you to marry me again.
Well, haven't you heard?
Hasn't anyone told you?
Yes, but that's a lot of nonsense, darling.
You still love me, don't you?
Oh, Eddie, I love you very much.
But I won't ever marry you again.
Darling, I can't stand it any longer.
I'm going crazy living alone.
You won't have to anymore.
Hey, wait a minute. We're not married.
- Eddie?
- Hm?
- Will you do me a favor?
- Mm-hm.
Will you keep right on thinking we're not?
Oh, boy, that's a cue for a song if I ever saw one.
[SINGING] Oh, sweet and lovely
Lady, be good
[SINGING]
Oh, baby, be good to me
[SINGING]
I am so awfully misunderstood
[SINGING]
Oh, baby, be good to me
[SINGING]
Oh, please have some pity
[SINGING]
I'm all alone in this big city
I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood
So, lady, be good to me
[ENGLISH SDH]
- You can't go in here.
- I have to see the Mayor.
He's in a council meeting, he can't be disturbed.
I demand that you let me through, I've ridden all night, 80 miles.
- That's orders.
- Get out of my way.
Stay out, stop, I said stop.
I must see the Mayor.
But the Mayor is attending a council meetings.
Let go of me, you'll be sorry, I'm a relative of the Mayor.
So am I, so the whole council.
- Where's the council room?
- I won't talk.
Cousin Bryo, cousin Bryo.
Stop making so much noise, they're in a meeting.
- Be quiet.
- What is this commotion?
- Cousin Gregor.
- Cousin Bryo.
- It's my cousin, the Mayor of Trebin.
- I'm sorry uncle, he's mad, he tries to...
Terrible had happened.
- Come in here.
- Cousin Gregor.
I've been riding all night, it's a disaster, I'm ruined.
Come and sit down, fetch brandy and water.
- No water.
- No water.
Now, what is it? What is it?
Come on, speak out, what happened?
Like thunder he appeared among us, the postmaster was hanged... the chief of police was let off with 200 lashes.
I, I was sentenced to the firing squad.
Luckily my own first made set of rifles, they blew up and I escaped.
- I need a fresh horse I must be off at once.
- A fresh horse for our cousin.
- Sit down, sit down.
- But I must go.
- Even now, he may be here in your midst.
- Who?
- Speak up man, who?
- The Inspector General.
Yes, he has full power from the Emperor himself.
And wherever he finds bribery and corruption... that's where the gallows and firing squads go to work. More.
What does he look like, this Inspector General?
Who knows? A man of mystery.
Five days he was in our midst and no one even suspected it.
He went everywhere, saw everything... and uncovered such corruption that even I was shocked.
Now don't get excited.
Don't get excited? How I envy you, so secure in your clean town and fear no one.
- The horse is ready Uncle Byro.
- I must be off.
Poor Gregor, where will you go?
Away, far away, anywhere, Africa, China.
Goodbye cousin Byro.
Farewell Uncle.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye cousin.
- You need any money?
- You bet I need it uncle Gyro.
I have a few crowns.
Thank you.
Farewell.
I would like to take this opportunity to tend to my resignation...
- effective...
- Sit down.
What would you do?
Go back to rolling pills in that stinky hole of chemist shop, you poisoner.
- I promised my wife...
- I have to talk to my sister...
Stay where you are, nothing is to be gained by rushing around blindly.
We must proceed according to system. You Lazlo, clean up the square.
Leave all the public buildings spotless, the patients in all the hospital beds.
You Toleki, get the children back into school.
- Start teaching them something, anything.
- Yes, brother in law.
You two deliver the mail, all of it, whether you've read it or not.
- I, I never read the mail.
- Yes you did, don't you remember?
Quiet.
Kovak, come back here.
I want all roads policed day and night.
I want a report of everyone who's entered this town in the past 24 hours.
Check the tavern, investigate all strangers.
Bring your reports to me personally, you understand?
Yes, but first I would like to...
First you will obey the orders, now get out of here.
Thank you cousin Bryo.
Order double guards at the city gates and patrol all roads to Brodny at once.
- Uncle what happened...
- At once.
- Come with me.
- Hey, what goes with Uncle General?
Shut up, I say come with me.
- Anything wrong.
- Quiet.
Quiet you.
I shall investigate here, you men go on to the next town.
Countrymen approach, step up, step up.
Come close to meet one of the greatest experience of your life.
You will tell your children and grandchildren about this.
Then first you will be entertained... by the greatest musicians in the country, direct from the court of the Emperor.
- Yakov's elixir, the best that can be had.
- Yeah.
- Yakov's elixir is good for what is bad.
- Yeah.

Try this elixir is best for what it's worth.
Now good people, step closer my rub, come back to me, see all with your own eye.

- Who him?
Captain, don't run away, come back, come back.
We'll received welcome any investigation.
Look my friends, it lives, it breathes.
It laughs, it cries, it thinks.
Watch his left ear, how much is 2 and 2?
Correct, this is not just an old head.
This is Prince Ahmed of ancient Egypt.
Beheaded by the cruel Pharaoh... because of his forbidden love for the crown Princess.
And now my friends you ask yourselves... how is this miracle survived for over 2000 years?
An excellent question, only this...
Yakov's Golden Elixir.
Look how his eyes plead with me to give him a dose of my elixir.
He fairly yearns for its richness, goodness, here you go friend.
I'm a simple man my friends, I do not make extravagant claims for my medicine.
If a person is already dead, for instance... there is only a slim chance that my medicine will do him any good.
But if only a spark of life remains...
Yakov's Golden Elixir will fan it into a roaring fire of health.
How can Yakov cheat those poor people like that?
Why? What's the matter?
Well, this is the furniture polish he sold yesterday.
- Come on, hurry up, he's almost through.
- Alright, here we go.
No, you don't wear this.
Here is the testimonials from my grateful customers.
Yet, even from the great Napoleon himself, written on the battlefield of Austerlitz.
He gives the elixir full credit for the victory.
For years I've suffered terrible digestive distress.
However since taking
Yakov's miracle elixir...
I no longer find it necessary to continuously hold my hand on my stomach.
Kindest personal regards, Napoleon.

Innocent? You'll hang with a clear conscience.

The hospital, have you cleaned it up?
Cleaned up the floor and put sheets on the beds and we got the goats out of surgery.
And I put charts on the foot of each of the patients... beds indicating the nature of their illness.
Good, now at least now they'll know what they die from. Kovach.
Well, I've patrolled all the roads leading to and from Brodny.
So unless the Inspector General disguises himself like a bird and fly into the city...
- he'll never get past me.
- Good and the jail?
Well, I've had new locks fitted to all the cells, burned all the rubbish.
- I even have a prisoner.
- Good, who is he?
Oh I don't know, just a tramp.
I apprehended him in the city square.
He was trying to make off with a horse and wagon, the one we were loading with silver.
- My silver? My valuables?
- Yes, but I got him before he...
Who is he? Where did he come from?
Oh I don't know,
I, I just assigned before he...
Just a common tramp, dressed in rags.
You idiot, did you cite him, question him?
But it was so near lunch time and he was, he was just a common tramp.
The Inspector General? Oh, that's ridiculous.
Why not a tramp? In Falsburg he first appeared as a traveling shoe salesman.
In Clamatti he was disguised as a peddler and here, why not a tramp?
My horse and wagon, the wagon I loaded with valuables to ship out of town.
Of course, the evidence he needed, now he knows.
I would like to take this opportunity to tender my resignation.
My tail office, my god.
Who's there?
- Want some water?
- Water? I want some food.
Sorry, the prisoners are fed promptly at 3 o'clock.
Alright, guess I can hold out til then.
- Wednesday and Saturday.
- Thursday, but today is Thursday.
- To this time?
- But I haven't eaten in two days.
What kind of jail is this where they won't even give a man a crust of bread.
All I want is a little piece of food there.
This is a nice jail, really it is.
- We've had some nice hangings here.
- Oh, that's very nice.
- What's worth about that hanging?
- Oh, you should see the ceremony.
- And the last meal.
- The last meal?
- Can you, can you order anything you like?
- Anything.
The town of Brodny may have its faults, but they...
- certainly do it right when they hang a man.
- They do?
The Mayor and all the commissionaires come dressed in their finest clothes.
And the town band assembles at the door of the jail.
Such beautiful music and they play the prisoner right up to the gallows.
I'll never forget one hanging we had a few years ago.
- What's that?
- What's what?
- What's that music?
- It might...
What were you arrested for?
Well nothing, I'm innocent, the horse followed me and all I...
The commissionaires and everybody and they brought the band.
Who, who they going to hang?
There's only one prisoner here, if he doesn't finish his last meal, he...
Help, help, help, help, help...
You let me out of this jail, do you hear?
Or I'll go right to the Emperor.
Help, help, what a fine crooked village this much be, thieves you must've here.
Help, let me out, help, help, help.
- Thieves you must've here.
- A common tramp, eh?
Why was I put in this jail? Help.
- Open the gate.
- No trial, no justice.
I, I will report this to the Emperor.
I, I, this is a crooked village, this is.
I, I, don't anybody come near me.
Don't you come near me, if any of you come near me. I demand to be released.
Sire please, if you have been put to any, any inconvenience...
I assure you that my colleagues and myself are extremely distressed.
This is just a small community, not rich or powerful but...
But citizens or travelers... be they humbled or exhorted to the highest degree of nobility... be they vagrants or inspector generals appointed by the Emperor... in our village they find courtesy... honor and strict adherence to the principals of justice.
Command us you Excellency and we will obey.
Believe me your Highness, I understand and value your desire to remain incognito.
Permit me to compliment you on your amazing disguise.
It is most convincing.
In a corrupt city, with dishonest officials, a such a strategy would be most effective.
But here, in our fair village of Brodny, we beg you to accept our hospitality.
Why don't we discuss he entire situation at dinner.
Go to my house, tell my wife we have an honor guest,
Tell her I want a feast, a banquet.
Your Excellency, how can we talk in these sordid surroundings?
At my home dinner will be just about ready.
A roast, a turkey, several kinds of game, a rack of lamb, a magnificent pot roast.
And you will probably want a change of clothes.
Now quick, some suitable clothing for His Excellency.
- Where will I get the clothing?
- Your uniform, take it off.
- Now?
- Now.
- Your Excellency.
- Yes mister yes.
Our chief of police regrets his mistake.
He will be delighted to have you wear his uniform until your luggage arrives.
Call that to be honored.
But he's tall, hes young he is, is he going to stay long?
I hope not.
- What's taking you so long, hurry.
- But I can't get it, it is too tight.
Too tight it be, I wonder if the
Inspector General will think it's too tight?
Tell me did you notice the color of his eyes? Are they blue? Are they brown?
Are they black eyes?
What are you staring at stupid?
Get busy and set the table.
And you two, when you serve, see that your hands are clean.
And you Bela, you remove the dishes when I ring.
And you Lateues, you bring on the fresh course and move quickly and... see that you don't spill anything on our guests.
- Did you hear me? What did I say?
- I take a bowl of fruits.
- When?
- When you ring the bell.
Oh Lisa... you have serve the wine and do anything else to make yourself useful, come Burbus.
Put on a clean apron. Did he say anything about Paris? Or Budapest or Vienna?
That dress was too tight.
So tight, it made her eyes pop out.
This is my humble home Your Excellency.
It isn't large but I've only a small pittance of a salary.
Maria, my jewel. Maria.
You're Excellency, that is is my wife Maria.
His Excellency, the Inspector General.
A privilege Your Excellency, may us be getting pleasure for it.
Let me have you hat and sword.
Your Excellency, this is my wife Catherine.
Cousin Laslo... we must get rid of him, I'll give him plenty of brandy, anything to stop the inspection.
You get the glasses.
A toast Your Excellency.
Something to prepare your palate.
A toast for His Excellency.
- I'll see about the dinner.
- Dinner?
- Your Excellency, this way.
- Right this way.
- A toast to His Excellency.
- Long live His Excellency.
Laslo, get the wine, the brandy, quickly.
- Come on, quickly.
- More brandy Bela.
Now Your Excellency, how charming it is for us to have...
May I present Mrs. Burbus Your Excellency.
She's the wife of our tax collector and chemist.
Here we are. Your Excellency, a little more wine and a toast to His Majesty, The Emperor.
Long live The Emperor.
This is Izzy and his twin brother Gizzy.
They're in charge of our postal department.
- The Inspector General, Izzy.
- I'm not Izzy, he is.
It's very easy to tell by the strawberry mark.
No, no, no, some other time.
One more aperitif just before dinner.
Dinner is served.
Ah, dinner is serve, one last drink Your Excellency.
- A toast, here's to the righteous.
- To the righteous.
Here's to the evil doer.
I suppose after Paris and Budapest, your returning here must be very distasteful?
What do you think of Switzerland?
I have relatives there, the Berghoffs.
Did you ever run across them?
Your uniform is just beautiful, my husband has one just like it.
I hope you're not disappointed in the simple fair we serve here.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I, I would like to propose a toast.
To the fairest city in all the land.
To the home of courage, integrity and honesty, to Brodny.
Of course, even if I'd had time to prepare the proper kind of dinner...
I don't suppose Your Excellency would've found it comparable... to the table they're able at the Emperor's Palace.
Of course, I do wish Gregor had given me a little more time, you know...
Maria, His Excellency's glass is empty.
Lisa more wine. Quickly, quickly.
After you've eaten, perhaps you'll tell me about your life in Vienna?
Yes.
- OH, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean.
- That's all right, is just an accident.
Why you clumsy Drudge.
Oh, it was nothing, just merely an accident,
I always spill wine all over my suit.
She didn't mean it, was just an accident.
Water is very good for wool.
Just that she didn't mean it, it was just an accident, nothing.
She really didn't...
Latus, bring on the meat course to His Excellency, Bela, the meat courses.
Bring on the meat courses to His Excellency, quickly.
Pard me.
Tell me, is it true about the women in Paris that I've heard of?
Lady, may you pass this down.
- Is something wrong Your Excellency?
- Oh, try theses Your Excellency.
I always carry with me, it'll cure anything.
Good morning Your Excellency, I thought you'd like a glass of milk before breakfast.
But how, how did I get here?
We carried you up after dinner Your Excellency.
- We undressed you.
- We?
And you were in a very playful mood Your Excellency.
- Oh, what a naughty Inspector General.
- What.?
Maria, all right, all right.
Good morning Your Excellency.
May I express the hope that you spent a comfortable night.
Eh, what, what time is it?
It's just past nine.
But you've ample time for a substantial breakfast before you start...
- your tour of inspection sir.
- Inspection?
Yes, our program is 11 AM reception... at the Town Hall, inspection of the Guard of Honor and a band concert.
At 11:30 a parade to the jail, at 12:15 a public hanging.
- Hanging?
- Followed by lunch.
This, this hanging?
Isn't anyone I know, is it?
Oh, it's just some rascal our ready police arrested him, was impersonating a police office.
Impersonating a...?
Yes, he made off with a sack of apples from the local fruit merchant.
Yes, impersonating an officer, his hanging is much to quicker here.
Of course, now I realize your Excellency wants... to continue his journey as soon as possible.
Yes I, I must, I must go immediately, no receptions, no...
Why, Your Excellency I'm broken hearted...
I was looking forward to you inspecting our little village.
Yes, there is, a wonderful village, finest village I've ever seen, but I...
Be kind enough to say so in your official report?
- Yes, yes of course, but I must get dressed.
- Yes, yes of course.
Assemble the villagers and band to speed His Excellency on his way.
- Where are my clothes?
- Clothes? Kovach, the uniform.
Well it's badly stained, I was having it cleaned.
Now, having a fresh uniform for His Excellency.
Yes, but where will I get one for His Excellency?
Oh, yours will do.
Oh, this is brand new, this wouldn't fit His Excellency.
Izzy, Gizzy, take care of this.
They're both tailors Your
Excellency, they'll rectify that.
A new uniform for
His Excellency in a half an hour.
Even in the short time you've been here, you've captured the hearts of our people.
What a pity you have to leave.
Oh, well I thought I might be coming back again soon.
No, no, no, don't change your plans on our account. Quick His Excellency's horse.
Hey, the Inspector General's horse.
Thank you, I'll send the horse back
- as soon as I...
- No, keep it, keep it.
Misha, help His Excellency to mount.
Oh Your Excellency...
Oh Your Excellency, great star of wisdom.
Yakov?
Exhorted one, do not be angry with your devoted servant...
I've hunted for you everywhere.
Oh, forgive me great master.
Forgive me, show mercy on your unworthy servant.
Forgive me you numbskull or I'll break you in half.
- Oh, be generous master.
- It's all right Yakov.
I am the lowly servant of
His Great Lord, the Inspector General.
Due to my negligence we were separated on the road.
- Oh, I was just leaving.
- Oh, I must speak to you first master.
The Emperor has sent you confidential instructions, a secret message.
- Secret message?
- But he was just leaving.
The Inspector General will decide that for himself.
What you doing? Yakov, I'll never be able to get out, there lot of...
Yakov why did you stop me? I had a chance...
- to get away and now they may hang me.
- Be quiet you idiot.
Why should they hang the Inspector General.
They lay the whole town at your feet.
I don't want the town,
I got everything I want, I just...
- want to get out of here.
- You've got everything you want?
- What have you got?
- I didn't let anything...
- slip through my fingers.
- What have you got? See.
Didn't scratch, steal and take, doggy dog, see?
Fool, three spoons and these fat thieves are loaded with gold.
Yakov, but you don't understand... we can sell the spoons, buy a new wagon and leave this town.
Alright, go on, run away.
I was right in the first place, you haven't got an honest bone in your body.
Honest bone?
Wait a minute Yakov, I don't understand... only a few days ago you kicked me out because you said I wasn't a good thief.
- I kicked you out?
- Yes.
I put out my heart because you're bit... for crying a relieving company and this is all the thanks I get?
For once in your miserable life you have a chance really to do some good.
The act doesn't cost and what happens?
You want to run like a rabbit.
To save your old savage skin, never a thought to the people in the village.
- Nothing but selfishness.
- Now, wait a minute.
Oh, I crawled through every corner of the village.
Georgi, what misery exists here.
The Mayor and his officials taxed the very life out of this town.
And not content with that, they steal.
35,000 crowns they collected from the little children and their poor parents... to buy a pipe organ from the church.
And they trump up a cock and bull story that the organ was destroyed...
But I know that they sold it another town.
By tonight we can make them pay
35,000 crowns for protection.
Then I buy back the organ, you present it to the town and we expose these rascals.
May I become a wandering gypsy if I'm not telling the truth.
- But you are a wandering gypsy.
- That proves I'm telling the truth.
Now to work Georgi, the most important thing that you make... them understand that you know how crooked they are, they'll shower you with gold.
35,000 crowns Yakov, you think they'll give it to me just like that?
They will give you more, never fails.
They given easier when you're an Inspector General.
Yeah, but I don't know how to be an Inspector General.
That's very simple, you have to behave like one.
- But how?
- Oh, how? Why? What?
Don't bother me with silly technicalities, you're the Inspector General.
Be big, strong, firm.
Gentlemen, I've good news for you.
The Inspector General has decided to remain indefinitely.
He demands an inspection of the financial affairs of Brodny... and he will meet with you at the town hall at 2 o'clock.

To the Town Hall.
Find everything is in order.
Just a moment. What was that? What was what?
- What?
- I thought I saw something.
How do you account for this?
- Well...
- Well? Yes?
There were no taxes that day Excellency.
If you put your official signature to the books.
What is this?
Oh, it's the very best we have Your
Excellency, we're not a very rich community.
I, I, I, I think I'd better not sign this until I've...
You finish examining the books more closely at the house Your Excellency.
Yes and excellency idea.
We shall see, what we shall see.
And all I saw was this medicine show.
The fat gypsy was selling the stuff and his partner... had his head on a plate.
- Who is that man?
- That His Excellency, the Inspector General.
Dear Yakov.
I can not... stay any longer.
Love, Georgi.
This is the kitchen isn't it?
Well, you go right ahead, I'm just inspecting.
Fine, just fine.
- Now tell me, is there another way out?
- Out?
- O U F, out.
- Oh you're not leaving Your Excellency.
Oh, I have to, I can't stay another minute.
There's another town I have to inspect, now, right now.
- People are waiting I, how do I get out.
- I can't believe it.
You can't believe what? You can't believe I have another town to inspect?
Of course I do Your Highness.
- Please don't be angry with me.
- Oh, I wasn't angry, I...
You were so kind last night, I thought you would stay.
And it gave me new hope.
Oh, the whole village is looking to you for help.
Yes, well I thought perhaps on my way back, I...
- Your Excellency such plundering and misery.
- It's terrible but... you should see this other town it's, they need me very badly.
- People are waiting and receptions.
- I see.
I, I really mustn't disappoint them, I...
Well, I'd better be going.
- I'm sorry you won't be more friendly.
- Friendly? Why should I be friendly?
I don't care if I hang for I must say what
I think, you're as bad as the rest of them.
Worse, because you have the power to do good and you run away.
I'll stay, I can get the organ back.
Lt didn't burn, I know where it is.
- Oh then, you do care about the people.
- Of course I do.
- Oh, the whole town be so happy.
- I want you to be happy Lizzy.
Oh, I don't count Your Excellency, I'm just a kitchen maid and I'll always be one.
But that's no way to look at life, things can change over night.
After all I wasn't born an Inspector General.

Latus, Bela, see to the carriage.
- Where is everybody? Oh Your Excellency.
- Madame...
Just look what I found in the Brodny library.
The new almanac of The Emperor's official staff.
Emperor's official staff?
With histories of their families and portraits by celebrated artists.
Oh, the portraits are very bad, they very bad, you wouldn't recognize the one of me.
Oh, it's so hard that...
Thought only women were vain about their portraits.
No.
Now I've got to see how bad they made you look.
Oh, you know you've never even told me your name.
- A name?
- Ah no, it doesn't matter.
I'll soon recognize you and find out... all about you and your beautiful wife and lovely children.
Oh, I have no wife, none of my family had wives, my father didn't like wives.
I mean my mother didn't like my father's wife.
- May I have this book?
- Oh, no.
This looks rather like you but older of course, is a relative of yours?
- Oh yes, is my father.
- Your father? Madame Knabe?
Married to Peter Knabe, age 46, mother of 12 boys.
Oh, That was a disguise, my father was a spy in the war and he... he always used to disguise himself as my mother.
- Your father?
- No, no, my mother.
- I was 19 before I could tell them apart.
- Knabe, is that your family name?
- Yes, Farple Knabe.
- Farple? Oh, what an unusual name.
Sounds like a morning breeze, rustling through the leaves of the willows.
What does it mean?
Some kind of soup, I think.
Where were you born?
Oh well, let me have the book and I'll tell you all about it. Yes.
Oh, some, some night when we're alone now, perhaps tonight.
Oh, I want to hear everything Farple.
You don't know how I yearn to live.
What it means to be married to a man who doesn't understand you.
- He's a peasant of course, uncultured pig.
- Really?
I was forced to marry him.
I'm an attractive woman, am I not?
Yes.
I'm still in the first bloom of my youth, am I not?
- Yes.
- I'm desirable, am I not?
Yes, but...
Could a man wish for a more lovely, intelligent, responsive woman than I am?
- No.
Oh Farple, you say the most beautiful things.
Well, I really must be going upstairs now.
- You'll help me Farple, won't you? Promise.
- Yes I, I promise.
When we get to Paris,
I won't be a burden for you.
- I swear.
- Yes.
Forgive me, may I have a word with Your Excellency?
What do you want?
I throw myself on your mercy. Please
Your Excellency, for the sake of my family.
Oh, what is it? What have you done?
The tax records, it wasn't my idea to falsify them, the Mayor, my own uncle and Toleki.
All did this burden for you.
I admit I take bribes but what kind of bribes?
- Puppy dogs, that's all, just puppy dogs.
- Puppy dogs?
- Yes. Oh, all kinds.
- All kind of puppy dogs?
- Oh, I like puppy dogs.
- Oh, you can have them Your Excellency.
Oh, forgive me. Yes, all 60 of them.
And here's, here's just a little gift just to show you how much I...
- Your Excellency?
- Who is it?
It is I Toleki, superintendent of the school, your honor.
He mustn't find me here.
Oh he's just a member of the council the city doesn't have.
Come in.
Your Excellency, may
I have a moment of your time.
I have something that may interest you, look.
Well, you see I have the best interest this thing or how do I ever tell you this.
- You understand that.
- It's alright, come to the point Tacky.
- Toleki.
- I tell Toleki you.
Sometimes a man must decide between duty and friends and...
I feel it is my duty to advise you of the rising corruption in the city of Brodny.
This isn't much, but if you just accept it as a loan, if you like it'll help...
May I see you a moment Your
Excellency, it is Gizzy, the postmaster.
Gizzy, he may not find me here.
Come in, come in.
I'm a poor man Your Excellency.
Please accept those, it's all I have.
The temptation was too strong, the others stole more than I did. I...
- You did?
- Who is that at the door?
Come with me, we got to hide.
Hey, in this closet here.
Can come in.
- Oh Inspector General.
- Yes.
Oh, let me see, I want speak to you,
I must speak to you.
Oh, my uniform looks, looks very nice on you.
Oh, I'm having one made in black, with silver across here.
What is it Kovach?
Oh, I guess I might've make a clean brake for it.
- Won't you sit down?
- Yes, thank you.
You see it wasn't for me, I did it for my wife, my wife is not a contented woman.
She wants clothing and money and jewels.
Oh, I love my family but I'd give my 6 kids to get rid of my wife.
- So, there's only 1,000 crowns in here.
- A 1,000 crowns?
If you just give me a chance to sell the jewels.
Won't you sit down?
In the bed.
Come in.
- Oh, Your Excellency...
- I just put you in here,
You Excellency...
Come in.
Oh, I didn't know you were resting Your Excellency.
Oh, I always rest, the doctor said it's good for my liver.
- Maybe I'd better come back?
- No, it's all right, what is it you want?
- I just wanted to make a confession.
- I'll take it.
- Well, better come...
- I'm as guilty as the rest of the others.
Oh, I mustn't be found here, where do I hide? On the bed.
Not the bed.
On top of the bed.
Come in.
- You don't have to put on any act for me.
- The message come from the Emperor?
What?
Go downstairs and see if my luggage has arrived.
- What's the matter with you?
- What's the weather outside like?
Look if this is a...
- There's a lot of people hiding in there.
- Hiding?
Oh, the councilmen that came with their bribes.
- Bribes? Money? Money.
- Money.
- Where is it?
- It's here.
Why? Come in.
Your Excellency, may
I speak with you for a moment?
- Yes, of course.
- Privately.
They all brought him money.
Gentlemen, have to ask you to leave the room.
- Oh Mayor and you too Mr. Chief of Police.
- Yes?
- His Highness can not tolerate dishonesty.
- No, then why did he...
- accept the bribes?
- A few misery crowns.
His Excellency has many private charities.
I can assure you not a penny of that money will ever find... its way into the pockets of the Inspector General.
Well, what do you want us to do?
It's possible, via of possibility mine, view that... a few substantial contributions from you might...
- How much?
- Shall we say 100,000 crowns?
- 100,000 crowns.
- I'll be a pauper.
Well then keep your money, you can jingle it in your pockets... all the way up the steps of the gallows.
- He wouldn't do anything like that.
- He would and he has.
But he might be inclined to show leniency if... he can realize the charitable dream of his life.
A much needed addition of the
Cathedral he built in Vienna.
A new church organ, a fire proof organ.
- Fire proof, he knows.
- He knows.
We can get rid of him without leaving a trace and none of us will be involved.
Who'll do it?
- Vetalo, the clodhopper.
- Vetalo, the clodhopper?
He'll do as I tell him, he has to.
I can get him tonight, during the reception when all is confusion and noise.
- But if something goes wrong.
- Nothing will go wrong.
- Are you sure?
- Yes sir.
After midnight, as soon as everybody has had plenty to drink... one of us will get him into the barn where Vetalo the clodhopper is waiting.
- He will dispose of the body.
- Good.
What are you doing?
Why, you think I want to steal it? I want to count it.
- Well, I already counted it.
- You can't count.
Well, it's very heavy so there must be enough here to buy back the organ.
- Right, give it to me I'll go get the organ.
- Oh no, not without me.
You know, you can't leave here, they need you for the reception.
Well then, we'll go after the reception.
Look Yakov, there's an old Hungarian proverb...
Trust everybody but keep the organ money in sight.
Come in.
- What is that?
- It's just a letter.
- What kind of letter?
- Well, a love letter I suppose.
- A love letter for you? Let me see that.
- No Yakov.
- Oh, let me see.
- No, it's private Yakov.
- Never mind, let me see.
- No.
Yakov you might tear it.
Well?
Would you read it for me Yakov?
- Oh Georgi, you're such a lucky guy.
- What is it?
A beautiful girl like that fall in love with you.
Read it to me Yakov please.
My dearest darling Inspector General.
From the moment I first saw you, I knew you were the one.
At night I dream of your manly figure... and your handsome gentle features drive me mad with passionate love.
The sound of your voice thrills me beyond words... and if I can not have you for my very own, I must surely die.
Is there any more?
Does she say anything else?
Yes, yes. PS please meet me in the barn at midnight.
Please meet me in the barn at mid...
Yakov, what is PS mean?
Ps? Please Sweetheart.
Please sweetheart meet me in the barn at midnight.
- I have the carriage waiting Farple.
- The carriage?
My things are all packed, I'll meet you at the stable after the dance.
Cousin Byro...
I have the money, has he sent in his report? Then I'll deliver to him tonight.
- We can't settle the matter in here.
- Where would you suggest?
- Outside, in the barn.
- At midnight?
- At midnight.
- He'll be there.
I'll go and get ready,
I'll see you later Farple.
I got your note, you're wonderful, at the barn?
Thank you.
Out of my way, I am Colonel Franz Castine.
Comrade, life long friend of His
Excellency, the Inspector General.
We were friends for many, many years, announce me at once young lady.
- Yes Colonel.
- Oh, young man.
Problem with the eyes, are there Colonel?
Yes, yes, I was snow blinded in the Alps in the...
Italian campaign with His Majesty, The Emperor.
The Emperor, long life to his Superior Majesty, The Emperor.
Now you idiot, you blithering idiot, now where are my glasses?
I'm so blind without my glasses, now be careful, be careful.
Now don't step on them.
- Oh, I am so sorry.
- You stupid fool.
- I'll have to go and get another pair.
- No, no now you just stay right there.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I've the honor... to announce the unexpected arrival of Colonel
Franz Castine, The Emperor's Royal Guard.
Comrade in arms and life long friend of
Your Excellency, the Inspector General.
The Colonel is quite near sighted and had the misfortune of breaking his glasses.
Imagine, he broke his glasses.
Oh no Colonel, you're kissing the wrong man, this is the Inspector General.
Oh of course, how stupid of me, the Inspector
General is really a much shorter man.
Leopold, this is indeed a joy, a joy.
I noticed that you shaved your mustache.
Oh, it used to tickle, drove me nut, me that...
It's all right, it's all right, it's makes you look much younger.
And your voice it's seems to sound more youthful.
Oh, I always had pharyngitis.
My friends, this is the man, who single handed... routed an entire regiment of the Italians at the battle of Lavengretto.
And then he pushed their own cannon into position and fired at the retreating enemy.
- You remember that my boy?
- Nothing.
- And Austerlitz?
- I'm dried, couldn't came up.
Oh, he didn't do much, he just dove into a raging river and rescued 4 wounded soldiers.
And then on the way, he cut down
10 Spaniards with his, with his Sabre.
The morale was very low but with his magnificent courage... he plunged into the fray and led his men with a song.
The victory song of the 94th regiment.
♪ Onward, onward, never looking back. ♪
How does it go Leopold?
He doesn't like to be reminded of that tragic day.
But he might be persuaded to sing something lighter, more gay.
In a little while.
Oh splendid, splendid, then
I can get my glasses from the inn.
Oh no, no sir. Why don't you sing something now and honor the Colonel?
Sing you imbecile, before he gets his glasses.
Oh, could I borrow your drink for this song?
And now and now for my friend and comrade in arms I...
I'd like to do a gypsy, a gypsy drinking song.
- My wine, he took my wine.
- There's plenty more.
No, but when he swallow it, you see...
- Why are you trembling for?
- The wine is deadly poison.
Is it? You did it?
How very thoughtful of you.
Why, I misjudged you all these years.
- Oh, no, no, it was for me.
- For you?
Yes, I couldn't stand it any longer,
I even wrote a confession.
What? A confession?

Yes I, very much.
Lisa? Lisa?
Oh, why you clumsy ox, what's the matter with you? You crazy?
You know you could've killed me with that.
Why you have to work so late at night anyway?
Whatever you have to chop can wait til morning, can't it?
Now, now go on to bed, I got to meet somebody here. Go on to bed.
- Oh, aren't you the Inspector General?
- Yeah.
That doesn't mean I can't meet anybody here, does it?
No? You don't believe it do you?
- Read that.
- Don't go near the barn.
- They're going to kill you.
- Yeah and only two hours ago she...
Would you read, read that again please?
It says, don't go near the barn, they're going to kill you.
Yakov, Yakov, my best friend.
- Where's your master?
- My master?
- How did it?
- You know how.
Now gentlemen, let's get down to business.
For a price, I'll get rid of the evidence.
The money.
- I don't think I want any supper.
- Oh no.
- What you doing Yakov? Where you going?
- Get away from me, get out, get out.
Oh, your honor, you...
Georgi, I'm your best friend.
- Where we going?
- Get the organ.
- Make way for the Inspector General.
- Make way for the Inspector General.
- What did he say?
- Must've been an echo.
Attention, announcing the
Emissary of The Emperor.
General Leopold Nikolai Tarantino, His
Excellency, the Inspector General.
Excellency, he took bribes, he drank all my wine... he yelled out the window, he even made love to my wife.
How could I doubt that he was an Inspector General.
I mean, he gave us no chance... to think of deception Your Majesty, I mean
Your Excellency, isn't that right Gizzy?
I ain't Gizzy, he's Gizzy, you can always tell by the strawberry mark on my leg.
Why it's as big as a...
- I'm Gizzy, he's Izzy.
- Silence, excuse us Your Excellency.
First of all mayor, I want that tramp.
Send out every man available.
In the meanwhile, I will write out an order for his execution.
He will hang today Your Excellency,
I promise you that, test the gallows.
- I'm Izzy, then he is...
- Silence.
Citizens, here is the organ, the one that was stolen, we gave the money we had and...
- Stop.
- I'll see you in a minute.
Here, take the organ to the church, I'll be back in a minute.
Come on men, I may need you. Follow me men.
Wait here please. Attention. Oh, never mind.
I'm glad I found all of you gentlemen together.
- This town is going to be cleaned up...
- From top to bottom.
- This is the Inspector General.
- Yes mister major...
I'd like you all to know that the corruption in this city is at an end.
I want a complete and honest report from you and a complete report of your tax records.
And a report from you in the morning.
Who is this man? Tell him to get out, this is official business.
Mr. Major... in the name of The Emperor, I call upon you to produce all the tax records and...
- books of this village immediately.
- If you permit me to interrupt.
Let me show you this communication which is just arrived.
Silly girl and now to business. I...
You filthy bag of bones, this is the Inspector General.
How do you do? We must have a long talk together sometime.
I want to look at all these books...
Inspector General?
- Open up the cell.
- Yes sir.
- Hurry man.
- Yes sir.
Guards.
Take them away.
This is a huge spot, two hangings at the same time.
You'll regret this, you fat faced village idiot.
Take your dirty hands off me, you misbegotten peasants.
Tie him up.
The Emperor will tear this stinking village down over your ears.
You see being locked-up.
Heads will roll here like marbles, yours first.
And then this flea ridden sack of nothing, you call Inspector...
This isn't the Inspector
General, don't make me laugh.
The Great Emperor wouldn't appoint a thing like this for a position such important.
This is your Inspector General, here.
His courage, his manner, his bearing. Gentlemen, take your choice.
- I don't know what to think.
- You don't have to think, if this man is... the Inspector General, then were are his credentials?
Oh, where yours?
Show them, they've the right to see.
Come show them, show your credentials.
Show them.
Produce them. Here they are, see?
Your Excellency.
I would like to take this opportunity to tender my resignation.
I'm so sorry Your Excellency.
It was our mistake, the imposter will hang.
- This is preposterous.
- Silence.
If Your Excellency will be so good as to write out the death warrant.
The death warrant.
Arrest that man.
I'm warning you, I'm warning all of you, this will be reported to the Emperor.
Lock him up.
- I can't do it.
- Why not?
One thing, I can't write, I can't read either.
And even if I could write,
I couldn't sign this death warrant.
- I'm not the Inspector General.
- He's just soft hearted, here I'll sign it.
- You can't do it.
- Alright, you can't...
It's all over.
I couldn't sign this, that man is completely innocent, I...
I only did it so I get the money to buy the organ back.
Lock them up again, put them in chains, send them to the gallows.
Oh Your Excellency, I'm so sorry.
Something like this is never happened in Brodny before.
I assure you they'll go to the gallows Your Excellency.
The gallows will wait its turn, but not now.
- But, but Your Excellency...
- This man will not hang.
First honest man I've met since I left Budapest.
Well, if you say...
- My, my chain of office Your Excellency.
- We'll put something else around your neck.
- Thank you Your Excellency.
- With band music?
- What you say?
- With band music?
With band music.
I couldn't take this Your Excellency.
I can't even read or write, I...
- I have no education and...
- What you have is much better.
My medal and my sash.
Citizens of Brodny, I have the honor to present to you, your new Mayor.
Hello, Mrs Simmons...Mary.
Hello, Mr Haskel.
Here's your shirt, Jimmy.
I turned the cuffs. Thanks.
Little enough for letting Mary practise here. Oh, it's all right.
How is she doing? Encourage her.
If she practises, she'll be good.
I'll be back in an hour.
OK. I'll take good care of her.
Hop to it, Mary.
Mary, give me an "A", please.
SHE PLAYS A NOTE
HE TUNES UP
That's it. OK, thanks.
SHE STARTS TO PLAY AGAIN
When are you going to get new records? You haven't worn out those.
Won't be long now.
Hi, Tommy. Tomatoes for my last lesson. Tomorrow, I'll bring bacon.
OK, here's your horn. I think you left your music over there.
PIANO CONTINUES IN BACKGROUND
LONG, LOW TOOT
HE RUNS THROUGH SOME SCALES

HE PLAYS A JAZZY TUNE
SHARP, DISCORDANT NOTES
Uncle Charlie, glad to see you!
Jimmy, I'm glad to see you, too.
What brings you here? I came because you didn't answer my letter.
I wanted time to think it over.
Come in, Uncle Charlie.
TROMBONE AND PIANO PLAY LOUDLY
I...I wrote you...
I wrote you three months ago!
Was it that long? You know how it is, a fella gets busy.
With these things, you have to change the oil every thousand miles.
HE PLAYS AGAIN
Jimmy! Jimmy!
I came up to have an important talk with you. Go ahead. I'm listening.
Can't we go some place without this infernal racket?!
Yeah. We'll go in my room.
Where? Right over there.
Here we are.
That chair needs fixing. It's a trade for a second-hand clarinet.
Jimmy, I'm not going to beat around the bush.
As you know, we've not been close.
After all, we are the last of the Haskels. Is that very serious?
I want to keep the name of Haskel in the health-food business.
I understand. I want to keep our name in the music business.
I'm talking about BIG business.
Can't you understand?
I need you, Jimmy. Some day, you're going to get everything I've got.
But you won't get it if you fritter your life away in this town.
This whistle stop.
I like it here.
My dad was happy here.
I could never understand my brother.
I told him when he opened this place he'd never make a go of it.
It failed successfully for 25 years.
That's not bad.
If he'd listened to me, he'd have been a rich man. But, no.
What did he have when he died? The biggest funeral this town ever saw.
Everybody was there.
Everybody owed him money. Maybe so.
Dad had a wonderful time living.
He liked hunting, fishing, music.
Music!
He talked a great deal about you.
He did?
Always seemed to feel sorry for you.
Sorry?! You didn't get anything out of life. Just making money.
Is that so? Since when has making money been a crime?
I'm not going to argue with you. And
I'm not going to get upset. No, sir!
Jimmy! Jimmy!
Uncle, I'm sorry.
Don't hit him. He's an old man.
It was the chair.
Are you hurt? Don't mind me.
Hello, Bud. Can I talk to you?
Yeah, outside here.
Excuse me a minute, Uncle Charlie.
Afraid I've got some bad news.
What's the trouble, Bud?
I'm to take up this attachment unless you've got money.
Take it up. Unless you think eggs are gonna go up to 500 a dozen.
See what you can do. I'll hold this off as long as I can. Thanks, Bud.
He was just telling me about some people that wanted musical instruments.
He's the sheriff. How do you know?
I knew his father.
He was serving a paper on your father the first time I was here.
Well, you can stay here chasing rainbows or I can show you a real pot of gold.
I...I... Wait. That's a good idea for my radio show tomorrow night.
You've heard my Happiness Hour of course. Everybody's heard it.
Once. Listen to this.
Clouds that make the day so grey must sooner or later pass away.
There's a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Homespun philosophy.
Oh, boy.
I've got to be going.
What are you going to do?
Unless a miracle happens in the next few days, looks like I'll slide right down that rainbow. Fine.
And land right in the pot.
What was I saying? And furthermore...
And furthermore, I see no reason...
< LOUD BOOM
What was I saying? And furthermore...
I see no reason to change the air guns we use to puff rice and cereals.
< LOUD BOOM
Our air guns are exceptionally quiet.
I therefore would suggest...
LOUD MUSIC
There goes that band again.
Oh, I'll settle this.
JAZZ MUSIC
How can a man transact business with that going on?
Tom-toms, jungle screeches.
They're a menace to sanity.
What did I say? Tom-toms and jungle screeches. No, that's what I mean.
The McCorkles took that band in to annoy me.
That's why they've ignored my protests.
It's a new band. Who wants a new band? Let them do it in a cave.
Boom-boom-boom-boom-boom!
Walawalawala!
I'll settle this once and for all.
Hey! Hey!
You! Hey!
Hey, you! Somebody, hey!
< Hey! Hey!
What's the matter?
Stop that blasted bedlam or I'll have it stopped!
Oh, you will, eh? You and who else?
The police! I'll have them thrown in jail for disturbing the peace.
Disturbing the peace?
LOUD BOOM
What about that air gun booming all day and night?
I suppose that's a baby's lullaby, you white-headed old baboon.
That boom is this business.
Besides, we're all used to it.
The band is business. You can get used to it. I'll get an injunction.
Oh, you will, eh? Listen, you black-hearted old skinflint.
You want me to sell my house so you can enlarge your factory.
I'm not selling. Not at your price.
Call the cops if you think you can have this band thrown out.
You just wait! You'll find out!
PLAYS DOLEFUL TUNE
Go ahead, boys. Go to it, but loud.
Jasper. Go and get Jasper.
Jasper! Jasper!
Find him.
Don't stand there like a dummy.
Do I have to do everything? Jasper!
Do you want me, CJ? Why aren't you here when I need you?
Get the police. The police?
The militia if necessary.
That woman has insulted me for the last time. You said that before.
This time I mean it.
That band is driving me insane.
It certainly is. Have them arrested.
I will. Good.

That'll be all. Thank you.
Here, stupid. Well, take it.
Thank you.
Come on. Too bad you can't carry a few bundles without complaining.
I don't mind carrying them.
Well, who are you?
I'm the guy carrying the bundle.
Thanks. I thought my brother
Willy was behind me.
He went ahead of you. I'm terribly sorry. You must have been surprised.
Life in the city is one surprise after another. For instance?
Band music coming down out of the sky. That's up on our roof.
On your roof? The band is on the house, until we get a job.
Are you with the band? My sister
Donna and I sing. Mother feeds it.
It certainly is a swell band.
Not everyone agrees with that.
You mean the neighbours object?
No. The neighbours are...
Uh-oh. Here comes trouble.
As you can see, Miss McCorkle,
I'm here with the law.
For protection?
No. This is your last warning.
That music must cease!
< I'm coming, Molly.
What does this weasel want?
As if I didn't know. No violence.
Speak to her, officer.
Hello, Mom.
You're in bad company.
I'm here to give you an ultimatum.
That band are disturbing the entire neighbourhood.
The entire neighbourhood? Does it disturb you, Mrs Papadalis?
No. It keeps me young. Disturbing the peace. And you, Mrs Sweeney?
My old man can't fight when he hears music.
They will, will they?
The hoodlums, the ruffians.
Go back to your kennel and tell old man Haskel what you've heard.
What's going on? You've heard of the Hatfield and McCoy feud?
This is between the McCorkles and the Haskels. Who? Come on.
What are you doing?
Looking for a nice soft one.
Oh, quit kicking me!
Look out. Now, just a minute.
Just a minute. You might miss him.
Down.
You hoodlums! You'll pay for this!
Now.
Stand aside...
I hit the wrong man.
No, you hit the right man.
Run! No, wait. Come on.
They got me. It's blood!
I've been shot. I've been stabbed.
You're all right, CJ. I'm not all right. Call an ambulance.
It isn't blood, CJ. It isn't blood?
What is it? Tomato juice.
LAUGHTER
All's clear. Come on in.
Boy, you sure do know your back yards and fences.
I'd have been faster without you.
I didn't want you to carry my case.
Have a doughnut, hero.
It's the best I can offer.
Hero? Me? You certainly are.
They may put up a statue of you, like the discus fellow.
It was an accident - hitting my... that man. It was a stroke of genius.
Everybody hates Haskel. Why?
I could give you a reason for every dollar he's got in the bank.
He's trying to drive us out because he hates music. What a stinker.
The name of Haskel is poison around here.
It is?
Well...
I guess I'd better be going.
What's your hurry?
I have to find a place to live.
I was going to live with a relative.
If you'd like a place where there's never a dull moment...
What's going on? What do you want?
He needs a place to live. Are you in a band or are you paying?
This is the fellow that hit Haskel with a tomato.
Oh, glory be.
You darling!
Why didn't you tell me?
So, you're the fella.
Don't look any further. You're living with us. Give me the bag.
That's nice, but... No buts. The best room is none too good for you.
Whether you can pay for it or not.
Give me the bag. ..Willy!
We've been looking for you.
I've finished that arrangement.
Take this bag up to the big room.
Does anybody else carry anything?
Stop grumbling.
Let me see it, Horace.
These changes are swell.

Boys, look who's here. Grady.
Grady!
Oh, Molly!
Grady's been pounding the beat out by the dumps.
A little argument with old man Haskel.
You should have been here.
You'd have been even for life.
What happened? Oh, boy. Plenty.
< What they call poetic justice.
It must've been good.
It was perfect.
Well, come on. Come on. Out with it.
Old man Haskel came steaming over here, and he got hit with a tomato.
< Right in the kisser.
It was a soft one, naturally.
The hit-and-run kind.
Nobody knows who did it, I hope.
Nobody but me. But I'm big-hearted.
Boys, meet the sharpshooter.
Molly McCorkle, will you never learn to keep your big mouth shut?
What did I say? Too much.
Open up, boys. Open up.
Open up. Open up.
My boy, you should have a medal.
Instead, I have to give you this.
Thanks very much. What is it?
A warrant for assault and battery.
Old man Haskel swore it out.
Come on, son.
Wait. Wait a minute.
Wouldn't you like to give me a good kick before you go?
It's OK. It's been fun here.
I enjoyed jumping over those fences.
If I get this thing straightened out...I hope you let me come back.
And thanks for that doughnut.
It was... It was all right.
Er...well, come on, Grady.
Yeah, yeah.
Next case.
Hold everything.
We'll be right there.
Molly, where are you? Come on!
Order! Order in the court room!
Mrs McCorkle, sit down.
Listen, Mike. Don't get on your high horse with me. Sit down!
Now, what's this case all about?
Young man, what's your name?
My name?
I'd prefer your real name.
Er...well, my name is...
James Hamilton...
James Hamilton. Put that down.
Where do you live, James Hamilton?
He lives with us.
419, 63rd Street.
Tell me, James, how did you get enmeshed in the coils of the law?
I threw a tomato.
LAUGHTER
He's too modest, Mike.
Hit him with a bull's-eye right in old man Haskel's face.
He did?
LAUGHTER
Where were we? I'd just thrown the tomato, Your Honour.
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Now tell me, Jimmy, my boy, did you with premeditation and intent aim at Mr Haskel's face? Well...
He refuses to answer on the grounds that he might incriminate himself.
You certainly know the law.
Having weighed the evidence, the court rules that the case be postponed and the defendant released on bail.
Provided anybody has any money.
Is 200 enough?
That was the exact sum the court had in mind. Who has it?
I have it, Your Honour.
The clerk will accept it.
Next case. Thank you, Mike.
Stand aside, please. >
Move over Who are you pushing? Take it easy, will you? Don't push me!
Here comes double pneumonia. Open the windows. I smell stale tomatoes.
Very funny, Mrs McCorkle.
Very funny.
I wish it'd been you who threw that tomato. I'd have put a rock in it.
You would, would you? Well...
JUDGE STRIKES GAVEL
Proceed with the case, judge.
I'm here.
Where's the man that assaulted me?
I'll conduct this case without any advice from you. That's telling him.
< Move along.
In you go.
All right, take it away, Eddie.
I bring a charge against the hoodlum.
Before I give evidence, he's allowed to walk out right under your nose.
First, he wasn't under my nose.
Second, he was released on bail.
Third, you're in contempt of court.
I sentence you to 25 days or 25.
That ain't enough, Mike.
Quiet.
This is an outrage, a travesty of justice. 50 dollars or 50 days.
What? Make up your mind. It's worth
50 to tell you what I think.
Is it worth 100? All right.
But you wait until the next election.
You wait until... I'm waiting.
Until... Your Honour, it appears that I haven't any money with me.
Take him away, bailiff. You can't do this to me! You can't do this to me!

Music? Even in jail I hear music.
You'll get used to it.
Let me down. Take your hands off of me. Stop this nonsense.
You're nothing but hoodlums!
Jimmy, my boy. Uncle Charlie, fancy meeting you here.
It's a miscarriage of justice.
They can't do this.
Why are you here?
Just another country boy who got mixed up with evil companions.
What's wrong?
Too many prisoners.
Someone sneaked in.
What?
Defrauding the taxpayers, that's what it is.
Gangway. Line up there. Line up.
You, what's your name? Haskel.
OK. We've got a Haskel.
Stand over there.
What's your name? Haskel.
A wise guy, huh?
I suppose you're all Haskel.
ALL: Yeah.
What's your initial? James H.
I got no James H nothing.
So you're the stowaway.
You ought to be locked up.
James, my wallet is in my office.
Get it and pay my fine.
I'll be right back. So long, fellas.
ALL: So long, Jimmy.
Hey, can you sing?
No. I hate music. We've got to do something about this, boys.
Say "Ah"!
ALL: Ahhhhhh!
Hey! Jimmy, where have you been?
Yeah, yeah.
Well... Me? I...
I'll have to... What's the matter?
We've been looking all over town for you. What for? What for? Come on.
Hey, here's Jim.
Molly, Jimmy's here. What did I say?
I knew he'd come back.
Where have you been?
I got locked up by mistake.
You had the boys worried.
They thought you'd run out on them.
So what? They pawned their instruments for your bail.
Molly's idea. Oh, well, thanks.
Nice to know
I'm worth 200 on the hoof.
First call for dinner!
You're back. You'll eat at the first table. Look after him, Molly.
Don't touch a thing. Get up, all of you. What's the matter, Ma?
We've got a new member to the clan.
You sit here.

Tomatoes? Thank you.
Well, help yourself.
No tomatoes.
What's the matter? Nothing. Nothing.
Er, would you excuse me? I don't feel very well. Too much excitement.
Maybe you're right. The jail and everything. I'll get some fresh air.
Willy, you'd better go with him.
Sure. You don't...
Maybe I'd be better off if I went up to my room.
Willy, show him his room.
I do everything except eat.
If you want anything, just holler.

HE CROAKS: Where have you been?
You'll be sorry for this.
Look what they've done to my voice.
How am I going to broadcast the Happiness Hour?
Couldn't you call it off? What?!
Say you lost your voice singing in a jail. Don't be ridiculous!
Ladies and gentlemen, due to circumstances beyond our control...
We bring you the
Haskel Happiness Hour.
Makers of Haskel Pattycakes
- the health food supreme.
HE CROAKS: Ladies and gentlemen...
I can't do it. I'm croaking.
Jimmy, you do it. Oh, no. Oh, no.
Mr Haskel will be with you soon.
Ladies and gentlemen! Ssh! Ssh!
HE WHISPERS: Tonight, I want to share a little poem with you.
We...all should be grateful and happy as kings,
The world is so full of such wonderful things,
The rain and the sun help the earth to grow wheat...
Hey, Willy. What do you want?
Listen to this.
The sun on the oceans...
Forget about him...
Just listen for a moment.
The pansies... The pansies and lilies, the primrose so fickle,
They're ours to enjoy without spending a nickel.
Good evening, sir.
LOSING HIS VOICE: Evening, Parks.
Parks...is the guest room in order?
Certainly, sir.
This is my nephew, Mr James Haskel.
BOTH WHISPERING: Oh.
How do you do, sir? Same to you.
Is your luggage in the car, sir?
I just had one suitcase...
CROAKY: Why are you whispering?
You started it, sir.
I lost my voice, singing. You?
I'll get my suitcase.
We have everything here.
Come on.
HE RASPS: Here you are, my boy.
This is all yours from now on.
I'm so happy to have you with me at last. Thanks.
In case you need anything.
That's fine.
We'll have breakfast at 7.30. Then
I'll take you over to the factory.
I'll put you on the payroll. I don't imagine you've got much money.
Your cashier cashed a cheque for me.
Your personal cheque?
For how much? It was certified.
214. That's what was left when I closed up shop.
That dismal episode is behind you for ever, my boy.
Tomorrow is another day. With more music by the McCorkles, probably.
Jimmy, that old lady is deliberately trying to wreck my health.
Why? Because I want her property.
That's unreasonable. It's getting on my nerves. I can't stand it.
Why don't you go on a vacation?
The McCorkles will think they chased me out of town. That's what they want.
Nothing will stand in the way of my getting the man who hit me with that tomato!
This is my room if you want me.
I'm going to take a hot bath and go to bed. Good night, Jimmy.
Goodbye, Uncle Charlie.

Hello. Hello. Is anything wrong?
We heard you on the radio. You did?
Wasn't I terrible?
Did Molly hear it? No. That's good.
What goes on between you and CJ Haskel?
I'll tell you, he's my uncle.
Oh, yeah? Here. I'll prove it to you.
Here's a letter to James Hamilton
Haskel. Want to read it? No.
What is this? Why are you here?
I almost forgot what I came for.
There's 200 for your instruments.
Did you get that from your uncle?
You don't know my uncle.
Thank you, Jim.
That's OK. I like the people here.
Especially... I like everybody.
I'd like to live here.
But as soon as Molly finds out...
Suppose she doesn't find out.
That would be nice, but...
You didn't have to get that dough.
I'm for you, Jimmy. Horace?
Sure thing.
Well, thanks very much.
I've still got troubles. Sooner or later, Molly will find out who I am.
Just like old man Haskel will find out who threw that tomato.
It just won't work.
Either way, I'm a dead duck.
How's your uncle going to find out?
He'll see me at the trial.
What if he didn't show up?
They'll throw the case out. We'll get rid of Uncle Charlie. How?
Red can run over him with the wagon.
Do you think he would? You couldn't!
Red'd love it. I'll get him.
Wait. Couldn't you do something not quite so drastic?
Any ideas? Yeah, I think
I'd better go back to Point Jurvis.
Uncle Charlie's tough. You'd better find someplace else to rehearse.
So long, Horace.
Willy, thanks for everything.
Jim, wait. That's it. The band.
He doesn't like it.
No, he certainly does not.
Come on.

What are you doing? Who is this man?
I was worried about you. This is
Professor Heidt, Uncle Charlie.
I don't need a doctor.
I eat my own health foods.
It's my nerves that are cracking.
I'm here to work on your nerves.
Relax, please.
How can anybody relax with that music going on?
Music?
Music?
BOTH: What music?
That creepy music.
Don't you hear it?
You see what I mean, Professor?
I tell you, I hear music!
Maybe it's the radio in the library.
It's not the radio. You still hear it? Yes, it's still playing.
Where does this music seem to be coming from?
I don't know.
Just a moment, I'll tell you.
It's here. It's plainer down here.

At least you're not seeing things.
There's nothing wrong with me.
Jimmy, look! What do you see?
What do you want us to see?
Girls dancing. Where?
There!
Sees paper dolls dancing on lawn.
Paper dolls. You're right.
I'm in a terrible shape.
My nerves are all gone.
What do you think I should do?
Give your nerves a long rest.
Get out of town. I'll do it.
I'll go up in the woods.
We'll help you pack. Not until I find the man who threw that tomato.
Your health is more important than a silly tomato.
That's right. Let me handle this.
I'll find him.
He's as good as in jail. Almost.
While you're resting, he'll be taken care of. I'll do it.
Good. I'll take the first train out in the morning.
What's the matter now?
The music's stopped.
All but the bull fiddle.
You're improving already.
Yes.
Hi. What can I do for you?
Hello, Mr Louderman.
Could we make the Haskel Happiness
Hour happier? Welcome, stranger.
Sit down. What'll you have? Well...
Hello, Mr Baccus.
What's this meeting about?
To discuss the programme.
I'm in charge during Mr Haskel's absence. He trusts me. Not 100%.
I beg your pardon? My uncle has given me charge of the programme.
It didn't take long to undermine me.
You could have written it.
There'll be no changes...
I'd like to talk to you.
Yes, we should talk this over.
I'll be right back.
PUNCHES ARE THROWN >

Why do you want them on his programme? It'll give them a break.
Then they'll have to thank my uncle.
He'll feel good. Up in Canada?
There's a feud going on. A feud?
Then there's a girl.
Oh, a girl. Yeah.
Sounds pretty confusing, doesn't it?
No. It sounds pretty good. It does?
You play Thursday night at the Eastchester Country Club.
How did you do it? I talked, he listened. I'm as surprised as you.
How much do we get for it?
Nothing. You don't get anything.
What of it? We don't get money for playing to the neighbours.
At least this way there's a chance.
I'm sold. What can we lose?
It's OK with me.
Give me a push.

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
The Haskel Happiness Hour
'from Eastchester Country Club.'
Country club?
The first appearance of a new band...
Music? On my programme?
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Horace Heidt.
The first number is Broadway
Caballero, featuring Molly McCorkle.
McCorkle?
And here she is, the charming Molly.
# He's disarming, alarming
Charming and gay
# First, he steals your heart
Then he throws it away
# He will tell you of tropical nights
# Make you dream of a thousand delights
# First, he'll hold your hand
Say you're simply grand
# Soon you're thinking his way
# Caballero
He's never been south of the border
# He's never been Argentine way
# When he starts to pet
The chances are you'll forget
# That he's a Caballero from Broadway
# South on Broadway
# He'll hold you and say "Senorita, right here in my arms you must stay"
# And from his dialect You'd never suspect
He's the Caballero from Broadway
# South on Broadway
# His daytime, he spends parading on the Avenue
# Then, later, you'll find me with a girl or two and a third in view
# He'll take you to all the gay places
# He'll make every Latin cafe
# He'll give you such a thrill
Then he'll hand you the bill
# This charming
Caballero from Broadway
# South on Broadway
# When Madame Lazanga learned the conga, I swear
# I gave her the lessons, then I gave her the air
# It seemed to be love in bloom
And then suddenly, boom!
# Another girl took over from there
# I know if you meet him you are likely to fall
# His methods are sense because he catches them all
# He'll sing you a serenade tenderly played on an old mail-order guitar
# He'll bring up the subject of dancing
# And all of his pupils will say
# He's such an awful crumb but no-one dances the rumba
# like the Caballero from Broadway
# South on Broadway
# He'll tell you he lives in
Argentina's biggest house
# But we know his hacienda is a boarding house run by Senor Klaus
# He's such an impetuous fellow
He's like a dog having his day
# This phoney Don Amigo
Really comes from Oswego
# For a Caballero from Broadway
He does OK!
# You'd better lock your heart or he will tear it apart
# and then it's just the start and you're in trouble
# You think you're up on top but you are due for a drop because
# your dream will pop like a bubble
# He's the kind of man that you'll never forget,
# the diamond Caballero from Broadway
# Way down south on Broadway. #
Molly, you were wonderful.
Put this on before you catch cold.
Louderman said the band are worth
1,500 a week. 1,500 a week?
That means we're a success!
I've been double-crossed.
Get me a drink.
Bands. Country clubs. The McCorkles.
Get me a drink, do you hear?
I want to tell you something.
It took you long enough.
This is something that's been worrying me.
You don't know anything about me.
So what? You're you and I'm me.
Well... There you are. You thought you'd made an impression.
I'll tell your uncle about it.
CJ won't pay for your philandering.
Is Haskel your uncle?
Yes. If you just let me explain.
It's all perfectly obvious.
Sneaking into our home, pretending to help us. Please let me explain.
What a cheap trick. You are a Haskel. Molly, they can hear you.
That's fine!
Hello, everybody.
I have good news. Every week, Mr
Haskel, who sponsors the programme, is going to give away 1,000 in cash.
1,000 a week?! That's a lie!
Isn't that generous, folks?
APPLAUSE
Now, Mr Haskel, trick your way out of that.
MUSIC STARTS
I've got to get home. How long will it take? It'll take two days...
How long did it take to get here? A week. You'll make it back in a week.
Let's get started.
Jimmy! Jimmy! Congratulations.
That was a marvellous idea.
How did you think of it?
It came out of a clear sky.
"The Haskel Happiness Hour announced that 1,000 a week would be given away."
I read all the papers.
Here's Mr Haskel.
Your uncle's attorney - Mr Chalmers.
How do you do? Sign this paper.
What is it? A statement that you did not authorise that announcement.
She did it to damage your uncle.
Sign here. Wait a minute. Don't worry.
We can get judgment against the McCorkles.
We can take their property.
Your uncle's been trying to do that for years. Sign here, please.
I don't like to be pushed around or sign anything I haven't read. Get out of here!
Don't hit me again. I have glasses!
Mr Haskel...
Good day, sir. Good day.
Beautiful, Parks.
Thank you, sir.
Why don't you answer the phone?
Hello? Oh, Jimmy, my boy, how are you?
You want to talk to Molly.
Well, I don't think it's a very good time to...
Just a moment.
Fight your own battles. I'm not doing it for you. I don't want...
Well?
I hate to annoy you but this is important.
That 1,000 offer was my idea.
Just don't argue. If anybody asks about it, follow Grady's advice.
Don't tell me to keep my mouth shut.
Why should I?
If you don't, they'll take your home.
I don't need your help. ..What?
Don't be stupid.
I'm doing it for Mom and the boys.
Oh!
Excuse me, sir. Mr Louderman and Mr Samson. Have them come in.
Hello.
Hello, Jimmy. Congratulations.
Your programme was a knockout.
Calls from all over the country.
This is Mr Samson.
How do you do?
Mr Samson is an investigator for the federal government.
What's the government got to do with it?
We want to know how you'll give away the money. That shouldn't be hard.
Nobody has trouble giving away
1,000. It cannot be a lottery.
No raffles or drawings.
Oh, yes, I understand that.
That would be...
Well, how about a quiz contest?
It said the money would be given way over the air, not to an audience.
That sort of complicates things, doesn't it? Let's see...
Stick a pin the city directory and give that person the 1,000?
No. That would be local.
This has become national.
Let's call it off and not give away the money.
No, no. The money was promised.
I would lose my franchise. Your uncle's business would be ruined.
You could be fined and imprisoned.
Well, that's great.
I have quite a choice, don't I?
I give the money away and go to jail, or I don't and go to jail.
Hand me the salt.
Still mooning about Jimmy, huh?
You've seen the last of him.
He's probably glad he's found out what you're like. All right, Mom.
It's not all right. Jimmy deserves a girl who really loves him.
Whether his name be Haskel or Hassenpfeffer.
Well, I hope you're satisfied.
What's the matter now?
Nobody can figure out how to give away that 1,000.
Jimmy's going to jail because of it.
This is awful. But I made the offer.
He says he'll take the rap. Are you going to let him go to jail?
Jimmy said... I know why he said it. To keep a roof over our heads.
I'd rather lose our house than lose our pride.
Oh, Mom. I've been feeling the same way all week.
PHONE RINGS
Yes. ..No. ..Not yet.
Gentlemen, someone's got to think of something and soon.
The programme goes on air tonight, not next month.
We're no closer to the answer than we were a week ago.
Yes... I've got it!
It came to me just like that.
We'll get that glass bowl they use for the draft numbers. That's it.
I'm proud of you. That'll do it.
The government forbids lotteries.
No. Not yet. I'll see if I can dream up something else.
You're not sleeping. No. I'm eating aspirin tablets like peanuts.
I've got it. What?
The first time I've beat this game.
Why don't you all go to the broadcasting station? Maybe I'll think of something.
We'll get out. Samson, come on.
No. ..Not yet. Put that thing off the hook and leave it off.
Thank you, sir. Yeah.
Are you all right, Jimmy?
I'm just getting my second wind.
You'd better think of something.
7.30. Heard from Jimmy? No. Nobody answers. How are we to go on?
When it's 8 o'clock, you're on.
From coast to coast.
KNOCK ON DOOR
BUZZER
KNOCKING AND BUZZING
Coming, Mr Haskel. Coming.
About time. Why didn't you answer the telephone? You see...
How do you like that? Ow!
Come on! Wake up! Get up. I can't do it. It's against the law.
It's Molly. Get up!
Oh, it's you.
Yes, it's me. Now, come on.
I suppose you want to know how
I'm going to give away the 1,000.
I don't know. Go home. Go home?
You come down here as fast as you can. On your feet, big boy!
If you think we'll let a Haskel fight our battles, you're cuckoo.
We won't let McCorkles kick us around. Go on. Go away.
Still going to sleep, huh?
Just a second. Don't you dare.
You can't do that.
Where's the telephone?
What are you doing? I'm going to tell them what happened.
Give me that. I've made up my mind.
Let go of that phone.
No, I won't. All right.
CLOCK CHIMES
That's it!
Hands spinning around. Millions of telephones and telephone books.
Parks! And it's not a lottery.
Get my coat. Goodbye.
Ow! Oooh!
The Haskel Happiness Hour presents
Horace Heidt and his Musical Knights.
Before this programme is over, we will give away 1,000 in cash.
The method of giving it will be announced later.
# Here we come, all bright and gay
# It's the charge of the Heidt Brigade. #
Here I am, CJ.
Did you stop the programme?
It's on the air now.
I'll tear down the studio.
Why am I in the radio business?
Jimmy, have you got an idea?
This is it. Take 'em.
They're telephone books from all over the country.
Go and get the rest of them.
Gangway.
We're going to give the money away by telephone.
Cut the books into sections of 500 pages. Put numbers on each one.
Get a table.
After you. Thank you.
Nice going. Come on, Parks.
We have to go.
SHE LAUGHS
Same to you. Fine work.
Ladies and gentlemen, here's the news you've been waiting for.
'The 1,000 will be given away by telephone.' That's my money!
I won't stand for it.
I'll cancel my contract.
Get me to a telephone!
How are we going to borrow the wheel?
Come on, boys! Take home the bacon!
When I yell "Snooky", you borrow it.
What's Snooky? Get going.
Snooky! Where have you been?
Madam. Why did you leave me the way you did?
Madam, I...
Why, you're not my Snooky at all.
A character. How do you like that?
Where... I've been robbed!
Police! Get a policeman.
Police! I've been robbed!
Gangway!
Hello. May I use your telephone?
Ma, Daniel Boone wants to use our telephone!
Go away, tramp. No-one uses the phone 'til they give away the money.
Tramp? Daniel Boone?
Look out! Look out!
Fellas, help out here.
Quiet. We're on the air. I know.
You can't go in there! This ain't a hillbilly programme. Let go!
I'm no hillbilly!
CJ, when did you get here?
Louderman!
I want to talk to you!
All right, Horace. Go on.
The wheel is ready to spin for the first volume number. Take it away!
There she goes, ladies and gentlemen.
We want that volume to have your name in it.
I'm not going to give away one penny.
OK, but I've got three sponsors begging to buy this programme.
They must be crazy. Is that so?
They're from the biggest advertising agencies in America.
What?! Wait a minute!
We want you to be the one that Horace calls later.
It's going on and on and on.
And it's 124! 124!
I've got it!
We're ready for the spin to determine the page number.
The second spin to find the page in that volume we chose a moment ago.
It will have the 1,000 winner's name on it!
This is Mr Haskel. The best advertising stunt I've ever seen.
Is it good? I'll give you 20,000.
Is it that good? I'll make it 30.
Trying to steal it, huh?
She's going down to find the right page. She's stopping. Page 66.
Page 66.
I got it!
Now the final spin to determine the person who will receive the call.
Larry, take it away.
This time, all the names on the page of our chosen volume to find the name that we can send our pot of gold.
It's slowing down more and more.
There it is. Our listing is 38!
Listing number 38.
Ten. Fifteen. Twenty.
Thirty. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
It says...
The name is Mr Olaf Swenson.
3RJ, ring seven. Ring seven?
Plunkett. Plunkett, Minnesota.
Plunkett, Minnesota.
Kindly give me Mr Olaf Swenson, 3RJ, ring seven, Plunkett, Minnesota.
SECONDS ARE BEAT OUT ON PERCUSSION
PHONE RINGS
Ja, I'm coming. Keep your jacket on.
Ja. Hello?
Stop the clock, boys.
Is this Mr Olaf Swenson speaking?
Ja. That's me.
A pot of what?
A thou... You give me...
I ain't got no time for monkey business.
What?
You give me 1,000?
Helga!
Why you make my Olaf faint?
What?
A thou...
Oh!
Hello? Hello? Hello?
Folks, they're speechless.
It's my million-dollar idea. They brought you back alive. What are you doing here?
Enjoying our programme.
What are you trying to put over on me?
It belongs to me!
It does, does it? The whole thing was
Molly's idea. Molly's idea? Who is Molly?
We've got you out of the mess.
You're not liable.
Miss McCorkle is responsible for the whole thing.
You nitwits! You numbskulls!
Get out of here! Get out of here!
That's swinging them, Charlie!
Charlie?
And Molly is responsible for the whole thing.
Where are you going? Out.
Horace got the call through on the telephone. Everything's fine.
Yes. Everything's fine.
Yeah... I guess it's just one of those things.
The McCorkles are allergic to the Haskels.
I expect so. Yeah, I expect so.
Goodbye, Molly.
Bye.
Well, Jimmy? Uncle Charlie. You come with me. You're in on this, too.
Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce the people who originated what will be a permanent feature of the Haskel Happiness Hour.
Miss Molly McCorkle and my nephew, Mr James Haskel.
Tell them how happy you are.
I'd just like to tell you how happy
I am everything turned out well...
Ladies and gentlemen, she's happy because we're going to be married.
All right, Miss McCorkle, trick your way out of that one.

{2309}{2386}that it's the same city I knew|when I was a boy.
{2400}{2450}All those skyscrapers...
{2471}{2524}that steel and concrete...
{2533}{2578}those busy streets...
{2605}{2643}and the crowds.
{2673}{2717}We didn 't ha ve them.
{2744}{2807}In my day, life was more leisurely.
{2826}{2909}The women didn 't wear anything|on their faces then.
{2932}{2976}The men made up for it.
{2978}{3073}You weren 't a substantial citizen|unless you wore a mustache.
{3171}{3229}I remember I grew one myself.
{3251}{3333}But somehow, I guess|I wasn 't substantial enough.
{3953}{4021}I was living in a boarding house then...
{4025}{4083}along with other young hopefuls.
{4408}{4455}Sunday was my big day.
{4467}{4529}It was my one chance for an outing.
{4548}{4618}Sometimes I'd pick up my friend Hickey.
{4635}{4700}His uncle, Mr. Oberkugen, was my boss.
{4720}{4794}We 'd ride out to one of the parks|to meet him.
{5520}{5597}Mr. Oberkugen was|an unpredictable man on weekdays...
{5599}{5661}but on Sunday he was always happy.
{5678}{5770}Nellie was his cashier, his accountant,|and his secretary.
{5781}{5827}Had been for 20 years.
{5846}{5916}They never married. I used to wonder why.
{5968}{6068}Like all people in love, they were worried|because I had no lady friend.
{6070}{6163}They'd try to get me one,|but I had other plans.
{6209}{6299}You hold her hand, and she holds yours
{6301}{6385}and that's a very good sign
{6395}{6480}That she's your tootsie-wootsie
{6481}{6578}in the good old summertime
{6590}{6687}In the good old summertime
{6689}{6790}in the good old summertime
{6807}{6908}Strolling through the shady lanes
{6910}{6991}with your baby mine
{7000}{7102}You hold her hand, and she holds yours
{7104}{7192}and that's a very good sign
{7201}{7292}That she's your tootsie-wootsie
{7294}{7416}in the good old summertime
{7484}{7555}That Monday morning alarm|meant back to work.
{7557}{7614}Some people hated that alarm...
{7633}{7697}but not me. I had something to get up for.
{7698}{7766}You see, the post office would be open.
{7833}{7906}And that meant|there might be a letter for me...
{7908}{7969}one of those very special letters.
{8629}{8717}-I beg your pardon, madam.|-Well, I never.
{8719}{8783}-Watch where you're going.|-I'II fiX your hat for you.
{8785}{8854}-No, that's not quite the right angle.|-Leave my hat alone.
{8855}{8931}Here's your umbrella.|I don't really know what happened.
{8933}{8978}Here's your bag.
{8999}{9091}-I beg your pardon.|-For heaven's sakes.
{9167}{9231}-Leave me alone.|-I'm terribly sorry.
{9253}{9307}-Here's your hat.|-Thank you.
{9312}{9375}-Something's missing.|-Where's my bird?
{9377}{9448}Here's your bird. Here we are. I'm so sorry.
{9449}{9491}-What!|-Wrong bird.
{9496}{9565}-For heaven's sake. Thank you.|-I'II attach this.
{9567}{9608}I'm terribly sorry about this.
{9610}{9668}-I was in such a hurry.|-Watch where you're going.
{9670}{9759}-I was reading a Ietter.|-Give me that, you're crushing my hat.
{9764}{9820}I'm terribly sorry about this.
{9844}{9909}-Here's your umbrella.|-Thank you.
{9934}{10038}-Wait a minute.|-Where are you? There you are.
{10049}{10141}Here's your hat, your bird....
{10165}{10202}Is this yours?
{10250}{10332}-Here's your bag.|-Wait a minute!
{10334}{10378}The umbrella.
{10380}{10443}Parasol, I mean. I'm terribly sorry.
{10456}{10526}-PIease, madam, excuse me.|-"PIease, madam"?
{10546}{10636}Here's your bird, and here's your bag.|Now I've really got to go.
{10638}{10699}-Go.|-I've got to go to the office.
{10787}{10850}Look, here's my card.
{10860}{10943}That's where I work, see?|You go buy yourself whatever I've ruined...
{10945}{10993}and I'II be glad to pay for it. AII right?
{10994}{11053}-Thank you very much.|-Goodbye.
{11101}{11138}Wait a minute.
{11363}{11460}I was head salesman at Mr. Oberkugen 's,|getting a good salary:
{11466}{11500}$15 a week.
{11593}{11639}-Good morning, Andy.|-Good morning, Nellie.
{11641}{11688}-Good morning.|-Good morning, Hickey.
{11690}{11733}-Morning.|-Morning, Rudy.
{11735}{11786}You're Iate.|Mr. Oberkugen had to Iet us in.
{11788}{11851}I know. See, I.... Come here a minute.
{11973}{12028}Sit down. I got another Ietter.
{12030}{12136}-From the girl that advertised?|-Yeah. You wanna hear something nice?
{12145}{12183}"Dear Friend...
{12190}{12273}"my heart was trembling|as I walked into the post office...
{12275}{12352}"but there you were, Iying in BoX 237.
{12371}{12435}"I took you out of your envelope|and read you...
{12437}{12500}"read you right there, dear Friend."
{12513}{12610}But I thought she wanted to correspond|with you on intellectual subjects.
{12612}{12689}Isn't that intellectual? Positively poetry.
{12703}{12747}Wait, there's more.
{12793}{12840}"Are you short or tall?
{12859}{12913}"Are your eyes blue or brown?
{12920}{13025}"Don't tell me.|What does it matter if our minds meet?"
{13027}{13094}You're right. It is intellectual.
{13108}{13194}"There are so many wonderful things|to write about in this world of ours.
{13196}{13271}"It would be wasting precious time|if we told each other...
{13273}{13368}"the sordid details of our daily Iives,|so don't Iet's do it.
{13377}{13434}"I agree with you when you say:
{13438}{13492}""Tis happier to be dead...
{13507}{13592}"'to die for beauty than to Iive for bread."'
{13609}{13649}Did you say that?
{13674}{13734}Ralph Waldo Emerson said it first.
{13748}{13773}-Yes?
{13790}{13837}Mr. Oberkugen wants to see you.
{13845}{13915}Thanks. How is he this morning?
{13916}{13968}-Peaches and cream.|-I hope so.
{13970}{14070}How many times must I tell you?|That violin is priceless!
{14072}{14117}I'm sorry, Uncle Otto.
{14119}{14211}Don't call me Uncle Otto.|In the store, I am Mr. Oberkugen.
{14212}{14245}Yes, sir.
{14423}{14530}AII I did was pluck his violin.
{14806}{14839}That Dummkopf...
{14841}{14941}the Stradivarius,|he picks it Iike a mandolin.
{14974}{15069}It's your fault. If you'd been here on time,|it wouldn't have happened.
{15071}{15143}-Sorry, sir. I had a Iittle accident.|-It's no excuse.
{15145}{15202}Everybody can have an accident.
{15223}{15270}Did you hurt yourself?
{15302}{15388}-No, I didn't.|-Good. I hate the dangerous bicycle.
{15450}{15477}Come.
{15514}{15603}I have something to show you.|I am sure you will Iike it.
{15616}{15691}It's a surprise for the whole business.|Look.
{15706}{15783}I have a chance to buy 100 of these|from Kramer.
{15785}{15851}We can make a nice Iittle profit, no?
{15855}{15968}-What do you think of it? I think it's great.|-I'm afraid it's not for us.
{15999}{16068}-You've hardly Iooked at it.|-I don't have to. It's a harp.
{16070}{16125}Not enough people play harps.
{16134}{16191}It's wonderful how quickly you can decide.
{16193}{16312}I have been in this business 20 years.|It took me an hour to decide I Iiked it...
{16314}{16369}but you, Professor....
{16415}{16445}Hickey!
{16511}{16567}Yes, Uncle.... Mr. Oberkugen?
{16637}{16681}Miss Burke, please.
{16762}{16787}No.
{16832}{16866}Mr. Hansen!
{16924}{16983}-Yes, sir?|-Look at this, please.
{16984}{17031}What do you think of it?
{17033}{17115}Mr. Larkin doesn't happen to Iike it. I do.
{17145}{17267}But don't Iet me influence you.|I just want your honest opinion.
{17292}{17363}That's all I want, your honest opinion.
{17414}{17468}I think it's just wonderful.
{17493}{17609}-Have you changed your mind?|-No, I still say they're not for us.
{17645}{17687}I agree with Andy.
{17694}{17741}Thank you. That's all.
{17882}{17926}Now we're in for it.
{18104}{18197}This was his way of soothing himself|when things went wrong.
{18339}{18407}But he was the only one who was soothed.
{18615}{18678}Hickey knew the way to hold his job.
{19527}{19613}Good morning, madam.|May I help you? Hello, Miss....
{19619}{19681}-Fisher.|-Miss Fisher, yeah.
{19697}{19748}Looks Iike I ran up quite a bill, doesn't it?
{19750}{19821}-How much do I owe you?|-I couldn't accept anything from you.
{19823}{19916}-Really, you must.|-No, I couldn't. Really. That's definite.
{19922}{19972}-My goodness.|-This is a nice store you have.
{19974}{20033}-Thank you. We Iike it.|-It's got Iovely things.
{20035}{20121}Maybe you'd Iet me buy you something.|Is there anything here you'd Iike?
{20123}{20186}-As a matter of fact, there is.|-Fine.
{20188}{20228}No. A harmonica?
{20242}{20305}No? How about a Iittle piano?
{20307}{20362}-Music box?|-No, I want a job.
{20408}{20473}Sorry, I sold the Iast one yesterday.
{20509}{20582}See here, this is no joking matter.
{20584}{20642}That's why I was so furious|when you bumped into me.
{20644}{20719}I was all dressed up ready to go out|and Iook for a job when--
{20721}{20806}I'm sorry. We couldn't take|anyone else on now. It's the dull season.
{20807}{20854}You haven't even heard my qualifications.
{20856}{20952}I worked at Roberts Brothers,|and I worked at Gregory Music Store.
{20954}{20988}They Iiked me very much there.
{20990}{21057}They all said they'd be very happy|to have me back.
{21058}{21114}Why don't you make them happy?
{21129}{21184}Because it's the dull season.
{21187}{21276}I'm sorry. I couldn't take anyone else on.|Good day.
{21296}{21333}Just a minute.
{21363}{21414}-Do you own this store?|-No, but I--
{21415}{21449}Then I'd Iike to see the owner.
{21451}{21507}I wouldn't advise it.|He's in a very bad mood.
{21509}{21607}-I insist upon seeing the owner.|-I've been here for a number of years now.
{21609}{21693}I know him inside and out.|I know what his attitude would be.
{21695}{21752}I can tell you word for word|eXactly what he'd say.
{21753}{21789}I'II be....
{21798}{21885}-Mr. Larkin, just a moment, please.|-Excuse me, please.
{21909}{21948}-Excuse me, madam.|-Surely.
{21950}{22032}Come here. So you know all about me.
{22051}{22139}You know eXactly what I think|even before I think of it.
{22172}{22253}You are not only a business genius,|you are a mind reader.
{22255}{22306}-I wouldn't--|-Never mind.
{22372}{22405}Good morning.
{22406}{22473}-I'm Mr. Oberkugen.|-How do you do?
{22475}{22551}-How do you do? PIease have a seat.|-Thank you.
{22558}{22614}I don't know what the difficulty is...
{22616}{22704}but at Oberkugen's,|there's no such word as impossible.
{22743}{22796}What is it that you desire?
{22808}{22889}You see, I was at Gregory Brothers--
{22913}{22986}I assure you,|we have much better merchandise.
{22988}{23049}We have violins, we have flutes...
{23059}{23093}we have....
{23116}{23174}Wonderful. Something new. Look.
{23196}{23275}Some of our sales force|do not agree with me...
{23277}{23322}but I think it's charming.
{23324}{23429}I guarantee you didn't find anything|as Iovely as this at Gregory's.
{23434}{23496}I don't think you understand.
{23498}{23581}I worked at Gregory Brothers.|I'm Iooking for a job.
{23654}{23726}But wait a minute.|I play the piano and the violin.
{23728}{23809}Wait. You can play what you want,|I have no time.
{23820}{23857}Good morning.
{23951}{24007}Why do you put me|in a situation Iike that?
{24009}{24104}-I'm sorry, but it wasn't my fault.|-Whose fault was it? Mine?
{24106}{24185}-Yes, I think it was.|-What's the matter with you?
{24187}{24284}You feel to me Iike a son,|but every time you contradict me.
{24290}{24352}Whatever I say, you say no. Why?
{24373}{24432}AII right. From now on, I'II say:
{24433}{24512}"Yes, Mr. Oberkugen.|Certainly, Mr. Oberkugen."
{24683}{24730}I'II take care of this.
{24753}{24799}There's no use your waiting around.
{24801}{24870}As soon as there's an opening,|you'II be called first.
{24872}{24919}-Tell me, do you Iike it?|-Yes.
{24921}{24985}You see. Is it so hard to play?
{24987}{25065}No, anyone can Iearn. And it's so romantic.
{25080}{25130}What's romantic about it?
{25134}{25203}The soft, rippling music...
{25205}{25301}-and the way your hands....|-That's the woman's point of view.
{25377}{25471}-How much are you asking for it?|-I thought $75.
{25476}{25524}Yes, that's a bargain.
{25554}{25635}-A real bargain.|-It's a pretty harp, isn't it?
{25637}{25730}-Yes, it's a very unusual one.|-I was really Iooking for a song.
{25731}{25795}May I help you?|Here's a very popular song of the day.
{25797}{25871}I knew you sang. I could tell by your voice.
{25872}{25966}Of course, for anyone who sings,|the harp is so flattering. Your hands....

{31658}{31732}-Hello, baby.|-Mrs. Spring's Jerome.
{31736}{31797}She had to go down and pay her gas bill.
{31798}{31842}Tell me, what kind of a position?
{31843}{31922}It's in a music store,|and the boss is a darling.
{31938}{32040}-Any other gentlemen?|-Yes, I think there are three of them.
{32075}{32149}-Hand me that Iace, dear.|-Which, this one?
{32153}{32245}There's the boss' nephew,|and then there's a Mr. Hansen.
{32250}{32294}Are they young men?
{32307}{32391}One of them is a young man.|Mr. Larkin, he's a head salesman.
{32393}{32480}He's the one who didn't want|to give me the position.
{32492}{32587}Anyway, I went over his head|and went to the boss and got the job.
{32588}{32696}-I don't think he Iikes me at all.|-I nearly forgot. I went by the post office.
{32698}{32803}There was another Ietter|in the box for you. It's there on the table.
{32840}{32928}This makes my day perfect.
{33199}{33240}"Dear Friend...."
{33373}{33414}"Dear Friend...."
{34378}{34459}-You don't eat. Why?|-I've had enough, Joe. Thanks.
{34461}{34536}-If you ask me, you are in Iove.|-You think so?
{34538}{34611}-I know. She don't eat, too.|-Who?
{34624}{34663}He asks me who.
{34681}{34729}AII the time Iike this.
{34738}{34830}Then, when you come in, she.... Look.
{34957}{35007}I knew it, just Iike that.
{35737}{35775}Just a minute.
{35814}{35865}-Hello.|-Hello. That was fine.
{35867}{35908}-Did you recognize it?|-Sure.
{35910}{35964}That was the music|you sent me Iast night.
{35966}{36034}I thought it might do for your audition.
{36047}{36112}Haven't you sent your application in yet?
{36113}{36222}-No, I'm afraid I haven't.|-Don't Iet me down.
{36268}{36348}I was telling my Iady friend|about you only today.
{36404}{36451}Your Iady friend?
{36453}{36560}Yes. I was telling her how you're going|to win the scholarship and go to Leipzig...
{36561}{36625}and how you'II be famous|and that one day I'd boast...
{36627}{36715}that I used to Iive|in the same boarding house with you.
{36717}{36793}I never heard you speak|about your Iady friend before.
{36795}{36840}Really? That's funny.
{36854}{36952}That's been going on for quite a while.|I thought I'd told you.
{36976}{37025}After all, why should you?
{37027}{37099}We never spoke about much but music,|did we?
{37101}{37141}No, that's true.
{37304}{37330}I have to go.
{37332}{37391}About that scholarship,|you'd better get busy on it.
{37393}{37431}I haven't a chance to win.
{37433}{37510}Of course you have,|if you put your mind to it.
{37518}{37597}I'II bring you music every night,|and even a decent violin to play.
{37599}{37634}How's that?
{37643}{37715}I've got a stake in your career, you know.
{37717}{37773}AII right, I'II send in|the application tomorrow.
{37774}{37818}-Good girl.|-Thanks.
{38146}{38234}I often wondered|if the girl I was corresponding with...
{38236}{38294}was as wonderful as her letters.
{38363}{38463}September and October passed,|and I was still writing letters...
{38473}{38536}and still trying to sell those harps.
{38538}{38602}Do you think Eric would Iike|that gramophone?
{38604}{38685}I don't know, but it's very pretty.
{38764}{38851}Pardon me, I can't see very well|without my glasses.
{38856}{38929}Can you tell me how much|that charming Iittle harp is?
{39018}{39130}You certainly get wonderful values here.|I wonder how Oberkugen can do it.
{39137}{39208}If you don't know, Mr. Oberkugen,|who does?
{39445}{39494}-Good morning.|-Morning.
{39566}{39617}They Iook fine, the harps.
{39630}{39689}I wish the customers thought so.
{39768}{39849}-Good morning, Uncle.... Mr. Oberkugen.|-Morning.
{39874}{39949}Good morning.|We're having a wonderful morning.
{39951}{40024}-Yeah?|-Yes, I just sold my third gramophone.
{40190}{40233}Good morning, Otto.
{40250}{40361}I've been Iooking over the bills.|We ought to attend to some of these....
{40396}{40459}They shouldn't have Ieft that there.
{40516}{40550}I Iove it.
{40566}{40664}Of all the instruments,|the harp is perhaps the most beautiful.
{40671}{40782}Look at it, the classic Iines,|the mysterious tones...
{40784}{40851}it seems to come from the air.|It's wonderful.
{40852}{40927}You don't have to keep them.
{40963}{41033}Kramer will take them back.|We're good customers.
{41035}{41084}We've given them|a Iot of business this year.
{41086}{41186}-AII you have to do is to eXplain--|-Wait a minute. What should I eXplain?
{41188}{41267}But you can see for yourself,|we've had them for two months.
{41269}{41309}Nobody will buy them.
{41311}{41365}-I'II call up Kramer.|-You shouldn't call.
{41367}{41415}They will sell, I know.
{41425}{41474}PIease give them time.|This is my business.
{41476}{41547}Very well. There's the bill for them.
{41556}{41650}I've done the best I can.|I never saw such a man. Stubborn!
{41721}{41811}-$19.75 out of $20, please.|-May I have your sales check?
{41824}{41857}Certainly.
{41859}{41959}Let's see. That's $241 worth of business|I've done already this morning.
{41961}{42023}-Splendid.|-So you see, you were wrong.
{42024}{42094}This shop could stand|another salesperson.
{42104}{42159}10 cents, 20 cents, 25 cents.
{42169}{42252}I think you're angry because I sold a harp|and you couldn't.
{42254}{42314}On the contrary, I'm delighted.
{42318}{42423}-I only wish you could sell the other 99.|-Who knows? I may.
{42490}{42571}Thank you very much.|PIease come and see us again soon.
{42572}{42659}It's always nice to see you.|I'II open the door for you.
{42661}{42712}-Just a moment, please.|-Yes, sir.
{42714}{42757}Could you tell me how this goes?
{42758}{42845}-I'd be very glad to play it for you here.|-Thank you.
{42850}{42952}This is a very popular song of the day.|I think you might Iike it.
{43002}{43096}Put your arms around me, honey|hold me tight
{43102}{43195}Huddle up and cuddle up|with all your might
{43207}{43277}Oh, babe, won 't you
{43289}{43370}Excuse me. Would you Iike a Iittle help?
{43411}{43476}-AII right.|-Fine. From the beginning?
{43552}{43596}I'II sing the verse.

{49026}{49067}Dear Friend....
{49761}{49845}Dear Friend....
{50564}{50635}If only once you'd admit|you'd made a mistake.
{50637}{50740}In all the years I've known you,|I've yet to hear you say, "I was wrong."
{50742}{50833}AII right. You will hear me say it now.|I was wrong.
{50853}{50899}For 20 years I have been wrong...
{50901}{50961}thinking I could marry a woman|who spies on me.
{50962}{51028}-A woman who spies on you?|-Yes, spies on me.
{51094}{51167}It Iooks as if we're going|to have a white Christmas.
{51169}{51199}Does it?
{51238}{51292}I thought it did. I don't know...
{51294}{51407}why he gives me a different answer|every time I ask him a simple question.
{51601}{51671}-Morning.|-Morning.
{51756}{51870}-I'm glad someone is happy.|-This is gonna be a big day in my Iife.
{51903}{51968}Say, do you mind if I ask you|a personal question?
{51970}{52007}No, go ahead.
{52017}{52076}Suppose a fellow Iike me|wants to get married.
{52078}{52151}-Congratulations.|-No, I said "suppose."
{52153}{52219}For instance, suppose I wanna|get a three-room flat...
{52221}{52284}one of those things|with a bedroom and a dining room...
{52286}{52322}-and a Iiving--|-Dining room?
{52324}{52404}-What do you want a dining room for?|-Where will we eat?
{52406}{52482}In the kitchen.|You get yourself a big kitchen.
{52488}{52590}-Where will we entertain?|-What are you, an ambassador?
{52602}{52716}Listen, if a friend is really a friend,|he comes after dinner.
{52718}{52783}Yeah, but suppose after we get married....
{52785}{52847}-I haven't even asked her yet.|-Who?
{52859}{52943}That young Iady you were corresponding|with on intellectual subjects.
{52944}{52972}That's the one.
{52974}{53049}Anyway, after a while,|we got around to the subject of Iove...
{53051}{53161}-on a very intellectual plane, of course.|-How else can you in a Ietter?
{53170}{53243}So tonight we'II meet for the first time|at Heinkel's Restaurant.
{53245}{53312}-Isn't that wonderful?|-How will you know her?
{53314}{53374}She's gonna carry a carnation|and a book of poetry.
{53376}{53476}-Very appropriate. And you?|-I'm gonna wear one in my buttonhole.
{53508}{53591}She's the most wonderful girl.|She's got such high ideals...
{53593}{53648}-such delicacy of feeling.|-Good morning.
{53650}{53729}I'II tell you more Iater.|Here comes the duchess.
{53815}{53898}-Someone else is happy today.|-Good morning, Mr. Hansen.
{53900}{53938}Morning, Miss Fisher.
{53960}{54024}-I know, I'm Iate.|-No.
{54037}{54123}That shirtwaist you wore yesterday,|the yellow one with the green dots?
{54125}{54221}No, as usual you're wrong again.|It was a green one with yellow dots.
{54225}{54290}Everyone else seemed to think|it was very becoming.
{54292}{54383}As I recall, I've never mentioned anything|about those neckties you wear.
{54385}{54450}And believe me, if you think I couldn't,|you're crazy.
{54452}{54506}-My neckties are--|-So Ieave my shirtwaist alone.
{54508}{54584}-It's none of your business.|-Mr. Oberkugen seems to think it is.
{54586}{54654}-That's right. I'm working under you.|-Let's not forget it.
{54656}{54704}From now on, I'II phone you|every morning...
{54705}{54780}and tell you eXactly what I'II wear.|Is that all right?
{54781}{54850}If you want to dress up|Iike a circus pony, go ahead.
{54851}{54919}But I don't want the boss|taking it out on me.
{54921}{54957}Listen here...
{54959}{55040}I sold just as much as anybody else|in that shirtwaist yesterday.
{55042}{55087}-Really?|-Did you tell Mr. Oberkugen that?
{55089}{55122}-I did.|-And what did he say?
{55124}{55189}-He said, "Tell her not to wear it."|-Tell him I won't.
{55191}{55222}-I will.|-Thank you.
{55223}{55265}Don't mention it.
{55590}{55648}I didn't know it was over.
{55671}{55755}You know that green blouse|that I had on yesterday?
{55761}{55810}-The one with the Iittle yellow dots?|-Yes.
{55812}{55874}-I think it's Iovely.|-Did you Iike it? I'm so glad.
{55876}{55931}Because I have an important|engagement tonight...
{55932}{56037}and I didn't know whether to wear that|or something a Iittle more formal.
{56039}{56130}-I always think....|-Morning, everybody.
{56132}{56163}Morning.
{56254}{56308}-Good morning, Miss Fisher.|-Good morning.
{56507}{56575}May I tell you, you Iook charming today?
{56651}{56772}What do you say we dress up tonight,|have an early dinner, and go to the opera?
{56778}{56872}-I'm sorry, I can't.|-What is it? You don't feel well?
{56875}{56948}I feel very well, thank you.|I have another engagement.
{56950}{57050}You can get out of it.|EXplain it to her and she will understand.
{57059}{57165}What makes you so sure it's a woman?|I have men friends, too, you know.
{57220}{57300}You are not going out with another man?
{57305}{57408}-Yes, I am.|-You couldn't do such a thing.
{57433}{57485}And who's going to stop me?
{57643}{57675}Yes, sir?
{57698}{57775}Will you please tell everybody|to stay after work tonight?
{57777}{57827}We are taking inventory.
{57882}{57941}-Tonight?|-Yes, tonight!
{57969}{58044}There are a Iot of things on our shelves|that are not moving.
{58045}{58095}I should Iike to know what they are.
{58097}{58180}I want a thorough check made|of all our merchandise.
{58259}{58342}Is it absolutely necessary|that I stay here tonight?
{58344}{58421}Because I've got|such an important engagement...
{58449}{58552}-and could you possibly spare me?|-That's entirely up to Mr. Larkin.
{58582}{58629}Could you get along without Miss Fisher?
{58631}{58746}As a matter of fact, I was about to ask you|if I could have tonight off, too.
{58760}{58828}What is it? Does everybody want to Ieave?
{58830}{58917}-Once a year, I ask you to stay here.|-If it wasn't such an important--
{58919}{58970}I see, you want a special invitation.
{58972}{59040}Next time|I'II send you an engraved announcement.
{59041}{59139}-I think we can manage without Andrew.|-Did I ask you for advice?
{59141}{59207}-No.|-Uncle Otto, I can take--
{59209}{59290}Tonight is inventory. Everybody stays.
{59320}{59357}That's final.
{59685}{59783}-Number K52T, four.|-I thought you said three.
{59790}{59868}Those are banjo cases. Metronomes, six.
{59874}{59914}-Got it?|-Got it.
{59931}{59970}Small harps, 99.
{60022}{60111}-Got it?|-You just Iove to rub that in, don't you?
{60119}{60207}-I am merely taking inventory.|-No matter what I do, it's wrong.
{60209}{60255}If I wrap a package, it's wrong.
{60257}{60361}You want everything done your way|and even then you don't Iike it.
{60363}{60425}When I came here,|I was a very enthusiastic girl.
{60427}{60460}Now Iook at me.
{60462}{60558}One of these days, I might find out|that I don't have to work at all...
{60560}{60632}and then I'II really tell you|what I think of you.
{60634}{60687}I have to get another blank.
{60716}{60810}Mr. Larkin, I don't Iike you.
{60915}{60976}Could I have a new blank, please?
{60985}{61058}-Don't feel so badly, dear.|-I can't help it.
{61063}{61111}We'II never finish here tonight...
{61113}{61185}and I'm going to miss|the most important engagement ever.
{61187}{61240}Maybe we'II finish in time.
{61266}{61323}Is that clock right?
{61354}{61461}-Yes, dear, it is.|-I'm never gonna make it.
{61483}{61534}Couldn't you telephone|the young gentleman?
{61536}{61621}I can't. I don't even know his number.
{61658}{61726}Yes. Thanks.
{61727}{61784}I have an engagement.|I'd Iike to get out of here.
{61786}{61824}So would I.
{61867}{61928}-Yes?|-Would you hold the Iadder, please?
{61997}{62061}You might count that music|while you're at it, too.
{62063}{62143}-AII right.|-The Iadder!
{62144}{62179}AII right. Sure.
{62398}{62462}It's almost 8:00.
{62486}{62515}Is it?
{62549}{62666}-Is it too Iate for us to have that dinner?|-What about your friend?
{62750}{62820}I just made him up.
{62876}{62964}No, I know. You are just being kind to me.
{62985}{63071}You are a very handsome woman,|a very attractive woman.
{63073}{63099}Now, Otto.
{63100}{63207}I should have known|you couldn't care for an old fool Iike me.
{63239}{63315}-Why, Otto....|-I know.
{63333}{63436}I am not worthy of you,|but I always hoped...
{63437}{63545}when I became a famous violinist,|then, maybe....
{63567}{63686}But to find out suddenly|that there is someone else....
{63749}{63862}Listen to me. There isn't anybody else.
{63892}{63989}-No?|-Really. I made him up.
{64004}{64044}You made him up?
{64438}{64492}I'II go and get your things.
{64584}{64685}Children, what are you doing here so Iate?|Go home, all of you.
{64834}{64927}-Hurry, please.|-Yes, dear. I'II be there in just a minute.
{64966}{65001}Oh, dear.
{65014}{65102}-Will you help me with this, please?|-I really shouldn't be helping you.
{65104}{65187}After all, having dinner in a public place|with a strange man.
{65203}{65268}He isn't a strange man.|I know all about him.
{65270}{65319}After all, we're practically engaged.
{65321}{65378}Just the same,|you have never been introduced.
{65379}{65470}That's convention.|A silly convention for ordinary people.
{65472}{65542}This is different. It's just Iike he said:
{65551}{65618}"You can't keep a Iove Iike ours|in an envelope."
{65620}{65696}And you know,|I know just what he'II Iook Iike.
{65701}{65817}He'II be tall, and dark,|and terribly handsome...
{65866}{65906}and sort of sad.
{65961}{66065}-Don't Iook so sad.|-To tell you the truth, I don't feel so good.
{66071}{66102}Look out for the carnation.
{66104}{66159}It's 8:15. You don't have time to feel bad.
{66161}{66205}-Where's the buttonhook?|-On that desk.
{66207}{66258}I don't think I should go.
{66287}{66331}For her sake, I mean.
{66333}{66386}I've told this girl|what an important man I am.
{66388}{66441}When she sees me,|it's gonna be an awful shock.
{66443}{66505}Don't you worry,|it's going to be Iove at first sight.
{66506}{66577}On the other hand, what about me?|Suppose I don't Iike her?
{66579}{66676}You don't know how Iucky you are.|Most men fall for a pretty face.
{66677}{66728}Then they find out|there's nothing behind it.
{66730}{66831}-But you know what's behind it.|-But what's in front of it?
{66833}{66937}-She'II be beautiful, you'II see.|-I wish I'd never Iearned to read or write.
{67236}{67331}-Good Iuck.|-Wait a minute. You Iook, I'm afraid to.
{67336}{67378}-No.|-Go on.
{67380}{67413}AII right.
{67542}{67595}-You see anything?|-Not yet.
{67610}{67652}-There's a beautiful girl.|-Yeah?
{67654}{67707}Very beautiful, but no book.
{67761}{67852}I think I see her right there.|A book and a carnation.
{67874}{67949}I can't see her face.|She's sitting behind the clothes rack.
{67951}{68022}She's Ieaning forward now.
{68059}{68120}-Can you see her?|-Yes.
{68140}{68200}-Is she pretty?|-Very pretty.
{68210}{68236}Really?
{68238}{68335}I would say she has something|of the coloring of Miss Fisher.
{68364}{68415}Miss Fisher? At the store?
{68417}{68487}You must admit that|Miss Fisher's a very good-Iooking girl.
{68489}{68551}Personally, I've always rather Iiked her.
{68553}{68607}This is no time to be talking|about Miss Fisher.
{68609}{68676}I can tell you right now,|if you don't Iike Miss Fisher...
{68678}{68711}you won't Iike this girl.
{68713}{68786}-Why? What do you mean?|-Because it is Miss Fisher.
{68788}{68815}What?
{68989}{69088}Of all the people in the world, that one.|The nerve of her!
{69090}{69160}PIease, you can't just walk off|and Ieave her sitting there.
{69162}{69186}What do you mean, I can't?
{69188}{69266}If she was the Iast woman on earth|and we were on a desert island...
{69267}{69309}I'd still walk off and Ieave her there.
{69311}{69400}Wait a minute. Remember,|she wrote you all those Ietters?
{69412}{69501}I don't believe it.|She couldn't and even if she did....
{69539}{69573}Good night.
{70208}{70252}I'II be right back.
{70334}{70404}-I thought you weren't coming in tonight.|-I was on my way--
{70406}{70477}But I'm so glad you did.|I have such wonderful news for you.
{70479}{70559}They accepted my application,|and I'm auditioning on Friday night.
{70561}{70621}-That's wonderful, Louise.|-You'II come, won't you?
{70623}{70693}-Sure. I'II be there.|-You've got to come.
{70720}{70766}-What?|-You're not ill, are you?
{70767}{70850}-No.|-It's just that you Iook a Iittle strange.
{70852}{70927}-No, I feel fine.|-AII right, then.
{70929}{70995}-Keep your fingers crossed. Bye.|-Bye.
{71670}{71771}-Excuse me, miss, could I have this chair?|-No, please.
{71780}{71838}I'm waiting for someone.|He'II be here any minute.
{71840}{71890}He must be special for you|to wait this Iong.
{71892}{71961}He is very special. Just Ieave it here.
{71963}{72009}-Thank you.|-Thank you.
{72995}{73060}What a coincidence.|I had an appointment here, too.
{73062}{73140}-Did you see Rudy Hansen?|-No, I haven't.
{73148}{73239}-Do you mind if I sit and wait for him?|-No, please don't.
{73250}{73347}-I have an appointment myself.|-Yes, I remember.
{73357}{73443}-Your friend seems to be a Iittle Iate.|-He'II be here.
{73500}{73568}I see you're reading EIizabeth Browning.
{73631}{73709}Yes. Any objections?
{73725}{73778}No. It just seems to me quite a surprise.
{73779}{73859}-Wait--|-I didn't know you Iiked classical poetry.
{73896}{73982}-There are a great many things--|-People are watching.
{73984}{74053}There are a great many things|that you don't know about me.
{74055}{74085}-Really?|-Yes.
{74086}{74164}Tell me, have you ever read|Emerson's essays?
{74212}{74260}-No, I haven't.|-I have.
{74263}{74351}And there are a great many things|you don't know about me.
{74353}{74399}It's such a pity that people so seldom...
{74401}{74487}go to the trouble of scratching|the surface to find out the inner truth.
{74488}{74548}I wouldn't care to scratch your surface...
{74549}{74664}because I know that underneath I'd find,|instead of a heart, a piccolo.
{74670}{74770}Instead of a soul, I'd find a flute,|and instead of an intellect...
{74772}{74847}I'd find a metronome|that doesn't work very well.
{74849}{74899}-That's very well put.|-Thank you.
{74901}{74943}-A metronome?|-Yes.
{74955}{75043}It's such an interesting miXture|of poetry and meanness.
{75057}{75106}-Very well put.|-Meanness?
{75110}{75152}Don't misunderstand me.
{75154}{75253}I think you understood me|when I said I was waiting for someone.
{75266}{75312}If your party doesn't show up--
{75313}{75381}Don't worry about my party showing up.|He'II show up.
{75383}{75460}In the meantime, you needn't bother|to stay here and entertain me.
{75462}{75498}As you wish.
{75876}{75965}-Have you read Crime and Punishment?|-Are you still here?
{75990}{76072}Are you deliberately trying|to ruin my evening?
{76074}{76108}No.
{76158}{76264}Do you hear what they're playing?|You know what that song reminds me of?
{76266}{76329}Yes, 99 harps.
{76357}{76392}Wrong again.
{76402}{76469}It reminds me of a girl|who was Iooking for a job.
{76471}{76569}-A very nice girl, I thought.|-How you can Iie.
{76577}{76638}That was before you began|to make fun of me...
{76640}{76702}giving imitations of me in the Iocker room.
{76704}{76788}And I'd Iike to tell you now|that I am not bowlegged.
{76793}{76836}-You're not?|-No.
{76838}{76905}-I have information to the contrary.|-It's a Iie.
{76907}{76993}If you think I'm bowlegged,|come out to the sidewalk and I'II prove it.
{76994}{77049}-I'II pull up my trousers.|-What?
{77051}{77112}And another thing,|you may have beautiful thoughts...
{77114}{77201}but you certainly hide them.|You're cold and snippy Iike an old maid.
{77203}{77252}If you don't watch out,|that's what you'II be.
{77254}{77309}-I? An old maid?|-Yes.
{77310}{77373}As you go on, you get funnier and funnier.
{77375}{77490}I've got some Ietters I could show you,|written by a man so far superior...
{77492}{77564}that it's ridiculous.|They'd really open your eyes.
{77566}{77624}-I, an old maid?|-Yes.
{77626}{77743}-You belittling counter-jumper!|-Counter-jumper? Well!
{77761}{77834}Thank you and good night,|EIizabeth Browning.
{78845}{78896}Tell me, what was he Iike?
{78930}{78994}-I never saw him.|-What?
{79016}{79091}That Mr. Larkin came in|and sat at my table.
{79116}{79225}He wouldn't Ieave.|He just talked until it was so Iate that....
{79292}{79390}When I Ieft I found this Iying outside|in the snow.
{79443}{79511}He must have seen us|through the window.
{79545}{79619}He must have seen us together|and thought....
{79621}{79695}You can write to him. You can eXplain.
{79763}{79814}I can never explain this.
{79836}{79884}He'd never understand.
{79921}{79956}Good night.
{79989}{80026}He'II never understand.
{80414}{80445}Hello.
{80447}{80513}Miss Fisher's aunt just telephoned|to say she's ill.
{80515}{80582}-She won't be in today.|-I think we'II Iive through it.
{80584}{80653}I don't understand you.|How can you be so mean to her?
{80655}{80739}Last night, she was waiting for you,|and you wouldn't go in to see her.
{80741}{80795}You walked away|and Ieft her sitting there alone.
{80797}{80881}-That's enough to upset any girl.|-Don't talk to me about her.
{80883}{80917}You don't know her Iike I do.
{80919}{80977}The Ieast you could do is to telephone her.
{80979}{81056}If there's any telephoning to be done,|she can call me.
{81058}{81123}I don't understand. It's so silly.
{81142}{81192}Too ill to come in.
{81310}{81373}-Is that you, Aunt Addie?|-Yes, dear.
{81440}{81560}-Was there a Ietter for me?|-After all, he hasn't had time.
{81606}{81670}I'II never hear from him again.
{81672}{81761}Now, Veronica, maybe he was called|out of town on business...
{81763}{81824}or maybe his mother was sick.
{81834}{81878}I wish I were dead.
{81909}{81987}There's another mail in an hour.|I'II try again.
{82025}{82097}-Maybe that's the young man now.|-No, it couldn't be.
{82099}{82187}He doesn't know my number,|he doesn't even know my name.
{82339}{82408}Hello. Who is it?
{82461}{82507}Just a moment, please.
{82531}{82605}It's Mr. Larkin from the store.|Will you speak to him?
{82607}{82727}No. I don't wanna talk to him.|Tell him anything.
{82740}{82839}I'm sorry. She isn't feeling very well.
{82850}{82943}I hope it's nothing serious. That's good.
{82949}{83043}Tell her we miss her.|What I mean is, she's a good worker.
{83051}{83088}She's a very good worker...
{83090}{83201}and what with Christmas coming on,|we can't afford to Iose a good worker.
{83211}{83312}Tell her I might drop by on my Iunch hour,|just to see how she is.
{83335}{83363}AII right.
{83635}{83693}-Good morning.|-It's you.
{83695}{83768}-Might I come in?|-AII right.
{83809}{83897}I'm sorry to come to the door Iike this,|but my aunt isn't home.
{83899}{84003}I hope you'II forgive the intrusion.|This is really a business call.
{84036}{84131}-Won't you come in?|-I felt that being in charge, I ought to....
{84134}{84226}-Check up on me?|-No, I didn't say that.
{84227}{84337}I just wanted to.... How are you?
{84414}{84490}I'II get over it someday, I suppose.
{84533}{84581}Have you seen a doctor?
{84600}{84634}No.
{84649}{84706}I don't need a doctor, you see.
{84729}{84806}My trouble is|what you might call psychological.
{84837}{84908}-If it's only psychological--|-Only psychological!
{84910}{84950}What I mean is...
{84961}{85055}Mr. Oberkugen is giving a party|tomorrow night at the Vienna Gardens...
{85057}{85161}and if you came to that, it might help you.|Psychologically, I mean.
{85163}{85201}-A party?|-Yes.
{85217}{85264}-At a beer garden?|-Yes.
{85315}{85377}It's obvious...
{85388}{85466}that you just have|no understanding of women.
{85495}{85545}It's really an engagement party.
{85547}{85613}Nellie and Mr. Oberkugen|are gonna be married.
{85622}{85686}He's taking over the hall|for the entire evening.
{85688}{85783}It's amazing. After 20 years,|Nellie has finally decided to--
{85795}{85883}No, I'II go. I'II answer the door.|You stay right there.
{85940}{86002}Mama had to run to catch a trolley|to go to the market.
{86004}{86112}She asked if Miss Addie'd mind the baby|for her? I got to take my music Iesson.
{86133}{86223}-Just in case. Bye.|-Bye.
{86359}{86440}-You've got a visitor.|-It's Jerome. Here, I'II take him.
{86442}{86503}No, you go sit down. I know how to do it.
{86505}{86581}Left hand supporting the back,|and the right supporting the body.
{86583}{86665}That's very good, yes,|but you better give him to me anyway.
{86683}{86730}Goodness gracious.
{86732}{86811}-How did you Iearn so much about babies?|-I've had dozens of them.
{86813}{86868}-What?|-I mean, my sister has.
{86880}{86980}There's nothing you can tell me|about babies that I don't already know.
{86982}{87062}I'm particularly eXpert|at getting that bubble up.
{87134}{87210}-By the way, whose is he?|-That's his mother in there.
{87262}{87329}-What?|-I mean, that's his mother's dummy.
{87331}{87387}My aunt makes clothes for her.
{87434}{87537}Easy to see where he gets his Iooks from.|Don't Iet him get too warm.
{87539}{87593}-I won't. I'II take this off.|-Support the back.
{87595}{87677}I will. I'm fine.|I've taken care of him for months.
{87685}{87782}-Does your sister Iive here?|-No, Wichita. I came from Wichita.
{87783}{87839}You must miss them.|Those bubbles, I mean.
{87841}{87912}Yes, I do. They're good kids.
{87914}{87987}-One of them was named for me.|-Which one?
{88014}{88103}-Andrew.|-I didn't mean the name, I mean the age.
{88141}{88238}He's 17 months, three weeks|and two.... No, one day.
{88245}{88329}-He was born on my birthday.|-Really? When is your birthday?
{88331}{88369}-Support the back.|-He's all right.
{88371}{88442}-June 30.|-The Crab.
{88462}{88507}-What?|-I mean, astrologically speaking.
{88509}{88563}I'm interested in birth signs.
{88605}{88713}There's nothing I can do about that now.|What sign were you born under?
{88723}{88829}-December. The Goat.|-The Goat? And the Crab?
{88831}{88900}-Yes.|-No wonder we battle so much.
{88944}{89008}-You know what I wish?|-What?
{89066}{89107}Here, you take him.
{89109}{89193}Now hold his back and his head,|and be very careful.
{89195}{89232}I know. I've done this before.
{89249}{89309}-I've got it!|-How wonderful.
{89329}{89416}This is Mr. Larkin from the store.
{89418}{89487}How do you do?
{89488}{89553}This isn't a social call.
{89568}{89677}-We mustn't keep you from your Iunch.|-I've got plenty of time, really.
{89682}{89747}-Let me have Jerome.|-AII right.
{89750}{89807}-I'II get some tea.|-Good. Fine.
{89861}{89920}-Go ahead, read your Ietter.|-Do you mind?
{89922}{89975}-No, not at all.|-Thank you.
{90355}{90426}-Good news?|-Very good news.
{90436}{90475}I'II be back to work tomorrow.
{90477}{90548}And besides,|I'II even go to the party tomorrow night.
{90549}{90637}No! Isn't it amazing|what one Ietter can do?
{90663}{90752}At this moment, I feel so good|I could even forgive you.
{90756}{90792}Forgive me? For what?
{90794}{90856}-You spoiled my date Iast night.|-I did?
{90858}{90942}Yes. This young man came along,|Iooked through the restaurant window...
{90944}{91020}saw you sitting at my table,|and he misunderstood it.
{91022}{91095}-He thought that you and I were....|-Yes.
{91102}{91213}He says here, "Tell me truthfully,|who was that attractive young man?
{91236}{91299}"He's just the type women fall for."
{91344}{91408}He's certainly got a sense of humor.
{91492}{91547}He sounds Iike|a strange sort of a fellow to me.
{91549}{91657}Imagine being afraid to go to a table|because another man was sitting there.
{91659}{91760}He wasn't afraid.|He was just being tactful and sensitive.
{91775}{91829}You see, it's very hard...
{91831}{91906}to explain a man Iike him|to a man Iike you.
{91909}{91934}Why?
{91936}{92010}Where you would say white,|he would say black.
{92012}{92095}Where you would say "old maid," he'd say:
{92140}{92238}"eyes that sparkle with fire and mystery."
{92337}{92426}-What else?|-"Vivacious, fascinating...."
{92466}{92502}There are a Iot of things.
{92504}{92574}If you'II forgive me,|I have to answer this immediately.
{92576}{92691}I wouldn't stop you for the world.|I'II run along and I'II see you tomorrow.
{92692}{92750}-AII right. Goodbye.|-Goodbye.
{92883}{92965}Why don't you ask your friend|to come to the party?
{92974}{93025}-Maybe I will.|-Bye.
{93192}{93268}Dear Friend....
{93315}{93391}Look at it flash.|It Iooks just Iike a rainbow.
{93407}{93514}Aren't you pleased?|I should think you'd be so happy.
{93522}{93626}Indeed I am. He wanted me|to have it in time for the party tonight.
{93634}{93718}Someday I'm going to have one|just Iike that.
{93730}{93794}Why, of course you will, dear.|You deserve it.
{93796}{93883}Why don't you Iadies run along?|You'II be Iate for the party.
{93884}{93990}-I'II take care of the cash boX.|-That's very nice of you. Thank you.

{94289}{94358}-I'II call for you at 8:00.|-Fine.
{94360}{94407}What about your friend?
{94443}{94515}-Isn't he coming along?|-No.
{94540}{94634}He prefers to have me all to himself.
{94658}{94699}I don't blame him.
{94778}{94818}Why, Mr. Larkin....
{94855}{94966}If you're really in Iove with a girl,|you don't take her to a big party.
{94979}{95041}You take her somewhere|where there's music...
{95043}{95111}get a Iittle table, just the two of you.
{95156}{95227}-Yes?|-I know just the place.
{95301}{95331}You do?
{95370}{95450}I'II tell your friend about it|if I ever meet him.
{95526}{95614}Thank you very much.
{95671}{95709}Here you are.
{95744}{95775}Thanks.
{95792}{95882}-When are you going to break it to her?|-As soon as I get a raise.
{95897}{95960}-Yes, sir?|-Come in before you Ieave.
{95995}{96112}If you want a raise, now's your chance.|You'II never find him in a better mood.
{96113}{96157}-Wish me Iuck.|-I do.
{96249}{96282}Thank you.
{96388}{96473}Sit down. I want to talk with you.
{96537}{96626}Each day I have given you|a Iittle more responsibility...
{96641}{96721}and each day you have proved|more worthy of my trust.
{96723}{96763}I've tried to do my best.
{96765}{96872}But I have never really eXpressed|my appreciation in any tangible way.
{96877}{96920}I wouldn't say that, sir.
{96922}{97008}Now I'm going to show you|how much faith I have in you.
{97018}{97057}Thank you, sir.
{97094}{97178}I am going to Iet you|carry my violin for me tonight.
{97236}{97306}-What?|-It is to be a surprise for Nellie.
{97308}{97402}-But, Mr. Oberkugen--|-I'm going to play it for her...
{97410}{97468}but I cannot carry it myself...
{97478}{97560}-or she will be, as you say....|-Wised up.
{97569}{97673}She shouldn't be wised up.|So you will take it for me, you know?
{97685}{97782}And then at the proper time,|you will ask me to play...
{97798}{97861}and I will say, "But I have no fiddle."
{97863}{97983}And you will say, "Why, I just happen|to have one with me." Good?
{97994}{98089}No, I couldn't possibly.|It's too much of a responsibility.
{98093}{98143}A Stradivarius is worth|thousands of dollars.
{98145}{98199}I know. I can say to you, "I trust you."
{98201}{98275}-No, really.|-No, not another word.
{98276}{98348}Take care of it and guard it with your Iife.
{98350}{98402}-Yes, sir.|-Goodbye.

{98809}{98838}No.
{98884}{98947}He isn't going to play|for all those people tonight?
{98949}{98978}I'm afraid so.
{98980}{99071}You can't Iet him make a fool of himself.|You've got to do something.
{99073}{99105}Anything.
{99159}{99188}Ready?

{117272}{117339}Why, it's very gracious of you.
{117348}{117441}Very well. Unfortunately, I have no fiddle.
{117456}{117560}I have a very beautiful Stradivarius,|but I didn't bring it...
{117562}{117611}and so I have no fiddle.
{117669}{117706}That's funny.
{117707}{117787}I just happen to have|a Stradivarius here with me.
{117819}{117927}In that case, I will play a Iittle number|which is a favorite of mine.
{118563}{118595}Come on.

{118801}{118867}-Don't worry. He'II be all right.|-Good.
{118869}{118914}Come on. You've got to help me explain.
{118916}{118990}He's fired, through!|Don't ever Iet me see him again!
{119015}{119104}-Don't bother, I heard him.|-I'm so sorry.

{119400}{119502}-My Stradivarius.|-I'm sorry, Uncle Otto.
{119504}{119573}I am no Ionger your uncle. Leave me alone.
{119575}{119621}I just wanted to say--
{119639}{119696}-You are fired.|-Wait a minute.
{119701}{119774}Andrew didn't do anything.|He didn't break your violin.
{119775}{119855}-He hasn't done anything.|-I gave him the violin to carry.
{119857}{119960}I told him to guard it with his Iife.|Now I have no violin.
{119962}{120026}-I want to tell you--|-There is nothing you can tell me.
{120028}{120101}-Get out of my sight.|-PIease Iisten to what he has to say.
{120103}{120197}I only wanted to say|that it was not your violin that broke.
{120203}{120272}-Not my violin?|-Isn't that wonderful?
{120274}{120352}Your violin is safe.|I'II have it back for you within an hour.
{120354}{120406}Wait a minute. What is back?
{120408}{120477}I Ioaned it to somebody at Symphony Hall.|I'II get it now.
{120479}{120562}My priceless violin, he Ioaned it!
{120564}{120652}-Wait a minute.|-I call the police.
{120654}{120691}No, wait.
{124124}{124187}I'm so glad that's over, aren't you?
{124303}{124381}-You were wonderful.|-Do you really think so?
{124383}{124459}-Yes. You won it hands down.|-I hope so.
{124574}{124638}-Isn't that Mr. Oberkugen?|-Yes.
{124647}{124700}Come on. We must thank him.
{124787}{124895}I just can't begin to thank you enough|for your kindness.
{124896}{124971}When Andy brought the violin home,|I could hardly believe--
{124973}{125050}I beg your pardon, Miss Parkson.|The judges wish to speak to you.
{125051}{125094}Yes, I'II be right there.

{125167}{125207}-EXcuse me.|-Yes.
{125240}{125319}Sorry. She thought you sent it|and I didn't have the heart to tell her.
{125321}{125389}Want me to take him in? It's up to you.
{125425}{125463}Not necessary.
{125482}{125521}Thank you, sir.

{126951}{127032}I never knew before Iast night, Mr. Hickey,|that you were an acrobat.
{127034}{127119}You didn't hear. The violin that broke|wasn't Mr. Oberkugen's.
{127121}{127201}It wasn't?|I thought it was too good to be true.
{127203}{127262}-Whose was it?|-It belonged...
{127293}{127355}to a Iady friend of Mr. Larkin's.
{127358}{127403}Here's Mr. Oberkugen.

{129392}{129471}I didn't think you'd be here|so early this morning.
{129473}{129546}I had a picture of you all|standing out there freezing...

{130818}{130914}I know that we didn't get along very well.
{130953}{131005}I guess we fought a Iot...
{131057}{131135}but Iosing your job|just before the holidays...
{131141}{131247}-that's something I wouldn't wish on....|-Your own worst enemy. I know.
{131273}{131316}I didn't say that.
{131359}{131421}Let's not quarrel anymore.
{131500}{131531}Goodbye.
{131617}{131648}Goodbye.
{131690}{131755}-Good Iuck.|-Thanks.
{131810}{131847}Here you are.
{131892}{131940}-A month's pay.|-Thanks.
{132016}{132121}-And goodbye.|-This is all my fault. I'm going to tell him.
{132123}{132215}You're going to do nothing of the sort.|I wouldn't Iet you.
{132225}{132304}At Ieast I can get you|a Ietter of recommendation.
{132306}{132388}-I don't think he'd--|-You knock on his door in a Iittle while.
{132390}{132435}I'II have it for you.
{132463}{132497}AII right.
{132547}{132585}Andrew's here.
{132602}{132726}I gave him his money but it'II be hard|for him to get another job without a Ietter.
{132727}{132802}Very well. To whom it may concern...
{132832}{132922}I wish to state|that Mr. Andrew Delby Larkin...
{132935}{132985}has been with me for....
{132987}{133050}-For a number of years?|-For a number of years.
{133052}{133123}In all this time I've found him....
{133165}{133245}-Reliable?|-Reliable, efficient....
{133265}{133386}Wait, you said "reliable"? He isn't reliable.|Taking my violin? Reliable?
{133407}{133476}-No, it isn't.|-It isn't honest, it isn't right.
{133478}{133538}I could have had him|thrown into jail for that.
{133540}{133578}Yes, you could.
{133613}{133668}I.... Where was I?
{133704}{133781}"In all this time|I have found him reliable...."
{133783}{133818}Efficient...
{133852}{133896}eXtremely honest...
{133929}{134017}and because of his diligence,|I promoted him.
{134049}{134087}I promoted him.
{134115}{134161}I was so proud of him.
{134175}{134250}Like a son he was to me.
{134297}{134366}-There's Andrew for his Ietter.|-Come in.
{134488}{134526}Morning, sir.
{134535}{134587}I will finish in a moment.
{134596}{134631}Where was I?
{134652}{134728}"Because of his diligence,|I promoted him...."
{134756}{134843}To the position of top salesman.
{134874}{134966}Yes, and that was not all.|I was going to make you manager.
{135020}{135055}When Nellie and I were married...
{135056}{135132}I was going to put you|in charge of the store.
{135160}{135218}Then you have to do this to me.
{135245}{135315}I'm sorry, sir.|There's nothing I can say now.
{135317}{135366}Otto, Iet's forget it.
{135380}{135446}Andy's Ieaving, and you have your violin.
{135448}{135530}That's the trouble. I haven't my violin.
{135616}{135720}Last night, for the first time|I heard it played as it should be played.
{135722}{135794}I knew then I had no right to it.
{135916}{135998}I want you to give it|to your young Iady friend.
{136009}{136103}Give it to her with my blessing.|Take it tonight...
{136146}{136186}after you finish work.
{136277}{136346}And now that you are manager...
{136391}{136449}you might give yourself a raise.
{136505}{136594}You see?|Sometimes I can admit I am wrong.
{136790}{136833}Get going, manager.
{136888}{136951}Mr. Hickey and Mr. Hansen! On your toes!
{136953}{137022}As your new manager,|I ask for a Iittle more holiday spirit.
{137024}{137085}-You're manager?|-Congratulations.
{137087}{137118}-That's more Iike it.|-Thanks.
{137120}{137166}-Where's Miss Fisher?|-In the Iocker room.
{137168}{137211}Hickey, you open up.
{137213}{137290}We'II make this the biggest Christmas Eve|Oberkugen has ever had.
{137292}{137350}-Let's sell out the store.|-Good.
{137526}{137574}-What happened?|-What?
{137621}{137673}What are you talking about?
{137704}{137818}-I thought you were discharged.|-Oh, that. I was.
{137820}{137926}But Mr. Oberkugen changed his mind,|took me back, and made me manager.
{137980}{138016}-Congratulations.|-Thanks.
{138018}{138073}-You know, it means a Iot to me.|-It does?
{138075}{138184}Yes. A raise in salary, and who knows?|Maybe marriage.
{138356}{138456}You know, she's a very attractive girl.
{138487}{138511}I think so.
{138568}{138656}I was quite surprised to find|that you had a girl.
{138671}{138753}You mean you thought I couldn't get one,|is that it?
{138767}{138845}There you go,|putting words into my mouth again.
{138847}{138921}You're the most insufferable man|I've ever met.
{138923}{138993}-Now what have I done?|-You were bad enough as a salesman...
{138995}{139045}-but now that you're manager--|-What happened?
{139047}{139089}-I hurt my finger.|-I'm sorry.
{139091}{139141}I was happy when I came in this morning.
{139142}{139167}I was happy, too.
{139169}{139233}Because I wouldn't have to see you|day in and day out.
{139235}{139278}I can't stand it anymore.
{139280}{139321}-I'm Ieaving!|-Wait a minute.
{139323}{139391}You can't Ieave now,|just as I was about to....
{139412}{139441}What?
{139485}{139547}I mean, you can't walk out|the day before Christmas...
{139548}{139583}with the customers coming along.
{139585}{139699}You needn't worry. I'II finish out the day,|if that's what's bothering you.
{139702}{139815}But I give you notice, Mr. Manager.|I'm getting out of here tonight.
{140000}{140080}This Iady is interested in this song|and would Iike to hear it.
{140082}{140116}Certainly.
{140126}{140187}-I'II play it for you.|-Thank you.
{140316}{140397}-What is it? What's wrong?|-Everything.
{140400}{140487}-Didn't you tell her?|-No. It's all over. Forget it.
{140753}{140846}Merry Christmas
{140860}{140982}have a very, very merry Christmas
{141004}{141119}Dream about your heart's desire
{141138}{141190}Christmas Eve
{141192}{141280}when you retire
{141282}{141353}Santa Claus will stop
{141354}{141432}and I know he'll drop
{141434}{141498}Exactly what you wanted
{141500}{141579}from your chimney top
{141600}{141686}So be jolly
{141692}{141812}ha ve a holiday as gay as holly
{141829}{141949}May the ones you love be near you
{141958}{142081}with the laugh of friends to cheer you
{142101}{142177}When the church bells ring
{142179}{142253}Like the angels sing
{142254}{142377}And you hear the joyful hymn they chime
{142419}{142505}Hang a wish from me
{142513}{142618}on your Christmas tree
{142640}{142713}For a very merry
{142715}{142837}Christmas time
{143346}{143384}My children...
{143412}{143529}this Christmas Eve has been the biggest|in the history of Oberkugen's.
{143535}{143597}I want to show you my appreciation.
{143602}{143712}Miss Fisher, I hope this will be|the first of many Christmases with us.
{143715}{143792}-Thank you, but I--|-Mr. Hansen, please.
{143798}{143877}-You have done a fine job.|-Thank you.
{143879}{143963}There have been times|when I have been a Iittle cross...
{143965}{144029}but you know I didn't mean it.
{144036}{144075}Thanks, Uncle Otto.
{144077}{144140}-Now, Andrew.|-You've already made this...
{144142}{144187}a very happy Christmas for me.
{144189}{144236}That is for the manager.
{144237}{144301}Tell your young Iady she should take...
{144303}{144369}good care of my.... Of her Stradivarius.
{144385}{144436}-Nellie, come.|-Good night.
{144438}{144466}Good night.
{144468}{144532}Merry Christmas.
{144551}{144598}Merry Christmas to you.
{144889}{144947}I guess you won't need me|to help you Iock up.
{144949}{145004}You go on home to your family,|I'II close up.
{145006}{145044}-I'II see you tomorrow.|-Yeah.
{145046}{145110}-Good night, Miss Fisher.|-Good night, Mr. Hansen.
{145111}{145157}-I beg your pardon.|-Did you Iose something?
{145159}{145218}Yes. I Ieft my stocking cap.
{145271}{145297}What?
{145299}{145381}I hope you don't hold it against me,|my making up to Miss Fisher.
{145383}{145475}I didn't know until Iast night|that she's in Iove with you.
{145490}{145573}I thought I was doing all right,|but I guess the best man won.
{145574}{145624}-Coming, Hickey?|-Coming.
{145639}{145673}Good night.
{145923}{146010}I was wondering if you'd mind|giving this to Mr. Oberkugen.
{146012}{146116}Now that I'm not going to be here|any Ionger, I couldn't think of keeping it.
{146126}{146199}-You're sure you won't change your mind?|-No.
{146217}{146297}I was going to Ieave|in a few weeks anyway.
{146325}{146414}You're not the only one|who's getting married.
{146416}{146482}Really? When did this happen?
{146488}{146559}-Let me help you with those.|-Thank you.
{146583}{146617}When did this happen?
{146619}{146704}It hasn't happened yet.
{146706}{146788}-I see.|-Then, of course, he might not ask me.
{146827}{146885}-Then again....|-He might. Yes.
{146908}{146999}As a matter of fact,|I happen to know that it will happen.
{147099}{147127}What?
{147141}{147204}What do you mean you happen to know?
{147217}{147308}I might as well tell you.|He came to see me the other day.
{147339}{147384}-Who?|-Your fiancé.
{147386}{147444}I had a pretty uncomfortable time|with him.
{147445}{147509}He just didn't believe you|when you wrote and told him...
{147511}{147583}that I meant nothing to you. Imagine that.
{147658}{147724}I just can't get this through my head.
{147774}{147861}You mean that he came to see you?
{147863}{147938}Yes, that's right.|But you've got nothing to worry about...
{147940}{147986}because I straightened|the whole thing out.
{147988}{148062}In a Iittle while, you'II be Mrs. Newspickle.
{148177}{148234}That's his name, isn't it?|That's what he told me.
{148235}{148285}Yeah, Newspickle.
{148291}{148373}-He's a nice fellow. I congratulate you.|-Thank you.
{148375}{148419}You're a very Iucky girl.
{148421}{148529}Did you find that he was very attractive?
{148540}{148646}Yes, I thought so.|But don't try to change him.
{148663}{148728}Don't you go putting him on any diet.
{148777}{148873}-Would you say he was fat?|-I wouldn't, no.
{148879}{148993}Personally, I Iike that Iittle tummy of his.|It gives him a nice homey Iook.
{149005}{149093}After all, that's what you want|in a husband, isn't it?
{149099}{149142}Yeah, that's what I want.
{149217}{149280}And as for his being bald...
{149334}{149390}I don't think anyone would know it.
{149392}{149479}It's very clever the way he Iets|those few hairs at the back grow Iong...
{149481}{149541}and then combs it forward|over the top of his head...
{149543}{149599}coming down over his ears.|It's real genius.
{149618}{149678}-What?|-About his mind....
{149698}{149756}Didn't you find that he was...
{149763}{149842}very intelligent and witty--
{149844}{149891}No, not witty.
{149893}{149953}As a matter of fact,|I found him quite depressed.
{149955}{150056}But then, of course, you can't judge a man|when he's out of a job.
{150093}{150130}Out of a job?
{150167}{150200}Why, yes.
{150213}{150325}Why, he never said anything|about that to me.
{150360}{150417}As you say, he's very sensitive.
{150418}{150494}But he thinks you can both|Iive comfortably on what you make.
{150496}{150548}Did he ask you what I make?
{150555}{150629}After all, he is your fiancé.
{150640}{150697}He was a Iittle worried at first...
{150699}{150774}but I promised him|I'd try to get you a raise.
{150830}{150905}I think this is ridiculous, outrageous.
{150971}{151033}I wish you could read his Ietters...
{151035}{151146}and you'd find out that he has|such a Iofty point of view.
{151148}{151177}Lofty?
{151184}{151241}And now to find out|that he's so materialistic....
{151243}{151286}Materialistic, too?
{151294}{151388}I'm sorry. I hate to think|that I've spoiled your Christmas.
{151403}{151520}You haven't spoiled it.|I suppose I should be thanking you.
{151522}{151628}No, you don't have to do that.|But you know what I wish you would do?
{151635}{151705}I wish you'd send this Newspickle|about his business...
{151707}{151762}and concentrate on me instead.
{151764}{151835}I can't. You already have someone.
{151857}{151948}-No, not yet.|-Wait a minute. This is all wrong.
{151962}{152061}-After all, it is Christmas.|-I know, but....
{152082}{152124}I Iove you so.
{152187}{152273}PIease open Box 237|and take me out of my envelope.
{152501}{152541}"Dear Friend."
{152586}{152637}-You?|-Yes.
{152684}{152729}Are you disappointed?
{152787}{152874}Psychologically, I'm very confused...
{152913}{152978}but personally, I feel just wonderful.

GOOD NEWS
This story take you way, way back to another era - 1927.
That was the year they were dancing the Charleston -
The year Coolidge did not choose to run -
The year Will Rogers was elected mayor of Beverly Hills -
The year of "flaming you" -whe a girl was a flapper- and a boy was a sheik.
''T'' is for ''Tait'' College
T-A-l-T, Tait! Hooray!
''A'' is for ''A'' college
Where students never want to graduate
''I'' is for ''Intercollegiate''
Intercollegiate fame
''T'' is for the Tait ''Team''
It's such a great team
Tait's prowess on the field
Is known to fame
For athletically, there's no team
- Like the Tait football team
- Boom diddy bah, diddy bah, Tait
Tait's the team we're rooting for
The team we're rooting for
Tait's the team that's won before
That's always won before
Victory will soon be ours
Hear the mighty roar
For the champion team is
Tait! Tait! Tait!
'Tis good news
You're gonna do me good
Come right here to me, good news
- Good news, news
- Good news
You're what I've waited for
That's what I'm slaving for
Good news is so
- Good to me
- To me, to me, to me, to me
Bad news is no
Good to me
Goody, good good good
Good news, you're bound to do me good
Come right here to me, good news
Have you heard the good news?
Gonna be good news
Gotta have good news
So we're saying bye-bye, bad news
Hello! Goody, good news!
T-A-I-T, T-A-I-T, T-A-I-T
Tait! Hooray!
- Hi, Babe.
- Hi, gang.
- We're gonna watch football practice.
- No, thank you.
Hey, there's the dean.
- Wow, get a load of that!
- Who is it?
She's the new pledgee, Pat McClellan.
A transfer from the Black Briar Finishing School.
- And I do hope you'll like it here.
- I love it already, Dean Griswold.
You've been absolutely charmant.
- Goodbye, Miss McClellan.
- Au revoir!
- Hello, Babe.
- Hello, McClellan.
- Everybody, this is Pat McClellan.
- Hi, Pat.
Enchantée. Enchantée.
Hey, wait'll Tommy Marlowe gets a load of that!
- How men'll fall for a pretty face.
- You said it.
- Last chance to go to the field.
- Aw, football!
- What are we waiting for?
- Come on, let's go.
Fellows, I hate to say it, but that was a pretty nice practice. Thompson...
...watch your passing.
Zubrowski, nice broken field running.
Beef, I'll get to you later.
- What are you doing?
- I'm warming up.
- Can't hang up a cold uniform.
- Bobby, get your uniform off.
I never get to wear it. I like to keep it on till the last minute.
I even rub a little dirt on it just to convince myself I'm on the team.
- You'll get off the bench this year.
- I hope so.
All the girls want football heroes.
I guess that's about all.
You can go to the party tonight.
And you can stay out till 10:00.
Listen, you crybabies! You're not gonna be so social this year.
We're not running a mahjong society.
I want you all out for early practice.
And don't forget, this is just the beginning.
The first game's just a week off. Okay.
Good going. You're in the pink.
- You'll be better than last year.
- Thanks, I owe it all to Poochie.
- I made him work.
- We'll win every game...
...including against Colton.
- Don't say it.
Think it, but don't say it out loud!
The evil spirits don't like it.
You're lucky you're the best trainer here.
Tommy, you gotta stay away from the women this year.
Remember, you're a football player, not Rudolph Valentino.
Women won't interfere with how I play.
I can take them or leave them.
I wish another player could say the same.
- Beef.
- Yes, sir?
- Where were you today?
- Right here on the field.
Your delicate body may have been there, but that dumb head of yours...
...was off worrying about that flapper, Babe Doolittle.
You're right, coach. But I'll be all right, I'm studying psychology.
Psychology! It's black magic.
Leave it alone.
It teaches you to act natural. You shouldn't have repressed hostilities.
If you got something inside, you should let it come out.
So I want to announce right now...
...if anyone comes near
Babe Doolittle, I'll kill him!
- Wow! You tell 'em, Beef.
- That's love.
- Bobby, hurry up.
- Have you met the new bombshell yet?
The Phi Gamma Gamma,
Patricia McClellan.
She's burning up the campus.
Haven't you seen her?
- I let the gals come to see me.
- Tommy, how do you do it?
It's a cinch and it's a snap
They just fall in your lap
And, Bobby, you can make them
Do the same
Who, me? Never.
Don't be scared, don't be shy
Get that gleam in your eye
And then you'll have more girls
Than you can name
Wear collegiate, collegiate clothes
- Be a ladies' man
- I just look silly.
Get that swagger and get that pose
- Be a ladies' man
- I couldn't.
If you think you're much too skinny
With your six-inch waist
Don't just give up the fight in haste
Some girls have such peculiar taste
Be a ladies'
Be a ladies'
Learn to be a ladies' man
- And be collegiate
- Collegiate
- Collegiate
- Collegiate.
Walk collegiate, talk collegiate
- Be a ladies' man
- A rooty tooty
Get that swagger, get that pose
- Be a ladies' man
- A rooty toot
And when a ladies' man
Wears a certain tie
And that twinkle is in his eye
You can kiss your sweetie-pie goodbye
They love a ladies' man
- Oh, how I love the ladies
- Root toot-toot, rooty toot-toot-toot
Get that gleam, boy
Right in your eye
- I wanna be a ladies' man
- A rooty tooty
Root toot-tooty, toot-toot-toot-toot
Be a ladies' man
A rooty tooty
When they give you that frozen stare
Make believe that you just don't care
Then in no time they're in your hair
If you're a ladies' man
If you're a ladies' man
If you're a ladies' man
You gotta be up-to-date
You gotta know your stuff
If you want to rate
You gotta sing vo-do-de-o and boop-boop-a-doop
You gotta ukelele lady
Lika she lika you
You gotta do the Black Bottom
Gotta do the Shag
And the Charleston
And the Varsity Drag
Oh, how I love the ladies
Wear collegiate, collegiate clothes
We're so collegiate
Rather be a ladies'
Rather be a ladies'
Rather be a ladies' man
Swagger!
And strike a pose
Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be
Rooty toot-toot
To be a ladies' man
If you're a football star
A big shot or an also-ran
A guy whose clothes don't fit him
Or a Dapper Dan
Any man who is half a man
Has to be a ladies'
Gotta be a ladies'
Gonna be a ladies'
Gotta be a ladies'
Hope to be a ladies'
Gotta be a ladies'
- Gotta be a ladies' man
- The cat's pajamas
- Gotta be a ladies' man
- I'll pay you Tuesday
- Gotta be a ladies' man
- I really mean it
Gotta be a ladies' man
And I don't mean maybe
Got to be a ladies' man
If I do more of this, I won't have strength for the party.
Why do you need strength?
Beef's curfew is 10.
I'm through with football stars whose curfews are 10.
- My new passion is Bobby Turner.
- That skeleton?
He's about as appealing as a string bean. He's nothing.
Yeah, he's nothing.
He's on the scrub team.
He can stay out all night.
Oh, I'm mad about him.
- Does the lucky boy know about this?
- He will tonight.
Of all the nerve, she can't do this!
Where's Connie?
- Look at that thing. What is it?
- Pat McClellan's dress.
- Oh, gee.
- Wow!
She made me fix it.
I don't have to do that.
- I'm gonna tell Connie.
- Come on, she's in the kitchen.
- Connie!
- Here I am.
- What's the trouble?
- It's that Pat McClellan.
Connie, do you know what she asked me to do? Sew some beads on her dress.
Who does she think she is, Marie
Antoinette? Give me a wrench, Cora.
Maybe you can say something to her.
I don't know what I'd like to say.
Give me a rag, Cora.
- Here, let me look at that thing.
- Cora, give me a...
Holy smoke!
Is this the dress?
- What do you think of it?
- Isn't it the cat's?
Just out of the Ziegfeld Follies.
Where does it need fixing?
- It doesn't anymore. I fixed it.
- You didn't.
I already did it before
I remembered to get mad.
I'd better have a talk with her.
- What about the sink?
- It's fixed.
Don't have harsh words with her.
She's new and doesn't know.
You're right, Mrs. Drexel. After all, she is just out of finishing school.
You wonderful creature!
Why does everyone love you?
Why are you so divine...
...so clever, so popular?
I sure wish someone loved me the way you love you.
Why, Connie Lane. I was only fooling, n'est-ce pas?
It sounded like true love to me.
Here's that burlap bag.
How sweet of you to bring it up.
Merci, merci.
As long as you're living with us, there are a few things...
Why, of course. Naturally.
That dress, for instance. For a little sorority party, it's rather extreme.
- Extreme? Really?
- And obvious.
Obvious?
- It's Babe. Can we come in?
- Entrez.
Sure.
I hate to interrupt, but the sheiks will be here any minute.
- You'll slay them in that dress, Pat.
- They're all pretty impressionable.
- Have you met any of them?
- Not yet.
But I hope to meet all the worthwhile ones.
Well, let's see now. Which ones are really, really worthwhile?
Eddie Dunkelman. He's a catch.
His father's the local butcher.
He's a little short and a little fat, but he does a mean Charleston.
The boy for you is Tommy Marlowe.
We're all just crazy about him.
Tommy Marlowe? Who's he?
Only the captain of the football team.
And what a sheik.
You know, girls, I think college contacts are terribly important.
It's très nécessaire to find someone of the right background...
...and sufficient wealth...
...of culture.
Oh, that's so true.
Is 25 million dollars enough culture for you?
Peter Van Dyne, III has it.
Richest man at Tait.
- Van Dyne, III?
- Oh, but he's such a drip.
For 25 million dollars, let him drip.
He's not an attractive boy?
Attractive? He's the twerpiest wet smack of all time.
Quel fromage.
- What did you say?
- I said, ''Quel fromage.''
- ''What a pity'' in French.
- Oh, you must mean dommage.
Fromage means cheese.
Quel fromage. ''What cheese.''
Oh, of course, dommage.
How silly of me.
Come on, they're here.
- Is Bobby here?
- I'm not ready!
- You were saying about the dress?
- Oh, forget it Pat. I was wrong.
The dress suits you perfectly.
Nice party, Mrs. Drexel. But I want the team out of here by 10:00.
Of course, Mr. Pooch.
That's understood.
Gee, I love to dance. I feel like
I'm not even touching the floor.
You're not.
It's heaven with you in my arms.
Let's go out on the porch.
Let's dance.
- Do you love somebody else?
- Oh, no, Beef.
You just don't understand me. I'm like the psychology you talked about.
I'm a split personality.
Oh. Well, if anyone comes near you, they'll be a split personality.
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Oh, nothing.
Beef, look at poor Connie.
You've simply gotta help her.
Connie?
Beef's dying to help.
Give him something to do.
- Fine. Would you help me pass these?
- Sure.
- Well, Bobby, here I am.
- What?
- It's time for that dance I promised.
- Go away!
- Beef will kill whoever comes near you.
- Well, wouldn't it be worth it?
Hey, what's going on?
- Bobby, you and me are soul mates.
- What?
I won't take no for an answer.
Tell me you love me.
Look at that. Goose pimples.
Think it's cold? It's you.
Well, look at that. Goose pimples.
You think it's you?
It's Beef. Let me go!
There's nothing like a college education.
- Tommy, where've you been?
- Tommy!
Girls, girls, where is this gorgeous creature I've been hearing about?
Oh, McClellan isn't down yet.
Now, don't worry. I'll be back.
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hi, Evelyn.
What is this, the waiting room?
We can all go home now.
Marlowe is here.
Thanks. This is quite a turnout.
If this show's no good,
I want my money back.
I have a little announcement to make...
...you are about to witness Patricia
McClellan, the female form divine.
Jungle potentates have fought for one smile from her lips.
For only 10 cents, you will see this little lady descend these stairs...
...placing one dainty foot before the other. All right, watch...
Some of these boys you know, but I'd like to introduce you to a few more.
Patricia McClellan, Clyde Waters.
Richard Tripper...
...Eddie Dunkelman...
- And I'm Tommy Marlowe.
That was a charming speech,
Mr. Marlowe.
You've obviously spent most of your life in a freak show.
I was only kidding.
You're really terrific.
I'll tell you more while we dance.
- Shall we go on, Mrs. Drexel?
- Oh, yes. This is Grover Smith.
- And this is Peter Van Dyne, III.
- Van Dyne.
Mr. Van Dyne, III,
I've heard so much about you.
I believe my mother might have met your mother at Newport?
Well, that's very possible.
- Would you care to dance?
- Oh, I'd love to.
Kind of cold in here, isn't it?
- How does it feel to get the brush?
- How do you like her, Tommy?
She's not so hot. Just trying to play hard to get. Hey, Danny!
You're the first touch of refinement I've found here.
The first person I can really talk to.
That makes me very happy.
I'd like to make you
100 million times happier.
100 million! Oh, Peter!
You don't know what this means...
My lord, would you and the duchess like a moldy canapé?
Not very funny.
I'll try one first, in case you suspect poison.
- Not a bad idea.
- You're more at home in a freak show.
- You were saying...
- Van Dyne!
- Van Dyne.
- What is it?
Phone call, long distance. New York.
- What? Where, inside?
- No, at the dormitory.
I'd better scoot.
Pat, I'll only be a few minutes.
It'll seem like eons, my dear.
Oh, poor Peter.
I hope it isn't bad news.
Ten o'clock! Football team out of here, pronto! Everybody out.
Isn't that your cue? You've got something to do with football, right?
Are you kidding?
Why, I'm the captain of the team.
I don't get this. What's the matter?
I'm a popular guy.
Really?
- This year I'll be all-American.
- All-American?
Does that mean you become a citizen?
Come on, Pat. Don't be an iceberg.
You gotta melt someday.
Mr. Marlowe, haven't I made it clear to you that I don't like you?
I'll spin you into town tomorrow night.
Have dinner, go dancing, just us two.
I'll pick you up at 6. Okay?
- Quelle effronterie!
- Pat?
- My dear.
- Peter, what is it?
I phoned the dormitory.
There was no call for me at all.
No call?
Well, I think I'd better be going.
Don't forget about tomorrow night.
- I'm glad you could stay, Peter.
- So am I.
I knew when I came down those stairs, this was going to be my lucky night.
It's like fate.
It was accidental
We just met by chance
Yet I'm very certain
You will be my big romance
Football players bore me
All they've got is health
But, you, my sweet
Are joy complete
Because you've got such wealth
Of culture
Lucky in love
Lucky in love
What else matters
If you're lucky in love?
Good breaks are few
Few skies are blue
But bad luck scattered
When I first looked at you
I don't care
What the future will bring
If we're there together
I won't need a thing
I'll say I'm lucky in love
If you'll take me, that'll make me
Oh, so lucky in love
Lucky in love
Lucky in love
Don't you know when you are
Lucky in love?
You're just my speed
Why must I plead?
Oh, come to baby
In her hour of need
I don't care if you're puny and weak
And you've only got
Baby fuzz on your cheek
I love you!
Lucky in love
If you trust me then we must be
- Oh, so lucky in love
- In love
Lucky in love
- You're lucky if you're lucky in love
- You're lucky
- Lucky in love
- You're lucky
Lucky in love
Lucky in love
Lucky in love
What else matters
If you're lucky in love?
Good days are few
Few skies are blue
But bad luck scatters
Every time I'm with you
I don't mind if at poker, I'm green
If I stand ace high
With a beautiful queen
I'll say I'm lucky in love
If you'll take me, that'll make me
Oh, so lucky
So darn lucky
Lucky in love
Lucky in love
Guess I never will be
Lucky in love
Some girls are gay
Know what to say
But when I talk
I scare the fellows away
If my dream man
Should ever arrive
I can bet he won't
Even know I'm alive
Lucky in love
Must be fun to be someone who's
Oh, so lucky in love
In love, lucky in love
You're lucky if you're lucky in love
You're lucky in love
You're lucky in love
So lucky, lucky, lucky
If you're lucky in love
- You're lucky
- Got your head in a whirl
- You're lucky
- If you got the right girl
You're oh, so lucky
Lucky in love
Lucky in love
Up to now
I've been so lucky in love
Never was spurned
Never got burned
The cat's pajamas
Where the girls were concerned
But now I'm acting
Just like a dope
It's the first time some baby said
''It's no soap.''
And meant it!
Lucky in love
If you take me, that'll make...
- So it was you!
Of all the uncouth, contemptible tricks!
I just wanted a chance to get together.
Get together? I never want to see you again. You...
You're absolutely incorrigible!
- What's that?
- That's French.
Pal, that gal
Sure put you in your place
When she called you incorrigible
To your face
Oh, brother, you got a shove
And without that, we still doubt that
You'd be lucky in love
In love, lucky in love
You're lucky if you're lucky in love
You're lucky
So lucky
It's oh, so lovely
If you are
Lucky in love
- These are what you're looking for.
- That's fine, Miss Lane. Thanks.
Good night.
Why, Mr. Marlowe. What on earth are you doing here?
Well, why? Can't anyone come in here?
I thought you'd made a mistake. It's not the hangout for the football team.
What do you mean? I've often been here doing research.
Not in the past three years.
Why do you say that?
I work here, Mr. Marlowe.
I'm the assistant librarian.
In that case, I'll never lie again.
But how come you look so familiar?
Where have I seen you before?
You've seen me 100 times in the past three years.
You stood right next to me at the punch bowl last night.
My name is Connie Lane.
Babe's roommate! For crying out loud, then you're a student.
- Why do you want to work here?
- It helps pay my tuition.
It's called working your way through college.
Oh, I'm sorry.
At your service.
Where's the French dictionary?
I want to look up a word.
I'm majoring in languages.
What's the word?
Ever heard of a French word,
''in-courage-gee-bull''?
- You mean incorrigible.
- What does it mean?
Same thing it means in English.
''Impossible, incorrigible, past reforming.''
That's what I thought.
She spoke the word beautifully.
I heard it all the way in the kitchen.
I'll give her back that parlez-vous.
- Who's the best French teacher?
- Kennyon.
I'll sign up for a course.
Don't get carried away. Kennyon is tough, and he hates football players.
I've never flunked a subject yet.
Come on, show me a few words.
- Don't be silly. It's closing time.
- Come on.
Well, all right.
- The book, le livre
- Le livre, the book
- The pen, la plume
- La plume, the pen
- La chaise
- La chaise
- Le crayon
- Le crayon
- Le cahier
- Le cahier
- Le papier
- Le papier
Noir, rouge, blanc are black, red, white
- Rouge, blanc, noir
- You're fairly bright
- Now please go back
- I bet I get them right
Rouge, blanc, noir, le papier, le cahier
Le crayon, la chaise, la plume, le livre
Le livre est rouge
La chaise est noir
- Wonderful!
- This is work?
It's more like play
In no time flat
Je parle français
- Had enough?
- I'm just starting
All right, you asked for it
The door, la porte
La porte, the door
Of wood, du bois
Du bois, of wood
To open, ouvrir
Ouvrir, to open
To shut, fermer
Fermer, to shut
The pronouns that you need
Are je and vous
Je means me and vous means you
Now do them all
Just watch me plow right through
Je and vous, to shut, fermer, to open
Ouvrir, la porte, rouge, blanc et noir
Le papier, le cahier, le crayon
La chaise, la plume, le livre
J'ouvre la porte
Je ferme la porte
Marvelous!
My thirst to learn you can't quench
Come fill me up to here with French
- More?
- More
- You'll explode
- Who cares?
The hand, la main
La main, the hand
The mouth, la bouche
La bouche, the mouth
- Les yeux sont bleus
- They sure are blue
- Les cheveux
- The hair, les cheveux
The words for boy and girl
Garçon et fille
Garçon et fille
Are he and she
- Now from the top
- I'll get my French degree
Garçon et fille, les cheveux, the hair
Les yeux sont bleus, la bouche, la main
Je et vous, fermer, ouvrir, la porte
Rouge, blanc, noir, papier, cahier
Le crayon, la chaise, la plume, le livre
Mesdames! Messieurs!
Les yeux sont bleus
- You're crazy!
- Won't you come join me in a dance?
I am the president of France!
- Gee, this is fun.
- Yes, I know.
I didn't know learning could be fun.
Look at these books waiting to be read.
- Anybody can come in and read them.
- Yeah, no cover charge.
When I was a kid, I loved to read.
I wanted to find out about everything.
I thought I was the only kid who felt that way.
You too?
I wanted to find out about everybody in the world.
Don't bother with that now.
Come on.
There was a creek back home.
I used to take a canoe and...
...pretend that I was going to the countries I'd read about.
- Bread and butter.
- Bread and butter.
I was Huck Finn on the Mississippi, the Volga, the Nile, the Seine...
...all of them.
Sometimes at night, I'd sit there in my canoe and look up at the stars.
I'd look up at them from our rooftop in Chicago...
...and think of all the people all over the world looking up at the same stars.
Thinking about them in different languages.
Now the whole world just seems to be little Tait College.
I never think about anything but being a big football star.
That'll be over in a few months, and then what?
If you don't forget about that boy in the canoe, you'll be fine.
I think he has a great future.
You're quite a girl.
When I walked in here, I was feeling kind of sorry for you.
Why?
Oh, I don't know. Having to work your way through school and...
...missing a lot of good times.
Not having the best things in life.
The best things in life?
I've got them. Everybody has.
There are so many kinds of riches
And only one of them is gold
The wealth you miss
Remember this
Worthwhile things cannot
Be bought or sold
The moon belongs
To everyone
The best things in life
Are free
The stars belong
To everyone
They gleam there
For you and me
The flowers in spring
The robins that sing
The sunbeams that shine
They're yours
They're mine
And love can come
To everyone
The best things in life
Are free
Gee, I've learned a lot of things today.
La main, les yeux, la bouche.
- What does that mean in French?
- Embrasser.
Embrasser?
It's just as nice in both languages, isn't it?
Gee, what a vocabulary I've got.
Wait'll I spring this on Pat.
That'll put a dent in her.
Why don't you just hit her over the head with a hockey stick?
We'll review the use of the French pronoun...
...for the benefit of those who have come into the class late.
Il, he or it.
Elle, she or it.
Il est, he is.
Elle est, she is.
Ils, ''they,'' plural, masculine.
- Are you sure he's in this class?
- They'll be out any minute now.
Pooch, you gotta do something.
It's a downright case of French schizophrenia if I ever saw one.
Oh. Well, don't worry.
I'll see that he gets rid of all this bologna. Just leave it to Poochie.
Je t'aime.
- Je t'adore. Les yeux bleus...
- Good luck in the game tomorrow.
- The opening game!
- Oh, yeah.
- Tomorrow, remember?
- It's a cinch. It's in the bag.
Je t'aime.
It's in the bag, eh?
What's the matter?
You and your French course.
That's what. You're gonna flunk it.
Then where will our team be?
Aw, dry up, Poochie.
Je t'aime, je t'adore, les yeux bleus.
What's that?
This is my French speech.
I'm springing it on a Sheba.
I get it. It's that McClellan dame.
Tommy, have you gone nuts?
Yes!
The boys don't understand a word you're saying on the field.
They're waiting for the signals.
You give them the signals in French!
Sure. Quarante-et-un, dix-huit, soixante-neuf, onze. Hup!
I can't help it, Poochie.
Language comes easy to me.
I've been in the class five days, and I speak like a native.
- Not sure from where, but a native.
- Comes easy, huh?
You think your parlez-vous français will charm Crenshaw off the field?
I don't know, but it'll charm McClellan into going to the prom with me.
Poochie, vamoose.
I gotta study my speech.
Hey, Tommy!
My chauffeur!
She's at Gimpeldinger's having a soda with Van Dyne.
Keep the engine boiling.
I'll be right down.
Je t'adore, je t'aime.
Vous êtes merveilleux.
- Pooch, can I drop you someplace?
- Yeah, over the nearest cliff.
Anything wrong?
Things are so wrong, we may wind up using you on the team.
Well, what's wrong with that?
- Nothing, if you want to lose.
- Babe! Go away.
- Is that all you have to say?
- Leave me alone!
- How long have you been here?
- I hopped in by the soda shop.
I had an ice-cream cone and a glass of milk. By now it's a malted.
I'm trying to say I love you!
I told you, I won't have anything to do with you.
I value my life. I love life, and I want to live.
Sure, I like you. If circumstances were different, well...
...you and me, that might be how I'd like it to be...
To be or not to be, that is the question...
...where government of the people, for the people, give me liberty or give...
- Oh, hello, Beef.
- Who are you talking to?
- Nobody. I'm practicing a speech.
- I thought I saw you with someone.
- With somebody?
- Yeah, Babe.
How silly. Just us two, just jalopy and me and baby makes three.
- You sure she wasn't here?
- Posi-lutely, abso-tively.
- Turner, you don't like Babe, do you?
- Like her?
- Can't stand her, silly flapper.
- What do you mean, ''silly flapper''?
She's great! She's the bee's knees, the cat's meow and she loves you.
- What'd you say?
- I said, ''Oh, yeah.
She loves you. Yes, sir!''
I'm glad you said that. Otherwise
I might've done this...
- My fender!
- You know I get upset over Babe!
I'm highly tense. When you keep your inhibitions inside...
...they just break open!
I said, ''Ow!'' When you hurt this car, it's hurting me.
When I lose control, I get shaken up from bottom to top!
- You don't know how I suffer!
- Beef, not so loud. My car!
- Oh, is this your car?
- It was.
Sorry. When I get mad, I don't know what I'm doing, like I'm hypnotized.
Oh, that's all right.
- Give me a lift to Gimpeldinger's?
- Sure. Hop in.
No, no, in front!
Bobby, better take better care of your car. It's getting shabby.
No, no, in front!
All out for Gimpeldinger's!
Well, old place hasn't changed much.
Wonder if MclKinley's still president?
Bonjour, mesdames et messieurs.
J'ouvre la porte. Well!
Je ferme la porte.
Garçon, un split de banane, s'il vous plaît.
Coming up, Tommy.
Mes enfants...
...le français, c'est le langage de l'amour et de la guerre.
I drink à la most beautiful femme dans la chambre.
Elle knows who elle is.
Mademoiselle...
Beat it, Marlowe.
Mademoiselle, I have composed a speech just for you...
...in your own language.
Je t'aime, je t'adore.
Les mains blanches, les yeux bleus...
...les oreilles petites, les dents comme les perles, la bouche rouge.
Mademoiselle, que vous êtes belle.
Que vous êtes délicieuse.
Mon coeur s'ouvre à ta voix.
Le jour de gloire est arrivé.
Therefore, mademoiselle, after the game...
...I'd be honored if you'd accompany me to the prom.
Mr. Marlowe, you are a pain in the neck in any language.
I'm going to the prom with Mr. Van Dyne.
You may be able to memorize lines, but you can't memorize good manners.
Okay, Miss McClellan.
Maybe it took a ton of bricks to fall on me, but I guess I get the idea.
You win.
I won't take up any more of your valuable time.
You keep treating Tommy like that and he might lose the game for Tait.
I'm afraid Mr. Marlowe's career doesn't interest me.
Watch this. I'll get her interested.
Leave Pat alone, kids.
Just because he's our hero, she doesn't have to throw herself at him.
And I don't blame her.
After all, he'll be The Pickle King of
America after he's done with college.
- The what?
- Oh, didn't you know?
His father's the Marlowe Pickle Works.
How sordid. Pickles.
Yeah, 30 million dollars' worth.
Isn't it disgusting?
And still, poor Tommy has no one to go to the dance with.
All that dough, most popular guy in school, no date.
Maybe you're betting on the wrong horse.
- Mind your own business.
- Temper, temper.
A medicine man I met
Said, ''Don't get yourself in a sweat''
When things look gray
Just shrug and say
''It must have been something I 'et'''
''So don't get yourself
In a snit, ''he said
Tuck your tantrums
Into your kit instead
''It's disarming to be charming''
Quoth the medicine man
Whom all agree, it's plain to see
Nobody could be wiser than
So if your temper's
Getting the top hand
All you have to do is just stop and
Pass that peace pipe and
Bury that hatchet
Like the Choctaws, Chickasaws,
Chattahoochees, Chippewas do
If you're feeling mad as a wet hen
Mad as you can possibly get, then
Pass that peace pipe and
Bury that tomahawk
Like those Chichimecs,
Cherokees, Chapultepecs too
When you're cranky
Try to use a little restraint
Fold that hanky
And wipe off all of that war paint
But if you wanna be an all-right guy
Not a long-face,
Blues-in-the-night guy
Write that apology and dispatch it
When you've quarreled
It's grand to patch it
Pass that peace pipe and
Bury that hatchet
Like the Choctaws, Chickasaws,
Chattahoochees, Chippewas
And those Chichimecs,
Cherokees, Chapultepecs
And those Chicutemis,
Chapechets and Chicapees
Chochos, Changos, Chattanoogas,
Cheecharows do
Chocho!
Chango!
Chattanooga, Chippewa!
Chow, chow!
Choo, choo!
Chichimec, Chapultepec!
If you use a little control
You'll be top man on the totem pole
- Professor Kennyon!
- Oh, Miss Lane.
I was going to see you. I corrected the tests, I'll give them to you now.
Thank you. Yes, the elementary class. That was a fast job.
- Oh, excuse me...
- Well!
Gee, Connie! It's good to see you.
Oh, excuse me, professor.
Watch your step in more ways than one.
I've got your first exam here.
How did our football star do?
- A perfect paper. 100 percent.
- I did?
I'm surprised. Don't get careless.
You've got to tow the mark with me.
Football and studies don't mix.
Good day.
He's a pleasant old cuss.
Well, I've got to go to football practice.
Gee, I got a perfect paper.
You know why? It's all your work.
It's just a vocabulary test, mostly words you taught me that day.
Yes, I know.
It isn't half as much fun when Kennyon teaches it.
I never have the least impulse to kiss him.
Speaking of your impulses, how about Pat McClellan?
Are you making a dent on her with your French?
Oh, here, I'll take these.
Guess I should have used that hockey stick.
It doesn't matter anymore. I knew it the second I bumped into you.
I don't care. I don't care if I never see her again.
Will you go to the prom with me?
After she declined?
No, thanks.
But I'm glad she did, because now I can ask you.
Play second fiddle? No, thanks.
Guess I don't blame you.
- Well, who are you going to ask now?
- Nobody.
I'm not going stag.
Guess I won't go at all.
Not go to the prom?
But that's silly! It'll practically be in your honor.
I'll go if you'll go with me.
Well...
- All right.
- You will? Wonderful!
Eight o'clock.
I'm late for practice.
Good luck in the game.
Oh, they sure are blue.
Look at Connie.
Hi, Connie!
She's acting so strange.
Connie, hello!
Hello...
So I told her if that's what she...
Hello, Connie.
Miss Connie!
- The sink, it's acting up again.
- It is? How nice.
How do you like that?
- She must've gone crazy.
- Overwork.
She's having a breakdown, poor kid. I gotta do something!
Connie, are you all right?
- Babe, guess what?
- What?
I'm going to the prom tomorrow.
So that's it.
Wonderful! Who are you going with?
- You'll never guess.
- Then you better tell me.
Oh, I know it seems impossible, but...
...he likes me.
- Who?
Tommy.
- Tommy Marlowe.
- Tommy!
Connie, I think I ought to warn you. Pat...
Oh, Pat! He told me all about that.
- It's all over.
- Are you sure?
Oh, of course, I'm sure.
Don't spoil my fun, Babe.
- What should I wear?
- A suit of armor.
Just think, I'm going out with a football hero.
Yay, Marlowe! Come on, Marlowe!
Touchdown!
Tommy! Tommy!
Oh, I was so thrilled! You made a football fan out of me overnight.
Oh, Tommy, I was so mistaken about you.
But today, when I saw you on the field...
...I suddenly realized that maybe I was so rude to you...
...because I really liked you.
But I didn't want to like you as much as I could...
...if I really let myself.
Pat, this is crazy. It's wonderful!
I don't know what to say.
I know what to say.
Can I go with you to the prom tonight?
Can you? Oh, this is terrific!
Wait a minute.
What about Van Dyne?
He just doesn't matter.
Poor Peter, he's really so stuffy.
I should've known the minute you saw me play a game.
This is wonderful.
It's the greatest day of my life!
I win the opening game and you at the same time.
Mademoiselle...
...voulez-vous accompany moi à la prom ce soir?
Your French is beautiful.
Enchantée, monsieur, enchantée.
See you tonight, then.
Tonight.
Connais-tu le pays?
Connais-tu, connais-tu? Con...
Connie!
372-J, please.
So I said, ''Herbert, if you think
I'm one of those red-hot mamas...
...you're very badly mistaken.''
372-J, please.
That's right.
I said, ''You may think you're a sheik...
...but your harem has to do without me.
That is, unless you change your tune.''
372-J, please.
- Hey, Janet.
- Wait.
- Well, you certainly took long enough.
- It's all yours, June.
Georgia, look. I got an orchid!
- Look, Joe sent me an orchid.
- Oh, boy!
My, that powder!
- Those from Bill?
- Aren't they pretty?
Beautiful.
I said, ''I don't think the car's out of gas.
If you think I'm walking home, you've got another guess coming.
I brought my roller skates.
And furthermore...''
Flo, for Pete's sakes! You've been on that telephone for two hours.
Oh, well, goodbye, Sally.
Who's taking me to the dance?
Well, who do you think? Herbert!
- How do I look?
- You don't look like a librarian.
- I don't feel like one.
- Connie, telephone call for you.
Babe, I was working on that step you were doing.
- I know it starts like this...
- No, you're all wrong.
You throw your hip out like this.
Then you do...
Oh, that's cute like that.
That's where that comes in.
Oh, I love that step.
Vamoose, Flo. See you later.
Okay, sure. See you later.
Don't tell me. I know.
He broke the date.
He's going with Pat.
Babe, I feel so awful.
Oh, Connie, don't cry. Please.
How could he do that?
Call up at the last minute?
He's horrible.
He's just so dumb.
He is not dumb.
He got 100 percent on his first French exam.
It's all my fault. I sicced her onto him. I had to open my big mouth!
Gee, Connie, I didn't know you liked him.
Fine friend I turned out to be.
Oh, don't blame yourself.
He didn't have to change his mind the minute she came running.
Not if he didn't want to.
I guess he wanted to.
Hey, Babe, you ready?
Connie, I'll stay here with you.
Oh, that's sweet, but it wouldn't help either one of us.
Well, there must be a way of fixing this. I'll try.
No, don't. Don't try to fix anything.
I don't want him anymore.
You have a good time.
Well, what'll you do?
Oh, I'll read my favorite book...
...Les Misérables.
Have fun.
Goodbye.
I thought I'd found my ideal man
I always knew he'd arrive
Though he's a true heart-appeal man
He doesn't know I'm alive
But I don't spend my time in grieving
I've learned the trick
Of make-believing
So if I can't have my real man
There's only one way to thrive
Just imagine
That he loves me dearly
Just imagine
That I'm his sincerely
I'm pretending
That he's sending
Love notes ending
''I love you''
Seems that he's there
As the day is closing
On his knees there
I hear him proposing
He's not present
Still it's pleasant
To just imagine
That it's true
Come on, hurry up.
Break it up.
We want to see if we have a game here Saturday.
Marlowe, Marlowe.
''D'' in English.
''D'' in history.
''D'' in physics.
''C'' in biology.
He never got those marks before.
He hasn't been studying. McClellan is leading him around by the nose.
- He just made it.
- Yeah? Where's the French marks?
They're not posted yet.
I passed everything.
Guess I'll play in the game Saturday.
You're a genius. All we have to do is worry about Tommy.
Where is he?
Hey, Babe, you passed everything!
I did?
Bobby! Bobby! I told you last night I'd pass.
Hey, did you see him last night?
Here comes Tommy.
Well, kids, here I is.
- Darling, it's ''here I am.''
- It's only slang.
I don't like you to speak badly.
Okay, darling. Hi, coach.
Hi, Poochie.
Hello, darling.
Well, do I play Saturday?
- Yeah, you passed everything.
- But...
- ''But''?
- The French marks aren't up yet.
You're not gonna worry about that.
My best subject.
Saturday's my big day.
We'll mop up the field with Colton.
- I hope so.
- And don't forget.
Saturday's a big day for another reason.
Don't you remember?
Oh, yeah, sure.
Well, shall we tell everybody?
Yes. Yes, why not?
Listen, everybody. Saturday, after Tommy wins the big game...
Oh, you tell them, Tommy.
All I wanted to say, kids, was that...
...after the big game with Colton Saturday...
...Pat and I are gonna announce our engagement.
- Holy mackerel!
- What is it?
''F.''
- They can't do this to me.
- Can't? They did.
Well, that's that.
''That's that''?
We've gotta do something.
You've gotta play that game Saturday.
I know. The dean!
Come in.
The dean and Professor Kennyon have decided to give Marlowe...
...a re-examination in French tomorrow afternoon.
How nice for him.
When can you start coaching him?
- Me?
- Sure.
Yes, you.
Marlowe says you're the best.
Tell Mr. Marlowe I thank him for the compliment, but I'm too busy.
Tell him to ask Miss McClellan.
- She says...
- I don't want them to bother you.
Pat speaks French, but she's not up on her grammar...
- Tell Mr. Marlowe, ''Quel fromage.''
- What?
I don't care what you think about Marlowe...
...but that game next Saturday is a dead duck without him.
- I don't care whether he plays or not.
- You don't?
You'd lose the game for us?
You're building the foundations of a lifetime guilt complex!
I know how you feel, but you've no choice.
- It's for dear old Tait.
- You gotta do something.
All right, for dear old Tait.
Tell Mr. Marlowe I'll meet him at the sorority house at 8:00.
In the kitchen.
Gee, thanks, Connie.
Now name the verbs that take être instead of avoir.
Aller, tomber, sortir...
...partir, venir...
I can't think of any more.
That's hardly the right attitude.
You have an exam to pass.
Yeah, I know.
Kennyon is devoting his time to giving you this chance.
I'm giving up my time.
The least you can do is concentrate.
I keep thinking of so many other things.
Connie, won't you even talk to me?
You were doing splendidly with those verbs. Would you try them again?
The moon belongs
To everyone
The best things in life
Are free
The stars belong
To everyone
They gleam there
For you and me
The flowers in spring
The robins that sing
The sunbeams that shine
They're yours
They're mine
And love
Can come to everyone
The best things in life
Are free
The flowers in spring
The robins that sing
Let me say I'm sorry. You haven't talked to me for two months.
There's nothing to talk about.
You'd better study, because if you study, you'll play.
And if you play, you'll win.
When you win, you'll be engaged to Pat. Isn't that what you want?
Yeah, sure.
That's what I want.
Finish that translation, then we'll be through for the night.
The best things in life
The best things in life
La lune, c'est à tout le monde
On n'a pas besoin d'argent
Le ciel, c'est là pour tout le monde
On n'a pas besoin d'argent
Les fleurs de printemps
Les oiseaux qui chantent
Ces belles choses sont tout
Pour moi
Pour vous
And love can come
To everyone
The best things in life
Are free
How am I doing?
Just a few little mistakes.
Mistakes.
I've made one after the other, starting with breaking that date with you.
Oh, that was no mistake.
You got what you wanted.
Yeah, I guess so.
Gee, it's funny to think about being engaged.
I wonder what it's like to be stuck with one person for life.
If it were the right one, you wouldn't see yourself as stuck.
I didn't exactly mean ''stuck.''
I mean, well...
Do you ever think about yourself after college, settled down and married?
Of course. I guess every girl has a pretty good idea of what she wants.
What do you want?
Oh, I guess I'd like to have a family to bring up...
...and be able to go to concerts and theaters, balcony seats...
...and have people over to the house, a nice little house.
A vine-covered cottage?
Or an apartment.
I guess the important thing is finding the right fellow.
It sounds pretty dull to you, doesn't it?
No, it sounds wonderful.
What do you want?
Well, I guess I...
Hello.
Just came in to see how the lesson's going.
The patient will live.
I didn't know a French lesson included singing love songs.
You were listening.
I heard Tommy's voice, and I naturally thought he was singing for me.
I need hardly remind you that we're practically engaged.
Making a play for a practically engaged man is a very unladylike thing to do.
So is listening at keyholes.
Oh, don't worry, Pat.
Tommy will get all the answers right because he loves you.
Even if he didn't, I wouldn't want him.
I wouldn't want him if he were the last man here.
You picked the perfect mate for yourself.
He's inconsiderate, vain, selfish, and you can't believe a word he says.
And the same goes for you. You deserve to be stuck with each other.
Congratulations!
I know you'll both be very happy.
I wonder where Connie is.
What's going on?
Well, do you want to correct it?
Oh, he passed, all right.
It's almost silly to look.
Well, we'll see.
- What is this? Some kind of a joke?
- What?
Listen to this.
''Name the French verbs that take être.''
Answer: ''Hit her over the head with a hockey stick.''
What?
''Give the French word for 10 objects in the room.''
Answer: ''The best things in life are free.''
Go ahead.
''Write an essay in French describing your home.'' He answered in English.
''A vine-covered apartment with people on the balcony and 12 children.''
- Oh, that's wonderful!
- Wonderful?
- Professor, do you know what this means?
- I certainly do not.
- It means he loves me.
- What?
- He loves me.
- What are you talking about?
He knows French. He could've passed, but he wanted to flunk. Don't you see?
No, I don't see.
He didn't pass so he couldn't play, so he wouldn't be engaged to Pat.
He loves you so much he'd even lose the game for the school?
And I love him too.
Just a minute, Connie.
You tell me this boy really knows his French?
He knows it cold.
I've got to admire him.
He made a big sacrifice...
...giving up something that must mean a good deal to him, winning that game.
It means a good deal to the school too.
I know, but...
As you are aware, I'm not the school's greatest football enthusiast...
...but under the circumstances...
...I think I ought to pass him.
- Pass him?
You'd feel guilty if he didn't play in that game.
But if he wins, Pat's got him.
Work out your personal problems without involving the whole school.
I'm afraid you'll have to find some other way.
Well, I hate to say it, but I guess you're right.
Well, I'll leave it up to you.
Shall I pass him?
- Hey, Connie!
- Did he pass?
- Come on.
- Let us know!
Here she comes now.
After carefully considering
Mr. Marlowe's...
...unusual examination paper...
...and being somewhat surprised...
...at the rather remarkable answers to some of the questions...
...Professor Kennyon has decided that...
Well, he's interested...
...and though he doesn't approve of some of the phrasing used...
...he feels that Mr. Marlowe has demonstrated...
...a real feeling for the language.
Well, what is it?
He passed.
Marlowe showed them
A thing or two
He's a ladies' man
He's a ''wow''
With the parlez-vous
So Marlowe
Big man on the campus
Marlowe, it's all up to you
To come through!
Number 16, pass.
Hike.
What does that lug Marlowe think he's doing? Playing tiddlywinks?
He sure isn't trying very hard to win.
Trying to win?
He's the best man Colton has!
Isn't his little woman here to spur him on to glory?
Pat's at the house fixing her prom dress.
I suppose she figures the game's in the bag.
Beef, are you hurt?
Take a breath.
- That hurt?
- A little.
- Doc, how bad is it?
- Can't tell until we take an x-ray.
Come over to the infirmary.
We'd better finish the game here.
- But I didn't...
- Take it easy. Save your strength.
We may need you for the Maypole dance next spring.
You're all invited.
That's right, laugh.
Enjoy yourselves.
Popcorn! Cracker Jacks!
Champagne for everyone!
All right!
You thought I'd come in here and bawl the living daylights out of you.
Scream. Rant! Lose my mind!
But nothing like that's gonna happen.
I'm perfectly calm.
I'm not gonna let a little old football game upset me!
Take it easy.
I could tell you what you've done wrong, but you know what you did.
Zubrowski, that end run.
Hepple! Hepple, where were you?
Sternsdorf, offside three times.
Fifteen yards!
Thompson.
Thompson, haven't you heard?
The forward pass has been legal for 15 years.
Okay! What's the use?
Of course, I know the one thing that's really wrong.
Marlowe, you're not playing at all.
If you'd get in there and play, they'd all play with you.
- What's eating you, Tommy?
- Nothing. I'm all right.
''All right''?
You're so all right, you'll spend the rest of the game on the bench.
That's final!
All right. Ha!
If you're all right, then I'm crazy.
I'll prove it to you.
Turner, come here.
Me, sir?
Our two best players are out of the game.
So I thought it'd be an interesting form of suicide to put you in.
Gee, that's great, coach.
I'll kill them. I'll kill them!
I'll tear them apart. I'll show them.
For dear old Tait, I'll do or die!
What spirit! Look at that.
There's inspiration for you.
New blood in the game. That good old
Tait spirit. And no one can beat it.
You won't let all those people down.
Not all those people out there!
Not all those little old ladies who sweep up the stadium.
I mean...
That's it! Bobby!
Bobby, my boy.
Fellas, get up off your benches and get in there and fight!
I wish I had a broken rib.
You shouldn't say that.
You still got a chance to win.
Win what? The game?
And Pat too. Don't you want to announce your engagement to her?
Not when I'm in love with Connie.
Connie?!
Connie!
Beef! Here we are.
- You all right?
- I'll be x-rayed.
Down in front.
You can't just sit here.
Tommy's losing the game!
What can I do?
He said if he wins, he gets the wrong girl because he loves you!
Aw, sit down!
You mean Tommy really loves Connie?
Yeah, and she's gotta give him a pep talk.
But if I do, then I lose him forever.
Holy smoke! You mean it's true?
Then we gotta do something.
You love him. He loves you.
We gotta get rid of Pat.
Why did I ever tell her
Tommy was the Pickle King?
Pickle King?
Have you got your brother-in-law's car?
- Sure. Have you seen it?
- No, but I'd love to.
- We're going.
- You gonna talk to Tommy?
I'm going to the house.
See you later.
- But my x-rays.
- Yes!
Faster.
I don't understand.
Oh, please, Beef,
I've got to concentrate.
There. You wait here, Beef.
If someone comes out before I do, give her a lift.
- All right, but I don't understand.
- You will.
I'm glad you're back.
The sink...
Never mind that.
You've got to help me.
- Have you ever acted in a play?
- What?
I mean, have you ever recited lines like...
...Sarah Bernhardt or Ethel Barrymore?
You know.
- You mean play-acting?
- Yes. Come on.
Wait a minute. I've written it all down. Don't talk till you get there.
Oh, Cora! I'm so unhappy!
Oh, Cora, I had to come back from the game.
I couldn't stand it anymore.
It's so awful.
We're winning!
Tommy is piling up touchdown after touchdown.
And by tonight, he'll be engaged to that awful Pat McClellan.
I hate her!
''Now, now, Miss Connie, you better forget all about it.
He loves her and that's all there is to it.''
''Oh, I can't stand it!
She's got him for life.''
''Does she love him?''
''Oh, I suppose she does.
After all, she stuck by him, even through what just happened.''
''Through what just happened?''
''Haven't you heard?
Tommy's father, the Pickle King, he's gone bankrupt.''
''Really?''
''Yes. A terrible cucumber blight in Iowa.
He's a ruined man.
Tommy is penniless!''
''No!''
''Well, I guess Pat won't mind.
She'll be glad to scrimp and scrub and save and sew...
...because she'll have him.
After all...
...when you have love, money doesn't really matter.
Does it, Cora?''
''Does it, Cora?'' I mean, I mean...
''She could clear 15...
...or 20 taking in washing.''
''Oh, but she has such pretty hands.''
''Oh, well, it's her problem now.''
''Poor child. Why don't you go back to the game?''
''No, I can't watch anymore.
Beef drove me over. He's outside now.
He's been paying a lot of attention to me ever since...
...Babe gave him back his fraternity pin.
But I guess I love Tommy too much.''
''Beef is a very fine fellow, no.''
''Oh, a girl could do worse.
Just think, he's one of the richest boys at Tait.
Dairy products, you know.
Worth millions!
Have you seen that new car of his?''
''Oh, my, it is a wow. Yes.''
''Just think. Such a catch...
...and completely unattached.
Maybe I'd better hold on to him before someone else gets there.''
- Was it all right?
- Marvelous!
Gee, why must everyone get literary in my car?
Please forgive me, Beef.
This is very important.
You will forgive me, won't you?
Gee, I'd forgive you anything.
Ready. Hike!
Hey, Tommy, I've got something for you.
''Can't stand in the way of true love.
Make big sacrifice.
Give you up. Pat.''
Hey, Beef! This is it!
Hey! Thanks.
Coach! I'm all right now.
May I go in?
Marlowe, I can't figure it.
We got three minutes. Go ahead.
All right, 32 is our only chance.
Bobby, you know the play?
Okay, hike.
Tommy, we've been looking for you.
Where have you been?
Wait a minute. Wait.
Has anyone seen Connie?
I've gotta go.
So we're on the 40-yard line, and I've got the ball.
So I turn around...
I got squatter's rights!
All right, break it up, girls.
Come here, woman, and kiss me.
Where's Beef?
I'm not afraid of him.
Hey, Beef! Are you looking?
Gee, I used to think I had a mother fixation.
You're not a bit like her.
I like you better.
Beefy, you're a panic.
- Do you think he's here?
- Of course he is.
I can't understand why he didn't call.
He still thinks that you don't like him.
After five minutes, you'll be in each others' arms.
- Really?
- Check, please.
Oh, Van Dyne.
Would you take Miss Lane inside?
I left my pipe.
- I'd be delighted.
- Thank you, Peter.
You just look adorable tonight.
Why, Peter.
Van Dyne!
Who'd you expect her to come with,
Professor Kennyon?
I don't know what to expect.
I'm going home.
- Marlowe.
- Yes, sir?
- Where are you rushing off to?
- I'm going home.
- Isn't it a bit early?
- Yes, sir.
Don't leave so soon. I think there's someone inside looking for you.
- Who?
- Connie Lane, to be exact.
She can't stand the sight of me.
So you're going home?
You're just leaving?
Slinking away like Napoleon from Waterloo.
Did you speak to her?
You didn't even speak to her?
What's the matter with you?
You don't do this in football.
In a losing battle, you try harder!
Don't give up. How do you know she doesn't love you?
What is it your coach says?
You've got to?
- Get in there...
- Yes! Get in there and fight.
Good luck.
Connie!
Connie?
Oh, it's you. I thought you'd left.
How'd you know?
Somebody told me.
Well, I almost left.
What stopped you?
Nothing stopped me, I'm leaving now.
Where are you going?
Where am I going? I'm going home!
Where do people generally go?
Home.
You staying?
Oh, yes. I'm having a lovely time.
Why don't you go back inside?
I like it out here.
I think it's utterly delightful out here.
And besides, no one's gonna tell me where to go! Why don't you go inside?
I'm leaving.
I don't have to go inside.
Then why don't you leave?
Because I love you!
That's a ridiculous thing to say.
Well, I said it.
- I'm glad.
- What?
I'm glad!
- Oh, you are?
- Yes.
In that case, I've got a lot of things to say.
For instance?
Remember the day when you gave me the French lesson?
There are a lot of things you could teach me...
...and that's the way I want it to be.
You name it.
I'll do anything you say.
- Anything?
- Try me.
Down on your heels.
Down on my heels?
Up on your toes.
Up on my toes? What's that?
That's the way to do the Varsity Drag
We've always thought
Knowledge is naught
We should be taught
To dance
Right here at Tait
We're up-to-date
We teach a great
New dance
Don't think that I brag
I speak of the Drag
Why should a sheik
Learn how to speak
Latin and Greek
Badly?
Give him a neat
Motto complete
Say it with feet
Gladly
First lesson right now
You'll love it
And how you'll love it
Here is the Drag
See how it goes
Down on your heels
Up on your toes
That's the way to do the Varsity Drag
Hotter than hot
Newer than new
Meaner than mean
Bluer than blue

As waving the flag
You can pass many a class
Whether you're dumb or wise
If you all answer the call
When your professor cries
''Everybody, down on the heels
Up on the toes
Stay after school
Learn how it goes''
Everybody do the Varsity Drag
Here is the Drag
See how it goes
Down on your heels

That's the way to do the Varsity Drag
Hotter than hot

C'est bon
The show fini
The moral to this tale is
Learn to parlez-vous
Send her a billet doux
Tell her
Her eyes are blue
They sure are blue!
Je vous adore
Means I love you
Come here to me
Good news!
- Hello, Countess.
- How did you get here?
Through the window.
Forgot to mail me my invitation.
- Go away.
- No.
- I said go away.
- And I said no.
- What do you want now?
- I had to see you just once more.
I have nothing to say to you.
Don't want you to say anything.
I want you to listen.
Can't we go somewhere and talk?
I hate you, loathe you, despise you.
You didn't always.
There was a time you loved me.
- Wasn't there, Countess?
- Swine.
The Emperor will have them shot, both of them!
Let me see.
That the lenses of these opera glasses don't crack for shame!
Isn't that the daughter of Baron Holenia?
Yes. Johanna Augusta
Franziska, Countess
Von Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg,
- disgracing every syllable of her name.
- But who is he?
- That's the man, that's the one.
- That's the who?
The man. Haven't you heard?
Where have you been?
In a mud bath in Bad Nauheim, trying to cure my poor heart.
- I'd forgotten your heart.
- It's nothing. Don't stop now.
Very well, you've asked for it.
It's a love affair that has rocked all Vienna for the past 4 months.
Who is he?
The most vulgar, impossible, obnoxious, ill-mannered...
- In one word, an American.
- No!
Yes. And low even among Americans.
He's what they call a traveling salesman.
A traveling salesman and a baron's daughter.
You heard about the attempt on the Emperor's life?
- That's the man.
- Mercy!
He swindled an appointment with His Majesty... by presenting himself as a great potentate.
Later, it transpired he was a very minor potentate... in an American organization known as the Shriners.
I remember the day he came to the palace with his nasty little dog... and a mysterious, sinister black box.
Do you know what was in that box?
How are you today?
Will you follow me, please?
Here, Buttons.
Stop chewing that gum.
Here, give it to me.
Come here.
Scheherazade, please.
Remember your manners.
And do stop fidgeting with your moustache.
I'm not nervous. I know perfectly well why the Emperor has summoned us.
So do I. He's found out
You belong in jail.
You're talking to your father.
That's what's so depressing.
My own father, a scoundrel.
Mortgaging the mortgage on our castle which was already mortgaged.
How was I to know?
I'm not a businessman:
I'm a general.
Then taking the money and gambling it away in a single night.
The cards were marked.
Two duels already this season,
Named as corespondent in the divorce of some suburban pastry baker, sued by a young lady in the chorus at the opera... because you promised her the lead in Aida.
The little fool.
I'm not the director of the opera, I'm a general.
As I was trying to say
16 insults ago,
I don't believe the Emperor summoned us on account of me at all.
He summoned us on account of you.
Me? What have I done?
I have an idea someone has expressed an interest in you... and the Emperor wants to arrange a marriage.
Oh, nonsense. His Majesty knows I'm still in mourning.
Two years of mourning for a husband you couldn't endure, is enough.
Yes, I see a highly satisfactory new marriage.
Some member of the Belgian diplomatic corps, or perhaps a Russian duke.
I like Russians, don't you?
Money just oozes from them.
And, dear Papa,
You could always mortgage the Kremlin.
His Excellency the General Baron Holenia... and the Countess
Von Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg.
Oh, Baron Holenia.
My dear Johanna.
Oh, get up.
Sorry I can't kiss your hand.
Bad cold.
And how is Scheherazade?
You're wearing new perfume, aren't you?
Even I can smell it with my stuffed up nose.
Oh, sit down, do.
Louis, come on.
Say hello to Scheherazade.
Why do they always pick a damp day for me to inaugurate a bridge... or open a horticultural exhibition, or...
Oh, well. Mustn't grumble.
It's the hazard of the profession.
If I may be permitted a suggestion, has Your Majesty tried pine needles in boiling water, inhaling the vapor under a towel?
Pine needles?
Certainly not.
Shouldn't want my whiskers to smell like 2 old Christmas trees.
Has, uh, anything particular come up lately?
You ask that?
Look at my desk.
Reports, complaints, unforgivable stupidities, downright dishonesty, thievery!
Go on, look at them.
I'd rather not,
Your Majesty.
I don't blame you.
Now, do you know why
I summoned you here today?
Yes. I mean, no.
I mean...
We have rather an inkling,
Your Majesty.
Then what are you looking so gloomy about?
Don't you approve of the alliance?
Alliance?
A marriage!
Do you or don't you know what 'm talking about?
Yes. I mean, no.
I mean...
We have rather an inkling, Your Majesty.
This match means a great deal to me.
I've given it infinite thought.
I've looked up the blood lines
 on both sides.
Fine, fine.
One couldn't ask for better.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
I brought Johanna up to realize that blood comes first.
What pleases me most, both lines are very prolific.
Oh, little embarrassing to talk about this.
Not at all, Your Majesty.
I anticipate superb offspring.
And I'm going to be a little greedy about them.
Greedy?
Well, I'm a lonely man.
I've lost my wife, my son.
It'll warm my heart to see the little things crawling around.
A great honor.
If there are five, I want three.
Is that exorbitant?
Your Majesty!
Don't be picayune, if it will give the Emperor any happiness.
- As for the bridegroom,
- Yes, Your Majesty.
I think the union should be brought about as quickly as possible.
Of course, Your Majesty.
Spry as he is, he's a rather elderly gentleman.
- How old, Your Majesty.
- Twelve.
Twelve!
- Johanna, what possible import...
Twelve?
Not quite. He will be on the 7th of September.
I suggest that the nuptials take place in my kennels.
Kennels?
With all that barking going on?
We're talking about the poodles!
His Majesty's dog is asking for the paw of Scheherazade.
Ohhh. Of course.
I'm no fool.
Scheherazade, did you hear of your engagement?
What do you say?
How about a piece of sugar?
I'd love it.
Buttons, come here, come here.
Pull yourself together.
You'll spoil the sale for me.
You want to eat, don't you?
Must have wound the mainspring too tight.
It's not supposed to do that
'til I pull the switch.
There's a plot on the life of the Emperor.
A time bomb!
That black box!
What's the matter?
I guess you'd like to know what this is.
I'm not telling.
I'm gonna work it on the Emperor first.
What a bang he's gonna get out of it.
This is gonna kill him!
Ho-ho! Am I laughing?
Got a match? Here we are.
He'll be in sections.
This is gonna kill him.
You'll pardon my intrusion,
Your Majesty.
Will Your Majesty please make all the haste possible?
- What is it now?
- A precautionary measure, Your Majesty.
- There seems to be an assassin.
- Oh, dear.
This gets to be such a bore. Sorry.
Here. Here now!
What's the idea? Come here!
Hey, wait a minute!
Hey, you! Wait a minute!
What's the matter with you?
Are you crazy?
You're under arrest!
- Let go of me!
- And drop that dog, you dogs!
Search him! Now, who are your confederates?
We want every name.
Is this the Emperor's palace or a loony bin?
You came here as a potentate.
Are you a potentate?
I may have stretched things a little, but I'm a Shriner. Paid up.
- You're a nihilist.
- I am not. I'm a Presbyterian.
A lie again. It says here that you're a salesman.
Listen, wobble-face, isn't it possible to be a Presbyterian Shriner salesman?
- You're trying to confuse me.
- I am also a registered Democrat, a member of the Chamber of Commerce, a sandlot third baseman, and I...
Not so fast!
I have to talk fast.
If I don't, my sample's gonna rust in your fish pond.
Careful!
It might explode.
- I wish it would.
- It cannot. The powder's all wet.
It must be some new model with a cannon attached.
You must be an old windbag with a blabbermouth attached.
I never saw such a bunch of ignoramuses.
Here, Buttons, we'll show 'em the trademark.
Does that mean anything to you?
It doesn't, hey?
Well, it's an invention.
A talking machine.
A new kind of American thingamabob.
Watch this.
We have a record, we put it on the machine thus.
We start the works in this manner.
Drop the needle in that fashion.
Something wrong here.
What do you... What's going on?
This is not standard equipment.
With Your Majesty's permission,
Your Majesty may come out now.
About time. I was beginning to feel like a corkscrew.
- What was it this time?
- A false alarm, Your Majesty.
An American salesman trying to force his way in.
A most persistent breed, these Americans.
One threw himself in front of my carriage.
He was selling brushes.
Wanted me to buy two for my whiskers.
Also a clothes brush, shoe brush, nail brush and a tooth brush.
Incredible.
We finally bought a mop and had him deported.
Where were we now?
The dogs, Your Majesty.
The final arrangements.
Oh, yes. Louis and I will be at my hunting lodge in the Tyrol... for the next three weeks.
I want you to come and stay with me and bring Scheherazade.
We are most honored,
Your Majesty.
I think the happy couple will find the mountain air quite invigorating.
As to transportation, have you any objections to the horseless carriage?
None whatever, Your Majesty.
Then I'll send my automobile to bring you up next Tuesday.
Good-bye, Baron.
Good-bye, my dear Johanna.
May I personally guarantee Your Majesty a most glorious litter?
Thank you.
I shall see you in the mountains.
Everybody return to his quarters.
No tradesperson is permitted in the palace.
You will pack that squalling abomination and leave at once!
- Out! Out! Out!
- Oh, no, I don't.
I'm gonna wait 'til it dries and show it to the old boy, as per my appointment!
- To whom will you show it?
- To the Emperor.
If you play ball, I won't tell him what a monkey You made out of yourself.
You will never see the Emperor.
I'd protect His Majesty from that object as I'd protect him from a bomb.
You listen to me, chubby, I didn't come to Austria to run into that kind of guff.
I came here to put that machine over and I'm gonna.
I'm gonna sell 5,000,
Not in Austria,
I assure you.
We do not take to cheap, blatant innovations.
You're a bunch of dusty old aunties, scared of anything new.
You wouldn't have put in the electric light, bought an automobile, only the Emperor did.
He's gonna buy the first one of these and endorse it.
And when he does, you watch the sales skyrocket.
Yo-ho! They're going up.
And perhaps you will take a photograph of our Emperor... looking into that horn, in place of your dog.
Don't you realize this is the greatest thing that's happened to the Holenias... in ten generations?
- Will it pay the butcher's bill?
What butcher would dare present his bill to the Emperor's brother-in-law?
- What was that?
- My poor demented daughter... don't you realize we've just become part of the Emperor's family?
All because of some arrangement about puppies?
Thanks to those puppies
Your father is now... the most important man in the monarchy, inseparable from the Emperor.
He and I will sit together waiting for them to be born.
We'll feed the little things with medicine droppers, spread newspapers for them, take them on walks.
I shall have the Emperor's ear and advise him on matters of state.
I may become ambassador to Paris, or minister of finance.
-  Oh, not that, Father.
As for you, Johanna, magnificent vistas have opened up.
What's wrong with the young king of Spain?
Or there's an English princeling.
Father, to return to the butcher, how are we to provide... meat for the bride, if she's to be kept alive for the happy event?
Don't be ridiculous. We now have all the credit in the world.
So Vienna thought we had gone to the dogs?
Gone to the dogs, indeed!
Stop dawdling. We've endured your presence long enough.
Aw, your emperor's sideburns!
What are you doing now?
Disrobing in the palace grounds?
What a fussy old dude you are.
You're worse than a worm on a hot rock.
I'll give you one more minute to get that object out of here!
That's what's known as Viennese charm, Buttons.
If you ever see me order wienerschnitzel again, you can spit right in my eye!
Here, Buttons.
Come back here.
- Hey, Buttons!
- Go away, You nasty mongrel!
What are you up to?
You bad dog, you. Here!
What's the matter?
Hey! Hey, you!
This dog is bleedin'.
What did you do to my dog?
- Stop! Hey!
- That's enough!
You bet it is.
We've been kicked around, thrown in the water, snapped at, bitten.
Who do those people think they are?
They are His Excellency,
Baron Holenia... and the Countess Von
Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg.
Where do they live?
The Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg palace on Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg Square.
That's a lot of Stolzenberg.
And don't tell us to get out
'cause we're gittin'.
- You rang, sir?
- Does a black dog live here?
- I beg your pardon?
- A French poodle about that size.
Tell her she has to see a man about a dog.
Perhaps if you would clarify the nature of your business, S Ir.
Hey, you!
What's the idea of just running off after your dog has bitten my dog?
I don't expect decent manners of that thing, but human beings we expect to act halfway human.
Take off your hat.
Look at that leg.
Bitten clear to the bone.
It bled all over my rented suit.
I doubt if my birds care for the smell of your hat.
Fry your birds!
I'm talkin' about my dog.
Your dog ought to have a muzzle and not a leather muzzle, a steel one.
Don't let him upset you, darling.
Look at that silly haircut.
Who trims her, the guy that trims your hedges?
What is it that you want?
Damages for your mongrel, money for cleaning your trousers?
I want a saliva test made of her, and I want it right now
You want what?
A saliva test.
She may be mad.
That silly lookin' thing may have the rabies!
I'll thank you not to use such vile words when you talk about her.
All right, hydrophobia, then.
Have you watched her for symptoms?
Has she been frothing at the mouth?
Does her bark sound croupy?
My dear man, if either of these two dogs is mad, it's yours.
My veterinary goes over Scheherazade from snout to tail every week.
She's a dog of superb pedigree and she gets superb care.
Oh, listen, any mutt can have rabies.
For the last time, will you stop referring to her as a mutt?
Have you ever heard of blood lines?
Hers goes back to the 18th century.
Hmpf. His goes back to as far as they've been havin' dogs.
Perhaps you've heard of one of her ancestors,
Papillion, the poodle of Marie Antoinette.
They were both guillotined in the French Revolution.
Smart move.
Her father belongs to Czar Nicholas of Russia.
- You don't say.
- Her mother to the Infanta of Spain.
His mother belongs to a milkman in Springfield, Illinois. And his father...
His father. Well,
You've got me there.
Her twin brothers belong to a Cardinal and live in the Vatican.
As for Scheherazade herself, she has just become engaged... to the dog of His Majesty,
Francis Joseph the First.
Yeah? Well, Buttons' brother helps a kid named Stinky O'Hara deliver newspapers... and his sister was making an honest living as a watchdog... until she was hit by the Baltimore and Ohio.
- How really fascinating.
- If your poodle is so classy... how come she doesn't know better than to go around biting a nice little dog?
If your animal is so clever, it should know better than to approach a dog... of an entirely different class.
All he did is go up to her and say,
"How do you do?" That's all.
He thrust his ugly, ill-bred little face right at hers.
- And for that she bit him.
- Certainly.
And she was right?
Absolutely. There are such things as class distinctions.
- How's that?
- Class distinctions, I said.
I thought that's what you said.
Two kinds of blood you mean?
Blue blood and the kind we have.
The kind you get at the five and ten cent store.
Precisely. You must admit there's a difference between...
Stinky O-something-or-other and the Emperor of Austria.
There is the lowbred and the highbred.
If the lowbred has the impertinence to come distastefully close, what can he expect but to be bitten?
- Is that so?
- It is.
Okay.
Now you bite me.
I would have horsewhipped him then and there, the revolting little plebian.
You saw him. Ears like a bat and the rest of him like a plucked duck.
Perhaps there's more to him than meets the eye.
So it would seem from what happened in the mountains.
What happened in the mountains?
A conflagration of the wildest passion...
- Please! Remember the archduchess's heart.
- Go on. What happened?
- For your own sake, Isabella.
- Oh, go on, or I shall fling myself from this balcony.
All right, it's your heart.
It seems that that little horror... found out the Emperor was going to the Tyrol.
So being an American...
They'll do anything in their mad pursuit of the almighty dollar.
 If you feel a song
 Then let the song begin
And you'll find the friendly mountains joining in
Joining in
 Loosen up your pipes
 And brother you can bet
It's as pretty as a barbershop quartet
 Quartet
 Quartet
 Quartet
 Quartet
 Quartet
 Quartet
 Quartet
 Quartet
 You can raise your voice
 And sing out hip-hooray
 But it always comes back
 Give the birds a break
 And hustle up a song
 And let the friendly mountains
 Sing along
 If you feel a song
 Then let the song begin
And you'll find the friendly mountains joining in
 When your melody
 Goes rollin' 'round the sky
 Well you'll feel that
You're a pretty nifty guy
Pretty nifty guy
Pretty nifty guy
Pretty nifty guy
You there, halt!
I just wanted to look the place over.
It's very nice too.
Come on, Buttons.
No visitors while our Emperor's in residence.
- Is he in there now?
- It's the hunting season.
When he hunts, doesn't he come out here once in a while?
- Every morning. Early. 4 o'clock.
- Through this gate?
Through this gate, down that road, through this gorge and up that mountain.
Down that road, through that gorge and up that mountain, huh?
With your very kind permission, the car is boiling.
Well, don't stand there.
Get some cool water from some brook.
With your very kind permission,
I shall.
We're almost there,
Scheherazade.
You better take her goggles off.
They give her a headache.
She's perfectly all right,
Father.
Her nose is dry and hot.
She's running a temperature.
- I told you she should have worn her blanket!
- Don't be hysterical, Father.
How can I help being hysterical?
If she should come down with distemper... Heaven forbid!
Relax. Breathe in this heavenly air!
Yes, it'll do her good.
This Tyrol...
It's like a vast oxygen tent.
Listen to that yodel.
It's the voice of Austria.
Mountain-born, deep-rooted, eternal.
What is it, Scheherazade?
What's biting you, anyway?
Here, Buttons.
Come here.
Scheherazade!
Catch her!
Come here!
Scheherazade!
Let her go!
He's biting her, he's killing her!
Take that black beast out of here! Whoa!
Here, here, here.
There.
Yoo-hoo.
- This I find outrageous!
- Small world, isn't it?
- Are you following me?
- No. Are you?
This is the same objectionable American, isn't it?
I'll take care of him.
Get Scheherazade in the car.
I'll give her some brandy.
If you don't mind,
I should like to ask you a few questions.
You look mighty sweet in that.
Like a piece of candy wrapped up in tissue paper.
Exactly why are you here, dressed like that?
If I wanted to make a deal with the Sultan of Morocco, I'd come dressed like a dervish.
You're here on business?
They don't pay my expenses to come up here and yodel.
Ah, yes, I've heard of that peculiar object you're peddling.
- You wish to sell it to the Emperor?
- That's right.
You're here at His
Majesty's request?
Let's not get technical.
Where are you staying?
Down in the village at the Golden Fiddle Inn.
They have a very attractive upstairs maid. A redhead.
Exactly how will you manage to see His Majesty?
I shan't see him: he's going to see me. Or hear me.
- Or rather, he's gonna hear my machine.
- Go on.
Every morning he goes out shooting deer.
He goes out his gate, down that gorge and up that mountain.
One of these mornings I shall hide behind a tree or something, get my machine set up and suddenly...
- And then?
- Once he hears it it'll be a cinch.
He'll say, "How come that beautiful band is up here playing... in these little bitty old doggone hills of mine?
That's what he'll say?
Yes. And I shall pop from behind my tree and say,
"Emp, that's no band, that's a phonograph.
Come over here and see for yourself."
Very clever. Only it won't work.
Why won't it?
Because the Emperor will not hear that loathsome apparatus.
Because you will not be hiding behind any trees.
Because no tradesman can presume on the Emperor of Austria.
You're to go straight to your hotel, pack and leave immediately, you and that dog.
- Who'd gonna make us?
- The police.
Like fun, they will.
I'm an American citizen.
He's an American dog.
I have a passport.
He has a dog licence.
If you don't leave voluntarily, the gendarmes will come... and take you and your dog by the nape of your necks and throw you on the train.
Try anything like that and you're gonna get in a peck of trouble.
Don't forget that Teddy Roosevelt still carries a big stick.
- Who carries what?
- You start a fight with me... and he'll have the United States Army here so fast it'll make your head swim.
Johanna, get in the car.
Scheherazade has fainted twice.
The Army, Navy and the Marines,
You understand?
And don't forget we're building a little something called the Panama Canal.
What's he talking about?
You'll find out when we won't let your ships through.
You'll have to go all the way down around South America.
Or else you'll have to go all the way up north where it's so cold that...
The first train out of here.
You, your apparatus and dog.
Especially that dog.
We'll fix you in Washington.
What we'll do to your ambassador!
We'll boycott your product!
The Blue Danube forbidden by act of congress!
Shut up!
- Johanna.
- Come in, Father.
Aren't you getting dressed?
They're all downstairs on the terrace.
- Quiet, Father.
- Have you glanced out the window?
The Emperor has invited us with a group that offers rather interesting possibilities.
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing. It's Scheherazade.
- What's wrong now?
- The Emperor's veterinary is with her.
- She's had a nervous breakdown.
- A nervous...
- No!
- A complete collapse.
They were bathing her and she was perfectly all right...
'til she saw another dog, a small dachshund.
She began screaming.
They tested her with another dog, a tiny chihuahua: the same hysteria.
When they brought in the
Emperor's dog to calm her, she broke loose, jumped through a window and ran amok.
Apparently, she can't stand the sight of another dog.
- Has the Emperor been told?
- Not yet.
We hope the veterinary will be able to do something.
That inconsiderate, ungrateful black animal!
Jeopardizing all our chances!
Come here.
The Hungarian officer playing cards, that's Prince Istvan
Barlossy de Baloshasa.
I met him in Budapest.
Didn't like him very much.
Nonsense. Since then he's inherited half of Buda and a large part of Pest.
What have you against the
Marques Alonso Lafuente?
Which one is he?
The handsome one with the tennis racket.
Greatest family in Andalusia.
Castles in Spain, literally.
Seven of them.
You still haven't mentioned the best possibility.
Do you mean
Duke Ferdi Lindendorf?
No, the Princess Bitotska.
I'm thinking of you, Father.
Don't be disgusting.
She's had her one good eye on you for years.
She's old enough to be my mother.
She still plays tennis.
She ought to be in a wheelchair, the arthritic old horror.
Let's go and see if that beast of yours is feeling any better.
I repeat: It is extremely important that the patient speak anything in her mind.
Anything at all.
We need a complete stream of consciousness.
Is that clear?
Thank you very much.
Now, I would like to know all about your dreams.
You dream,
I presume?
All right.
What do you dream?
Is it a recurrent dream?
Very good.
A typical anxiety dream.
What is all this, Doctor?
Please! This is a very serious case.
Indubitably a psychoneurosis, sometimes called a neuropsychosis.
Fortunately, I went to the University of Vienna... with a young doctor by the name Freud.
He has created a curative method: the analysis of the psyche by delving into the subconscious.
Now I must ask for your earliest recollections.
Your father and mother:
Was their home life congenial?
Doctor, stop torturing her.
I can tell you what's wrong.
She had a fight with a dog.
She did?
Twice. Once in Vienna and once this very afternoon.
The same dog.
You see? That's what leads to wrong diagnoses.
Patients withhold things.
What kind of a dog?
American.
Small, white, male.
- What was his name?
- Buttons.
Let's test it.
Buttons!
Absolutely clear now.
A fear complex.
Frightened by one dog, now afraid of all dogs.
- I may kill her.
- Is there a cure?
In some cases. The patient has developed what I and my colleague, Dr. Freud, call a mental block.
What is the cure,
Doctor?
The frightened one must realize she has nothing to be afraid of.
In other words, we must bring the two dogs together.
- That's impossible.
- It is imperative.
I gave orders to have them both removed.
The man and the dog.
I may kill you.
Without the other dog,
I see very black.
Maybe it's not too late.
Come, darling, don't tremble like that.
Don't be nervous.
Everything's going to be...
With your very kind permission, exactly what inn was it?
The Fiddle Inn.
There are three Fiddle
Inns: the Green Fiddle, the Golden Fiddle and the Broken Fiddle.
How idiotic.
With your very kind permission, the whole village is fiddles.
That's what they make here.
Fiddles.
I've got to find him before it's too late.
The American, has he left?
No, but he is leaving.
Number 7.
If you do not hurry, you will miss the train.
So we miss the train. So what?
So you will be pulled out of here by ox cart.
I think you're full of pickled pumpernickel, the both of you.
All right, you little bundle of joy. Come on.
Up! In you go.
Well, if it isn't the Countess!
Don't you trust them?
We're leaving.
Step outside, you two.
And close the door.
I have to talk to you.
We'll miss the train.
You're not going on that train.
What are you gonna do, shoot us out of a cannon?
I need your help.
Well. You don't say.
My dog is outside in a state of complete collapse.
Small wonder. You people take those high-strung critters, breed them, interbreed them, over breed them, something in their noggins is bound to start rattling.
She was perfectly all right until she saw your dog...
All Buttons did was walk up...
Let's not go into it.
I'm here to demand your cooperation.
The reason for Scheherazade's breakdown is fear... and the reason for her fear is your dog.
The only cure is to get back to the source of that fear, thus eliminating the mental block.
Are you following me?
Countess, you lost me back there around "cooperation."
To put it simply, if she could realize he is not a danger.
If your dog could be nice to my dog.
Oh, no. She might throw a flea on him.
I assure you this is a matter of the utmost importance.
It goes far beyond just curing a dog.
So we do you a favor and you kick us out. Is that it?
No, you can stay as long as you like, do what you like. I don't care.
Well, now you're talkin' sense.
I'll bring her in. There's no time to waste. See that your dog behaves.
Hold it, Countess, there's a word missing.
I beg your pardon?
- The word is please.
- Please.
Ah-ah-ah-ah.
You can do better than that.
- Please.
- Come again.
Please.
Getting warmer.
Please.
Bring in the mutt!
Leopold...
Put her on the bed here.
She's got it pretty bad, huh?
Here, you, quiet.
Shh!
The doctor says that she might go c-r-a-z-y.
We'll see what we can d-o.
Now, now, now.
Don't say no until you and I have had a chance to talk, man to man.
I'm gonna open this basket and you're gonna go and apologize like a little gentleman.
You understand?
Don't open the basket.
Let me handle this.
Come on, Buttons.
Come on, boy.
Gotta help me out now.
Remember that time in Munich when you became involved with the police...
'cause you lapped up all that beer in the ratskeller.
Who got you out of that?
Old Virgil, huh?
We won't talk about it now, no.
You've gotta help me out.
Go over there and apologize.
Go on. All right, so she did hurt your feelings.
So she's snooty and highfalutin.
But you're a pretty fresh little mutt yourself, you know.
But you're a man and it's up to the man to apologize. Now go ahead. Go on.
Her heart's beating like mad.
Proud, huh? And stubborn.
Look at her.
For once in your life you meet a real lady. And a mighty pretty one.
Look at those trim little ankles, hmm?
And that pompadour.
That's super deluxe, that's class.
Better than class: it's "clarss."
Go on, be nice to here.
Go ahead, move in.
Take charge. Atta boy.
Go on, Buttons.
Don't be afraid, Scheherazade.
He's a nice little dog.
Maybe he hasn't had some of the advantages.
It's no use.
Maybe we'd better stop.
Hey, Buttons. Hey.
I kiss your little hand, Madame...
 Your dainty fingertips
 And while in slumberland,
Madame...
 I'm begging for your lips
- I haven't any right, Madame
- I think she likes that.
 Sometimes I wonder
 If hearts are broken
By little love words that are left unspoken
 I always tremble
 When you are near me
 I'm looking for a ray of hope
 To cheer me
 I hope to keep my kisses warm
Until we meet in shadow form
 In dreams I kiss your hand, Madame
 Your dainty fingertips
And while in slumberland, Madame
 I'm begging for your lips
 I haven't any right, Madame
 To do the things I do
Just when I hold you tight, Madame
 You vanish with the night, Madame
 In dreams I kiss your hand, Madame
 And pray my dreams
 come true
I'm just putting it on a little... to give them the idea.
Oh.
- Nothing personal, you understand.
- Oh, I understand perfectly.
- I wouldn't presume...
- No, of course you wouldn't.
I haven't any right, Madame
 To do the things I do
Just when I hold you tight, Madame
 You vanish with the night, Madame
Thank you so much.
You've been most kind.
Oh, not at all.
It's a pleasure to do business with you.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Oh, Countess.
Yes?
You forgot something.
I did? What?
Your d-o-g.
Oh, of course.
He has missed the train.
What train?
The one he was going on.
Oh, he's not going.
Scheherazade.
Scheherazade.
Buttons.
She seems so wonderfully well.
Doesn't she, though?
Come on, Scheherazade, come on.
Come on, Buttons.
Here, boy.
Come on, Scheherazade,
Give Buttons back his ball.
Oh, no. Let her have it.
Compliments of the house.
You're very kind.
Good-bye.
- So long, Countess.
- Come on, Scheherazade.
If she should have a relapse, bring her back.
Thank you so much.
Any time.
Go on home,
You two.
You're telling me.
It's the biggest stag they've had up here in years, Your Majesty. I saw it myself.
Already I can see its head above Your Majesty's desk.
Those magnificent antlers,
18 points.
You can see the antlers but
I don't seem to see the stag.
It is up there in the glen,
I assure, Your Majesty. Listen.
Every morning for a week they've promised me that stag and no stag.
Not a shadow of a stag.
Today it will be there.
It must be. That stag dare not disappoint his emperor again.
Look at all those other men,
Putzi. I'm very angry with you.
Do you mind, Princess?
I do not like the name Putzi.
Not only am I angry,
I'm disappointed.
I did hope you'd wear those nice short leather pants.
Why?
For years I've wanted to see your knees.
You must have very good knees, my dear Putzi.
They're handsome knees.
They're my knees and I'm nobody's Putzi.
Aren't you being a little cold to the richest woman in Austria?
Not rich enough.
Besides, I have other prospects.
Such an exciting contrast,
Countess.
You, pale and blond against the brunette
Spanish landscape.
Spain is for bulls.
For a beautiful woman is Hungary... is Budapest, that wicked boudoir of a city.
No, entirely too much paprika, don't you think, Countess?
Let me show you Granada: toreadors, orange trees, a thousand fountains dancing in a sunlight.
You offer the Countess sunlight.
I offer her fierce midnights... and czardas and wild gypsies.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did someone say something?
There,
Your Majesty.
What is it?
Music here in my own forest?
- How dare they?
- I don't know, Your Majesty.
I want my stag!
It must be a band marching down the highway.
- Maybe it's an echo from the village.
- I want that band apprehended.
I will have them punished.
Every instrument, especially the brasses!
Your Majesty, may offer my profound apologies?
You may not!
- Oh, certainly not.
- Silence!
- Turn that thing off.
- Hi, Countess.
Turn it off immediately.
Now that I got him here?
You're crazy.
- Stop it, I tell you.
- You're gonna scratch my record.
You scared off the Emperor's stag.
They're combing the woods with loaded guns.
Let me demonstrate...
Did you find that band?
Not yet, Countess.
They must be hiding in the underbrush.
Who is this man?
A tourist picking strawberries.
What is that?
Well, that's what I was asking.
It's apparently for the strawberries.
How?
How. Oh-Oh, "how?"
Oh, why you... You put the strawberries in here... and then you grind them up with this, you see, and the jam collects down yonder.
This, uh, black platter...
You serve them n the platter.
The hole is for the juice.
Any other questions, please?
Yes. Will it work with gooseberries?
Gooseberries.
Great with gooseberries, huckleberries, strawberries, raspberries.
It's particularly smashing with raspberries.
You get the jam and the sound.
You see?
Go find the band.!
Yes, Countess.
Thank you, Countess.
You're a pip.
I'm a what?
A sweetheart. Put down that gun and have a chair.
I'm afraid you'll have to think up another scheme for your talking machine.
- Say, how's Scheherazade?
- She's much better.
- Too bad.
- What did you say?
I said "too bad".
Buttons and I were hoping she'd have a relapse and you'd have to come back.
That won't be necessary.
She's as gay as a lark.
Busy with her wedding plans.
Being trimmed, a new collar, sniffing over her wedding presents.
Is that right?
Buttons and I keep talking about you, night and day.
No sleep. No appetite.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
You don't suppose, do you, that that mental block business...
Now, could that be contagious?
Nonsense! Buttons is a sturdy, well-adjusted little dog.
Oh, I know Buttons is but I'm talking about me.
I'm the one that's got the shivers.
Don't laugh. One night there'll be a knock at your door.
When you come to open it,
Buttons will be standing there, with me in his arms.
Like you came with Scheherazade.
He'll put me down... and I'll lie there quaking all over, with my eyes rolled back until just the white is showing.
There'll be nasty gossip at the castle.
We'll sneak up the servant's stairs.
There I'll be, lying there in pitiable condition.
You'd have to help me then, wouldn't you?
How?
You'd bend over me...
You remember the cure we found.
I never sing.
Well, come on, force yourself.
Just hum a little, huh?
Countess Von
Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg.
Countess
Von Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg!
Good-bye.
Oh, wait, Countess, don't go.
Don't you feel it too?
Feel what, Mr. Smith?
Oh, that funny stir inside of you.
Those bubbles that start down in the tips of your toes and tingle up through your spine...
'til they reach your brain where they pop like a firecracker.
I know nothing about any such bubbles.
They're in your veins.
In your arteries.
They beat in your throat and pound in your ears.
What does, Mr. Smith?
Your blood. It's all out of whack.
It goes so fast and every which-way.
Mine's going counterclockwise.
How's yours?
Perfectly normal, I assure you.
I don't believe it.
Mine's the weak, watery different sort of blood.
You said so yourself.
In dreams I kiss your hand, Madame
 Your dainty fingertips
And while in slumberland, Madame
I'm begging for your lips
Go to sleep, Scheherazade.
Go to sleep.
Now, really!
Scheherazade, come back to bed.
Scheherazade!
Stop thinking about him.
He's just an ordinary little dog, like a million other little dogs.
All right, he has some charm and he knows some tricks, but he's not for you: he's not your sort.
I think I better give you a sleeping pill.
It'll relax you. Come on.
Come to bed.
Come on.
Get in.
That's a good girl.
Take this and lie down and go to sleep.
Oh, go to sleep, do.
Tomorrow you're going to be the most important dog in Austria.
You want to look your best.
Scheherazade, you're an adult, intelligent woman.
A little self control, a little dignity.
Is that too much to ask?
What would happen if we all let ourselves go?
Just make up your mind to this.
It cannot be.
Shut out every thought in that direction.
Fight it.
Suppress it.
In dreams I kiss your hand
 Your dainty fingertips
And while in slumberland, Madame
I'm begging for your lips
I haven't any right, Madame
 To do the things I do
Just when I hold you tight
 You vanish with the night
A fine pair we make.
Not another cold,
Your Majesty?
Certainly not.
The same one.
I might again suggest inhaling the vapor of pine needles.
No, Holenia, no.
Forty-15.
Any news from the kennels?
We took Scheherazade down after luncheon.
She asked me to thank Your Majesty for the bridal bouquet.
You've seen poodle puppies, haven't you, Holenia?
Charming little beasts.
Look as if they were made of black wool and licorice.
Good shot.
If I might be excused,
Your Majesty.
What is it? What's happening?
She's run away. She's gone.
It's a disgrace to our kennels.
Well, where is she?
I don't know. She just jumped over a 6-foot fence and disappeared.
That filthy animal!
I must inform His Majesty.
You will do nothing of the kind.
We mustn't disquiet the Emperor.
He has a cold.
Then what am I to do?
We'll catch her.
We'll bring her back.
You return to the kennels.
That's an order!
Yes, Baron.
Advantage, receiver.
Johanna.
The game.
Johanna.
Yes, Father?
We're in trouble.
What is it?
Scheherazade!
Scheherazade!
Scheherazade.!
Scheherazade!
Look at the silly beast!
Scheherazade.
Scheherazade.
Where's Scheherazade?
I don't know.
For heaven's sake, don't just lie there.
She's run away.
She must be with Buttons.
Where's Buttons?
Look at there. You threw me off.
What's your problem?
Where's Buttons?
- He isn't here.
- He's not? Where is he?
He got feeling so miserable
I put him out on the island.
What island?
Out here.
I'll show you.
He was unhappy, crying all night and everything...
I thought if I disconnected him from the mainland, put him on that island...
Look!
That idiot.!
That wonderful gal.
No mountain too high.
No ocean too wide.
Go it, Scheherazade!
- Oh, I hate you.
- The way, you say it, I don't mind it.
We've got to stop her.
Oh, forget her. Stick around,
I'll open up a bottle of glue.
I've gotta catch her and you're going to help me.
Wait a minute. Wait!
Johanna, what is it?
Where are you going?
Johanna!
Scheherazade!
Scheherazade!
Do you know how to row this thing?
Sure. I used to travel for a Venetian blind company.
Scheherazade!
 Santa Lucia
 Santa Lucia
 Scheherazade!
Scheherazade!
Johanna!
Johanna!
- Scheherazade.
- Hold it, Buttons. I'm a'comin'!
Oh, boy,
You're all mixed up here.
- He isn't hurt, is he?
- No, not him, he's too tough.
You kept telling me she didn't care, huh?
- Don't let him off that leash.
- Oh, don't worry.
Well, you've had your moment,
You lucky little coot.
It isn't every guy, has the lovely
Countess swim across a lake for them.
Stop trembling, Scheherazade.
I won't scold you. No.
I won't even mention it to anybody, ever. I promise.
What's that noise?
Oh, that?
That, uh, comes from the village.
You know, in the daytime they make violins, and in the evening, they fiddle.
Mighty pleasant, isn't it?
It's probably due to the echo.
Yeah. Like sittin' way up in the balcony, huh?
No, no, no, we must go back,
Scheherazade and I.
Well, then I'll...
I'll get Buttons ready for the night.
 You can say your lips
Are not for me
But you can't hide the kiss
That's in your eyes...
Would you mind not singing?
What was that?
I said, please stop singing.
Oh, sure.
What's a matter, Countess?
You afraid or something?
Afraid?
You know, this silly island, the silly sunset, all those fiddles
 tearing away, a man's voice.
You have to be more explicit.
But you needn't be afraid.
It's just that... sometimes sounds do funny things.
Now, you take a big chandelier, one of those high-class, well brought up chandeliers, and you hit a particular note,
 ping.
You make that chandelier tinkle all over.
Are you under the impression that your voice could, as you put it, make me... tinkle?
Well, yes, maybe, a little around the edges.
Who do you think I am?
Some half-witted shop girl... or some maudlin little waitress from a beer garden?
You're a chandelier,
Countess.
The loveliest chandelier
I ever saw.
Go on, sing!
Oh. No.
This is insulting.
Sing and sing at once!
 You can say your lips
 Are not for me
 But you can't hide the kiss
 That's in your eyes
 And you can say my arms
 Would only leave you cold
 But wait 'til they hold you
 And then look wise
 Yes, and you can say
 Tonight will come and go
 Without a single moment's worth of sighs
 But why should I agree
 When I know what will be
 It's plain to me
 Plain as the kiss
 In your eyes
Plain as the kiss...
Stop it!
I had a husband.
He was suave and distinguished.
He was dark and dashing.
He was six feet two.
He was the handsomest man in Austria.
You're so different.
Imagine, a thousand years of civilization crumbling because of a drummer's vocal chords.
- Isn't it utterly past belief?
- Aren't you a little harsh?
I remember once when
I was listening to Caruso.
Caruso is excusable, but that man's voice is...
A cheap bathroom yowl.
Ah, Therese, think of their nearness and the lake... and the fragrance of the summer night in the Tyrol.
Why begrudge them a moment of happiness?
Had it only stopped there.
But for two whole weeks they were having secret rendezvous on that island.
- The four of them.
- How shocking!
How divinely shocking!
Could I trouble you for another kiss, honey Countess?
No trouble at all.
I shall never forget you, Virgil.
Impertinent, unpardonable, ridiculous Virgil.
You bet you won't because I'm gonna be around to remind you.
You are?
I got it all worked out, honey Countess.
You pack Your bags. I pack mine.
We get the dogs. Take the first train, first boat, and then one day your folks... are gonna get a postcard from Newark, New Jersey.
It'll say, "Merry Christmas from
Mr and Mrs Virgil H. Smith."
It sounds so wonderful, and so impossible.
Oh, a few small problems.
A few? A million.
Where I come from, there's only one real problem:
Have you got two bucks for the licence, and two bucks I got.
Where I come from there are traditions and conventions... and family ties and responsibilities...
Oh, forget 'em, Countess.
We can't afford a scandal in my family.
I have a young brother.
By the grace of the Emperor, he's just been admitted to the Imperial Cadet School.
Good. So he'll hustle and get himself a job setting up pins in the
Imperial Bowling Academy.
I have a young sister, 17.
She's to be presented at court, her first great glamourous ball.
She'll call in the neighborhood kids instead.
She'll have herself a big taffy pull.
Then there's my father, very bankrupt and slightly dishonest.
If we affront the Emperor...
The Emperor, the Emperor...
- Nobody's that important.
- The Emperor is.
Why don't you tell him how things are with us, how we stand?
- That we're crazy about each other.
- Don't be naive.
All right then, let me talk to him.
You?
Why, sure! You just get me in there.
I'll tell him a thing or two.
You're not ashamed of me, are you?
Of course not.
Because I have no title,
I'm just a businessman?
No, it's impossible.
The Emperor wouldn't listen to you.
Even if he did, he wouldn't believe his ears.
I'll reason it out with him.
You don't reason with an emperor, darling.
You bow and listen to what he has to say and what he has to say is no.
It's always no.
And you bow again and leave.
Not me. I don't take no's.
I get my foot in the door and
I talk and talk and talk fast.
I'm a good salesman.
So I've noticed.
Come on, honey Countess.
Let me see him, huh?
I'm no saint. Heaven knows.
I'm no Puritan.
I've allowed my affections to get involved with the lower classes, more than once.
But I had some sense of proportion.
I love him, Father.
But at the proper time, I had the good taste to consign her regretfully to the garbage can.
I didn't put on a silver platter and present her to my emperor.
He doesn't accept our silly little prejudices.
He's better than we are.
Garbage! He's a cheap little drummer with some cheap business on his mind.
No, Father, with me on his mind, and a wonderful shining love.
Garbage!
Virgil.
Hello, Countess.
- He's waiting for you.
- Good. I'm ready myself.
- Now, don't be nervous.
- Look who's talking.
Hi!
Garbage.
What are you going to say?
I don't know, I'll do something.
I'll talk or play him a song or stand on my hands.
If he doesn't like me, maybe he'll like my associate.
He said 3 o'clock.
He's got a little cold, but I hope he's in a good mood.
Come in.
Step inside and bow from the waist and don't straighten up till he gives you the signal.
I got it. Come on, Buttons.
Keep your paws crossed.
I love you.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Who ever told me to try these nasty fumes?
Thank you.
You're quite welcome, I'm sure.
And my whiskers.
Just as I thought.
Now, they smell.
You could always shave them off, Your Majesty.
What was that?
Come here.
I think you'd look much nicer without all that... whipped cream.
An excellent idea.
They've bored me for the last 40 years.
Thank you, Your Honour...
I mean, Your Majesty.
Only it cannot be done.
Why not, Your Majesty?
Young man, if I were to shave off these whiskers,
Austria would be thrown into a state of turmoil.
Think what it would do to our stamps, our coins, our bank-notes.
I guess you're stuck, all right.
I'm glad you see my point.
Straighten up.
Who are you?
I'm the man who, uh...
Well, an appointment was made for me.
I was to be here at 3 o'clock
You are Mr Smith, the American.
Yes, Your Majesty.
It's in connection with the Countess
Von Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg.
Uh, what I want, Your Majesty...
Well, it's a hard for me to explain exactly what I do want.
Exactly what you want is the Countess Von Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg.
Exactly.
How long have you two known each other?
Three weeks, roughly speaking.
Not too roughly, I trust.
You love her, Mr Smith?
Yes, I do, Your Majesty. And she loves me.
I know it sounds crazy... considering who she is and where I come from, way, way the other side of the tracks.
It is somewhat unorthodox.
Should you marry Johanna, what kind of life do you envision?
Do you intend to live with her here in Vienna?
Move into her palace?
I should say not.
There's too many forks to know which one to pick up.
I plan to take her home with me.
Home?
Which one of the United
States do you come from?
New Jersey. Newark, New Jersey.
My mother has a place there.
A place?
That is, uh... an estate?
No, it's a house.
Sort of a half house.
Two family deal.
Dr. Coleman lives in the other half.
He's a dentist.
Nice fellow. We belong to the same bowling club.
You and Johanna will live with your mother?
Oh, yes. Wouldn't want her alone while 'm out on the road.
On the road?
Look, I could've come in here and thrown a big bluff, being a rich Wall Street man... just cruising around the world.
But actually, I don't have a yacht to my name.
I'm just a traveling salesman and I earn
$22.50 a week or 4 percent commission.
Which isn't bad when you consider what an up-and-coming product I handle.
That mechanical orchestra with which you pursued me from Vienna to that forest?
I'm sorry about the stag.
Oh, I probably would have missed him anyway.
I'm a very poor shot.
This machine...
Is it practical?
Is it, uh, really good?
Oh, that's the gosh darndest,
Jim-dandiest machi...
Listen, Your Majesty,
I didn't come here to sell that machine.
I came here to sell myself... so you wouldn't think the Countess was throwing herself away on a hoodlum.
You are not a hoodlum.
You are a businessman.
Yes, Your Majesty.
A good one, I'm sure: quick, clever, enterprising.
Thank you,
Your Majesty.
If a good proposition offered itself... you wouldn't let it slip through your fingers.
Oh, I should say not, sir.
Good. It so happens
I have one for you.
You have?
It's a very simple one.
Give up Johanna and I will endorse that machine.
Come again?
I'm sure you heard what I said.
Look, you,
I love her!
That, Mr Smith, is what I am counting on.
I'm not narrow-minded.
I could even forgive him being an American... if he belonged to one of those
Vander, Astor, or Rocker families.
But a Mr Smith!?
I love him.
- If you say that once more...
- I love him.
Garbage!
Father, if you say that once more...
I've seen these things happen before, Mr Smith.
I've seen them happen over and over again.
There was a grandniece of mine who ran away with a fencing master.
An archduchess who fell in love with a tourist guide in Egypt.
Princes have eloped with soubrettes, princesses with headwaiters.
And why not if they loved each other?
Why not?
Let me tell you why not.
My grandniece and her fencing master.
What happened?
A few beautiful months in Naples and then she began to want to go back to the life she left.
There's no going back.
Eventually, she threw herself from the 5th story window of her hotel.
The archduchess with her tourist guide had less luck, or less character.
She's living still... in a cheap
Viennese boarding house... on sleeping pills and brandy to forget where she came from.
Where she came from?
Because you're so much better than we are?
I don't say we are better.
As a matter of fact,
I think you are better.
You are simpler.
You are stronger.
Ultimately, the world will be yours.
You bet it will!
What I'm trying to explain,
Mr Smith, is that... we are different.
We are like snails living in lovely twisted little shells.
Have you ever observed a snail, Mr Smith?
They are majestic creatures... with small coronetted heads that peer very proudly from their tiny castles.
They move with dignity.
I imagine they have a great sense of their own importance.
But you take them from their shells, and they die.
- That is us, Mr Smith.
- Aw, that's a lot of...
I know my class.
Take Johanna with you and you destroy her.
Do you want to destroy someone you love?
I don't want to and
I'm not going to!
I'm gonna make her happy.
One chance in a million.
Bring that apparatus here.
I don't know whether she mentioned it... but there are two other offers for Johanna's hand... the Prince Baloshaza and the Marques Lafuente.
- And they're both idiots.
- I agree.
No chance of any wild love there.
But let's look ahead.
Picture Johanna in the two-family house in Newark.
Oh, she may still love you.
And yet as she dries the dishes, won't she think...
"Tonight, there is the gala opening of the opera in Vienna.
"Last week should have been at the races at Ascot in the Royal enclosure.
I wonder how the season is at Biarritz. "
She won't think that.
Because she has you?
That's right.
Are you enough,
Mr Smith?
Twenty-two fifty a week with a four percent commission.
Play it, please.
- Do you think I should go in?
- No, Father.
On hearing such a fantastic proposal,
I wager His Majesty fainted or had a stroke.
What's he playing music for?
Because everything's going so well.
Because His Majesty's listened to him.
And that song...
Tricking an old man into a sentimental mood.
It's not fair.
It's yes, it's yes.
It's yes!
The Emperor's cracking up.
Heaven help our poor monarchy.
Oh, monarchy, monarchy.
Crowns, titles, crests.
Who cares, Father? Who cares?
Well, don't just stand there,
Virgil, what happened?
What does that mean?
Is it all right?
All right? It's great.
Oh, it's great.
Do you hear that?
What did His Majesty say?
Oh, exactly what I wanted him to say.
Virgil!
I sure wanna thank you, honey Countess, both for myself and on behalf of the company.
Oh, it's all so wonderful.
What company?
The phonograph company.
My bosses.
They better send you a bathtub full of roses.
Me, why?
- I sold him a deal, didn't I?
- What deal?
I sold him the phonograph.
You sold him...
What's he talking about?
Hush, Father. Go on, please.
I knew I could sell him if
I could just get to him.
He's a wonderful old guy.
He fell for it like that.
He did?
Now it'll be a cinch.
Virgil H. Smith, by appointment to His Majesty, Franz Joseph I.
Who made that appointment?
My little honey Countess.
My mind isn't as quick as yours.
Let's be quite clear about this.
It was that phonograph from the very beginning?
Oh, come now, Countess.
What's a salesman after, first, last and all the time? A sale.
Of course. And everything that happened between us, all those words, those silly dreams, that was all part of what you call... a sales campaign?
I had a hunch you'd be a little sore, but... you couldn't have taken it seriously.
A Countess and a drummer, come on!
No, not really.
Only for a short time, perhaps, which makes me very stupid, or you a very good salesman, indeed.
The company thinks so. They send me on all the tough assignments.
It wasn't so tough, was it?
This is what you get for stooping so low.
You're right, Father.
The blood rushes to one's head and one gets a little dizzy... but I'm quite all right now.
- No hard feelings?
- No feelings at all.
It's so preposterous, it's funny.
It's nothing but funny.
You and that island and that nasty little dog, and my going to the Emperor for you.
It's funny and it's asinine and humiliating and a little disgusting, but it's mostly funny.
Not so funny as me taking a life-size countess to Newark.
- This is yours, I believe.
- So it is.
Come on, Buttons.
Good-bye, Countess.
His respectful regards to Scheherazade.
I never suspected that even garbage could be so cheap.
Don't you know us Americans?
Anything for a dollar.
Everything seemed so perfect with that dreadful man out of her life.
Johanna engaged to the Marques Lafuente.
Half a dozen castles.
Seven. The Lafuentes have more of everything.
Most of their children were born with 11 fingers.
And the poor American, what happened to him?
Poor? What's poor about him?
He made a gigantic success selling those machines by the thousands, the little worm.
Worm indeed.
By what possible right did he come to the Emperor's Ball?
Oh, why can't he leave Johanna alone?
What does he want from her now?
I wouldn't have broken into that ballroom if it wasn't a matter of life and death.
Mr Smith,
I am not interested.
Countess, after this you'll never see me again.
We're ready to go back home.
Only he'll never make it.
He'll never live to see America again unless you help us.
No.
He's out there in a sleigh, all bundled up.
You ought to see him.
Poor little rack of bones.
Hasn't slept in I don't know how long.
Won't eat.
Just lies there with his eyes like a couple of candles that are just about burned out.
I'm extremely sorry.
Last night he dragged himself out of the hotel.
You know where I found him?
Down in front of your house.
I rang the bell.
One of your servants told me
Scheherazade was at the Palace.
She cannot be disturbed.
What are you trying to do?
You trying to take it out on him for something I did?
Buttons isn't a businessman.
All Buttons did was to lose his fool heart.
One doesn't die of a lost heart, Mr Smith, except in those syrupy songs chambermaids play on your phonograph.
Aw, let him see her just once more.
Give them one moment together so the dog can breathe again.
You're not gonna let him die.
Let me go out to the sleigh and get him.
Release my arm, Mr Smith.
I'm expected back in the ballroom.
I forgot the word, maybe.
Please.
Please.
- Johanna, where have you been?
- What is it, Father?
It's Scheherazade.
Word's just come from the stables.
The veterinary says any moment.
Well, aren't you coming for the great event?
Of course, Father.
What are you doing here?
I thought I told you to wait for me and stay covered up.
She isn't here and you wouldn't want to see her.
Not anymore.
Take my word for it.
All right, you asked for it.
She took the other fellow after all, that royal stuffed shirt.
Seems at this very moment she's presenting him with a family.
Now, do you give up?
Here, Buttons.
Where are you going? Here!
Your Majesty.
Good evening, Dr. Zweiback.
Have they arrived yet?
Not quite yet, Your Majesty.
How is the patient?
Admirable. Temperature normal, pulse full, soft and regular.
We have no apprehensions.
I warn you, Dr Zweiback, I expect every care taken in the delivery.
They shall be ushered into the world with all the solicitude of which my hands are capable.
Stop that nonsense.
Go back to your patient.
If Your Majesty will excuse me,
I feel that I should be with her now.
What shall we call the little black things, Holania?
I've made a list of a few dark names.
For the first born,
I should suggest Othello.
For the second, perhaps Cafe Noir.
If he's very small,
Demi-tasse.
And if it's a female, Sheba.
Queen of Sheba, you know.
She was dark.
Simply inspired,
Your Majesty.
Hey, hey, Buttons.
Buttons.
Come on, Buttons, let's go home.
What do you got there?
What's the matter?
Quiet, darling.
How long, Dr Zweiback?
Not long at all, Countess.
Not an hour. Not a minute.
Not a second... because, Hocus-pocus, announcing the first arrival.
Your Majesty had promised
Rome to the Duke Von Bregens.
Oh, not definitely.
There's an interesting possibility in the Hague.
How so?
The puppies have arrived.
Well?
You've lost one of them?
No.
Are they deformed?
Have they got two heads?
- No.
- What is it?
Brace yourself,
Baron Holenia.
- No.
- Yes.
That blasted black Jezebel!
Father, please, don't. Not now.
Isn't there one of them that hasn't got so much white?
That's all there is, Baron.
Cursed. Cursed.
She can't do this to me.
She seems to have done it,
Father.
Your Majesty would like to know if there are any developments.
There are.
What is it, Holenia?
I was told to come here because it would happen at any minute.
When will it happen?
It has happened, Your Majesty.
It has? How many?
Three, Your Majesty.
Three? Is that all?
It's not many but I dare say it will have to do.
Where are my glasses?
I want to see them at once.
I don't think Your
Majesty should.
Why? Why shouldn't I see them?
Your Majesty, great grief has befallen us.
The puppies...
- Come, come, come.
- It was beyond my control, Your Majesty.
The puppies were born dead.
Dead?
One of those rare, unpredictable occurrences.
The expected mother must've had a fall.
Dead? All three of them?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Dead is such an ugly word.
We're bitterly sorry for Your
Majesty's disappointment.
How is Scheherazade?
She's recovering nicely, thank you, Your Majesty.
Poor Louis.
It will be quite a blow.
In this our moment of sorrow, may I venture to offer some consolation?
There will be other days.
She'll give us some puppies yet.
That's the way to look at it.
Come spring and we can count on another litter.
The question is, can I count on another spring?
If I may be permitted,
Your Majesty, it's almost 11:00.
What of it?
The ball, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty is to appear at 11:00.
His Majesty is in no mood for a ball.
You're quite right.
I'm in the mood for a cemetery.
Let us proceed to the ball.
Baron Holenia.
The puppies.
What about the puppies?
Didn't you hear? They're dead.
They are?
They must be.
Dead, buried, forgotten.
See to it at once.
That's an order.
All right, Andreas.
You heard the orders.
Cover up the head.
Hi!
May I come in or is it past visiting hours?
Who are you?
Get out of here!
Oh, aren't you being a little rude?
This little gentlemen is a very close relative.
Nobody's allowed in here.
Oh, well, he is.
Say hello to them.
Keep away from her.
Here, look out.
What are you doing?
Where are the pups?
Throw him out!
Wait a minute. Where are those pups?
What goes on here?
Orders have been given.
What orders?
What are you gonna do?
Get out of here!
Hold him.!
I flatter myself I handled the puppy situation rather well.
Do you think it's ever wise to lie to His Majesty?
The puppies are dead.
I gave orders.
Father!
You're not gonna kill 'em.
You're not gonna, understand?
I'm not gonna let you!
I don't care how many of you there are.
It's probably a good thing there are so many of you.
Maybe all of you can scrape up decency to lay off three little duffers who've just begun to breathe!
There not pure enough for you, huh?
Not quite your sort. Freaks!
Little mongrels you wouldn't have around!
So what are you gonna do?
You're gonna shake 'em off that great, big noble family tree... and let them rot as if nothing had happened!
What have you there,
Mr Smith?
Scheherazade's puppies, and you know it!
Baron Holenia...?
It seemed wiser.
I didn't want to shock Your Majesty.
Bring them here,
Mr Smith.
And as my hearing is not impaired, please do not shout at me.
Well, I wanted to get my two cents worth in, before YOU started talking.
Last time, like a chump,
I kept my mouth shut, remember?
Are we discussing the Countess
Von Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg or the contents of that basket?
Well, it amounts to the same thing.
Only now I know, with your very kind permission, that you were full of cracked ice!
Or maybe I was to fall for it and walk out and make a heel out of myself!
Virgil, will you say that again, please,
 slowly and plainly and simply?
Not now, honey Countess.
Your Majesty, was it me that you made him give up?
Yes, Johanna, yes.
We both agreed that with him, you had only one chance in a million to be happy.
Your Majesty thinks that I am happy?
Isn't one chance in a million better than no chance?
My dear, you're much too pretty for mathematics.
They're all boys.
That's right.
Boys run in Buttons' family.
This tiny one has a bite like a nutcracker.
They're sweet, Your Majesty.
They'll be the strongest, the smartest, the funniest...
And between Buttons and me, we'll bring 'em up right when we get 'em back home.
- Can I have 'em back now, sir?
- You cannot.
Why should you have Buttons, Johanna,
Scheherazade and the puppies?
Maybe we could leave one.
The one who's so attached to His Majesty's finger.
Sounds like a good deal.
I'd even be willing to withdraw the cracked ice crack.
I'm keeping them all.
Now leave me alone.
Go on, dance, all of you.
Your Majesty, if I may...
You may not, Holenia.
I will talk to you later.
Putzi, how do I look to you now?
I think the word is ravishing.
Shall we dance?
Love is a dream
 Yet it's so real
 Hard to explain
Just how you feel
 Deep in your heart
Joy seems to dwell
 Like poets say
 It's perfectly swell

Uncle Bill!
Uncle Bill! Uncle Bill! Here's your picture. Let us see it, Uncle Bill.
- Well, what do you know?
- What's it about, Uncle Bill?
- Well, look at this.
- Read it, Uncle Bill.
What does it say, Uncle Bill?
Why, it say, “Dear Bill:
Jim Europe would have been proud of you.”
Signed, “Ex-Drum Major,
Noble Sissle.”
Who's Jim Europe,
Uncle Bill?
Jim Europe? Why, he had the greatest band in the world-
Attached to the 15th Regiment.
Didn't I never tell you that?
No, Uncle Bill!
Why, we was under fire for 191 days straight.
Yes, sir! And our regiment was decorated with the Croix de Guerre.
You don't say,
Uncle Bill.
Why, children, I remember when we come back from France in 1918...
...the flags was flying, people were cheering.
- Boy, I'm looking out for us.
- What you got there?
Book of telephone numbers
I won from Joe.
Boy, I'm gonna promote us a couple of gals...
- ...for the ball tonight.
- How do you spell “us”?
- "US"
- You leave off the "S" and worry about you.
Every time you start to promotin', that spells trouble.
- And... hut!
- Here we go again.
- Did you go to the ball that night?
- We sure did.
- And did Gabe promote you a girl, Uncle Bill?
- No, he didn't,...
...but he promoted everything else...
...a girl for himself, a big limousine and a chauffeur.
We sure went there in style.
This must be General Pershing coming.
Can't be, because
General Pershing's a blond.
Well, boy, here we are, and I'm gonna Lindy Hop down.
Boy, I'm gonna carry on. Come on, honey.
Come back at 12:00, my man.
Come on, honey.
Yes, you.
Cousin Jake, what you want this time?
What you keep on calling me for?
I'm sorry, Gabe.
I can't come back and get you.
- Why?
- The boss wants to use the car at 7:00.
But, Cousin Jake, how we gonna get home?
How'd you get uptown from the ship this morning?
- Walked.
- Right there's your answer.
- I'm going to the powder room.
- All right, honey.
- Daddy, can I have a dollar for the maid?
- Huh? Oh, sure.
Sure, sure, honey.
Here you are. Here you are.
Right here.
Go ahead.
Man, you gonna brag yourself into the poorhouse yet.
Well, I ain't got far to go.
That just leaves $4.30 twixt me and it.
Hee-Hee!
I should have called one of them numbers in Joe's book for you.
You see, the trouble with you is-
What I mean is- when it comes to women, you just don't know, or else-
Man, you're ramblin'.
What hit you?
Look at that gal standing over there.
There's nothing like that in that book you was talking about.
It better not be.
Lieutenant Europe.
Well, well.
Selina Rogers.
Hello, Jim. it's nice to see you back.
I'm mighty happy to see you, honey.
And how you've grown up.
Say, Jim, I'm looking for
Clem's buddy, Bill Williamson.
- Can you point him out to me?
- I'm sure I can.
He's bound to be around here somewhere.
Come on. We'll find him.
- Okay.
- I hear that you're a big star now.
Yes, I'm doing nicely, thank you.
I used to tell you you'd get there someday. Remember?
You taught me my first song.
I'm still singing it too.
There's Bill Williamson now.
Private Williamson!
- Attention!
- Who, me?
My ears hear something, but my feet don't believe it.
Bill, this is Selina Rogers,
- Clem's little sister.
- Who's sister?
- Clem's.
- You don't mean Clem Rogers?
- Yes.
- My!
I didn't expect Clem's little sister to be so big.
You two get together. I've got to get on back to work.
- Okay, Jim.
- I'll see you kids later.
I'm glad to meet you, Bill.
Clem wrote me a lot about you.
He told me a lot about you too.
You know,
I was gonna look you up.
Here's something that he wanted you to have.
It's the Croix de Guerre for bravery.
Here I am, Daddy.
My, what a big cigar.
Yes, and a big man is smoking it too, honey.
Honey, I does everything in a big way.
It must have cost you a lot of money to keep that oar and chauffeur while you were at war.
Chicken feed, honey, just chicken feed.
- You must be powerful rich.
- Oh, I got a little. I got a little.
- Gardenias. Twenty-five cents.
- Yes, indeed.
Nothing too good for the little lady.
Yes. My daddy does everything in a big way.
- Give me all of 'em.
- All of 'em?
I sure go for a guy that's free with his money.
Do you, honey?
- That'll be $3.00.
- Huh?
It was very nice of you to tell me all this about Clem.
Oh, that's all right.
- You wanna dance, Selina?
- I'd love to, soldier.
Ooh, I never expected to have so many flowers till I was dead.
Let's dance, Daddy.
No, come on. Let's sit down.
Waiter, table for two.
I've been marching all day.
Anyway, there ain't no point in dancing.
- What are you gonna drink?
- What you got?
- Just ginger ale and root beer.
- What?
You positive you ain't got nothing but ginger ale and root beer?
- That's all we got.
- This is gonna spoil my whole evening,...
...'cause back in Paris, I didn't drink nothin' but champagne-...
...the best of champagne.
Well, now, maybe I'd be able to fix you up with a bottle of that.
I got a friend on the outside.
- But it'll cost you plenty of money.
- Oh, that's all right.
- Money's no object to us. Is it, Daddy?
- Well, no.
- I'll see what I can do.
- Uh, yeah, here, boy. Come here. Come here.
Don't knock yourself out. it ain't that important.
Oh, he don't mind. I always wanted to taste that stuff.
Well, honey, if you never tasted it, it might make you dizzy.
- That's what it's for, ain't it?
- I'll do my best.
But- Wait-
I sure hope I'll be able to walk out of here without any trouble.
Me too.
- Aw, that was swell.
- I want you to meet Gabe.
- Who's Gabe?
- Why, he was Clem's other buddy.
There he is, right there.
Come on over.
You know, they called us the
Three Musketeers of the AEF.
Meet Selina Rogers,
Clem's sister.
I'm mighty proud.
This is Miss Cynthenetta Webb.
Say, this buddy of yours is a sharp dancer.
He ought to be on the stage.
Ought to be on the stage?
Oh, by the way, Bill, I had the booking office on the phone this afternoon.
Looks like you gonna play the
Palace week after next, boy.
- Then you are on the stage.
- Why-
Yes, and he's his manager.
He's gonna put me on the stage too.
- Really?
- Well, I don't usually bother with amateurs,...
- ...but in this case-
- Oh, Gabe, why don't you come up for air?
Now, listen to him. The most modest man in the whole world.
Oh, let him go on, Bill.
I'd like to hear more about you.
You only got to ask anybody in show business.
Take Bud Williams-
He's crazy about Bill and me.
Oh! Then you must know Chick Bailey.
Chick Bailey?
Do we know Chick Bailey?
Why, we put him in show business.
- We're just like brothers, ain't we, Bill?
- Sure.
Ladies and gentlemen, presenting Miss Selina Rogers, one of our newest stars.
- Well, here's where we break in the new song, Selina. - Okay.
Miss Webb, Bill Williamson,...
- ...this is my partner, Chick Bailey.
- How do you do?
- You know Gabe, of course.
- Gabe?
- Come on.
- Who'd she say?
He heard her-
Chick Bailey.
The guy he put in show business- his brother.
- But, honey, I can explain everything.
- Don't explain nothing to me.
- I can see through it. The nerve.
- But, baby-
- Trying to pull a trick like that.
- Well, honey, I was only-
And after all you done for him.
Why, the ingratitude.
Trying to make out like he didn't even recognize you.

But I like this better.
Hmph. Here comes that
Mr. Chick Bailey again.
- Gee, Selina, you were swell.
- Thank you.
Say, waiter, same thing all around.
- And the party's on me, so see that
I get the check. - Oh, yes, sir.
Oh, I wouldn't want you to do that.
Oh, that's nothing. it's a pleasure.
Well, I wouldn't argue over trivialities.
How long you gonna stay in New York, Bill?
- I gotta leave town tonight.
- That's an excellent idea.
You see, I've got my old job waiting for me down in Memphis.
Oh, but with the talent you've got, you should be a dancer.
Oh, I only know a few steps
I picked up myself.
Yes, but you could work at it and learn.
Couldn't he, Chick?
Sure. They even teach elephants to dance.
Ladies and gentlemen,...
...the Cake Walk.
Everybody join in!
Come on, Selina. Let's try and win this cake.
- But this is our dance.
- Tonight's the army's night, Chick.
Wait a minute, waiter.
Come on. Let's dance, honey.
- But you said there was no point in dancing.
- But there is now, baby.
Why, you big blow-off.
Trying to show my daddy up.
But you ain't foolin' nobody. Hmph!
- We got your number.
- Your check, sir.
Clem never told me you could sing like that, Selina.
I couldn't when Clem went away, but I practiced, and I studied.
I've always been ambitious.
Haven't you, Bill?
Never have been, except to get three square meals a day, regular.
But I'm beginning to see things different now.
- Sorry you're going away, Bill.
- Oh, I'll be back.
- When?
- Oh, when I get to be somebody.
Man, there ain't nobody in the world can get me on my feet again until we hit Memphis-...
- ...unless'n this boat sinks.
- I'm tired too.
And if I never see a bale of cotton no more in life...
...that'll be too soon.

- Just saw Chick Bailey.
- Chick Bailey from Chicago?
Yes. Been playin' in New Orleans.
Just stopped on his way through.
Comin' down Beale Street with a big party.
Says he wants to put Fats for his new show at the Pickens Theater.
Fats, you's now on your way to fame and fortune.
Boys, smarten up. Let's put the best-lookin' one in front.
- That's me.
- All right.
So we can see the lighting effect in the drum.
Hey, Ada, do I look better with the hat on or with it off?
With or without, man, you leaves me cold.
- Bill!
- Yeah?
Those tables- push them together.
Here they come.
I wish somebody would book me someplace.
- Hey, Chick Bailey.
- Hello, Ada.
Nice table right here for you.
Round of drinks, and the best in the house.
Well, Ada, let's hear that band of yours.
All right, Fats, go to work.
Well, all right then, boys, latch on! Come on.

Why don't you fold up this joint?
You know, I could use you in the show too.
- You could?
- Sure could.
Oh, boy! This joint is folding as of Saturday night.
What?
- Guess you're out of employment again.
- Hee-Hee!
You hired and I'm fired.
I'm going to tell Fats.
- Aren't you Bill Williamson?
- Huh?
Sure you are.
- Hello, Selina.
- Gee, I'm glad to see you.
- What are you doing down here?
- Dancing.
But on account of the bartender being sick, the cook had to take the bartender's place, the waiter took the cook's place, and I had to take the waiter's place.
- Gee, I'd love to see your act, Bill.
- Oh, waiter.
Bring me another pack of cigarettes, will ya?
- Yes, sir, boss.
- Say, Chick.
I want you to do me a favor.
I want you to put Bill in the show.
- Doing what?
- He's a terrific dancer.
But, Selina, dancers are a nickel a dozen.
Maybe so, but he was Clem's buddy, and I want to help him if I can.
- All right, Selina. He's in.
- Aw, thanks, Chick.
Bill, how soon can you leave for Chicago?
I'm on the outskirts of Peoria right now.
- Chicks gonna put you in the show.
- Sure enough?
Yep. I've got just the spot for you.
I'm gonna put you right on top.
And did he put you on top,
Uncle Bill, like he said?
Mm-hmm. He put me on top, all right.

Gee, Selina, you were wonderful.
- How about a sandwich after the show?
- That sounds swell to me, Bill.
- I'd love to.
- Okay. I'll see you later.
- It's a date.
- But you can't, Selina.
I don't want her seen around those cheap lunchrooms.
- Don't be like that, Chick.
- But it isn't good for the show,...
...and I'm running the show.
Yes, but after the show is over,
I do as I please.
Well, we'll see about that.
If you're thinking what's good for the show, why don't you let me go out and do my dance?
What? Let you do your cheap hoofing in a classy show like this?
Why, they'd walk out on you.
Listen, Mr. Big Shot.
The only reason they ain't walking out on you is because it's raining out.
Yeah? Well, if you want to stay in this show, just do your stuff on the drums, that's all.
Just do your stuff on the drums.
That's just what I'm gonna do.

Boy, I've never known that number to go better.
It was swell.
You were terrific.
Come in.
- Well, he fired me.
- Yes, I know.
But I don't care. You know, I just had to do it, Selina.
Well, I don't blame you, Bill.
If it wasn't for making trouble for you,
I'd hang a sign on that guy's eye- “closed for the season.”
Well, don't let me stop you. Does that invitation to a sandwich still go?
It sure does.
The lunchroom?
Ah, that sounds like a great place to me.
Come in.
Say, didn't I tell you to get out of my theater?
And didn't I tell you I'd get out when I get good and ready?
- Well, you're ready now.
- That's right.
Ready, willing and able.
Come on, Selina.
One never knows, do one?
That's just like Chick.
He ain't changed a bit.
What happened after you socked him, Uncle Bill?
Oh, we had our ups and downs- more downs than ups at first.
- Did you keep on dancing? - Sure. That's when I invented that Bill Williamson step.
- You remember that, don't you, honey?
- Yes.
Come on. Let me see if you can do it.
You ready? Go.
Why, you haven't forgotten it.
You did that fine.
- What's this?
- Well, well. Look at this.
It looks like Gabe is still out of money.
- Just like my old man.
- Hee-Hee!
What happened to Gabe,
Uncle Bill?
Oh, we kind of lost track of him for a few years.
- Did he quit promotin'?
- Well, he did and he didn't.
You see, I was trying to open a show in New York... and having a peck of a lot of trouble about money.
I was walking down the street in Harlem that day.
- No, it ain't.
- Yes, it is.
Well, I'll be doggone.
- How you doin', partner?
- Well, I ain't doin' so bad.
- Thank you. - Imagine me comin' up here for a shine and finding you here.
Get right on up there,
'cause this one's on the house.
- Lord, I been reading about you.
- Yeah?
Yeah. Funny thing, I was coming down to catch the show tonight...
...and comin' back and ask for you.
Oh, man, it don't look like it gonna be no show.
- How come? - All the chorus girls ganged up and refused to work...
- ...unless'n they get paid for last week's rehearsal. - What?
But if I could get open tonight,
I'd be out in front.
- Well, how much money do you need?
- I need exactly $560.
Ain't you got that much in the box office?
No, that's been attached for the costumes and scenery.
Well, buddy, if that's all that's worrying you, your worries is over.
You got yourself a new agent.
You mean to tell me you got $560?
No, I ain't got 560 cents, but I got a idea.
I got ideas too, but what I need is money.
Now, you listen to me.
If you look prosperous and sweet-talk them gals, they'll be so busy figuring out how to make you spend what they think you got... that they ain't got no time to worry about how much money you ain't got.
- Gabe, what are you driving at?
- Just leave that to me. Leave it to me.
You just go on back down to that theater...
...and tell them gals that Gabriel the angel is coming.
You ain't gonna have no trouble stalling them gals, is you?
Oh, no. I'll see you. All right, buddy.
I'll be out-
- My room rent is due!
- I need cash money.
All you keep doing is flapping your big mouth.
- You say too much and you do too little.
- Girls, girls, girls.
Listen. The angel is on his way, and he'll be here any minute.
Oh, we've heard that before.
I guess that's old Gabriel blowing his horn now.
Might be.
- Gabe!
- Evening, William.
- Shake hands with Mr. Miller.
- Mr. Miller.
Girls, this is your new boss,
Mr. Gabriel Tucker.
- He's even got an angel's name.
- But he doesn't look the part.
- All right, everybody, inside.
This way, Gabe. - Okay, Willie..
- Wait a minute.
- Where's the money?
Ladies, after all, let's do this in a businesslike manner.
- Let's proceed, William.
- How do you like that?
- Can you imagine?
- Well, what about-
- He looks like ready money. - Well, let's take a chance. We ain't got nothin' to lose.
Okay.
Come on, girls.
I've seen that guy somewhere before.
Yeah?
Come on, girls. Mr. Tucker has something to say to you.
Ladies, I understand that there's a little matter of back salaries, which I am here to clear up.
- That's right.
- Providing, of course-
If I can see a little sample of what I'm putting my money into.
Maybe I could give you an idea.
Vamp me, Professor.
Vamp me.

Ladies of the ensemble,
I have decided to personally guarantee the money that's coming to you all.
You will find your pay envelope at the stage door as you pass out tonight.
And henceforth, you will all receive a five-dollar raise.
Why, it's Gabe, isn't it?
Hello, Gabe.
- Oh, Selina, oh.
- Selina, come here a minute, honey.
I got something to tell you confidentially.
Just a minute, Bill. I hardly recognized you in those clothes.
- Yeah, it's been a long time.
- Oh, I should say it has.
Not since the night of the ball in New York, when you pretended you knew Chick Bailey.
Yeah, that was funny, but don't let me detain you.
Come on, honey.
You got to get dressed.
Oh, and that big limousine, remember?
Bill and I've laughed about it a hundred times.
- Haven't we, Bill?
- Yeah. Yeah.
Boy, call a half-hour.
But, Mr. Williamson, we've got an hour yet.
Listen, call a half-hour now, and call it loud.
All right. I'm calling it.
Bill always said if you didn't have a nickel to your name, you'd still-
- Half-hour! Half-hour.
- Come on, Selina. it's half-hour.
- But my watch must be slow.
- It sure is.
I know I've “seed” that guy someplace before.
- Yeah? Where?
- I don't know.
The face is familiar, but I can't recollect the surroundings I “seed” it in.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Was it a poolroom?
- No, no.
- I thought it might give you a cue.
A barbershop?
No, no.
Say, Cousin Jake, do me a favor, please.
- Well, what?
- Run outside and get me a box of candy.
- Candy?
- You know, somethin' big and fancy.
- Well, how big and how fancy?
- Well, do the best you can with three bucks, hear?
Uh, okay, okay, okay.
Let me outta here before this thing blows me to pieces.
- What's wrong with it?
- I d-
- Where'd you have it fixed?
- I just had it worked on!
- Who worked on it?
- The man that's got the garage around-
Well, he ain't no good.
The man you want is the man-
I had him!
He the one that ruined it!
Well, I see you got plenty water, but is you outta gas?
No, 'Tain't that. I think maybe it's-
- Oh, it couldn't be that.
- Well, there ain't much wrong with it.
What you need is some of them new gadgets.
You know, the kind that you buy-
- I just bought some.
- Oh, not them.
I mean the kind what fastens where they fits.
- A whole dozen'll cost about-
- That's too much money.
I can't afford it. I got to get some that don't cost no more-
You can't get 'em that cheap.
Well, we can get the car fixed up good maybe for around-
No, what you need...
- ...is a new car.
- Yeah.
The kind like my uncle had.
He made a trip out there where-
- Did he go out there?
- Sure!
I thought all the time he was gonna go-
He did, but not that time.
Well, what's he doin' now?
Well, since he been back, he's been very busy gettin' ready for what he thinks-
- Is that so?
- Sure.
- Well, I guess like all bachelors, he's-
- No, no. Not him.
- He gonna get married.
- He is?
Yeah, he's gonna marry the widow whose husband used to be-
- She's a fine lady.
- Mm-hmm.
But listen.
- I heard that one time she-
- That was her daughter.
- Oh.
- You see, I'm keeping company with her.
- You is? - Yeah, I been engaged to her ever since the time-
- I didn't know you knowed her that long.
- Sure!
I worked with her brother. And one day on the job, the first thing I know-
That was your fault. Now, what you should have done was-
- I did!
- You see that?
- Now, that's why I like talk to you.
- Yeah.
'Cause me and you seem to agree with one another.
Sure!
You know one thing?
When I get the car fixed up,
I'm gonna take you and your girl out for a ride sometime.
- That'll be great. Can you make it on next... - I'll be busy then.
- When can you make it?
- Let's see. The best day for me will-
That suits me.
What hour?
- Anytime between...
- That's a little early, but we'll be there.
- All right, I'll be seein' ya.
- Later. Bye-bye.
Bon-
Bon “vorage.”
Bon “vorage.”
That was awful nice of you, honey, to promise us the raise in salary.
Oh, that's trivial, honey, trivial.
- I might even split my profits with you.
- Really?
Wonderful.
Oh, that's my man.
Now, don't go away.
I'll be right back in a second.
Right back in a second.
Oh, that's swell.
What- All of this for three bucks?
Uh, the candy may be a little stale, but it's a nice box.
Thank you. Thank you, Cousin Jake.
Thank you.
- Isn't he wonderful? - Edna Mae, I believe you've taken a shine to that angel.
- Shine? Did you say shine?
- Yes.
Doggone it.
I know I saw him somewhere.
- He's a bootblack.
- Who?
That angel. He ain't no angel.
He's got a shinin' stand in Harlem.
- He shined my shoes a thousand times.
- What? A bootblack?
- Come on, kids.
- I'm so mad, I don't know what to do.
Listen, girls!
This is me, kiddies. Gabe.
I've got a surprise for you.
Come in, deary. We've got a surprise for you too.
All right, honey.
Now, here is somethin' for you.
Now, this is-
Now, stop-
- What's the matter? What's wrong?
- I don't know.
Girls! Girls! Just a minute!
What are y'all trying to do?
What's the trouble in here?
They can hear you out front.
There's plenty of trouble. We're not going on till we get our money!
But, girls, you've got to finish the show.
If I have to give the people their money back tonight, I will be ruined.
- I'm ruined now.
- He reminds me of-
No. He looks worse than that.
If it's money you all are worried about, I think I have the solution to your problem.
Cousin Jake, where did you get all that money?
Uh, I drove my boss to Belmont Park today.
- You mean, there was a coincident?
- What you mean?
That the right horse came in at the right time... and on the right track at the right odds?
- Uh, yeah!
- As we live and breathe!

When did you go to
Hollywood, Uncle Bill?
Honey, the first time
I went to Hollywood was 1936.
- Did Miss Selina go with you?
- No, she didn't go.
- How come? - When two people can't seem to see the same thing the same way,...
...life just gets powerful complicated.
You see, honey, this is the living room,...
...here's your room, and this is the nursery.
Oh, that's swell, Bill. That's about the prettiest little house I ever saw.
- But not for us.
- Why not for us?
You know why not for us. We're show people, on the road day in and day out.
We don't have time to live in a house like that.
Sure, that's the way it's been up until now, honey. But-
Oh, but, Bill, we've been over this a thousand times.
I know, but since I've got that Hollywood contract, we'll have plenty of money.
- You won't have to go on workin'.
You can quit. - Quit?
Sure. You worked long enough. it's time that you settled down.
And we have a home and-
But, Bill,
I don't wanna quit.
I wouldn't be happy unless
I went on with my work, just like you.
Singing's in my blood.
I'm sorry, Selina. I just thought maybe you'd see it different now.
Bill, I'm afraid I'll never see it differently.
Never.
I'm sorry too.
Selina- then she went to Paris and got to be a big star over there.
Didn't Miss Selina ever come back, Uncle Bill?
Not yet.

You've just heard some words and music written by Rodgers and Hart.
This is the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer sound stage number one.
In this film, Mickey Rooney will portray Larry Hart, or Lorenz Hart, as the song sheets read, and I am Richard Rodgers.
If in telling you about Larry
I talk quite a bit about myself, it's because there hasn't been a day in my life that didn't have something to do with Larry Hart.
I'm almost sorry to say there were none of the standard trials and tribulations you'd ordinarily expect.
In fact, we were just two lucky fellows who had success very young.
From a dramatic standpoint, we didn't even have the advantage of being very poor.
We weren't very rich, either.
When I first met Larry, he had already acquired quite a reputation at Columbia University as a poet and wit, and I was a little scared.
Anyhow, one day Herb Fields, a mutual friend of ours who later wrote the books for some of our shows,
arranged a meeting.
- Is this it?
- Yep.
Maybe we ought to come back some other time.
- Oh, relax, will you?
- Yeah. But you think...
Look, you wanna do a show with him, don't you?
- Oh sure, sure.
- All right, then.
Meet him, play a couple of songs and you're in.
- Hi, Herb.
- Hi, Larry.
- Come on in.
- Thanks.
Larry, I'd like to have you meet Dick Rodgers.
You know, the fellow I was telling you about.
Oh, hiya, Dick.
Heard a lot about you.
You're the fellow who writes music, eh?
- Well, I...
- Come on in. Make yourself at home.
You hungry? Want something to eat?
How about some nuts?
- Oh, no. Thanks.
- Apples? Oranges?
- How about a piece of coffee cake?
- No...
Corned beef sandwich? I'll send out, get a corned beef sandwich.
- No, thanks very much, anyway.
- Smoke? Cigar?
- Light ones? Dark ones?
- I never use them.
How about you, Herb? That's right.
You don't smoke, do you?
Go ahead.
Play something.
Go ahead.
Hey, hey, Herb, I got a new rhyme for you.
What rhymes with Coolidge?
- Coolidge?
- Yeah.
- Nothing rhymes with Coolidge.
- You wanna bet?
- Coolidge?
- Sure, say it over to yourself.
Coolidge, Coolidge, Coolidge.
Come on, quick.
Oh, I'm ashamed of you.
When you speak of Coolidge, he deserves a eulogy.
Coolidge he, eulogy.
Hey, that's very good, Larry.
That's all.
Herb, did you read this article yet?
- No, I didn't.
- It's not bad at all.
Operator, give me Trafalgar 4599, please.
Hello, Jack? This is Larry Hart.
Have you got that book of Heine's in yet?
No, no, no. Not the translation.
That was the later edition.
Yeah, will you look around please?
Hey, that's not bad at all.
Hello? You have? Jack, you're a doll.
Yeah, yeah, right away. Yeah.
What does he do now?
Shoot himself out of a cannon?
Say, that's a pretty elaborate musical phrase, isn't it?
- Well, it's a...
- Not that it bothers me, you understand.
I gotta go pick up a book.
I'll talk to you later, Herb.
Go ahead. Keep playing.
He liked it.
Oh, sure, I could tell he liked it.
He did everything but card tricks.
- Now, Dick...
- No, brother, I've seen everything.
Here I sit at this piano, and this nutcracker...
But, Dick, he's always like that.
- Mrs. Hart. How are you?
- Hello, Herb.
Well, introduce me to this nice young man.
- This is Dick Rodgers.
- I'm very happy to meet you, Mrs. Hart.
- That was you playing the songs?
- Yes.
- You wrote them?
- Well, sure. He's a real composer.
Isn't that nice?
You know something?
I like your songs and your playing, very much.
Well, thank you, Mrs. Hart.
Here, what am I standing here for?
Have a bite.
For quite a while, I didn't hear from Larry and it began to look as though
neither my tunes nor I had scored much of a hit with Mr. Hart.
I stuck with it.
But, believe me, a tune without a lyric is a mighty lonesome thing.
Hello.
Oh, hello, Herb.
Yeah?
- What?
- Yeah, yeah, you heard me.
- He's crazy about the songs.
- Yeah, he's crazy all right.
No, no, not just crazy.
He's crazy about the music.
I haven't heard from him in two weeks.
- He wrote a lyric.
- A lyric?
A lyric. You know, words.
Be there at 5:30 sharp.
And don't be late, please.
Okay, fine. Goodbye.
5:30 came, 5:30 went.
And I got my first introduction
to something I soon learned
I could count on,
the business of waiting for Larry.
- Now don't worry. He'll be here.
- So he's crazy about it, huh?
I tell you, the guy called me and he was jumping through the telephone.
Hi, Herb.
Morn! Morn! Mary!
Herb, have you seen the September issue of Vanity Fair?
- The what?
- No, I can tell you haven't seen it.
- What is it, dear?
- Mom, have you seen
the September issue of Vanity Fair?
- No, I haven't.
- Mary, what have you done with it?
You know I don't read that stuff, Mr. Larry.
Can we find it, please? Can we find it?
It's getting so you can't find anything in this house anymore.
- Hi, Dick.
- Hi, Larry.
Play that first thing for me, will you?
- What thing?
- You know.
- Hey, I got a new rhyme for you.
- Yeah?
Yeah, what rhymes with tapestry?
- Tapestry?
- Half-past three. Please.
I found it in your room, Mr. Larry.
Oh, good. Boy, you're wonderful.
You're a doll.
- Listen, get me something to eat, will you?
- It's near suppertime.
There's some knockwurst and salami in the packages there.
Cut some up, please.
Here we are. Here we are.
That's it. There you are.
Manhattan.
- You like Manhattan?
- Manhattan? Yeah, yeah, I like Manhattan.
Manhattan.
We've got Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island, too
It's lovely going through the zoo
You know the rest. Go ahead. Play it, Dick.
Summer journeys to Niagara
And to other places aggravate all our cares
We'll save our fares
I've a cozy little flat in what is known as old Manhattan
We'll settle down
Right here in town
We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island, too
It's lovely going through the zoo
It's very fancy on old Delancey Street, you know
The subway charms us so
When balmy breezes blow to and fro
And tell me what street compares with Matt Street in July
Sweet pushcarts gently gliding by
The great big city's a wondrous toy
Just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy
I'd like to take a sail on Jamaica Bay with you
And fair Canarsie's lakes we'll view
The city's clamor can never spoil
The dreams of a boy and girl
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy
Well, it's nice, but a bit off the beaten track. I'm sorry.
But when you're riding the crest of youth,
you don't get easily upset, even by turndowns.
Larry, in particular, was tireless, and his enthusiasm was boundless.
This kind of netter-sireiter writing, singing, demonstrating went on for two years.
But nothing happened.
They aH thought the songs were fresh, different, engaging,
but nobody bought them.
And after a while, this gets monotonous.
After two years, it can get desperate.
Finally, when I felt
I couldn't take it any longer,
I had a talk with my father.
Can I help, Richard?
What would you say if I told you
I were giving up being a composer?
I'd say all right, if I could think of a good reason, but just offhand I can't think of one.
Well, I'll give you one. Nothing happens.
Two years, almost three and I'm nowhere.
- Where do you want to be?
- What's the sense of kidding, Pop?
You've been carrying the freight too long.
College, Academy of Music, and now this.
Months and months of knocking our brains out.
Nobody cares.
I think you've written many good things.
Sure, and they can't even get me a cup of coffee.
Well, Richard, the coffee will come.
Maybe you have to boil it a little more.
- No, it's no good. I'm going into business.
- Business? Doing what?
Selling infants' wear.
How did you happen to select this vocation?
Well, a friend of mine offered me $50 a week to start.
Well!
I never knew you were so interested in getting $50 a week.
- Do you need $50?
- What I need is self-respect.
Well, you sound desperate.
Gee, Pop. It's not only living off you.
But I'm getting so
I'm envious of everyone.
A counterman, a taxi driver, a shoe shiner.
Anybody who can earn anything.
Richard, I went through four years of college, two years of med school, interned for two more years.
And just about that time,
I was in the same place as any kid leaving grammar school, except I had a slight added handicap.
I was also in love with your mother.
Sol can only tell you, Son, just keep writing those nice songs.
Work with Larry.
Dream a little longer, and work a little harder.
Be a little patient.
No, it's no good, Pop.
I've made up my mind.
Well, nothing better for a man than to finally know exactly what he wants to do.
So, I guess that's the way it's gotta be.
Hope you don't think
I'm running out on you, Larry.
Don't be silly.
Of course, it is quite a switch from musical comedy, but I think the diaper business is a good business.
Want something to eat?
Something to drink? Cigar?
- No, thanks.
- That's right, you don't smoke, do you?
Let's have a party. Want to have a party?
It's an occasion. Might wind up the greatest party we ever had.
A farewell party.
Farewell to the maestro of music and a welcome to the mogul of baby clothes, huh?
Come on, now.
Look out. Hot coffee.
Hot coffee coming through.
Harry, how about you? A little coffee, boy?
That's right. Just fresh made.
- Hey, Larry, how about some more coffee?
- It'll stunt your growth.
No, I'm sorry.
In that corner you get no coffee.
- Good evening, Mr. Eddie.
- Hi, Mary. How are you?
- Fine.
- Miss Grant. Miss McNeil.
- Hello, Mary.
- Good evening. May I take your wraps?
- Hey, a party.
- Now, Mr. Eddie.
- Hey, Eddie. Hi!
- Hi, everybody. Hi!
- Hey, hi, baby. Where you been?
- Auditioning.
- Tough year for singers, you know.
- It's a tough year. Period.
Or maybe not. Will you have some coffee?
- Thanks.
- Let's assume this is for you.
Look, this is my house.
Don't I get to meet the...
Oh, sure, sure.
Everybody gets to meet everybody.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I want you to meet two protégées of mine,
Miss Margo Grant and Miss Peggy McNeil.
Say, Herb, you know Eddie Anders, of course?
Of course. May I say there's no one I'd rather hear sing?
- Well, how about a song now, huh, kid?
- Oh, not now. Later maybe.
What I really want is for you to hear this one.
She sings, too? What are we waiting for?
Gee, let me catch my breath.
A little later maybe.
What is this, singers want to sing a little later, maybe?
Come here, honey. I want to talk to you.
- You're a singer, too?
- Well, not exactly. I dance.
Yes, of course.
May I say there's no one I'd rather dance with?
- Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah.
-"Ah-ah, ah-ah," what?
This one is for the boy.
- Tell me all about yourself.
- Well, there's really not much to tell.
That's a wonderful song.
I'm glad you like it.
I had no idea it was that good when we wrote it.
- Oh, are you...
- Larry Hart. Yeah, I wrote the words.
Really?
- Do you sing for a living?
- Kind of. I work in a café.
It's really a Speakeasy.
- Have you been here long?
- No. I'm hot out of Boston.
- Have you ever been in a show?
- A couple.
Why? Are you looking for someone for a show?
Because if you are, they call me "Available" McNeil.
No, honey. We're looking for a producer.
- You know any?
- Producers?
- What are they?
- Yeah.
I never got past the elevator boy.
Well, if either one of us ever find a producer to produce our show,
I'll bet you'd be wonderful in it.
You mean me?
I'll bet you'd be the best thing in it.
- Shall we dance?
- Yeah. Sure. Come on.
So you're a little fellow, aren't you?
But on you, it's very becoming.
That's another song from our un-produced show.
I know and I love it.
- You do?
- Eddie taught it to me.
Well, what are we waiting for?
Excuse me just a minute, will you, honey, please?
Thank you. Pardon me, Dick. Everybody.
From the un-produced works of Rodgers and Hart,
Miss Peggy McNeil is going to sing an unknown song entitled
There's A Small Hotel.
Miss McNeil, Mr. Rodgers.
Mr. Rodgers, Miss McNeil.
- How do you do?
- I hope you all like it. You're on, honey.
There's a small hotel
With a wishing well
I wish that we were there
Together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete far us ta share
Together
Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people
Who wants people?
When the steeple bell
Says, "Good night, sleep well"
We'll thank the small hotel
We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel
Together
- How about that, Herb?
- Oh, that was great.
You really got something here, Eddie.
- You do sing awful good, Peggy.
- It's an awful good song.
There's another one.
We've got a million of them.
And I'll bet you could sing them all.
Wouldn't it get kind of monotonous, me singing all those songs?
No, honey, not to me it wouldn't.
Peggy, how tall are you?
I don't know. About 5'4", I guess.
That's what I figured.
There we are.
- What is this?
- I'm filing you away for future reference.
This is Dick, he's 6', this is Herb, this is my mother.
This is a little girl named Helen and this is the milkman.
I don't think I quite understand.
You will, after you've known me
10 or 15 years.
Larry! Larry! Larry! Dick!
Look, you know what happened?
It's the darnedest thing.
Look. Dick! Dick! Mr. Kay just phoned.
- Mr. who?
- Mr. Kay.
- The Theatre Guild. They want us.
- Who wants us?
The Theatre Guild.
They want us to do a show.
- The Garrick Gaieties.
- Oh, yeah. I heard about that.
The kids are putting on some kind of a benefit to buy tapestries
- for the Guild's new theater.
- But, Dick, it's the Theatre Guild.
- But it's only another benefit.
- Well, can't we talk it over, anyway, huh?
Watch me change the mogul of baby clothes back into a musician.
Wanna bet? Come on. Come on.
And darned if he didn't.
So there it was in big, bright lights,
The Garrick Gaieties.
On the first of May
It is moving day
Spring is here so blow your job
Throw your job away
Now's the time to trust
To your Wanderlust
In the city's dust you wait
Must you wait?
Just you wait
In a mountain greenery
Where God paints the scenery
Just two crazy people together
While you love your lover
Let blue skies be your coverlet
When it rains, we don't mind the weather
And if you're good
I'll search for wood
$0 you can cook
While I stand looking
Beans could get no keener reception in a beanery
Bless our mountain greenery home
When the world was young
Old Father Adam with sin would grapple
So we're entitled to just one apple
I mean, to make apple sauce
Underneath the bough
We'll learn a lesson from Mister Omar
Beneath the eyes of no Pa and no Ma
Old Lady Nature is boss
And if you're good
I'll search for wood
$0 you can cook
While I stand looking
Beans could get no keener reception in a beanery
Bless our mountain greenery home
Simple cooking means
More than French cuisines
I've a banquet planned which is sandwiches and beans
Coffee's just as grand
With a little sand
Eat and you'll grow fatter, boy
Shatter, boy?
Attaboy
In a mountain greenery
Where God paints the scenery
Just two crazy people together
How we love sequestering
Where no pests are pestering
No dear Mama holds us in tether
Mosquitoes here won't bite you, dear
I'll let them sting me on the finger
We could find no cleaner retreat from life's machinery
Than our mountain greenery home
Down with city slickings
Up with cows and chickens
Down with noise and clutter
Up with milk and butter
Down with life's machinery
Bless our mountain greenery
home!
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hi, Mr. Hart. Here's your morning papers.
- Three of each.
- Yeah. How much do I owe you?
- That'll be 24 cents for the works.
- 24 cents?
24 cents I haven't got, but here's a buck.
Buy yourself a railroad.
- Gee, thanks!
- That's all right, Eddie.
Hey, Morn! Morn!
- The papers are here.
- Coffee is ready, Lorry.
Just a minute, will you, darling?
Just a minute.
Here it is, here it is.
"Last night a group of the younger Theatre Guild actors
"came up with a little hand-built revue called The Garrick Gaieties.
"And to my utter amazement,
I found it jammed throughout
"with talented young people, bright tunes, sparkling lyrics and smart sketches."
- Mom, we're in. We're a hit.
- But naturally, Lorry.
I'll get that.
- Good morning, Richard.
- Hello, darling.
Have you heard the good news?
- We're a hit. We're in.
- But of course.
And if the Theatre Guild has any notions about this little show running for just a few performances, they'd better forget it.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Uh-oh.
-"Uh-oh," what?
-"The music."
- What about the music?
"The music," it says here,
"is fresh and melodic and engaging,
"and these qualities are bound to carry composer Richard Rodgers to the top
"in years to come.
"Meanwhile, by the way, just who is Mr. Richard Rodgers?"
Mr. Richard Rodgers is the young gentleman who is making my coffee get cold.
Now just a minute, Mrs. Hart.
I want to prove to you that Larry isn't so famous, either.
-"The lyrics."
- What about the lyrics?
"The lyrics are bright, witty and adult and in good taste.
"In short, they are excellent.
"And it is a pleasure to greet a new writer as gifted as he is unknown,
"Mr. Lorenz Hart."
- Mr. Hart.
- Mr. Rodgers.
I'll get it.
- Hiya, Morn.
- Hello, Eddie.
Have you seen the notices?
They're terrific. Morn, we're a smash.
- But certainly.
- Hi, Dick. Hi, Larry.
Have you seen what's in the papers here about Herbie Fields?
- No. What does it say?
- Oh, boy, it says right here,
"The original sketches were concocted
"by a young man nobody ever heard of,
Herbert Fields.
"Outstanding in a smart cast was singer Eddie Anders who will be..."
- Eddie Anders? Hey, that's me!
- Congratulations.
- You're in, Eddie!
- I'll get it. I'll get it.
Good morning, Herb.
Oh, you bet it's a good morning.
Have you heard the news?
- Sure. We are smash.
- Yes, that's right. We are.
- Hi, fellows.
- Hi, Herbie.
Have you read these write-ups?
- They're the most sensational...
- Yeah, I read them.
- Well, what's the matter?
- Nothing's the matter.
- Everything's fine.
- What is it? What is it?
James Kelly.
He wants to produce a show.
- What? Kelly?
- Yes, I was up all night with him.
He saw the Gaieties last night and he wants to do a show with us.
- On Broadway?
- Not in Bridgeport!
- That's great.
- What are we waiting for?
Mom, cook some breakfast, will you, please?
Mary. Mary, honey, cook some breakfast, too.
We'll start right away. 3:00 sharp.
We've already got My Funny Valentine and You're Nearer.
- What time is it?
9:30. I've got to make a phone call.
Talk to yourselves, will you?
Hello. Give me Trafalgar 2098, please.
Hello.
Hello. Hello. Is this my blue-eyed friend from Boston?
This is your red-eyed friend from Boston.
- Who is it?
- This is Larry. Larry Hart, yeah.
Now, look, don't get excited.
Don't even wake up.
You're dreaming this, only it's true.
We sold our musical comedy.
Gee, Larry, that's marvelous, really and truly.
You're going to be in it, hear me?
I'll see you at the club tonight.
And I'm gonna bring
Herb and Dick with me.
And aside from that,
I don't know anything new.
Thank you, Larry.
Larry, I'd like to measure you right now.
I'll bet you're really taller. I know I am.
Goodbye.
There you are, sir, and if I do say so myself, they look fine.
- They look all right, huh?
- Oh, yes, sir.
Get up.
Go ahead, walk.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four, turn, two, three, four.
They feel fine, but I feel as if I were walking downhill, you know?
Well, naturally.
- What about the trousers?
- Oh, yes. You see, I forgot to tell you.
When the lifts move you up, the trousers, shall we say, move up proportionately.
- However, with a slight adjustment...
- Slight adjustment?
You're completely defeating your purpose.
Well, they feel very comfortable,
- but I get a little... In the back of it.
- Oh, yes.
For a while, you'll notice a slight tenseness in those back muscles.
However, after a while, that too will adjust itself.
- Look all right?
- Oh, excellent, sir.
Oh, I must warn you.
When you take your shoes off at night, if you notice a slight popping of the ears, don't let it alarm you.
- 3:00 sharp, huh?
- Well, you know Larry.
Here it is 5:15, he's not here yet.
Hiya, baby. Hiya, kid.
Notice anything different? Look, you guys.
- Haircut?
- No.
- Shave?
- No. Well?
- Well, what?
- Well, what? The shoes. Look.
- The shoes?
- Certainly. The shoes.
2" taller. How about that?
- Taller?
- Sure.
- Are you serious?
- Certainly. 2".
No kidding. Built up on the inside.
You can't even see it.
You ought to get some sometime.
Anybody call?
Peggy-
- Yeah?
Say, we've got to go over to the club and see her tonight.
And is she excited about doing the show.
- What show?
- What show?
Why, our new show, of course.
Why? Does she want to be in the chorus?
Chorus? Why, she's going to do the part.
You both like her, don't you?
Oh, sure, but, Larry, this isn't The Garrick Gaieties.
- Did you ever hear of Joyce Harmon?
- Yeah. Certainly.
Well, Mr. Kelly's got her signed to a personal contract.
That's one of the main reasons he's doing our show, because she's right for it.
Why, Joyce Harmon's the greatest thing you've ever seen.
Yeah, I know. But you said that she was...
Look, Larry, we're not producing the show.
A man investing that much money in a couple of new authors, he wants some protection.
You can understand that.
Yeah. I can understand that.
Oh, the wild herd gathers where the moon is full
There's not much buffalo but lots of bull
Way out West
In the wild, wild West
Away out West on West End Avenue
Yippee-ay-yay! You!
Well, tell me all about it.
- Drinks are on me tonight.
- Oh.
25% off.
Well, herds to our show.
- Peggy...
- What's wrong, Larry?
Nothing the matter with the show?
After I talked to you this morning,
I talked to Dick and Herb, and it seems as though the producer has Joyce Harmon under contract and...
- She's going to do the part.
- Yeah.
I'm awfully sorry, Peggy.
It's going to take all the boot out of doing this show, for me, anyway.
Don't worry. It's not so bad.
I got a call this afternoon from the Shubert office.
They want me to go on the road with some operetta.
It's not the greatest part in the world, but the money's pretty good and I guess I could use the experience.
Peggy, this isn't the time, but ever since I saw you...
Larry, please.
We're both a little off-balance now, and we both have many things to do.
I know I have.
Well, I went on record, anyway.
Let's drink some of this before it gets flat.
That was the touch-off spark
that was to affect everything Larry Hart ever did again.
But, frankly, I was more concerned
with our new musical comedy and our new leading lady.
Fortune never smiles, but in my case
It just laughs right in my face
If} looked for a horseshoe, I suppose
It would bop me right in the nose
My luck will vary surely
That's purely a curse
My luck has changed
It's gotten from rotten
to worse
Where's that rainbow you hear about?
Where's that lining they cheer about?
Where's that love nest where love is king ever after?
Where's that blue room they sing about?
Where's that sunshine they fling about?
I know morning will come
But pardon my laughter
In each scenario you can depend on the end
Where the lovers agree
Where's that Lothario?
Where does he roam?
With his dame Vaseline-d as can be
It is easy to see all right
Everything's gonna be all right
Be just dandy for everybody
but me
It is easy to see all right
Everything's gonna be all right
Be just dandy for everybody but me
It is easy to see all right
Everything's gonna be all right
Be just dandy for everybody
and me
- Got that blue room
- To sing about
- Sun is shining
- To fling about
- Got that love nest
- You hear about
- A silver lining
- To cheer about
You can have that rainbow
'Cause we got that rainbow
now
- Who is it?
- It's me.
Oh, come in.
I ran back before the crowd got in.
- Well, how was it?
- You were only sensational.
Thank you, Dick, for everything.
The flowers, your help, the way you conducted.
You're welcome.
Joyce, would you like to go out tonight?
- Have a drink maybe?
- Oh, Dick, I'm sorry.
But you know me, opening night.
I'm going right home, get a hamburger and crawl into bed.
- Give me a rain check, will you?
- Sure.
- How about tomorrow? It's Sunday.
- Oh, that's right.
I tell you what, come over around 4:00 and I'll make you a nice cup of tea.
4:00? I'll be there.
More flowers.
Dick, they're perfectly beautiful.
Thank you again.
There.
- Well, sit down.
- Thanks.
I hate Saturday night openings, don't you?
Yeah.
Waiting till Monday for the notices is kind of like a Chinese execution.
Is something troubling you, Dick?
Look, Joyce,
I can't say this the way I want to, so I'll just say it plain.
I'm in love with you.
And I've been in love with you a long time and I don't know what to do about it.
Do you...
- Are you serious?
- I'd like to marry you.
Well, I guess that's all there is to it.
Dick, come here.
I can't tell you how sweet that was, your telling me just that way.
You're one of the nicest persons
I've ever known.
But nice as it is to hear, it just doesn't make sense.
But why does it have to make sense?
Because being in love is more than just saying it, or wanting to be, or thinking you are.
And your being in love with me is impossible.
- Believe me, it is.
- Why?
Well, mathematics.
I'm 33, you're 23.
What difference does that make?
Dick, when a woman's 33, a day's a difference, a week's a difference, a month's a difference.
Ten years, that's a century.
Well, I guess that's that.
How would you like your tea?
With or without sugar?
Two lumps are fine for me.
Sugar or no,
I was a very bitter young man.
The girl of my dreams didn't love me and all the world was sad and dreary.
In black despair, I decided to do
what every young fellow with a broken heart does.
I decided to go to the movies.
But I was in no mood to be alone and so in search of company,
I dropped in on an old friend,
Ben Feiner.
- Hello, Dorothy. Is Ben home?
- No, but come in.
Thanks.
I'm sorry. Ben went out.
Say, when did you get so big?
Oh, I don't know. Just lately, I guess.
Well, I thought maybe Ben would like to see a movie or something.
- Well, I don't know when he'll be back.
- It doesn't matter.
You've been away at school, haven't you?
- Came in to see your show last night.
- Really?
- Liked it very much.
- Thank you.
- I've seen all your shows.
- Both of them?
Excuse me. Won't you sit down?
I was just making some tea.
Would you like some?
No, thank you. I had my tea today.
- How are the folks?
- Fine. They'll be in soon.
Well, I guess I'll go to the movie myself.
They say it's a good picture.
- Camille. Have you seen it?
- No, I haven't, but I'm going to.
- Well, tell Ben to call me.
- All right.
Oh, say, Dorothy, you wouldn't like to see the movie with me?
- Oh, thank you, but I'm afraid not.
- Why not?
Well, you see, I...
Well, I never go out with older men.
- With what?
- You know what I mean.
- All of Ben's friends are kind of...
- Kind of old men, huh?
Well, I'm sure you understand.
Oh, certainly. I understand perfectly.
Good night.
That was really Black Sunday for me.
Shut out twice.
Once because I was too young, and once because I was too old.
I pictured myself tragically wandering around the globe for the rest of my days.
And in my grief I was certainly in the right frame of mind to see Camille.
But I'd clean forgotten that there was a big stage show,
all built around one of our numbers.
Remember the youth amid snow and ice
Who bore the banner with the strange device
"Excelsior"
This motto applies to those who dwell
In Richmond Hill or New Rochelle
In Chelsea or in Sutton Place
You've got to reach the heights
To win the race
See the pretty apple, top of the tree
The higher up, the sweeter it grows
Picking fruit you've got to be
Up on your toes
See the pretty penthouse, top of the roof
The higher up, the higher rent goes
Get that dough, don't be a goof
Up on your toes
They climb the clouds
To come through with air mail
The dancing crowds
Look up to some rare male
Like that Astaire male
See the pretty ladies, top of the crop
You wanna know the way the wind blows?
Then, my boy, you'd better hop
Up on your toes
Up on your toes
That day I was very much alone.
Larry was away seeing Peggy, and I hoped
things were going a lot better for him than they had for me.
Now you've really got me surrounded.
A bolted door, a Rodgers and Hart song.
What's the next twist to the plot?
Well, that shouldn't be hard to guess.
It's the love scene.
You know, where the fellow tells the girl that she's like a Roman candle, a Greek chorus, an Italian gondola, only here we are in Indianapolis.
Then when he runs out of things to say, instead of coming to the point, he reaches into his pocket and hands her a prop.
Go ahead. Try it on for size.
Excuse me.
What's the matter, Peggy?
Don't you want it?
Sure, I want it. I want it very much.
But I just can't.
Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute, will you, Peg? This is Larry Hart.
Remember me?
The fellow who wants to marry you.
Larry, that's just the trouble.
What?
I love you too much to fool you, but I don't love you enough to marry you.
- A little too much but not quite enough.
- Please don't, Larry.
Look, you're a big success, you're talented, you're funny and nice, and there's so much else in life for you.
None of that seems important to me now.
I only wish you were the guy.
I hate hurting you.
No, it's not your fault. It's mine.
It always hurts when you find out you've been kidding yourself.
And deep down,
I always knew I really wasn't the guy.
I wanted it to be you.
- So much.
- I knew.
For me, your heart doesn't pound, your stars don't sing, and your world doesn't stop.
That's why I'm not the guy.
- Larry, where you going?
- Who knows?
The thing is to go and go fast.
Lexington 5400.
Hello, Dick?
Lorry is home.
- Hiya, Mr. Hart.
- Hiya, Dick.
- Well, what do you say?
- Oh, I'm fine.
Missed you. Where've you been?
Oh, went to a couple of places
I always wanted to see.
- Did you see them real good?
- Yeah.
I saw them great.
- How's the show doing?
- Selling out.
Oh, that's fine. Anything else new?
What's new?
Oh, nothing much.
Been fooling around with a tune or two.
That's good.
What's wrong, Larry?
The usual thing.
The love song is slowing up the show a bit.
- Anything I can do?
- No.
No, everything's been done.
No more love songs. That's all. No.
Just those fast, bright things from here on in, huh? Huh?
Larry, I hate to see you like this.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to get lost.
I didn't mean to get everybody in a storm.
- It's all over.
- It's all over.
Finie la guerre. The boat has sailed.
It's all over. Well...
What do we do next, huh?
- Feel like working?
- Sure. Sure, anything.
Make me an offer.
- We got a wire from Cochran in London.
- Yeah?
- He wants us to bring our show over.
- The Girl Friend?
- That's right.
- Oh. Gosh.
- Cochran, huh?
- Right away.
Oh, good. Is it a good deal?
- What do we think about it?
- I'm ready.
I'm with you. When do we sail?
"This London, this hub of the British empire,
"is a city of traditions and of history.
"It's the city of Shakespeare.
It's the city of Chaucer."
It's a city where you can't get a hot dog or an ice-cream soda.
Look, do you want to listen to this or not?
Of course we do.
Don't pay any attention to him. Go on.
Now. Now about Parliament. It says,
"This impressive monument to free institutions
"covers 8 acres, has 1,100 rooms,
"100 staircases and 2 miles of passages."
I'm glad I don't have to clean it.
"It's the mother of Parliaments dedicated to the right of..."
Holy smoke! That reminds me.
I forgot to write my mother.
Come on, let's go, Eddie.
From all visitors and inquisitors
We'll keep our apartment
I won't change your plans
You arrange your plans
Just the way your heart meant
Here we'll be ourselves
And we'll see ourselves
Doing all the things we're scheming
Here I've planned for us
Something grand for us
Where no one can see us
dreaming
We'll have a blue room
A new room, for two room
Where every day's a holiday
Because you're married to me
Not like a ballroom
A small room
A hall room
Where I can smoke my pipe away
With your wee head upon my knee
We will thrive on
Keep alive on
Just nothing but kisses
With mister and missus
On little blue chairs
You sew your trousseau
And Robinson Crusoe
Is not so far from worldly cares
As our blue room
far away upstairs
They will thrive on
Keep alive on
Just nothing but kisses
With mister and missus
On little blue chairs
She'll wear her trousseau
And Robinson Crusoe
Is not so far
from worldly cares
As our blue room
far away
upstairs
"Rodgers and Hart, Girl Friend.
"London click.
"R. and H. sail for NY to do Connecticut Yankee."
Goodbye, peace and quiet.
After all the dizzy excitement of our first show abroad,
the trip home was a letdown.
And once again Larry became restless.
- Here you are.
- Hi.
I just thought who would be great to play the lead in A Connecticut Yankee.
- Yeah, who?
Peggy-
She's just right for it.
- Do you really think so?
- Sure. Why don't you call her?
Ship to shore. What are you waiting for?
Hello! Hello!
Well, aren't you excited?
Oh. Well, tomorrow morning.
I'll meet you at the dock.
No, you'll have to be there. I won't listen.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Now don't forget. Goodbye.
- Well, hello, Brian.
- Hello.
- Do you see her at all, Dick?
- Not yet.
Hi, Dick! Dick Rodgers!
- Hello, Ben.
- Hi, Larry.
- Hi, Ben.
- Good to see you, boy.
- You just get in?
- Yeah.
Well, so did I. On the Roma, from Naples.
Excuse me, will you, fellows?
I got to find somebody.
- I didn't know you'd been in Europe.
- Yeah, yeah. In fact, the whole family.
- Mr. Feiner.
- Glad to see you.
- Mrs. Feiner.
- So nice to see you.
- Hello, Dick. How are you?
- Hello, Dorothy. I didn't recognize you.
- Mr. Feiner, your baggage is ready, sir.
- Thank you.
- We'll see you in customs, Dorothy.
- All right, fine, Ben.
- See you later, Dick.
- So long, Ben.
Goodbye, Dick.
How would you like to go to a movie with me sometime?
Be glad to ask my mother and father. Goodbye.
Oh, I'm having a birthday party in three weeks at Tarrytown.
Would you like to come?
- How old?
- Eighteen.
Gee, I don't know.
Eighteen-year-old girls are pretty old for me.
But I'll be glad to ask my mother and father.
Well, I'll see you then.
Telegram for Mr. Hart.
Telegram for Mr. Hart.
Right here, fellow.
- Mr. Lorenz Hart?
- Yeah, that's right.
Sign here, please.
Oh, wait a minute. Here.
- There you go.
- Thank you, sir.
Dear Larry. Sorry I couldn't meet you.
Signed a contract for pictures.
Left for the coast this morning.
Good luck with your new show.
Love, Peggy.
Oh, thank you.
- Happy birthday, Sis.
- Ben.
- Would you like to dance?
- I'd like to climb a tree.
- Well, I don't happen to have one on me.
- Oh, but I do. Come on.
So we're going to climb a tree, huh?
Any tree I know?
Oh, you'll see. Follow me, monsieur.
- What is this?
- My private tree.
I spend half my life up here.
In fact, it's where I spin my finest dreams.
- Well.
- This is wonderful.
And now, Mr. Rodgers,
I would like the story of your life.
At this altitude?
You can skip your boyhood and start at the part where you fell in love with the leading lady, Joyce Harmon.
- I see you've been reading my mail.
- Did she really break your heart?
You bet. And I didn't get over it for, oh, an hour and a half.
Oh, that's not what I heard.
What did you hear?
I heard that's why you went to London, to forget her.
I'm going to have plenty of trouble with you.
All right, I was in love with her.
And I did go to London to forget her.
But she's a very remarkable woman, and we both should be very grateful to her because she saved me.
- Saved you?
- She saved me for you.
Gee, I never thought of that.
Remind me to send her some flowers.
We can't rehearse that other number because we...
- Any word from Larry?
- He'll show up. He always does.
What do we do now?
We need extra lyrics for Thou Swell.
I'd better go with them.
Hi, Dick.
Hi.
How's it going?
What's the matter? Is something wrong?
Let's take a walk.
Well, where have you been?
I went out on the coast.
- Oh, great. And?
- And nothing. She'd gone to Mexico.
You mean you just went out there?
I wired her first, but she went to Mexico, anyway.
- Well, I don't know what to tell you, Larry.
- There's nothing to tell.
Oh, yes, there is, there's plenty.
And if I don't, who will?
- Oh, I know.
- Oh, sure, you know.
But here we are in rehearsals, the whole company waiting for the lyrics, everybody going crazy and where are you?
- I know.
- It's murder.
You're murdering yourself, your work, everybody.
You've got to pull yourself together.
You can't keep running around the world chasing rainbows.
- They're ready with that number, Dick.
- Okay, Tommy. I'll be right there.
Dick. Dick!
Are not mine eyes fair to view?
They're there to view thee
Wilt not thine own dare to view
What love canst be?
Ah, see my color pale for thee
Hear my heart fail for thee, too
I have a sweet tale for thee
'Tis sad but true
'Tis sad
but true
Thy words are queer, sir
Unto mine ear, sir
Yet thou art a dear, sir, to me
Thou couldst woo me
Now couldst thou try, knight
I'd murmur swell, too
And like it well, too
More thou wilt tell to
Sandy, thou art dandy
Now art thou my knight
Thine arms are martial
Thou hast grace
My cheek is partial to thy face
And if thy lips grow weary
Mine are their resting place
Thou swell, thou witty
Thou sweet, thou grand
Wouldst kiss me pretty?
Wouldst hold my hand?
Both thine eyes are cute, too
What they do to me
Hear me holler
I choose a sweet lollapalooza in thee
I'd feel so rich in
a hut for two
Two rooms and kitchen
I'm sure would do
Give me just a plot of
Not a lot of land
And thou swell
Thou witty
Thou grand
Thou swell
Thou witty
Thou sweet
Thou pretty
Thou terrific
Thou sensational
Thou grand
With a song in my heart
I behold your adorable face
Just a song at the start
But it soon was a hymn to your grace
But I always knew
I would live life through
With a song in my heart
for you
- Do you like it?
- It's lovely. Play it again, please.
You know, that's the kind of a song that could solve everyone's romantic problems.
Now imagine two people in love, and the fellow is, you know, one of those bashful types.
All he has to do is take her to hear this song.
Wouldn't have to propose, ask her father, nothing.
I think I know what you mean.
A song like this, she might even end up marrying him.
Couldn't she?
But she'd have to know him a little bit better first.
Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Lena Horne.
It seems we've stood and talked
like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember
where or when
The clothes you're wearing
are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember
where or when
Some things that happened
for the first time
Seem to be happening again
And so it seems
That we have met before
And laughed before
And loved before
But who knows where
or when
Quite a coincidence that she happens to be singing a Rodgers and Hart song.
If you think that's a coincidence, wait until you hear the next number.
I've wined and dined on Mulligan stew
And never asked for turkey
As I hitched and hiked and grifted, too
From Maine to Albuquerque
Alas, I missed the Beaux Arts Ball
And what is twice as sad
I was never at a party
Where they honored Noel Ca'ad
But social circles spin too fast for me
My hobohemia is the place to be
I get too hungry for dinner at eight
I like the theater, but never come late
I never bother with people I hate
That's why the lady is a tramp
I don't like crap games with barons and earls
Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls
Don't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls
That's why the lady is a tramp
I like the free, fresh wind in my hair
Life without care
I'm broke, that's oke
Hate California
It's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp
I go to Coney, the beach is divine
I go to ballgames, the bleachers are fine
I get the columns and read every line
That's why the lady is a tramp
I like a prizefight when it's not a fake
I like the rowing on Central Park Lake
I go to opera and stay wide awake
That's why the lady is a tramp
I like the green grass under my shoes
What can I lose?
I'm flat, that's that
I'm all alone when I lower my lamp
That's why the lady
is a tramp
Now's a good time.
- For what?
- To ask a girl to marry someone.
Are you sure we're well enough acquainted?
Well, it's hard to answer a question like that unless you've just been kissed.
We're well enough acquainted.
Dick, how do you think
Larry's going to feel about us?
It's not going to be easy for him.
Here we are happy, in love, going to be married, a whole bright future ahead of us.
And what's he got?
- Shall I try to talk to him?
- What would you say?
Well, I don't know,
I'm so lucky these days,
I might think of something.
I'm awful glad you talked me into marrying you.
So am I.
- Well, now, what's the big secret?
- Dick and I are going to be married.
Married? That's wonderful!
- She's going to be married.
- Congratulations. Very nice.
Yes, married. That is wonderful.
Dick and I have been together for so long, the thought of him getting married, it's a little strange.
But you're going to be very happy because he's a wonderful guy.
- So are you.
- Me?
I'm just a guy that writes lyrics, runs away, hides, has a few laughs,
- comes back and writes lyrics.
- Yes, I know.
- And in between, you fall in love.
- We don't talk about that.
Oh, yes, we do.
Our being happy won't mean as much if you're miserable.
Miserable? Me? Why, I'm always happy.
- No one's always happy.
- All right, so I'm slightly miserable.
You're a woman, so maybe you can tell me.
Why couldn't she have loved me just a little bit when I...
When I loved her so much?
Maybe she loves you more than you think.
No, no, it's not that.
There's something about me.
When we'd get right up to the wire, it would stop her.
What is it? Am I that ugly?
Am I that repulsive?
Oh, don't say that about yourself.
How corny can I get?
Dick thinks that you and he ought to go to the coast to do some pictures, and he feels you don't want to.
Would you like to give me a real nice wedding present?
Sure, anything, darling. What?
Well, after we're married, we want you to come to California with us
- on our honeymoon.
- On your honeymoon?
You've talked me into it.
Hollywood, here I come.
- So this is Hollywood.
- No. Beverly Hills.
Beverly Hills Hotel on your left.
Chinese Theatre.
Well, there's nothing like a house with a view.
When do we start taking oxygen?
As I understand it, you'll be here quite a while, Mr. Hart.
Just you and your mother.
And an occasional friend or two.
Well, you'll need a nice, comfortable spot, plenty of privacy, but not too ostentatious.
This is it.
- Nice cozy little place.
- Yeah.
The place leases with or without the staff.
Let's see, butler, houseman, cook, pastry cook, downstairs maid, upstairs maid.
- Where's the bell?
- Oh, right here, right here.
Gardener, chauffeur, footman, watchman.
I'm from the Hollywood Realty Company.
- Oh, yes, of course. Come in, please.
- Thank you.
Thank you, sir, very much.
Hello!
One thing, a fellow would never be lonesome in this place.
- The study is there.
- That's the study.
The music room is there and the dining room is there.
The projection room is there.
Miniature theater is there.
And the billiard room is there.
Who built this place,
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer?
This is the living room.
Yes, it's very livable.
Come and take a look outside.
The patio.
The pool.
Oh, yes, the pool.
And look at that view.
Pretty complete, I'd say.
Yeah, but what good is it?
There's no airport.
No, but there's room for one.
Well, Mr. Hart, what do you think?
What do I think?
I think it's sensational. I'll take it.
- Well, that's fine.
- Yeah.
Any resemblance between me and a fellow in his right mind is purely coincidental.
"Mr. and Mrs. Dick Rodgers,
Santa Fe Chief, en route Los Angeles.
"Dear Dick. Come directly to my party.
"Have rented the cutest little cabin you ever saw.
"Just tell driver top of Summit Road in Hollywood Hills.
"Black tie and a girl preferred.
Love and kisses, Larry."
Well, that's what it says, top of Summit Road.
There's dancing in the patio, sir.
Nothing like sneaking into town.
Hey, Dick, Dick, boy!
- Hiya, Larry.
- How are you?
- Larry.
- Dorothy, honey.
Hey, wait just a minute, pal. There you go.
Hey, what do you think of all this, huh?
- Very intimate.
- Come on. Let's go.
- What's the party for?
- What do you mean what's it for?
Does there have to be a reason?
It's a party.
Everybody in Hollywood is here.
This looks like everybody west of the Rockies is here.
Well, you certainly proved that a New Yorker can outdo Hollywood.
Come on. Mom's over here.
Or will you have a drink first?
- No, thanks.
- How about it, Dorothy?
How about an hors d' oeuvre?
Here they are.
Keep them going around, will you, fellow?
Here we go.
Morn. Morn, look who's here.
- Hello, Mrs. Hart.
- Dick and Dorothy.
Oh, it is good to see you.
- Oh, you look so nice.
- Why, thank you.
Hey, there's Judy Garland. Hiya, Judy.
Hi, Larry.
Judy, you know my morn, of course.
And Dick and Dorothy Rodgers.
- Hello, Judy.
- Sure, hello.
- It's a wonderful party.
- I'm glad. But excuse me.
I must keep the customers happy.
- Are you coming, Larry?
- Coming, Mother.
Oh, that's all I need. Fine.
Take care. I'll be right back.
- Always in action.
- Yeah.
Say, when are we going to do that show together, Judy?
Oh, we've been talking about that show for so long, it's gotten to be a running gag.
That's only because you're never in New York long enough to sing a chorus.
I know. But look, we're all in Hollywood now.
Is there any chance of our doing a picture together?
- Oh, Judy, I'd love to.
- Now, I know you've got a story
'cause Larry told me so.
And I bet you've got some spare songs, too.
- But, look, sweetie, you see, we...
- What?
Oh, Dorothy, I'm so sorry.
Here you two have just started on your honeymoon
- and I'm trying to shanghai the groom.
- I don't mind.
I knew what I was getting into when I married a composer.
- I might just as well be getting used to it.
- That's marvelous.
- What's marvelous?
- We're going to do a picture together.
- No kidding.
- You heard the lady.
Why, that's fine, but you've got to audition for us if you're going to work for us.
- Okay.
- I'll give you my personal assistance, too.
Come on.
Mel, take I Wish I Were in Love Again, will you?
You don't know that I felt good
When we up and parted
You don't know I knocked on wood
Gladly brokenhearted
Worrying is through, I sleep all night
Appetite and health restored
You don't know how much we're bored
Sleepless nights, the daily fights
The quick toboggan when you reach the heights
I miss the kisses and I miss the bites
I wish I were in love again
The broken dates, the endless waits
The lovely loving and the hateful hates
The conversation with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again
No more pain
No more strain
Now I'm sane, but I would rather be gaga
The pulled-out fur of cat and cur
The fine mis-mating of a him and her
We've learned our lesson
and we wish we were in love again
The furtive sigh, the blackened eye
The words, "I'll love you till the day I die"
The self-deception that believes the lie
I wish I were in love again
When love congeals, it soon reveals
The faint aroma of performing seals
The double-crossing of a pair of eels
I wish I were in love again
No more care
No despair
I'm all there now but I'd rather be punch-drunk
Believe me, sir, I'd much prefer
The classic battle of a him and her
We don't like quiet
and we wish we were in love
again
More, more.
Let's try Johnny One Nate in E flat, huh?
Mel, will you ask some of the boys to come down here?
It'll be a little more friendly.
Johnny could only sing one note
And the note he sang was this
Poor Johnny One Note
Sang out with gusto
And just overlorded the place
Poor Johnny One Note yelled willy-nilly
Until he was blue in the face
For holding one note was his ace
Couldn't hear the brass
Couldn't hear the drum
He was in a class by himself, by gum
Poor Johnny One Note got in Aida
Indeed a great chance to be brave
He took his one note
Howled like the north wind
Brought forth wind that made critics rave
While Verdi turned round in his grave
Couldn't hear the flute
Or the big trombone
Everyone was mute
Johnny stood alone
Cats and dogs stopped yapping
Lions in the zoo all were jealous of Johnny's big trill
Thunderclaps stopped clapping
Traffic ceased its roar
And they tell us Niagara stood still
He stopped the train whistles
Boat whistles, steam whistles cop whistles
All whistles bowed to his skill
Sing, Johnny One Note
Sing out with gusto
And just overlord all the crowd
So sing, Johnny One Note, out loud
Sing, Johnny One Note
Sing, Johnny One Note
out loud
- This is a swell party, huh?
- It certainly is.
- Good night, Larry.
- Good night.
Hey, wait a minute.
Where you going, Eddie?
- Oh, it's late.
- It's after 4:00.
What's 4:00? It's early yet.
Come on, stick around.
- Good night.
- We're gonna have some fun.
- Good night.
- Thanks. Good night.
- Well, we have to go, too, Larry.
- Wait a minute, Dick.
- You two are going to stay here.
- We can't, Larry.
We're staying at the Beverly Hills Hotel.
But we'll see you tomorrow.
Well, let's have one for the road, huh, Dick?
- No, thanks, Larry.
- How about it, Dorothy?
No, thank you.
It sure has been a swell party, hasn't it?
- Yeah, it sure has.
- Mighty fine.
- Good night, Larry.
- Good night, Dorothy.
- Good night, Larry.
- Good night. Good night, Dick.
- Good night, Dick.
- Good night, Larry.
All right, that's it for tonight, boys.
Hey! Hey, Mel! Wait a minute. Hey.
Hey, Mel, what's going on here?
Well, we kind of figured with everybody leaving...
Oh, we don't need people.
Hey, hey, wait a minute, fellows.
Keep going, will you?
Waiter, give the fellows champagne, lots of champagne, will you?
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
- That's what we want. Sure.
Anything special you'd like to hear,
Mr. Hart?
Yeah, play...
No, no, better not play that.
Play anything, anything at all, fellows.
Just so it's Rodgers and Hart.
Number 16, boys. Sixteen. Here we go.
Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms could ever hold
I heard somebody whisper
“Please adore me“
And when I looked
The moon had turned to gold
Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
In spite of everything, we made quite a few pictures in Hollywood
and the years slipped pleasantly by.
But when we were asked to do a Broadway show,
we decided that change would be good, and so we started East.
When Dorothy and I left New York, we were a family of two, two adults.
But when we returned, we were a family of four, two adults and two children.
Board!
I beg your pardon.
We were a family of five, two adults and three children.
Well?
They're great, Larry, five of the best lyrics you've ever done.
Thanks, baby.
But don't forget we start rehearsing Monday, and you still haven't written anything for the love song.
Don't worry, you'll get it. Come in.
Chicago in 20 minutes, gentlemen.
All right.
We're going to go over to the hotel and freshen up. Corning along?
Thanks very much, but there are a couple of places I'd like to see and...
Okay-
But don't forget, the Century leaves at 4:00 and it doesn't wait.
Don't worry. I'll be there.
- You sure?
- You can count on me.
You can't count on him, Dick!
For weeks he's been promising us the lyrics for the love song.
And if we don't get them, we have no love song.
- And if we have no love song...
- We have no show. Yes, yes, I know.
Oh, how can he act this way?
I'm worried, Eddie.
This time I'm really worried.
I'd go after him myself, but I have to stay with the show.
Of course, you do.
Even if I caught up with him,
I don't know how much good it would do.
He's taken an awful lot of sermons from me.
But we gotta get him back.
Look, Dick, you know how much
I love the little guy.
Why don't you let me take a crack at it?
- Will you?
- You know I will.
But Larry couldn't be located anywhere.
Confused and dispirited, among strange people and strange places,
he was just a lost guy and no one could help him.
He had to find his way back alone.
Warm for spring, isn't it?
Nice breeze, though.
It's a lovely night with the stars and all.
So I hear.
Wait a minute.
Spring is here.
Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear.
Why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me.
Spring is here,
I hear.
- Taxi!
- Taxi.
Yeah.
Yeah, taxi. Of course, taxi!
Sea, you later, baby. Take care. Here.
If you don't like it, trade it in on a lawn mower.
- Hey, where are you going?
- I gotta see somebody.
Airport, driver.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Hey!
How about coming down here and helping a fellow, huh?
- Uncle Larry!
- Larry!
- Larry.
- Larry.
- Hello, Linda.
- Uncle Larry!
- Linda, darling.
- Hiya, Larry.
Why, it's so good to see you.
- Hello, Dorothy.
- What are those? Presents?
- Oh, Linda, now, really.
- Oh, boy!
Here this is for you and the purple and blue one is for you.
- Oh, boy.
- All right, sweetheart.
- Oh, Larry.
- Don't I get a kiss?
All right. This is for you, too, Dorothy.
Thank you, Linda.
And this is, of course, for you, Dick.
Well, thank you, Mr. Hart.
- Mr. Rodgers.
- Larry, you look tired.
Tired? Me? Don't be silly.
Well, I am.
Let's go over and sit on the terrace.
- Us, too?
- No, Mary, not us two, us three.
You two take your presents, say thank you, and go play.
- Thank you, Uncle Larry.
- Thank you, Uncle Larry.
- All right, darlings.
- Go on.
- Oh, Larry.
- It's good to see you, Larry.
Good to see you, too, darling.
This is very nice.
I like this.
I even like the grass and the trees.
Well, why don't you try it for a while?
Yes, Larry, why don't you?
Why don't you stay?
I'd like to very much.
I'd like to.
Well, Mr. Hart, tell us where you've been.
To a couple more places.
Would you like something to eat or something to drink?
No. No, thank you. I'd just like to sit here and look at you and the children and this place.
The air here is so wonderful.
Coffee, darling?
Thanks.
- Remember Peggy?
- Peggy?
Yeah.
I hear she hasn't been doing so well.
Do you think I ought to try and help her?
If it would help you.
Probably won't.
Nothing seems to add up.
I'm not kidding myself.
Peggy isn't real anymore.
She's a symbol, a symbol of failure.
- A long line of failures.
- What failures?
- Stop talking that way, Larry.
- It's the truth.
I've done all right with my work, yes.
But I've failed in everything else.
Everything. Don't ask me why.
I don't know why.
I'm on a constant merry-go-round.
And that's no good, baby.
Let's face it, maybe Mr. Hart's lyrics are a hit, but Mr. Hart's life is a flop.
Don't you know you're one of the sweetest, most generous, talented men in the world?
Look, Larry, why don't you stay here with us? Close.
And start working again.
Dick has a play lined up for Gene Kelly.
- He needs you.
- Yeah, I know, baby, but I...
You're confused, darling.
And it takes time.
But, Larry, you can't let yourself go like this.
You must go on with your work.
It's too important.
Stay here and go back to work?
Okay, baby. I'll try.
I'll start trying right now.
And thanks.
Congratulations, Larry.
The show is terrific.
- Larry! Oh, Larry!
- Darling!
- You were wonderful.
- Thanks a million.
- Just great.
- Oh, thanks.
- Where's Dick?
- He's right over there.
Tremendous.
Superb performance, Mr. Hart.
I am proud of you.
Oh, Vera. Vera, I can't tell you how wonderful you were.
Thank you. Thanks very much.
Another hit.
The music, every single thing...
- Larry!
- Larry!
Somebody call a doctor!
Call a doctor, somebody!
Call a doctor!
Somebody call a doctor!
Months later, Larry was still very ill.
During those months we had completed a revival of a Connecticut Yankee.
To do it, Larry had to call on his last reserves.
And by opening night, his condition was desperate.
Dick, can I go with you?
You've heard most of the songs before.
And my singing won't make you feel any better.
I'll come back after each number and tell you everything.
- Here, Larry.
- What is it?
Take it, and when you wake up you'll have a big hit.
Mr. Hart.
Mr. Rodgers.
Theater.
I gotta get to the theater.
The theater.
Taxi, mister? Hey, mister! Taxi?
- Martin Beck Theater, please.
- Okay.
- What happened? Get a doctor.
- Stand back. Stand back.
Hurry, hurry, get a doctor. Get a doctor.
Some time later, before a packed audience,
the greatest figures in show business joined in paying tribute
to the memory of the little guy who thought that he was all alone.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am one of hundreds of people in the theater, in pictures and on the radio, who has had the happy experience of being in a Rodgers and Hart show.
And it was a happy experience because as show people, we respected and admired them for what they were doing.
Larry's lyrics were gay and clever and witty, but in them all was the note of sadness.
They were and are and will be a source of beauty and pleasure to millions of people.
Among the best loved of Larry's lyrics are these that Perry Como sings for us tonight,
With a Song in My Heart.
With a song in my heart
I behold your adorable face
With a song at the start
But it soon is a hymn to your grace
When the music swells
I'm touching your hand
We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island, too
It's lovely going through the zoo
Where's that rainbow you hear about?
Where's that lining they cheer about?
Thou swell, thou witty
Thou sweet, thou grand
Wouldst kiss me pretty?
Wouldst hold my hand?
I like the free, fresh wind in my hair
Life without care
I'm broke, that's oke
The pulled-out fur of cat and cur
The fine mis-mating of a him and her
We've learned our lesson
and we wish we were in love again
But I always knew
I always knew
I would live life through
I would live life through
With a song in my heart
for you
With a song in my heart
for you
With a song in my heart
Hey, Carlos. Did you learn this song
I wrote for Miss Brooks?
She'll be here in a couple minutes.
When you sing, put your heart and soul into it.
Don't let her get away from you.
Don't worry.
When I sing, they never get away.
Good.
On second thought, you better put my heart and soul into it, huh?
Okay.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...the famous Colombian baritone,
Señor Carlos Ramirez.
Hey, Carlos, there she is.
Let go, Carlos, please.
Please, Carlos, don't...
Sorry.
Hello, how are you?
I'm sorry.
Hello, how are you?
Gee, it's fun to be people.
- Darling.
- Yes, dear?
I wrote a letter to Dean Clinton last night.
I told her to get a new swimming teacher.
Sweetheart.
I just put a call through to George Adams and told him to find a new songwriter.
- Darling.
- Yes, dear?
- I've a surprise for you.
- What?
I can cook.
Sweetheart, I have a surprise for you.
I can't eat.
Have these things taken up to my room, will you?
- Name, please?
- Adams. George Adams.
- Very well, sir.
- Hello, George, what are you doing here?
Hello, Cugie, I'm here to find out what goes on with that crazy songwriter.
You mean Elliott?
I mean Elliott.
He came to write music for my water pageant.
And what do I get?
Nothing. I send at least 20 wires asking what's wrong.
What does he answer?
Nothing. Cugie, I can't stand it.
What's happened to him? Where is he?
He's at the pool, of course.
Where else?
The pool? What are you talking about?
He hates water.
But wait till you see what's in it.
Oh, no. Don't tell me it's a woman.
I can't believe it.
- Steve would never fall for a bathing suit.
- But wait till you see what's in it.
You know, he plans to marry that girl.
Settle down here and retire.
Retire?
- No, no, no...
- Oh, yes, yes, yes...
But what am I gonna do with Harry James?
What will I do with my water pageant, these pipes, pumps and faucets?
I don't know.
Have you seen a plumber?
I beg your pardon.
I don't think I know you.
You don't, huh? Listen.
Don't try to give me the brushoff.
- I knew you when.
- When he what?
Yes, of course. How stupid of me.
It's little Mary Donovan.
Maria Dorango to you, you big phony.
"I'm gonna make a star of you, my dear girl.
I'm going to put your name up in lights."
You put my name in your address book and that's as far as it ever went.
But I never forgot you.
I was just waiting for the right role.
Darling, are you sure you're going to be happy living here?
I was never so sure of anything in all my life.
From now on, no more Tin Pan Alley, no more smoky nightclubs...
...no more Broadway producers like George Adams.
I'll never write another boogie-woogie tune as long as I live.
With you as my inspiration, I can write important music like symphonies...
...and tone poems or sonatas.
- We're still gonna be married tomorrow.
- Yes, of course.
Providing my grandfather wires his consent and my dowry.
Your dowry?
- You mean, I'm gonna get money too?
- Oh, come on.
He can't do this to me.
I'm his best friend.
I'll get those songs if I have to stop that marriage.
Maria, I've got it.
How good an actress are you?
- Well, l...
- Fine.
You're about to play the biggest part of your career. Come on.
If there is anyone here who can show why they shouldn't be joined in holy wedlock...
...let him speak now or forever hold his peace.
Do you, Caroline, take this man to be your lawful wedded husband?
I do.
Do you, Steven, take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife?
I do.
I now pronounce you man and wife.
Stop.
What's the meaning of this?
This man is my husband.
- What?
- What?
- What?
- What proof have you?
What proof have I?
Oh, now... No, no, believe me.
Caroline.
Would you care for some lunch,
Miss Brooks?
You've got to connect me.
She's my husband. I mean, I'm her wife.
She checked out. Well, did she leave a forwarding address?
Oh, she didn't, huh?
Okay.
George, she's gone and I've lost her.
- Steady, Steve. Caroline isn't the only girl.
- Well, she is for me.
We'll leave for New York immediately.
In times of stress, work is the solution.
Now, you finish packing.
I'll pay the bill.
Buck up. You must bury yourself in your music.
Yeah, I'd just as soon bury myself.
Hello?
Cugie.
That crazy Dorango woman been around?
She disappeared?
Why does she do this to me?
- Steve, I saw her.
- Which one?
- The good one, Caroline.
- Where?
She was at the travel window buying a ticket.
Well, ticket for what?
You know where she was going?
I don't remember.
Something like, a cow.
Cow? Don't tell me she went to Moscow?
No.
Istanbul?
No.
- Is there some such place as Jersey?
- Well, there's New Jersey.
That's where Victoria College is.
She's gone back to her old job. Come on.
- Hey, is this Victoria College?
- It isn't West Point.
Well, we finally made it. Fling open the gates, my good man, I'm in a hurry.
Just hold your horses. The gates don't fling until I find out what you want.
Oh, I wanna see
Miss Caroline Brooks.
Take off your hat.
- l...
- You aren't gonna see her.
We don't allow men in this school...
...and especially, we don't allow men with red hair.
Well, I didn't know...
Oh, you don't allow men, huh?
What's that guy, a tomboy?
That's Professor Evans.
Professors don't count.
That guy can't read, either.
Nobody gets through these but parents, teachers, students.
- Well, now, l...
- But you are a parent.
What about Tom, Dick and Harry?
You're wasting your time, mister.
Tell her to call me at the Town and Country Club.
It's a matter of life and death.
Mine.
- Very pretty, but that one's flat.
- Oh, how are you, Harry?
Where have you been?
We've been looking for you.
I've been trying to get into college.
- Where's George?
- Out with a posse looking for you.
- He needs that music, Steve, so do I.
- Don't worry. You'll get it.
- Yeah?
- I'll start first thing in the morning.
Swell, now, don't go away.
I'll be back right after this number.
If you don't mind, sir?
Well, thanks a lot.
What are you, a musician?
No, attorney.
- Do you wanna know something?
- No, I don't.
I was gonna be married next month.
I was married last month.
It's that darn charter.
If I don't change it, I'll lose my job.
And if I lose my job, I'll lose my girl.
And if I lose my girl, I'm lost.
- Yeah, I've already lost mine.
- Your job?
No, my girl.
- She's in Victoria College.
- So is the charter.
- What charter?
- The charter I have to change.
The... Look...
Here's my girl. The girl...
- Now, here's my girl.
- I'm very happy to meet you.
And here's the charter.
And here's me.
Now, I have to change that before I can get that.
Is that clear?
Oh, sure.
You're biting my girl.
Now, what's your trouble?
Well, sir, speaking in your language...
...that is me.
I need a haircut, don't I?
That is Victoria College.
And this is the gate man.
And this...
...is Caroline, the apple of me eye.
Now, I have to get past this to get into that...
...to get this.
What are you doing?
I'm putting the charter back in the college.
What charter?
The charter that I've been trying to change.
- Look, Victoria is a woman's college.
- Yeah, and they don't allow men.
No, but it says in the charter they do allow men.
That's why they want me to change it.
What kind of a man would wanna go to a woman's college?
None.
A man should go to a man's college.
And a woman should go to a woman's college.
And a child should go to a child's college.
That's right.
Charter?
Thank you, Professor Evans.
Your paper, "O'er Hill and Dale with Field
Glass and Camera" was most instructive.
- Splendid.
- Yes.
- Wonderful idea.
- Yes, it is splendid.
I'm terribly sorry to interrupt, Dean
Clinton, but there's a man in my office.
- Well?
- Well, he wants to register.
- Well, whom does he want to register?
- Himself.
It's probably some silly college boy sent here on an initiation stunt.
Oh, he isn't a boy. He's a man, with red hair, and he's very determined.
Why should a man wish to become a student here?
He says he has a thirst for knowledge.
And he wants to quench it in our swimming pool.
Caroline, will you take care of this matter while we continue with the meeting?
But Dean Clinton, wouldn't you rather...
I mean, wouldn't you...
No, dear, no. You take charge of it.
Just act the way you say I act, when I'm not around to hear you say it.
Miss Caroline, I can't figure out how he ever got past me.
He must've climbed over the wall.
Shall I throw him out?
No, no, you wait out in the hall.
I'll call you if he gets violent.
Yes.
- Caroline.
- I'm Miss Brooks.
I understand you wish to enroll in Victoria College, Mr...
Elliott. Steven Elliott.
The husband of the same name.
You're not gonna be anybody's husband pretty soon, you Casanova, you.
- I've started annulment proceedings.
- Oh, no, Caroline.
You can't. I'm innocent, believe me.
I was standing there getting married, and...
- Oh, Caroline, you've gotta trust me.
- Trust you?
How can I trust you?
You redheaded bluebeard, you.
Oh, I'm not a blueheaded redbeard...
I mean, a...
Evidently you're not aware of it, but this is a girls' school.
Evidently you're not aware of it,
Miss Brooks...
...but this is a girls' school for boys.
It says so in the charter.
Page 10, Section Six.
Of course, if you were to drop the annulment proceedings...
...I might be persuaded not to enter.
You wait right here, you blackmailer, you.
He claims this is a coeducational institution.
That men and women are permitted.
He says it's in the charter.
Of course he's wrong?
- Unfortunately, he's right.
- What?
I was under the impression our charter had been altered.
Lawyers have been working on the matter.
At the moment, a man is legally entitled to enroll here.
- Why... I've never heard.
- There's just one thing to do.
Have the fellow investigated.
- Oh, I don't think we ought to do that.
- Why not?
Well, think of the publicity.
Caroline is right. Victoria is noted for its cloistered atmosphere.
Our students come from the finest families.
Publicity of this sort would be embarrassing.
Yes, that's right.
He must be gotten rid of quickly and quietly.
- Yes, but how?
- Oh, that's very simple.
Each new student is on two weeks' probation.
If during that period she or he acquires a sufficient number of demerits...
...out she or he goes.
- Good.
- Yes.
Yes, now, if we all cooperate, he should be out of here in no time.
Good.
Well, Steve, you get your wish.
- You mean you'll cancel the annulment?
- No, I mean we accept your application.
All right. Bring on the enrollment blank, pencil sharpener and my roommate.
Oh, may I carry that for you?
Hey, what am I?
A coal miner or a student?
Oh, now, this is charming.
What is it, the Victoria swap shop?
Unfortunately, all our best rooms are occupied.
I hope you'll be very uncomfortable here.
Now, here's your sche...
Here's your schedule of classes.
You'll find them quite heavy.
Gosh, what a romantic spot for a honeymoon.
Here is your book of rules and regulations.
You know, you have the longest eyelashes.
You're expected to follow those implicitly.
Your hair's kind of silky.
Did you ever try braiding it?
We especially stress neatness, truthfulness and punctuality.
You know,
I dream about you every night.
Now we come to the subject of discipline.
Each student is allowed 100 demerits per semester.
You're lovelier than I remembered.
And we give them very freely, especially to you.
One hundred and out you go.
Well, I can hardly wait.
Oh, really?
And 20 demerits for insubordination.
How many demerits for kissing a teacher?
Enough to expel you, you wolf.
Caroline, Caroline, are you all right?
Open the door.
How dare you lock that door.
Well, why not?
You're my wife, aren't you?
Open this door or I shall be forced to break it down.
Call him off. Call him off.
Call him off. Call him off.
- Did this oaf attempt to molest you?
- What do you mean, oaf? I happen...
Steven Elliott, the new student here.
Oh, it seems I was a trifle hasty.
Please accept my apology, old man.
You see, I'm inclined to be a trifle touchy where Miss Brooks is concerned.
Oh, yeah?
Who do you happen to be, bub?
Why, this is Professor Evans, your botany professor, Mr. Elliott.
He knows all there is to know about Tropaeolium.
"Nasturtiums" to you.
Yeah? Nasturtiums to you too.
Caroline, we must allow Mr. Elliott to clean his room, mustn't we?
Yes, we certainly must.
He ought to be ashamed of himself.
Oh, and by the way, I almost forgot.
Here is your freshman beanie.
You will be required to wear it at all times.
And...
...you may find this useful. Good day.
Thank you.
Come on, now.
Hurry.
Hey, come on.
Oh, will you do it, Miss Smith?
- Come on, please?
- Please, come on. Come on.
Ladies, please.
What are you talking about?
Come on, Smitty, nobody can do it like you can.
Come on, please. Please, Smitty.
Now, girls, you know the rules.
- Come on, kids.
- Let's get rid of this stuff.
- Open the top. Let's get started.
- All right.
But if the faculty finds out,
I'll have to leave Victoria.
Lucky you.
That was super, Miss Smith.
- Now let's really get hot.
- Yeah.
Let's go below the border for some South American jive.
- Yeah.
- Wonderful.
Okay, kiddies.
I mean, very well, ladies.
But everyone will have to help.
Okay, Smitty, we're with you.
Oh, wonderful.
Girls, big news. Steve Elliott's here.
Steve Elliott?
You're kidding. The man who wrote
"Boogie Woogie Sugie"?
And "Beat Me Daddy,
With a Boogie Brush"?
And "Dig Me Sister,
With a Solid Spade"?
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's go.
"I have lost my pen in the garden of my aunt?"
Hello.
"I have lost my pen in the garden of my aunt in the Casbah."
I thought you would like to know.
What makes you think
I'd be interested?
Well, you should be.
She's your aunt too.
Oh, look, Caroline, why don't you let me come over and talk to you?
I'm sorry, Mr. Elliott, you'll have to wait until the last Sunday in October.
If you're still here.
That's when I hold my annual reception for new students. Good night.
Well, look, l...
Hello?
Hello?
Relax, Stevey, this isn't French, it's music.
Professor Hendricks won't be here for 10 minutes. We set his clock back.
Oh, good.
His music sets me back about 10 years.
I must have taken a little catnap.
Catnap, my eye. You weren't purring, you were snoring.
Don't men look silly when they're waking up?
Don't men look silly?
I can imagine what you look like when you wake up.
What do you mean?
Do you realize what girls go through to make themselves beautiful?
How they look when they first get up?
Look, I'll show you.
Now, the chair will be the bed. See?
Here's an imaginary dresser with the mirror and the makeup.
The mirror and the makeup are important.
I'll take the part of the girl, see?
Now, you give me something to wake me up like they do early in the morning.
Cheese it, here comes Piccolo Pete.
And now we come to the folk song, or traditional type of melody.
A perfect example of this school is the old Scotch ballad, "Loch Lomond."
You may illustrate, Miss Smith.
And no embellishments, please.
By yon bonnie banks
And by yon bonnie braes
Where the sun shines bright
On Loch Lomond
Oh, we too have passed
So many blithesome days
On the bonnie, bonnie banks
Of Loch Lomond
Oh, you take the high road
And I'll take the low road
And I'll be in Scotland afore ye
But I and my true love
Will never meet again
Are we keeping you awake,
Mr. Elliott?
Barely.
I suppose you think you could improve upon the melody, Mr. Elliott?
Oh, he has, many times.
Oh, indeed.
I shall give him another opportunity.
Thank you, sir.
You'll bring a sample of your improvement tomorrow.
At which time,
I shall turn the class over to you.
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.
That's rather quick notice, isn't it, professor?
Tomorrow, huh?
May I bring my own accompanist?
Oh, you may bring anyone you like.
And now, if you haven't any objections...
...we will proceed with our music,
Mr. Elliott.
Here's coffee. I brought you some doughnuts too. I made them myself.
- I helped her carry them over.
- Oh, swell. Thanks a lot.
- Oh, here they come.
- Here they come.
I'll take the high road
And I'll take the low road
You're not a Tetrazzini
And, babe, you're no Caruso
But don't you get a tingle
Whenever our voices mingle?
You've heard that Sinatra fellow
I swoon when he gets mellow
Well, anything he can do I can do
Accompanied slightly by you
I'll take the high note
And you take the low note
And we'll make sweet music together
I'll sing in your key
And you'll sing in my key
We won't be off-key together
We'd be such a lovely duet
We might even sing at the Met
There's no telling how far we'll go
- lf I sing high
- And I sing low
So I'll take the high note
And you'll take the low note
And we'll make sweet music together
Oh, I'll take the high note
And you take the low note
And I'll be in Dixie afore ye
Well, anything you can do
I can do too
Accompanied slightly by you
I'll take the high note
And you take the low note
And we'll make sweet music together
I'll sing in your key
And you sing in my key
We won't be off-key together
We'd be such a lovely duet
We might even sing at the Met
There's no telling how far we'll go
If you sing high
And you sing low
I'll take the high note
And you take the low note
- High
- High
- Da-da-da-de-a
- Da-da-da-de-a
- Da-do-dey
- Da-do-dey
High, high, high, la-do-da-de-a
I'll take the high note
And you take the low note
And we'll make
- We'll make sweet music together
- We'll make sweet music together
We'd be such a lovely quartet
We might even sing Rigolet
There's no telling what we could do
If I sing true
And I sing blue
High, low
High, high, high, high, the high note
I'll take the high note
And you'll take the low note
And we'll make sweet music together
We four together
We'll take the high note
We'll take the low note
And we'll make sweet music together
We'll sing in your key
We'll sing in your key
We won't be off-key together
We'd be such a lovely sextet
We'll do Lucia di Lammermoor yet
We'll give out with a hot gavotte
- lf Smith plays sweet
- And James plays hot
We'd be the best of all the octettes
We'd dance a ring around the Rockettes
Our Terpsichore is to the pernt
In fact, we've learned to kill the jernt
Two, three, kick
Isn't that redheaded fellow wonderful?
That's me.
- High
- High
- Da-da-da-de-a
- Da-da-da-de-a
- Le-do-dey
- Le-do-dey
High, high, high, high, da, high
I'll take the high note
And you take the low note
And we'll make
We'll make
Sweet music together
Splendid. A great improvement.
Thank you very much.
Well, there you are, professor.
Young man...
...due to circumstances over which I have no control...
...I am forced to give you an A in music.
Gee, you've got the longest eyelashes.
You know,
I dream about you every night.
Gosh, your hair's silky.
Did you every try it in braids?
Come in.
I knew you'd like it in braids.
How dare you come here?
Oh, now.
Rule 113:
"Students are invited at all times to bring to the members of the faculty...
...problems of a personal nature."
Now, I have a problem...
...and it's very personal.
- Well, what is it?
Well, it's about my bed.
What about your bed?
Well, it's cold.
Now, don't tell me you forgot to bring your hot-water bottle.
It's the first thing you packed when we were going on our honeymo...
I'll see that you get another blanket.
Good night, Mr. Elliott.
Oh, I have another problem.
- What is it?
- It's about my bed again.
Not only is it too cold, but...
Well, it's too short.
My foot sticks out. Both of them.
Well, have it cut off. Both of them.
Well, I'd much rather have a bigger bed.
One like the one we were going to buy, you remember?
No. No, I don't remember.
You remembered the hot-water bottle, though.
Oh, brother. What a bed that was.
Carved out of rosewood with little cupids all over it.
You remember it.
It was in that store window in California.
If you miss the bed, why don't you go back to California...
...and sleep in the window.
- I will, if you'll go with me.
Oh, Caroline, you've got to believe me...
Caroline. Oh, Caroline.
Here comes that Evans and that elephant again.
Hey, what's that guy hanging around you for?
Why, we're very dear friends.
In fact, we're more than friends, we're...
We're practically engaged.
Well, congratu...
Engaged?
You're married to me.
I won't be when that annulment comes through.
Caroline, are you there?
Just a moment, Willis, dear.
Willis, dear. You know you're not in love with that creep.
Don't tell me who I'm in love with.
I'm not in love with you.
Now, now, you get out of here.
Go on.
Go ahead, open the door for your lover.
I'll go out of your life through the window...
...into the night.
Oh, get lost. Go on.
- Good evening, Willis.
- Good evening, my dear.
What...? What kept you so long?
Oh, I was just cleaning out my room.
Oh, come, come, come, Duke.
I know we're happy to see Miss Brooks but we must behave like a gentleman.
Sit.
Sit. That's a good boy.
Willis, come sit here next to me. l... I missed you this summer, my dear.
Lake Tillamook wasn't the same without you.
Well, I missed you too, Willis.
I wish I'd gone to Lake Tillamook instead of California.
Really, Caroline.
That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
Oh, Willis, stop teasing.
You know how I feel about you.
Why, Caroline.
Darling, I didn't know.
Duke hasn't been himself ever since that Elliott person registered here.
- Perhaps I'd better investigate.
- Don't bother, dear.
He probably just smells a rat.
Don't you mean a mouse?
No, I mean a rat.
A large rat.
Whatever you say, my dear.
If you don't mind,
I'd like to go to the movies.
There's a double feature in the village tonight.
If we hurry, we can still make it.
Oh, very well, my dear.
But I do hope the pictures are educational.
- You get the car, I'll meet you outside.
- All right.
Oh, and suppose we leave Duke here to keep an eye on the rat?
An excellent suggestion.
Duke, I don't want you to budge from this spot...
...until Miss Brooks and I return from the cinema.
Do you understand?
That's a good boy.
Oh, that's the way we say good night.
If you are not in your room by 9:00,
I will be forced to have you expelled.
Rule 110.
At the sound of the gong, the time will be 8:55.
Bong.
Good night.
Lassie, go home.
- Oh, I'm in the wrong room.
- You certainly are.
- You ought to be in a cell.
- How are you?
You're carrying this girl business too far.
Oh, this. I'm dressed like a dame to escape a Dane.
- What?
- Who told you I was here?
Harry James.
Now, listen, schoolboy.
I'll give you 10 days to finish my score...
...or I'll raise a scandal, it'll blast you out.
- George...
- And the dean and Caroline with you.
- Oh, you wouldn't.
- Oh, wouldn't I?
I'd do anything for my water pageant.
Schubert's the only guy who got away with an unfinished symphony.
Here.
Get busy.
It's no use, George.
Ever since the day I lost Caroline...
...why, I haven't been able to write a line.
I've just been trying to figure out a way...
...to kind of get her back.
If I could get my hands on that woman,
I'd choke the truth out of her.
Somebody put her up to that.
And I'll find out who. And when I do...
Hey, George.
How come you showed up so quick in California?
- Where were you while I was...?
- Steve, it's me, your best friend.
You don't think that after all these years...
- My dear fellow...
- No, it couldn't be. I'm sorry.
- You'll have to forgive me. I'm not myself.
- Steve, listen.
I'm interested in your happiness.
I want you to stay here in this school until you win back your little bride.
I've tried, but it isn't easy.
The professors giving demerits,
Caroline giving dirty looks...
...everybody gives homework.
- Don't worry about it.
I'll help you.
You may not know it but I was expelled from Oxford.
Really?
You can help me with a little homework.
- There's three maps. Wait a minute.
- All right.
Four pages of history...
...five pages of geometry...
...six pages of chemistry...
...ten pages of botany...
...and a thesis on the love life of a plover.
- The what?
- I don't know.
Look, do that for me and get it back in the morning. Will you, George?
Steve, it looks as if
I'm working your way through college.
Yeah. Good night, George.
Hello?
Yes, I placed a long-distance call to Xavier Cugat.
Put him on.
Hello. Hello, Steve, how are you?
Cugie? No, sorry, he's on stage playing that Venezuela number you like.
Want to listen?
Say, Cugie, Steve Elliott's on the phone.
Hello. Hello, Steve.
Hello, Cugie?
Say, your number sounded wonderful.
Have you heard from that crazy woman?
I grieve to tell you we have heard nothing but silence...
...since the day of that incident.
She has vanished into hot air.
I know. I know. I know.
I sympathize with you.
I know your loss was great.
I too sustained a great loss.
When the señorita left, she took my last pair of maracas.
Who cares about maracas?
She took my last pair of nylons.
- Maracas.
- Nylons.
- Nylons, I said.
- All right, maracas.
Fine.
Cugie's lost his maracas,
Lina's lost her nylons...
...and I've lost my Caroline.
"Geometry, 90.
Chemistry, 95.
History, 98."
Oh, well. My... This is awful.
There seems little hope of getting rid of Mr. Elliott scholastically.
How do we stand on demerits?
Professor Evans?
Oh, well, 10 demerits for sleeping through botany.
- Miss Phillips?
- Ten for defacing his map in geography.
- Professor Hendricks?
- Ten demerits for tardiness.
Twenty-five demerits for...
- Go on, my dear.
- For insubordination.
I see.
Anyone else?
Well, that's only 55. A long way from the hundred we need to expel him.
You all realize that each hour that young man remains here...
...our situation becomes more precarious.
There must be some way of stepping up his demerits.
Legitimately, of course.
Dean Clinton, you forget.
Tomorrow the young man starts with me in eurhythmics.
Oh, yes...
...eurhythmics.
That was very, very nice girls, very nice.
Now, the next thing we shall do will be...
Well, come in, Mr. Elliott.
No, I don't think I'd better.
Will you please come in?
We have no time to play the hide-and-the-seek, Mr. Elliott. Come in.
Well, well, well, look who's here.
Mr. Apollo.
Stomach in.
Chest out.
Shoulders back.
Head up.
Girls, line up, please.
One, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and...
Oh, no, no, no, no.
What's the matter?
That was an accident.
My leg won't stretch.
It's all right this way, but this is new to me.
- It won't stretch, huh?
- No, ma'am.
I shall stretch it for you.
Put your arm around there.
Straight. Give me your leg.
Give me your leg.
Up high, high, high, high...
Up. up.
Get up there. Get off of there.
Stomach in. Chest out.
Shoulders back. Head up.
To the bar.
Put your foot on the rail.
Up here. Up here.
You have some pretty tall friends.
Get up there.
Hurry up. Up. Up.
Get off the floor.
Get off the floor.
Stomach in. Chest out.
Shoulders back. Head up.
Girls, line up for the walking exercise.
Is that a way to walk?
Walking isn't up there.
It's here.
Well, I've been using the wrong end for years.
Where is your carriage?
The secret of good carriage is pride.
Each day a woman must say to herself:
"I have a secret.
I am beautiful.
I am beloved."
And she must carry herself as if she believes it.
Watch.
I have a secret.
I am beautiful.
I am beloved.
Now you do it.
- Me?
- Yes, you.
Well, I'd rather not.
You will walk or I will give you demerits.
I'm walking.
I have a secret.
I am beautiful.
- I am beloved.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, Mr. Elliott.
We do not waddle like a duck.
That's the only way I know.
Hold your head up. High. High. High.
- It's hooked on back there.
- Well, hold it up high...
...and act like a proud horse.
Move over, Nell.
That will be 20 demerits for bad stable manners.
Girls, sit down.
How many times have I told you not to eat candies?
You will ruin your shape.
What shape?
The next one I catch eating candies...
And throw away on the floor all the sticky paper...
...will get 25 demerits.
Line up, everybody, for the waltz.
Come on. Hold up.
Lively, make it lively. That's it.
Music.
Well...
...we might as well face it, dear.
Tomorrow is Parents' Day, isn't it?
And in spite of all our efforts,
Mr. Elliott's still here.
I know.
Frankly, I'm at a loss to explain his presence here to the parents.
And as dean of Victoria...
...l'm responsible.
Perhaps...
...if some very attractive young person...
...could arrange an engagement with Mr. Elliott tonight...
...and manage to keep him out after hours...
We might also arrange to have
Professor Evans at the gate...
...to expel the young man when he returns.
Perhaps we could.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...next, we present a musical phenomenon.
Some years ago...
...in a little café in Romania...
...Jascha Heifetz, the famous violinist...
...heard a gypsy fiddler play a selection that made such an impression on his mind...
...that later, he wrote a brilliant adaptation of it.
Tonight, for the first time...
...we present these violin fireworks...
...as transcribed for the trumpet by Harry James.
Ladies and gentlemen...
..."Hora Staccato."
- Darling.
- Yes, dear?
Pinch me, will you?
- What for?
- Never mind. Just pinch me.
Ouch, yeah, it's real.
For a minute,
I thought I was dreaming.
I can't believe it's really me, sitting across from you.
It looks like you.
You know, I nearly gave up a couple of times...
...but then you'd say or you'd do some little thing...
...that made me feel you still cared.
Would I?
I knew once you had time to think...
...you'd never believe the stuff that crazy woman said in California.
Please, Steve,
I'd rather not talk about it.
You know, Caroline...
...when you love someone, you trust them.
No one could ever make me believe anything bad about you.
I want to see Mr. George Adams.
It is very important that I see him.
I'll take care of this. How do you do?
- Glad to see you.
- What about the part?
Why haven't you sent for me?
I will see you in just one minute.
Thank you.
Hey!
Let me out of here. Open that door.
Well, I have our little house all planned.
Now, over here will be the living room.
And here's the fireplace.
We could sit in front of it during the long winter nights...
...and be kind of like this. That's you...
...and, well, this is me.
You're more like...
You know, I used to lie awake nights in the janitor's room...
...sort of dreaming about this.
Now, over here is the dining room...
...with a big bay window and a cupboard for my grandmother's Spode china.
I'm pretty sure she'll give it to us.
You know, my grandmother's gonna love you.
- Do you think so, darling?
- I know so.
Now, over here is the hall with a big winding staircase.
You know how kids like to slide down banisters.
You are planning on children, aren't you?
Yes, darling.
Then what are we waiting for?
Let's go to Victoria College, throw things in the bag...
...and let's get out of here.
Well, you want to, don't you?
Well, yes, dear, of course I do.
But, well...
Well, they're playing one of my favorite songs.
Let's dance awhile first, huh?
Oh, sure.
And now we give you your favorite singing star, Helen Forrest.
I cried for you
Now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road
Has a turning
That's one thing
You're learning
I cried for you
What a fool
I used to be
'Cause I've found two eyes
Just a little bit bluer
And I've found a heart
Just a little bit truer
I cried for you
Now it's your turn
To cry over me
Hey, buddy, do you know how I can get to Victoria College?
- Straight down the road about 20 miles.
- Thanks.
The figure is familiar...
...but I cannot place the voice.
Well, Duke, tonight we have occasion for rejoicing.
Before the cock crows, Mr. Steven Elliott will be out of our lives forever.
- Dear?
- Yes, darling?
There never really was anything between you and that awful woman, was there?
Of course not.
I knew deep down in my heart there couldn't be.
If she were really your wife, she would have had a marriage license.
Of course, there were those three little red-haired boys.
There are millions of redheaded boys all over the world.
I couldn't be the father of all of them.
No, of course not, darling.
Forgive me?
- Are you happy?
- Happy? I'm delirious.
Why shouldn't I be?
Gosh, I've got my wife back,
I'm on the first lap of our honeymoon.
- A man couldn't ask for any more.
- No, only...
It took a long time to walk from that church to the bridal suite.
- But we finally made it, didn't we?
- Well, not quite, dear.
What do you mean?
We're on our way to pack, aren't we?
Well, yes, of course.
But I'm afraid when we get to the gate...
...Willis might not let you in.
Willis might not, why?
Well, you're out after hours...
...and he's waiting to expel you.
I'm gonna knock that petunia-presser right on his trapeoliums.
Hey, wait a minute.
How did he know you were with me?
Oh, l... I don't know, dear.
Unless it's because I told him.
You'd better turn here, dear.
- You told him.
- Oh, look, darling.
I simply had to get you out of school before the parents come tomorrow.
And well, it seemed the only way to do it.
Honey, I didn't know I was gonna fall in love with you all over again...
...and that I'd wanna leave Victoria with you.
Oh, that's different. Come on, let's go.
Oh, no. I can't leave on such short notice.
- It's not fair to Dean Clinton.
- No, we've got to be fair to Dean Clinton.
- Oh, you're not mad, are you?
- Oh, no, I'm as happy as a lark.
You're just going in, I'm staying out.
Nothing to get mad about.
Oh, but, sweetheart.
You know you can't come in.
- Tomorrow's Parents' Day, and...
- Tonight is definitely not Husband's Night.
Besides, you can't get through the gate.
Of course, you could climb over the wall.
Yeah, the wall.
Just to pack your bags, of course.
Oh, of course. Yeah.
Will you come down to the room and help me pack?
Of course.
I'll climb over that wall.
I'll jump over it.
I'll drive through...
...and tell Willis you've left.
He's there. Turn off the lights the minute we burst into the room.
- Right.
- One, two, three...
Go.
Here. Put me down. Put me down.
- Okay, Bunny, we've got him.
- Steven Elliott, your hour has come.
You've been chosen to join the order of the wise and worthy witches of Alpha Nu.
- Okay, kids! Give him the business.
- Now, wait a minute. What...?
Why don't you girls pick on somebody your size?
Gosh, who's that?
I think it's one of your teachers.
- Jeepers. How'll we get out of here?
- You're witches, figure it out for yourself.
Here, what are you doing?
Hey, now, what are you...?
- Hello, Señor Elliott. l...
- Oh, no, not you.
I have to explain to you why I'm here.
It's just that I'm...
Steve, open the door, it's Caroline.
I only want to help.
Hurry, darling.
Sorry, pal, this is taken.
- Oh, goodness.
- Let me down. Let me down.
Let me dow...
Darling, hurry.
- Yes, dear?
- Don't just stand there. Come on.
Carry me over the threshold.
Oh, yeah, the threshold. Well...
Maybe you should come back later.
A week from Wednesday?
Come on, alley-oop.
There we are.
Are you cold, dear?
Yes, I am.
- I'll get you a robe.
- Thanks.
Oh, no, no, it isn't in there.
Oh, oh, is it over here?
No, no, it isn't in here either.
- Well, where?
- Well, I never wear the things.
Well, I'll get your slippers.
No, No. I never wear them, either.
What's that noise?
Suppressed steam.
Sometimes it goes on like that all night.
- Really?
- Yes.
Maybe we'd better go to your house, huh?
No, dear. If you can stand it, I can.
- Oh, I can't.
- Come on, sit down.
Relax.
Now, here we are all alone.
Yeah, all alone.
Just you and I.
Yeah, you and I.
How about a game of pinochle?
Chess?
Checkers?
Cribbage?
Jacks?
Steve, what's the matter with you?
Me? There's nothing the matter with me. l...
Steve, I come to warn you.
- Who do you suppose is here?
- Who do you suppose is here?
Not fair, I asked you first.
Hello, Carlos. How are you?
With the exception of a slight cold, good.
Slight cold.
Come in out of the night air, goodness.
- I'm not intruding?
- No. We're glad to see you. Aren't we?
My, yes. We can have a nice little game of three-handed bridge.
- Good. I'll get the cards.
- I do not play the cards.
- I only play the guitar.
- Let's have a game of guitar.
Look, Carlos, why don't you find yourself an audition somewhere else.
If you've got a bad cold, you'd better take care of it, boy.
Go home and soak your head. Good night.
Don't mind me. I'm broad-minded.
My parents aren't.
- They're on their way over.
- Your parents?
Yes, they got here ahead of time.
We've got to hide, quick.
Hide? What for?
There's nothing wrong here.
Yeah, that's what you think.
I think I hear them coming. Quick, hide.
We mustn't get the dean in trouble.
Let's hide somewhere. The closet.
Okay, No, no, no. not there.
Over here. It's cooler.
- There's something I must tell you.
- Hide.
What are you talking about?
- Get in there.
- Let me out.
But I assure you, Mrs. Allenwood, the young man has already left Victoria.
Nevertheless,
I prefer to see it with my own eyes.
You see, everything is in order.
It seems to be, yes.
You are mistaken about Steve Elliott.
- He's a fine, upstanding young man.
- You.
Evidently, our fears are groundless.
Stuffy.
Who, my parents?
- It seems to be.
- Listen.
We must go back, Alonzo.
I've lost my lorgnette.
Here we go again.
Oh, no, no, no.
- Do you think you dropped it in here?
- I dropped it about here. Oh, there it is.
- Well, you're very fortunate.
- Thank you.
Very.
- Please, I can explain.
- You cellar Casanova.
I can explain, really I can...
Miss Brooks, will you please let me...?
- Oh, my.
- No, put me down.
- Excuse me.
- I know the whole story...
...I just can't live with it.
Let me go.
George, I've ruined everything.
I've embarrassed the dean, disgraced Victoria College...
...and caused Caroline to lose her job.
- You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
- I am.
I came in to say goodbye.
Goodbye?
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.
I'd jump in the river but the water reminds me of Caroline.
But what about my songs?
George, I'll make you a proposition.
Star Caroline in your water pageant...
...l'll see you get the songs for the opening.
Star Caroline?
But she's unknown, Steve.
Well, that's my proposition.
You can take it or leave it.
- Take it? I got to take it.
- Oh, swell, George.
Wait a minute, Steve.
How does she look in a bathing suit?
How does she look in a bathing suit?
Is he kidding?
Hide behind that piece of scenery.
You can see Caroline, she can't see you.
Oh, I know that, but you don't have to rub it in.
Come on, Steve, hurry up. Hurry up.
Oh, Steve, darling, forgive me.
She told me everything.
- Who?
- Me.
I don't...
Please excuse me just a moment.
Excuse me one moment.
What am I doing? I can't swim. Help.

- Good evening, Vercheres.
- Sh!
Oh, good evening, Inspector. You have missed half of the opera, as usual.
- I didn't come to see the opera.
- As usual.
(applause)
- Raoul!
- Christine.
I just got back from Rouen.
No, I must talk to you for a moment.
But I...
Raoul, I shouldn't have left.
Christine, dear,
I hurried over to tell you something.
- What?
- That I love you.
- Again?
- Still.
- What a wonderful audience tonight.
- And you were marvellous, Biancarolli.
We're having supper tonight at the Café de L'Opéra.
- I'm sorry, Raoul, but I can't tonight.
- Why not?
Chris? Christine!
- I'm coming, Jenny.
- If you've another engagement, break it.
You've had your fling at this for two years.
But I don't want to give up the opera, not until I've had a chance to really sing.
Anatole says he has great faith in my voice, and he's going to help me.
Naturally. That's what baritones are for(!)
- You were in wonderful voice tonight.
- Thank you, Marcel.
Christine! Why weren't you on the stage for the end of the act?
- You're all right?
- Oh, yes.
Mademoiselle DuBois, come here please.
Don't worry.
Why weren't you onstage for the curtain calls?
- Well, erm, I was ill...
- No, you were not.
You were entertaining a friend.
A friend, mind you!
For a singer to absent herself from the stage during a performance is a gross breach of...
- Oh. You wish to talk to me, monsieur?
- With your permission,
I'd like a few words with MIle DuBois in my office after the performance.
- Yes, she will be there.
- Thank you.
- Now, you bear in mind what I told you.
- Yes, monsieur.
Terrifying fellow, that Vercheres, when he wants to be.
I'm very grateful, monsieur. I promise you
I'll never miss a curtain call again.
It's a promise. Now, uh, this young man who is more important to you than your career... Who is he?
But he isn't, monsieur. That is,
I am very fond of him. I mean...
Oh.
Well, he's Inspector
Raoul Daubert of the Sûreté.
Inspector? You mean a policeman?
Oh, but he's not an ordinary policeman.
Even an extraordinary policeman seems a strange sweetheart for a soprano.
Does he sing?
I'm afraid you don't understand, monsieur.
He's a graduate of the military academy at Saint-Cyr, and he's very intelligent and very clever.
For a man who means nothing to you, he seems to have made quite an impression.
Oh, but I didn't say he meant nothing to me. What I said was...
I know. I know what you mean.
You have promise, Mademoiselle DuBois, but you must choose between an operatic career and what is usually called "a normal life".
Though why it is so-called is beyond me.
You can't do justice to both.
The artist has a special temperament, and he must live his life exclusively with those who understand it.
I understand, monsieur.
You'll find that music has its compensations, my dear. Good night.
Good night, and thank you.
Oh, mademoiselle, please tell Mr Claudin to come in. He's in the anteroom.
Certainly. Good night.
Good evening. Monsieur Villeneuve asks that you come in now.
Thank you, mademoiselle.
Mademoiselle, may I speak to you for a minute?
Certainly.
You weren't on the stage tonight for the third-act curtain calls.
Everyone in the theatre seems to have noticed it. It's really quite flattering.
Why weren't you there?
Oh, forgive me, but I've been here so long that you...
Everybody, everything connected with the Opera is so much a part of my life.
Of course... But Mr Villeneuve is waiting.
Yes.
You weren't ill, were you?
You're not in any trouble?
It's impertinent of me, I know, but, uh...
You're very kind.
Good night.
Uh, Christine!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Good night.
Good night.
- (knocking)
- (Villeneuve) Come in, please.
You know why I sent for you, Claudin?
I think so, Maestro.
For some time now I have sensed discord in the violin section.
It was not until tonight that I definitely located the source of the trouble.
Let me hear you play, if you please, Claudin.
Yes, Maestro.
(# mournful tune)
- What was that, Claudin?
- A little song.
A lullaby, from Provence, where I was born.
You played it very well.
Perhaps I was wrong.
No, it was you.
What's the matter?
You're an accomplished musician.
Come, come, now.
Let me hear you play the opening movement in the third act of Martha. 
It's no use, Maestro. Something has happened to the fingers of my left hand.
- But you played that lullaby perfectly.
- It's a simple melody, Maestro.
That's why I played it.
You were trying to fool me, eh, Claudin?
Well, perhaps it's only temporary.
Perhaps it'll get better.
I hope so, but in the meantime...
You know, Claudin, the aim of the Paris Opera is perfection.
I'm sorry, old fellow, very sorry. You've been with us a long time, haven't you?
20 years.
What am I to do, Maestro?
I know it's hard, Claudin.
No doubt you've saved a tidy little fortune to retire on.
- Yes, of course.
- In appreciation of your long service,
I shall arrange with the directors to have a season ticket issued to you.
Thank you, Maestro.
(knock at door)
(door opens)
Why don't you eat before the opera, instead of keeping me up all hours?
You're rich enough. Same soup, night after night, week after week.
- Please don't disturb yourself, Marie.
- You're a fine one to say that!
Why wouldn't I be disturbed?
I'll come right to the point.
What you do with your money is not my business.
If you want to hoard it and starve, it's your affair.
But you haven't paid me for six weeks, and that's as long as I'm going to wait.
I haven't any money.
If you'll be patient, just a little longer...
You haven't any money? After working for the Paris Opera all these years?
What will you do with your money?
Bury it with you?
If you do, they'll dig you up and steal it.
If you think you can add a few francs to your fortune at my expense, you're very much mistaken.
Marie, you've been very kind, you've been very patient. You'll be paid, I promise you.
Now please leave me alone.
It makes me sick to think of all that money doing nobody any good.
Either I get my money or out you go.
That's my last word, Claudin.
(# sings ascending scale)
(bell tinkles)
You're late, Mr Claudin.
The lesson is almost over.
I didn't come about that today, mademoiselle.
- She's not in voice.
- I'll tell Signor Ferretti.
- Please don't interrupt the lesson.
- Of course not. I understand.
But I must announce the time to Signor
Ferretti, or he'll keep students for hours.
- It's 11 o'clock, Signor Ferretti.
- Thank you.
Mademoiselle, you disappoint me.
I'm sorry. I'm a little upset.
If a man is upsetting you, pitch him out of your life. Music is first.
- Music is everything.
- I understand.
You don't understand. Women never understand. But they are docile.
Perhaps you're not getting enough sleep.
Come later tomorrow, say midday.
Thank you, monsieur.
Remember you have responsibilities to others as well as yourself.
I know.
I can never repay you for what you've done for me.
- Good day, monsieur.
- Good day.
Would you come this way, monsieur?
Monsieur Claudin is here, Signor Ferretti.
Come in, Claudin, come in.
- Won't you sit down a moment?
- Thank you.
I suppose you noticed your protégée was disappointing today?
Well, an off day now and then.
You've done a lot for her, Signor.
Nevertheless, she is making definite progress, eh?
I was dismissed from the orchestra last night.
Oh. Then you will have to withdraw your support for Mademoiselle DuBois?
Only for a little while, just until
I can secure another position.
I had hoped that you would continue to instruct her.
Claudin, if you don't mind me saying so, you are a fool.
A man of your age might win a girl like Christine DuBois if he happened to be the director of an opera company, but a poor violinist...
We agreed never to discuss my motives.
Please, won't you continue to work with her?
Why should I assume your burden, after you spent all your money on her?
She means nothing to me.
But her career means more to me than anything else.
I would never let you lose anything on her account.
I'm sorry, Claudin, really sorry.
If I had time... But my expenses are great.
And you must remember there are many who can pay waiting to study with me.
I'll let her come a few times, and then
I will tell her she no longer needs me.
But that isn't true.
As a matter of fact, if you had the money, she might be launched on a career soon.
I assume that MIle DuBois has not the means to pay for her own instructions?
A month's salary wouldn't be enough to pay for one of your lessons.
But... I have written a concerto.
Will you trust me if I can arrange to have it published?
Every violinist has written a concerto!
Come, come, my dear Claudin.
But I have faith in this one, as much faith as I had in MIle DuBois when I came three years ago.
Now, I was right about her,
Signor, and I'm right about this.
Pleyel and Desjardins will publish it, and they'll give me a substantial advance. You'll see!
(man) It's a shame.
Pleyel's in there with his etchings.
Why don't they tell the poor devil he won't see anyone, instead of torturing him?
Claudin?
He'll see me?
No. He is too busy today.
- Has he seen my manuscript?
- Manuscript? What manuscript?
- My concerto.
- I know nothing about it.
- But you took the portfolio into him.
- If I did, you will receive it in due time.
Now, my dear, the acid. Be careful, or you'll burn yourself horribly.
- Monsieur Pleyel?
- What are you doing here?
- I've been waiting since this morning.
- Weren't you told I couldn't see anyone?
Yes, but my manuscript.
I must find out about my manuscript.
Give this fellow his manuscript, Georgette.
You'll find it on the desk, if it's anywhere.
- What is your name?
- Uh, Claudin. Erique Claudin.
Claudin...
No, it wouldn't be there. It's a large manuscript in a portfolio. It's a concerto.
- I'm sorry, but I don't know where it is.
- But it must be here.
Well, if it is, it will turn up.
You might call again in a few days.
You don't understand. It's my only copy.
It represents two years' work.
- You heard what the lady said.
- But it was brought in.
It must be here. It must be found.
Did we ask you to bring your music to us, Claudin?
I've seen samples of your compositions before.
Perhaps some employee has thrown it into the wastebasket, where it belongs.
Good night!
(# piano playing)
- Do you think I was right, Monsieur Liszt?
- It's magnificent. Tell me his name again.
- Erique Claudin.
- Claudin?
I've tried for years to persuade
Pleyel to publish his work, but you know
Pleyel and unknown composers.
Pleyel will publish this, I promise.
(continues playing piano)
That's my music.
I thought I told you to get out.
Thief!
You've stolen my music.
- Thief!
- (Georgette) Maurice!
- You're choking him!
- You've stolen my music!
Thief! Thief!
- (Pleyel chokes)
- You've stolen my music!
What happened?
- Stop him!
- What's happened?
Monsieur Pleyel's been murdered by that madman, Claudin! Get a doctor, quickly!
You, get a doctor. Call the police!
Get a doctor! Call the police!
Police! Police!
- What happened?
- Monsieur Pleyel has been murdered!
- He ran down that way.
- Come on, let's go!
Not here.
Sorry, monsieur.
Move on, and don't come back into this district tonight.
(howls)
Lecours, how were we ever induced to accept the management of this place?
It's not an opera house. It's a madhouse.
And now this:
"Wanted for murder: Erique Claudin, former violinist at Paris Opera House."
"Age 48 years, height 5ft 8in."
"The face has recently been disfigured by acid."
It's an outrage.
After 20 years with the Paris Opera, this miserable Claudin has the insolence to commit a murder.
After 20 years with the Paris Opera,
- A man is capable of anything, Amiot.
- (knock on door)
Come in, come in, come in!
Monsieur, there is a thief in the opera house.
A costume has been stolen, and two masks.
Impossible. The wardrobe woman must have lost them.
- She should have been dismissed.
- She's too fat.
That's not all. The thief has broken into the restaurant.
- The restaurant?
- Yes, monsieur. There is missing a...
There is missing a bucket of pickled pigs' feet in vinegar, a ham and a pâté.
Call the police. This must be stopped.
Monsieur, I am afraid the police can't stop that. It's he.
Who?
Oh, please don't start that nonsense again, Vercheres.
You ought to know there aren't any ghosts.
Monsieur, you are sceptical, but
I don't like ghosts. I am a busy man.
What's that?
Our brilliant stage manager insists there's a malicious ghost prowling about.
If anything goes wrong, he thinks this ghost did it.
Oh, monsieur...
- It has a long nose and a big, red beard.
- You make me nervous.
It's gone!
Did you hear that, Lecours?
My master key is gone.
Do you realise what that means, Lecours?
With that key in his possession, the thief can open 2500 doors, to say nothing of thousands of closets and cabinets.
Perhaps the pickled pigs' feet will kill him.
Oh, you don't seem to understand.
Why, he can hide everywhere.
The entire police force couldn't find him.
You don't realise the extent of this place.
You've never troubled to find out.
Why should I? I have troubles enough.
- What are you waiting for? Get the police!
- Yes, monsieur.
A pâté, a ham, pickled pigs' feet and 2500 rooms!
What is the Opera coming to?

- Monsieur Daubert.
- Madame.
They call this rehearsing, monsieur.
Well, I'm sorry to intrude, but I must see you, Christine.
- Well, you see I'm busy right now...
- Christine!
Please remember that you are speaking to a gentleman.
Well, uh...
- Come in, Raoul.
- Rehearsals!
Anatole... Well, he's been helping me.
- Monsieur's very kind.
- Not at all, monsieur. I find it a pleasure.
- I'm Anatole Garron of the Opera.
- I'm so sorry.
This is Inspector Daubert, of the Sûreté.
I've heard of you, Inspector.
Your work must be very exciting.
Oh, not so exciting as yours, monsieur.
It doesn't lend itself to self-expression.
I didn't recognise that delightful song you were singing.
But as you know,
I am no connoisseur of the opera.
It's not from an opera, Raoul. It's a lullaby.
A lullaby?
It didn't seem very effective, as a lullaby.
Well, you see, Monsieur Inspector, a song is capable of many interpretations,
- By a musician.
- By a detective, too.
Though no doubt the detective is usually mistaken.
I must see you alone, Christine.
I'm here on business from the Sûreté.
With me?
What business could mademoiselle have with the Sûreté?
What is it, Raoul?
If you don't mind,
I'd rather Anatole stayed.
Very well, Christine.
- You know Erique Claudin?
- Why, yes.
How well?
I knew him only as a violinist in the orchestra.
I encountered him a few times in the foyer or on the stage or outside the Opera, but that's all.
He acted a little strangely, but I assumed he was that way with everybody.
- Strangely?
How do you mean, "strangely"?
Well... I don't know.
He just seemed... eccentric, but harmless.
I thought he was a rather kind old fellow, until I read of the murder.
- What is it, Raoul?
- He was a kind and inoffensive man.
Until he thought Pleyel was stealing his life's work.
Then something snapped, and he became a homicidal maniac.
In his state, he may commit other murders.
It's urgent that we capture him as soon as possible.
But what has all this to do with me?
We found something in his room that connects you with him.
No doubt you can explain.
So that's what became of it!
- Be good enough to explain yourself.
- Certainly. That statuette is mine.
- Yours?
- Definitely. I made it.
- I intended to make you a present of it.
- How nice of you, Anatole.
It disappeared from my dressing room.
It's an extraordinary likeness.
My compliments on your versatility, monsieur.
You must have posed for this many times. Every detail is you.
I never posed for it, not once.
- You did this from drawings?
- And from memory, Monsieur Inspector.
To see Christine is to carry her image in your heart and mind for ever.
- Claudin must have stolen it.
- Why?
Isn't it obvious?
Well, speaking purely as an inspector of the Sûreté, even the obvious often needs confirmation.
But as a man, Mr Daubert, you can understand that sitting there in the orchestra pit night after night and looking at Christine,
Claudin probably fell in love with her.
You admit that is possible, no?
Christine, did Claudin ever seek more than a casual acquaintance with you?
No, never.
Can you imagine so diffident a lover, monsieur? Claudin was barely 50.
Well, no doubt he lacked... assurance.
No doubt.
- This is yours, Christine.
- You're giving it to me?
- Yes.
- Well!
Then I'll accept it as a gift from both of you.
Well, I seem to have got the worst of this bargain.
In the future, Monsieur Inspector,
I detect, you model.
- In any case, that was a bad clue.
- Oh, not so bad as it seems.
It enabled me to recover mademoiselle's statuette.
Thank you, Raoul.
Is that your carriage at the door, monsieur?
Why, yes.
Would you be good enough to give me a lift?
- Where are you going?
- It doesn't matter.
As inspector of police,
I have business all over Paris.
Yes, well, in that case...
- Au revoir,  Christine.
- Au revoir. 
You've been most helpful, Christine.
- I hope you catch him soon.
- Thank you.
- Ready, monsieur?
- At your service.
- After you, monsieur.
- After you,  monsieur.
(laughs)
(orchestra tuning up)
- Madame looks beautiful tonight.
- Don't I always, Yvette?
But especially tonight. Monsieur Garron, if he has eyes in his head...
- (knocking)
- (man) Madame Biancarolli!
Thank you! Madame...
(practises vocal exercises)
Good evening.
Marcel, do you think
I lead an enviable life?
- Yes, monsieur.
- I do, but not for the reasons you think.
I'm a very happy man because I'm having supper tonight with Mademoiselle DuBois.
(Claudin) Christine?
You're going to be a great and famous singer. I'll help you.

(Garron) Christine, you're going to be a great and famous singer. I'll help you.
- What's the matter?
- Someone just said the same thing to me
- A moment ago, in my room.
- Someone? Who?
I don't know. It was... just a voice.
- I knew you'd hear me sooner or later.
- It was you?
Of course. I don't mean actually, but I've been saying it ever since I saw you and heard you sing. At last you heard me.
- Your cue, monsieur.
- I'll tell you again at supper.
Armand, Duc de Montaigne.

What is it, madame?
I don't know. I...
Help me!
Monsieur Vercheres!
Oh, madame!
You, get a doctor, quickly.
Take her to her dressing room.
- What could have happened?
- What?
Ohh!
MIle DuBois, you must go on at once.
Madame Biancarolli has been taken ill.
Please get changed quickly. Claire!
Where is that clumsy wardrobe woman?
Claire, get MIle DuBois changed at once.
There isn't a moment to lose.
She was drugged, there's no doubt.
- Who the devil would want to drug her?
- I'm sure she overate.
- You're certain she'll recover, Dr Lefours?
- Definitely.
What am I doing here?  I...
I should be onstage. I...
- Doctor!
- Madame...
She'll be all right now.
Camarades, I'empereur nous appelle. 
(# Christine sings)
Why is she singing?
What is she doing out there?
- What's happened?
- Madame, control yourself.
- I assure you...
- Come to the point, Amiot.
You were seized with a touch of indigestion.
As your understudy,
MIle DuBois took your place.
A touch of indigestion! Why, I was perfectly well when I went on the stage.
Why, I was drugged!
And you all know by whom.
Anatole Garron did it to make room for that baggage!
- Madame, consider what you're saying,
- Madame, please compose yourself.
I demand Garron's arrest.
And hers too. She had a hand in it.
I demand an investigation!
- Let me go!
- Madame, consider our position.
You were wonderful!
(cheering)
I assure you, monsieur. The property man swears that there was no opportunity for any human being to tamper with the drink.
Monsieur Inspector, what are you waiting for?
I demand the arrest of Anatole Garron.
You know he did it.
I know nothing of the sort, madame.
I am a police officer, not a psychic.
It is my duty to collect evidence, without prejudice.
Haven't you evidence enough?
Everyone knows...
Madame!
Will you be seated, please?
Mr Garron, you had the opportunity to put the drug in Madame Biancarolli's glass.
Certainly, Monsieur Inspector.
We all did.
- It becomes, then, a question of motive.
- The motive is very simple, monsieur.
He wanted to get me out of the way so he could make room for that...
- Are you referring to MIle DuBois?
- I am.
You heard, Monsieur Garron.
Madame is in good voice... and most explicit.
Have you anything to say, monsieur?
I deny madame's accusation.
Do you deny, monsieur, that you had any motive in drugging madame?
I deny that I drugged her.
I don't understand your reluctance to make the arrest, Inspector.
- You're not an examining magistrate.
- Can you substantiate that Mr Garron had a motive, and that the motive was MIle DuBois?
- Anyone with half an eye could tell you...
- Hearsay is not evidence, madame.
I'll go over your head, Monsieur Daubert.
I have influence at the Sûreté.
I was drugged tonight to the point of death.
I insist upon the arrest of the criminal and his accomplice.
- And if you don't, I...
- One moment, madame, please.
You have heard Mr Garron deny that he drugged you.
As the inspector says, there is no evidence.
- And remember, madame...
- Are you suggesting that I...
If you insist upon his arrest and fail to obtain a conviction, you will find yourself in a very difficult predicament.
- Quite right.
- And no matter what the outcome, don't forget that your career is bound to the Paris Opera.
Whatever scandal injures us, or any member of the company,
- Will injure you as well.
- (Lecours) Precisely.
Are you suggesting that
I forget the whole affair?
Yes. For your own sake, as well as ours, and purely as a matter of business expediency.
That is exactly what we propose, madame.
(Lecours) Exactly.
Very well.
That is, under certain conditions.
I want a new understudy.
Christine DuBois goes back to the chorus and stays there for the two years my contract has to run.
I won't permit such an outrage!
If any such arrangement is made, I'II...
- Now, madame...
- My dear Anatole, I have not finished.
You suggest I forget
I was drugged tonight?
- Madame.
- Very well. I'll go a step further.
I suggest that you forget anything happened afterwards.
- For once, madame, I do not understand.
- Oh, monsieur, it's so simple.
Nothing happened tonight. I wasn't drugged and Christine DuBois didn't sing.
- But...
- There are always critics in the house.
You'll send word to the papers that no mention of her is to be made.
You'll do nothing of the sort.
It's ridiculous.
Besides, what about the public, madame?
Shall we send word to the public to forget that MIle DuBois was a sensation?
If you're willing to ruin the Opera for the sake of Christine DuBois, it's your affair.
But you'll either do as I say, or I'll charge both of them with trying to murder me.
Do you understand that? Murder me!
- Madame was magnificent tonight.
- I was good, wasn't I?
Monsieur Garron must be biting his nails.
Ah, let him. He'll come crawling back to me on his hands and knees, confessing the whole thing and begging my forgiveness.
Madame!
Who are you?
Christine DuBois will sing tomorrow night.
Leave Paris. This is your last warning.
Take off that prop-room mask.
(screaming)
- What was that?
- I don't know.
- (man) Something must have happened.
- Silence, please.
- (woman) What happened?
- Sh! Monsieur?
Madame Biancarolli and her maid have been murdered.
Murdered?!
- Are you hurt, monsieur?
- What happened? What were you doing?
- I was chasing him.
- Chasing whom?
The murderer, of course.
There was someone else up there?
Certainly. Everyone must have seen...
You saw him yourself, didn't you?
No, monsieur. I was chasing you. 
How long will the Opera remain closed, Inspector?
- Yes, how long?
- I do not know.
- Any suspects?
- Yes, whom do you suspect?
- No one.
- What is your theory on the motive?
I am not a theorist. All I can say is that as long as the opera house remains closed, everyone in Paris, in all France, will think only of the murder, hounding us to make an arrest.
Inspector Daubert.
I came directly I got your message.
What has happened now?
Listen to this, monsieur.
"Christine DuBois must replace
Biancarolli, who ignored my warning."
I found this mysteriously placed on my desk after we got back from supper.
There is an excellent suggestion in this, monsieur. You must reopen the Opera.
- But your orders...
- Are countermanded. Reopen.
- With MIle DuBois, monsieur?
- Of course! It should pacify this madman.
If he doesn't harm anybody, his being in the building doesn't matter.
- Christine DuBois must not sing.
- What?
And the murderer must not remain in the building.
- It is my duty to apprehend him.
- I don't understand.
If Christine DuBois sings, that will satisfy the murderer, and he may never appear.
To lure him from his hiding place, someone else must sing.
Are you suggesting we reopen the Opera with a murder as an added attraction?
- Please, Lecours...
- I'll post police throughout the building.
Even with the chorus onstage, with a bodyguard for the singer.
- But, monsieur, our reputation...
- I am reluctant to do this, monsieur.
Particularly on MIle DuBois' account, but I can see no other way.
And whom do you suggest as "bait",
Monsieur Inspector?
Whomever you decide.
Madame Lorenzi.
She has nerve, that woman.
- Too much.
- Very well, then.
- The Opera will reopen.
- Yes, monsieur.
(bell)
- Oh.
- (both) Good morning, Christine.
- Good morning.
- (both) May I come in, Christine?
Yes, do.
- Well?
- (both) Christine, I...
- Yes?
- (both) If I might have a word...?
- Well, what is it?
- After you, monsieur.
- (both) Christine, I...
- Well, now, one at a time, please!
You first, Anatole, as your name begins with an A.
They're going to reopen the Opera.
At last we will sing...
You are wrong, monsieur.
I'm sorry, Christine.
They are going to reopen the Opera, but without you.
Circumstances connected with the murder demand that someone else sing the leading role.
- But Anatole...
- You may like to know, monsieur, that circumstances connected with the murder demand that she does sing.
Really? I am aware that your profession requires a certain self-assurance,
- But aren't you going too far?
- Not at all.
I have a plan for apprehending the murderer.
- So you have turned detective, monsieur?
- I have.
Very well, if it amuses you, but I advise you to confine your hobby to the entertainment of your friends.
Well, let's not waste words, monsieur.
I've been assured by
Messrs Amiot and Lecours that as soon as the Opera reopens,
MIle DuBois will sing.
And I might add that my plan is strictly confidential.
I'm sorry, but in my official capacity
I ordered Messrs Amiot and Lecours not to permit you to sing.
- But Raoul...
- At least, not for the present.
And I am not in the least interested in your plan.
May I have a word with you alone?
That's what I came for.
May I speak to you alone?
- But... I'm going out.
- (both) My carriage is outside.
Well, I'm not going right now.
I mean... I'm going later.
(both) I'll wait.
Mr Villeneuve suggested you'd perform this service in the cause of justice.
Do you think Claudin would be tempted to leave his hiding place and risk his life merely to hear his own concerto?
Played by Franz Liszt himself?
Do you doubt it, Maestro?
So many crimes have been committed in the name of music.
It seems only fair to use it now to avert one.
- I am at your service, monsieur.
- Thank you, Maestro. Thank you.
Most exciting, this detective work, most exciting.
It's more than exciting to me. I had the honour of being suspected of the crime.
Monsieur Daubert, please.
- Listen, monsieur.
- Another note.
How this phantom knows everything is beyond me.
"If Madame Lorenzi sings, you are responsible for what happens."
Our plan is working.
I don't like it, monsieur. What will become of the Paris Opera? Police everywhere!
- How is Madame Lorenzi?
- Oh, she's enjoying it.
- Nothing would keep her from singing.
- Well, you know how opera singers are.
With your matron in her dressing room and that fellow of yours waiting to escort her to the stage, she feels quite important.
Madame Lorenzi,
I trust you are entirely composed?
Composed?
What are you talking about? Why not?
- Maestro!
- The piano has been tuned, Maestro.
- When do we introduce the concerto?
- Probably after the opera.
Inspector Daubert has a plan of his own, and we must give it every chance.
You may enjoy seeing the opera from the orchestra pit.
I'll be quite comfortable here.
I can look through the score.
- Excuse me. The overture.
- Thank you again, Maestro.
Remain onstage throughout the performance.
Make yourselves inconspicuous, and be on the alert for anything suspicious.
The only persons backstage are the members of the opera company, all of whom you know. Now, that is all.
(# overture begins)
Christine, I'd rather you'd stayed at home.
You understand why
I asked them not to let you sing?
But I couldn't stay away.
We're introducing a new opera
- And Madame Lorenzi's a great artist...
- And Anatole Garron is the baritone!
I'm sorry, Christine, but I'm concerned about what may happen tonight.
I know. I am too.
Wait for me, please, in your dressing room.
(# singing in Russian)
Sorry.
He's here, Gerard. He murdered one of our men and stole his cape.
He's probably wearing a mask.
Watch everyone closely.
Of course, monsieur.
Sorry.
(# singing in Russian)
(# sings in Russian)
(# Madame Lorenzi sings)
(screams)
(screaming and shouting)
What is it?
Come with me, mademoiselle.
Are you one of the police?
- Where is Inspector Daubert?
- Investigating the accident.
I will look after you.
- You're not one of the police.
- I'll watch over you.
- I've always watched over you. Come.
- (screams)
- (screams)
- Sh!
Shh.
You'll stay here with me, my child, won't you?
It's been so Ionely without you, but you've come to me at last, haven't you?
Now you'll sing for me, and I'll play, and we'll be together for ever.
It's beautiful down there.
Beautiful.
Come now, my little one.
Christine!
- Where's Christine?
- I don't know. Isn't it horrible?
- Hasn't she been here?
- I haven't seen her.
There. You're not frightened now, are you?
You know I'll not harm you, don't you?
How could I harm you?
I've always helped you, haven't I?
- Yes.
- Yes what?
Yes, you've always helped me.
Of course I have. Biancarolli knows.
She wouldn't let you sing.
She didn't know how much I love you.
Now she knows.
But it doesn't matter now. Nothing matters except you and me, Christine.
Now you'll sing all you want... but only for me.
You will, won't you, my darling?
Of course.
There's a piano in the Opera foyer.
Let's go there.
You play and I'll sing for you.
But you don't understand.
We can't go back there... ever.
It was I who made the chandelier fall. l, for you, Christine.
But I warned them. I said there'd be death and destruction if they didn't let you sing.
Come.
See? Didn't I tell you it was beautiful?
You didn't know we had a lake all to ourselves, did you?
They've poisoned your mind against me.
That's why you're afraid.
Look at your lake, Christine. You'll love it here, when you get used to the dark.
And you'll love the dark too.
It's friendly and peaceful.
It brings rest, and relief from pain.
It's right under the Opera. The music comes down and the darkness distils it, cleanses it of the suffering that made it, then it's all beauty.
And life here is like a resurrection.
This is more than just a performance of a new concerto.
The future of the Paris Opera may depend upon it.
- Garron, have you seen Christine?
- No, she's at home.
She came to the opera house earlier this evening. Now she's disappeared.
Play, Maestro. Play.
Christine? Christine!
Christine! Christine!
Christine!
George, you two search that passageway.
Gerard, go that way.
Be careful.
This madman may do anything now.
Christine!
Christine!
(# Claudin's concerto begins)
My concerto!
(# plays along with concerto)
Liszt is playing.
That was a brilliant idea of yours, Garron.
Claudin may be up there now, listening.
That sounds in front of us.
It is in front of us.
The whole place is ready to crumble.
Sing, Christine.
Sing!
Don't move.
- The whole place is caving in.
- The shots must have started it.
He called that his concerto, and yet it's written around the melody of my song.
- Who was he?
- He came from your district, in Provence.
Everybody there must have known that old folk song.
He was almost a stranger to me, and yet... somehow I always felt drawn to him with a kind of pity, understanding.
His suffering and madness will be forgotten.
His music, his concerto, will remain.
I'm glad he heard it, before he...
Poor Claudin.
Oh, mademoiselle, you were magnificent tonight!
Thank you, Celeste. I was good, wasn't I?
Oh, wonderful!
- (knock on door)
- Celeste!
Monsieur.
You were magnificent, Christine!
- Incomparable, beautiful-a sensation!
- Is that all?
I've just begun. It would take days and years to tell you how superb you were.
We're having supper tonight at the Café de L'Opéra.
Well, I'm terribly sorry,
Anatole, but I can't tonight.
Why not? Have you another engagement?
- Yes.
- With whom?
With Raoul.
- That policeman?
- (knock at door)
- Come in.
- Christine!
- Oh.
- Oh.
(both) Christine...
- You two know each other, of course.
- (both) Of course.
How soon will you be ready?
The carriage is waiting.
- I know Monsieur Garron will excuse us.
- Anatole has just asked me to supper too.
No doubt. You won't be long, will you, Christine?
I have an idea. Why can't we three have supper together? It's all ordered, isn't it?
I am not in the habit of taking baritones to supper.
And I do not care to be seen in public with the police.
Christine, you'll have to make up your mind finally between us.
Precisely.
(Vercheres)
Don't push, monsieur! Oh, no, no.
- Excuse... Mademoiselle...
- Excuse me.
Don't push, monsieur, please!
Will you join me for a bit of supper at the Café de L'Opéra?
With pleasure, monsieur.
Think we can get through this crowd?
Certainly. After all, who'd pay any attention to a baritone and a detective?
Quite right.
- After you, monsieur.
- After you,  monsieur.
Don't let anyone out.
Cops.
Take it easy, folks.
Don't anyone leave.
Stand where you are.
Don't touch a thing.
Joe, hold the sealers and housemen.
Let the others go.
- Okay.
- Come along.
Let's get out of here, quick.
All right, folks.
Please go home quickly and quietly.
Sorry to spoil your fun, but this place is closed.
- Okay, girls, you're through.
- We're not leaving until we get paid.
You'll have a long wait.
Your boss took a run-out powder.
- Go on, change your clothes.
- Take your big paws off me.
Then beat it or I'll throw you all in the tank.
You can't do that.
We have nothing to do with the gambling.
You knew it was going on and didn't report it. You're accessories. Come on.
We're not accessories any more than the people who come here.
We're just trying to earn our living, same as you are...
...and we’d like to be paid before we leave.
Bravo.
The little lady's right, officer, and you know it.
How'd you like to dance your feet off for a jaded public and not get paid?
Citizens of Akron,
I appeal to your well-known generosity.
Let's take up a collection for these innocent victims of a man's avarice.
I'll start it with $14.
Now, who's next?
Thanks, officer. That's the old spirit.
I never expected to find you here,
Mr. Harris.
Now, who else has some old spirit?
Thank you, boys. Thank you.
How about the ladies? Thank you too.
Thank you, everybody.
This is the finest demonstration...
...of something or other that I've ever seen.
Maybe there's lots of things you haven't seen.
Maybe.
Thank you.
Thank you all.
Thank you very much.
Come on, boys.
May I have this dance?
It's my favorite number.
Lose something, Bubbles, dear?
What's the big rush?
Of course, I could go on forever, but the piccolo's a little dry.
You've got a funny face.
I mean, this is a funny place for your face.
- Seems a grand place when we landed it.
- Irish?
Once removed.
You know...
...you look like a star. The one that keeps shining after all the others have quit.
You know, the morning star.
That's a very nice thing to say.
I'm a very nice fellow.
Well, then what are you doing in a place like this?
I'm having a swell time, and I'm going on having a swell time.
Miss Irish, this is a very special occasion.
I'm celebrating something.
Something important.
I don’t think you are.
What?
Having a good time, even if you are celebrating.
There are celebrations and celebrations.
You wouldn’t understand.
You have blue eyes.
I don’t like girls with blue eyes.
Mind if I take over?
Hello, handsome, what goes on under your hat?
It was just telling me to find that gorgeous blond.
I always was a mind reader.
- Good night, boys.
- Good night.
Good night.
Bubbles just burns me.
She's got all the men she wants.
She have to run off with the one you really like?
Oh, forget it.
Anyway...
...the only thing I really care about is dancing.
Well, he can't be so much or he wouldn't fall for her.
He doesn’t like Bubbles, not really.
Have it your own way.
Good night.
Sally's asleep.
So what?
Back kind of early, aren't you?
Oh, that guy.
He took me to the Ritz Bar.
Everything was going along swell...
...when all of a sudden, he spots this thing on the floor, and he goes completely cuckoo.
He plants it on me and tells me to be good to it, and he walks out.
"Be good to Ferdinand," he says.
- It's cute.
- You can have it.
I'll say one thing for you, Pavlova.
You've certainly got ambition, even if it's dumb.
You know, I got ambition too.
Only I don’t have to crack my joints to get where I'm going. I got brains.
Your brains told you how you'll get back to New York tomorrow?
Oh, yeah.
Gee, if only that guy tonight...
Oh, well. Let's see, there's Jerry.
Oh, no, Jerry's out.
Found out he has a wife.
Stu Martin.
I's rather walk.
Sam. That's the traveling salesman that's so sweet on me.
He's got a roadster.
He's starting East tomorrow.
Wouldn’t there be room for Sally?
He's a fur salesman, not a mother.
All right, she can go, but don’t blame me.
That guy's got more arms than an octopus.
- Nanette.
- He's here. Mr. Harris, your husband.
"Monsieur," I said, "consider madam.
She bought a ticket for Reno.
You can't come here."
- Well, where is he?
- In there. In your boudoir, Madam.
Don't go in, Madame.
Remember, the lawyer told you...
...not to see him before the divorce.
Jimmy.
You know you have no right to come here.
We're not supposed to be friendly for six weeks and a day.
Who says we're friendly?
What were you doing in the Ritz Bar, Elinor?
You're going in for espionage.
You left Ferdinand on the floor where he could be kicked around.
Oh, dear, did I? Where's he now?
Did you bring him home?
No, I didn’t. You don’t deserve him,
So I gave him away.
You didn’t.
Oh, but, Jimmy, he was our...
Our Ferdinand.
- Do you remember the night we got him?
- Sure, the Club Ferdinand.
You insist on wearing that silly little short jacket.
Sure makes the air warmer.
Always told you that.
Anyway, it was a beautiful night.
Jimmy, I...
Well...
...so long.
Have a good trip.
Oh, won't you have a drink before you go?
Certainly.
Nanette.
- Drinks, Nanette.
- The usual?
- Of course.
- Yes, sir.
Well, this is cozy.
Yes.
Elinor?
Yes, Jimmy?
Promise me you'll be careful out there.
Those western horses are very dangerous.
I promise.
Your eyes are extraordinarily blue tonight.
Harris Tire here, valve-and-bearing heiress.
It ought to fit.
Maybe if we’d been plain Mr. And Mrs. Harris...
...worrying about butcher's bills and...
If Harold could see us now. He made me promise not to see you until after the...
- You know what I mean.
- Puss in Boots?
What is he anyway?
Your lawyer or a suitor?
Now, let's not quarrel about that again, please.
By the way...
...who'd you say you gave my...?
Gave Ferdinand to?
Oh, some girl.
I must mean an awful lot to you.
- Who started this Reno business anyway?
- Who supplied me with the grounds?
Add insanity to the list.
I was nuts to come up here.
- Where's my hat?
- Where it usually is, on the floor.
Goodbye. Have a nice six weeks with Puss in Boots.
He doesn’t mean a thing.
Don't call him that.
This is the happiest moment of my life.
Thanks for the hospitality.
But, Mr. Faber, they got such beautiful notices...
...such talent, such, how you say, snap.
Everywhere, my girls are the sensation.
I think you make big mistake.
Well, goodbye, Mr. Faber.
I'm back.
So you decided finally to come home again.
That's very nice of you.
That's very lovely of you.
Now, madam, hitchhiking from Akron in three days is pretty good.
I had to walk all the way from the Bronx.
I make you in charge of the troupe, and what happens?
First one comes back, then a couple more.
A flea circus I run?
Isn't everyone back?
- Now all but Bubbles.
- But Sally was with her.
Bubbles' boyfriend put her in a train at Ashtabula.
Now, who knows when Bubbles will be back?
Without her, we might as well try to sell apples.
"Where's the hot one?" They ask.
What a life for an artist.
You, I could maybe teach.
But, no, a flesh peddler I must be.
A jellyfish salesman.
Don't worry, madam.
Someday, you'll be famous again.
And I'll be your discovery.
I got an idea for a dance in Akron.
All the way across Ohio,
I've been working on it in my mind.
I never knew whether I was driving in a truck or a swell private car.
I could hear the music, and my feet kept making up the steps.
It's called "Morning Star."
You know, the last star before sunrise?
Watch me, madam.
Stop, stop, stop.
Where can I sell a "Morning Star"?
They want Bubbles I tell you.
Over in Hoboken, there is a chance for a hula.
Good pay. Bubbles could do the solo.
But where is she?
I could do it for you.
- You know I'm good at learning new steps.
- A hula is not dancing.
It's nothing but oomph, and you haven't got it.
I could learn it.
You don’t learn oomph.
You are born with it.
Well, it's got to be done, and we'll do it, if we have to break every bone in my body.
Very nice.
Neat, in fact. Classy.
What a great showman you are,
Mr. Kajoolian.
Very classy.
Too classy, in fact.
Look, I run a dance and drink place, not a kindergarten.
But, Mr. Kajoolian, you do not understand.
She could do it different.
She could do it how you want.
What my customers go for, she ain't got.
Wait a minute, Mr. Hoboken.
- Bubbles.
- Hello, madam.
Mr. Kajoolian, now we got what your customers go for.
I ain't got an ounce of class, sugar. Honest.
Can you dance?
Well, it's been called that.
- Hi, kid.
- Hello, Bubbles.
Bubbles.
The landlady told me ma'am was having a hula audition, so here I am.
Can she really dance?
Sit down, Mr. Kajoolian.
Please don’t mind.
Okay. She's got what I want.
You see what I mean?
Twenty-five a week. Tonight.
Come the way you are.
- Well, thanks, but what about the rest?
- Yes, for background.
Oh, she don’t need no background.
I'll be seeing you, honey.
But, Mr. Kajoolian, girls would be such a wonderful background.
- Couldn't use them.
- I'm sorry. I was hoping he's take all of us.
Congratulations, Bubbles.
I'm glad one of us got a job.
- Imagine that, 25 a week.
- Gee, you're lucky.
Yeah, if you fell in a gutter, you’d come up with a diamond necklace.
Listen, squirt, I don’t fall in gutters.
I pick my spots.
- Nice fur. From Sam?
- Yeah. It's fox.
But there's a little skunk in Sam or I wouldn't be here.
Well, if it isn't my old friend Ferdinand.
Don't let it get you down, Judy.
Come on, let's get dressed.
You run along, Sally. I'll be down later.
All right.
If you won't tell me where we're going, why did I have to bring my ballet costume?
- You may have to dance, my dear.
- But what about the other girls?
Aren't you the best, now that Bubbles has gone?
We have arrived.
You look very, very smart in your new hat today.
We are but a few short steps from destiny, Judy.
There is where our fortune lies.
Never shall it be said...
...that the great Basilova did not make the last sacrifice for art.
We are not too proud to beg favors.
Wait. Wait!
Get me an ambulance.
- Is she dead?
- Who is she?
All right, folks, stand back.
Give her air. Come on.
Get away from there. Don't touch her.
Stand back.
- Please let me through.
- Relative of yours, lady?
Madam.
I'll be all right, Judy.
- I'll be all right.
- Sure you will.
Don't forget...
...Mr. Adams.
It's a great chance.
- A great...
- Don't talk.
Judy...
...don’t forget...
...Adams.
Steve Adams.
Dance...
...dance...
...dance.
Hold it. Hold it.
Very nice, Vivian.
All right, take a rest.
- It still needs plenty of work.
- I know.
Some of the figures are slurred.
Poses aren't quite definite.
- It needs more precision.
- Of course.
Will you type those notes, Olmy?
I'll buzz you when I'm ready.
Frankly, Fitch, I'm afraid your classical influence has been a little strong.
- Yes?
- Honey, there's a Miss O'Brien here...
...from a Madam Basil...
Basil something.
But she claims she has an appointment, or Madam Basil did, last Thursday.
Only she was killed on the way or something.
Okay, darling.
Miss Olmstead will see you.
Right through that door.
What a dreadful experience, Miss O'Brien.
You see, Madam Basilova was our teacher and manager.
She was bringing me here to try and place us.
- Us?
- Oh, I meant to say we're a troupe.
There are eight of us.
Well, that is, there used to be...
...but one of the girls got a job in a nightclub in Hoboken.
Miss O'Brien,
I don’t think you quite understand.
I mean, I think you've come to the wrong place.
You see, Mr. Adams is...
Well, he's only interested in the very exceptional...
You've never seen us dance.
You can't tell from just talking.
They work so hard, and they've has such rotten luck.
You've got to give us a chance.
- Well... Well, I'll see...
- Yeah, I know. All right, all right.
- Oh, Mr. Fitch, this young lady...
- Have a seat, young lady.
I'll try to see you after.
Places.
Sit down, and if I get a chance,
I'll ask Mr. Adams to see you.
And your interpretation of a bluebird...
...was lovely.
But who do you think cares?
Have you never heard of telephones, factories, cafeterias?
That'll never do. You write it, Olmy.
Your rejections are always so tactful.
Looks like it's gonna rain.
Sometimes I think if I ever see another bird dancing, I'll shoot it.
Hey, I'm talking to you.
"What we're interested in,
Miss Hemingway...
...is not an interpretation of birdlife, however lovely...
...but an interpretation of American life today.
Shopkeepers, mechanics, aviators..."
Why is it, Olmy, that you're the only woman who can ever understand me?
Now, that letter to Mexico City...
Okay, okay.
You still need lots of work though.
Take a rest. I'll be back in five minutes.
Well, young lady, what can I do for you?
Nothing, I...
I guess I made a mistake.
Oh, there's a girl waiting in my office.
She's awfully anxious to see you.
I told her you would.
- She must have been awfully anxious.
- Well, isn't that funny? Your umbrella.
Tell Fitch I'll be down at the music hall.
Going down.
Hey, Steve.
I was just going up to see you.
You know that niece of mine?
I never saw a 6-year-old who could tap like she can.
Bring her around when she's 16, Arthur.
I hope we get a taxi.
Yeah, so do I.
Taxi.
Taxi.
Can I help?
Have you got a fishing rod?
You're the same girl.
I beg your pardon?
Well, I can see it wasn't mutual, but...
Did you lose something valuable?
Yes, a dime.
Oh, you've missed your bus.
That's too bad.
There'll be another along presently.
You're very kind, but I like the rain.
That's no way to treat a Good Samaritan.
Mind if I share my own umbrella?
Thank you very much. Goodbye.
That was your last dime, wasn't it?
You know, it's dangerous to turn up your nose on a day like this.
You might drown.
- When I first saw you in the elevator...
- So you followed me.
No, I didn’t. But I wanted to.
I wanted to speak to you.
Oh, not just because you happen to be beautiful...
...but you looked unhappy, as if you were worried about something.
It was... Well, the sort of day when a fellow needs a friend.
You figured me out during that ride in the elevator?
Oh, when it reached the ground floor,
I felt as if I knew you very well.
Look here...
...there's something awfully nice about a taxi on a rainy say.
Now, please, I like the rain, and I like walking alone.
Come on. Eat this while it's hot.
It's good soup stock, and there's an onion in it.
Where on earth did you get an onion?
I borrowed it from Mrs. Simpson.
Oh, go on.
Eat that before it's too cold.
And the next time a fellow offers you his umbrella in a rainstorm, take it.
Oh, go on, eat.
You know a dancer needs plenty of vitamins.
Don't talk to me about dancing again.
I'm through.
At that place today...
...I saw what real dancing is.
I did covered I just don’t know anything.
- Sally, what's the use of pretending?
- Oh, I know, Judy.
I wish I could help.
I feel like an awful dumbbell just hanging around.
Wait.
Bubbles. Miss Bubbles.
Yeah, it's me.
Only it's Lily now, Lily White.
I always did think you were the smartest of the lot, Miss Bu... Miss White.
Thank you.
That suite of mine is vacant with half a private bath.
Thanks, but my new position demands a better address.
I'm living on the drive.
I like the view of the park, and Rollo just loves the trees.
Are the girls in?
Some of the girls left without paying rent.
Miss Judy and Sally owe me back rent...
...not counting the butter, eggs and sugar they've borrowed.
How much are they in hock for?
Eighteen dollars.
Here's the money, but don’t tell them I paid you.
I won't.
Hey.
- Bubbles.
- How's Pavlova and the dying swan?
Gosh.
I mean, Hoboken must be treating you pretty well.
That joint? Listen, baby,
I've been discovered.
On my third night, by a great big capitalist, a Mr. Humplewinger.
He's in the artificial-limb business...
...and owns half-interest in the Bailey Brothers' show.
No more hula for me, kids.
I've been promoted.
- To a burlesque queen?
- Yeah.
They're gonna feature me.
Say, getting down to brass tacks, Judy.
How'd you like a job doing your solo?
- You know, "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"?
- Oh, Judy.
But the Bailey Brothers is burlesque.
Well, what's wrong with that?
Say, you might be discovered yourself, like I was.
But would they want my kind of dancing?
Listen, me and Dwarfie...
That's what I call Mr. Humplewinger.
- We put it over.
"What we need is a tony number," we said.
To go on right before my act.
You know, to sort of lead up to it.
"Do you know anybody?" They said.
Well, right away, I said,
"Sure, my girlfriend Judy O'Brien."
"If you pay her enough money," I said.
I laughed at them when they said 20.
"Not a cent under 25," I said.
- Twenty-five?
- Yeah.
Oh, Bubbles, you're an angel.
Save the mascara.
Step right in, the box office is open.
The Bailey Brothers' big extravaganza.
Thirty-six little ladies whose only wish is to entertain you.
Step right in. The show is going on now.
We are proud and fortunate to present to you...
...in her daring novel specialty,
Manhattan's Tiger Lily White.
- Give them all you got, baby.
- They couldn't take it.
I am not a goody-goody
Just a baby in the woody
Love has got me worried and perplexed
Oh, yeah?
Gosh, oh, gee, I want my mama
Goodness me, I need my mama
Maybe she could tell me
What comes next
I'll tell you.
My mother told me
There'd be days like this
When I wouldn't know what to do
She told me what not to do
She said some boy
Would take me in his arms
And tell me, oh, what lies
But did mother realize
The boy would be you?
- Or you.
- She meant me.
- No, not you.
- Oh, me.
- Or you.
- It's a date, honey.
Or you. What boat you off, buddy?
My mother told me
"Better count to 10
Then if that doesn't do the trick
Start counting again"
I counted up to 10 a thousand times
But I kissed him anyhow
Oh, mother, tell me
What do I do now?
My mother told me
There'd be days like this
When the wind would begin to blow
And I wouldn't know where to go
She said the night
Would be so cold and dark
And I'd be all alone
And every dream I owned
Would blow away
My mother told me
"Baby, you keep warm
Keep your little self bundled up
When you're caught in a storm"
She told me just exactly what to do
But didn't tell me how
Oh, mother, mother
Hey, Mom, what do I do now?
Hey, what is this?
Go home, little girl.
Your mother wants you.
- Go home, little girl. Go home.
- What is this?
Yeah, beat it. We want Lily.
Yeah, we want Lily.
Yeah, we want Lily.
We want Lily back.
Yeah, bring back Lily.
Take it from the 2-4 again.
We want Lily. We want Lily.
We want Lily.
We want Lily. We want Lily.
We want Lily. We want Lily.
We want Lily. We want Lily.
We want Lily. We want Lily.
We want Lily.
We want Lily. We want Lily.
We want Lily.
We want Lily. We want Lily.
We want Lily.
We want Lily. We want Lily.
We want Lily.
That was a riot.
- That's the way you gonna do this.
- Sensational.
That's all she's gotta do, the same thing every show.
That's all you gotta do.
Listen to them yelling.
- You'll get used to it, kid.
- We want Lily. We want Lily.
We want Lily.
I am just a sweet young thing of 22
Or so.
I never think to smoke or drink
My life is one long...
What?
No.
I finished at Miss Sniffing's school
A model debutante
I know each fork and spoon and rule
I don't say "can't" but "can't"
My etiquette is ooh, mais oui
I pour a proper pot of tea
And even when I need a nip
I never, never, never slip
Well, almost never.
Oh, cut it out, fellows.
Try to be a lady
Morning, noon and night
But when I hear music
Get the jitterbug bite
Over tea and crumpets
Gee, but I'm polite
But when I hear trumpets
Get the jitterbug bite
I'm quite the quiet type
Poise in every move
But boy do I get noisy
When the boys get in the groove, yeah
How can I be highbrow?
What an awful plight
Gotta say goodbye now
You'll pardon me, I gotta blow
I got a slight twitch in my toe
My feet are just itching to go
Got the jitterbug bite, ouch
Got a jitterbug bite, yeah, yeah
Got a jitterbug bite
Why didn’t you tell me you wanted a stooge?
It's 25 bucks a week. That's twice what you could make anywhere else.
And twice as nice work, I suppose.
Listen. There's about 4000 girls in this town...
...who can fill that spot just as good as you can.
- I got you because I felt sorry for you.
- Thanks.
What is it?
What a gag. What a gag.
The best gag on Broadway.
Not bad, Miss O'Brien.
Don't you think so, Larry?
- It was great.
- Well, I don’t know.
Toe dancer, maybe for a few weeks.
Might be okay, Harry.
For 25 bucks a week, we can take a chance.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
You're wasting your time.
We gotta find another girl. She's quitting.
Who says I'm quitting?
See the country's favorite, Tiger Lily.
Just a few seats left.
Go home, little girl, your mother wants you.
Something rather depraved about you, Steve.
Hiding a yen for burlesque under cover of the ballet.
Chasing after Tiger Lilies.
It's not the Tiger Lily we're after.
We're going to see her little stooge.
Her footwork isn't bad at all.
Her eyes aren't either.
We want Lily.
This is it, buddy.
Tiger Lily's just what you need.
How do you know what I need?
How would you like to be accused of mental cruelty at 9:00 this morning?
She's probably drinking mint juleps...
...or whatever they drink in Reno, with a cowboy or a lawyer.
In there, if you got something to forget, you can forget it.
If you got something to remember, you can remember it.
- I can't change a 20.
- Keep it.
Thanks.
- You better let me have a dollar.
- Sure.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Hey.
Better make it two.
- Thanks.
- Okay.
Oh, give us a break.
- We want Lily.
- We want Lily.
I wouldn't do that.
Give the little lady a break.
Send her back.
Come on, now, cut it out.
She's trying to entertain you.
- We want Lily.
- We want Lily.
Say, what's the matter with you guys?
You're mixing her up.
It must be part of the act.
Keep still and let her dance.
I didn’t come here to see no fairy tale.
- Then go someplace else.
- Oh, yeah?
- Okay.
- We want Lily.
It's okay, I know him.
Get out of there.
Don't let them rattle you.
You keep right on with your dance.
They've got no right to heckle you.
Don't let them get you down.
You keep right on.
That's the ticket.
Show them you can take it.
Hey, cut that out.
Throwing things at a girl.
You keep right on there.
Come back here, little girl.
Don't let them scare you.
Come back and finish your dance.
Bring Lily back.
Hello, Akron. Dressing Room 4, honey.
I'll be off in a minute.
Hey, you should have used the stage entrance.
- It's Dressing Room 4.
- Must be a well-beaten trail...
...but it's twinkle-toes I'm after.
- Same trail, mister.
Come in.
Say, you were going on fine.
What's the matter with that gang out there?
You shouldn’t have done that.
- They're supposed to laugh at me.
- Oh, I don’t see why.
- I thought your dance was very pretty.
- I didn’t think you'd remember me.
- Yeah, we do know each other, don’t we?
- Do we?
Sure, it was at the Winter Garden, wasn't it?
No, it wasn't the Winter Garden.
Well, it was someplace.
It was Akron, Ohio.
Don't tell me we went to school together?
Where did you get this?
Think hard.
Palais Royale.
Don't you remember?
The police closed it up, and you kept it open.
- You said you were celebrating something.
- Celebrating?
Of course, how rude of me.
I took you out.
- But didn’t I leave you flat?
- No, no, that was Lily.
You gave her this little bull.
You're the girl with the blue eyes.
But you said you didn’t like me because I had blue eyes.
That's a thing of the past.
Say, did you get me in a jam.
I tried to pass you off as Judy's boyfriend.
Dwarfie said,
"You're gonna sneak out with him."
So I said we're all going out together on a foursome.
We can start out with them, like you're for Judy.
I's like to meet Dwarfie, but perhaps the young lady in question...
Judy? Well, she totes that bull around everywhere she goes.
I guess she won't mind.
- Come on. Give an encore.
- Tearing the house down.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Okay, okay. One Tiger Lily coming up.
- Shake it up.
And remember, no walking out on me tonight.
Hurry up. We sneak out before Tiger Lily floats back.
But she expects you.
Oh, you wouldn't wanna break
Dwarfie's heart. Come on.
We'll have that date I thought we had.
All right, but I'll take Ferdinand.
Sure, but hurry up. I'll meet you outside.
- You were very amusing.
- Thanks.
Miss O'Brien?
Miss O'Brien has gone.
Would you mind giving her my card?
Thanks.
Ask her to get in touch with me.
- Friend of yours?
- No.
- Night, Dad. Thanks.
- Good night, Dad.
- Well, next time. Yeah.
- Next time.
- Well, there goes our date.
- Never mind.
I know a nice lunch wagon halfway home, and you helped me once.
You'll never regret this investment,
Miss O'Brien.
I never saw New York on foot before.
It's exciting.
Or is it you?
I could go on forever.
Everything's so shiny.
Even the garbage cans.
Say, isn't it about time you were buying me another meal?
I'm afraid you'll have to go hungry.
Here we are.
What, already?
- It was a lovely evening.
- It was.
- Well, good night.
- Good night.
Good morning.
Well, good night.
Good night.
Keep away from guys like me, Judy.
We're rotten.
We make nice people like you unhappy.
We're unhappy ourselves.
Everything we touch goes wrong.
It's bad for you to see me again.
You're too sweet, too real.
And I've got just enough decency to keep away from you.
Goodbye.
I'll see you tonight, darling.
Irish, we met at just the right moment.
Tonight, we'll celebrate.
I'll give you the history of Jimmy Harris and Ferdinand.
And if you're very good,
I'll give you Jimmy Harris.
Good night. Good morning.
See you in about 16 hours.
Star bright, star light
The last star I see tonight
I wish I may, I wish I might
Have the wish I wish tonight
Please make me a dancer too.
Oh, no.
I'm sorry, sir.
I must have fell asleep, sir.
She's in there. I couldn't stop her, sir.
She came in just after you went out last night, sir.
Elinor.
Oh, it's morning.
I must have fallen asleep.
What are you doing here?
I flew.
What are you doing coming home at this hour?
I can't see it's any of your business.
You're right, it isn't.
Not anymore.
Your freedom, Mr. Harris. The final decree.
I has it tied in blue, your favorite color.
It may not be a very gallant thing to say,
Elinor, but I'm very happy.
Are you? Really?
Yes.
Well, in that case,
I might as well be running along.
Aren't you going to offer me some breakfast?
I'm sorry. What'll it be?
- What have you been drinking?
- Nothing.
My...
...she must be a lot more interesting than me.
Reno seems to have agreed with you,
Elinor. You look fine.
Thank you.
Oh, don’t let's have a drink.
Such finality about it.
Well, there's no reason why we can't see each other...
...occasionally.
Some of the past wasn't do bad, was it?
- Some of it was wonderful.
- Paris?
Havana, and that little balcony in Rome.
The Club Ferdinand.
That girl, you didn’t take her there, did you?
Of course not.
- And don’t you go there with Puss in Boots.
- Oh, of course not.
By the way...
...we're getting married tomorrow, or rather today.
That's what I came to tell you.
- Elinor, you can't. You mustn't.
- Why?
Because he's a fool and a nincompoop.
You're another to think you could be happy.
- You're jealous.
- I'm not jealous.
- How could I be jealous of a puss in boots?
- Oh, don’t call him that.
Marry him, Elinor. I hope you'll be happy.
I know I will.
I was a fool to come here in the first place.
We're sailing for Bermuda tomorrow, and I wanted to say goodbye decently.
But you haven't changed. You never will.
You're a weak, silly adolescent...
...and I hope I never see you again in my life.
Bon voyage, madam.
My pajamas, Clause.
I have to get a good say's sleep.
Morning star, morning star
Don't you know the night has ended?
You and I flew too high
Now it's time that we descended
- Good evening, Mr. Harris.
- How do you do?
The other stars have fled
You're on your own now
- My dream of love is dead
- Champagne, Mr. Harris?
Champagne cocktails for Mr. Harris.
I'm all alone now
- Morning star, here we are
- We are.
This new dawn is far from bright
So, morning star, good night
Did you see Ferdinand's father?
- All right, mister, I want a nice one.
- Nice big smile.
Thank you.
Hello, Jim.
Everybody seems to know you.
Yes, well, that's part of what I have to tell you.
I'm dying of curiosity.
Well, I used to come here occasionally, before...
Before I met you in Akron.
- Oh, hello, Jim.
- Oh, hello.
- How are you?
- I'm fine. Glad to see you.
- Big doings, huh?
- Yes, big doings.
Oh, hello there.
Did you see what I saw?
- Is my petticoat showing or something?
- No, I guess it's mine.
Your cocktails, Mr. Harris.
- To the end of something.
- The end?
And the beginning of something better, Irish.
Sometimes I wish your eyes were brown.
What is it you have to tell me, Jimmy?
Well, here goes.
To begin with, I'm disgustingly rich.
I was born that way.
Go on.
I uses to come here a lot.
You said that before.
Yes, but I used to come here with someone.
I never thought I's bring anyone else here.
It seemed to stand for something.
Something phony, I guess.
I'm cured now. I must be, because here I am back at the old Ferdinand.
You're with me, and I'm having the time of my life.
You promised you would never come here again.
Well, you promised too.
You've never been able to keep your word.
- Don't talk like that to my wife.
- Keep out of this.
- I was his wife before I was yours.
- Please, Elinor, let's not have a scene.
Why not?
Jimmy, you can't do that. Excuse me.
- Get this...
- I got it.
Atta boy.
- Pardon me, just a minute.
- Come, let's...
- Let's go someplace where it's quiet.
- Yes, and safe.
I want to go, please.
- Waiter.
- Yes, Mr. Harris?
- Check, please.
- Right away.
Thank you.
- Meet you at Ciro's.
- That's fine, all right.
- I'm not coming.
- What?
But, darling, they're expecting us.
We're married.
Get it annulled. You're a smart lawyer.
Taxi.
- Good night, Jimmy.
- Judy, please, let me explain. L...
You're still in love with her.
I knew as soon as I saw her blue eyes.
Thanks, folks. Now, stand a little closer.
Judy.
- Keep the change.
- Well, if it isn't the Tiger Lily.
Miss, have you seen the papers?
Who'd ever think our Judy...?
Where is she?
Locked herself in her room.
She refuses to see no one.
- Get her to come out.
- Take your picture with her.
I don’t need her to get me in the papers.
Let me in, it's Bubbles.
I don’t feel like talking with anyone, Bubbles.
You're afraid to face me.
You never told me he had money.
After all I've done for you.
If it wasn't for me, you'd be starving in the gutters where I found you.
Please, Bubbles,
I'll see you later at the theater.
Judy.
Judy.
Your rich fellow's here.
That Mr. Harris, in a taxi.
He says he won't go away until he sees you.
I don’t want to see anybody,
Mrs. Simpson.
He's sitting on the running board.
He won't move.
Says he's on a sit-down strike.
Judy, are you listening?
Judy.
Judy, honey, I'm sorry I lost my temper.
I know how you feel.
I'll go right down and get rid of him for you, Judy, honey.
- How are you, Jimmy?
- You sure pinned on a pip.
- How long have you known the lady?
- Look this way a moment.
Leave me alone.
I got squatters' rights on this step, and I'm entitled to a little privacy.
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please.
There, there, lambie.
Oh, can't you see he's tired?
Lily's tired baby.
There now, sweetie, chin up.
Light all right?
Smile, duckie.
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks.
I won't forget that, kid.
Just call it
"Playboy finds consolation in Tiger Lily."
Okay, Tiger.
- Now what, Olmy?
- You could have knocked me over...
...such sweet, innocent look that girl has.
Just look at that.
You remember that girl I told you wanted to see you?
- This girl came to see me?
- Yes.
- Why didn’t you tell me?
- I did.
She was waiting for you, only she didn’t wait.
The day it rained.
Oh, that's why we didn’t hear from her.
The funny part is we took this fellow,
Harris, to be part of her act.
Yeah, I guess he is too.
After all, she's a Gaiety Girl.
That's right. Condemn a girl because she has to earn her own living.
Why, she belongs in that place just about as much as I do.
Fitch, go and tell Helen she'll break her back if she doesn’t relax more.
Got a heavy date tonight, Olmy?
- Well, l...
- You will come with me, won't you, Olmy?
I always wanted to see a burlesque show.
Lily come in yet?
Heard from her?
- Well?
- Same thing.
Ain't been home since morning.
I can't reach Humplewinger either.
We're gonna have to put Gracie on.
If you put a substitute on, they'll tear the house down.
They always tear it down anyhow.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Where the devil you been?
- Yeah, where have you been?
- Why wasn't you at the matinee?
- You've got about three minutes.
Scram, and let a lady dress.
Go on, get out.
Why...
Anything wrong?
Not a thing, sweetie pie.
This is my last performance.
I said this is my last performance.
I'm sorry.
Did you get a better offer?
Yes.
I accepted it too.
I got married this afternoon.
I hope you'll be very happy.
Where have you been?
I've been looking for you.
- What do you mean by busting in here?
- Hey, wait a minute. I got something...
Come on, get going.
You mean it wasn't Dwarfie?
That sucker? Why, no, darling,
I married a friend of yours.
A Mr. James Harris, Jr.
For the love of heaven, Lily.
Okay, okay, one Tiger Lily coming up.
- Step on it, Judy.
- Hey, ma, what do I do now?
Come on, Judy.
We didn’t pay to see a tree.
What's the matter back there?
Give us some action!
- Hurry up.
- You are fired. You...
- Get on.
- What's the matter, can't you take it?
- How could you do it to him?
- Go on, get out there.
Trying to steal Tiger Lily's stuff, little girl?
- Bring Lily back.
- We want Lily.
We want Lily back.
Don't mind us, we can take it.
Oh, she's going home to mama.
What are you gonna do now, cry?
Go ahead and stare. I'm not ashamed.
Go on, laugh, get your money's worth.
Nobody’s going to hurt you.
I know you want me to tear my clothes off do you can look your 50 cents' worth.
Fifty cents for the privilege of staring at a girl the way your wives won't let you.
What do you suppose we think of you up here?
With your silly smirks your mothers would be ashamed of.
It's a thing of the moment for the dress suits to come and laugh at us too.
We’d laugh right back at you, only we're paid to let you sit there...
...and roll your eyes, and make your screamingly clever remarks.
What's it for?
So you can go home when the show's over, strut before your wives and sweethearts...
...and play at being the stronger sex for a minute?
I'm sure they see through you just like we do.
- Go on back.
- You're a sensation.
- They want you.
- Take another bow.
Come here.
Crabbing my act, you jealous little pig.
Come on. Get her quick. Break it up.
Break it up.
- Come on, girls. Break it up.
- Stop it.
Hello.
What are you giving me, brother?
I'm not married, I'm divorced.
But at 4:00 this afternoon, in Richmond, Virginia...
...you and the well-known
Tiger Lily White...
You mean I married her?
I don’t care if she's in a night court or a circus. She can take care of herself.
Look, Mr. Harris, she had a fight with your other girl...
...her dancing partner, Judy O'Brien.
Judy?
Mr. Harris' marriage had nothing to do with me.
They're in night court.
You wanna make a statement?
I'm not interested. I don’t care who's where, and I'm not making any statements.
Where in the blazes is the night court?
Judge, look at my eye, look at my leg.
Look where she slapped me on the back.
I must remind the complainant, as well as the spectators...
...that this is a night court, not a burlesque.
The complaint stated that you slapped her.
Oh, no, Your Honor. I punched her, and then
I jumped on her and tried to strangle her.
You mean you happened to catch your arms around your opponent's neck...
...in an act of self-defense?
Oh, no, Your Honor. I wanted to kill her.
Miss O'Brien, will you please sit up here?
I must warn you again, Miss O'Brien...
...that whatever you say may be used as evidence against you.
You want me to tell the truth, don’t you?
Yes, of course.
Well, let us proceed.
Now, about this temper of yours.
You are Irish, aren't you?
Well, I have a habit of simmering,
Your Honor.
But I usually keep myself from boiling over.
Miss O'Brien, you seem to be positively enjoying yourself.
Have you ever got a load off your mind?
Everything at once, after you've gone around for weeks holding it in?
You are the one on trial,
Miss O'Brien, not I.
She's jealous because I'm the whole show.
She thinks she's a wonderful dancer, but she's a stooge.
I won't warn you again, miss. Quiet.
Go on, Miss O'Brien.
I can't say being a stooge is fun,
Your Honor.
But it was just like practice to me.
It isn't that I think I'm a great dancer.
I know I'm not...
...but dancing means everything to me.
I've never cared about anything else.
She's lying, judge.
She tried to steal my boyfriend, and she got sore because he married me.
I must ask the complainant to wait her turn.
Just a minute, Your Honor.
I think I can explain.
- And who are you?
- He's my husband.
James Harris, Jr.
He'll tell you, judge.
Let the young man come in.
Everything's my fault.
I feel responsible for all this.
He has nothing to do with this.
He thinks he did, and I thought he did...
Miss O'Brien, are you sure that jealousy has nothing to do with your behavior?
After all, the complainant is the wife of an admitted friend of yours.
You see, all of us have been kind of mixed up about each other.
Lots of times I've been mad at Bubbles, but I shouldn’t have been.
She's just like a kid who can't stand it if another kid has one marble...
...even if she has 20.
And Mr. Harris, he was wrong in his feelings for me.
He was running away from something...
...when the best thing he could've done was run after it and face it...
...and struggle with it for the rest of his life if he has to.
He was running away from a part of himself.
You can't separate a man from what really belongs to him.
I found that out...
...and I'm afraid Bubbles will find it out too.
Naturally, it was a little bit hard for me to face tonight...
...but I discovered my mistake...
...but I hasn't quite got around to facing things again and...
Well, I'm sorry, but I lost my head.
That's all, Your Honor.
There are times when it seems hard to punish human nature for just being human.
However...
...are you ready for the sentence,
Miss O'Brien?
Yes, Your Honor.
I know in spirit you will both bear
Miss O'Brien's punishment with her...
...knowing yourselves equally to blame.
Miss O'Brien...
...in view of your own admission,
I find you guilty of disorderly conduct.
Ten days or $50.
- I'll pay the fine.
- I'll take the 10 days.
Please. Where do I pay?
- I won't accept it.
- You've got to.
Mr. Harris, the young lady seems to mean it.
Judy?
It's all right, Bubbles.
You’d better put some raw meat on your eye.
Abraham Lincoln Johnson,
Martha Washington Johnson.
Abraham Lincoln Johnson,
Martha Washington Johnson.
It looks like our marriage was a mistake.
Well, you may be right, but desertion’s rather expensive.
Oh, I have an excellent lawyer for annulments.
With two in the family, he might even make us a wholesale price.
Put your arms around both of them.
In a little closer, Mrs. Harris.
And you, too, Mrs. Harris.
Just call it
"Tiger Lily throws playboy back to mate...
...for $50,000."
- Third door on your left.
- Thank you.
Miss O'Brien, go right in.
Oh, come in, my dear.
He's expecting you.
It's all right. Go on in.
You're not Mr. Adams...
...not really, are you?
Yes, I'm awfully sorry.
I'd have bailed you out last night...
...but the judge and I decided you weren't in a mood to accept favors.
- I'm still in no mood.
- Now, listen to me, you silly child.
I've encountered your temperament before.
There are times when it's distinctly out of place, not to say downright idiotic.
You've has your own way long enough.
From now on, you're gonna listen to me.
- Pardon me.
- I couldn't stop him.
Fitch, in this corner, we have
Battling Judy O'Brien, my latest discovery.
She was born with more than any dancer we've got, and she knows less.
- It's our job to teach her what we know.
- Glad to have met you, Miss O'Brien.
I hear you pack a mighty fine wallop.
Excuse me, but when I think of everything...
...of how simple things could have been, I...
I've just got to laugh.
Go ahead and laugh, Judy O'Brien.

And here, folks, are some of the most famous homes, shops...
...and hotels in New Yolk City.
Fifth Avenue, the street where the original 400 built their homes...
...making it the most celebrated...
...richest avenue in the world.
See it for yourself.
The famous homes of New York's Fifth Avenue.
That magnificent marble dwelling that we are now approaching...
...is the Guggenhoff Mansion.
He was the copper king.
And there on your light...
...that big brownstone mansion that's all boarded up...
...that is the townhouse oi the great industrial wizard...
...Michael J. O'Connor.
The second-richest man in the world.
Leaders of society. business and politics built their homes upon this avenue.
Palatial homes worth millions.
See for yourself the famous homes of New York's Fifth Avenue.
The wealthiest and most fashionable avenue in the world's largest city.
To your left is the internationally known
Museum of Science and History.
Look ahead and you will see at 90th street
Andrew Carnegie's fabulous residence.
Well. Sammy. everything looks just the same as usual.
It's certainly nice to be back again. ain't it?
Come on. Let's go up and clean up a bit.
- Well. is everything out?
- Yup.
Everything but the tenant in 4G.
He refuses to be evicted.
Refuses?
Did you tell him the place is being tom down... putting up an 80-story building?
Yep. I told him.
He said if an 80-story building goes up, he's going up with it.
The manager's up arguing with the guy now.
But, Mr. Bullock, you had ample notice.
Please put on your pants and vacate at once.
I've got lights.
Constitutional lights. and that's what I'm standing-- Sitting on.
Besides Section 40,
Article 27 of the Housing Code...
...no discharged veteran can be evicted.
There's no such regulation.
- There isn't?
- No.
Well. there should be.
I refuse to be evicted, because a wealthy
Croesus named Michael O'Connor...
...wishes to perpetuate his name with an 80-story steel monument.
MI. Bullock. I'm terribly sorry--
Oh-ho. So it's you again.
Well, if you came back to apologize, you can.
MI. Bullock. don't you realize this building is being tom down?
Every tenant has vacated but you.
Listen, churn,
I've hunted three months for this foxhole...
...and I'm not leaving this bed.
Will you vacate quietly. or must I--?
Call your Cossacks.
I'll fight it out on this front if it takes all winter.
All right, boys.
Take him out.
- Come on.
- There you are.
Do your worst.
I captured these handcuffs from a Japanese MP.
Little did I know that this souvenir of war...
...would become the instrument of resisting tyranny.
Go ahead. Let's see you move me now.
Ha!
I'll fight this outrageous intrusion of human rights.
I'll sue Michael O'Connor.
He can't get away with this.
Because I'm in bed is no sign I'm taking this.
Michael O'Connor is an octopus.
A human. ah-ah. octopus slowly strangling civilization in his tentacles.
Sam. stop that.
Go on up here.
Come on. Up.
Is that your dog?
Yes. I'm terribly sorry.
I suppose my dog and I are somewhat responsible.
Why don't you keep him on a leash?
Well, he's not afraid I'll run away.
Ale you. Sam?
Say. you better go home and change.
- Where do you live?
- Right here.
You're practically standing in the middle of my living room.
Draw up a chair and sit down.
Uh-uh.
Careful of those cigar ashes on the rug.
Oh. terrible thing. isn't it?
The housing problem.
I'd settle for an upholstered steam-heated gutter.
Well, fortunately,
I solved my residential problem years ago.
Say. he likes you.
And when Sam likes a stranger, that's good enough for me.
I feel somewhat obligated.
Care to be my guest for the night?
No, I don't wanna trouble you.
Thanks, anyway.
Oh, it's no trouble at all.
As it happens. I live alone.
I'd be delighted to have you.
Well. are you sure it would be all light with Sam?
Do you...? Do you always...?
Only when the house is boarded up.
Only when the house is boarded up.
Yeah. Come on.
“Michael O'Connor. winner Champion...
...Class B Sloop. 1937 Newport Races.“
Michael O'Connor.
Here you are. my boy. Try this.
Well. isn't this just dandy?
The great Michael O'Connor in person.
I've always wanted to see a walking cash register. Listen. moneybags.
While guys like you are living here in Oriental splendor...
...guys like me are being thrown out of $40-a-month apartments.
You so wrapped up in races you forgot there's a human race?
My boy, much to my regret, you've forced me to divulge a secret. lam not MI. O'Connor.
My name is McKeever.
Aloysius T. McKeever.
You mean. you're not...?
Yeah. but isn't this...?
I mean. don't you--?
Well, let us say that I'm a guest of Mr. O'Connor.
Oh. I'm sorry. I thought maybe...
- You mean you live here all alone?
- Uh-huh.
Where's O'Connor?
In Virginia.
A place called Bubbling Springs.
Oh, it's quite beautiful there.
“Evicted tenant calls O'Connor octopus.“
Heh. What do you think of that?
Couldn't you have kept this thing out of the newspapers?
Publicity like this doesn't do me or the project any good.
I was on my way down here.
Picked up the paper at the airport.
Octopus. Heh.
Well, let's get on.
Gentlemen. you're wondering why I called this conference.
The building we're constructing in New Yolk. as you're well aware of...
...is merely the first link in our postwar plans.
Our new headquarters. in 'fact.
Link number two is light there.
Take a good look. gentlemen.
This is the main terminal of our newest and greatest venture.
An ail cargo network that will span the globe.
And with the proper facilities, as you see here...
...vast quantities of industrial cargo can be moved by air...
...a dozen times as rapidly as present land and water transportation.
- Well. gentlemen. what do you think of it?
-It's inspired. Michael.
- But you're not going to build all of this.
-It's an ambitious undertaking.
Where are you gonna get sufficient property?
Tell them. Fallow.
Well. believe it or not. gentlemen. we're getting it from the government.
From the government?
Exactly.
The government owns Camp Kilson. over 300 acres. just outside the city.
It's to be sold one month from today and they will accept any reasonable offer.
Farrow here is flying to Washington tonight to find out what they consider reasonable--
Your pills. MI. O'Connor.
Oh. Mm.
- Ah. And now. gentlemen--
- Excuse me.
There's a long-distance call from your daughter's school.
- Not now. I'll call her back.
- It isn't your daughter.
It's the headmistress. and she says it's very urgent.
Mull over that project for a moment, gentlemen. I'll be right with you.
- I'll take it in here.
- Yes. sir.
I don't think...
Hello?
Yes. this is MI. O'Connor.
Trudy was missing from class this morning.
I'm terribly afraid she's run away, Mr. O'Connor.
Well. I don't understand this.
Yes. yes. Do that.
And I'll keep you posted.
Thanks.
Goodbye.
MI. O'Connor. anything I can do?
Do you suppose she's gone to he! mother?
I have no idea, but I doubt it.
Fallow. phone our legal department in New Yolk.
I want the best detective agency they can get.
Check every hotel, every airport, railroad and bus station in New York, Chicago...
...and all points west.
Tell New York to keep in constant touch with me till they find her.
Hey. Mac.
Mac. quit playing with the light switch.
Hey. what goes on here?
Jim. what time is it?
Four minutes to 9.
Can't be them.
It's too early.
It can't be who? And who's too early?
Never mind.
Did you say you lived here alone?
- Yes.
- Well. you've got company.
Somebody's coming up the stairs.
Well, you've got pretty good taste, haven't you?
Come on. Shed that mink.
- Who are you?
- A fur trapper.
- Come on, give.
- Get your hands off me.
Okay, sister, you wanna play rough.
I said, take it off.
What are you people doing here?
Oh. we just hang around to see that little gills like you...
...don't swipe great big mink coats like this.
You get out of here before I call the police.
You'll call the police?
That I've gotta see.
There's a phone. Go on. call them.
Oh. just a moment. Uh--
Jim, I'd like to speak to you outside for just a minute.
Excuse us. miss.
Now. remember. no tricks or we'll call the cops.
Psst.
- Say. what's the idea?
- Shh.
What's the idea of you grabbing the phone?
Jim, I'm afraid we're in no position to let her call the police.
Why not?
Because the young lady. no matter who she is...
...has as much light here as we have.
I don't get it.
Aren't you a guest of O'Connor?
Well. yes.
Except that MI. O'Connor doesn't know about it.
But you're a friend of his, aren't you?
That is, if anybody can be a friend of that guy.
Never laid eyes on him.
Our paths have never crossed.
You live here without permission?
- Mm-hm.
- But how do you get away with it?
Oh, it's not hard at all.
MI. O'Connor boards up the house and goes to his estate...
...in Virginia on November 1st.
I move in on November 3rd.
But suppose he comes back?
Oh-ho.
He never comes back till March 15th.
I leave on March 13th.
It works out very well that way.
Why. you old possum.
You're bound to get caught.
You know that.
They never even came close in all the three winters I've been here.
I never do any harm.
As a matter of fact, I do a lot of good.
I dust off the furniture every once in a while.
I wind the clocks.
You take these clothes I'm wearing.
It it weren't to! me. they'd be in the closet gathering moths.
I take them out for an airing every day.
Say. what are we gonna do about her?
You leave it to me.
I'll give he! a lecture and send he! home.
Come on.
- Young lady. we've decided that--
- Please don't call the police.
I know I shouldn't have broken in.
But well, I'm applying for a job tomorrow, and I needed a coat so--
That's a fine excuse.
It isn't an excuse. It's true.
Look. I'll show you.
“Wanted.
Gill with personality to sell sheet music.
Must play piano.
Apply Times Square Melody Shop.“
Oh. sure.
Sure. you've gotta weal a mink coat when you work in a music shop.
They play those Flank Sinatra records. chills run up and down your spine.
It gets cold.
You have to weal a mink coat.
It's the first time
I ever did a thing like this.
Please don't call the police.
Young lady. don't you know there's a law against breaking...
...into other people's homes?
I do but I was alone and hungry and desperate.
'U---
I'll get some water.
Yeah, hurry.
Here.
You feel better?
Much.
Say. when was the last time you ate?
I'd lather not talk about it.
Oh. where do you live?
In Dubuque. with my 13 brothels and sisters.
Fourteen children?
Well, the neighbors must call your house the Stork Club.
These cookies are very nice.
Won't you have one?
The gates patrol.
- Out of sight, quick.
- Here we go again.
Now. wait a minute. Get these dishes.
Pull them up.
Hurry.
Now. into the kitchen. Quick.
Get in here. Quick.
Shh.
I thought I heard something.
It's the gates patrol.
They generally come around every night at 10.
They're a little early tonight.
Yeah, but why the blackout?
Well, I've arranged a gadget at the front door...
...so that all the lights go out when the door opens.
Why do we have to hide in the ice box?
Young lady, you may as well know,
I'm an interloper here, the same as you are.
Oh.
- You mean. you go through this every night?
- Yeah.
You get used to it.
In fact, it's kind of fun after a while.
Hello?
This is Brady. reporting.
Okay at the O'Connor house.
How'd you like to live in a joint like this?
What? And have room for the rest of my wife's relations? Oh.
Here. put this on.
Thanks.
Anybody in that house?
Who are you?
I'm looking for a girl. daughter.
She ain't in there.
That joint's as empty as a sewing basket in a nudist camp.
Young lady. we have decided not to tum you over to the police.
Oh. I was sure you wouldn't.
How can I thank you, Ml...?
McKeever is the name.
Aloysius T. McKeever.
And this is Jim Bullock.
You know, New York is no place for a kid without friends.
I'm not a kid.
And besides, I have friends.
I have you and Mr. McKeever.
Well, yeah, but you're used to a home and a big family.
Besides. the other 13 kids might get lonesome.
Say. you're not all planning to come here. are you?
Oh. no.
I'm thankful you're letting me stay.
But you must go back home.
Oh. please. no.
Not that.
I can't go back to him.
You're married?
It's my father.
He's a drunkard, he's lazy and he beats us.
- Beats all 14 of you?
- Every night.
You're old man's not lazy.
I can't go back.
Please don't send me.
Please.
There, there. I understand.
I wouldn't want any gill to go home to a brute like that.
Now. you stay here.
Just for tonight.
And in the morning. you try to get that job in the music shop.
I'll lend you a coat to weal. but not the mink.
Something less expensive.
You be sure to bring it back.
I will.
Well. it's getting late.
Now. you can sleep in the loom where we found you.
Be sure to make your bed in the morning.
- But don't touch anything.
- I won't.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night, Jim.
Okay. okay.
We'll make it 30 bucks.
You start tomorrow morning.
- Jim.
- Hi.
He hired me. Thirty dollars a week and I start in the morning.
Swell.
What are you doing here?
Oh. just looking around.
For this coat?
- Don't worry. I'll return it.
- Heh.
I'm not worried if you're not.
Jim.
Margie.
Jim Bullock.
- Margie, gee, it's swell to see you.
- Same here.
- What you doing here?
- Same as everybody else.
- Looking for a place to live.
- Heh.
Hi, fellow. What's your name?
- Jackie.
- Oh. this is Jackie.
How's tricks. Jackie?
- He's a dead lingerie! his old man.
- He sure is.
Oh, Jim, this is Alice, Hank's wife.
Jim Bullock.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Hank's wife, huh?
What do you know?
A baby.
Say. he's cute. Hank's?
He helped.
- Where are you living?
- Right here.
- How do you like our penthouse on wheels?
- Swell.
- Where are Hank and Whitey?
- We got a line on an apartment.
They're upstairs. working on the landlord.
Haven't seen those two monkeys since we're in the guardhouse.
I'm going up and surprise them. Excuse me.
Say. where have you been?
Margie. this is Trudy.
Trudy. say hello to Margie.
You gals can talk over old times.
I'll be back in a minute.
- Well. boys. what do you say?
- Oh. yes. sir. we'll take it.
Wrap it up and put our initials on it.
Any deposit?
- Three months rent in advance.
- Three months?
Attention.
Jim.
Why, you ugly pair of goldbricking K.P.'s.
- You're looking great.
- You make a pretty good civilian yourself.
- Ha-ha. Hank. how are you?
- Swell. Jim.
- I got married since the last time I saw you.
- I know.
Met the family downstairs.
A swell-looking baby you rang up there.
And, Whitey, that kid of yours. Ha.
He's a dead linger to! the old man.
The hail. the eyes. the nose...
What's the matter?
Did I say something wrong?
You certainly did.
We don't allow dogs or children.
Oh, look, mister.
What harm is there in a couple of kids?
Why, one of them is only a baby.
They're very small.
They only take up that much space.
- Why, sure.
- One of the kids is sick.
Come on. mister. Give us a bleak.
I'm sorry. It's a rule of the house.
We don't take children.
But we need a place to live.
The kids need a place to live.
- What have you got against children?
-It's a rule.
Naturally. you can't bleak the rule.
If he lets yours in, everybody start having children.
- Then what would happen?
-I’ll tell you what we'll do.
We'll drown them.
Would that make you happy?
- Were you ever a baby?
- No.
He's something left over from meat rationing.
Rules are rules.
Rules are rules.
Come on. Mac. What gives?
Well. you're placing me in a very embarrassing position.
Look. Mac. these people have gotta have a place to live.
You're O'Connor's guest. guest. guests.
It's just until they find a place,
Mr. McKeever.
Please?
Oh. deal.
Not in my 20 years of living as a guest in other people's homes...
...have I ever been faced with a situation like this.
Still. we can't very well tum children away.
Mm-mm.
Ooh.
Cute. A boy?
- Yes.
- Yeah. Ha-ha-ha-ha.
Hello. Hello.
Hello there.
Hello there.
Ahhhh. Boo!
Oh. he's smiling. He's cute.
Well. I guess we can manage somehow.
- Oh. gee. thanks.
- Thanks very much.
- Attaboy. Mac.
- Ha-ha.
Tell me. have you been married long?
- Seven years.
- Oh.
- Are you happy?
- Sure. a great guy.
Say. you're a little crazy about Jim. aren't you?
Oh. he's nice. but he doesn't know I'm alive.
He calls me Cookie.
What did Whitey call you?
- Sugar because I was hard to get.
- Heh.
Tell me. what made him propose?
Well, it happened at the movies.
Gregory Peck and this blond were getting married.
So I said to Whitey. I said.
“Gee. I sure wish that was us.“
And Whitey said. "Uh-huh.“
And then I said,
“Ain't marriage wonderful?“
And Whitey said. "Uh-huh.“
And. then I said.
“Why don't we get married?“
And Whitey said. "Uh-huh.“
And. oh. alter all. how can you say no when a fellow coaxes you like that?
You know. while I was in the Army...
...I heard all about those
$100-. $150-a-week jobs.
What happened to them?
They're around. But you gotta have what it takes to land them.
Yeah. That's what makes it tough.
I sure wish I had some experience at something.
Some guys seem to get by without experience. even without money.
How do you do it, McKeever?
Well, I believe that people who require money should work for it.
As for myself,
I gave up working years ago.
I never could make enough to satisfy my lavish tastes...
...so I let other people work for it, and I enjoy it.
Yeah, but suppose you had a wife and a kid.
Suppose you had to make dough.
My boy, when you come light down to it...
...making money is simply a matter oi analysis.
I'd like to have a blueprint on that one.
All light.
Now. analyze the times.
Figure out what people want most, then try to give it to them.
Now. use yourselves as an example.
What do you want most?
- A job.
- And a place to live.
Exactly.
You'll find plenty of vacancies if you boys just use your heads.
That came out sounding a little different from the way I meant it.
Mac. where ale all these vacancies?
Army barracks.
- Are you kidding?
- Why, no, my boy.
Vacant Army barracks in hundreds of deserted Army camps...
...from coast to coast.
Electricity, gas and water in every one of them.
Say. you know he's got something there.
Mac. you're a genius.
They need guys like you down in Washington.
No.
Things are balled up enough down there.
Army barracks.
It's made to older.
I could redesign them.
A few plumbing changes, closet space, a little landscaping--
Wait, where do we get the dough to pay for all this?
Who's got the dice? We need a couple million bucks in a hurry.
Hey, Jim, where do we get the dough?
- The dough?
- Mm-hm.
Well. we get the dough the same place we get the labor.
Two or three hundred ex-Gl's just like us.
And we're all partners.
Gentlemen. gentlemen.
Your problem of capital is secondary.
Now. the first thing to be considered is which camp you intend to reconvert first.
If the government will sell, and if so, for how much, right?
Right.
Now, do any of you boys know Camp Kilson?
Oh, sure.
That's just outside of New York.
That's where I was induced into the Army.
Induced.
You mean. inducted.
Oh. no. Me. they had to induce. Heh.
Oh. yeah. it's a swell idea...
...but how do we know the government will sell the property?
My boy. go down to Washington and find out.
I was a government clerk there while Hank was overseas.
- I know my way around.
- Swell.
Hank. why don't you and Alice get all the information?
- Yeah.
- But what about the baby?
Oh, gee, that's right.
There's Margie and Trudy.
They'd be glad to take care of him.
And I personally will mix its drinks.
Yeah, I mean supervise its formula.
Well. what do you say. honey?
- Well, all right.
- Good.
Okay. 'fellas.
Alice and I'll drive down tomorrow.
Boy, if this Camp Kilson deal works out, we're really in the chips.
And Mac, that goes for you too.
- After all, this was your idea.
- Heh-heh.
Good evening. everyone.
Has anyone a light?
Now. ahem. as you were saying...
Excuse me.
What are you dressed 101?
I have a date.
Whose dress is that?
Miss O'Connor's
Oh. at it again. huh?
Remember, don't touch that mink coat.
If Mr. McKeever can wear Mr. O'Connor's clothes...
...l guess I can wear Miss O'Connor's.
Hey, be careful with that thing.
Oh. it's not loaded. See?
I know all about guns.
My father used to take me quail hunting.
I thought your old man was a drunkard.
He hunted quail while he was drunk. Heh.
He thought they were ducks.
If you know all about guns, you should know how to aim it.
Show me how you do it.
Well. the Army taught us this way.
First, you place the butt of the gun firmly against the right shoulder.
Mm-hm.
Left hand well forward under the barrel.
Now. you take a good aim.
Now, with the right forefinger firmly on the trigger...
...you squeeze gently.
Squeeze...
Tighter.
Tighter.
Tighter.
It sounded like a shot.
What happened in there?
Trudy.
Hello. Dad.
Well. what a surprise.
So this is why I had to come all the way to New Yolk.
Trudy. I'm a very busy man.
Now, get in the car.
Get in the cal. please.
- Now. then--
- Now. look. Dad.
Before you say anything,
I'm not going back to finishing school.
- And why not?
- Because I'm finished.
Besides. I've met somebody. Dad.
Somebody I like very much.
In fact, I'm in love.
Oh. that's ridiculous.
Why. you're only 18.
My goodness, a girl of 18 is practically middle-aged nowadays.
Women get married at 11 in India.
Yeah. but this isn't India.
Joe. drive to the house.
You can't do that.
Well. why?
Why can't I go to my own house?
Because I'm staying there. only they don't know that I'm me.
Who don't know that you're you?
Mr. McKeever and Jim.
Who the blazes are they?
Mr. McKeever is the man who moves in when you move out.
Do you mean to say you invited two men to live in my house?
No. They just moved in, at least, Mr. McKeever did.
Oh. and who is this Jim?
Oh, he's wonderful.
He thinks I'm a thief, and you're a drunkard...
...and that you beat me.
- This is fantastic.
- Heh-heh .
Squatters living in my house.
Joe, stop the car and pick up the nearest officer you can find.
All right, Dad.
Call the officer, call the whole police force.
Have it your way. You always do.
Trudy.
Trudy. where you going?
That's no concern of yours from now on, Dad.
Goodbye.
Taxi.
Trudy. wait a minute. Trudy.
Trudy. Trudy.
Trudy. Trudy.
Joe, drive to the Waldorf Towers and hurry.
Yes. ma'am.
Now. Trudy. listen. I--
Why, I beg your pardon?
I beg yours.
Why...
I'm too old to be chasing all over town alter you.
You know, honey, I'm still your father.
Now. please sit down.
Now. let's talk this over like two sensible people.
What's troubling you. Trudy?
Dad. I'm terribly unhappy.
Well. why. deal?
I've given you every luxury a gill could want.
And you think I should be happy.
I used to be. years ago. when I was little.
When you were little?
It's true. Dad.
Everything was wonderful then...
...because I had you and mother and that's all that counted.
Then something happened.
I never did know just what.
You and mother separated.
I was sent off to school...
...and I'd lie awake nights trying to figure it out.
I've been lonely. Dad.
That's why I Ian away.
How long have you known this Jim?
All my life, it seems.
What do you want me to do?
Meet Jim.
All light. I'll meet him.
You will?
Thanks. Dad.
Oh. but not as Michael O'Connor.
And what's wrong with Michael O'Connor?
Nothing, but if he knew who you were...
...well. I'd always be wondering.
About what?
If he were really thinking of me or your bank account.
- Oh. Trudy. that's--
- Oh. please. Dad.
You've always had your way.
Let me have mine just once?
Okay. now what?
Well. there you are.
- Twelve dollars, already you look good.
- Yeah.
- Here, here's your hat.
- Heh.
There you are.
Oh. Trudy. this is positively outrageous.
You're not satisfied?
All light.
I throw into the bargain another hat.
It should maybe come from the head of a duke.
Yes. yes. I'm sure it did. I'm sure.
Pay him the money. Let's get...
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.
- Huh?
How much will you allow me lo! these?
Well. $6.
Six dollars for a brand-new tailor-made outfit?
Your suit is all-wool.
- Why, certainly, it's all-wool.
- Oh...
That's bad.
Wool is bad?
Look. when the moths are healing
I got here an all-wool suit...
...one moth tells the other.
They're coming for a banquet.
They're bringing their friends.
Pretty soon.
I got here a moth convention.
A splay gun. I gotta buy.
Insecticide. I gotta buy...
...all night long.
I am staying and spraying.
I'm not coming home.
My wife is getting mad.
She's leaving for Reno.
She's getting a divorce.
What am I getting?
Custody of the moths.
Alimony I am paying.
Payments I am missing.
To jail I'm going. My business I'm losing.
I'm a bum.
All because you are bringing in here an all-wool suit.
Pay him quick before he names me correspondent.
Oh. look at that pool man on the bench.
- What's the matter with him?
- Can't you see? He's cold and hungry.
How can you see he's hungry?
Well. he must be.
Mr. McKeever, couldn't we invite him?
Trudy. please.
You know how crowded the house is now.
And we can't take in every tramp in New Yolk.
Oh, there's lots of food and lots of room.
- Hello.
- Hello.
What's your name?
Mike.
Hi. Mike. I'm Trudy.
And this is Jim.
- How are you?
- Hi.
I've seen your face someplace.
Could be. I've been following it around for a long time.
This hooligan been trying to make a touch. lady?
Oh, no, officer, he--
If it's a place to sleep you want, try a flophouse.
If you're hungry, try the soup kitchens.
But no loafing in the park.
Go on.
- Beat it.
- Now. look.
But, officer, he's a friend of mine, ours.
In fact, he's a relative.
Don't worry, officer.
We'll take care of him.
Huh“
Oh, the poor man, he's weak from hunger.
He doesn't look undernourished to me.
My good man. would you care to come home and have a bite with us?
Of course he would.
And there on your light...
...that big. brownstone mansion that's all boarded up...
...that is the townhouse oi the great industrial wizard, Michael J. O'Connor...
...the second-richest man in the world.
Hmm . ls this my home or a laundry?
Shh.
Heh. Well, Mike. you see. we're all one big happy family here.
Now, make yourself at home.
I'll try.
Mighty nice lounging lobe you have there.
I'm glad you like it.
Say. you know. I believe we're about the same size.
Maybe I'll let you weal it sometime.
Oh, I wouldn't deprive you.
Cigar smells pretty good too.
Well. I might let you smoke one sometime.
Thank you.
Hey, you better go and scrub up a bit, you're pretty dirty.
I'll go and rustle you up some food.
He tells me to scrub up. Aah!
Oh. Mike. are you all light?
Oh. what happened? Ale you hurt?
Trudy. who is this woman?
And why has she elected a gallows in the reception hall?
This is Margie. Mike.
I'm terribly sorry. but we have to hang the wash in here.
Why?
Well. we can't very well hang it outside. can we?
Trudy. I don't mean to be inquisitive...
...but how many people are living in this house?
Maybe I should install a loom clerk.
Great Scott. what's that?
That's Jim.
He's building a barracks in the cellar.
A barrack--? Isn't this house big enough?
Does he have to build a barracks in the cellar?
- Come and get it, Mike.
- Come and get what?
- Shh. Food.
- Yeah. Oh.
Trudy. Trudy. take a look.
A complete model.
Each barrack, when partitioned off, will house 12 families.
Two bedrooms. bath. living loom. kitchen {or each.
Jim, that's wonderful.
Mike. Jim and Whitey are going to buy Army barracks...
...and transform them into model houses.
- It's a wonderful idea.
- Great.
I suggest they build a model poorhouse too...
...so they can all move in when the idea fizzles.
Well, that's gratitude for you.
You feed a guy like that and he gets sarcastic.
Yeah. what's he sole about?
Well. he'll be more sociable when he eats. won't you?
Well. go ahead. Mike. Dig in.
I better not. Something lighter, perhaps.
Hmm?
Maybe he'd like to have some crépe suzettes.
Or some breast of hummingbird on toast.
All I want is milk and crackers. that is ii you gentlemen don't mind.
- Milk and crackers?
- Ulcers.
Only the rich get ulcers.
Oh, what he means is that he hasn't eaten for so long...
...his stomach won't hold solid food.
Mike, isn't that it?
Yes, that's what I should have said.
Trudy, don't forget the baby's milk.
Oh, my goodness, I forgot.
Oh, it's way past his feeding time.
Mm-hm.
Great little mother. isn't she?
Hmm. Mother.
Mother?
Baby?
Oh. no. it can't be. She's been in school.
Baby.
Oh; my'
Trudy. I'd like to have a talk with you.
Does it have to be light now?
Right now. It's most important.
Now, first, I want to ask--
Hello.
Hello. sweetie. Yes.
Look at the little darling.
Isn't he an angel?
You know. he's got dimples just like yours.
Ahem. Madam. would you mind if I spoke with my--?
With Trudy alone, please.
Trudy.
I have just thought this all over.
What's done is done.
I consent to the marriage.
You're still my daughter and I'll stand by your choice.
Oh. Dad. you will? Really?
Of course I will, darling.
But just tell me one thing.
Where did you meet this Jim?
How did all this happen?
I don't really know myself.
He was just another man when I first met him.
I think it happened in the ice box.
In the ice box?
We were hiding from the gates patrol.
It was cold and his arm was around me.
Mr. McKeever was there too.
McKeever was there?
Oh. yes. the whole time.
Heh. He wanted to send me away afterward, but I wouldn't go.
He's really very nice.
Yeah. he must be.
You'll like Jim too when you get to know him better.
Eh-- I'm sure I will.
Well. I guess there's no use crying over spilled milk.
You say you love this fellow?
- Very much.
- Very well then.
If you're married, you're married.
Congratulations.
You have my blessing.
But, Dad, we're not married.
You're not married?
- No. He hasn't asked me yet.
- He ha--?
Jim's funny.
He takes his time about doing things.
He does. eh?
I don't even know if he wants to marry me.
H he wan
Hmm!
What kind of a man is he?
That chicken-hearted blackguard.
I'll kill him.
I'll kill him with my bale hands. clothing.
- Hello.
- Did you think we were never coming back?
- How did you like playing nursemaid?
- I enjoyed every minute of it. Ha-ha.
Hello. darling.
- Did you get lonesome for Mommy?
- Heh.
- Say. I hope he wasn't much bother.
- Not at all.
I only wish he were mine.
Pardon me. ls that your baby?
- Well, my husband has a half interest.
- Uh-huh.
She's a pretty little thing, isn't he? Hmm.
Hank. what's the dope?
What happened in Washington?
Oh, brother.
What a merry-go-round that is.
I've been through so many revolving doors.
I'm still traveling in circles.
Well. they're willing to sell the land. barracks and all.
But there's a catch.
Yeah. there always is.
They've had an offer of 150,000“.
...and the property is to be sold in 10 days to the highest bidder.
Buck up. we're not licked yet.
We'll offer them 160,000.
Who will offer who 160,000?
Gentlemen, there's no harm in making an offer.
If they accept, then is the time to worry...
...about where you are gonna get the 160.000.
The essence of big business, gentlemen...
...is never put one worry ahead of another.
Here you are. Mike.
Oh. thank you.
You're terribly sloppy.
You'll have to be more orderly or you can't stay.
As a matter of fact, your staying here tonight...
...is against my better judgment.
I'm sorry to inconvenience you.
Well. it's these spells you have. these fits.
Now. I can't have you upstairs near the women and children.
You'll have to sleep in the servant's loom downstairs.
Sam sleeps in there too.
He'll balk at about 7 a.m.
Let him out in the yard.
I won't have to get up so early.
Hello. Phillips? It's me.
- Did Farrow get back from Washington?
- No, sir, Mr. O'Connor.
He's flying in tomorrow morning.
Well, tell him I'll call him at the office.
No, no, no. I'm not kidnapped.
No, I'm in town, in an ice box.
I can't tell you where.
In the meantime. listen.
Wile Wickelsham and tell him
I'll take 6 million lo! that West Coast chain.
Oh.
Did Mason make an offer for that steel mill lease?
What? A million and a half?
No, tell him no soap.
Nothing less than 3 million.
And if American Foods goes up half a point tomorrow, sell a hundred thousand shares.
Right. And if you--
Mike, come out of that ice box.
Mike. ii you insist on using the telephone in here...
...I’d suggest you weal an overcoat.
I know it's a great temptation. but you must control it.
- Control what?
- This playing at being a millionaire.
Just because you're living in a millionaire': house.
Maybe I am a millionaire.
All right, Mike. You're a millionaire.
Now. come on.
You've got a million dishes to wash.
Not with that. You might bleak them.
Come on.
Please. Over here.
Not here. over there.
Can I get in bed with you?
No. Go get in bed with your father.
- I can't.
- Why not?
Because he's in bed with my mother.
Look. sonny. I'm tiled and I wanna get some sleep.
Now. you run along.
Now, I'm sure the sandman is looking for you.
Good night, sonny. good night.
Have a good. good. good--
Dad. Dad. are you awake?
Awake?
How can anybody sleep in this bear trap?
Tum on those lights.
You'll wake the whole house up.
All right, let them wake up.
Help me up here.
- Help me up.
- What happened?
Well. help me up.
Trudy. let me tell you something.
I control a dozen corporations. coal mines. steamships. railroads.
I push a button and make a bank president.
But never in my whole life has anyone ever made a fool of me.
Washing dishes.
A servant in my own house, to a crowd of squatters.
A valet to a dog.
He barks at 7 and I have to take him for a promenade.
And as for that Mr. McBeetle...
...who smokes my cigars and wears my clothes and drinks my brandy...
...he's leaving this house in the morning.
Yes, and that goes for your precious Jim too.
But, Dad, you promised.
And where would they go?
They have no place and this big house with nobody living in it.
It just isn't right. And as for Jim.
Yeah. he'll be the first to go.
Believe me.
What kind of a man is he?
Why doesn't he go to work?
He's going to. Dad.
He's got a marvelous idea.
He's really going places.
He sure is. light out on the sidewalk.
- But, Dad.
-I’ve had enough.
Now. Trudy. listen...
...I want all of these people out of this house in 24 hours...
...or I'm having them arrested for vagrancy and trespassing.
Dad. please.
You heard me.
24 hours or I'm calling the police.
Good night.
Hello. Western Union?
I wanna send a telegram. please.
To Mrs. Mary O'Connor.
Royal Palms Hotel...
...Palm Beach. Florida.
“Deal mother...
...please fly New Yolk at once.
Will contact you, Waldorf Towers.
Terribly urgent.
Love. Trudy.“
Yes. darling.
I'm sure you're in love with this Jim.
You have all the symptoms.
- What does your father think of him?
- Dad's going to have him arrested.
Well. whatever 101? Loving you?
No. For trespassing.
Well, that's the same thing, isn't it?
To your father.
I think it's awful of him, mother.
Those people haven't done a single thing but live in that big old. vacant house.
Well. there must be more than one way to skin a cat or an O'Connor.
Of course, darling,
I haven't seen your father in four years.
But I think I know just how to cope with this situation.
Your household will have to make room for another guest.
You. mother?
- Why not?
- Well...
Don't worry. I won't give anything away.
Oh. mother. you're an angel.
I can't understand how Dad ever let you go.
Oh. honey.
There are lots of things about your father that are difficult to understand.
Well, now, I'll take my face off, and--
Oh. where am I going to find some old clothes?
I know just the place.
Mike.
Rule number one in this house...
...is never come in or go out through that front door.
Oh. I'm sorry.
Where did you get the key?
Hound the key while I was cleaning.
Well. come on. hand it over.
Why. I must be dreaming.
Smells like slumgullion.
Slumgullion?
It's a kind of an Irish stew.
I haven't eaten it for years.
As a matter of fact, it was on account of slumgullion I fell in love and got married.
It must be quite a dish.
Yes. she was.
My wife made the finest slumgullion in the whole state.
We?
Well. I don't see he! anymore.
We’re divorced. I--
By George. that is slumgullion.
Yeah. could be.
We've got a cook now.
Slumgullion.
Taste familiar?
Mary.
Hello. Michael.
Well. this is a surprise.
I thought it would be.
May I ask what are you doing here?
Same thing you're doing here.
I came to meet Jim.
Oh.
And have you had that extreme pleasure?
I have. and I found him to be everything Trudy said he was.
Oh. indeed. indeed.
You've taken on a little weight since I last saw you. in the wrong places.
It's the clothes, and you're no Van Johnson yourself.
I can remember when you only had one chin.
- Indeed. Well, let me tell you--
- Shh.
Stop shushing me. I won't--
We're going to dispose of this nonsense once and for all.
Imagine an 18-year-old gill wanting to many this--
You married me when I was 17.
And look what happened to us.
Nothing happened to us that a little fidelity couldn't have cured.
Ale you accusing me oi infidelity? lam.
You left me and married your money.
Nonsense.
And besides. I resent your being here.
Trudy belongs in school and that's where she's going.
Shh. Not so loud.
You listen to me. Michael O'Connor.
Trudy is in love with a young man and she wants to win him the hard way.
Not with your money.
Instead of admiring her for it, you're fighting her...
...just as you've always battled anyone who wouldn't bend to your will.
You just haven't the courage to see this through.
Oh, I haven't?
That's what I said.
I can stick this out just as long as you can.
Longer. do you heal? Longer.
- That I'll have to see.
- Hah.
I'll give you three days.
Three days over these pots and pans with your manicured fingernails...
...and then you'll slink back to Palm Beach...
-...and your favorite beauty parlor.
- Ha.
And another thing. you might as well realize light now...
...that this house isn't big enough for both of us.
All light. When are you leaving?
Hey. what goes on in here?
Mike and Mary had a little argument but it's all over now.
A new cook and already a fight in the kitchen?
Now. you two should learn to get along together.
Stew.
Mary. it this tastes as good as it smells. you're gonna be my new pinup gill.
Ha-ha. Thanks.
But Trudy’s been helping me with it.
Oh. she has. huh? Well. keep he! busy.
Mike. I want you to quit picking on Mary.
Good cooks are hard to find.
Cookie, I've got some great news for you.
I'm all ears.
Whitey and Hank got a couple hundred of the boys together.
They're all steamed up and raring to go.
Between us. we've averaged about 500 apiece.
And I went to see the Wheeler Construction Company today.
They went for the idea in a big way.
- They may even put up the money we need.
- Tell me more.
I'm seeing the head of the outfit on Friday.
BOY. it this idea works out.
I'll buy this joint from O'Connor.
- Hello.
- Hello, Farrow, it's me.
Listen. do we still own an interest in Wheeler Construction?
Good. Now. pay attention.
There's a young man coming in there Friday named Jim Bullock.
He has some half-baked ideas about model houses or barracks, or something.
I want them to disregard the idea and offer him a job.
Yes. yes. I don't ca--
I don't care ii it's teaching Eskimos the Boogie Woogie...
...or milking whales in Patagonia, only it must be out of the country.
Huh? Anywhere.
Make it Bolivia.
The farther away. the better.
There's only one stipulation.
He has to be a single man.
Single. you idiot.
That means unmarried.
Yeah.
I don't care. Make up any excuse.
Only offer him enough so that he can't refuse.
Yeah, right. You got it?
Okay. Now, how about that property?
We've been topped again.
The price is now 185.000.
Offer them 190,000.
I don't care if we're bucking
Morgan and Chase, I want that property.
Well, if you need cash, transfer a couple of million from the Chicago house.
- Right? Hmm?
- Oh. Mike.
I'm sorry to interrupt your negotiations.
I know you have millions and millions of dollars hanging in the balance...
...but, Mike, you didn't make your bed this morning.
- Good. Good.
-Isn't this good?
Don't hold back.
There's plenty more in the kitchen.
- Will you hand me the butter?
- Yeah.
May I have a bit more. please?
Ha. What about your milk and cracker diet? a lot better.
Ah. That proves what I've always believed.
Indigestion is caused by unhappiness.
If you don't like the things the world makes you do...
...you're not hungry.
But if you smile and you're happy...
...you enjoy life and you're hungry all the time.
I wonder if the O'Connors were as happy in this house as we are?
Happy?
From what I hear, they're the most snarled uppest people in the whole world.
- What's wrong with them?
- Plenty.
Now, you take Michael O'Connor, for example.
A pool boy who became the second-richest man in the world.
Almost the richest. So I heal.
Yeah. and is he happy? I should say not.
They tell me...
...he's one of the worst-tempered men in the country.
I heal O'Connor is so high-hat...
...he won't accept a glass of beer unless it's got a winged collar on it. ever seen his picture in the papers.
Yeah. what does the guy look like?
An octopus.
Now. Jim. let's have no personalities. please.
After all. house.
And eating his food and wearing his clothes.
Which reminds me. he needs some new white shirts.
Now. as I was about to say...
...he's a sourpuss with a sour stomach...
...that's so engrossed in his holding companies...
...that he couldn't hold his wife and family together.
Maybe his wife walked out on him.
If she's smart, she ran.
From what I heal. she's no bargain either.
They say she's really snarled up...
...lives in a big house down at Palm Beach and spends most of her time...
...trying not to admit she's a middle-aged woman.
Suppose we talk about something else.
Hmm?
You're right, Mary.
It's a waste of breath.
Mike. you had enough?
I've had plenty.
Oh. Mike. your dishes.
Now, please be a little more careful of them.
I found a couple of them chipped last night.
You see what I mean, Mike?
These shelves were jam-packed when all you people came to live with me.
When I lived here alone. what I ate was never missed...
...but 11 of us, well, that would make a dent in any larder.
Mike. it looks as though you and I will have to go to work.
Me? Work?
Oh. no. Ha-ha.
Why. Trudy’s working.
Jim and the other boys chip in money for food.
Mary does the cooking. and I...
Well, I sort of supervise.
I’ll tell you. Mike. honest labor never hurt any man.
At least, it never did me.
That I can understand. and it's not going to hurt me either.
Now. get this...
...neither you nor any man is going to make me do manual labor...
...and that's final.
- Oh. well. Mike.
- No. no. sir.
No, no, that's going too far.
Oh, no.
- Well. you're doing fine. Mike.
- Yeah.
You know. we're getting a dollar an hour to! this job.
Not bad. eh?
After we get this cleared off,
I've arranged for another one.
The movie theater down the street.
Don't tire yourself out.
We're getting $1 .10 for that job.
Say. you know. I think I can help you.
Why, I wouldn't want you to exert yourself.
Well. alter all.
I should be doing something.
Ah.
I know what.
I'll get you a bigger shovel.
Mr.
Shh.
Shh. Quick. Get in the cal, get in the cal.
Don't look surprised, get in the cal.
MI. O'Connor. what is this?
Now. now. now. wait a minute.
Don't ask questions. just answer them.
What about that government property?
Our offer's been topped again.
Our opponents. whoever they are. have gone to 195.
Ah. Well, offer them 200,000.
Any clue as to who's bucking us?
Not yet, but don't worry, sir.
I won't let it drop.
Good. good. good.
- Now, what about that young fellow?
- Young fellow?
Jim Bullock. the fellow I phoned you about.
Oh. yes.
He was in to see Henderson of Wheeler Construction this morning.
Henderson has full instructions to offer him that job in Bolivia.
Ah. Excellent, Farrow, excellent.
If he accepts, and there's no reason he shouldn't...
...all of my troubles are over.
Heh-heh
Well. okay. Fallow. see you later.
MI. O'Connor. are you all light?
Never felt better in my life. Heh.
- MI. O'Connor.
- Yes?
- Your shovel.
- Oh.
Oh. thank you. thank you. thank you.
Ha-ha.
Come on, Mike, hurry up.
Here. let me help you.
Oh. thank you.
Mike. have you had a hard day?
No, nothing to speak of.
I merely shoveled snow off half of Manhattan, that's all. Oof.
Be careful, Mike, something cracked.
That was my back.
Oh. Mike. it did you good.
You have color in your cheeks.
Why. you look positively healthy.
I'm sick. I'm dying.
Hello. boys.
Hello. Jim.
Oh. hello. Mike.
- Ah-ah!
- Careful of those Christmas bulbs.
Well, heh, it looks like you fellows are expecting Santa Claus.
Confidentially. there ain't no Santa Claus. we know.
Anything wrong? Ahem.
Uh-- How'd you make out?
I mean. with Wheeler Construction?
They turned thumbs down on our proposition...
...but they did offer me a job in Bolivia.
Twelve thousand a year and all expenses.
Well. that's great, Jim.
That's a lot of money.
When are you leaving?
Ale you kidding?
Why would I wanna go to Bolivia?
Well, wonderful country, fine climate, beautiful girls down there.
They're not bad up here either.
But, Jim...
Bolivia is the tin capital oi the world.
Look. Mike.
I like the good old U.S.A. and that ain't tin.
If I can't make a living here, then I'll give up.
Besides. I couldn't let guys like Hank and Whitey down.
They and others have put their time, faith and dough into an idea.
I'd be a heel to walk out.
I don't wanna be inquisitive...
...but what is this big idea you think is so important?
I know it has something to do with barracks--
An Army camp.
Government's selling. we're trying to buy it.
Army camp. Oh.
- Where?
- Just outside the city.
You mean. Camp Kilson?
You're a bright boy.
Go to the head of class.
Yeah. we thought we could get it cheap...
...but some drip has bid us up to 190.000.
Oh. excuse me. Mike.
You mean to say you fellas have been bidding on that property?
Well. sure.
Say. Mike. why are you so interested?
Oh. I'm not interested.
Doesn't mean anything to me. Only I-- Heh.
I was just wondering, what are you using for money, clam shells?
No, we got a hundred thousand that we collected from our partners...
...fellows just like us.
Yeah. but you bid up to 190.000.
That's way over your capital.
We know it. But we'll get the dough.
Tomorrow's another day.
We're not licked yet.
Hello.
Have you ever seen Santa Claus?
Sonny...
...there are some people who think I'm Santa Claus.
Why?
A little more to the right, Mary.
Down a little further.
That's it. That's it.
Ahh.
Heh. I feel better already.
- Mary?
- Yes, Mike.
Do you remember that old railroad flat we had?
Twelve dollars a month and we thought it was expensive.
- Well. it was the nicest flat on the block.
- Hmm.
Remember how we used to sit out on the front steps on hot summer nights?
Me with my can oi bee! and you with your bag oi cherries...
...spitting the stones at Finnigan's goat.
Yes. only it wasn't Finnigan's.
It was Murphy's goat.
No, no, no. It was Finnigan's.
Well. I guess I ought to know which goat I spit at.
That was fun, wasn't it?
We had lots of friends in those days.
Heal friends .
Yes, and you had lots of muscle.
Real muscle.
Now you're flabby as an old seal.
Yeah. who's flabby? Ow. ow! Oh.
- Mary.
- Ha-ha.
Mike.
I must ask you, Mike. to return to your room at once.
- Now. just a minute you--
- Go to your loom.
Hmm .
Hmm .
Mary. I'll talk to you in the morning.
What's the matter?
- Jim.
- Yeah?
If my name weren't Trudy Smith, if it were something else...
...would it matter?
Oh-ho-ho. Cookie.
I don't know and I don't care what your name is.
But whatever it is. the minute I land a job...
...I’ll give you a chance to change it.
Good morning. Mary.
Good morning. Mike. How's your back?
Well, fair on one side, bad on the other.
Oh. Mike.
I didn't sleep very well last night.
I think this mattress ought to be turned over.
Will you give me a hand. please?
I hope you and Mary don't think
I was being a bit stuffy about last night.
Only you must remember there are young people in the house...
...and we older folks mustn't set a bad example.
I assure you, Mr. McKeever, it was all perfectly innocent.
Well, let's forget it.
Except that I hope
I didn't give you the impression...
...that I was opposed to a man and a woman falling in love.
Now. you take this bed.
It was made for a man and his wife...
...only the wife is in Florida and the husband is in Virginia.
You know, when you think of all the people who fall out of love...
...even though they have everything...
...it's kind of nice to think of people like you falling in love.
Look. Mac.
There are some things that you just don't quite understand.
Oh. yes. I do. Mike.
It's very plain.
Mary is in love with you.
May I come in?
Sure.
Mike. I've been thinking.
- Why don't you and Mary get married?
- Married?
It might be the best thing in the world for both of you.
Might make something oi your lives.
Maybe it's too late.
Oh. it's never too late.
Now. you take Mike here...
...he's a nice enough fellow but what has he made oi his existence?
Absolutely nothing.
Now. Mary is a fine woman and a fine cook.
Responsibility would be the best thing for both of you.
And marriage means responsibility.
Whatever you do. don't end up like me.
You know. ii I were a younger man.
I might be asking Mary to many me.
Think it over.
Oh, Mary, what's the matter with both of us?
Why don't we call all this off?
Call what off, Michael?
Mary. listen to me.
I love you very much.
I've always loved you.
There's never been another woman in my life but you.
No, I mean that.
Why do think I've been hanging around here submitting to all this?
Because you're here. because I want you.
Because I've been hoping...
I've been hoping that we might...
Mary, I never wanted that divorce.
I never wanted it either.
Oh.
Oh. Michael.
You seem to have changed.
It's almost like old times.
I have changed and I'm going to change even more.
I promise.
All right, folks, that's enough of that.
Just as I suspected.
Well. I'll be a monkey's orphan.
Oh. come. sir.
Your family connections must be better than that.
All right, Santa, saddle up your reindeer and let's gallop down to headquarters.
Now. one moment, gentlemen.
These people are not doing any harm.
They're not thieves. no! are they vandals.
- Who are you?
- McKeever's the name.
Aloysius T. McKeever.
And I wish you a very Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas .
How long you been living here?
Well, I've been here for the past three winters.
And speaking for my friends here.
They're very nice people... max-servicemen with their wives and children...
...who are merely, shall we say, taking advantage of much-needed shelter.
You wouldn't want to arrest them on Christmas Eve. now. would you?
No.
And this nice couple here...
...is Mary and Mike. who are soon to be married.
You see. romance has flourished within our boarded windows.
Oh. Mary. this is the nicest
Christmas present I've ever had.
Thank you. deal.
Mike.
I'm happy. Terribly happy.
Congratulations.
Been married 22 years myself.
- Well, well.
- Twenty-two years? My, that's wonderful.
Yeah. marriage is a great thing.
No family should be without it.
Now, take my wife, a great little woman.
Sits home night after night.
All alone? On Christmas Eve?
All alone and never a beef.
Well. call he! up and ask he! to come on over.
- No kidding? You mean it?
- Of course I do.
- How about it, folks?
- Why sure. go ahead.
Tell he! to come on over and have some fun.
Gee, that's swell of you people.
Moitle would sure like that.
A great little woman.
Hello. Moitle. it's me. Cecil.
Your husband.
Yeah. honey. I'm at a little party.
It's that big gloomy-looking joint on Fifth Avenue.
The O'Connor place.
Tell her not to come in through the front door.
We have a hole in the back fence.
Don't come through the front door.
There's a hole in the back fence.
You crawl through the hole and--
How could you say that, baby?
I ain't touched a drop.
That isn't nice, Moitle.
Well, if that's the way you feel.
- She says she ain't got nothing to weal.
- Oh-ho.
Moitle's a great little woman.
We've been married 22 years.
She ain't never laid a fist on me except in self-defense.
Well. thanks lo! the invite anyway.
We'll be running along.
They're not doing any harm. are they?
Hello. Brady reporting.
Okay at the O'Connor house.
- Exceptionally okay.
- Eee-ha!
How about it. everybody?
[ALL SINGING
“FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW“
Shh!
Shh! Shh!
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, please.
Folks. Do us a favor, will you?
Don't sing so loud.
It leaks through the boards.
Anything you say. gentlemen.
Will you have some cigars?
- Oh. thanks.
- Gee. thanks.
- Merry Christmas .
- Merry Christmas .
- May I have one, please?
- Oh. sure.
Thank you.
Well, folks, you can stay for the holidays, but try and be gone after New Year's.
You know, if O'Connor heard about this, we'd get fired.
- Heh-heh.
- Well, take care of things, will you?
Oh. boy. are these good.
Jim. what's the matter?
Oh. nothing.
Oh. now. something's wrong.
What is it?
Well. we've lost out.
- That barracks property's been sold.
- Sold?
- Well. who'd they sell it to?
- To Michael J. O'Connor.
Here. lead it and weep.
Well. boys. that washes us up.
“Outbidding all competitors.
Industrial wizard Michael J. O'Connor...
...has today added Camp Kilson to his other vast holdings.“
How about that O'Connor?
How do you like that?
He wants to buy up everything.
Doesn't leave anything for anyone else.
- He's got about everything now.
- Yeah.
Oh. Mike.
Now. look. Mary. How did I know they were bidding on that property?
- I'm no mind leader.
- Mm-hm.
- When did you find out?
- Just a couple of days ago.
I only did what I considered light from a business standpoint.
- After all, I--
- Don't get belligerent.
- I didn't say anything.
- But you're thinking.
- Of course I'm thinking.
- Mm.
I'm thinking what a nice Christmas present it would be to! Trudy and Jim and the lest.
Oh. their idea is harebrained and nonsensical. It won't make a dime.
Oh, maybe not.
But it'd make an awful lot of people happy.
You never did understand that business and sentiment don't mix.
Why is it that every“?
Oh. look. Mary. let's not gel sidetracked in a silly financial discussion.
Why should we start off arguing again?
Michael J. O'Connor.
I was wrong.
You haven't changed a bit.
And you never will.
Never.
Jim.
Jim, it's beautiful.
I didn't like the idea of you in borrowed clothes.
- I hope it fits.
- It will.
Here. let me help you.
Oh. it's lovely.
Cookie. it may not be mink. but you sure make it look like it.
I really can't take it, Jim.
Why not? It's a gift.
I know. but you shouldn't have done it.
You can't afford it.
Well. it's Christmas.
Hey, hey. What's the matter?
Jim, you're wonderful.
Wonderful.
Mike.
Women are funny.
You give them something to make them happy and they cry about it.
Hmm. You think that's funny? Heh.
Wait till you get to be my age.
What“?
What are you planning on doing now. Jim?
Nothing. What is there to do?
In the morning, I've gotta get down to the barracks and tell the gang the deal is off.
I'd lather take a beating than do that.
Mind if I go along with you?
If you like.
I don't see how you can help any.
Wait a minute. fellows. Wait a minute.
Now, I probably like O'Connor a lot less than any of you...
...but in this case, he's perfectly within his rights.
He owns half the town.
Why should he grab this property?
We'll buy it from him.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
I know it's a tough bleak. 'fellows. but there's no use beefing about it.
We tried and we failed.
Would you mind standing aside?
I asked you to stand aside. young man.
Say please.
May I ask what ale all you men doing here?
We've been holding a meeting.
Union Square is for that purpose.
Take your soapbox down there.
This is private property.
See that this property is cleared and no trespassing signs elected.
And those barracks.
Get those people out at once.
They're wives and kids of some of the men.
Give them a chance.
They have no place to go.
I can't help that.
Now. gentlemen. we want action.
I want all those barracks tom down...
...and construction started as soon as possible.
Who is that little creep?
Say. maybe it's O'Connor.
Yeah.
Could be.
O'Connor. huh?
Hey, it's O'Connor.
Hey. 'fellows. it's O'Connor.
Who did that?
I'll have you run off this property.
I'll have you arrested.
Well. let's have it.
You know who I am? Who are you?
Police.
Police! Police!
Give me that.
It's got a game leg.
What is this. a pinball machine?
Sugar?
Swell number.
I wonder if the musicians will know it down in Bolivia?
- You're really going?
- Sure.
Twelve thousand a year is too much dough to pass up when you haven't got a job...
...or a place to live.
Well. I guess I don't know the combination.
You must have decided in an awful hurry.
The Army taught us to do things in a hurry.
Didn't the Army teach you to fight harder when the going got tough?
Oi course.
In the Army you're fighting with guns.
In this fight, the bullets are greenbacks.
And O'Connor has all the ammunition.
Look. Trudy.
I'll only be gone a year or so.
That's a long time.
Well. maybe you better not wait.
Maybe I shouldn't.
If you run short, I'll send you some cash so you won't have to borrow any clothes.
Don't worry. I'll get plenty of clothes.
From that guy with the champagne?
Listen, you'd better stay away from that wolf.
At least a wolf doesn't run away from you like a rabbit.
You guys scram. Check out.
I said check out.
Check out?
Ah. Checkoutsky. Russian.
Oh. Ha. Hey!
Jim, all that stands between you and the top of the ladder is--
Ahhhh
You can't climb with an anchor around your neck.
- So you think I'm an anchor?
- I didn't say that.
You did and you can go straight to Bolivia and stay there.
Do you heal me? Stay there!
Jim's leaving.
Leaving?
Well, maybe it's all for the best.
Where's he going?
To Bolivia for some company.
Wheeler Construction. that's it.
Oh. darling. ii you really love Jim. you many him and go with him.
I can't. They only want single men.
Well. that's strange.
Well, in fact, it's ridiculous.
Wheeler Construction.
Single men only.
If I remember correctly, your father owns that company.
Dad. do you mean to say that you deliberately planned to“?
Of all the contemptible--
- All right, Mary.
- Ugh.
We'll forget about Bolivia.
Michael J. O'Connor, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
If you want to marry Jim, it's all right with me.
I'll give him a job here.
What kind of a job?
Doing something. I don't know. but it'll be a job...
...nice office, secretary, good salary, all the trimmings.
Dad, can't you understand?
He wants to stand on his own two feet.
Jim has ability. whether you think so or not and I'd lather he go anywhere...
...than be one of your army of high-salaried yes men.
I'll be leaving tomorrow. Michael.
And when I leave.
Trudy will be going with me.
So you'll have this whole house all to yourself again.
I hope you'll be very happy in it.
Did you say something?
No.
Where is everybody?
I don't know. I guess they're all down in the dumps the same as I am.
You know. I don't think
I'll be coming back here next winter.
Why? What's wrong with this place?
Since Jim and the boys lost their property...
...all the laughter and happiness is gone.
This place seems like a morgue.
You know. I think I'll try the Guggenhoff mansion next season.
The Guggenhoff mansion?
Oh. that place doesn't compare with this.
Everybody knows that the
Guggenhoff place has bad plumbing...
...and besides. they don't have ail conditioning...
...and that's something to be considered.
Mike. a house. any house.
Is only what its occupants make it.
No, this place doesn't seem the same.
I think I'll get a cup of coffee.
Hello. Jim.
Would you care for a cup of coffee?
No, thanks.
'U---
- I heal you're leaving.
- Yep.
Going down to see Wheeler Construction today.
Jim. you don't want to go to Bolivia.
Why not?
You tried to sell me that deal once.
What changed your mind?
Well. I thought perhaps that it you had a talk with MI. O'Connor...
...you wouldn't have to go to Bolivia.
Talk with him? How are you gonna talk with him it you can't even see him?
Well. I have a friend who works in the O'Connor building.
Charlie's his name. Charlie Graham.
He and I used to ride the rods together.
He's head janitor there now and believe it or not...
...O'Connor and Charlie are like two peas in a pod.
I hope you won't mind. Jim...
...but I asked Charlie to ask Mr. O'Connor for an appointment for you.
- And guess what.
-I’m guessing.
Charlie just phoned me and said...
...that MI. O'Connor would see you in one hour.
Mike. are you feeling all light?
Mike. you're having hallucinations again.
No, no, no. Not this time.
No, I know what I'm saying.
Don't pass up this chance. Jim.
Better go now.
Okay. Mike. We'll give it a try.
It won't be the first office
I've been thrown out of. And, Mike...
...if anything happens, we'll cut you in.
- How do you do? I--
- Good morning. gentlemen. expecting you.
Will you go light in?
Thank you.
Farrow, I told you to transfer some cash to our Paris office.
Two million? Do you expect them to operate with pennies?
Cable them 3 million more light away.
Can't I leave this office five minutes without things going haywire?
Where are those lumber contracts?
Call San Francisco and tell them...
...if the contracts aren't here tomorrow the deal is off.
Anything happen on that steel mill lease?
I don't care what it costs.
I want it closed today.
Yeah, right.
And by the way. cable Kennedy in London...
...and tell him we'll sell our British and Canadian holdings lo! 12 million.
If my American Can goes up tomorrow, sell a hundred thousand shares.
Right.
Hello. boys.
Mike. What are you doing behind O'Connor': desk?
- You gone nuts?
- How'd you get in here?
We'd better get him out before O'Connor comes in.
We-- Uh--
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.
- Good morning. gentlemen.
- Good morning.
Where's MI. O'Connor?
We haven't seen him.
We have an appointment with him.
What's that?
- Well. it ain't mice.
- Help. Somebody open this door.
Open this--
MI. O'Connor.
MI. O'Connor.
What were you doing in that closet?
I like it in there.
There's nothing so restful as a nice, dark, stuffy closet.
Did you say...?
MI. O'Connor?
That's what he said.
Don't start popping questions.
I haven't time.
- Where are those papers of transfer?
- Right here.
Yeah. Oh. Oh. good.
Now, then, before I transfer this barracks property...
...over to you three gentlemen...
-...there's one thing you must do for me.
- Yes, sir.
Not one word of this to McKeever.
As far as he is concerned.
I am still just a--
A panhandler.
- Gentlemen. is that clear?
- Yes. sir.
Good.
Sit down, make yourself at home.
CHATTERING, LAUGHING]
Just a minute. 'folks.
To Mike...
...I never would have believed it possible. but he certainly came through in a pinch.
- To Mike!
- To Michael J.--
- Speech. Mike. Speech.
- Come on. Mike.
Well. I-- Ahem.
I really don't know what to say...
...excepting that I'm glad
I was able to be of service...
...even though Mac here chooses to think of me...
...as a drifter, a panhandler and a man of little principle.
Water under the bridge. Mike.
Please try and forget that I ever said it.
Mac, it's already forgotten.
Well...
It's too bad we have to leave here.
But we did promise the patrolmen to be out of here by the first of the year.
Naturally, I would have preferred...
...to spend the winter as I customarily do.
But...
All good things must come to an end.
Soon the O'Connor servants will be coming back.
Taking down the boards.
Tomorrow. we must put the house in older...
...so that everything will be just as we found it.
Tonight is our last night together.
Our paths may never cross again.
And I would like to feel that you're all my friends.
For to be without friends is a serious form of poverty.
The New Year.
And may it bring happiness to all of you.
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year!
You know. I always come out the same way I go in.
Well. everything is just as we found it.
You know.
It's been a very pleasant winter alter all.
I guess Sam knows that he's going on the load.
All right, Sam. I'm ready.
Well. look. Mac. I...
Well. that is...
-...Trudy and I are gonna be married.
- Oh.
- We're gonna have plenty of room.
- Yes, we could all stay together.
Mike and I wish you'd come stay with us.
How about it, Mac?
Well. thanks.
Thanks to all of you.
But you have your own lives to lead and I...
Well. it's a little too late to! me to change.
Anyway. I have a very nice place to go to down in Virginia.
It's near Bubbling Springs. place.
When he comes back here.
I go down there.
Oh.
Well, we better not all leave at once.
Jim and Trudy. you go out first.
- Goodbye, Mr. McKeever.
- Goodbye, dear.
I hope you'll be very happy.
Thank you.
Mac.
- I'll always remember you. Good luck.
- Oh.
Good luck to both of you too.
My. they're a nice couple.
Oh, by golly, I nearly forgot.
In case you've no place to spend your honeymoon...
...here's the key to the Guggenhoff mansion.
- They're in Europe.
- Thanks.
And. Mary. it Mike doesn't treat you right. you come back and report to me.
I'll be back here next November 3rd.
That's a date.
Mike.
Mac.
Thanks.
Goodbye. Mary.
Come on. Sam. Attaboy.
Fifth Avenue. This street where the original 400 built their homes...
...making it the most celebrated residential avenue in the world.
That magnificent marble dwelling we are just passing is the Guggenhoff mansion.
Bye.
- He was the copper king.
- Bye.
On your light. that big brownstone mansion that's all boarded up...
...that is the townhouse oi the great industrial wizard...
...Michael J. O'Connor. the second-richest man in the world.
- You know, Mary.
- Yes, Mike.
There are richer men than I.
- Mary.
- Yes, Mike.
Remind me to nail up the board in the back fence.
He's coming through the front door next winter.
Wait for me.
I'll only be a minute.
- I can't wait.
- Sure you can. I do that all the time.
I don't care what you do all the time, mister.
It ain't right to hold a cab these days.
There used to be 11,811 cabs operating in New York City.
- Now there's less than 10,000.
- Okay, you won the case.
Right now every New York cab has to take care of 1,156 people, and that's a lot-
I said you won the case. Do you have to convert me too? Here. Keep it.
- Hello, Mr. O'Mara.
- Evening, honeybunch.
- Hello, pet.
I told you I had a date for dinner.
Anybody want a cup of coffee?
No, thanks.
But I'd like some cream.
- Uh-uh, Angelus.
- I'll definitely start my diet-
Tomorrow. I know.
Well, anyway, you finished my upper part.
And don't forget.
This is the only place I ever eat.
When are you going to let me come live with you, Daisy?
When you reduce your suitor traffic.
Here's the cream, honeybunch.
- All right, darling. Get up and live.
- Thank you.
That's the last of the Eberhardt series.
It's half past time
I got dressed for dinner.
Don't girls ever die in bed in your magazines?
Sure-suffocation, but I don't like it.
With a pillow over my face,
I look like anybody.
How about Monday at 9:00?
We start on the Fuller job.
Swell. See you Monday.
- Have a good time, honeybunch.
- Good night, Mr. O'Mara.
- Good night, Angelus.
- Good night, Daisy.
- I've got to get dressed.
- I can't stay, pet.
I tried to call you all afternoon, but your line was busy.
- I can't make dinner at the Latimers' tomorrow.
- Oh, honestly. Do you realize... this is the third time we've made a date with the Latimers and you've broken it?
- Honey, if you let me talk l-
- Why should I?
I don't intend to believe a word you're going to say.
Once, yes.
But three times in a row.
Make it the week after next, and I'll be there if it kills me.
I will not. You don't have to go anywhere with me.
We just won't plan anything at all.
Come on, Tubby.
Sure you don't want some coffee?
No, thank you.
I don't want any coffee.
Going to rain.
Oh, fine.
Let's make conversation.
Do you think there'll be rain for the entire eastern seaboard this weekend?
I hope not. I'm going to Washington.
Hard enough to get a taxi when it isn't raining.
Washington? How thrilling.
Harry S. Want your advice on atomic energy?
Now, look. Your being mad is silly, and you know it.
I've never broken a date unless I couldn't help it.
Unless something really important-
- Thanks.
- I don't mean you're not important.
But we can go to the Latimers' next week, and we can see each other anytime.
Do you realize in all this time, ever since the Latimers first introduced us... that we haven't made a single other mutual friend?
Those stairs of yours are driving me nuts.
Why don't you live someplace civilized?
That apartment on 63rd Street-
I can't hold it forever.
You're determined to have a good row, aren't you?
This is my apartment. It's been my apartment since I started to work in New York.
I like it, and I'm keeping it.
You're making plenty of money yourself.
I have a theory that you stay in this hovel just to punish me.
- And another thing-
- I don't think we have time for a single other thing.
I think we won't see each other anymore, Dan.
I think I'm through.
Do we have to go through all this again?
No, we don't have to go through anything again.
I have to fight to stay happy- fight for everything.
My life's all mixed up with you every way
I turn. And what fun is it?
I've tried, and you've tried.
It isn't all your fault.
There just isn't enough.
At least for me there isn't.
You've got her, and you've got the kids.
You've got your work and being a big shot in Washington.
I've just got my work.
You messed that up too.
When I'm mad I can't work, and I'm mad all the time.
You're never going to marry me, because you're never going to be divorced for all you say.
- That's not fair-
- You're never going to be divorced, Dan, because you don't want to be.
Believe me, I'm not being sorry for myself.
I knew it would be like this.
It's just that I'm tired.
That's all. Tired and through.
I'll get out whenever you tell me to... but I want you to tell me because you mean it, not because you're angry.
Are you really telling me now?
- I said I was.
- You know I don't like scenes.
I'll get out now, and I won't come back, if you tell me.
Darling.
Will you ever believe
I mean what I say?
That depends on what you say.
I was taking a client of mine out to dinner tonight- Payton Ames, the novelist.
I'll call him up and tell him to forget it.
I told you I had a date for dinner... and you needn't think that getting around me is going to change my mind.
You're most of my life, Daisy- the only part of it that matters.
- We can't stop.
- I've tried.
Honestly, I've tried.
And I will one day too.
All right, you will.
You stop sometime, maybe next year, next week... but not this week.
All right. Not this week.
Now go on. Beat it.
My date's due.
Good night.
Good night, Dan.
Taxi!
- Wait for me.
- Hey, taxi!
Sorry, I'm keeping him.
Isn't right to hold a cab these days.
Every New York cab has to do for 1,156 people.
Anyway, Miss Kenyon won't be ready.
Oh, she's expecting you, but I'm afraid
I delayed her a little bit.
Go right up. I'll send the cab back when I'm through with it.
He ain't paid.
That's okay. I'll take care of that and double the rest.
- 8883 Park. Just get going.
- Okay.
- Hello, Miss Kenyon.
- Hello.
- Am I too early?
- No, I'm a very sloppy gal and never on time.
- A friend dropped in, and I couldn't start changing.
- That's all right.
I've got a whole week before I report back, so take your time.
Come on in and mix yourself a drink, will you?
Right there.
I won't be too long.
Well, hello, beautiful.
How do you do? Yes.
- You still here?
- I should say.
Everything seems to go wrong when you're in a hurry. You know how it is.
Ah, it's all right.
We've become very close friends.
- You like Tubby?
- Ah, he's a beauty.
I think it's stopped raining.
Would you like the Brevoort for dinner?
I haven't been there since before the war.
I'd love it.
Where are your ribbons?
Oh, I must've left them at the cleaners.
You must've been worse off at that party last night than you thought you were.
I'm always worse off than I think I am.
Don't you remember giving these to me?
I always give them away when I find somebody who will listen to me.
Why did you ask me 400 times last night if I were real?
Why not?
Nothing else here is real.
When I came back from Europe the first time after V-E Day... they changed Sixth Avenue into something called "Avenue of the Americas."
It wasn't New York.
It wasn't home.
That's why I went back to Germany with the Army of Occupation.
Hmm. Germany, where nothing was changed, of course.
You going to be in the army all your life?
I'd intended to, until I met you.
- Miss Angelus tells me you're a yacht designer.
- Used to be.
I remember now. You designed the Lapham Six Meter.
There were beautiful photographs of boats in the magazines by a Susy Lapham.
- Was that someone in your family?
- My wife.
Say, what is it with you guys?
Don't any of you ever go back to the wives you left when you went to war?
- Excuse me.
- Hello?
- Your cab, lady.
I took that party up to Park.
He said to come back, you'd be waiting.
Be down in a minute.
Seems my friend sent his cab back for us.
They're hard to get in the rain.
He must've been lucky.
He was. He took mine.
Sure, let's go.
He can be very rude at times.
He was, I suppose.
I didn't notice.
We were talking about your wife.
You were, yes.
She's dead.
Okay, honeybunch.
Well, don't you worry. If they get you,
I promise to visit you in Leavenworth... with flowers.
- Good night.
- Danny, darling.
The office telephoned again.
There just isn't a drawing room on that train.
They tried and tried.
You wanted it to work in, didn't you?
What did you think I wanted it for?
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.
Mervyn!
Dan, he's right behind you.
- Yes, sir?
- Mervyn, it's the 12:30 I'm taking.
Bring my bag and my briefcase down to Penn Station and meet me at the track gate.
- Yes, sir.
- Dan, you work too hard. You know you do.
Even Father thinks so.
- Well, you never get a decent vacation.
- Mr. Harris.
- You're stuck here all summer.
Half the time, no weekend.
- I don't see how you do it. One of these times-
- Hello, Harris. Lucille, please.
Look, honeybunch, I'm home, and I'm relaxing, so call me in Washington, will you?
Right. So long.
Dan, what are you going to Washington for anyway?
Officially I'm going down to present a brief to S.E.C. On Amalgamated Gas.
- But while I'm there-
- I could never remember that. Never mind.
I don't know what you're doing, but no one expects me to anymore, so it doesn't matter.
You think I know what I'm doing, baby?
- Where are the girls?
- Rosamund's primping. She's terribly excited.
Danny, I do wish you'd consulted me before you told her she could go with us tonight.
Thirteen's no age for the Stork Club.
- What's the harm in it? Where's Marie?
- She's doing her homework.
She's getting awfully independent too, Dan.
I don't know what-
Well, how do you like?
Fifty million dollars, honey.
Rosamund, if you don't take off some of that lipstick, you're not going with us.
- I've told you twice now.
- Dan, do you think it's too much?
Of course it is, but it's very attractive.
Rosamund, you heard me.
Mommy, I'm not that young.
You forget my name's O'Mara... and there's a life of interesting crime ahead of me.
You're very mean to your mother.
You shouldn't be. She's sweet.
You laughed, Dan.
Daddy, where are we going tonight?
- Dinner at the Colony, then the Stork Club.
Is that all right?
- Terrific.
- Marie!
- Right to your room. To your room this instant!
- What's going on?
- Daddy!
- What is it, baby?
Marie has been insolent.
I told her to stay in her room...
- because she has two hours of homework to do, but she-
- What is it?
She hit me.
She hit me.
But she said things.
I've never been spoken to like that in my life...
- and by my own child, l-
- Couldn't be that bad, baby.
I've got worse from my old man for nothing but sniffling when I didn't have a handkerchief.
- I think you've been very rude to your mother.
- But she called me-
That's one of the very worst things you could do, talking to your mother like that.
- But, Dan, you don't unders-
- Lucille, would you straighten up those flowers, please?
- That's the fourth commandment, baby.
You mustn't be rude to your parents.
The fourth.
That's how important it is.
It's up ahead of murder and stealing.
What was it you wanted anyway?
I just- I just wanted to stay up while you had cocktails and see everybody.
I read Mr. Ames's book, and I wanted to meet him.
I don't see any reason why you shouldn't meet him.
Lucille, I'm sure she'll do her best to get her homework finished tomorrow.
All that has nothing to do with the way she spoke to me. And look at her.
- Look at yourself, darling.
Don't know what
I'm going to do with you.
Here we are with guests arriving and-
- That's better. I'll see to the guests.
- Thank you.
Now say you're sorry and go wash you're face.
I'm sorry.
Thank you, Dan.
Don't ever hit that child again, Lucille.
How can you have so little control as to let an 11 -year-old child-
Control? It's easy for you.
You see them five minutes a day-
Just enough to spoil them.
- Well, if you could understand how thankless it is for me-
- Now, Lucille... a half an hour of hero worship is not going to hurt Marie.
And how do you know what hurts her- what hurts anybody?
I realize what I am to you.
All right.
Only don't interfere when I try to make better human beings of my daughters.
- Now, Lucille, dear-
- No, for once I'm going to say it!
I know exactly what I am to you, and sometimes I wish I didn't know.
Know what? You just lost your temper with Marie, and now you're losing it with me.
I don't get mad easily, and I don't want to now.
Maybe I haven't been the best husband, but if you want me to stay any kind of husband at all... you'll never say anything again like what you tried to say just now.
You say you know exactly what you are to me.
Well, if you do know, you know the good things as well as the bad.
You'll never have any less, unless you ask for it.
And you know it isn't thankless.
We have two fine girls, and you're to be thanked for that.
Now go powder your nose.
Lucille, honey, go on.
Daddy. Daddy, I'm so humiliated.
I asked Mr. Ames to autograph his novel for me, and we haven't a copy in the house.
Well, I'll tell you what you do.
You go out and buy a copy tomorrow, and I'll get it autographed for you.
And next time, don't talk so big, huh?
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Excuse us, please.
If this is the way they do things in your country,
I'm going back where I came from.
In an hour or two, we'll work our way to a table.
Where would you go back to?
Brittany.
Rennes, the capital.
I was in the lead tanks when we took the place.
I never felt so welcome anywhere in my life.
For three days, I listened to the bells of Rennes, and there wasn't anything... in the whole world except the bells of Rennes.
Jack?
- I need to kiss your neck.
- No, you don't need to kiss my neck.
You just keep on talking.
Would you like to get out of here and go someplace else? I wouldn't.
I like it here.
I like it fine here with you.
- Where are we anyway?
- This is the Stork Club.
And this is America.
You're welcome here too.
Yeah.
I do kind of feel welcome.
Next best thing to going to Rennes and letting the bells support me.
That reminds me. What am I gonna do for a living when I get out?
Well, there are a lot of beautiful sloops waiting to be designed, I understand.
Ah, kid stuff.
I think I'm going to be a ruthless tycoon from now on.
I need a drink, and you, Daisy, need a drink.
You're very nice.
You're especially nice when you need a drink.
Rosamund, this is an historic occasion.
First time at the Stork. Come in here.
That's awfully nice, Dan, really.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.
- No check necessary.
- Thank you, honeybunch.
- Hello, Walter.
- Hello, O'Mara. How are you?
- Your hat, Mr. Winchell.
- This is my little daughter Rosamund.
Her first night here.
- Hello.
- You know Lucille.
- Have a good time.
- Thank you. Come right in, dear.
- Lucille.
- Good evening, Mr. O'Mara.
Evening, honeybunch. I'm depending upon you to impress my daughter... with the very best table in the house.
Oh, hello, Leonard.
Going to Washington tonight.
- If you call me tomorrow, I might give you a story.
- Thanks, O'Mara.
Just for that, I'll let you handle my libel business.
Uh, the lady in the corner there with the man in uniform-
- All right, Mr. O'Mara.
- Thank you.
I have a table for you now.
I'm sorry, but we just remembered a long-distance call we put in and then forgot.
To Rennes.
Night, honeybunch.
I had a lovely time.
Did you know it was half past 3:00?
I had a lovely time too.
No, I didn't know it was half past 3:00.
- Will you call me again soon?
- Sure.
Oh, really.
I'm not just being polite.
I wouldn't say this if it weren't half past 3:00... but don't ask me to call if you don't mean it.
I have to work tomorrow, so don't call me till Sunday.
If you're sober by Sunday afternoon, you can take me to a baseball game.
Will you call me Sunday morning?
- I love you.
- You-What?
When you hear the tone, the time will be 12:52.
When you hear the tone, Daisy Kenyon will have been stood up for the first time in her life.
- Hello?
- Miss Daisy Kenyon?
- Yes.
Washington is calling.
Go ahead, Washington.
Hello? Hello, baby.
How are you?
Hello, Dan. I'm fine, thanks.
Having a good time?
Terrible.
I miss you, baby.
- How's your boyfriend?
Oh, you know, the fella you went out with the other night.
I stole his taxi, but I sent it back.
Did you get it all right?
Don't try to bluff your way out of that.
I was furious, and I still am.
And that table at the Stork Club.
Really, you behaved like a-
I behaved like a cad, huh?
Are you gonna leave me for him?
I'm going to leave you, all right, but not for Mr. Lapham.
He's nice, but a little unstable.
Oh, really?
He's got an interesting face.
Oh, baby, I just looked at my watch.
I'm 40 minutes late for a lunch.
Big, preposterous lunch out at Chevy Chase.
It'll be over by the time I get there.
Better finish my coffee and get out of here.
I'll take the 2:00 train, maybe the 3:00.
- Do you wanna meet me at Penn Station?
Come in.
- Mr. O'Mara?
- That's right. Will you meet me at the station?
And sit around wondering which train you took?
- Who just came in?
- A gentleman I never saw before in all my life... who doesn't know I'm already
40 minutes late for lunch.
- Sweetie, meet me at The Savarin.
- No, I don't think so.
Oh, come on. Give. Don't make me beat you down every time. I love you.
I love you too, I guess.
- Good. I'll see you there. Good-bye, dear.
- Bye.
I'm Will Thompson, attorney for the Civil Rights Association.
This is the kind of pressure stunt
I don't go for, Thompson.
I have an office in New York.
I've been trying to reach you for weeks.
I want you to work on a case, Mr. O'Mara.
I represent Suyo Noguchi.
The armyjudge advocate tells me that he spoke to you about the case.
Oh, yes.
Well, I couldn't have been very interested, because I don't remember anything he said.
Noguchi is a niseiJapanese.
Fought in Italy.
Wounded, decorated.
Came home to find his farm legally stolen.
That's not my kind of case.
There are over 50 million victims of this war.
It isn't anybody's kind of case.
It's an unpleasant, thoroughly thankless kind of case, O'Mara.
But it's representative of almost every nisei who fought in Europe.
I used to feel a sort of pleasant dignity... knowing that I could always be called upon to protect a democratic idea.
I'm a tired and angry man now,
Mr. O'Mara... but you're an unspent and very wealthy man.
Maybe you could use some of that sort of pleasure.
Come along and ride with me.
- Hello, baby.
- Hi, cad.
- You have a nice Sunday?
- Oh, lovely.
Did you ever try making one martini last an hour?
Maybe it would've been easier if you'd drunk it.
I'm glad you're here, baby.
I need your advice.
You what?
I've just taken a case that's gonna make you feel you've had a salutary effect on me.
If you took a case like that, it must be on page one of the newspapers.
Ah, you're very ungracious. I took it because it's gonna make you love me like mad.
- Do you want my advice, or do you wanna brag?
- Both.
I wanna know how I'm gonna break this to my wife's old man.
- My law partner, you know.
- Mm-hmm.
He's gonna have a stroke when he finds out we've taken a case... with no fee, no publicity and representing a Japanese.
It's a case of a veteran,
Suyo Noguchi.
He fought in Italy with the Fourth Division.
He comes home with a Purple Heart,
Silver Star, and he was discharged.
Only there wasn't any home to come to.
Some smart operator out on the coast digs up a law written by Cortés... and moves his farm right out from under him.
Well?
Love me like mad?
Mm-hmm.
I love you like mad.
- Then why don't you kiss me?
- All right, I will.
- I'm starved. Where are we going for dinner?
- Oh, honey, we aren't.
I've got to see my wife's old man about this and a couple of other things.
Which reminds me.
There's some other advice I want from you.
Seriously, Daisy, Marie worries me.
Lucille doesn't seem to know how to handle her.
What would you think of boarding school for a year?
Dan, how do you expect me to answer a question like that?
By the way, you didn't tell me that Rosamund was getting so tall. Lucille looked very well.
You sound jealous.
Didn't it ever occur to you that I have more reason to be jealous than Lucille has?
Here we are having a perfect time-
What the devil are you looking for in that purse?
A nickel.
Have you got one?
- Yes.
- Thank you.
Honey, what's the matter?
- Oh, Angelus? Daisy.
- Hi.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing much.
Good. I'll meet you at my apartment in 15 minutes.
We'll throw some sort of dinner together, then the movies, okay?
Daisy, listen. I don't have to leave for half an hour, an hour. Please don't get mad again.
There was some picture
I wanted to see at the Greenwich.
I love you, Daisy, and you love me. Why can't you let us be happy for one minute together?
Dan, I've had a bad day.
I've been walking around all afternoon... three blocks north, three blocks south, south by north.
I can't wander all my life.
I've got to be going somewhere.
Can't you understand that?
Even if it's to the movies.
Angelus, I'll see you in 15 minutes.
You cook like you paint, honey-
Fast, colorful and glib.
I'll call the theater and see what time the picture goes on.
You'd make some selfish goon a much better wife than he deserves, is all I can say.
That's all I can say too.
Greenwich. Greenwich.
- Hello?
- Miss Kenyon?
- Yes.
Hello. How are you?
This is Pete Lapham.
- Hello?
- I'm very well, thank you.
That's good. I just happened to be in your part of town. I don't suppose I could come by?
I'm sorry, but you caught me as I was on my way out.
I have a cab waiting downstairs and a whole gang of people.
- You have?
- Yes, I have.
We're on our way to a ball game, and we're very, very, very late.
- Please, can't I come up?
- I'm afraid you can't.
Tomorrow or any other day?
No, not tomorrow or any other day.
Well, what time does the picture go on?
Oh, how stupid of me. I'm sorry.
Somebody called, and I forgot all about it.
Thank you.
- Yes, sir?
- Uh, scotch and soda, please.
This isn't a bar. It's a restaurant, or haven't you noticed?
Well, in that case, bring me a steak sandwich and a glass of milk.
Who's in there, buddy?
Your wife?
I can give you the name of a guy who works very cheap and save you all this trouble.
If I had a wife, it's when she wasn't at the movies I'd worry, not when she was.
Steak sandwich and a glass of milk.
Door downstairs was open.
Yes?
I did something bad.
Yes, I guess you did.
You'd better tell me. It had something to do with the ball game, didn't it?
Well, you were supposed to call me this morning and take me out this afternoon. That's all.
- Except that I didn't.
- Except that you didn't.
I've been shot twice for a good deal less than that.
I forgot.
Look, it's late. I'm afraid you'd better run along.
Can I come back again sometime?
L- I don't know.
You-You mix up everything.
You don't sound mixed up.
You sound composed, certain.
- No, don't, Pete.
- I'm going.
I just want to hold you for a minute.
The world's dead, and everybody in it's dead but you.
How did they come to die?
Daisy, have you-
Did you ever let yourself get into a mood you couldn't find a way out of?
What's the matter?
My wife was killed in an accident.
Driving a car down from Truro on the cape five years ago.
That started it- a kind of slow dying.
I fought against it, but it happened anyway.
The war did the rest.
That's foolish, and I think you know it.
Yes. Two times I was wounded,
I wanted like anything to live.
But when I got well, it started again.
That's why I didn't get out of the army after Europe.
With Susy gone
I didn't want to see any of my friends... or go back to anything
I'd ever done before.
That was bad, wasn't it?
But I don't believe a word of it.
Oh, I believe the facts, all right... but not the melodrama.
If everything had gone dead for you, you wouldn't know it.
You wouldn't be sitting here trying to sound like a case history.
And you know all about case histories, don't you?
All right, have your tragedy, have your melodrama. Go on.
You're using me, sort of.
Yes. Aren't you using me?
We can talk about me but not about you?
I'm not interesting.
There's no melodrama in my life.
You're in love with a ruthless tycoon.
Isn't that melodrama?
It isn't like that at all.
You don't know.
Do you love him?
Yes, I do love him.
But it isn't enough, or I wouldn't be here, would I?
Would you like some milk?
Gosh, no. I drank two gallons waiting for you to come out of that movie.
In all the case histories I've read, it seems a good idea to get a job... find other things to think about.
The whole thing'll go a month after we're married.
Married?
You're a south-by-north character if there ever was one.
Y-You're exactly what I don't need.
You know you're very tender about being proposed to?
Will you marry me?
I love you, and I want to marry you.
Please say yes.
Please? Come and meet my sister and brother-in-law in Scarsdale... and receive a letter from my aunt in Cambridge.
Please?
Come live with me and be my love.
Or better still, let me come here and live with you.
Please marry me.
Darling Daisy.
Lovely Daisy.
You have such nice ears, Daisy.
Let's- Let's start all over again.
There's a-There's a baseball game
Wednesday night.
If I'm not here Wednesday at 7:00,
I won't bother to call again.
- Good night, Miss Kenyon.
- Good night.
- Hello, Mr. O'Mara. How's California?
- Hello, honeybunch.
- Mr. O'Mara. Good to have you back.
- Hello, Frances. How are you?
- Hiya, Jack.
- Hello, Mr. O'Mara.
- Hello, darlings!
- Hi. We'd given you up for lost.
Fancy meeting you here, Dan O'Mara.
Marsha, first things first.
Get me Chelsea 2-0459.
- Nine.
- Where's Coverly and Coverly?
One foot in the grave, the other on my neck.
Can't I go away for 18 days without him bothering us?
- Oh, hello, sugarplum.
Have you any idea what's been going on here, Dan?
Amalgamated Gas is retaining Stevenson because we don't give them enough time.
- The S.E.C. -
- Can't I go away without you working yourself into a state?
- Doesn't that number answer?
- It's busy.
- Keep trying, Marsha.
- The S.E.C. Accuses us ofholding up the Butcher case.
How are Lucille and the kids?
Check that number and see if it's out of order.
They're fine. We're all having dinner together.
And if you want to have it a pleasant dinner, let's get our harsh words over with now.
Do we have to have harsh words, Papa?
Look, Dan, it was tough enough before you took on that ridiculous case.
When you shut yourself up for 18 days in California-
Papa, did you or I ever object when Coverly Sr.
Spent four months a year on his boat?
- Well, what's that got to do with it?
- We didn't object, did we?
A man needs his relaxation.
And I never objected when you stood up in a trout stream...
Iooking like Calvin Coolidge two months a year either, did I?
What's all this got to do with a grandstand play defending a Japanese?
If it gives me pleasure to fight some lucrative race prejudices... including your own, that's my sport.
- You understand?
- All right, Dan. Only, uh-
Who brought the S.E.C. Case in here anyway?
Amalgamated Gas and National Motors.
And why do we still have to have your papa's name on that door...
10 years after he drowned himself in the Fastnet race?
I said all right, Dan.
Okay, dewdrop.
And now that the harsh words are over, we can have a very pleasant dinner together.
But a little later.
I got a million things to do.
Would you be sweet enough to call Lucille and ask her...
- if she'll meet us at the Colony at 9:00?
- All right, Dan.
Just tell her I'm back, and I'm happy, and I'm well and that I love her.
And that you're happy and well and that you love me.
- What about that number?
- It's busy. I had the operator listen in.
The receiver must be off the hook.
There weren't any voices, but there was music.
File these with Mobile Power,
National Motors.
All the rest of that stuff is the Noguchi case.
- Shall I call that number again?
- No, never mind.
I'm gonna slip out for a few minutes and see Graybove from National Motors.
Boy, did he give it to the walking dead.
- Where'd he go now?
- Kenyon. She doesn't answer the phone.
There were a lot of wires from her he locked in his desk.
On one of them I saw just four words:
"Yes, something has happened."
You're going to marry him. Is that what you tried to warn me about in your wires?
I have married him.
I wanted to tell you to your face.
I couldn't over the telephone.
Well, this is a new twist.
The guy moves in and brings his etchings with him.
What's his connection with boats?
He designs them, or at least he did before the war.
- Now he's working as a compass adjuster.
- A what?
Well, it's just a temporary job until we can save enough money... to buy a car and a shack on the cape.
We expect to live up there most of the year.
I can get my magazine assignments here and do my work up there.
After a few months,
Peter will know what he wants to do.
That is, well, he doesn't think he wants to go back to yacht designing.
This is the Sartatia, isn't it?
Yes, Peter's father designed her.
She was a beauty.
Nice clean lines.
I used to sail her years ago with old Pop Coverly.
I didn't know you cared anything about boats, Dan.
A lot of things about me you didn't know.
And a lot that I didn't know either.
Have a good life, baby.
You deserve it.
Good-bye, Daisy.
- Bye.
Don't you want the cab, Mr. O'Mara?
If you hadn't planned to keep it.
I hadn't, although it's definitely going to rain.
- Your father designed the Sartatia, I understand.
- Yes.
There was something I was never able to figure about the Sartatia.
Oh, I used to sail her years ago.
And what amazed me was that she didn't roll to swells like other round-bottom boats.
- Didn't do what?
- She didn't roll, even in light airs.
That's the bluenose in her.
The old Gloucester hull.
- Ever see her out of the water?
- No.
All her sections carry displacement high.
This would be half a cross section here, with the waterline like that-
Giving her a slick underbody with maximum stability.
What I don't understand is, who figured out that a few planks in the hull of a ship... twisted a certain way would make her behave in a planned way.
Hundreds of years of observing seamen, logic.
It's things like this that make people like me mad.
- Why?
- Anything logical makes me want to fight for some reason.
I've always distrusted logic.
Luckily, I never ran against it in law courts very often, or anywhere else.
That's what makes life unexpectedly pleasant- the illogical.
Like this moment, for instance.
Good luck, Mr. Lapham.
I won't send the cab back this time.
Peter.
Funny thing is, I like him.
He wants you to like him.
- He's good at that.
- Poor devil.
He's not a poor devil.
Do we have to sit here, Peter?
Beginning of a new era.
Bottom of stairs-
Bottom of stairs, symbolic of starting all over again.
- Lucky we're starting one flight up.
Aren't you going to kiss me?
Yeah.
I'm gonna kiss you like nobody was ever kissed... even before you wash your face.
Were you ever carried over your own threshold before?
Not sober, darling.
You're still driving a Sherman tank.
We should've got here in time to meet the boat.
Does that look like enough lumber to build a whole bathroom?
- Half bath. That's what we ordered.
- Hey! Peter Lapham!
- Dino!
- Glad to see you, Pete.
Good to see you, Dino.
- Five years haven't changed you any.
How's the fishin'?
- Oh, terrible.
And this is not kidding-The years, they left you lookin' pretty good too.
And Mrs. Lapham, she still looks very pretty.
Well, I'm another Mrs. Lapham, but I'm glad to meet you anyway.
Oh. Glad to meet you, ma'am.
Well, you are back in
Provincetown now, Pete.
Are you gonna build some more of them pretty boats for the summer people?
I don't know.
I just got here.
We bought a cottage up on Mill Road.
First thing I'm gonna build is it.
- The same cottage you sold before?
- No.
Hey, Pete, I got a proposition.
Look at my boat.
Why don't you build me a new baby?
Good, strong Banks schooner.
Modern. You know, streamlined.
You make her good, and the fishermen will order hundreds of them for the whole coast... and this is not kidding.
I don't know. I'm not sure what I'm gonna do.
When are you gonna pull her out of the water?
- Monday.
- I'll come down, take a look at her hull.
See if I get an idea.
- Great! And this is not kidding?
- This is not kidding.
- So long, Dino.
- So long.
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.
- So long, Mrs. Lapham.
- Good-bye, Dino.
Susy and I had a cottage two miles up
Mill Road from where we are.
- I didn't tell you because-
- You didn't have to tell me. I knew it anyway.
She isn't out of your life yet, is she?
Of course she is.
I loved her. I lost her.
I don't think it's as easy as that.
Don't ever expect one person to replace another one, Peter.
You might be disappointed.
You sure you're talking about me?
Not entirely, no.
You lost something in Susy, and I lost something in Dan.
We've no right to expect the same things in each other.
It's no good thinking about what we've lost.
It's a lot more fun to find out what we've gained.
I love you, Kenyon.
- This is not kidding?
- This is not kidding.
Great. Look who you married- the son of Dracula.
Don't cover it up now. Get at it.
What was it, Peter?
How do I know?
Susy, Panzerlehrdivision of the Schutzstaffel and a Welsh rarebit.
But most of all, Susy.
If you say so, Doctor, although I don't see how you know.
I've had to work to get
Dan out of my system.
I've done it too.
Now you've got to work.
When did you write this to Susy?
The night she died.
I'd forgotten about it.
You go through my papers often, sweetheart?
It was in the common property drawer- almost as if you wanted me to see it.
I'm glad I did.
"The winds of earth are old and sane.
"But tell me- tell me when you know... what happens to a hurricane that hasn't any place to go."
That was self-pity.
The whole nightmare was that.
Daisy, do you know you've never told me you love me?
No, don't say it now.
I like you for not saying it.
Let it grow.
Let it grow until loving me means loving the earth... and all that's sweet and green and mellow and exciting on the face of the earth... and the face of the ocean.
Let it grow.
Let it grow.
- Peter.
- Yes?
I love you.
Say it again.
Put my name on the end of it.
I love you, Peter Lapham.
Now you know what happened to that hurricane that hadn't any place to go.
Yes, now I know.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Guess what?
- What?
I've hit the big time.
The office called... and they want me for a serial in the Thursday review.
I've got to go to New York tomorrow.
Oh, honey, I'd go with you.
I don't know what to do about Dino.
- I promised him I'd finish rigging tomorrow.
- Well, that's all right.
I've wired Angelus.
She'll have to share our apartment with me.
Oh, that came from Dan.
She forwarded it from New York.
I'd say poor Dan, only I'm sure he loves it.
- 32 West 12th.
- All right.
- Here you go.
- Thank you, sir.
Hey, since when do you go south for Park?
You said 12th Street, Mac.
Did I?
Take me there then.
Wait here.
- Are you alone?
- Angelus lives here. Mary Angelus.
Peter and I share the apartment with her.
We're away most of the time.
I know. I called a couple of times.
I need to talk to you.
- Take me to lunch tomorrow, will you?
- Baby, I need to see you now.
I just got off the plane from California.
I hadn't intended coming here.
I gave the driver this address without thinking... because you're the only person in the world
I wanted to see just now.
- You haven't any right to need anything from me.
I haven't anything to give you.
I'm sorry, Daisy.
I'm tired.
I just had some trouble.
Not family.
Not personal that way.
Just something I cared about that blew up.
- You remember the Noguchi case?
- Yes, I remember.
We got beaten.
Noguchi lost his property.
Well, haven't you ever lost a case before?
I don't feel that
I ever had a case before.
I'm still surprised.
I can't get used to it.
- Why is it so bad?
- Well, I don't know.
Maybe it's because it got mixed up in my mind with you. The two lickings together-
Dan, I asked you not to come in.
I don't like seeing you this way.
I thought we were good friends.
I have thought of you many times, but when you come in like this, I just-
I'm glad you thought of me when you were happy without me.
Have you been happy, baby?
Yes, terribly happy.
Happier than I ever made you?
That's a very stupid question.
You never used to be stupid.
You sound clinical.
This is something new.
I thought it was about time I began to run my life with some intelligence.
Maybe that's what sounds new.
I asked you to leave, Dan.
What right have you got to come in here... and act like a dog in the manger after the horse has been stolen?
- What are you laughing about?
Marriage hasn't stopped you from mixing your metaphors.
- Can I pour you a cup, baby?
- No, thank you.
I don't live here.
It isn't my coffee.
You know you're being very rude to me?
I liked you much better the way you used to be.
Now you're all head, like a nurse in a mental hospital.
I think it's a pose, and I wish you'd cut it out, and sound like Daisy Kenyon.
That's more like you.
I ought to be sorry I did that.
I could've hurt you.
Hurt an O'Mara with a stamp box?
The O'Maras, I'll have you know, have survived steins, dornicks and bricks.
Shall I tell you what went on between you and Peter this summer?
You convinced yourselves that you loved each other.
That was easy.
You're both nice people.
So, logically, there was no reason why you shouldn't love each other.
You think you know everything, don't you?
Sure. I know all about everything.
What good does it do me?
Can't even win a simple case.
I don't feel sorry for you, Dan.
Of course you got beaten.
That's not so awful.
Most people get licked every day.
Who told you you were special?
The one time in your life you thought about somebody else you lost. Well, that's too bad.
But if you're really trying to do something... that will change things for people, you've got to be humble.
Don't tell me to be humble.
I'm so far down right now.
That's not being humble.
That's being sorry for yourself.
I liked you better before. You had friendship in you then that met mine at the door.
Let me go, Dan.
Let me go-
Ooh!
Now get out and take your ugly friendship with you!
- If it's ugly, you made it that.
Oh!
I'll never forgive you. Never.
Daisy, please let me talk to you. Please.
- Good evening, Mr. O'Mara.
- Good evening, Mervyn.
- Your bags, sir?
- In the hall.
Dan! We've been waiting!
- Sweetheart, what's the matter?
- Nothing, baby.
Daddy, they beat you.
Oh, Daddy.
Beat me?
Yes, honey, they did.
You've lost the case?
Is that all it is?
It isn't all.
He looks ill.
- Let me get you Dr. Riemer.
- I'm not ill, Lucy, just tired.
- Oh, are you sure, dear?
- I'm positive.
Now if you'll excuse me.
I'll see you in the morning, honey.
- Daddy, can-
- Marie. No, dear.
They beat him.
They nearly killed him.
He joked in his letter, but they nearly killed him.
Nonsense, Marie.
Daddy lost the case. That's all.
The case happened to mean a lot to him.
Now, children, go to bed, please.
It's half an hour past your bedtime, Marie.
You have homework to do,
Rosamund. I know.
Come on, Olive Oyl.
He's all right, just tired.
The case was a lot more serious with him than we understood.
I've seen men affected this way before.
A hobby takes more out of you than your regular work, like Pop and his boat.
That's the first time in 10 years he's called me Lucy.
Oh, maybe I'm being crazy, but please stay here tonight.
He's never been this way before.
He locked himself in the study and he-
- He keeps his militia revolver in there.
- Now, Lucille, really.
Don't go. Please!
Hello. Is this Chelsea 2-0459?
I want Mrs. Peter Lapham.
- Hello?
- What is it?
Daisy. Daisy, will you listen to me a minute?
Don't hang up.
Just listen.
- Daisy, are you still there?
- Yes, I'm still here.
- What is it you want now?
- I want to tell you-
I don't know how all that happened, but it wasn't you, and it wasn't me.
Daisy, darling, don't let it end like this.
It didn't end tonight. It ended a long time ago.
- You make me so ashamed of both of us.
- I know.
Daisy, look.
I had to call you.
This is the worst night of my life.
I had to tell you...
I love you.
And I like you, and I always will.
You're the only thing in my life that matters.
So what am I supposed to do about it?
Shall I say to Peter,
"Dan O'Mara's still my best friend...
"even though he betrayed everything I thought about him?
We mustn't hold that against him."
Shall I sit down and write that to Peter?
Oh, no. Oh, no, Mrs. Lapham, or should I say Daisy?
Don't you bother to write your husband.
It's none of his business, is it?
We have a lot in common,
Mr. Lapham and I.
- Lucille!
He ought to know this thing's going to go on forever.
- He ought to know you're the only person that matters to Dan!
You're standing there, thinking I'll calm down.
If you get me started talking,
I'll calm down.
- Well, you're wrong.
For a long time, I didn't think you were worth killing, but you are.
Daddy.
It's all right, baby. It's all right.
That was just talk.
You better go to bed, dear.
Take something to help you sleep.
I'm going to divorce him.
I can't take this any longer.
I don't think you realize what a bitter thing divorce is.
You'll only be torturing the children and yourself.
Go to bed, dear. You'll be able to think about it more calmly in the morning.
After all, you don't break up a marriage just on the evidence of a telephone conversation.
He says I treat the children as if they were babies.
All right, I won't anymore.
They're grown-up enough to learn what kind of a father they've got.
You couldn't sleep either?
I don't see how I missed you.
I covered both waterfronts.
Don't go in yet.
Your friend Mary's seen enough of me for one night.
Daisy, I think I'm humble now.
I wasn't before, but I am now.
I haven't started to straighten out the mess at home yet.
I had to have a look at you first.
- Dan, don't-
- Just a look.
I couldn't go on thinking of you with that expression in your eyes.
Oh.
I didn't know if you were coming back.
I didn't know you were going to stay.
Lucille thought it would be better if I did the talking for her.
As what? Her father or her lawyer?
A little of both. She wants a divorce, and I can't talk her out of it.
The only question is, what kind?
The best that money can buy,
I guess.
Lucille's quite bitter at the moment.
Perhaps you can understand that.
She wants to divorce you in New York and name Mrs. Lapham.
- And what do you think?
- I might be able to persuade her to do it the easier way... if you'd cooperate about the children.
And what is her idea of cooperation about the children?
Sole and absolute custody.
Of course, eventually, you'd be able to see them when they're a little more grown-up.
But Lucille thinks there should be a clean break now till they're adjusted to it.
Perhaps you can understand that.
Till she's sold them on the idea that I've run out on them.
Well, come now, Papa. Let's talk sense.
Lucille knows I'd never go for anything like that.
Then we file the suit.
There's no other choice, Dan.
You can think about it for a couple of days and let me know.
- Well, thanks. I'll phone you.
- Oh, I'll be in the office.
But I won't.
I'm pulling out of the firm, sugarplum.
Perhaps you can understand that.
But, Dan, there's no reason why a purely personal conflict-
Sure, there is-
Your sensitive nature.
You'd wear a smile, I know, but deep down, you'd be wincing every time we met.
Your humor's in rather bad taste.
Besides, it would give you something to occupy your time.
Without me around, you'll have to work for your income.
- This Mr. O'Mara's office?
- Yes.
- You're Mr. Lapham?
- Yes.
He's expecting you.
Go right in, please.
- Hello.
- Welcome to chaos, Mr. Lapham.
Throw me my hat, sweetheart.
- Mervyn, you understand all this is to go to the new office.
- Yes, Mr. O'Mara.
- Good-bye, darlings. I'll see you in the morning.
- Good-bye, Mr. O'Mara.
Mr. Lapham, you'll think it's strange.
I'll explain to you why I took the liberty of asking you to come here.
Hello, honey.
What are you doing here?
C-Can I see you in your office, Daddy?
A new client already.
O'Mara retained by O'Mara.
Please, Dan.
I'll be with you in a second, Mr. Lapham.
Now, what is it, sweetheart?
Rosamund was coming, too, to talk to you.
She said herself it was terribly important.
And then Millicent Harrison asked her to go to a movie.
But, anyways, it's important to me.
What is this that's so important, honey?
I'm gonna live with you. I don't care what
Rosamund does, but I'm gonna live with you.
At the club, baby?
Ladies aren't allowed there.
All right, I'll move from the club, just as soon as I can.
Then you and Ros can come and live with me.
Whenever it's all right with your mommy, that is.
It won't be all right with her.
Dan, it's awful there without you.
Why is it so awful, honey?
I was always away a lot.
You'll see me just as much, maybe even more.
When you're not there, she hates me.
Oh, no. You're wrong.
She'd never hate you.
You mustn't think because anybody's unhappy, they hate you.
We'll talk about it again, sweetheart.
You're all wrong about your mother.
- Suppose I pick you up from school tomorrow?
- I want to talk about it today.
No, tomorrow.
I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll go someplace and have tea- a regular, grown-up date, just the two of us, hmm?
- Oh, Mervyn?
- Yes, sir?
Would you take Marie and show her the new office?
- Then see that she gets home okay.
- Yes, sir.
So long, honeybunch.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'm not gonna live with her. I won't.
We'll talk about that tomorrow, baby.
I'm sorry I kept you waiting,
Mr. Lapham.
Why did you wire me, Mr. O'Mara?
Has something happened?
No, I wired you because I wanted to tell you that nothing's happened.
Well, that's clear now.
We're meeting Daisy.
I didn't tell her you were coming down.
Well, there she is already.
- Hello, honeybunch.
- Hello, Mr. O'Mara.
- Hello, Daisy.
- Hello, darling.
Hello. Would you like a drink?
Bourbon and water, please.
- One bourbon and water and two martinis.
- Yes, sir.
Do you two get together often?
Not as often as we should.
Weren't you supposed to make the trial run on Dino's boat today?
They're waiting for me to fly back tonight.
Why'd you come down?
I wired him.
I have things to say to both of you... and there's no point in saying them twice.
I wired you, Mr. Lapham...
because I think misunderstandings are childish.
- We're grown-up people.
- I believe we are.
Don't you know it?
I have a hunch that when people keep on talking about how grown-up they are... it only means they're not very sure of it,
Mr. O'Mara.
Well, if you'll let me talk, maybe you won't worry so much about that.
Let's simplify one thing at least.
He's called Peter, and you're Dan.
It all started on Wednesday.
I'd had a bad day.
I lost a case that-
Well, there's no point in going into that.
But I went over to 12th Street... and I behaved like a heel.
Your wife resisted.
I'll be frank to say if she hadn't resisted... we wouldn't all be sitting here now.
- Any questions about that?
- No, nothing important.
Why isn't it important?
Because it doesn't matter what happened.
You're not getting hostile, are you?
That wasn't on the agenda.
Honeybunch, I'm not hostile.
Honest. Go on.
I want another martini.
You haven't touched the first one yet.
Well, that's that.
If it were something that only concerned the three of us... we wouldn't need to say another word about it.
But I'm asking your permission to let me turn our private affairs into newspaper copy.
Lucille is suing me for divorce.
She wants to do it in New York, naming Daisy as corespondent.
They figure, in order to keep Daisy's name out of the newspaper...
I'll sign away the right to see my children.
Oh, no, Dan.
You mustn't.
It would be terrible for them-
Marie, especially.
I'm putting it up to you.
It's not a thing to be decided without realizing what it involves.
This is exactly the kind of copy
Sunday supplement editors are looking for.
Well, if they want a fight, we'll give it to them.
We have Mary as a witness.
I'm sure we can lick it.
I'll clear you, baby.
May I speak now, Mr. Chairman?
I suppose so.
I said it doesn't bother me, uh... what's happened recently between you and Daisy... and it doesn't matter whether you clear Daisy or don't clear her.
That nice point which is going to make so much difference to the reading public... won't mean a thing to me.
I'm not being hostile.
You see, I walked into this marriage with my eyes open.
I knew what I was up against.
It was a long shot, but I thought it was worth the chance.
- Well, wasn't it?
- I can't complain.
I pushed my way into your life, Daisy, because I needed you.
Well, I'm fine now.
Better than either of you.
- That's all there is to it.
- That isn't all there is to it.
The only reason I was able to break in was that he didn't love you enough then.
If I had met you now for the first time, would I be able to break in?
I'll do my own thinking, thank you, and my own existing.
I'm all for that.
That's why I'm leaving it up to you.
So that you can work this thing out for yourself... without being bothered by the technical drawback of a husband.
That's a formality we can dispose of any time you give the signal.
I don't want a wife on formalities.
- Peter, how can you say a thing
I didn't plan this, baby.
- You ought to know that.
- I'm almost glad it happened.
There's nothing like a crisis to show what's really inside people.
- You don't mean that.
- Don't you tell me what I mean!
Let's go.
I don't like it here.
It was close to 8:00, wasn't it?
When you returned to the apartment... and discovered Mr. O'Mara there?
- Yes.
- And you had been gone since a little after 4:00?
Yes, but it's hardly important, since his plane didn't get in till 5:30.
You testified on direct examination...
that you were surprised to see Mr. O'Mara, did you not?
You heard me.
So I did. But I found your surprise, shall I say, surprising.
You were certainly aware that the ties between Mrs. Lapham and Mr. O'Mara... were more than those of a casual acquaintanceship.
Objection, Your Honor.
Question is ambiguous... and calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness.
Objection sustained.
Let me put it this way. You had seen
Mr. O'Mara in Mrs. Lapham's apartment... on several previous occasions, had you not?
- Before she was married.
- Oh, yes, that was before she was married.
Then your surprise came from your assumption...
- that her marriage had ended their previous relationship.
- I knew it had!

- I stand corrected.
But since we must deal here with evidence, rather than opinions... could you tell exactly what concrete facts made you so positive of the change?
Well, l-
I just knew it.
That's all.
Thank you, Miss Angelus.
You are a devoted friend.
- Are you through with the witness?
- Yes, Your Honor.
Uh, no further questions,
Your Honor.
Then we'll recess till 1:00.
Hold it, please, Miss Kenyon.
- Rosamund!
- Don't blame me, Dan. It's Marie.
What's the matter with your ear?
Honey, what's the matter with your ear?
It's the cold. The minute we walked out of the house, it started bleeding.
If you're not home in half an hour, there'll be no fur jacket for Christmas.
And have Dr. Riemer look at that ear.
I had him look at it this morning.
He says it's nothing.
Did she have a blow of some kind?
No. It's purely a nervous thing.
Nothing to worry about.
- All right, Lucille.
- Thanks!
Will you see that they get home, or shall I?
I think that's up to me, don't you?
Come on, girls.
The lunchroom is a flight down.
Shall we walk?
You know, you're right. That lawyer's building a case for the papers and nothing else.
Why, Dan O'Mara.
- I'm sorry.
- I know.
You like to build, not destroy things.
I just remembered something about that ear.
When Lucille first heard about you... she took it out on the child.
She always has ever since.
I suppose she didn't mean to hit her so hard.
Oh, Daisy, forgive me for this.
Sure, baby, I forgive you.
You know, it's a common psychological phenomenon in all the northern countries... that the first snow of the year causes acute depressions.
- That must be it.
- Yes, that must be it.
Do you deny that before your marriage to Mr. Lapham... you were in constant communication with Mr. O'Mara?
- No.
- And the testimony of the real estate broker- that Mr. O'Mara rented an apartment in the east 60s.
If he did, I never lived in it.
The place I lived in was my own.
I had a good job. I still have it.
Do you want me to prove that too?
That won't be necessary.
But tell me this, Mrs. Lapham.
In the period of your, uh, constant communication with Mr. O'Mara...
you can tell the court how often you had engagements with other men.
Your Honor, I must point out again that my direct examination of Mrs. Lapham... was concerned solely with the events of the evening of last September 12.
It is my purpose to prove that the events of the past... form a very substantial background for what happened that evening.
Be that as it may, you are not entitled to establish it in this cross-examination.
You testified earlier that your marriage was a happy one.
- Was that true on September 12?
- Yes.
And on September 13?
I did not see my husband on September 13.
Isn't it true that you and your husband have not lived together... since the night of Mr. O'Mara's return from California?
Objection! I submit this whole line of questioning is irrelevant.
May I add something to that,
Your Honor?
I don't know if you have the legal right to ask such questions.
But whether you have or not, I protest them.
I protest you as a human being.
That will do, Mrs. Lapham.
The objection is overruled.
Thank you, Your Honor.
I would like to ask the witness to tell us, in her own words... just what is the present status of her marriage, and what brought it about.
Well, it-it is true that my husband and I are not living together at the present time.
But it wasn't caused by what happened that night.
At least, he said it wasn't.
Peter did- my husband-
He said it wasn't important.
- Your Honor, may I say a word?
If it is agreeable with plaintiff's counsel.
- This is his cross-examination.
- Certainly, Your Honor.
I request a recess in this trial... for the purpose of a private conference with the plaintiff.
The state is always willing to grant such a request in a divorce case.
My chambers are at your disposal.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Why did you do that?
I could've gone on.
Maybe you could, but I couldn't.
There's no need for you to wait around here.
Go home. I'll come by later.
But why did you throw in the sponge?
I learned what really matters to me while you were up there.
What really matters?
I'll give you a hint.
It has to do with how much I love you.
Jack, have Marsha find
Peter Lapham, wherever he is.
Trace him down from the cape, but find him.
I trust we all realize there's no sense in carrying on with that sideshow out there.
- Dan, l-
- Please, Lucille.
- Before there's any talk of a reconciliation, I'd like-
- Skip it, Papa.
- There's not going to be any reconciliation.
- Then we'll proceed.
For what? You haven't got a prayer on that kind of evidence.
- I think-
- Let's not waste time with what you think.
Ask someone who understands a little law.
You can go on raising the roof, I'll admit that.
But what's the point?
I'll agree to your original terms in exchange for a quiet divorce in Nevada.
You'll have the girls all to yourself, Lucy.
- Give 'em a break.
- They don't want me.
They will, if you work at it. I'll be ready to take 'em if the job gets too much for you.
Oh, Dan, it's no good.
It's no good without the two of us.
Neither of us alone is enough for them.
Oh, Dan, I've hurt you.
I've hurt the girls, and Daisy, but- but nobody as much as myself.
I'm sorry, honey.
This didn't start out as my idea.
You carry on with the details, will you, Quinn?
- Hello, Mr. Lapham.
- Mr. Lapham.
- Is the boss back from court yet?
- Yes, he got back half hour ago.
I'm so glad we found you so quickly.
He's waiting for you.
- Yes?
- Mr. Lapham is here.
Show him in.
Well, hello, Peter. I'm glad I found you in town. How long have you been here?
Some time. I'm working on plans for a diesel fishing fleet.
I called you to see if you still meant something you said at our last meeting.
- Oh, sit down, won't you?
Have a cigar or anything?
- No, thanks.
No cigar. No anything.
What did I say?
That you would be willing to bow out of your marriage anytime Daisy gave the signal.
Yes, I think that's a pretty accurate quote.
Am I being signaled?
I want to marry her.
I've taken the liberty of drawing up the necessary papers.
Naturally, Daisy doesn't want anything from you... and I assume you don't want anything from her.
Where do I sign?
You know, I'm completely baffled by you.
Well, I don't pretend to be able to explain myself in detail... but what is it that bothers you?
I was pretty sure at one time that you were in love with Daisy.
- Who said I wasn't?
- Well, here you are giving her up without a murmur.
The least you could do is punch me in the nose.
I'd be happy to, if I thought it would accomplish anything.
Suppose you give me all the arguments in favor of it, then-
Forget it. I might be too convincing.
Right here. Three copies.
Did she prefer that I sign first?
Who? Daisy?
Well, no. Not exactly.
I'm afraid I didn't make myself quite clear.
The fact is,
I haven't asked her yet.
Oh.
Well, don't you think that we ought to... go through all the formalities in their proper order?
Sure, if you think so.
Why don't we call Daisy and go see her?
Fine. Why don't we?
Trying to sneak out before I pay the rent?
I've got to get out of here.
That phone's been ringing ever since I came in.
I've got to get back to work.
That's all that matters now.
I can't figure you.
You've been in love with Dan for so long...
- and now that he's stopped the trial to save-
- I can't figure myself.
That's why I'm going away.
I don't know what I want.
It's about time I found out once and for all.
Yes?
Yes, Dan?
Peter's with you?
Oh, no. No, I'm not up to that kind of civilized nonsense.
Please, Dan, don't bring him here, and don't come yourself.
I've just got to be alone for a few days.
My work's piled up on.
Want to tell me where you're going, so I'll have something to lie about?
- To the cape.
Hello.
Oh. I'll see if she's here.
It's Lucille O'Mara, sounding 10 times worse than you.
Hang up on her, or she'll be calling you all night.
Sure, baby.
- I'll help you with that.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Can I help you with the bags, ma'am?
- No, thank you.
- Nothing else I can do?
No. No, thank you.
- Hello?
- Baby, we're here at Mills Landing.
We're on our way to face this thing out.
It's no use running away.
Don't you ever believe what I say?
I've got to be alone.
Hello, pet.
Where have you been?
It's not very smart driving around these roads on a night like this.
I'm not very smart.
Call it off?
Better, though I would have blitzed you.
I didn't hear the car come in.
I had kind of a crack-up.
- What happened, baby?
- You hurt?
No, I'm all right.
Car'll have to be towed in though.
It's about two miles down the road.
We can worry about that later.
Is there a doctor anywhere near?
Please believe me.
I'm all right.
Matter of fact, I feel a lot better than I have in weeks.
Maybe that's a good way to get clear on things.
Shock treatment.
Well, if you're sure you're all right... let's elect a chairman and get on with the meeting.
The cab is due any minute to take one of us back to the station.
Seems to me you've made a lot of plans all on your own, you two.
Well, there isn't going to be any meeting.
I know what I want.
You're both going back to New York.
And leave you here alone with nothing settled?
Baby, you've got to stop running away.
I have stopped running away.
Well, who has the floor?
- Who do you think?
- Not necessarily, honeybunch. In fact, I yield.
Well, it doesn't make very much difference who says it.
Dan's asked me to give you a divorce.
I didn't tell him to do that.
No, it's his own idea. But he apparently had reason to believe you'd go for it.
Then why did you come here, Peter?
To have you ask me for it yourself.
- I see.
That's our cab.
I'll be outside.
Daisy, we need a fresh start.
Let's go to Nassau.
Let's go someplace where we can relax.
We've been through a lot, baby... but we've never given ourselves a fair chance.
It took me a long time to realize it, but I know now what I want.
I'd give up everything for you, baby.
As a matter of fact, I practically have.
- The girls?
- It was the only way to end the thing.
You shouldn't have.
I could have gone on. I told you.
Yes, but I couldn't stand watching what they were doing to you.
Nothing was so important that I could let them tear you to pieces like that.
And in the end, it was worth it to find out what I really wanted.
Lucille would have called off the whole business...
- and gone back to where you were.
- But it was too late.
Can it ever be too late for Rosamund and Marie?
Don't you understand?
It's all over, that marriage.
It can't be over as long as the children are a part of it.
Marriage doesn't break up that easily.
It's too late.
It's even later for us, Dan.
You said it took you a long time to realize where you stood.
Me too.
But out there just now, when the car went off the road... things somehow got much clearer.
It's a funny thing about being in love.
Sometimes it's easier to tell when you are than when you aren't.
I stopped being in love with you a long time ago, Dan, but the- well, the memory kind of lingered on and kept me mixed up.
Well, whatever you call it, love or anything else... it won't be over till we're dead.
We've got to kill it, for good.
I'm sorry if I let the memory mix me up.
It mixed me up too, I guess.
I was pretty sure-
The things you put up with for my sake.
It never would have worked.
Really, darling.
Because what you called wanting me wasn't anything more than... wanting to run away from responsibility... the way you're doing now.
Good-bye, Dan.
Good-bye, Daisy.
Go ahead.
Hey, what are you doing?
Same as you, honeybunch.
Going home.
That is my house in there, you know.
And my wife.
Peter?
Yeah, that O'Mara put up a great fight.
What do you know about fighting?
When it comes to modern combat tactics... you're both babies compared to me.
A million baby kisses I'll deliver
If you will only sing the Swanee River
Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye baby
With a Dixie melody
- Julie?
- She has left, sir.
- When? Where to? Was she packed?
- Yes, sir.
- How long ago?
- About half an hour ago.
- Do you know where, Henry?
- All I know is the airport.
- New York.
- She wouldn't let me take her...
Thanks. Steve, see what you can get me on the next plane out of here.
Do it, will you?
Henry, get me some stuff in a bag.
I don't get it.
If something was on her mind, why not wait and talk?
You don't just get up and go.
It does not make sense.
And my pal Steve lets me stand out there and sing my brains out for another hour.
Why doesn't he tell me?
Haven't I got a right to know when she gets a crazy notion like this?
- Do you think it was so sudden?
- What else?
I am thinking of the questions she asked tonight.
- What questions?
- Were you happy?
Did you think of singing anymore?
I have told her a thousand times.
You told her, and tonight she heard you sing.
So what?
You saw it coming, Papa.
And Steve, everybody but me.
All right, so I sang.
The crowd was yelling, she told me to go ahead.
So I got wound up a little.
I told her, it does not mean a thing to me anymore.
I was happy this way, the way we were.
- Steve, how about it?
- Give me time, will you?
It is going to be all right, Mamma.
I hate to run away like this on your anniversary party.
If not for my party, if I did not have to see a night club...
Mamma...
Fine! Now we got tears, everything is solved.
- Congratulations, Mamma.
- Mamma, don't be silly.
Don't you see, whether we'd had the party or not...
You're all set. If you're going to make it, you better get going.
It's ready, sir.
Goodbye, Mamma.
I do not know how long I will be gone.
If I do not get back soon... anytime you want to go home,
Steve will take care of everything.
And I will see you in Washington, maybe.
Take care of yourself, Mamma.
You, too, Papa.
So long, Tom, Steve.
Wait a second,
I am driving you to the airport.
You may think you mean it, Al...
but you will never be happy
away from show business.
And someday, if I ever feel
you quit just for my sake...
if I am ever sure you want to sing,
more than you want me...
No, I am telling you, Steve, there is not a trace of her.
She got here all right, but didn't check in anyplace.
I have turned the town upside down.
She hopped in a car, I guess, and just disappeared.
Steve, I need you.
How about you coming here?
- I will be there tomorrow.
- Good, I am waiting for you.
- So long, Al.
- So long.
Maybe I don't know my own mind, but she was what I wanted.
The only thing I ever got for myself outside of show racket.
But I guess I've just been kidding myself.
Love, a girl, a couple of words
I must have picked up out of a song.
If she says so,
I've been dying to sing all the time.
All I ever wanted was a cheering mob.
I will say this about the cheering mob:
That was love, brother.
For 20 years, nobody ever walked out on me.
Okay, if she says so, I am back where I was.
Singing for a living.
And it ain't a bad feeling.
The only question now is:
How fast can I get back to work?
Tom, that script of yours
I read the other day back home, it's good.
That's the show I'd like to do, if you'll take a chance with a character like me.
- I'll consider it.
- I want to start right away.
- First thing tomorrow.
- Why not tonight?
Why don't we kick it around?
Where's the script?
- I don't walk around with it.
- Let us get it.
Why didn't I bring the one we had in California?
You mean this one?
You dog. Come to papa.
Is it true what they say about Dixie?
Does the sun really shine all the time?
Do the sweet magnolias blossom
at everybody's door?
And do folks keep eating possum
till they can't eat no more?
Is it true what they say about Swanee?
Is a dream by that stream so sublime?
Do they laugh, do they love
like they do in every song?
If it's true, that is where I belong
I said do they laugh
Do they love
like they do in every song?
That's pretty.
If it's true, that is where I belong
Al, you're on.
The bells are ringing for me and my gal
The birds are singing for me and my gal
Everybody's been knowing
to a wedding they are going
And for weeks they've been sewing
every Susie and Sal
They are congregating for me and my gal
The parson is waiting for me and my gal
And sometime, I am going to build
a little home for two
for three or four or more
In Loveland, for me and my gal
The bells are ringing for me and my gal
The birds are singing for me and my gal
And sometime, I am going to build
a little home for two
or three or four or more
In Loveland, for me and my gal
If you do not mind, that's all tonight.
What's the matter, Al?
Go on with the show.
Leave me out of the finale.
I tell you, nothing is the matter.
Just comes a night that...
How long can you go on knocking yourself out?
For what? Their $4 and their applause?
Holy smoke! Don't know what hit me.
- I never walked off like that in my life.
- What's the matter, Al?
I just can't take it anymore.
I used to live for this.
The kick is gone. It is just hard work now.
So what am I killing myself for?
What am I getting out of it?
You were always telling me, how about something for myself?
How about it? That's what I want now, some laughs, fun.
Just for me.
What happened to you?
Sit down, Tom.
I think we got some news for you.
The boy is sick, Papa.
This he tries to hide from us.
- Papa, you agree or not?
- I agree.
So why do you sit?
Because it is a sickness not for doctors.
Please, no riddles.
Mamma, just go on pasting in Asa's scrapbook.
You will understand.
Where will he get a good Jewish meal over there, Papa?
Mamma, without Jewish meals,
Gentiles are surviving year after year.
Monte Carlo.
Before they take your money away, they make you dress up yet.
I saw a dozen bluebirds today in the back yard. And he is looking.
A girl with Asa. Who is it?
And if you knew, Mamma, what would you know?
- Again a new girl.
- Mamma, with a man it's only natural.
- This is soup.
- Eat. You'll have another plate.
You don't know, Steve, how we appreciate your visits.
I just come for the food.
For what it costs to come from New York... you could buy a better meal than this.
So, this winter, it's again Florida for Asa.
- He's having a great time.
- Yeah, so he always says.
Wait, do you hear? The radio.
All day long, a Mr. Bing Crosby.
Yes, he's doing all right.
Crooning.
- Very good.
- That's also singing.
And the name "Bing." Go explain people.
- But he's got something.
- Yes.
He's got something.
There was a time they played Asa's records.
That was a joy.
But for years now, you would think Asa isn't alive anymore.
All right, Mamma.
We're eating, not singing. Give him the fish.
This week it's very good, Steve.
And a little horseradish?
There. But be careful.
Don't worry. This stuff got me once.
But I take it easy now.
Very easy.
I am afraid this week it was extra strong.
On his back, Papa. I'll bring the chicken.
Buying a horse, that I understand.
But buying a fighter, a human being.
How is this, Papa?
Foolishness, a tragedy, that's how it is.
A whole world is on fire, a Hitler swallows nations... millions of our people driven, tortured, killed like flies.
You do not want to sing, all right.
But horses, fighters!
Hello, Cantor. This is Steve.
Tell me first, is Mamma any better?
I am afraid not.
The pneumonia came so fast.
Did you reach Asa?
No. I called Havana twice.
He is off cruising on somebody's boat.
They are getting in touch with him by radio.
I don't know how long it'll take him to sail back to Havana and catch a plane.
- You will keep trying, please.
- Sure I will.
Thank you very much, Steve.
Bye.
You all right, Papa?
I wish I had been here.
She understood, Asa.
No sense to feel sorry.
That was a prayer for Mamma.
For Mamma, and all our people.
For their suffering, like millions today.
I know.
You do?
Come, Asa.
Sit down, Asa.
I'll get you something, something to eat, or maybe a cold drink.
No, thanks, Papa, I don't want anything.
- Who looks after you here now?
- Someone comes in.
It is all arranged.
I think I have to lie down for a few minutes.
- Just on the couch.
- Sure, go ahead.
- Just a few minutes. You'll stay?
- Of course I will.
- I am going to call Steve in New York.
- Fine.
How about coming away with me for a while?
- Take a little trip somewhere.
- We are in the war now.
- This is no time for trips.
- A week or so, just for a change.
Thank you.
But prize fights, racetracks, that change I wouldn't need.
- Why do you say that, Papa?
- I merely said a fact.
- You hate everything I've been doing.
- It's your life to throw away.
What do you want me to do?
Who can tell another man?
You want me to get in the war and fight at my age?
A man finds ways to do everything.
But if he is so busy fighting himself...
We will talk later.
Hello?
Oh, he's not? Will he... Come in.
Leave word for Mr. Martin to call Washington, this number... anytime before 11:00.
- That's right. Thanks.
- I'll do that.
Why, you...
Hello, Al.
- How are you?
- Fine.
- When did you get in?
- About an hour ago.
- How is Papa doing?
- Pretty good, Steve.
He is taking a nap in there, right now.
Yeah, he is fine.
Sit down, tell me the news.
- What are you doing around here?
- I got a date in 15 minutes.
This time of night?
I flew down to see a bunch of generals at the war department.
- Who?
- Son, I have enlisted.
Enlisted! Why you're four times older than I am!
- Don't tell me you're going to fight.
- Sure, from behind a desk.
- Quit kidding. What is this about?
- Entertainment for the kids overseas.
- Getting shows together?
- A little more than that.
You see, lots of entertainers are over there now. Good talent.
But they got to have more, and the best.
Those kids are stuck away in
Pacific jungles, Aleutians, Africa, Iceland.
It'd be a terrific boost to morale if they could get the top names to go over.
The biggest performers in the country.
That is the job they want me to tackle.
I guess they figured if I could manage Jolson for 20 years...
I can lick anything.
Yeah, they're right.
You won't have any trouble, Steve.
Big name stars will go once they know what's needed.
It's just a question of getting a few of them to lead the way.
Sure. Darned big job, Steve.
I am proud of you.
Save it, pal.
You know, seven or eight years ago...
I could've been the guy to start this thing off.
- What's the matter with now?
- Don't be silly.
These kids are hep.
They want the stuff they heard back home.
The top guys they know.
How many of them know me now?
But everybody in show business does.
And they have followed you before.
I'm thinking of the kids.
You know, I better get going.
- See you here later?
- Yeah.
So long, Al.
Maybe I'll walk over with you.
All right, boys, hold it. Hold it.
We are going to have a lot of fun tonight.
They've been telling us we're gonna get some big entertainers up here.
And believe it or not, we've got one of them with us right now.
In fact, when I heard this man was coming,
I said:
"They are making good in a big way."
I don't know what the name means to you... but when I was your age, it meant the world's greatest entertainer.
Al Jolson.
Thanks, Colonel.
If I am half as good as that send-off...
I may leave here a second lieutenant.
Hello, gang. I sing.
If you don't believe me, write and ask your grandmothers.
It is wonderful working for guys like you...
'cause if you don't like it, where can you go? It is me or nothing.
All kidding aside, fellows... my stuff isn't what you were hearing back home when you left... but you might like an old one, the way they used to do them.
Orchestra.
We leave home expecting to find a bluebird
Hoping every cloud will be silver-lined
But we all return
And as we live, we learn
That we left our happiness behind
The bird with
feathers of blue
Is waiting for you
Back in your own backyard
You'll see your castle in Spain
Through your windowpane
Back in your own backyard
Oh, you can go to the east
Go to the west
Someday you'll come
Weary at heart
Back where you started from
You'll find your happiness lies
Right under your eyes
Back in your own backyard
Big boot singing to those kids tonight.
I guess they thought I was a little old-timey.
They loved it. You heard them yell.
Yeah, I guess, it was just the idea of something from home.
- Is that my plane?
- They'll call you.
- You ought to relax.
- How do you do that, Colonel?
It is kind of tough doing this, after laying off a long time... and not sure you're getting over, that's what kills you.
You did not get over any better in Duluth,
20 years ago.
- Minnesota, that's where I first heard you.
- Well, I'll be darned.
- The old Lyceum Theatre.
- That's right.
It gets a little chilly in Duluth.
I played hooky from high school once to see Robinson Crusoe.
Oh, boy. That's going way back.
To me, you were the greatest thing that ever lived.
Thanks.
Did you sneak in that afternoon or did you pay?
- Pay.
- Then that's all right.
First time I hit New York, the only thing
I wanted to do was go to the theatre... to see you.
Now I understand about tonight.
You're just an old fan.
I could've knocked you over reciting Little Bo Peep.
Yeah, you could.
- Ready to take off, sir.
- Thank you.
Well, here we go.
Look, Colonel, tell the boys I'll try to get back.
Tell them a lot of big stars will be along soon, but not to forget me.
They'll never forget you were one of the early ones.
That is something.
Colonel Bryant, you've been wonderful.
- Hope we meet up someday back home.
- I hope we do.
In fact, if you are ever in Hollywood...
- Hollywood? Movies?
- I produced a few.
That's a funny one.
- I played in a few of them in my time.
- I remember every one of them.
I'm afraid I do, too.
So long, Duluth. Good luck.
So long, Mr. Jolson. Good luck to you.
I'm looking over a four-leaf clover
That I overlooked before
One leaf is sunshine, the second is rain
Third is the roses that grow in the lane
No need explaining, the one remaining
Is someone that I adore
I'm looking over a four-leaf clover
That I overlooked before
When the red, red robin
Comes bob, bob, bobbing along
There'll be no more sobbing
When he starts throbbing
His own sweet song
Oh, wake up, you sleepy head, get up
Get out of bed, cheer up
The sun is red
Live, love, laugh, and be happy
What if I'd been blue?
Now I am walking through fields of flowers
Rain may glisten
but still I listen for hours and hours
I'm just a kid again
Doing what I did again
singing a song
When the red, red robin
Comes bob, bob, bobbing along
When the red, red robin
Comes bobbing along
Give my regards to Broadway
Remember me to Herald Square
Tell all the gang at 42nd Street
That I will soon be there
Whisper of how I'm yearning
To mingle with the old-time throng
Give my regards to old Broadway
and say that I'll be there e'er long
Chinatown, my Chinatown
Where the lights are low
Hearts that know no other land
Drifting to and fro
Dreamy, dreamy Chinatown
Almond eyes of brown
Hearts seem light, and life seems bright
In dreamy, dreamy China
Dreamy, dreamy China
China, Chinatown
I'm just wild about Harry
Harry's wild about me
The heavenly blisses of his kisses
fill me with ecstasy
He's sweet just like chocolate candy
and like honey from the bee
I'm just wild about Harry
Harry's wild about, I can't live without
Harry's wild about me
And like honey from the bee
Say, I'm just wild about Harry
Harry's wild about, I can't live without
Harry's wild about me
Tie everything down.
We are coming in to New York.
Come on, let's wake up.
That's right.
Baby face, you got the cutest little
I'd say he was going to be just fine.
- When did they bring me back?
- Night before last.
Let's get some more of this down before we talk.
- What was it that hit me?
- A little fever you picked up way back.
- You know, I have seen you someplace.
- You certainly have.
- Where?
- Right here.
- When?
- This morning.
- This morning?
- When you woke up.
I wouldn't forget you. You're pretty.
Just a baby face.
- How do you know?
- You told me.
- Me? When?
- This morning.
- I said that?
- My friend, you sang it.
- Do you have to keep doing that?
- Do you have to keep talking?
- I sang it?
- More or less.
- How was I, in good voice?
- You can do better, I imagine.
You wouldn't know yourself.
You never heard me sing.
Well, to be honest with you.
- That was before your time, honey.
- A little bit.
Of course, you might have come across me in the history books.
Now, I wouldn't say that.
I remember my folks talking about you.
I'd like to meet them.
But I don't imagine
I would be finding them up north.
No, you wouldn't, you would be finding them in Arkansas.
Their name is Clark.
Their daughter's name is Ellen. Ellen Clark.
It saves a lot more questions, doesn't it?
Sure does.
Now we're going to lie back and take a nice, long rest.
- Honey, there's somebody I got to talk to.
- Tomorrow.
Look, I just want to let Steve Martin know I am all right.
Mr. Martin knows. So does Papa.
- Papa? He is here, too?
- He is positively darling.
- Where are they? I want to see them.
- Tomorrow.
Now look, baby, as far as I'm concerned, tomorrow's always the middle of next year.
Rushing around like that is just about the worst thing for anybody.
You don't say.
You are bound to do most everything wrong.
Thanks, honey. Arkansas may feel that way...
Now, you take animals back on the farm, pigs for instance, never rushing around... except, of course, if they see a sudden big shadow, an airplane or a hawk... that scares them and gets them all confused.
I've always believed people who rush around get confused the same way.
You were going to say something?
Yeah. I wouldn't care to see anybody today.
Just as you say, Mr. Jolson.
My, we'll soon be smart as pigs.
- Hello, Papa.
- Asa.
- Steve.
- Jolson, loafing in bed.
He looks fine.
I would positively know him anyplace.
What gets me is how they tell a fever from his normal condition.
- How do you feel, Asa?
- Okay.
- You had quite a tour for yourself?
- I gave it a whirl.
Too big a whirl maybe.
Tell them I'll be okay in a couple of weeks and ready to hop off again.
That is not wise, Asa.
In fact, it sounds positively silly to me.
Boys as sick as he's been are sent away someplace for six months to rest.
- Now, look...
- See? Ellen thinks so, too.
- So it is Ellen already.
- Papa doesn't lose a minute.
And, just what do you call him?
- Cantor, mostly.
- So far, that is.
That fever is going to be in his system a long while.
If he goes hopping around, he's apt to come down bad.
Where do you get all those big answers, honey?
By just relaxing, which is what you ought to do for a change.
Oh, brother!
You mean like back home, maybe?
First thing my folks do almost anytime, we just sit down and take off our shoes.
Sister, his socks are even off and that ain't helping.
If he'd just forget how important he is for once, he might do a sensible thing.
- What do you mean by that?
- Just what I said.
Now listen, sweetheart... whenever I've had a job to do,
I've always done it, see.
That's what I mean.
However, I just came in to say goodbye.
- Goodbye?
- Where are you going?
I'm transferred to an army hospital in Arkansas. I'm leaving in the morning.
- Walking out on me?
- You'll be just fine.
You mean I won't be seeing you again?
I go off duty in a few minutes, and I'll have to pack the rest of the night.
- Goodbye, Mr. Martin.
- Good luck, Ellen.
You can't make cracks at me and walk out. I want to talk to you.
- I really won't have time.
- That is too bad... because I thought on your last evening, how nice if we could have dinner together.
- Now, I will have to have dinner, won't I?
- Delightful.
- At 7:00, shall we say?
- That'll be just fine.
- And for dessert, Ellen?
- No dessert, just coffee, Papa.
- Thank you.
- How will your daughter have her steak?
Rare.
Not my daughter, a friend.
- I beg your pardon.
- "Papa," you see...
- is a certain kind of modern term.
- I understand, sir.
He understands.
- Is this the kind of place you wanted?
- Exactly. Why not?
- A little swanky.
- That's me tonight, swanky.
You know, a waltz is my speciality.
Of course, mine is not exactly a cheek-to-cheek style...
- but if you would honour me?
- I'd love it.
But wouldn't you like to say what you wanted to say to me first?
Remarkable girl.
As a matter of fact,
I only wanted to thank you.
- For what?
- The things you said to my son today.
- A little brutal, wasn't I?
- But delightful.
You know, he's a very nice boy.
Of course, that's a father's opinion.
- You could be right.
- Thank you.
The only thing, he never learned how to live.
You know, there was a look in his eyes when you spoke to him that way... that I had never seen before.
To me, it was like the first step when a baby learns to walk.
- Powerful baby, isn't he?
- Powerful.
And he'll go right on singing when he shouldn't.
I'm afraid so.
You know, in his condition that could be bad.
A baby doesn't walk in a day.
But the important thing, I have a feeling he won't forget what you said.
In fact, if I know my boy, he will have to see you again.
And if he does...
I do not think I'd mind that at all.
- And now?
- Delighted.
- Is there something wrong?
- Just getting back into my shoes.
Remarkable.
You know, Ellen is right, and I am through arguing with you.
You're not going overseas again, and that's all there is to it.
You hear me?
You don't know what a kick it was to be singing again.
- Sure, I do...
- Listen, I found out something.
I have missed it every day since I quit.
I realise now, I've only been half alive.
All of a sudden I've got a terrific yen...
What do you say, Steve, what if
I want to get back on Broadway again?
- Do you think it is too late?
- What do you mean "too late"?
Don't kid me, pal.
Listen, the parade may pass some guys... but anytime you want to get back at the business...
- I wish I could believe it.
- You are crazy.
All right, see what you can dig up for me, Steve.
A Broadway show, anything.
- Will you go to work on it?
- Sure.
- Right away?
- Yeah, right away.
But meanwhile, you got to promise me you're not going overseas again.
Okay.
- Now we're getting someplace.
- All right.
I'll stay home, and make a little tour of these GI hospitals around the country.
Now, wait. Ellen said to knock off everything for at least six months.
- Ellen did.
- Yeah, Ellen did.
You know, Baby Face could be wrong about something.
Baby face, you got the cutest little
Oh, you've got a pretty face
There's not another one
could take your place
Ah, baby face
My poor heart is jumping
You sure have started something
Ah, baby face
I'm up in heaven
when I'm in your fond embrace
I didn't need a shove
'Cause I just fell in love
With your pretty, ah, you baby face
Baby face
You got the cutest
Ah, you got a baby face
There is not another one
could take your place
Ah, baby face
My poor heart is jumping, you sure have
Ah, baby face
I'm up in heaven
when I'm in your fond embrace
You're like a breath of spring
When Jolie sings
about your baby face
I don't know why
I'd want to see anybody like you again... but I couldn't wait to hit this place.
Now, isn't that daffy?
Haven't you been singing too much lately?
That's what I missed about you:
Nobody to boss me around and give me the answers.
I am glad to see you.
In fact, I've been thinking about you.
And, now and then, this is really daffy...
I found myself thinking,
I could even get romantic about that pest.
You know how your mind runs away with you at times.
Sure, mine does with every other man I meet.
It is fun.
- But not exactly fun when I do it.
- Why not?
For instance, if the gal happens to be young, like you...
I suddenly remember I am not so young.
I don't see what difference years make.
I knew a couple once, same age.
- It was terrible.
- It was?
Then I remember something else.
- I was married once.
- I know.
- I made an awful flop of it.
- Why?
It seems all I cared about was singing.
That didn't give marriage much of a chance.
You're afraid you might do the same thing again?
- I guess I do not have to worry about that.
- No?
Because I walked out on all the singing a long time ago.
But you still want to.
- Don't you?
- Yeah.
But the point is, the world ain't exactly clamouring for me anymore.
Well, now, I am just sure the world would again, if you wanted it to.
I like you.
And if it does, just see that you get more out of life than singing.
I will try and remember that, baby, if it ever happens.
I am afraid I would need a little help, though.
I might have to ask somebody like you where to start.
Now, if I am not around, you just try relaxing.
Take off my shoes?
Anything you get fun out of, you just go right ahead and do it.
Right now, it would be terrific fun to kiss you.
Then I would.
What complications, Steve? What is it?
A lung was infected. They had to operate.
Cut out the bad spot.
Now, he's gonna be fine.
He's in good hands.
- Cantor? Hello?
- Yes, Steve.
Believe me, will you?
There is no sense your making a trip out here.
I'll phone you again tomorrow. Goodbye.
The doc says you got a constitution like an ox.
You're gonna mend so fast, nobody will believe it.
Do you know something else?
He says you are as much all there today as you ever were in your life.
- Hello, Ellen.
- Hello, Steve.
I thought you might be needing some answers right now.
Just a good lung, baby. Got one of those?
You are breathing, honey.
Now, who would want a man to do more than that?
I don't believe it. Let me talk to him.
He doesn't believe it.
Hello, Papa. You know this gal gets her way about everything.
But yesterday, out of the hospital, today married. Is this wise?
Never mind. It's lovely. Let me talk to her.
Here.
- Hello, Papa.
- Ellen.
It's really "Papa" now.
Yes, it's wonderful.
You should see this ring.
I got some orchids. If they were any bigger,
I couldn't see around them.
I must see both of you.
I am coming out there.
When?
After the high holidays, in two weeks.
Good. We'll have a nice place waiting for you.
In fact, we are moving into a house today.
- You've got a house already?
- A beautiful one, out in the valley.
It's been rented up to a few months ago, but we can get into it now.
It's Al's house.
- AI's house?
- Yes, the one Julie built.
Imagine looking for a place in these times.
And one sitting out there,
just as vacant and pretty as can be.
It doesn't make sense, at least not in Arkansas.
You understand, don't you, Papa?
Yes. I think I do.
You get out here when you said, in two weeks.
We'll be expecting you.
Yes. Goodbye.
Goodbye, Papa.
Let's get moving.
Now, isn't this a dill?
- Dill?
- Beautiful.
Don't you understand English?
I haven't had time to do much here.
But I'll get going in a couple of days.
First thing, we'll get a little fresh air.
A little dusting wouldn't do any harm.
Aren't you two in pretty poses?
How about getting some of those bags upstairs?
Steve, you do it.
Mr. Jolson, you come over here and sit down.
I've been hoping somebody can play checkers here.
I can keep myself in pin money.
Al, honey... it's cruel to bring you back to this house.
- No, baby.
- I know it is. I must be crazy.
- Fine time to tell me.
- I just didn't want any ghosts around.
I wanted you to wrestle with them here... so you'd know where you stood about the past... and so I would know, too.
That's what I thought.
- That's right, baby.
- No, it isn't.
Look, if there are any ghosts around... this is the place to make them come out and fight.
That's what I'm getting to like about you.
- You're just saying that.
- And I'm meaning that.
Promise me, if this house gets you down... when you can't take it anymore,
I want you to tell me straight out.
Like I could keep something from you if I wanted to.
I also move pianos.
And my heavy cleaning is in demand all over town.
Come on, you two.
You've got years to do that.
Here, I'll take a couple of those.
No arguments.
All right, you win.
Look when she lets me win.
Say, anybody thought about getting help?
How would you like to have
Henry and Alice back?
- Where would you find Henry and Alice?
- Already found them.
They'll be here tonight.
Quit their jobs and are flying back here on broomsticks.
He could go on listening to the radio like that forever.
- Likes music I guess.
- I wouldn't be surprised.
He looks to me like a man about ready to go back to work.
You mean, sing?
- Don't you think he can, Steve?
- Sure.
- But he doesn't think so, does he?
- It's only natural.
- That lung's all healed.
- I suppose it is.
I can see why he'd be afraid.
Or is he afraid that nobody wants to hear him?
In that case, he'd tell himself it was his lung, wouldn't he?
Why worry about it, Ellen?
He's happy enough, isn't he?
Not if what he wants is to be back at work.
- Do you think he does?
- This is a laugh.
There was one woman once who wanted him like this... living a little and not singing his head off.
And here you are now...
- Not exactly a tactful guy, am I?
- Yes, you are, Steve.
I really want him to do both.
All I know... it can't be good when the natural part of a man is just moulding away.
You didn't answer me.
I asked you if you thought...
- he'd like to be back singing again.
- Of course he would.
He'd like to be right back in the middle of show business again.
- He said so?
- Yes.
Just before he started that hospital tour.
Told me to go to work on it.
There is something I haven't told anybody, and wouldn't tell him in a million years.
I did go to work, and the answer is:
Nobody wants him.
Broadway, radio, nobody would risk a nickel on him.
A new crop of singers has pushed Jolson right off the map.
If he tries for a comeback, he'll take the beating of his life.
It would kill him to have to face the truth about it.
So do you see what I mean, Ellen?
If he thinks he's through due to his lung, even if he's lying to himself a little... it's the kindest thing that could have happened.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
See, as good as my word.
I tell you right now, you'll stay a long time.
If I like it here, I won't argue.
- Henry! I don't believe it.
- It's nice to see you again, Cantor.
- My goodness, it's a long time.
- Many years.
- You don't look a day older.
- Neither do you.
What a comfort we are to each other.
I don't have to ask if you are happy.
- I do not know.
- Miserable?
Husband out of work, lazing around the house all day.
Not good.
Steve says he isn't wanted anymore... and he'd take a beating if he tried to sing again.
I am wondering, Papa, which would be the worse beating:
Trying or just never singing again at all.
It's hard to say, Ellen.
You mean, if I were smart,
I'd mind my own business.
Women in love never do.
Is that bad?
Bad. Good.
It's history.
You know, it's nice you're here, Papa.
I've been sort of waiting for you.
Dinner must be ready.
We have to get some special entertainment for Papa.
Me? Entertainment?
Don't you like to go dancing in swanky restaurants?
That was in my younger days.
There's a benefit show for the Community Chest next week.
A lot of big stars will be on the program.
Would you like to go?
- Nice. Very nice.
- I'll see that we're there.
- AI?
- Sure. Fine.
To give Papa a real thrill, you ought to be on that stage that night.
- What doing, telling jokes?
- What you always did.
- Yeah?
- Just a song or two.
- Bet you one would be enough.
- I don't know.
If you sound as good as you do when you sing in the bathroom.
Bathroom? You just hum a little.
With all that resonance in there, you sound like Caruso.
Don't you know that's why people sing in there?
- And you especially like it, don't you?
- Love it.
Why don't you try coming out of the bathroom for a change?
The public might love it, too.
You're trying to get me back to work or something?
I don't want a man lazing around the house all the rest of his life.
You sound like you're only half kidding.
- About half.
- Only half?
In that case, tell you what to do, Steve.
You hop to New York and get a show together for me.
Tell them not to worry about my recent operation.
Of course, I haven't got the breath for those high notes anymore...
Or radio. That'd be better.
They ought to be wild to have me.
A name like Jolson... a name that bobbysoxers never heard of, that's true... and a style of singing that went out with button shoes.
Or did you find that out already, Steve?
- Find out what?
- You know what.
I was gonna make a big comeback.
What did you find out?
Bet they were dying to have me back.
I really didn't get started, but there was a lot of interest.
I see.
Of course, without your name in lights on Broadway... and making oodles of money,
I guess it wouldn't be singing.
What do you mean?
During the war, you sang just to do something...
- for the fun of it.
- Sure. But that was then.
Even now, I can't see why you have to be worried about a little old benefit.
There's gonna be 5,000 people at that little old benefit... in a big theatre. Not a thing to worry about.
Except if I can put two notes together... and whether they can hear me past the second row.
You can prove that to yourself.
Come on. What's the use talking about it?
Okay. If you're sure you can't.
What if I wasn't sure?
I don't see anybody breaking down doors to get me on that benefit.
- Maybe if they knew you wanted to...
- Let's drop it, baby.
Sure.
How about a game of checkers tonight, Papa?
No thank you, Ellen.
I couldn't eat another thing.
- Pretty tune.
- That's the big one right now.
Made to order for these crooners.
They sure sing this stuff today nice and easy, don't they?
Who says you need all the voice in the world to put a song over.
'Cause I only have eyes
for you, dear
The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
'Cause I only have eyes
for you
I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
You are here, so am I
Maybe millions of people pass by
But they all disappear
from view
And I
only have eyes
for you
Must be the resonance in here.
Resonance, of course.
Okay, Steve.
If they can use me on that benefit.
- You win.
- Another game, Papa?
Another game, Steve?
I'm glad he's in shape again, Steve.
But actually, I got too big a list of stars, right now.
Every year, the program's too long.
You know how it is.
Yeah, I know.
If you could still get a big name, you'd grab it.
You just don't want Jolson.
Ten years ago, you'd be kissing his feet to get him.
Be reasonable. All I'm trying to do is get a big turnout for a benefit.
I've got to have names that mean something.
I don't care what you got to have.
When Al Jolson says he'll appear... the guy you and I remember when he was bigger than your whole list put together...
I'm not going to that guy with some lame excuse... that adds up to only one thing:
He's not wanted.
I can't do it, Charlie.
And you're not gonna make me do it.
All right, Steve. He's on.
- Hi.
- Good morning, baby.
Today is the day. Is it in the paper?
Let me see it.
My name is a little hard to find, baby.
It is at the bottom there.
"And many others." That's me.
- Nice day?
- Yeah. Real nice.
This is going way over time.
- Look at the time, Ralph. Let's go.
- No, wait. Please.
There's one fellow I've got to hear.
It's great to go on near the finish, except there won't be any audience.
Where is everybody?
Seriously, I guess I've got a few old friends out there.
Who else would be hanging around at this hour?
So I'm gonna sing you an old one, just one and let you go home.
By the way, a nice quiet one... so as we won't disturb the people who sleep.
Just like we rehearsed it, pal.
Climb upon my knee, sonny boy
Though you are only three, sonny boy
You have no way of knowing
There's no way of showing
What you mean to me
sonny boy
When there are grey skies
I don't mind the grey skies
You make them blue
sonny boy
Friends, friends may forsake me
Let them, let them all forsake me
I still have you
sonny boy
You are sent from heaven
and I know your worth
You have made a heaven
for me here on earth
And the angels grew lonely
Took you, because they were lonely
I am lonely, too
sonny boy
Nothing like singing for a lot of old-timers.
- I liked it, and I am not an old-timer.
- But you happen to be very nice.
Better watch the road, honey.
Amazing how he can still get you with a corny old song like that.
I think he can still get anybody, singing anything.
Singing styles have changed a little, Ralph.
I don't know about that.
But I know one thing.
His voice is better now than it ever was, warmer, more heart.
Oddly enough... a certain newspaper columnist brought me a picture idea a few weeks ago:
The Life of Jolson.
He had to bring that idea to me, an old fan.
Listening to that voice tonight,
I kept thinking... if you could give people a real chance to hear him again...
Bit of a tough one, though.
- It was a beating, wasn't it?
- What?
This whole thing tonight that I plagued you into doing.
It wasn't anything, honey.
I just said to myself:
"Now in Arkansas, we'd look at it this way."
I know I'm not headlining this show.
I got a hunch they don't even want me on it.
I know half this crowd didn't want to hear me sing.
The other half is only sticking around for old times' sake. I know all that.
I didn't come here for glory.
I just came to do something I wanted to do.
I don't care.
You were absolutely marvellous tonight.
There you are.
And I got something out of my system.
In fact, a couple more jobs like tonight, and I'm a pretty happy man.
So what are you talking about?
Hello?
Yes, it is.
That's all right.
Who?
Oh, yes. How are you?
You really liked it, didn't you, pal?
It's nice of you to call and tell me.
No, that's okay. I hadn't gone to bed yet.
Thanks a lot.
Why, sure.
Anytime. I am generally home.
Thanks again. Goodnight.
Bryant?
How are you, Mr. Bryant?
You still don't know me, do you?
Colonel Bryant, the Aleutians.
- Duluth, Minnesota.
- That's right.
If it ain't old Duluth! It had to be an old fan.
I'm glad to see you.
Come on out and meet the family.
They will love you.
They are fans of mine, too.
And, brother, how many members of that club are still around?
Meet Colonel Bryant. My wife, Mrs. Jolson.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- My father and Steve Martin.
- How are you, sir?
- Glad to know you, sir.
- How do you do?
This fellow phones in the middle of the night to tell me I am terrific.
- Don't you love him?
- Mad about him.
See. Old homely.
- Sit down. Stay for lunch with us.
- Thanks. I'd like to.
You'll want him to stay for dinner, too,
'cause up in the Aleutians... if it hadn't been for the pat on the back he gave me...
I was worried and scared stiff.
He picked me right up off the floor.
In fact, you can bring your clothes and move in, Colonel Bryant.
Let's forget the "Colonel."
I'm just a picture producer again.
I didn't tell you that.
Came from Hollywood all the time.
How does it feel to be back making movies?
They are always tough, except when you get a really exciting idea.
- And I got one last night, listening to you.
- Yeah?
I didn't sleep much.
This morning I was still at it.
So I thought I'd come over and talk to you about it.
- What's that?
- A motion picture.
You mean you want me to play a part or something? Me?
No. A picture about you. Your whole career.
- Sound crazy?
- My friend, as goofy as can be.
- Why?
- Why?
- Last night should tell you why.
- Last night brought me out here.
Yeah, you and a few hundred others.
But you make pictures today for a whole new generation.
They buy the tickets.
What's in this one for them?
The story of the biggest man in entertainment for 30 years... singing the biggest songs.
- That are deader than a doornail.
- Not when you sing them.
Amazing fellow.
Don't you love him? You would.
Look, pal, I'm going to forget you ever mentioned an idea like this...
'cause if it ever got out you'd have the whole town laughing at you.
That's the best thing this town does.
- Just begging for trouble, aren't you?
- Give me some reasons.
He wants reasons.
- That's only fair. Give him some.
- Reasons.
Look, I was singing in vaudeville at 15.
Let's say when I was really getting underway in my 20s.
You expect me to play a 20-year-old on the screen today?
I know, that one I wrestled with last night.
- But suppose somebody else played it?
- Somebody else?
- But me singing, of course.
- Of course.
You mean, put the songs through him like he was singing.
I know a lot of the kick is how you put the songs over.
I'm not talking about that.
I've seen a thousand guys imitate me, and good, too.
But this would be my stuff coming out of his mouth on the screen...
- just like I sang it?
- I think it could be done.
Let's say we found the guy and he is great, but look, the songs?
Couldn't use the old recordings
I made years ago, right?
I'm afraid it is.
The sound quality of those old recordings would be pretty bad today.
So I'd have to sing them all over again?
I guess you'd have to.
Just like I sang them back on Broadway... where your picture is gonna show how I used to knock them dead.
- I happen to think you can.
- Oh, brother!
I know I'm better than I was in Duluth 20 years ago.
All that has happened since, not hitting very well on one cylinder... and sing four keys lower.
- Nobody would have known that last night.
- Because that was Sonny Boy.
- Why not anything else?
- Anything else, pal?
Those Mammies, those Rock-A-Byes, you've got to give out.
- You think you couldn't do that?
- Think I couldn't do it?
- Have you tried?
- No, he hasn't.
Then why don't you?
Why not come in to the studio and make a recording or two?
When could you do that?
- What do I say to this madman?
- That you are free almost anytime.
- What is the matter?
- Butterflies.
Like opening night on Broadway. Come on.
Let's have playback, voice and orchestra.
Let me out of here.
I'd rather spend a year in solitary.
How can a man sing with the orchestra in Honolulu?
You looked great. Now we'll hear it.
- Maybe we ought to skip the whole thing.
- We'll see.
- I think you are going to like it.
- Ready.
One, two, three, four.
Yesterday, I heard a lover sigh
Goodbye, oh me, oh my
Seven times he got aboard his train
And seven times he hurried back
to kiss his love again, and tell her
Toot, Toot, Tootsie, goodbye
Toot, Toot, Tootsie, don't cry
The choo-choo train
that takes me away from you
No words can tell how sad it makes me
Kiss me, Tootie, and then
Do it over again
Watch for the mail, I'll never fail
If you don't get a letter
then you'll know I'm in jail
Don't cry, Tootie, don't cry
Goodbye, Tootsie, goodbye
What's all the mystery?
What are we gonna see?
- I told you, a little experiment, that's all.
- What's it got to do with me?
That's what we're gonna find out.
Okay, Bill. Let's go.
One, two, three, four.
Yesterday, I heard a lover sigh
Goodbye, oh me, oh my
Seven times he got aboard his train
And seven times he hurried back
to kiss his love again, and tell her
Toot, Toot, Tootsie, goodbye
What's going on here? Who is that?
The choo-choo train that takes me
- That's the recording I made.
- Of course it is.
Who's the guy there?
Kiss me, Tootie, and then
do it over again
Watch for the mail, I'll never fail
If you don't get a letter
then you'll know I'm in jail
Don't cry, Tootie, don't cry
Goodbye, Tootsie, goodbye!
Wonderful. Who was that?
Meet a young fellow named Larry Parks.
Let's agree on one thing at the start, boys.
I don't think anybody cares about the facts of my life... about dates and places.
I'll give you a mess of them, you juggle them any way you like.
What matters is the singing a man did, and the difference that made.
The thing to tell is a kid who ran away from home when he was 15...
'cause he was crazy to sing.
Never stopped once through years of show business, singing thousands of songs.
A guy who ate, drank, and slept nothing else.
And when you get to Julie Benson, that's important.
'Cause then you find out it's really the story of a wrong guy... who only cared about being a big hit, and always leading the parade.
He thought he was crazy about her, and when she walked out...
Though, if you ask him today, when she left, it was just his pride... that was kicked around,
'cause in those days... he really couldn't think of anything but himself.
He had to get tossed on the shelf, and take a beating... before he began to learn there might be something else in the world.
I'm scared of this picture.
If it ever went over,
I might get wound up like the old Jolson.
- I'd like to call the whole thing off.
- You would?
But my wife won't let me.
- Well, where are we?
- Still at the beginning.
I guess the place to start would be back in Washington when I was a kid... singing with my father in the synagogue.
But what I was really interested in was the burlesque house... a few blocks down the street.
California, here I come
Right back where I started from
Where bowers of flowers
bloom in the spring
Each morning at dawning
birdies sing at everything
You made me love you
I didn't wanna do it
You made me want to
And all the time you knew it
I guess you always knew it
You made me happy sometimes
Oh, you made me glad
But there were times, baby
you dog
You made me cry for
I didn't wanna tell you
I want some love that's true
You know I do, indeed, I do, yes, I do
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme what I cry for
You know you got the kind of kisses
that I'd die for
You know you made me love you
- Good evening, Mr. Bryant.
- Hello.
You better hurry, you've got about five minutes, sir.
- What's that you keep taking all the time?
- Just something for my nerves.
- Anything wrong with you?
- No, I feel fine.
What are you stalling around for?
Come on, we'll be late.
The weather holds fair for the slalom...
but then the snow begins to fly again.
Jack Frost holds wintry court high
in a magic wonderland of whirling white.
The contestants, like the weather,
run both hot and cold...
and in all directions, from pole to pole.
But despite the heavy falls,
some collegians average...
almost a mile a minute.
- Can I help you?
- No, thanks.
What's the matter?
- I just can't take it in there.
- You're not going to see the picture?
I'll watch from back here.
I may be in later. You go on in.
- You look a little groggy to me.
- You're crazy. Go back in.
Rosie, you are my posie
You are my heart's bouquet
Come out here in the moonlight
There's something sweet, love
I'm gonna sing about my baby
Your honey, your boy, I'm waiting
Those ruby, those lips to greet
Don't be so aggravating
My blushing Rosie
My posie sweet
He's all right. The kid's great.
Me singing, you know.
Mammy
my little Mammy
I'd walk a million miles
For one of your smiles
My Mammy
Mammy
My little Mammy
The sun shines east, the sun shines west
I know where the sun shines best
It's on my Mammy
I'm talkin' about nobody else's
My little Mammy
My heartstrings are tangled around
Alabammy
Mammy, Mammy, I'm comin'
I hope I didn't make you wait
Mammy, Mammy, I'm comin'
I hope I'm not late
Mammy, look at me! Don't you know me?
I'm your little baby
I'd walk a million miles
for one of your smiles
my Mammy
Swanee, how I love you, how I love you
My dear old Swanee
The folks up north will see me no more
When I get to that Swanee shore
He shall die
He shall die
He shall die
For I'll raise a bunion on his Spanish onion
if I catch him bending tonight
California, here I come
Right back where I started from
Where bowers of flowers
bloom in the spring
Each morning at dawning
birdies sing at everything
Are you all right, Mr. Jolson?
Just a little tired.
Maybe you'd like to come back and sit in my office for a while?
A minute or two maybe.
And then the world is gonna be mine
Mine, all mine
This evening around a quarter to nine
The world was in bloom
There were stars in the skies
Except for the few
that were there in your eyes
Dear, as I held you close in my arms
Angels were singing a hymn to your charms
Two hearts gently beating, murmuring low
Darling, I love you so
Watch them shuffling along
See them shuffling along
It's simply great, mate
They are in the nightclub now.
Waiting for the Robert E. Lee
Though April showers
I've got to see the finish of this.
They bring the flowers
Feel fine.
So if it's raining
Have no regrets
Because it isn't raining rain, you know
It's raining violets
And where you see clouds
upon the hills
You soon will see crowds of daffodils
So keep on looking for a bluebird
and listening for its song
Whenever April showers
come along
The house record doubled in Cincy. Amazing!
- What town?
- Cincy.
Jolson records are on the radio all day long.
Mamma would be happy.
This radio offer: Your own program.
- You got to make up your mind.
- I say no, Steve.
I say yes.
But why, baby? What for?
It's your right to hear those bobbysoxers squeal.
Nothing could be finer
than to be in Carolina
in the morning
No one could be sweeter
than my sweetie when I meet her
in the morning
Where the morning glories
twine around the door
Whispering pretty stories
I long to hear once more
Strolling with my girlie
Where the dew is pearly
early in the morning
Butterflies all flutter up
And kiss each little buttercup
at dawning
If I had Aladdin's lamp for only a day
I'd make a wish and here's what I'd say
Nothing could be finer
than to be in Carolina
in the morning
Rock-a-bye your baby
with a Dixie melody
When you croon
Croon a little tune
From the heart of Dixie
Hang that cradle, Mammy mine
Right on that Mason-Dixon line
And swing it from Virginia
to Tennessee with all the soul that's in you
Weep no more, my lady
Ah, sing it, ah, sing it, Mammy
Sing it for me
Old Black Joe, just as though
you had me on your knee
A million baby kisses I'll deliver
If you will only sing that Swanee River
Rock-a-bye, your rock-a-bye baby
with a Dixie melody
{3103}{3155}Hotel Acuna, please.
{3410}{3475}- What's his name?|- Eduardo Acuna. He's the big boss.
{3479}{3533}- Here's his office.|- Oh, thanks.
{3537}{3570}Oh, boy.
{3634}{3702}I'll get you later. Thanks.
{3706}{3801}I absolutely, positively|cannot interrupt Mr. Acuna.
{3806}{3845}He is busy.
{3878}{3935}Sorry, those are my orders.
{3939}{3986}Please don't blame me.
{4001}{4088}- When he's free, I'd like to see him.|- I ask myself the same question.
{4092}{4193}Why see Mr. Acuna when there are so|many pleasant people they could see?
{4206}{4257}Tell him Robert Davis|of New York is here.
{4262}{4325}- Robert Davis.|- {y:i}Yes?
{4329}{4402}Mr. Robert Davis of New York|to see you, Mr. Acuna.
{4406}{4473}{y:i}I never heard of him.|{y:i}Tell him to go away.
{4518}{4617}Well, I must say, I'm used to|more cordiality than that.
{4621}{4668}He's making a big mistake.
{4672}{4775}Mr. Davis, you impress me.|What did you want to see him about?
{4834}{4864}That.
{4875}{4906}What?
{4961}{4991}That.
{5002}{5071}- I only asked you a civil question.|- And I answered you.
{5238}{5326}- You don't mind if I wait?|- No, but it won't do you any good.
{5336}{5421}That's very nice. The wedding dress|and the lingerie, I approve.
{5426}{5469}You may go, and thank you.
{5516}{5570}Well, darling,|what's been going on here?
{5574}{5663}Eduardo had a slight disagreement|with Delfina about Julia's trousseau...
{5667}{5714}...so now he's picking out|one himself.
{5718}{5793}It's my invariable rule to distrust|women's taste in clothes.
{5797}{5835}That's why he asked me to come by.
{5839}{5895}First time I heard of a father|selecting a trousseau.
{5899}{5979}You know as well as I do that women|dress for one another, not for men.
{5983}{6039}Delfina's mother put her in fluff|when I married her.
{6043}{6109}She's been in fluff ever since.|Does your son like fluff?
{6114}{6197}My dear, for the first few weeks,|he won't know what Julia's wearing.
{6202}{6281}- Will your wife forgive you for this?|- Forgive me? I expect to be thanked.
{6285}{6389}- And thank you, Maria, for coming.|- That's all right. Goodbye, Eduardo.
{6633}{6715}- Who are you, the florist?|- Do I look like a florist?
{6719}{6795}How do I know what a florist|looks like? Who are you?
{6799}{6852}Xavier Cugat, remember me?
{6856}{6936}Didn't I bring you down here|from New York for something?
{6940}{7011}My orchestra has packed|your Sky Room for the past two weeks.
{7015}{7045}That is something!
{7050}{7124}I never go to the Sky Room.|My cover charge is too high.
{7129}{7209}Of course! You're to play|at my daughter's wedding tomorrow.
{7217}{7258}Very well.
{7282}{7417}Play this softly and remotely,|as though you were not there.
{7435}{7534}Mr. Acuna, you can forget my name,|stay away from the Sky Room...
{7538}{7642}...underpay me, but you cannot|dictate how my orchestra should play.
{7682}{7762}You play this softly.
{7821}{7897}How I wish I was back at the Waldorf.
{8130}{8200}- Bob Davis!|- Cugie!
{8204}{8234}What are you doing here?
{8238}{8306}I just came down for a holiday.|I didn't know you were here.
{8310}{8370}A holiday? You didn't know|there was a racetrack here?
{8374}{8428}- Well, yes, and...|- And now you're broke again?
{8432}{8494}Yep, I gotta put these feet|back to work for a while.
{8498}{8593}But, gee, I like it here. You know,|the people, the city, the horses.
{8597}{8685}But this fellow, Acuna, he's tough.|He won't see me.
{8690}{8739}Acuna won't see him?
{8743}{8800}Why, in New York,|he won't see Acuna.
{8804}{8877}This, Fernando,|is the greatest man in the world.
{8882}{8970}Tell Acuna that Mr. Davis will give him|just two minutes of his time.
{8974}{9035}Oh, no. You tell him.
{9050}{9081}Yes, Mr. Acuna?
{9086}{9177}{y:i}Remind me to give Cugat back|{y:i}to the Waldorf. He annoys me.
{9234}{9309}Very funny man.|He kills me.
{9314}{9417}You know, actually I have a great deal|of influence with Acuna. What's that?
{9421}{9484}I didn't say a thing.|Just minding my own business.
{9488}{9589}Come along. I've a show to do. While|we play, we'll think of something.
{13377}{13447}Terrific! I've made up my mind.|We'll work together again!
{13451}{13534}- With you, we'll be better than terrific.|- I don't like Acuna's attitude.
{13538}{13610}- I'm going to change it right now.|- No, I have a better way.
{13614}{13694}I'm playing at his daughter's wedding.|You will sing, you will dance.
{13698}{13814}You will be sensational!|Acuna will come to you on his knees.
{14163}{14200}It's almost time, Julia.
{14204}{14287}Here's your something old, sis, and|a new coin for your something new.
{14291}{14321}Thanks, Lita.
{14326}{14375}And Mama's handkerchief|for something borrowed.
{14379}{14423}Here's something blue, Julia
{14427}{14493}The bridegroom's supposed|to sleep on it, or something.
{14498}{14569}I suppose I should put|the coin in my shoe.
{14620}{14685}You'll be the next bride|in the family, Maria.
{14690}{14783}- Oh, no. Not me.|- Oh, but you have to be.
{14787}{14868}Papa made it very clear that we can't|get married until after you do.
{14872}{14951}He says it's our family tradition|that the girls be disposed of...
{14955}{14999}...one, two, three, four.
{15003}{15041}And you'll be the oldest now.
{15045}{15098}Papa will get over that silly tradition.
{15102}{15194}No, he won't.|Papa never gets over anything.
{15210}{15297}You don't expect to marry those|two tennis-playing Romeos, do you?
{15302}{15370}But we love Tony and Roddy|passionately.
{15374}{15461}They've even given us|their signet rings, see?
{15465}{15510}Why, you're babies.
{15514}{15638}You just don't know what it's like to be|so much in love that you cry all night.
{15645}{15675}You're right there.
{15679}{15756}It's all right for you to talk.|You turn men down by the dozens.
{15760}{15806}You've got an ice cube for a heart.
{15810}{15905}- Unaccustomed as I am to getting a...|- There's something wrong with Maria.
{15910}{16022}- She says she'll never get married.|- I did not say that.
{16026}{16141}You know, Papa, I think you'd better|put a cooling system in their room.
{16180}{16246}Now, you leave Maria to me.|Don't worry, she's next...
{16250}{16315}...and then will come your turn,|and then yours.
{16319}{16371}- Do we have to wait for Maria?|- Yes.
{16375}{16442}And this is a fine way to act|on your sister's wedding day.
{16446}{16506}Now, run along|and fix your pretty faces.
{16614}{16680}Getting nervous, dear?|We're going to miss you.
{16684}{16752}Has Mama forgiven you yet|for picking out my trousseau?
{16756}{16794}I don't know. Her door was locked.
{16798}{16865}She broke down and confessed|that she liked my dress.
{16870}{16981}These skirmishes I have with your|mother are not typical of married life.
{16996}{17061}- Aren't they, Father?|- No, they're just typical of me.
{17065}{17138}- I'm very difficult to live with.|- No, you're not, darling.
{17142}{17202}You're really just a little boy,|and I love you.
{17206}{17257}And I love you too, darling.
{17261}{17293}Will you hook me, Eduardo?
{17298}{17379}Delfina, don't you think it's about time|you learned to dress yourself?
{17383}{17461}It's so hard for me to believe I'm old|enough to have a married daughter.
{17465}{17521}It doesn't put any strain on me.
{17526}{17597}Julia.|Where are the rest of my girls?
{17601}{17671}Oh, Maria! Lita! Cecy!
{17675}{17737}- Coming, Mother.|- Coming, Mama!
{17801}{17869}I want to see you all in a row.
{17912}{17972}Oh! I'm going to cry tonight.
{17977}{18081}You'd better start now. It's getting late.|Do you want some last-minute advice?
{18085}{18138}Just don't act too intelligent|on your honeymoon.
{18142}{18189}I made that mistake with your father.
{18193}{18285}That reminds me. Tell me something|clever to say after the wedding.
{18289}{18363}Oh, dear, I'm so happy.
{18402}{18462}Hurry, girls.|Now remember, keep in step.
{18466}{18546}I am going to cry.|I'm going to cry right now.
{21842}{21889}He didn't even look around.
{22218}{22330}Have your son pass the word. I have|three more where Julia came from.
{22352}{22438}- You two ask Papa now.|- While he's laughing.
{22456}{22490}Come on.
{22596}{22640}- Mr. Acuna.|- Yes?
{22644}{22725}We've been going with your daughters|Cecy and Lita for two years now and...
{22730}{22785}What do you want, a pension?
{22922}{23021}- All right, who's going to be next?|- I am.
{23057}{23114}- Maria has to catch it.|- Yes.
{23255}{23286}But I don't want it.
{23290}{23353}- Here's a volunteer groom.|- Let's have a double wedding.
{23358}{23397}- I'm between engagements.|- Here I am.
{23402}{23434}How about me?
{23447}{23517}Oh, you're all much too kind.
{23612}{23713}Papa! Papa! Did you see Maria?|She froze those boys.
{23717}{23798}Papa, you've just got|to do something about her.
{23979}{24062}Pardon me, could you please tell me|where I could find Mr. Acuna?
{24066}{24114}He went inside.
{24199}{24305}On second thought,|I guess old {y:i}el groucho can wait.
{24331}{24407}Don't these overdone weddings|bore you to death? They kill me.
{24411}{24471}I say if two people want|to get married, let them.
{24475}{24573}They don't have to go through|a shindig like this. It's murder.
{24751}{24855}Oh, well, I'll admit my attempt|at conversation wasn't so hot.
{24915}{24964}Shall I try again?
{25074}{25124}It's a nice day, isn't it?
{25158}{25207}The air's nice.
{25250}{25330}And there seems to be|an abundance of it.
{25386}{25511}Say, look, would you mind very much|if I tear myself away from you?
{25523}{25555}No.
{25860}{25893}But you don't understand.
{25898}{25985}Now, let's hear no more about Maria.|Run along, girls.
{26036}{26125}May I see you a moment, please?|It's very important to both of us.
{26129}{26219}I'm Robert Davis.|I came here to dance and...
{26223}{26257}Hello.
{26307}{26379}Now, what is there about that girl|that made you go...?
{26383}{26425}She's beautiful.
{26454}{26485}She's beautiful, all right.
{26490}{26562}But she has a personality|like the inside of a refrigerator.
{26566}{26617}In addition to which,|she is my daughter.
{26622}{26670}She is? She is?!
{26674}{26759}She is. Now, what was it|you wanted of me?
{26776}{26865}Just your permission to go out|and hang myself.
{27038}{27073}{y:i}Fernando.
{27202}{27238}{y:i}Fernando!
{27290}{27320}{y:i}Fernando!
{27354}{27390}What?
{27400}{27457}{y:i}Were you sleeping again?
{27462}{27577}{y:i}Tell me, my dear Fernando,|{y:i}why do I put up with you?
{27594}{27634}I don't know, Mr. Acuna...
{27638}{27738}...unless it's because I'm your|third cousin on your wife's side.
{27762}{27841}Ah, yes. Did you get Mrs. Castro?
{27847}{27920}Mrs. Castro is on her way here.
{27925}{27971}{y:i}All right.
{28006}{28081}{y:i}Now go back to sleep, Fernando.
{28140}{28193}{y:i}I dare you to!
{28247}{28301}- Hi, Fernando.|- Good morning, Mr. Davis.
{28305}{28381}It's good to hear the voice|of a human being again. Sit down?
{28386}{28470}No, thanks. I'd like to see|Mr. Acuna if he's not busy.
{28474}{28538}This morning he's nervous.|He probably won't see you.
{28542}{28586}- How'd you make out?|- Oh, fine.
{28590}{28677}I opened my mouth too wide|and kept it open too long.
{28682}{28749}I want to apologize to the old boy.
{28766}{28833}Mr. Robert Davis wants|to see you, Mr. Acuna.
{28838}{28905}{y:i}I don't like Mr. Robert Davis.|{y:i}I don't want to see him.
{28909}{28970}{y:i}Advise him to go back to New York|{y:i}and don't be subtle.
{28974}{29008}{y:i}Throw him out!
{29012}{29070}But look, Mr. Acuna, I just...
{29142}{29214}This is the first time anything|like this has ever happened to me.
{29276}{29310}Oh, lady.
{29314}{29386}Better not to go in there. Nervous.
{29485}{29539}- Good morning, Maria.|- Eduardo.
{29543}{29633}I'm a worried man. Maria,|besides having the same name...
{29637}{29701}...you and my Maria have a lot|in common, haven't you?
{29706}{29758}Well, I'm her godmother,|we should have.
{29762}{29867}Would you say she has a personality|like the inside of a refrigerator?
{29882}{29915}I certainly would not.
{29919}{29999}But she freezes men to death.|She turns on that sophistication...
{30003}{30047}Sophistication, fiddlesticks!
{30051}{30103}Maria's as old-fashioned|as a hoop skirt.
{30107}{30158}Ridiculous! I know my own daughter.
{30162}{30209}You think you know|your own daughter.
{30213}{30251}I know there's something wrong.
{30255}{30309}She hasn't fallen in love|since she was 15...
{30314}{30396}...when she got starry-eyed about|that silly knight on a white horse.
{30401}{30437}- Lochinvar?|- Yes.
{30442}{30497}You'd think she'd have outgrown|that tin hero by now.
{30502}{30562}She's probably waiting|for a myth to come to life.
{30566}{30676}Oh, nonsense! Will you stop thinking|of Maria as a child? She's a woman.
{30680}{30773}I know women. They all fall in love|with an illusion. I'll get her over that.
{30777}{30850}Will you leave Maria alone|and stop worrying?
{30854}{30922}Someday, a man will come along|who will stir her imagination.
{30926}{30958}How?
{30963}{31028}By doing something|more romantic than the others.
{31032}{31072}Such as?
{31076}{31200}Well, perhaps by sending her flowers|from an "unknown admirer"...
{31204}{31293}...intriguing her|with just the right kind of note.
{31341}{31415}Fernando! Get the two most|beautiful orchids you can find.
{31419}{31473}Bring them here for a note|to be attached.
{31477}{31545}Eduardo, don't you meddle with this.
{31550}{31598}If I don't do something,|she'll get hurt.
{31602}{31697}I won't stand by and let her waste the|best years of her life chasing knights.
{31701}{31781}Have you gone crazy?|You can't manufacture romance.
{31786}{31850}I'll create an unknown admirer|and see what happens.
{31854}{31934}I'll use my left hand|to disguise my writing. Clever?
{31938}{32006}You think you have the answer|for everything.
{32010}{32074}What if she falls in love|with your imaginary lover?
{32078}{32144}Don't worry. If the orchids|and notes intrigue her...
{32148}{32240}...l'll furnish the young man myself.|She'll never know the difference.
{32244}{32293}Dearly beloved...
{32313}{32387}Eduardo, I'm warning you.
{33141}{33227}- Papa! Hello, Aunt Maria.|- Hello.
{33250}{33281}What are you doing here?
{33285}{33344}Must I have an invitation|to my own home for tea?
{33348}{33421}- Is that you, Eduardo?|- Yes, yes.
{33426}{33465}What on earth are you doing here?
{33470}{33543}You'd think my only privilege|in this house was paying the bills.
{33547}{33590}Aunt Maria, it's good to see you.
{33594}{33661}- Wasn't that the doorbell?|- Expecting somebody, Papa?
{33666}{33739}No, why should I be expecting|somebody? Sit down, Maria.
{33743}{33780}Thank you.
{33850}{33924}I'm really upset with your son, Maria...
{33928}{33985}...and with your daughter Julia,|Eduardo!
{33989}{34045}I went to the hotel|where they're honeymooning.
{34049}{34131}- What for? In the name of all...|- Don't speak when I'm interrupting.
{34135}{34186}To see if there was anything|I could do for them.
{34190}{34221}As if there would be.
{34225}{34323}I thought they'd want to discuss what|they intend to do on their honeymoon.
{34327}{34384}But they sent down word|they weren't in.
{34388}{34429}Perhaps they weren't, Delfina.
{34433}{34515}At the same time, they also sent down|for a bottle of champagne.
{34519}{34571}- I felt like...|- Wasn't that the doorbell?
{34575}{34665}Something's wrong with Papa.|He's always hearing bells.
{35004}{35061}Well, well, well! Orchids.
{35065}{35121}Shame on Tony.|He should save his money.
{35125}{35208}- How do you know they're not for me?|- Bring me the flowers, Cecy.
{35233}{35283}Why, there's a card inside.
{35287}{35338}Nobody ever sends me flowers.
{35342}{35375}After a woman gets married...
{35379}{35433}...her husband decides|she can't smell anymore.
{35437}{35510}Now, don't get that martyred look.|They're for Maria.
{35514}{35591}- For Maria?|- Why, they... They are for Maria.
{35595}{35654}Well, somebody's|just trying to be funny.
{35665}{35725}"Dearly beloved,|I send you orchids..."
{35729}{35785}- Let Maria read her own card.|- Go ahead, Mama.
{35789}{35843}It probably ends up with a joke.
{35847}{35980}"...because my heart is no longer mine,|now that I have seen you.
{35985}{36040}Be kind to these orchids.
{36044}{36170}It is not their fault that they can|never be as lovely as you."
{36181}{36237}Why, it brought tears to my eyes.
{36241}{36299}That note was written by a man|with a sensitive soul.
{36303}{36362}It sounded pretty silly to me.
{36366}{36440}A charming man sends you the most|beautiful note ever written...
{36445}{36483}...and you say it sounds silly?
{36487}{36589}"Your unknown suitor." And I don't|think much of his handwriting.
{36598}{36662}Well, perhaps he's left-handed.
{36692}{36750}How does this card strike you,|Aunt Maria?
{36754}{36827}If it had been sent to me|and I didn't know who'd written it...
{36831}{36930}...I should think it was pretty silly.|- Aunt Maria's right.
{36941}{37001}Whoever he is,|he'll have to do better than that.
{37005}{37059}Let me see the card, Maria, please.
{37100}{37164}- What are you two whispering about?|- Well, l...
{37168}{37240}I was saying that if that note|didn't warm Maria's heart...
{37244}{37319}...the next one, I believe,|may well start a flame within her.
{37323}{37396}Why, Eduardo, you remind me|of our courting days.
{37401}{37469}He was always telling me|how I lit a flame in him.
{37473}{37522}Sometimes I wonder|if it hasn't gone out.
{37526}{37580}I'll have you know that|I'm twice the man I was.
{37584}{37662}I would settle for half the man|you were, dear.
{37971}{38016}Here are the love lyrics you wanted.
{38020}{38085}The love songs and|the great love letters of Napoleon.
{38089}{38140}Just put them down and get out.
{38357}{38389}Sorry!
{39403}{39461}Right on time, 5:00.
{39717}{39833}You know, Louise, I'm beginning|to wonder what he's like.
{40375}{40405}She's in love at last.
{40409}{40481}I'm going to wear Tony's ring|where everybody can see it.
{40485}{40554}Now we can be secretly engaged|and tell everybody.
{43209}{43284}- No orchids for almost a week.|- Sunk again.
{43289}{43352}I guess we'd better|put our rings back.
{43438}{43469}Hello.
{43473}{43544}Oh, hello, Papa.|When did you get back in town?
{43548}{43617}Just now. How's everything at home?
{43621}{43689}Oh, we're all right,|but Maria's in the dumps.
{43693}{43760}Maria, in the dumps? Why?
{43764}{43813}She hasn't received orchids all week.
{43817}{43881}No orchids all week?|How stupid of me!
{43885}{43965}I mean, tell her, of course, that|no one's been making a fool of her.
{43969}{44014}No, don't tell her anything.
{44025}{44092}Well, how does she know|the orchid sender didn't get sick?
{44096}{44201}Well, say hello to your mother.|See you soon. Goodbye.
{44451}{44522}Dearly beloved...
{44551}{44661}...although I have been|desperately ill...
{44672}{44722}...in my delirium, they...
{44726}{44857}In my delirium,|they told me I asked only for you.
{44906}{45013}Have you got my number?|3790.
{45039}{45087}This time, he's shaving.
{45091}{45155}No, don't bring|a lottery ticket in here.
{45159}{45213}I can escape to the lobby|for a moment.
{45217}{45306}- I'll see you there. Right now.|- Did you give him my message?
{45310}{45400}Yes, and he said to have you arrested|for trespassing if you came in again.
{45404}{45480}Mr. Davis, give up.|He'll never see you.
{45484}{45567}{y:i}Fernando. Send a bellboy|{y:i}in here immediately.
{45969}{45999}Mr. Acuna?
{46003}{46049}There's money|and a note on my desk.
{46053}{46101}Take them,|buy two magnificent orchids...
{46105}{46196}...attach the note, then take the|flowers to my home. Is that clear?
{46230}{46289}Yes, sir. But first, could I see...?
{46293}{46392}Hurry it up! This is an emergency.|And bring back the change.
{46408}{46441}Yes, sir.
{46452}{46498}I'll be back.
{46736}{46783}"Dearly beloved, dearly beloved...
{46787}{46852}...dearly beloved, dearly beloved."
{46856}{46933}- I wouldn't take it so hard.|- I'm not taking anything hard.
{46937}{47045}Beware of note writers who haven't|the courage to court you face to face.
{47164}{47241}Even my clock's slow.
{47321}{47374}No, it isn't. Look, dear. Look.
{47901}{47976}"For Miss Maria Acuna."|Thank you, sir.
{47980}{48064}Thank you with all my heart and soul.
{48092}{48156}You're an angel.
{48400}{48499}Hoist the anchor, Cecy,|we're in again.
{48597}{48684}You know, I think|I've seen him before.
{48801}{48886}Louise, would you be a darling and|pick up the pieces of notes I tore up?
{48890}{48935}Yes, yes.
{49003}{49070}"Dearly beloved..."
{49172}{49221}Jumping blue blazes!
{49225}{49305}Can't you even order a teapot|for that hotel without calling me?
{49309}{49393}Why do I put up with it?|All right, all right.
{49397}{49441}Maybe I can fly up next week.
{49445}{49504}In the meanwhile, start looking|for another profession.
{49508}{49602}One that won't require the use of that|addled fraction of a brain of yours.
{49606}{49657}Mr. Acuna, here's your change.
{49661}{49733}Two pesos, 50 centavos.
{49737}{49816}- What are you doing here?|- I delivered the orchids for you...
{49820}{49897}...now you're going...|- You delivered the orchids?
{49901}{50001}I'm not gonna try to figure out how|you substituted yourself for a bellboy.
{50005}{50076}Mr. Acuna, I've been trying for days|to dance for you.
{50080}{50177}You're the only man who's ever|refused to see my work, and I resent it.
{50181}{50229}Get out of my office!
{50241}{50321}Now, look, this is a matter of pride|with me. I don't like to dance, see?
{50325}{50384}I came down here to get away from it.
{50389}{50426}Shall I have you thrown out?
{50430}{50509}You can't talk that way to me.|Honest, I'm an important guy.
{50513}{50559}Now, you're gonna see me dance|and like it.
{50563}{50594}Oh, no, I'm not.
{50598}{50681}Oh, yes, you are. Take it, boys.|One, two.
{53858}{53951}- Well?|- Excellent. Beautiful.
{53955}{54018}But I don't want it.|Mr. Davis...
{54022}{54119}...you do something to me that results|in the most fascinating dislike ever.
{54123}{54200}- May I make an observation?|- You may make your exit!
{54204}{54303}Mr. Acuna, your overwhelming|graciousness bewilders me.
{54307}{54370}However, I bear no grudges.
{54419}{54473}When you change your mind, call me.
{54477}{54521}Out of my sight!
{54525}{54599}Thank you again for your welcome.
{54753}{54817}You let that jumping jack in my office.
{54821}{54903}You'll pay for this with every drop|of your anemic blood.
{54907}{54970}You nincompoop! You worm!
{54974}{55072}You're fired! Now get out and never|come back, you diddling dimwit.
{55076}{55120}"Diddling dimwit"?
{55167}{55223}Welcome home, Papa.
{55227}{55293}I could have sworn|I heard you swearing.
{55297}{55334}Why, I thought you were...
{55338}{55399}Aren't you looking extraordinarily|happy about something?
{55403}{55464}- I am happy.|- Couldn't be orchids, could it?
{55468}{55514}And I'll let you in on a secret.
{55518}{55589}I know who's been|sending me the flowers.
{55605}{55691}You do? Now, look, darling,|everything can be explained.
{55695}{55774}- What do you mean?|- Tell me what you're talking about.
{55778}{55825}The orchids, the notes.
{55829}{55883}- I know who sent them.|- You do?
{55887}{55952}- Well, you don't seem brokenhearted.|- Well, why should I be?
{55957}{56073}- I'm glad you're taking it this way...|- Tell me what you're talking about.
{56077}{56151}- Tell me who you're talking about.|- Oh, Mr. Acuna?
{56155}{56217}When you change your mind,|I'll be up in Room 920.
{56256}{56352}Oh, Papa, that's who|I'm talking about. He's the one.
{56356}{56406}- He's what?|- The one who's in love with me.
{56410}{56453}- He is not!|- Oh, yes, yes.
{56457}{56523}I saw him bring|the orchids this afternoon.
{56527}{56588}Oh, I remember.|He sang at the wedding.
{56593}{56661}I tell you, he's not the one|who's been sending you the flowers!
{56665}{56759}If he is, he's a pest!|He's not only a pest, he's a dancer!
{56815}{56913}- How wonderful. I love...|- He's not for you! He's out of work!
{56917}{56963}Then you give him work,|for me.
{56967}{57064}Don't tell me you could do anything so|ghastly as to get mixed up with him.
{57068}{57130}And to think I was cool to him|at the wedding.
{57134}{57195}I forbid you|to fall in love with this man!
{57199}{57269}And besides, it's too late.|He's going somewhere.
{57273}{57308}New York, I hope.
{57313}{57394}Well, maybe I can change his mind.
{57413}{57473}You should read what he wrote to me.
{57477}{57562}No. No, on second thought,|I don't think your heart could stand it.
{57566}{57679}- Anybody can write a love letter.|- I'd like to see you try it.
{57683}{57762}Anyway, he's not leaving|South America...
{57766}{57845}...if I can help it.|And I think I can.
{57849}{57939}- What was his room number?|- My mind's a blank. I've forgotten.
{57943}{57985}I haven't.
{57989}{58028}920, please.
{58033}{58089}You ask him to the house tonight.
{58121}{58200}What's gotten into you, Maria?|Nice girls don't act this way.
{58204}{58288}- Nice girls don't feel the way I do.|- Why, you're brazen.
{58292}{58322}How could I be...
{58326}{58385}...with a heart like an ice cube?|- I didn't say that.
{58389}{58493}That gleam in your eye has nothing|to do with ice cubes. It's predatory.
{58497}{58553}Maybe you're right.
{58565}{58621}- 920, please.|- All right.
{58625}{58682}When I've signed those papers,|I'll ask him.
{58686}{58737}You're a very sweet papa.
{58741}{58836}Oh, and I'll have to hurry.|I've only got three hours to dress.
{58857}{58895}Bye, sweets.
{58920}{58926}- Why did you have to tell him off?|- Don't worry, he'll come around.
{58926}{58996}- Why did you have to tell him off?|- Don't worry, he'll come around.
{59000}{59052}Oh, you don't know him.
{59056}{59147}You know, Acuna is the most|opinionated man in South America.
{59151}{59200}I'll show you.
{59497}{59536}See that nose?
{59541}{59616}That nose shows opinionation.
{60025}{60087}His ears indicate mulishness.
{60140}{60230}His forehead slopes like a tin roof.
{60273}{60378}- No intellect whatsoever.|- What about his chin?
{60382}{60453}Oh, his chin clearly indicates|weakness of character.
{60469}{60584}Handlebar mustache,|no sense of humor.
{60588}{60688}His droopy eyelids|indicate he's a dope.
{60693}{60755}Very flattering, Cugat.
{60844}{60929}- Oh, Mr. Acuna.|- The Sky Room is going to miss you.
{60933}{60986}In the meanwhile,|I will speak to Mr. Davis alone.
{60990}{61069}Sure, sure.|Will you excuse me, please?
{61194}{61267}Mr. Davis, I find myself|in an embarrassing position.
{61271}{61332}Think nothing of it, sir.|We all make mistakes.
{61336}{61404}- When do I start dancing?|- You do not start dancing.
{61408}{61460}- Didn't you come to see about...?|- One of my daughters.
{61464}{61586}The one you so gallantly referred to|as the "inside of a refrigerator."
{61590}{61642}But I'm afraid I don't follow you.
{61646}{61710}She thinks you're in love with her.
{61725}{61811}Would it be rude of me to inquire|if there's any insanity in your family?
{61815}{61886}And what's worse, she has the|illusion that she's in love with you.
{61890}{61976}- Oh, my. Poor child.|- It's not her fault. It's yours.
{61995}{62091}- I still don't follow you.|- You took her the orchids, didn't you?
{62095}{62164}Why, I left some orchids|at your door, yes.
{62168}{62245}But what's that got to do with the|idea I'm in love with your daughter?
{62258}{62351}She's been receiving orchids and|love notes from an unknown admirer.
{62372}{62453}- Then she thinks I'm the fellow?|- So you've stirred her imagination.
{62457}{62524}I don't want to stir her imagination.|I didn't write any notes.
{62528}{62587}Don't you think I know that?|I wrote those notes myself.
{62591}{62676}- You? Then there is insanity.|- No, there isn't.
{62681}{62750}All you've got to do is to|let her think you wrote those notes.
{62754}{62837}- I see. Then what?|- Then disillusion her.
{62841}{62897}- Tell her I didn't send the flowers?|- Of course not.
{62901}{62986}Her pride would be crushed. She's got|to believe that you admire her...
{62990}{63086}...and yet for her own happiness, she's|got to lose her infatuation for you.
{63097}{63147}That's easy. Just tell her I'm a heel.
{63151}{63212}I want her to discover that|for herself.
{63227}{63273}Yeah? How?
{63277}{63353}By being your own obnoxious self|when you come to my house tonight.
{63357}{63401}Oh, I'm coming to your house tonight?
{63405}{63443}To complete the disillusionment...
{63447}{63513}...you'll tell her you're sailing|for North America tomorrow.
{63517}{63596}But I'm not. I like it here.
{63604}{63664}I'll pay your transportation|and a bonus as well.
{63668}{63709}Thanks just the same, Mr. Acuna.
{63713}{63783}My only interest at the moment|is in your Sky Room.
{63787}{63883}If you do this for me, I'll give you a|contract to dance, at some future date.
{63887}{63943}Will you put that in writing|and leave the date open?
{63947}{63999}- Yes.|- Okay.
{64003}{64063}- What time shall I show up?|- At 9:00.
{64090}{64160}And don't stay too late.
{64248}{64329}- Something in my eye.|- A keyhole, no doubt.
{64333}{64414}- Until tonight at 9.|- And I won't stay too late.
{64554}{64593}Look what we found.
{64597}{64656}Is this your Robert Davis?
{64673}{64729}That's the one.|He brought the orchids.
{64733}{64780}He's "The Idol of New York."
{64784}{64817}I like his smile...
{64821}{64880}...and the twinkle in his eye.|- Remember Mama's advice:
{64885}{64932}Don't frighten him|with your intelligence.
{64936}{65023}- Just act simple and mysterious.|- I know, make an entrance.
{65027}{65084}Be casual, as though|I didn't know he was coming.
{65088}{65154}That's right. Come on, Cecy.
{65273}{65315}Eduardo.
{65390}{65456}- Do I look all right?|- You're as beautiful as ever, my dear.
{65460}{65519}It just takes longer now.
{65523}{65567}Ouch!
{65571}{65649}Oh, I forgot. I had a pin in my mouth.|Did it go in very deep?
{65653}{65721}I'll probably look like|a Ubangi by midnight.
{65733}{65778}Hurry, it's 9:00.
{65806}{65874}If you giggle again, I'm going to|throw cold water in your face.
{65878}{65943}You think Mr. Davis wants to marry|into a family of gigglers?
{65947}{66019}Maria won't marry this young man.|She's not going to like him.
{66023}{66076}He has absolutely no good qualities.
{66080}{66149}That's not for you to decide.
{66153}{66248}I read in a book that a salmon swims|miles and miles to find a mate...
{66253}{66296}...and Maria has swum long enough.
{66300}{66368}Maria is going to wait|until the right man comes along.
{66372}{66441}Why should she? I didn't.
{66551}{66636}Oh, it's Mr. Davis. He can't meet us|scattered around the hall.
{66641}{66708}- Hurry, Mama.|- Come on.
{66827}{66899}- Good evening, Mr. Acuna.|- Mr. Davis.
{66903}{66963}- Did you receive the contract?|- Yes, sir.
{66967}{67010}Then I can depend on you?
{67014}{67078}Don't worry, she'll be disillusioned.
{67302}{67368}Maria, may I present|Mr. Robert Davis.
{67373}{67450}- We've met before, haven't we?|- Yes. No.
{67454}{67506}That is... In a way, but...
{67510}{67558}We will translate|that remarkable statement...
{67562}{67645}...after you've met|the rest of the family.
{67765}{67833}This is Mrs. Acuna.|My daughters Cecy and Lita.
{67837}{67912}Mr. Robert Davis.|He can't stay long.
{67917}{67992}Sit down, Mr. Davis.
{68161}{68260}I accidentally read|one of your beautiful notes to Maria.
{68274}{68367}It's a shame that such a talented|young man is unemployed, Eduardo.
{68371}{68416}Oh, but didn't Mr. Acuna tell you?
{68420}{68480}I'm to dance in his Sky Room|starting tomorrow night.
{68485}{68565}- Isn't that so, Mr. Acuna?|- The date was left open.
{68569}{68646}- But you meant tomorrow, didn't you?|- Oh, of course he did.
{68650}{68738}And you're going to love|working for Papa. Isn't he?
{68742}{68850}Oh, I'm sure I will.|Oh, I almost forgot.
{68857}{68920}These are for you.|There's no note this time, because...
{68925}{69021}I'd rather you'd say|what you might have written anyway.
{69401}{69490}- Do you mind if I smoke?|- Oh, of course not.
{69494}{69544}No, thank you.
{69649}{69705}Have I said something wrong?
{69709}{69750}He thinks it's real.
{69754}{69825}I had it made|into a cigarette lighter, Mr. Davis.
{69829}{69897}Oh, I see.|For a moment, it looked real.
{69901}{69976}Oh, I guess it's killed|many a man in its day...
{69980}{70027}...but it's only an antique now.
{70031}{70090}But you wouldn't mind|pointing it that way a little bit?
{70094}{70189}- Of course not, but it's harmless.|- Oh, I'm sure it is.
{70290}{70337}Do you mind?|I could stand a little air.
{70341}{70391}There's lots of it in the garden.
{70395}{70446}Remember?
{70450}{70498}- What if I'd killed him?|- Never mind him.
{70502}{70542}What about the vase?
{70558}{70635}Oh, now he'll never get back|into a romantic mood.
{70639}{70728}Maybe some music would|quiet his nerves. Come on.
{70922}{70995}After my notes, I must be|an awful disappointment to you.
{70999}{71035}Oh, on the contrary.
{71039}{71088}I like modest men.
{71112}{71178}Well, I don't know exactly|how to tell you, but...
{71182}{71234}I like bashfulness too.
{71355}{71467}Your city is so cosmopolitan, and this|shack of yours is so magnificent...
{71471}{71548}...frankly, I feel like|a duck out of water.
{71552}{71605}I think you'd fit in anyplace.
{71609}{71692}But I mean, I wouldn't fit into|this kind of life, your kind of life.
{71697}{71751}I don't like it much either.
{71755}{71815}But you don't know my kind of life.
{71819}{71881}- It's music and dancing, isn't it?|- Yes.
{71885}{71961}Well, we love your North American|music and dances down here.
{71965}{72054}Oh, but imagine a man like me|having to dance for a living.
{72058}{72112}I can't imagine a happier way|to earn one.
{72162}{72210}There's a great weakness|in my character.
{72214}{72282}- I'm a sucker for a horserace.|- They thrill me too.
{72286}{72367}I'd probably bet my last cent on|a horse. As a matter of fact, I did.
{72371}{72432}I have a gambler's heart myself.
{72437}{72467}You know...
{72471}{72558}...I think that's why|your notes intrigued me so.
{72589}{72658}Look, little lady,|as they'd say in Brooklyn:
{72662}{72768}"I can't bat in your league." I'm a plain,|ordinary guy from Omaha, Nebraska.
{72772}{72845}Just an old-fashioned,|everyday Middle Westerner.
{72849}{72930}Why, my grandfather|was a cattle raiser.
{72934}{72976}So was mine!
{73005}{73053}But you're streamlined. You're today.
{73057}{73184}Sister, I was raised amongst the|grasshoppers. I am strictly from corn.
{73281}{73368}{y:i}I am not such a clever one
{73373}{73463}{y:i}About the latest fads
{73467}{73565}{y:i}I admit, I was never one
{73569}{73688}{y:i}Adored by local lads
{73692}{73825}{y:i}Not that I ever try to be a saint
{73888}{73938}{y:i}I'm the type
{73942}{74039}- {y:i}That they classify as quaint|- {y:i}Quaint
{74043}{74073}{y:i}That they mother you
{74077}{74118}{y:i}Quaint that they brother you
{74122}{74169}{y:i}Must be another you
{74173}{74228}{y:i}I like the other you
{74233}{74328}{y:i}I'm old-fashioned
{74332}{74421}{y:i}I love the moonlight
{74425}{74472}{y:i}I love
{74476}{74615}{y:i}The old-fashioned things
{74619}{74706}{y:i}The sound of rain
{74710}{74800}{y:i}Upon a window pane
{74804}{74873}{y:i}The starry song
{74877}{75008}{y:i}That April sings
{75014}{75094}{y:i}This year's fancies
{75098}{75198}{y:i}Are passing fancies
{75202}{75312}{y:i}But sighing sighs|{y:i}Holding hands
{75317}{75468}{y:i}These my heart understands
{75494}{75565}{y:i}I'm old-fashioned
{75569}{75644}{y:i}But I don't mind it
{75649}{75770}{y:i}That's how I want to be
{75774}{75918}{y:i}As long as you agree
{75925}{76076}{y:i}To stay old-fashioned
{76080}{76177}{y:i}With me
{79844}{79886}It's getting late, Mr. Davis.
{80040}{80155}- It's your play, Eduardo.|- Well, I don't want that card.
{80176}{80233}Rummy.
{80515}{80597}Am I the first girl you never kissed?
{80646}{80724}I knew a fellow once who came|to a lull like this with a girl and...
{80728}{80775}Yes?
{80779}{80838}He didn't know what to say.
{80855}{80940}I heard of a man once|who was in love with a girl...
{80945}{81014}...and afraid to say so.
{81192}{81243}Cugat. I promised to meet him.
{81247}{81323}I almost forgot. You'll forgive me|if I go, won't you?
{81327}{81406}- Of course.|- I'm awfully sorry. I promised to see...
{81433}{81488}Good night.
{81548}{81601}- Why, he's leaving.|- Good.
{81616}{81667}Mr. Davis.
{81671}{81730}- Doesn't Maria dance beautifully?|- Yes.
{81734}{81776}You should've seen her|dressing for you.
{81781}{81836}No dress was good enough,|even though she has dozens.
{81841}{81926}- Not that she's extravagant, Mr. Davis.|- I'm sure she's not. Good night, girls.
{81930}{81992}When Mama was away once,|Maria ran the house herself.
{81996}{82065}- Papa said the bills were cut in half.|- And what meals we had!
{82069}{82142}- Maria majored in domestic science.|- She did?
{82146}{82221}Everyone remarks on what|a perfect wife she'll make.
{82225}{82296}I agree. Absolute...|If I could just have my hat.
{82300}{82364}- Oh, of course.|- You must forgive the girls...
{82368}{82448}...they're just anxious for Maria|to get married so they can be married.
{82452}{82525}- Well, thank you very much...|- They don't need to worry any longer.
{82529}{82634}- I'd say Maria's falling in love.|- We'd miss her if she left.
{82638}{82699}We'd be willing to make the sacrifice|for her happiness.
{82703}{82758}Thanks. It's been so nice.
{82788}{82852}- Leaving so soon, Mr. Davis?|- Yes.
{82856}{82899}But I hate to.
{82903}{82964}- Good night.|- Good night.
{82968}{83037}- Thanks a lot.|- Oh, you're very welcome.
{83041}{83098}Will you three stop interfering|with Maria's life?
{83102}{83145}Will you leave that to me?
{83149}{83213}- Oh, Maria!|- Oh, Maria!
{83232}{83295}- Isn't he just wonderful?|- How'd you make out?
{83299}{83375}The first time in my life I ever|really wanted a man to kiss me...
{83379}{83455}...and he had something else to do.
{83475}{83539}But the next time,|it's going to be different.
{83584}{83652}Eduardo, did you hear that?
{83695}{83753}- Hi, Fernie.|- Oh, no. Over my dead body.
{83757}{83886}- I'm not going to get fired again today.|- Must you clutter up the doorway?
{83900}{83965}- You betrayed me last night.|- Me? How?
{83969}{84032}By deliberately concealing|your true and obnoxious nature...
{84037}{84099}...and making yourself be charming.|- I did not.
{84103}{84165}Maybe there is insanity|in the female branch of the family.
{84169}{84220}They've conceived|a misguided affection for you.
{84225}{84323}- They think I'm in love with Maria.|- The mention of love between you...
{84327}{84373}...makes my flesh creep.
{84403}{84481}How you can be the father of such|a lovely girl absolutely amazes me.
{84485}{84563}- I resent that remark.|- I resent how you butt into her life.
{84567}{84622}But you have absolutely|no right to resent anything.
{84626}{84697}Mr. Acuna, I've arranged to fly back|to New York by the next plane.
{84701}{84768}- You've what?|- You can tear up that contract.
{84772}{84839}- I've decided to beat it.|- Oh, you have? Just like that?
{84843}{84921}Yes, sir, I'm going to dump|your entire asinine predicament...
{84925}{84976}...right back into your lap.
{84981}{85060}Oh, I see. You want them to think|that I forced you to leave.
{85065}{85109}Isn't that exactly what you're doing?
{85113}{85202}You want Maria to think you're a|martyr, sacrificed on the altar of love.
{85214}{85309}That idiotic statement didn't come|from your wife's side of the family.
{85313}{85373}Mr. Davis, you signed|a binding contract with me.
{85377}{85428}You'll stay here,|or I'll file an injunction.
{85432}{85478}- Yesterday, you wanted...|- That was before...
{85482}{85556}...your hideous display of charm|last night. Now I have a new plan.
{85561}{85616}You will live up to your contract|in the Sky Room...
{85621}{85712}...but you will keep away from Maria.|- Is that supposed to be brilliant?
{85716}{85788}That will let her know that you|merely used her to get the contract.
{85793}{85853}Naturally, then, she will loathe you.
{85857}{85917}That's just dandy. Then what?
{85925}{85980}Then, to show you how little|you've meant to her...
{85984}{86083}...she will immediately fall in love|with a more acceptable young man.
{86087}{86172}One of many whom I will invite|to my home in the immediate future.
{86176}{86263}- You think she'll fall in love quickly?|- Mr. Davis...
{86267}{86368}...I have an instinct about emotional|responses of the feminine heart.
{86402}{86465}Don't you think|I ought to explain to Maria that...?
{86469}{86502}No.
{86521}{86562}- Why, I thought perhaps...|- No.
{86566}{86655}Our mutual aim|is that she loathe you, isn't it?
{86659}{86718}I guess so.
{86790}{86840}- I was just thinking...|- No.
{86845}{86908}You do the dancing,|I'll do the thinking.
{87177}{87264}Fernando, in making out the guest list|for the wedding anniversary ball...
{87268}{87330}{y:i}... I wanna include the most|{y:i}outstanding and charming men...
{87334}{87377}{y:i}... who have ever been guests|{y:i}in my home.
{87381}{87417}Yes, sir.
{87421}{87486}Wait a minute!|I thought I discharged you yesterday!
{87496}{87609}Mrs. Acuna told me to forgive|your display of temper, so I have.
{87613}{87666}I forgive you, Mr. Acuna.
{87670}{87714}Oh, thank you very much.
{87718}{87788}Not at all, sir.|I'll prepare the list.
{87832}{87896}"Mr. and Mrs. Acuna request|the pleasure of your company...
{87900}{87959}...at the 25th anniversary|of their wedding.
{87964}{88016}Fancy dress."
{88021}{88080}I can't believe|it's been 25 years, Delfina.
{88085}{88150}That's because|you aren't married to Eduardo.
{88154}{88228}I might have been|if you hadn't seen him first.
{88233}{88284}- Where's Maria?|- Tennis lesson.
{88289}{88324}But her mind isn't on the ball.
{88329}{88437}She's still trying to figure out why|Mr. Davis didn't kiss her, I guess.
{88441}{88496}- Oh, hello, Fernando.|- Good afternoon, Lita...
{88500}{88595}...Mrs. Acuna, Castro, Cecy.
{88599}{88688}Mr. Acuna sent me with his approved|list of young men he wishes invited.
{88693}{88768}- Oh, swell!|- Let me see.
{88837}{88927}I don't see Mr. Davis' name here,|Fernando. Mr. Robert Davis.
{88931}{89025}It seems that Mr. Robert Davis|is not on Mr. Acuna's approved list.
{89033}{89077}He's the only one on my list.
{89081}{89112}- Hello, Aunt Maria.|- Hello.
{89116}{89170}- Fernando.|- Hello.
{89174}{89234}Do you know why Papa|left Mr. Davis off the list?
{89238}{89309}He said something about Mr. Davis|devoting himself to the Sky Room...
{89313}{89389}...from now, henceforth.|- Thank you, Fernando.
{89393}{89444}You know, we're expecting you|at the celebration.
{89449}{89530}Thank you, Mrs. Acuna.|You honor me. Sweet.
{89534}{89584}- Bye.|- Goodbye, Fernando.
{89588}{89693}I'd be interested in meeting|your Robert Davis, Maria.
{89697}{89752}Well, I haven't a thing to do|right now.
{89756}{89830}How nice. Neither have I.
{89997}{90048}A little faster, Cugie, please.|Once more.
{90052}{90092}One, two.
{90248}{90300}Hold it.
{90434}{90469}Well, hello.
{90473}{90542}- Does your father know you're here?|- No, why should he?
{90546}{90609}- Mrs. Castro, may I present...|- Why, I remember you.
{90613}{90728}- So you're Maria's Robert.|- Yes... Well, I don't know. Am I?
{90732}{90776}Won't you come in and sit down?
{90780}{90840}We are special emissaries|from Mr. and Mrs. Acuna.
{90845}{90929}We're asking the pleasure of your|company on Wednesday evening.
{90933}{90990}- Thank you.|- At 9 p.m., but...
{90994}{91077}...you can come earlier if you like.
{91081}{91137}Are you sure Mr. Acuna|wants me to come?
{91141}{91207}Oh, he'd be devastated if you didn't.
{91211}{91244}And so would I.
{91248}{91333}You were coming back|in half an hour, weren't you, Auntie?
{91405}{91500}Oh, yes, in a half an hour. Goodbye.
{91568}{91645}Won't you sit down?
{91729}{91815}Well, this is a pleasant surprise.
{91819}{91884}We were just running over|a little thing from Harlem.
{91889}{91942}But I don't suppose|you've heard of Harlem here.
{91946}{92017}Isn't that where the zoot suit|with the reet pleat comes from?
{92078}{92112}Yeah.
{92117}{92184}- I'd like to hear it. May I?|- Certainly.
{92188}{92223}Oh, Cugie, let's have it.
{92345}{92397}{y:i}Just heard of the Shorty George
{92401}{92460}{y:i}Got word of the Shorty George
{92464}{92516}{y:i}Seems that it's a kind of jig
{92520}{92611}{y:i}Named for someone about so big
{92638}{92692}{y:i}He rambles around the town
{92696}{92754}{y:i}Preambles around the town
{92758}{92809}{y:i}Then steps on a crowded street
{92813}{92856}{y:i}And beats his feet till his feet is beat
{92861}{92916}{y:i}Watch him go
{92920}{92975}{y:i}And he can
{92979}{93028}{y:i}Like a real
{93033}{93109}{y:i}Natural man
{93113}{93163}{y:i}High stepper is Shorty George
{93167}{93232}{y:i}Black pepper is Shorty George
{93236}{93280}{y:i}He dances to pay the rent
{93284}{93370}{y:i}And to see that you're solid sent
{93391}{93514}{y:i}Say, mister, can you spare a penny?
{93518}{93632}{y:i}Lady, can you spare a dime?
{93637}{93755}{y:i}He makes|{y:i}I don't know how many
{93759}{93864}{y:i}Because he's dancing all the time
{93873}{93984}{y:i}Papa's dressed up mighty sporty
{93988}{94098}{y:i}Mama's snoozing in the shade
{94105}{94204}{y:i}But while Mama's catching 40
{94220}{94300}{y:i}Shorty sees the rent is paid
{94340}{94391}{y:i}Get hip to the Shorty George
{94395}{94455}{y:i}Hop, skip to the Shorty George

{94502}{94564}{y:i}I know you'll beat your feet|{y:i}Until your feet is beat
{98357}{98396}Are you sure he's coming?
{98419}{98452}Does Papa know?
{98470}{98514}Do you think he'll propose tonight?
{98518}{98583}Well, if he doesn't,|it won't be my fault.
{98610}{98646}Maria!
{98851}{98904}My, isn't Papa handsome?
{98909}{98988}Just think, Papa, you've been|married longer than we've lived.
{98993}{99080}Well, I consider that a very fortunate|coincidence, my dear.
{99111}{99147}Maria.
{99164}{99228}It just occurred to me|that I neglected to ask Mr. Davis...
{99232}{99309}...to come to the house tonight.|That doesn't bother you, does it?
{99313}{99375}- Should it, Papa?|- It's just, I thought it unforgivable...
{99379}{99449}...that he didn't call on you|after starting his contract with me.
{99453}{99508}He hasn't sent|any more orchids, has he?
{99512}{99556}- No more notes?|- Nope.
{99561}{99608}- You don't seem upset about it.|- I'm not.
{99612}{99642}Well, that's fine.
{99646}{99696}There'll be some handsome|young men tonight.
{99701}{99740}I want you to have a happy time.
{99744}{99800}I expect this to be|the happiest night of my life.
{99805}{99894}That's a good girl. I knew you'd let Mr.|Davis know exactly where he stands.
{99898}{99964}Yes, Papa,|that's just what I intend to do.
{99968}{100020}Papa, Grandma's here. Hurry!
{100220}{100287}Thank you very much.|Very kind of you.
{100331}{100404}- Congratulations.|- Oh, Maria.
{100591}{100644}What's going on between|your wife and my husband?
{100649}{100702}They're always whispering.
{100706}{100760}This is a fine time|to suspect your husband...
{100765}{100798}...on your wedding anniversary.
{100821}{100864}Well, I don't know.
{100927}{101016}You're such a fool,|and you think you're so smart.
{101020}{101056}Why, Maria actually|seemed happy...
{101061}{101131}...when I told her|I hadn't invited Mr. Davis.
{101303}{101334}Robert.
{101338}{101389}- Oh, Mr. Davis.|- We're so glad to see you.
{101393}{101435}Thank you.|Congratulations, Mrs. Acuna.
{101439}{101520}- It's so nice of you to ask me.|- We're happy to have you, aren't we?
{101524}{101588}- Delighted. Aren't we, Papa?|- Yes, indeed.
{101592}{101625}Congratulations, Mr. Acuna.
{101629}{101689}It gives us all an opportunity|to say goodbye to him.
{101693}{101723}- Goodbye?|- Goodbye?
{101727}{101792}He received an offer from New York,|didn't you, Robert?
{101797}{101868}- Well, that is...|- Insisted on taking tomorrow's plane.
{101873}{101915}Didn't you, Robert?
{101919}{101948}Yes, I guess I did.
{101953}{102014}- Oh, Mr. Davis, you can't!|- We won't let you!
{102018}{102093}I'm sure Mr. Davis|knows what's best.
{102097}{102176}- For him.|- You must induce him to stay.
{102180}{102248}I have no alternative. He asked me|to tear up the contract.
{102252}{102332}- Didn't you, Robert?|- Yes, sir.
{102352}{102397}Grandma wanted to meet you.
{102703}{102777}- Isn't she a lovely girl?|- I've never met a lovelier one.
{102781}{102828}Remember, I have|my own chapel at home...
{102832}{102896}...if you'd like to get married|without the usual Acuna fuss.
{102900}{102936}Granny, we...
{102941}{103012}You don't understand.|We have no use for a chapel.
{103017}{103114}We've just heard that Mr. Davis|is forced to leave us.
{103122}{103204}You chose exactly|the right word, Maria.
{103256}{103370}Our dear friends, 52 years ago|in a little village in Brittany...
{103374}{103426}...my beloved mother|and father were married.
{103430}{103488}When they came to South America|they brought a song...
{103492}{103529}...and a happy tradition with them.
{103533}{103587}This music was played|at their wedding...
{103591}{103648}...and 25 years ago,|at Delfina's and mine.
{103652}{103708}And now, in honor|of my beloved mother...
{103712}{103755}...and in tribute|to my charming wife...
{103759}{103823}...I have asked Mr. Cugat|to play that music for us tonight.
{104191}{104257}{y:i}Listen to the birdies|{y:i}Letting those squeaks out
{104261}{104330}{y:i}Puffing their cheeks out|{y:i}All around the place
{104334}{104406}{y:i}Little hurdy-gurdies|{y:i}Sounding so merry
{104410}{104480}{y:i}Getting so very blue in the face
{104484}{104612}{y:i}Surely there's a reason|{y:i}Everybody's gay
{104616}{104749}{y:i}It must be the season|{y:i}For a wedding day
{104753}{104820}{y:i}Ding-dong dell|{y:i}The bells in the steeple go
{104824}{104885}{y:i}Ding-dong dell|{y:i}Around the countryside
{104889}{104959}{y:i}Ding-dong dell|{y:i}And off all the people go
{104963}{105020}{y:i}Off to kiss the bride
{105024}{105087}{y:i}All the donkey carts are driving
{105091}{105153}{y:i}To the wedding in the spring
{105157}{105224}{y:i}All the neighborhood's arriving
{105228}{105287}{y:i}To see the wedding ring
{105291}{105357}{y:i}Now they're forming in a column
{105361}{105424}{y:i}For the service has begun
{105429}{105545}{y:i}Although the padre's solemn|{y:i}He's the only one
{105573}{105641}{y:i}Down the aisle|{y:i}The page and the flower girls
{105645}{105702}{y:i}In a while|{y:i}The happy bride and groom
{105706}{105781}{y:i}The ladies smile|{y:i}We'll give her a shower, girls
{105785}{105835}{y:i}Dishes and a broom
{105840}{105971}{y:i}All the gentlemen are jolly|{y:i}For the wine is flowing free
{105976}{106102}{y:i}All the ladies melancholy|{y:i}For the days that used to be
{106106}{106168}{y:i}When the carriage|{y:i}That's been waiting
{106172}{106240}{y:i}Takes the newlyweds away
{106244}{106385}{y:i}The crowd keeps celebrating|{y:i}Till the break of day
{106389}{106448}{y:i}Ding-dong dell|{y:i}The bells in the steeple go
{106452}{106519}{y:i}Ding-dong dell|{y:i}Around the countryside
{106523}{106588}{y:i}Ding-dong dell|{y:i}Toast the bride
{106592}{106649}{y:i}Then farewell|{y:i}Off they ride
{106653}{106685}{y:i}Oh, what fun
{106689}{106790}{y:i}Comes under the heading|{y:i}Of wedding in the spring
{107935}{108021}Hey, you've got to make Davis|so jealous that he won't leave Maria.
{108025}{108087}If he takes a plane,|it's gotta be on a honeymoon with her.
{108092}{108131}Will you do it?
{108135}{108196}Well, well,|what are you waiting for?
{108495}{108591}Listen, old man, I started this dance|with Maria, and I'm going to finish it.
{108884}{108918}Go out there and cut in on him.
{108922}{108997}{y:i}Keep after him until he's so jealous|he can't stand it.
{109371}{109407}Help!
{109545}{109623}Mr. Davis, how dare you|attack a guest of mine!
{109627}{109694}- The jester was getting out of hand.|- And getting in my hair.
{109698}{109799}- I will not tolerate this sort of thing.|- It was our fault, we egged him on.
{109803}{109848}But falling in the pool|was his own fault!
{109866}{109941}Everything that happens|in the Acuna family is my fault.
{109945}{110032}I work long hours, I do as I'm told,|and where does it get me?
{110036}{110066}In the end?
{110070}{110166}Oh, so it's you!|You chose your costume well, fool!
{110170}{110217}Mr. Acuna, I have stood enough.
{110221}{110280}Fernando, I didn't know.|I guess it was partly my fault.
{110284}{110367}It's not your fault I'm distantly related|to this fuddy-duddy by marriage.
{110371}{110428}- What was that again?|- You will bark at me no longer!
{110432}{110500}I resign, and don't take advantage|of our family connections...
{110504}{110585}...to try to get me back again.|Fuddy-duddy.
{110626}{110709}Oh, let's tell the truth.|We were trying to help ourselves.
{110713}{110762}We're sick and tired|of being old maids.
{110766}{110811}We wanted|to make Robert jealous...
{110815}{110870}...so that he'd propose to Maria|before he left.
{110874}{110943}- You're wasting your time.|- Well, why?
{110947}{111037}Because I'm not in love with Robert|and he's not in love with me.
{111055}{111116}I think we've embarrassed|him enough.
{111240}{111278}Don't let it upset you, Robert.
{111282}{111363}Maria was bound to come|to her senses sooner or later.
{111368}{111421}{y:i}Kind of settles your problems,|doesn't it?
{111446}{111489}Would you mind|if I said goodbye to her?
{111493}{111543}Not at all, not at all.
{111548}{111583}Thanks.
{111597}{111633}Maria.
{111647}{111691}Why did you say that|to Robert out there?
{111695}{111727}What else could I say?
{111731}{111805}Everybody's trying go push him into|marrying me. Even Granny tried it.
{111809}{111864}If you ask me,|I don't think he needs any pushing.
{111868}{111904}Maria.
{111913}{111966}There's something I've got to say.
{111970}{112066}Take her in the garden.|You can say it much better out there.
{112096}{112176}The air's nice out there, remember?
{112408}{112456}I just wanted to say that...
{112517}{112572}Gee, you're beautiful.
{112608}{112644}It's funny, I had so much to say.
{112648}{112713}And now I can't think|of a darned thing.
{112824}{112855}Where was I?
{112872}{112934}You said I was beautiful.
{112960}{113012}Oh, yes, I did.
{113065}{113175}Look, would you mind turning|the other way, please?
{113182}{113216}Why?
{113241}{113323}I can't concentrate|when you look at me like that.
{113478}{113527}I was only kidding.
{113558}{113612}Oh, you're terrific!
{113705}{113757}What's the use?
{113861}{113994}{y:i}I was never able to recite a fable|{y:i}That would make the party bright
{113998}{114054}{y:i}Sitting at the table|{y:i}I was never able
{114058}{114119}{y:i}To become the host's delight
{114146}{114279}{y:i}But now you've given me|{y:i}My after-dinner story
{114283}{114436}{y:i}I'll just describe you as you are|{y:i}In all your glory
{114473}{114566}{y:i}You were never lovelier
{114570}{114655}{y:i}You were never so fair
{114671}{114760}{y:i}Dreams were never lovelier
{114764}{114837}{y:i}Pardon me if I stare
{114862}{114958}{y:i}Down the sky|{y:i}The moonbeams fly
{114962}{115044}{y:i}To light your face
{115048}{115101}{y:i}I can only say
{115105}{115225}{y:i}They chose the proper place
{115257}{115338}{y:i}You were never lovelier
{115342}{115442}{y:i}And to coin a new phrase
{115446}{115528}{y:i}I was never luckier
{115532}{115620}{y:i}In my palmiest days
{115624}{115736}{y:i}Make a note|{y:i}And you can quote me
{115740}{115820}{y:i}Honor bright
{115826}{115911}{y:i}You were never lovelier
{115916}{116008}{y:i}Than you are tonight
{116028}{116093}Is that what you wanted|to say, Robert?
{116097}{116150}Well, that's only the first part.
{116154}{116211}I don't quite know how|to tell you the rest.
{116215}{116306}Well, maybe I can make|it easy for you.
{116311}{116360}I love you too.
{116445}{116525}Oh, doctor, you've struck a nerve!
{116687}{116771}Well, Robert,|did you say goodbye?
{116775}{116847}Not exactly.|It was more like hello.
{116852}{116911}I can never say goodbye|to her, sir.
{116915}{116956}- I love Maria.|- You don't say.
{116960}{116999}Well, that's just too bad.
{117004}{117043}It would be|if she didn't love me too.
{117048}{117099}That's poppycock.|You heard what she said.
{117103}{117171}Yep, I was there. You weren't.
{117175}{117274}- You're leaving on tomorrow's plane.|- Yeah, but with Maria.
{117278}{117338}You'll do nothing of the kind!
{117348}{117411}Sit down, Robert, sit down.
{117470}{117542}This is going to hurt you,|and I admit, I'm sorry for you.
{117546}{117627}Maria isn't in love with you.|She merely thinks she is.
{117631}{117661}That's good enough for me.
{117665}{117727}- How will she feel when she finds out?|- Finds out what?
{117731}{117771}That you weren't|her unknown admirer?
{117775}{117857}That you agreed to deceive her|in exchange for a contract?
{117880}{117927}Well, that's not a very pretty way|to put it.
{117932}{117992}A woman doesn't mind you lying|when you compliment her...
{117996}{118067}...but she'd never forgive a lie|that made her a moonstruck ninny.
{118071}{118155}She's not. And I haven't been|exactly lying to her.
{118160}{118200}Besides, you got me into this.
{118204}{118293}Did you know that Maria|found a romantic ideal at 15?
{118297}{118335}- No.|- She did.
{118340}{118399}His name was Lochinvar.
{118414}{118463}You don't mean that fellow|on a white horse?
{118468}{118498}A sort of knight?
{118502}{118553}She cherished a dream|that she'd meet a man...
{118557}{118619}...that measured up to that ideal.|- I don't believe that.
{118623}{118656}She's a big girl now.
{118660}{118708}Have you taken a good look|at her lately?
{118712}{118769}At heart, she's still the same|romantic girl.
{118790}{118867}You were just an accident, my boy.|It might have been anybody.
{118871}{118928}Any man who arrived|when she was ready and waiting...
{118932}{119010}...for the lover who intrigued her,|who brought her orchids.
{119014}{119092}There'd come a day when|the illusion I created would vanish.
{119096}{119176}Suddenly, she'd see you|as you really are.
{119182}{119236}And that's...? That's bad, huh?
{119240}{119306}For Maria, yes.
{119321}{119362}Yeah.
{119427}{119458}I'm sorry.
{119462}{119548}I try to appear hard,|but I'm a fake, Robert.
{119552}{119596}At heart, I'm a sentimentalist.
{119600}{119644}I pity you, but I love my daughter.
{119648}{119708}I want to see her happy.|Don't you?
{119712}{119761}Of course I do.
{119782}{119852}If I go north, will you promise|that she'll never know...
{119856}{119947}...that I didn't send the notes?|- I give you my word.
{119951}{120012}It's just that I want her|to remember me...
{120016}{120049}...as she thinks I am.
{120053}{120086}I'll let her keep her memories.
{120090}{120149}As a matter of fact,|I'll compose a farewell note...
{120153}{120222}...that she'll treasure|as long as she lives.
{120254}{120302}It's best that I don't see her again.
{120306}{120352}I wouldn't know what to say.
{120356}{120432}I'll say it.|I'll break it gently.
{120436}{120482}Thank you, sir.
{120680}{120738}We're awfully sorry, Fernando.
{120742}{120782}We didn't mean to get you in trouble.
{120786}{120875}I'm going to insist that Eduardo|ignore his resignation.
{120887}{120917}Oh, Mama.
{120921}{120983}While you're there, will you|put in a good word for Robert?
{120988}{121041}Of course, dear.
{121110}{121145}"Dearly beloved...
{121149}{121235}...as long as my heart beats, I'll never|forget the softness of your lips...
{121240}{121288}...the pounding of your heart|against mine.
{121292}{121340}Yes, my dearest, darling Maria...
{121344}{121440}...I will always cherish the exquisite|torture of our stolen kisses...
{121450}{121499}...our sweet stolen moments together.
{121504}{121600}- Maria, my secret love."|- Maria?
{121612}{121680}You and Maria Castro!
{121684}{121737}Now I know what all that|whispering's been about.
{121741}{121839}- You bluebeard!|- Delfina, give me that note.
{121844}{121941}The "softness" of her...|The "pounding" of her...
{121945}{122028}To think that you,|lovemaking with Maria.
{122032}{122081}The godmother of your own child.
{122087}{122133}The wife of your best friend.
{122137}{122210}Writing a love note to her|on our own wedding anniversary.
{122214}{122266}- You wretch!|- Delfina, I can ex...
{122270}{122325}Don't try to change the subject.|Say something!
{122329}{122373}Delfina, give me that note!
{122377}{122456}I regret having to say goodbye,|Mrs. Castro. You've been most kind.
{122460}{122507}You'd better go into the library,|Mrs. Castro.
{122512}{122567}- Your name is being bandied about.|- What's that?
{122571}{122632}The pistols are on the table.
{122660}{122732}Retribution day is here. Acuna's|going to get what's coming to him.
{122736}{122787}- How? Why?|- He was caught red-handed...
{122792}{122862}...writing a love note to Maria Castro.
{122869}{122906}Maria Castro?
{122910}{123018}- I'm innocent, I tell you.|- Don't touch me, you scorpion.
{123025}{123104}Oh, Juan, we'll have to bear|this disgrace together.
{123108}{123159}And we have grown children.
{123164}{123229}This letter was written to your wife|by my husband.
{123233}{123289}Let the reptile's own words|convict him.
{123293}{123352}We caught him writing it.|He jumped like he was shot.
{123356}{123394}- Did he admit it?|- I admit nothing.
{123398}{123449}You keep out of this!|I'm talking to your wife.
{123453}{123515}I gave him the best 25 years of my life.
{123520}{123559}Do you deny you wrote this note?
{123563}{123618}I ask that my daughters|leave this ridiculous scene.
{123622}{123664}And I demand that they stay.
{123668}{123767}They'll learn a lesson in matrimony|they'll never forget.
{123773}{123844}Eduardo, I am a jealous man.
{123848}{123924}Will you please take that injured look|from your fat face?
{123937}{123991}- Did you write this note?|- Yes, I wrote the note...
{123995}{124081}I'm sure that Papa can explain|everything if you'll just give him time.
{124085}{124195}- Yes, if you'll just give me time.|- Well, we're listening.
{124214}{124253}Well, this isn't the time.
{124257}{124313}And what have you to say,|you brazen thing?
{124317}{124400}My dear, sweet, darling wife,|will you please shut up?
{124406}{124473}I'm not speaking to her again anyway.
{124477}{124552}If you wanted my husband, why didn't|you come to me and ask for him?
{124556}{124590}I don't want your husband.
{124594}{124648}There she goes,|laughing at me behind my back.
{124652}{124697}Beg pardon, Delfina, right in your face.
{124701}{124757}Oh, whispering women!
{124761}{124859}Going to his office every day,|and him, writing letters!
{124864}{124910}- He's a fiend.|- You don't know...
{124914}{124960}...what you're talking about.|- Don't argue!
{124964}{125026}If Delfina says he's a fiend,|he's a fiend.
{125030}{125100}- They're insane, Maria, both of them.|- I am insane, Eduardo.
{125104}{125183}It's an insane world when|my best friend and my own wife...
{125187}{125251}Eduardo, we must confess.
{125256}{125312}Did you hear her?|She wants to confess.
{125316}{125391}We'll confess nothing.|Not here and not now.
{125396}{125498}- You'll have to be patient.|- I'll have to be patient?!
{125510}{125571}Hold that gun.|It might go off, you know.
{125576}{125623}Now, look, I can explain everything.
{125628}{125699}Mr. Acuna was not writing that letter|to Maria Castro.
{125703}{125769}He was writing it to Maria,|his own daughter...
{125786}{125862}...as a farewell note from me.|- From you?
{125931}{126037}He wrote all the notes you received,|and he sent all the orchids.
{126041}{126083}I don't understand.
{126087}{126159}He just decided that Maria|should have an unknown suitor, so...
{126164}{126232}Is that true, Eduardo?
{126236}{126301}You were very considerate, Papa.
{126312}{126395}But how did you come into all this?
{126415}{126507}When I delivered the orchids, Maria,|you jumped at conclusions.
{126511}{126609}So your father had to ask me|to act as your admirer.
{126681}{126779}Well, how did you bring yourself|to make such a sacrifice?
{126784}{126829}The truth is, I wanted this contract...
{126833}{126916}And that's how Papa paid you|for being attentive to me.
{126920}{126988}- In a way, but later...|- Later you got tired of the assignment.
{126992}{127031}You got in too deep.
{127036}{127128}So Papa wrote a goodbye note|for you to send.
{127156}{127248}I apologize for all the embarrassment|this has caused you, Aunt Maria.
{127252}{127303}It was partly my fault.
{127307}{127386}I knew your father|was writing the notes.
{127437}{127529}Well! Everybody knows now.
{127533}{127596}I guess nobody had|any way of knowing...
{127600}{127686}...l'd make such|a complete fool of myself.
{127701}{127745}Congratulations, Robert.
{127749}{127854}I hope Papa paid you well.|You earned it.
{127858}{127898}If I had written the notes...
{127902}{127985}...I would have meant every word|your father said.
{128012}{128056}Please, Maria.
{128060}{128128}He's working overtime, Papa.
{128134}{128193}You should give him a bonus.
{128556}{128598}Will you ever forgive me, Maria?
{128602}{128690}She may, but all my life, I'll be|haunted by your frightful suspicions...
{128694}{128763}...that I could have been unfaithful.|- Oh, Eduardo!
{128767}{128868}Go and see that our guests are happy|and leave me with my conscience.
{128884}{128931}- Eduardo...|- Don't say anything.
{128935}{128986}I know, you're a jealous man.
{128990}{129086}- Remember, I warned you.|- I remember.
{129224}{129299}My boy, a woman's advice|isn't worth listening to...
{129304}{129389}...but any man who doesn't take it|is a fool. And that's me.
{129393}{129464}I've been pretty much of a dope|myself.
{129503}{129551}For some time,|it was a positive pleasure...
{129556}{129598}...for me to dislike you.
{129602}{129659}It gave me a nice, warm glow.
{129663}{129739}But now I must confess that I've|conceived quite a fondness for you.
{129743}{129795}What you just did smacked of nobility.
{129800}{129852}I didn't want to see you|shot full of holes.
{129856}{129917}Making that confession before Maria,|to save me...
{129921}{130007}...it must have been painful.|- It wasn't any fun.
{130012}{130072}Do you think she'll be all right now?
{130076}{130112}Thanks to my meddling, no.
{130116}{130172}I wonder if she'll ever forgive us.
{130176}{130281}Mr. Acuna, would you mind very much|if I didn't take tomorrow's plane?
{130285}{130327}You have my permission|to court Maria...
{130331}{130374}...as long as your strength holds out.
{130378}{130427}But I'm afraid it won't|do you any good.
{130866}{130938}If these orchids aren't out of here|by the time I get back, I'll...
{130942}{130977}I'll set fire to them.
{130981}{131048}Oh, Miss Maria, can't you see|how desperate he is?
{131052}{131113}All right. He made love to you|under false pretenses...
{131117}{131180}...but he's serious now.
{131227}{131279}You've forgiven me.|You can forgive him.
{131283}{131343}I can't forgive him for what he did|to make me love him.
{131347}{131416}What about the things you did|to make him fall in love with you?
{131420}{131495}When you've got a fish hooked,|haul him in.
{131679}{131737}Don't you let another orchid|in this house!
{131778}{131846}- Miss Maria Acuna.|- Right this way, boys.
{132000}{132098}{y:i}These orchids if you please
{132102}{132164}{y:i}With apologies
{132168}{132231}{y:i}And another note
{132273}{132372}{y:i}With these|{y:i}Corsage we bring
{132376}{132436}{y:i}We're obliged to sing
{132440}{132490}{y:i}What the sender wrote
{132494}{132533}{y:i}Quote
{132543}{132611}{y:i}Oh, sí, sí, sí, sí|{y:i}Mama
{132615}{132677}{y:i}See how I love you
{132681}{132752}{y:i}Oh, sí, sí, sí, sí|{y:i}Comma
{132756}{132899}{y:i}Say you love me too
{133148}{133200}Now, don't give up, my boy.
{133204}{133252}You're bucking the man|she thought you were.
{133256}{133307}- That fellow on the white horse?|- Yes.
{133311}{133378}- I have an instinct for...|- For what goes on in a woman's heart.
{133382}{133416}- I know.|- I know this.
{133420}{133505}Every woman wants to be swept|off her feet and carried away.
{133511}{133597}Tell me, just what did this bird|Lochinvar do about his gal?
{133601}{133653}Well, he put on his best|suit of Sunday armor...
{133657}{133727}...and rode up to her father's castle,|or whatever they lived in.
{133731}{133799}There was a dance going on,|or something...
{133803}{133884}...but Lochinvar rode into the patio,|or whatever they have in Scotland...
{133888}{133970}...and swept the girl off her feet,|onto his horse and rode off with her.
{133974}{134015}I think.
{134032}{134105}Well, I've tried everything else.
{137273}{137356}Robert! Robert!
{137380}{137429}Wait, Robert!
{137536}{137603}Before we go any further,|I've got to get something straight.
{137608}{137644}This Lochinvar fellow.
{137648}{137714}Lochinvar?|Never heard of him.
{137718}{137786}Darling!|That's all I wanted to know.

James Connors, you are not Cab Calloway.
We are trying to play
"The National Emblem."
Not "My Heart Belongs to Daddy."
Yes, ma'am.
Well, I guess that's all we can do for tonight.
I think you'd better go home.
Rehearsal's dismissed.
Turn your music in to Willie.
Willie. Here, Willie.
You know, Jimmy, I'm getting to hate these rehearsals. The same thing...
...every time.
- Yeah.
Would you like to stick around and play records?
I'd like to, but last time we did,
I didn't get home until 12.
My dad was pretty burned up.
We could knock out a couple and get home early.
- That's what you said last time.
- We were just practicing.
But my folks think
I practice better at home.
Anyway, Annie's waiting for me.
- Oh, you're dead.
- Yeah. Good night.
Booper, like to try a little classical swing?
Can't do it. My family's out of sympathy with these night sessions you been having.
- See you tomorrow, Jimmy.
- So long, Boop.
Is that you, Jimmy?
Yes, Mom.
What time is it, dear?
Gosh, Mom, I don't know.
It must be close to 11.
Good night, son.
Good night, Mom.
- How was I doing?
- Swell.
Say, I'm glad you're here, Mary.
I wanna talk to you.
- Okay.
- Well...
You know, I don't go around steaming people up.
Oh, no, of course not.
Remember once I told you that someday we might have our own dance orchestra?
- Yes.
- Well, the dog is barking.
- What do you mean?
- I've been thinking it over in my mind.
A fellow doesn't wanna play with a broken-down brass band anymore.
You know, the same:
He gets tired of that.
Instead of the school having a band play a concert once a year...
...why, we could have our own great modern dance orchestra.
We've got everything right here.
We've got the brass, the piano, the reeds and you and...
- Me?
- Sure. You could handle all the vocals.
Oh, that sounds wonderful, Jimmy.
It is. We could make our own arrangements...
...and specialties and play for all the dances.
We could put Riverwood High School on the map.
Now, all we gotta do is to get the school behind us.
Do you think we could sell the idea to Mr. Judd?
- Mr. Judd, the principal?
- Yeah.
I thought the last time you saw him...
Well, I don't think he'd hold my past against me.
This is something big.
Will you go down to see him with me?
- Maybe tonight?
- Sure, I'll go.
- It's a date.
- All right.
- Be right there, Jimmy.
- All right, Mary.
I won't be gone long.
- Hello.
- Hello, Mrs. Holden.
I told mother about the band.
She thinks it's wonderful.
- You do?
- Of course. I think it's splendid.
Doesn't your mother think so too?
Yes, ma'am. She thinks it's great.
Well, I guess we'd better be going.
Good night, Mother.
Good night, Mrs. Holden.
- Good luck with Mr. Judd.
- Thanks.
That was a fib, what you said about your mother.
- Yeah.
- Why'd you say it?
- I don't know.
- You didn't even tell your mother.
- No.
- Why?
Well, I guess I'm afraid to.
Afraid to tell your mother?
Mary, it isn't as easy as you think.
It's not just telling her that we're gonna have a band, lot of fun, lot of laughs.
You see, I've gotta tell her...
I've gotta tell her that this is it, music.
It's my future. It's the thing I want most.
- Maybe she'd understand.
- No, I don't think she would.
She wants me to be a doctor like Dad.
But, Mary, look at me.
Do I look like a doctor?
- No, I guess you don't.
- No, of course I don't.
But ever since I can remember, she's always talked to me about it.
Well, I've agreed with her because it...
I saw that it made her happy.
But now I can't even do that.
Well, Jimmy, are you sure you wanna be a drummer?
Mary, I was never more sure of anything in my life.
You've got to be really sure.
Why don't you wait and see...
...what Mr. Judd says about you organizing this school band?
If he says it's all right, and the first school dance is a big success...
...and you know that that's what you wanna do, go to her and tell her.
She'll understand.
Because she'd realize that your ambition is strong and sincere.
Oh, mothers are like that, Jimmy.
Gee, I never thought of it that way before.
But you're right, Mary, and I'll do it.
Oh, you know, you're so wonderful.
It's a great comfort to have somebody you can tell your troubles to.
You're always wonderful about putting me on the track.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
You know, you're gonna make some man a fine wife.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
And, well, I'm gonna envy the guy that gets you too.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
And, Mary, I'll never forget what a great pal you've been to me.
- Yeah?
- Yeah!
Straight from the shoulder, a real pal.
- Reminds me of a song.
- What song?
"Oh! What A Pal Was Mary."
Yeah!
Yeah.
Jimmy, the band has been a big disappointment.
- Are the boys losing interest?
- No, sir, not in the music.
There are awfully fine musicians in that outfit.
They're just not interested in the stuff they're playing.
When you start playing anything, you've gotta be hopping inside.
Oh, it's wonderful for parades and Memorial Day...
...but people don't wanna sit around and listen to that stuff anymore.
Jimmy, I've been giving it a lot of thought lately, and I'm glad you told me.
The band has cost the school a lot of money.
Maybe we better disorganize it and call the whole thing off.
We're already enough in debt.
Mr. Judd, you just give me 60 seconds of your time...
...and I'll brush that burden off your shoulders.
Go ahead, Jimmy. It would be a pleasure.
Well, I've been talking to the fellows and we'd like to organize...
...our own dance band.
- Dance orchestra?
Certainly. Instead of a brass band, we'd like to have a modern dance orchestra.
Let us go ahead and form this band and give a high school dance instead of the concert.
And I'll guarantee you that within one night, we'll wipe out that debt.
I know it. I've been thinking it over for a long time.
If we don't bring in as many people at the dance as at the concerts...
...in the past 10 years, we'll forget about the whole thing.
Just a minute. You're going to organize a dance orchestra, ready to play...
Not only are we gonna have a great dance orchestra...
...but we're also gonna have a great singer too.
Oh, I see.
- You're going to arrange the whole thing?
- Yes, sir.
Publicity, selling tickets...
...paying off the debt of the band.
The whole thing, all in three weeks?
- In a breeze.
- In a breeze?
You've taken on a pretty large order,
Jimmy. I don't believe you can do it.
Oh, he can do it.
I know he can do it, Mr. Judd.
I'm sure I can do it, if you'll only give me the chance, Mr. Judd.
All right. I'll buy the first ticket.
Oh, thanks, Mr. Judd.
Mary, the principal shook hands with me.
We certainly slipped it to him all right.
- We certainly did.
- There's a great old guy.
- He's a great old guy.
- Vision. That's what he's got.
There's a man that can see over the transom.
- Yes sir, he's gonna go places.
- He sure is.
- You know what that was?
- What?
A springboard. He just launched the biggest ship that ever sailed.
- You're absolutely right. Okay.
- Let's take a short cut.
You know, I misjudged that man.
- Heart, that's what he's got. A lot of heart.
- Here, I'll help you.
- Something's been troubling me lately.
- What?
Do you think "our Love Affair" has enough punch in it?
"Our Love Affair."
Oh, well, now that you mentioned it, Jimmy...
Because I've got a new arrangement on it.
Oh, it's a dynamite love song just made-to-order for you.
I'll play it.
Wait until you get a load of this intro.
I've got some chords that are really out of this world.
Listen.
It starts off a little flairy.
Are you listening to me?
Then it softens down here.
It's violins, you know?
Then the orchestra sneaks back in for the vocal.
Our love affair will be such fun
We'll be the envy of everyone
Those famous lovers
We'll make them forget
From Adam and Eve
To Scarlett and Rhett
Flutes and oboes.
When youth has had its merry fling
We'll spend our evenings remembering
Two happy people
Who say on the square
With fiddles.
Isn't ours a lovely love affair?
Come on, sit down. Try it.
Are you sure you want me to sing with the band? You're not just... of course not, we need you.
You're as important to me as the brass section.
- That's pretty important.
- Try the verse.
Here we are
Two very bewildered people
Here we are
Two babes that are lost in the wood
We're not quite certain
What has happened to us
This lovely thing that's so marvelous
But right from here
The future looks awfully good
Our love affair
Was meant to be
It's me for you, dear
And you for me
We'll fuss, we'll quarrel
And tears start to brew
But after the tears
Our love will smile through
I'm sure that I
Could never hide
The thrill I get
When you're by my side
And when we're older
We'll proudly declare
Wasn't ours a lovely love affair?
I'll learn to bake a chocolate cake
The kind of cake mother used to make
You hungry? Come on, let's go see if we can find some of that cake.
Swell.
I hope there's some left, if Daddy hasn't eaten it all up.
You know, Mary,
I'd never be satisfied with a small band.
I want a great big one. A symphony.
Why, I wanna make American music...
...just as important as any other country's music.
Look at George Gershwin.
Why, his music is as good as Beethoven or Bach, better maybe.
Best of all, it's American.
You like grapes and strawberries?
Can you imagine me conducting a concert in Carnegie Hall?
Oh, boy, what a thrill.
On my left, I have 50 fiddles.
Fifty? That's a lot of strings.
And on my right,
I'd have the violas and the cellos.
Oh, wonderful.
And right in front of me,
I'd have the saxes and the clarinets.
You know, the woodwind is the real body to an orchestra.
Right in back of them,
I'd have the brass section.
Over in the back,
I'd have the bass fiddles. Ten of them.
- Ten?
- Sure, you gotta have a good beat.
Then I'd have the drums and the tymps. Over here.
Oh, you've gotta have those drums in there, Mary.
And over in the back,
I'd have a piano on a platform.
- Piano.
- Make it two pianos.
- Two pianos.
- Oh, I just love pianos.
- And a harp?
- Yeah.
Then the lights would dim down, and I'd come out.
Here, this is me.
I'd tap on my stand for order.
I'd get ready to give them the downbeat.
I'd give the tymps a downbeat like this:
- There you are, Mary.
- That's wonderful.
Oh, that's the way it's gonna be: Success.
- Only...
- only what?
There's just one thing that it lacks to make it perfect.
- Yeah, just one thing.
- What's that, Jimmy?
Oh, you'd think I was silly if I was to mention it.
Oh, no I wouldn't.
Really, I wouldn't. What is it?
- Well...
- oh, Mary?
Yes, Daddy.
Where is my tobacco pouch?
It's on the desk, Daddy.
Well, it's a little late, isn't it?
It's just about that time.
I was just going.
Good night, Mr. Holden. Good night.
- Jimmy.
- Yeah?
- What is it?
- What?
You know, what you're gonna say in there.
The only thing you needed to make it all perfect.
Oh, a xylophone.
- Good night, Mary.
- Good night.
Isn't this a lovely love affair?
Wait a minute.
Hold it! Hold it, everybody!
Come on, fellas, now let's get together!
Dick, you and Leonard have been introduced.
You don't have to start taking a solo.
We gotta play a dance tonight.
People are paying money!
Okay, Jimmy, we'll get it.
All right, then, let's get it.
Everybody, right from the bridge, let's take it again. Here we go. One, two.
How you doing, honey?
Well, I don't know, Annie.
I'm discouraged.
You know, it does something to a girl's spirit...
...to keep on fighting a losing battle to a snare drum.
Well, just keep holding out, Mary.
You'll win.
Gee, Mary, if I were Jimmy Connors,
I'd tell the whole world you were my girl.
Well, that's why all the girls love you, Willie.
But who wants all the girls?
That's great. You play it like that tonight and we can't miss.
That's all, everybody.
Leave your music on the stands.
Don't forget, 8:00 sharp, and everybody with a clean shirt.
Hey, Jimmy, I can't make it at 8:00.
I have to pick up Annie.
You have to pick up Annie?
Well, gee, Jimmy, I promised her and it's a big night.
Are you gonna play a saxophone or keep your mind on the gals?
- You know I'm... It's only that Annie...
- Somebody's gonna have to pick her up.
I can't take any chances on that.
I may lose her.
We're playing for big stakes now.
If we wanna get anywhere, everybody's gotta hang in there.
Well, they tell me that we've just sold our 257th ticket.
Oh, it's wonderful. You see, Phil?
Now, if we only had a good orchestra.
That's what I meant, Phil.
A female mind.
- Why...
- Annie, come here a minute...
...and sit down here.
I wanna tell you something.
Now, Annie, I've got something kind of hard to tell you.
But I'm not worrying about it...
...because I know you're big enough to understand.
Here comes the business.
Now, now, Annie, I'm not gonna be able to bring you to the dance tonight.
- Oh, heck.
- Oh, don't worry about it.
Because I'm getting a friend of mine.
He's not very good-looking but he's loyal.
- Can he rumba?
- Rumba?
Rumba, why, he made it up.
- Here you are.
- Thanks.
I gotta get here early and set up, so I won't be able to stop by for you.
How about it, Willie?
Will you bring Mary for me?
- Well, yeah, sure.
- You don't mind coming with Willie, do you?
- No, of course not.
- Swell, see you tonight.
Yeah, so long.
I always have a wonderful time when I'm with Willie.
- Don't I?
- Yeah.
And I always wind up with a pat on the head.
Hey, Phil. It's a swell gait, isn't it?
Gee, Mary, I feel dandy.
Couldn't we go someplace where we could, well, sort of be alone?
Oh, now, Willie, you be a good boy.
Remember what I told you.
You know, Mary,
I was studying up on Napoleon.
Did you know he was a very short man?
Oh, Willie.
Hey, Booper, who are you waving at?
Annie, you ought to strike oil any minute.
Thank you very kindly, ladies and gentlemen.
And now, we'd like to do our special number for you. It's called the "La Conga."
Oh, yeah, and the vocal will be done by Miss Mary Holden.
In Havana
Every Cubana
Shakes her bandana to
The La Conga
It's a new dance
Something new to dance
Wait until you dance to
The La Conga
Wait till you hear the beat
Of the bonga
Just get that beat
And you'll get the conga
It delights you
And it excites you
And it invites you to
Do the La Conga
In Buenos Aires
In London and Paris
They tango
In old vienna
Their favorite has long been a waltz
In Guayaquil
In Madrid and Seville
They fandango
But in Havana
All the natives go
One, two, three, boom
One, two, three, boom
One, two, three, boom
One, two, three, boom
In Hava-vana
Every Cubana
Shakes her bandana to
Gotta shake around
Watch how to do
- The La Conga
- One, two, three, boom
One, two and three, boom
It's a new dance
Something new to dance
Wait until you dance to
- The La Conga
- One, two, three, boom
One, two and three, boom
- Wait till you hear the beat
- The La Conga
- Of the bonga
- Conga
Just get the beat
And you'll get the Conga
Conga
It delights you
And it excites you
- As it invites you
- To do the La Conga
Conga
Conga
Now you know
The La Conga
- one.
- Two.
- Three.
- Boom.
Yahoo! Come on!
Come on, do La Conga,
Come on, do La Conga
And now you know
The La Conga
Conga
Boom
- Say, wasn't that a swell dance last night?
- It certainly was.
You should have heard what Mr. Judd said.
He said, "We are very proud of the
Riverwood High School's achievements."
- Oh, he's a swell guy.
- Well, did you ever think he wasn't?
Well, I always kind of thought he was a little on the old fashioned side.
Jimmy, careful.
You've been nearly dropping that thing since you were 6 years old.
Listen, Mom,
I've come much closer to it than that.
- Mom?
- Yes, dear?
When do mothers stop thinking about their sons as being a little boy?
I guess never, Jimmy.
That's the fun of being a mother.
Mom, someday whenever you want anything...
...all you're gonna have to do is just ask.
No worries, no landlords, no store.
I'm never gonna stop...
...until you have 10 days of happiness for every one of those tough ones.
You know, Jimmy, parents live through their children.
When you're happy, I'm happy.
When you're successful, then I'll be a success.
Well, I guess then
I just gotta be a great man.
I always thought you would be.
But remember, a great man is only the reflection of a great boy.
In a larger mirror.
Mom.
You're worried about me, aren't you?
Look, you don't have to worry about me.
Because a lot of times a guy does things that people can't understand.
Things crawl around inside of him that nobody in the world can understand.
What is it, Jimmy?
Mom, you and dad, you wanted me to be a doctor.
And after we lost him, you wanted it even more so.
I know what you've done, what you've had to give up...
...to try and help me to be one like Dad.
That's why it makes it so tough for me to tell you...
...that I can't.
I'm so sorry I could almost bawl inside.
But it's just not there.
Why, Dad loved medicine.
He loved every little part about it.
That's why he was such a fine doctor.
And the way he loved medicine, that's the way I love music.
When I'm sitting there at the drums,
I feel as though I'm in the right place.
I feel as though I belong there.
That's what I wanna do.
You want to be a drummer in an orchestra?
Well, that's part of music, Mom.
It's rhythm and...
It's been beating around in my mind ever since I can remember.
I'm sure you'd understand if you'd thought about it as much...
If you only knew, Jimmy, how much we've thought about it.
Why, since before you were born it started.
Your father and I prayed you'd be a boy just for that reason.
And when you came...
...I don't believe
I've ever seen a prouder man.
And to the very end he'd clung to that ideal for you to heal.
And that's such a wonderful thing, Jimmy, in a world that's sick and suffering.
I know, Mom.
I've thought a lot about that too.
But it's the same way in music.
When the music's happy, it makes the people happy.
And when it's sad, they take things out of their lives that made them sad...
...and lose them in music.
And then they feel better afterwards.
In a way, Mom...
...isn't that sort of like healing, too?
Isn't it?
All right, Mom.
I'll be a doctor.
And I'll be a good doctor.
Jimmy?
- Yes, Mom?
- I was wrong...
...when I said that a mother never stops thinking of her son as a little boy.
Why, there's always that time when a mother sees her son before her...
...with a mind of his own, a will of his own...
...and a heart of his own.
And it's then that she realizes...
...whether she's made a success or a failure of her son as a boy.
Just now I saw it.
And I knew that I was proud of my boy.
You could be a doctor, Jimmy.
A good doctor.
I know that now.
But if deep down inside of you...
...your ambition to make people happy with your music...
...is as sincere and honest as I think it is...
...why, that's all that matters.
I'm satisfied.
You're the most wonderful mom that ever lived.
But remember, son, the top of the ladder is very appealing...
...and for my sake be careful how you climb that ladder.
Because that's very important, too.
I will, Mom. I will.
And when I get there, nothing they could cook up would be too good for you.
- You know what, Mom?
- What, Jimmy?
I'm gonna make you a queen.
Wait a minute, you're eating too fast.
You're gonna get sick.
- Yes, you are, you darling.
- Hey, Mary!
Mary. Hey, Mary.
Give me a mountain,
I wanna crush it into a molehill.
- Who's been feeding you vitamins?
- I was worried about Mom.
We had a long talk and everything's fixed, like that.
That's wonderful, Jimmy.
I got the greatest news since the invention of the wheel.
- You have?
- I'm gonna give it to you straight.
I found this in the newspaper. It's been burning a hole in my pocket. Listen.
"Paul Whiteman, number one band leader, now on tour...
...through the cities of the country, decided, due to great interest...
...among the youth of America in modern music...
...to give auditions to high school dance orchestras in various cities."
This is the important part.
"Mr. Whiteman's final selection will be guest-starred on his radio program...
...on June 29th from Chicago."
- That is something.
- Just think what it mould mean...
...if our band made that program.
It'd put Riverwood High School on the front page of every newspaper.
You bet it would.
Suppose we got to Chicago on the 28th and we gave Mr. Whiteman the audition.
We could stay until the next day and play on the radio program.
It would cost a fortune to get that whole band to Chicago.
No, I've figured it out.
To get the band there and back by bus and two days in Chicago...
...it'll cost about $200.
That's if nobody eats heavy.
Oh, Jimmy, that's an awful lot of money even if we have it.
- Yeah, it is quite a bundle.
- But it's not impossible.
When's bank night?
You're pressing.
Say, suppose we went over and we had a little talk with...
- Mr. Judd.
- The school board will do anything he says.
- He was crazy about our band.
- We out to get him...
...while he's in a good humor.
- What are we waiting for?
I'm sorry. And I'm still sorrier to have to disappoint you.
But I couldn't give my consent.
It would be impossible for the school to finance a venture of this kind.
But, if you'd only tell them what it would mean.
The publicity for Riverwood High School and how big it was.
That's one of the troubles.
I'm afraid they think it's too big already.
I might as well tell you, Jimmy.
There have been complaints from parents of the boys in the band.
Interfering with studies, late hours.
No, I'll have to veto this, Jimmy.
Definitely.
Well, I'm sorry to have bothered you, Mr. Judd.
That perfectly all right, Jimmy.
You come to see me any time you want.
- Goodbye, Mr. Judd.
- Goodbye, Mary.
- Jimmy.
- Goodbye. Thanks.
Well, he was nice about it, anyway.
Yeah, but a kind heart will never get us to Chicago.
Well, Phil, there's more than one way of spinning a top.
- Yeah.
- Maybe the school board is content...
...with having Riverwood remain a little red dot on an auto map, but not me.
We packed them in last night.
We gave them a good time after we got them in, didn't we?
- Yeah.
- All right.
I've been thinking ever since we left
Mr. Judd's house how we can raise $200.
- Yeah.
- We've got a terrific band.
It's hot merchandise.
Oh, we'll get to Chicago if we have to crawl on our hands and knees...
...and blow out every lamp on the way.
I think Annie's good and sore.
Yeah, she's really burned up, all right.
Annie. Annie. Annie!
Is that all I get out of you is Annie?
- Aren't you interested in the band?
- Sure.
Don't you realize we only got six weeks to raise the money to get to Chicago?
This is terrific, there's bands from all over the country. This isn't baby talk.
- I'm with you, all the way. You know that.
- All right, all right.
So we've got to raise $200.
How we gonna do it?
How about some punchboards?
Punchboards, sure, sure.
- And we'll give Annie away as a prize.
- Yeah.
- Lf you're gonna be a wise guy.
- Oh, I was only kidding, Phil.
I mean, we got to keep in there punching.
Wait a minute. Why couldn't we make a deal with the Elks Club...
...to give a dance at their Milk Fund Bazaar?
- Well, it's only a month away.
- Oh, they don't give dances at any...
Say, that's not a bad idea.
We could put on our own show.
That'd be different.
We could make up our own specialties, sketches, dance routines.
Great, I like it already.
Say, what's the number one Elk?
- Who is he? The whatchamacallit?
- Mr. Mollison, and he owes my dad money.
- That's our man.
- I'll get after it right away.
Mr. Mollison? Gotta make a list down here, we gotta get costumes.
Cot Mollison. Mollison.
- You know what, Jimmy?
- What?
I think I ought to call Annie.
You're still making valentines again.
When Annie's sore at me, it throws me all off key.
I just can't stand talking to a guy with a one-track mind.
Well, wait'll you're in love with somebody.
You'll know what I'm going through.
Women to me are just people.
- Oh, Miss Hodges, I'm sorry to disturb you.
- It's perfectly all right, Mr. Judd.
I'd like you to meet a new student,
Barbara Frances Morgan.
- How do you do, Barbara Frances?
- I'm delighted to know you, Miss Hodges.
My, what a nice, bright classroom.
Mr. Morgan wants Barbara Frances to finish out the term here.
- I've selected this as her homeroom.
- We're happy to have her.
I'm sure you won't have any difficulty getting into the swing of things.
I'm sure I won't.
- Thank you, Miss Hodges.
- Don't mention it.
Now, let me see.
Where shall we put you?
Oh, yes. Suppose you sit in that empty chair over there.
Thank you.
And if you're happy there, you may keep it permanently.
I'm sure I will be.
- She's touched it up.
- Yeah.
Oh, James, I wonder if you'd take
Barbara Frances to the supply room...
...and help her with her text books.
- Would it inconvenience you terribly?
No, not at all.
Have you traveled very much?
- Me, travel?
- Yes, travel.
Well, a little.
That is, my uncle took me to Chicago three years ago to see the World Series.
Oh, no. I mean the continent.
- Which one?
- Oh, you must see the Riviera.
- Must I?
- Cannes, Nice, San Raphael, Juan-les-Pins.
- Juan-les-pins is simply wild.
- It is, huh?
I met the most wonderful man there.
Almost too beautiful.
But he turned out to be a duke, and you know what they are.
Yeah, yeah, you've got to watch those dukes.
Oh, there goes the bell.
We're gonna be late for our classes.
Oh, dear. And we were just getting to know each other.
You're cute.
Are you going right home now, Mary?
No, honey,
I have to work at the library today.
I had a talk with my dad this noontime.
He thinks he can fix an appointment with Mr. Mollison for us.
He can? Oh, that's swell.
Good work, Phil.
- Well, I've got to meet Annie. So long.
- Annie, so long.
Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy. Looking for me?
Well, no, not exactly.
- Come on, jump in. I'll drive you home.
- Thanks anyway, Barbara.
- I don't think l...
- oh, come on, jump in.
Stuck.
Hey, Jimmy, how's the weather down there?
Get a load of that.
Say, that Barbara Frances doesn't waste any time, does she?
How about Jimmy? He's doing all right.
Just give me the word, Mary, and I'll slug him.
Oh, the county fair, wonderful.
- The fair, are you going?
- Oh, yeah, sure. I never miss the fair.
- I wish I could go.
- Well, why can't you?
Well, I don't know many young people, and a girl can't very well go there alone.
I wouldn't worry about that if I were you. Somebody will ask you.
Oh, Jimmy, isn't that sweet of you?
Oh, no, no, well, I can't...
You're really a dear.
You have the cutest way of saying things.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hello, Jimmy.
- What you doing?
- Just putting these books away.
Gosh, there's an awful lot of them, aren't there?
- Yeah.
- You read them all?
Only up to here.
Mary, about that fair...
What about it?
Well, I thought that you and I...
...we had an understanding that we were going together to the fair.
Well, I got myself all tied up and... oh, there was really no definite understanding that we were going together.
Besides, I'm pretty busy.
And fairs, they're just a bunch of livestock and a merry-go-round.
I've seen all that.
Besides, they're really for children.
Oh, you wouldn't like anything like that, huh?
Oh, I'd like it all right.
But there are a lot more important things in life than going to the fairs with people.
Sure, sure, sure, there are.
I'd better get going. I just thought
I'd drop in and explain it to you.
- I knew that you'd understand.
- Oh, sure, I understand.
You can always count on me, Jimmy.
Just the same as you could your own cousin.
Yeah, and I appreciate it, too.
Well, well, so long.
So long, pal.
Mary, where can I find a copy of Romeo and Juliet?
Back there with the rest of the Shakespeare, on the last shelf.
Thanks.
Where's Antony and Cleopatra?
Right back there, leaning on Romeo and Juliet.
Mary, have you ever heard of a book called Indian Love Lyrics?
- Yes.
- Well, I want to read it.
Well, it's all yours.
It's over there in the poetry section.
I beg your pardon, miss.
I wonder if you could help me find a book.
- What is it?
- The Decline And Fall of The Roman Empire.
Thanks, brother.
It's right over there in the History section.
Thank you.
All the big professors state
That everything should have a mate
Birds and bees and flowers and trees
All have romantic tendencies
So far I have missed the he
That fate decreed was meant for me
I'm just living in a lull
And I'll confess it's mighty dull
Romeo had Juliet
And Louis Xvl had Antoinette
But I ain't got nobody
And nobody's got me
Pelleas had Melisande
And Isabella had Ferdinand
But I ain't got nobody
And nobody's got me
Welch Grape Juice has Irene Rich
Minneapolis has Saint Paul
Abercrombie has his Fitch
But here I am crying
And sitting and sighing
With no one at all
Hans had Gretel by his side
And Dr. Jekyll had Mr. Hyde
But I ain't got nobody
And nobody's got me
- Closing time?
- How did you guess?
- Aren't they wonderful?
- Who?
- Antony and Cleo...
- Yes, yes.
Romeo! Wherefore art thou, Romeo?
Scram, Juliet.
Lancelot had fair Elaine
And Mr. Lunt has Ms. Lynn Fontanne
But I ain't got nobody
And nobody's got me
Frederic Chopin had George Sand
And Alexander had his Ragtime Band
But I ain't got nobody
And nobody's got me
Barbasol has Singin' Sam
Metro-Goldwyn has Mayer
Mary has her little lamb
But here I am hoping and mumbling
And moping with no one to care
Gobs have sweethearts on the wharves
And even Snow White
Had seven dwarves
But I ain't got nobody
And nobody's got me
Nobody
Nobody's got me
All right, buy your tickets for the midway.
We have 52 attractions on the inside.
- There you are. Two. Thank you very much.
- Please, two.
Two more, sir. There you are.
- We have Jo-Jo, the Dog-Faced Boy.
- Two, please.
- Two? Yes, sir. There you are, sir.
- Change out of $5, please.
Five dollars? That's the biggest bill
I've seen here this afternoon.
- There's one, two, three, four.
- Thank you.
Changing the 5.
As I said before, we have a...
He was coming down the street in a hurry when I told him...
...we had to see Mr. Mollison and he just turns to me and says:
"You'll have to take over.
I've got business this afternoon."
Lmportant business, the guy's gone stark, raving mad.
Nothing's gonna keep us from getting the band to Chicago.
- We'll see Mr. Mollison.
- That won't do any good.
Jimmy's the one who can tell him the show we're gonna put on.
If we could only get him away from that fair.
- I'll get him away.
- You'll get him away. When everything...
I can get him to leave the fair.
- You can get him to leave the fair?
- How, Willie, how?
He'd have to, if he ran out of money, wouldn't he?
All right, folks. Come on, now.
Who's next?
- You got to do better than that.
- Missed me again.
That curve's not working at all.
Oh, yeah? Give me six more, and keep track of them.
Thattaboy, Jimmy. You can hit him.
- Hold my coat, Willie.
- Sure.
All right, folks! All right, come on, son.
Do better than you did last time.
Oh, no, you missed it again. Try it again.
Oh, no. You've got to come much closer than that.
You're too far away.
- Would you like hold this for a second?
- Oh, sure.
Son, I got a mosquito in my back yard hits harder than that.
How much do I owe you?
- A dollar and a quarter.
- Soon as I get my wallet.
- Where's my wallet?
- Are you kidding?
Now, I'm gonna get that wallet routine.
Honest, mister,
I had it right here in my pocket.
- Willie! Where's Willie?
- He was here a minute ago.
- Hey, Willie!
- We know how to handle guys like you!
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, mister.
I got the money!
Jimmy Connors?
Jimmy! Jimmy, where are you?
Here. Here! Here I am!
Get me out of here!
- Come on in, start pitching.
- Give him room, boss.
Look out. Hey, don't do that!
Oh, look out!
Hey, Jimmy. The Elks Club is gonna give us a tryout.
They are? When?
Tomorrow, right after school!
Oh, boy. That's wonderful.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Can I see you for a minute?
All right.
Are you very mad?
Yes, I'm pretty mad.
Well, I don't blame you.
I'm sorry, Mary.
Are you very sorry?
Yeah.
She didn't hit you on the head, did she?
It wasn't a she, it was a...
...accident.
But look, Phil told me how great you were with Mr. Mollison and the Elks Committee.
Well, we had to do it today.
You weren't here.
No, I wasn't here.
I was supposed to take you to the fair, but I don't do that.
I take $5 that I saved up to buy music with and I throw it away like I was a millionaire.
I want a great band.
I want them to be a success more than anything...
...and I go rolling off like a rubber tire just when they need me.
Why do I do things like that?
Because you're stubborn, that's why. Just because you got a pair of long pants on...
...you think you know everything. You don't have to go around doing things like that.
- Why don't you tell me when l...
- Me?
You're gonna have to figure out your own problems.
You can't carry somebody around for the rest of your life...
...to keep telling you when you're off the track.
- Can you?
- No, I can't do anything like that.
It's just that, I thought maybe you and me could work...
...in a closer cooperation with each other, that's all.
You mean, sort of like a pal?
No, it's a little more than just a pal.
Well, what I mean is that...
Well, Mary, couldn't you be my girl without...
- Without us getting silly about it?
- Oh, you're...
You're gonna have to work out your own personal problems.
I've got more important things to think about.
You don't wanna be my girl?
Look, from now on, we're business partners.
And whatever work we do together is for the success of the band.
But let's keep very impersonal about the whole thing.
Sure. Sure, if that's the way you want it, Mary.
- Well, then, we gotta move fast.
- Yeah.
Remember the day we were up in the attic looking at those old clothes?
The high silk toppers and long dresses and puffed sleeves?
You thought it would be a good idea to use them in a show.
We talked to my dad, and he told us about the old melodramas?
Oh, yeah, and he told us how the actors used to ham it up...
...with the broad gestures and the asides to the audience...
...and the business with the cape.
But he said that was really acting in those days.
Well, remember that melodrama we wrote...
...but we never got a chance to put it on?
- Sure, I remember.
That's the show
I told Mr. Mollison about.
- You did? What'd he say?
- He thought it was great.
- That's wonderful.
- It's more than wonderful.
Mr. Mollison wasn't just being nice.
He was really sold on the idea.
I know if we do well in the tryout...
...we can get the Elks Club to furnish scenery and costumes.
Gosh. Do you think we could?
We gotta knock them right off their feet.
It's laying right in our lap.
You could play Nell.
You play Mr. Goodpenny, who falls in love with me.
He's supposed to be handsome but you could use makeup.
- Sure.
- Who's gonna play the villain?
- The what?
- The villain.
I know. Phillip, with that trick laugh of his. You know:
- He'd be a natural for Squire Poultice.
- That'll be great.
- And who gets to play La Belle Francais?
- La Belle Francais...
- Has to be blonde and giggly.
- Yeah.
A glamour girl. Thinks all the men are madly in love with her.
- That's it.
- What's the matter with Barbara Frances?
- No. No, no. Not in my show.
- Wait a minute, fella. Our show.
Look, she's just the type.
She's going play the part.
She is, huh? All right, but it's gonna be awfully embarrassing.
This is a show we're putting on.
It's gotta be the greatest that ever hit Riverwood.
You're right, Mary.
We've got to have a great show with a million laughs and color.
And a lot of lights to make it sparkle.
And songs.
- Wonderful songs with you selling them.
- It'll be wonderful.
And after we get the people in that hall we got to start them laughing.
Can't you just see it, Mary?
The people are just packing in.
Why, there's not a seat left in the house.
Why, the overture's starting and the house lights are going down.
- We're ready to go.
- On stage.
- Lights. Music.
- Curtain!
Let's be gay in the way they were gay
In the dear gay '90s
Be naive, wear your heart on your sleeve
For the golden days
When life was gay and charming
But with great propriety
Great propriety
And grandmamma was horrified
If grandpa saw her knee
Men should never see a knee
Give a cheer for each dear souvenir
Of the dear gay '90s
Drink a toast to the ghost
Of the most delightful years
When home sweet home
Didn't know discord
And a cad was someone to be abhorred
And virtue was its own reward
In the gay, gay
The terribly gay
The horribly gay
Gay '90s
Walking down Broadway
The festive gay Broadway
The okay thing on Saturday
Is walking down Broadway
The lady on your arm
Is full of grace and charm
And life is very, very gay
While walking down Broad...
Stop. Do not make fun of this simple country lassie.
She may be somebody's mother.
Or somebody's sister or somebody's...
Stop. You're just as cruel.
And even though
I may have erred in my ways...
I am more to be pitied than censured
I am more to be helped than despised
I am only a lassie who ventured
On life's stormy path, ill-advised
Do not scorn me with words
Fierce and bitter
Do not laugh at my shame and downfall
For a moment just stop and consider
That a man was the cause
Of it all
I beg your humble forgiveness, miss.
Never again shall I insult a lady when she is down.
Adieu.
Alas, this is the end.
Why, it's Miss Nelly from New Rochelle.
Fancy meeting you here, my dear child.
Squire Poultice. Fancy meeting you here.
Even though I know you may be a villain...
...'tis still most warming to see a friendly face from my old home town.
New York is indeed a cruel and unfriendly city.
Alas, I have not eaten for five days.
What a pity, my child.
Come with me. What you need is some champagne and caviar.
Merciful fate, guide me in this crucial crisis.
Methinks there is something rotten in Denmark.
The old codger has intentions on the poor child which are not altogether honorable.
I shall be on the qui vive for foul play.
And now, my pretty pet, do you not feel better?
I have misjudged you, Squire Poultice.
You are indeed a very kind man.
Shall we have a demitasse?
- A demitasse? I might have known.
- Nelly, I love you.
Stand back, villain, go your way.
For I will no longer stay.
And face the vile temptations
That you hurl
You may tempt the upper classes
With your villainous demitasses
But heaven will protect
The working girl
Nelly. Nelly. I love you.
Oh, no. No. A thousand times, no.
Help, help. Save me.
Curse you, Merriwether Goodpenny.
My hero, how can I ever repay you?
By forgiving me for being a cad.
I do forgive you, a thousandfold.
My heart is bounding like the surging sea.
Wait. Would she think me impetuous if I asked her for a tryst?
I'll risk it.
Miss Nelly, may I hope to see you again on the morrow?
Silly headstrong youth.
Shall we say the park?
- At 3?
- Until 3, then, at the park.
Adieu. Adieu.
- Adieu.
- Adieu.
But heaven will protect
The working girl
The working girl
It has been three years since Merriwether and I were made one.
And fate has blessed us with this lovely child.
I thank you, kind fate...
...for having guided my footsteps from the gutters of ignominy.
Oh, baby.
- Nelly. My wife.
- My husband.
Why do you hang your head in shame?
Would that I could die here, I sullied her pretty brow with such sordid news.
Nelly, the mortgage is due, and alas, I have no money.
Oh, shame. Oh, agony.
'Tis the squire, Nelly. Be brave.
Well, my pretty doves, we meet again.
'Tis the end.
No, Merriwether. No. Not yet.
Where there's life, there's hope.
Here, take this ring and pawn it.
- No, Nelly, 'tis your wedding ring.
- This is no time for sentiment.
Run, Merriwether.
Now, Squire Poultice, until this house belongs to you...
...you are not welcome in it. Scram.
Curse you, Nelly Newcombe.
But you have not heard the last of me.
I'll get you yet.
Here's your lemonade, sir.
Nice of you to invite me for a refreshment on such a hot day.
- Little does he know.
- This lassie, awfully clever.
With this, we'll work the trick.
Good. Good.
Come on, Squire Wire, old boy, let's you and I have another little drink, huh?
- Merriwether!
- It's my wife.
Father, dear Father
Come home with me now
The clock in the steeple strikes
One
You said you were coming right home
With the dough
As soon as Ma's ring you did pawn
Come home, come home, come home.
My baby.
Please, Father, dear Father
My boy, Squire.
Come home
My little boy.
My baby.
So.
You've been spying on me, huh?
Merriwether, you've been gone for two years.
Where is the money?
Money? What money are you talking about, Nelly?
The money for the mortgage.
What happened to the money for the mortgage?
Your husband's bought rum with the money, madame.
Then all is lost.
Now, I'll teach you to meddle in my affairs.
Benny, my child. Benny.
You brute. You brute.
- No, Nelly, wait a minute.
- To strike the baby.
- Where's he going?
- Benny, my child.
You killed our baby.
Unkind fate, this is too unfortunate.
Look. Go on. Get out of here, Nelly.
Go on, Nelly! Get out of here.
What have I done? My wife gone.
My little baby gone. My home gone.
Oh, shame, shame.
How about a slug of white lightning, partner?
Well, I don't mind if I do, Miss...
No. Take that vile stuff out of my sight forever.
I must redeem myself in the light of heaven...
...and save my Nelly from a fate worse than death.
You fiend incarnate.
You snake in the snow.
Now, Miss Nelly,
I have come to help you.
If you will marry me,
I can give you the niceties of life...
...that you so richly deserve.
Perhaps it would be better than suicide.
- But I do not love you.
- My riches will make you love me.
Now, just sit down here, my pretty pigeon...
...and sign this paper.
- Sign.
- Hark. Methinks I hear dog barks.
Hold those dogs.
Just in the nick of time.
Stop, Nelly. Do not sign those papers.
The old fox is up to his old tricks.
- My husband.
- My wife.
Curses. Curses.
Foiled again. But no. Not yet.
Quasimodo!
Tie them up and make sure the pretty doves can't get away.
Mr. Goodpenny has an engagement at the sawmill.
Mercy, Squire.
- Will you marry me?
- No. I'd rather die.
Then die you will, my pretty pet, on the railroad tracks.
The railroad tracks? This is the end.
Father, dear Father
Come home with me now
The clock in the steeple strikes
Two
Mother is tied to the railroad tracks
And the sawmill is going to get you
Save me. Oh, save me. Save me.
My boy, you saved my life.
Where is your mother?
- Tied to the railroad tracks.
- Oh, then we must be off!
There they go. After them.
I gotta be going, Dad.
I got a date with a dream. So long.
So long, son.
Help. Help. Save me!
Help. Help me!
- I'll save you, my dear.
- Save me.
Here comes the train.
- My hero.
- Love triumphs over all.
Hey, let me down.
- Hey, we forgot Willie.
- Let me down.
It's Willie up there!
Pull him down.
Weren't they splendid?
Wonderful.
I don't know how they've done it.
Come and help me with the refreshments.
Why, I wouldn't miss it for the world.
- Hurry up, will you, Phil?
- I'm hurrying. Hold still.
Hold still.
What's the matter?
I socked my arm when they pulled me up the last time.
They yanked the line too hard and I felt like
I was going through with wall.
- Here, let me take a look at it.
- No. No. Leave it alone. It's okay.
- Just a little sore, that's all.
- You were great, Mary.
- Thanks. You were swell too, Jimmy.
- Thanks.
You're coming over to the house?
- I'd like to. That is, if you're not too tired?
- Oh, no.
- You've got to take good care of yourself.
- I will.
Hey, Jimmy.
Have you seen Mr. Mollison yet?
No. But don't worry about it.
I won't leave until I get the $ 150.
Thattaboy.
Oh, great, Barbara Frances. Terrific.
- Yeah, you were very good, Barbara.
- Thank you. You're so very kind.
I have my car, Jimmy.
Could I drive you home?
We were all going over to Mary's and...
- Well, fine. Then I'll drop you off.
- But you don't have to...
- Hey, Jimmy. Jimmy Connors.
- Why, here I am, sir.
Here's your check for $ 150.
And you certainly deserve it.
This was the finest show we've had in Riverwood.
Thanks, Mr. Mollison. We appreciate it.
Looks like we're on our way to Chicago.
- You bet we are.
- Lf we can dig up $50 more.
Here we come!
Well, goodnight.
I'm sorry you can't come in.
We won't be late.
We're only having a few refreshments.
Thank you, but I'm expecting my mother and father back from New York.
- I really must run.
- I'm sorry. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Barbara.
Jimmy, could I see you a minute?
Dad's giving me a party at the country club next Saturday.
Will you come?
Why, I'd love to.
That's if I'm gonna be in town.
Oh, I'm so glad.
The only trouble is, I haven't been able to make up my mind about the music.
- You mean, you haven't hired a band yet?
- No.
- But I must decide before I see my father.
- Sure, you do.
Well, maybe I could help you decide.
You might drive home with me and talk to Dad. He'll be there.
- I hate to spoil your evening, but...
- oh, no, no. Not at all.
See you later. I've got some important business to attend to.
Hey, Willie, take care of Mary, will you?
Slide over.
But, Jimmy.
Some birds just gotta be shot twice before they stop flying.
I knew that blonde was a Jonah the moment I saw her.
Would you and Annie go on inside?
I got something to say to Mary.
- What's the big secret?
- Come on, Squire, let's have a demitasse.
Mary?
What is it, Willie?
There's something I've wanted to ask you for an awful long time.
Yes?
Whenever I had the opportunity,
I never had the courage.
Whenever I had the courage,
I never had the opportunity.
Now I got both.
Willie, what is it?
Will you marry me?
I don't expect you to give me an answer right away.
- Well, but, Willie...
- It isn't as if I just met you.
I remember the first day I saw you.
You were wearing gym bloomers.
I was just getting out of Julius Caesar and you were laughing.
Oh, Willie, you're the cutest...
I know I'm not the best-looking guy in town...
...but I'll always love you and I'll be true to you...
...and I won't go out with other girls.
Oh, Willie.
That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me in my whole life.
And I'm very grateful.
But I'm much too young to think of getting married.
Of course I'm not in any particular hurry.
- Willie, how old are you?
- Thirteen going on 14.
- Willie.
- Yes, ma'am?
Your mother phoned and wants you home.
She says it's time for you to go to bed.
Goodnight, Willie.
Goodnight.
- This is my favorite room in the house.
- It is?
Someday, I'm gonna have an enormous yacht.
- Wouldn't you love to go to the South Seas?
- Yeah, it might be nice in the wintertime.
There aren't very many good-looking boys in this town, are there?
Here, Jimmy, drink this.
- All right now?
- Yeah.
Just got my pipes tangled up.
You know, Jimmy, when I look back and remember...
...the thousands of dates I've had with so many different boys...
When I think of the time I've wasted, the empty hours...
- I wouldn't say that.
- James.
Do you really want to kiss me?
- Barbara?
- Who's that?
It's Mother and Dad. They're back.
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, Mother.
- My dear.
- Hello, Dad.
Hello. Well, what's this?
Another young man?
I want you to meet a very talented musician...
...and one of my dearest friends,
James Connors.
- How are you?
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- Mrs. Morgan.
What do you play, young man?
I kind of mess around with the drums a little bit.
James has the most wonderful orchestra in the whole world.
And he's volunteered to play for my birthday party for only $50.
- Isn't that wonderful?
- Well, that's very nice of you, Mr. Connors.
But, Barbara,
I wish I'd known about this before.
- Why, Dad?
- I'm afraid I've made other arrangements.
But, Dad, I promised James.
We play fine music, Mr. Morgan.
We do an awfully good job.
Well, I'm sure of that, son.
But I've already signed the contract.
- Oh, I see.
- But we want you to come to the party.
Especially if you're a musician, then you can bring your whole orchestra.
That's kind of you. I don't know whether we can make it or not, but we'll try.
- I hope so.
- How about a Coke, young man?
- Thanks.
- We'll get to your band. Market's going up.
- Going to have a lot of parties.
- Sure.
Now, don't you worry about it.
And we wanna have you try and be there.
It isn't every day you get a chance to hear Paul Whiteman.
- Paul Whiteman?
- Yes.
- He'll be winding up his tour near here and...
- Paul Whiteman, here?
Yes. We had a hard job getting him but I have a lot of good friends.
Paul Whiteman in Riverwood?
Oh, thanks. Thanks. We'll be there.
Just try and keep us away.
Paul Whiteman. Paul Whiteman.
Well, goodbye, every...
Pardon me.
Glad to have met you, Mrs. Morgan.
You too, Mr. Morgan. I mean, Mrs. Morgan.
You know what I mean anyway.
Sorry. Thank you. Thanks a lot.
Goodbye. And we'll be there too. Yes, sir.
In behalf of Mrs. Morgan and myself...
...I want to welcome all of Barbara Frances' friends to her 18th birthday party.
We also want to welcome
Mr. Whiteman and his band.
And tell them we are glad to have them with us.
Thank you, Mr. Morgan, and we're mighty glad to be here too.
And now, I want you to have the very best of good times.
Paul, it's all yours.
- Say, your old man's all right.
- What did you expect him to be?
- How about this dance, Mary?
- Thanks, but I'm wondering about Willie.
- You haven't seen him dancing, have you?
- I haven't.
Last time I saw him he was hanging around on the porch.
Well, thanks. I think I'd better go find him.
He's kind of shy, you know.
We want him to have a good time, don't we?
Oh, sure we do.
They certainly are swell.
But we've got just as good a brass section.
Just as loud anyhow.
Yeah, only they push the valves down at the same time.
Hello, Willie. What are you doing out here?
- Nothing.
- Well, come on inside and let's dance.
No, thanks.
You've acted awfully funny ever since the night of the show.
Is there anything wrong?
I got things on my mind.
Well, I won't bother you then.
Willie, you're not mad at anything, are you?
- No, I'm not mad.
- That's swell.
- Willie, what's wrong?
- Just my arm. It hurts something awful.
- Your arm?
- Don't, please. Don't touch it.
Willie, maybe you should go home.
I don't wanna miss all the fun.
Have you seen a doctor?
- They don't know nothing.
- Willie, that's very foolish.
If there's something wrong, you should have it looked at.
Promise me you'll go see a doctor tomorrow morning.
Okay, I'll go, but it won't do any good.
But nevertheless, you promised.
Yeah.
Well, let's go on inside and watch, huh?
Come on.
Hey, kids. I just met Paul Whiteman.
- You did?
- Swell, Phil.
Hey, Jimmy, take a load of that tenor sax.
No wonder he can make it moan.
He didn't win that clarinet at a raffle either.
Gosh, I'd sure like to take a feel of those sticks.
- It wouldn't hurt anybody, would it?
- No, go ahead, Jimmy.
Go ahead. Sure. Go on.
- Oh, gee, do you think he should?
- Sure, why not? It can't do any harm.
Oh, I don't know.
- Hey, Leonard, what a set of skins.
- Yeah.
Gosh, with a set of drums like these, a guy could get in the White House.
Boy, if I owned this,
I'd just sit around all day and look at it.
Beauty.
Just as easy.
- Look, Jimmy. Isn't this a honey?
- Gosh, it sure is.
- Gee, I never felt more in the mood.
- Me neither.
Say, it wouldn't do any harm to knock out a couple, would it?
- No.
- No, it wouldn't.
- What are we waiting for?
- Just a downbeat.
Well, all right then, let's get ready.
Sid, get over at the piano.
One, two.
There's a boy down on our street
Plays the drums with such a beat
You cannot control your feet
When you hear the drummer boy
In the morning when you wake
You can hear him take a break
Soon the whole street starts to shake
When they hear the drummer boy
Bing bang, ding dang
He's so nimble on the cymbal
Bing bong, ding dong
When he plays 'em he just slays 'em
All your troubles fly away
Every day's a happy day
Everything will be okay
When you hear the drummer boy play
Say, it looks like somebody's kind of taken over here.
- Yeah, and not bad either, Pop.
- You're telling me.
Gather 'round, all you chums
Watch this cat spin those drums
Swing it, brother, beat that hide
Take us on a jivin' ride
This is what the doc prescribes
For a case of jibs and jibes
Drummer boy please give out
On those vibes
Hear that drummer boy play
Goldie, you boys go on ahead.
- I'll meet you at the hotel.
- Right, Pop.
Come in.
You wanted to see me?
Sure. Come on in.
My name's Connors.
- I know. Mine's Whiteman.
- Yeah.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.
I guess I ought to apologize for barging up there and taking over like I did...
...but we wanted to give you an audition for your contest.
It was a good audition.
How long you been playing the drums?
Ever since I was a kid.
- You're through school?
- Yes, sir. I've just graduated.
- Well, I bet you're mighty happy about that.
- Well, I made it, but I had to slide.
What are you going to do next?
Keep on pounding the drums as long as anybody will listen to me.
Jimmy, you're a mighty talented young fellow.
And I think I ought to do something about it.
One of my boys, a swell saxophone player and a mighty fine fellow...
...is starting his own band in New York.
They open Thursday.
The drum spot's open.
How'd you like to have that job?
Oh, you're kidding me.
They open Thursday.
You'll have to be there if you want the job.
I want the...
New York.
Yeah.
Yeah, why, I could go home and pack right now.
Wait a minute, Jimmy. Don't get excited.
I'm not excited.
Who's excited, Mr. Whiteman?
Think it over and let me know in the morning. I'm at the Wentworth.
The Wentworth?
Well, I don't have to think it over.
I could just have to tell my mom.
Well, I could phone you the first thing in the morning. Say, about 7:30?
That's okay but I think
10 would be a little better.
Ten o'clock. Oh, gosh.
Thanks a lot, Mr. Whiteman. Gee.
- You're on the level?
- Sure I'm on the level, Jimmy.
Oh, gosh. Well, thanks.
I'll phone you the first thing in the morning.
Good night.
Hey, Mom. Mom!
Mom. Mom, you awake?
- Jimmy, what on earth...?
- It's happened. I told you it would.
We're on our way. I've got a job.
- Job? What do you mean?
- Mr. Whiteman heard our band tonight.
Paul Whiteman. He's offered me a job with an orchestra in New York.
All of our troubles are over.
Jimmy, I'm so glad for you, son, and I'm so proud.
Oh, gosh, Mom, just think of it.
New York.
Oh, that's right.
You said you'd be going to New York right away.
Yeah.
Have you told Mary and Phillip?
Well, I thought I'd wait until I got the whole thing set.
- I've got to see Mr. Whiteman tomorrow.
- I wonder what they'll say.
Why, they'll...
- Why?
- And the band.
Everybody's looking forward so to going to Chicago.
Everybody's been working so hard.
Working for the whole group.
- I know what you're thinking but...
- Do you?
I remember when you started the band.
When you told me that they believed in you, had faith in you to stick by you.
And what suddenly happens to them now?
They're the same people.
But this is my one big chance.
I can't give it up. Don't ask me to.
You'd be climbing the first rung of the ladder.
By walking out on your friends.
Yeah, I...
I know it now.
I guess I just didn't stop to think.
I thought it'd be wonderful for both of us.
And so it can be, Jimmy.
But not quite so fast.
Where are you going, son?
You know where I'm going.
So I'm afraid I won't be able to accept the job, Mr. Whiteman.
I thought I could, but I just got through talking to my mother and...
Well, she straightened me out on a few things.
Mothers have a knack at that sort of thing, don't they, Jimmy?
Yes, sir. You know, ever since you made that announcement...
...about a guest appearance on your broadcast...
Why, that's been our ambition.
We played dates.
We even gave a show to try to raise enough money to get to Chicago...
...to give an audition.
But that's before we knew you were coming here.
Jimmy, did you form that band?
Yes, sir.
I kind of cooked it up.
But I can't very well pull out on them now.
That's good enough for me.
Jimmy, let me tell you something.
When I started out, a band was a bunch of boys with instruments...
...who got together and beat out rhythm for the rest of the folks to dance to.
But now it's a profession, and a mighty important one.
Take the big bandleader of today.
He's almost a household word.
He's as well known as your biggest picture actor or baseball player.
Fred Waring, Kay Kyser, Glenn Miller.
All very popular.
But once they were a little guy called Jimmy Connors who...
...just sort of cooked things up.
But with this popularity comes a great responsibility.
Rhythm can either excite the worst in us or bring out the best.
Take that little fellow on the street.
Teach him to blow a horn and he'll never blow a safe.
You know, rhythm is really a wonderful thing.
Sometimes I think rhythm almost runs the world.
In a little baby, the first thing that starts is his rhythm. His little heart starts to beat.
And every different city has a different kind of rhythm.
In your car, if the engine's missing and jerking...
...or you feel the bump of a flat tire, rhythm tells something's wrong.
And if you call a doctor, the first thing he does is check your rhythm.
He feels your pulse to find if your rhythm is solid and your beat's strong.
So, Jimmy, when we get to the last eight bars of the big tune...
...and the old ticker kind of slows down...
...no matter what's wrong with us, the last thing to stop is our rhythm.
After listening to a lot of bands all over the country...
...I don't think it would be fair to select one and give them the guest spot on that show.
No, there's too many good ones.
I've put up a $500 prize...
...and I'm gonna devote my whole program for a high school band contest.
I'm going to play it safe.
I'm gonna let the public worry about who's best.
Gosh, that sounds terrific, Mr. Whiteman.
I've already selected three bands, but I think I'll make it four.
Do you want to try?
- Do we?
- Chicago, Saturday night.
- Will you be there?
- Why, you couldn't keep us away.
- Well, what's the matter, Jimmy?
- Oh, I...
I forgot, Mr. Whiteman.
It's gonna cost us $200 to get the band to Chicago.
I've figured it out.
We've only got 150.
Mr. Whiteman, do you think you could see your way clear to give me a loan of $50?
I'll give you my personal note.
Well, what have you got for collateral, Jimmy?
Well, I could put up my drums.
They mean more to me than anything in the world.
You'd really do that, Jimmy?
Yes, I would, Mr. Whiteman.
- It's a deal. There you are.
- Oh, gosh.
Thanks. You won't have to wait long, not if there's a $500 prize.
I wouldn't be too confident.
You might get a little competition.
We're not afraid of a bunch of kids from high school.
- Hurry up, you're late.
- Is everybody here?
- Music hasn't been passed out.
- Where's Willie?
- He isn't here.
- I'll scalp that midget.
- Run over the old ones.
- Jimmy!
Mrs. Brewster phoned, Willie's terribly sick.
The doctor's there. She wants us.
What? Let's get going.
I'm so glad you've come.
I'll call the doctor.
Oh, I'm afraid it's awfully serious.
- I hope not. What's the matter, doctor?
- From what I gather, he injured his arm...
...when he was swung up on that wire during your show.
- His arm.
- It's perfectly possible for him...
...to have gone around all this time without knowing the arm was broken.
That often happens.
Unfortunately, what was a simple fracture then...
...has developed into a serious complication now.
And it is serious.
He's had that injury for over a week.
- What are you doing for him, doctor?
- There's not much that I can do.
It calls for an operation by someone who is an expert.
- Or else...
- or else what?
Unless that boy is operated on within the next few hours, I...
Well, I can't be responsible for him.
Oh, no.
Well, we've got to do something.
You're right, son. I've phoned the best orthopedic man I know.
Dr. Ganglin at the General Hospital in Chicago.
But he's operating today, and can't possibly get away.
That leaves us only one alternative.
We've got to get Willie to Chicago.
Well, all right, let's get him there.
Yes, get him there.
But we've got to get him there immediately.
- Well, couldn't we charter a plane?
- That would cost a lot of money.
I'm afraid Mrs. Brewster could hardly afford that.
How much would it cost, doctor?
About $200.
Call the airport. We have the money.
- Two hundred dollars?
- Well, what are you waiting for?
- All right, I'll take care of it.
- Doctor, could we see Willie now, please?
Yes, I think you should.
Oh, Mrs. Brewster, could I see you a moment?
Hello, shortstop.
I heard you. I'm not going.
Going where?
In that airplane.
Oh, but you've gotta go.
I know where you're getting the money.
And you're not gonna spend it on me.
What's money?
It's like corny saxophone players, you can shake it out of trees.
Look, Willie, I'm your friend, aren't I?
- Yeah.
- And Jimmy's your friend too, isn't he?
Yeah.
Well, have we ever asked you to do anything that wasn't good for you?
Look, Willie. Jimmy's a boss.
The only reason we've gotten anywhere with the band...
...is because we've listened to him.
And everybody's always done what he's asked us to.
Even hard things.
Things that we sometimes didn't agree with.
But the only reason the band has done anything...
...the show and the play and the dance...
Well, those were little things.
And now, don't you see, Willie?
You're giving us a chance to do a big thing.
Why, to Jimmy and me and every person in the band...
...you're more important than all the broadcasts in the world.
We've got the rest of our lives to do broadcasts.
I know you'll do it because
I know you won't let us down.
You'll do it, won't you, Willie?
I always wanted to ride in an airplane.
- Mr. Connors is here, sir.
- Well, show him in.
- Yes, sir. This way, please.
- Thank you.
- Hello, Jimmy.
- Hello, Mr. Morgan.
- Breakfast?
- No, thanks. I don't care for anything.
- Well, sit down.
- Thank you, sir.
What time is that
Whiteman broadcast tonight?
Oh, 8:00.
Well, think you could win that contest?
I know we could, if we were there.
How long would it take you to get your band together and get out of town?
Like that:
Well, that's too long.
There's a special train pulling into the yard in three quarters of an hour.
I want you to be on it.
We'll be on it, Mr. Morgan.
But will it get us there in time?
Well, this train will. I've been connected to that railroad for 20 years.
And this is the first time
I've ever had any fun out of it.
Now, get going and strike up the band.
Do you mean it? You ain't kidding us, huh?
Oh, thanks, Mr. Morgan.
Johnson, if you're looking for that pension, you'd better get this train in on time.
Don't worry, Mr. Morgan.
This one's got to be in on time.
- Well, hello, everybody. Here we are.
- Hurry up. Hurry up, Barbara.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, my dear.
Hurry up. Hurry up, Barbara.
Well, here we go.
- Goodbye now. Good luck, my boy.
- Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Hurry up, Mary. Well, goodbye, Mom.
- Do you think we're gonna be the best?
- Everybody thinks so.
I don't know.
Everybody will be listening in.
- New York, Chicago, all over.
- They all came from Riverwood.
- Yeah.
- Anyway, I think you're the best.
And your father, he'd be so proud of you.
Well, then we're gonna win.
- You know what, Mom?
- What, Jimmy?
I'm gonna make you a queen.
- Goodbye. Goodbye, everybody.
- Goodbye.
Goodbye, Jimmy.
Good luck.
Time's about up. Three seconds to go.
- Are you ready?
- Almost.
- That's it.
- There you are.
Connect me with the stage.
I have the winner.
Come on, girls. You can see from here.
Thank you ladies and gentlemen for listening...
...and for your wonderful reaction.
I'd also like to thank you for your votes by phone and telegram...
...from all parts of the nation.
Which helped us pick the winner of this contest.
Which only goes to prove that this country not only has a genuine love for music...
...but is happy to acclaim the youth of America.
This wonderful enthusiasm and fine musicianship...
...demonstrated here tonight makes me feel quite safe in saying...
...that we need have no fear for the future of American music.
And now for the winner, a name you're probably hearing for the first time tonight.
But which may in the future become a musical byword.
Jimmy Connors and his band.
Thank you. Thank you.
- Jimmy, it's wonderful.
- Gosh, aren't you thrilled, Mary?
Thank you.
- Here. It's for you.
- Me?
Oh, Jimmy.
And now for our final number...
...performed by a combination of all our contesting bands and glee clubs.
The honor of leading this finale goes to our young winner, Jimmy Connors.
I feel pretty sure Jimmy's got a few tricks up his sleeve he hasn't told me about.
- Maybe.
- Mr. Connors, the stick.
Thank you, Mr. Whiteman.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Well, I guess this is it.
I don't have to tell you how I feel.
If I felt any better, gosh, I couldn't stand it.
When something wonderful like this happens to anybody...
...I suppose you ought to thank somebody.
They're not here, but I know they're listening in.
Mr. Judd, I was all wrong about you.
You'll always be a swell guy with us because you said:
"I'll buy the first ticket."
And as for you, Willie, you little shortstop, even though you're in love with my girl...
...we're all thinking about you and we want you to hurry up...
...and get out of bed because we all need you.
And of all the people throughout the United States...
...who might be listening to this program...
...there's only one thing I'd like to say.
To the most important one of all.
Mom.
I don't know what I was thinking about when I said that someday...
...l'd make you a queen.
Because if you hadn't been a queen all the time...
...l'd never be here now.
Well, here it comes, Mom.
We must have music in the land
For everybody loves a band
A good old rousing melody
Is a joy and inspiration
A hundred million folks agree
That a tune can stir a nation
So, music master, take command
Our hearts will beat to beat the band
Let the drums roll out
Let the trumpet call
- While the people shout
- Hooray!
Strike up the band
Hear the cymbals ring
Calling one and all
To that happy swing
Strike up the band
Yankee doo doodle-oo, doodle-oo
We'll come through Yankee doo, doodle-oo.
For the red, white, and blue, doodle-oo
Lend a hand
With the flag unfurled
We can face the world
Hey, leader, strike up the band
Let the drums roll out
Let the trumpet call
While the people shout
Strike up the band
Hear the cymbals ring
Calling one and all
To that martial swing
Strike up the band
And we'll all give the cheer as we stand
To the man with the stick in his hand
He's the man whose command of the band
Makes the band grand
And you can't go wrong
With a happy song
Hey, leader
Say, leader
Hey, leader, strike up the band
Mister leader
We all want to dance, sir
Give our feet a chance, sir
And say you'll play the La Conga
Rhythm is frantic
We feel romantic
Play a song of love
Our love affair
Was meant to be
It's me for you, dear
And you for me
We'll fuss and quarrel
And tears start to brew
But after the tears
Our love will smile through
When youth has had
Its merry fling
We'll spend our evenings
Remembering
Two happy people
Who say on the square
Isn't ours a lovely
Love affair
If you feel you need a kick
Rhythm ought to do the trick
Mister leader, shake that stick
Let 'em hear the drummer boy play
With our flags unfurled
We can face the world
Hey, leader, strike up the band
Thank you. Thank you.
And now, Command Performance brings to all you boys overseas... the girl who made pins famous.
The army's pinup girl, the navy's pinup girl... and the marine's pinup girl,
Miss Betty Grable.
Betty, welcome to Command Performance.
Thank you, Kay. And if my face is red, it's because I'm tickled pink to be here.
I know you are, darling. I'll bet of all the boys who are listening and could answer... they'd say "darling" too.
- So how about sending a cheer to a few of them over the air?
- I'd love to.
Here's a salute to Sergeant Michael Boyle and the gang at 944.
Another to Bill Sterns and the squad at A.P.O. 845.
And to Corporal Jed Homer and the bunch in Samoa.
And to all the fellas over there, hello.
If I could ask you into the old front parlor and turn down the light, it would be-
Cuddle up
A little closer
Lovey mine
Cuddle up
And be my little
Clinging vine
Like to feel your cheek so rosy
Like to make you comfy cozy
'Cause I love from head to toesy
Lovey mine
If you leave me, I'll be lonely
Though our love has just begun
Don't forget I want you only
Yes
You're the only one
Cuddle up
A little closer
Lovey mine
Cuddle up
And be my little
Clinging vine
Like to feel your cheek
So rosy
Like to make you
Comfy cozy
'Cause I love
From head to toesy
Lovey mine
And now it's time to say good night again from Command Performance.
And remember, this is your program exclusively... to give you the entertainment that you want.
So please send in your requests.
Until we meet again, and from
 your other entertainers of this evening-
Jimmy Dorsey and his band.
Martha Raye.
Well, good night, fellas.
Gosh, I- I wish I could kiss all of you all at once.
Yeah, and I got the mouth that can do it too.
Mitzi Mayfair.
Gee, I feel just like Martha does.
I wish I could dance with every one of you.
And I've got the legs-
Carole Landis.
Bye-bye, boys. And I'll be here to, uh-
Sigh for you.
Your mistress of ceremonies, Kay Francis, who doesn't sing, dance or recite... but is willing to stick out her neck... if, uh, necking is entertainment.
And we won't come back
Till it's over over there
- Kay, honey, you were great.
- Oh, thanks, Jimmy.
- When do you leave on the U.S.O. circuit?
- Can't tell. It's hush-hush.
Uncle Sam slips you a ticket, a shot in the arm and you're on your way.
Can't you even tell me where I can send you a necktie for Christmas?
Well, seeing it's you, Kay.
- Okay.
- London.
In that case, I can put that tie around your neck in person.
- Are you going over?
- Shh. I'm hush-hush too.
I just got permission from Washington.
I leave as soon as I can get an entertainment unit together.
- Martha, you coming?
- Yeah, I'm comin'.
Hey, what's the matter with you?
Well, every time I do one of these shows,
I- I hate to hear them sign off.
I wish I could be over there with all those boys.
Oh, be yourself, honey.
You know you haven't a chance.
And even if you did, what could you do with a million soldiers?
What could I- Are you kidding?
Pardon me.
May I introduce our guest for tonight...
Colonel Hartley of the British Foreign Office.
- How do you do, sir?
- How do you do, Colonel?
It's so nice to meet you.
This is indeed a pleasure.
I'd like to compliment you ladies.
You don't know what a fine thing you're doing with these Command Performance broadcasts.
What are we giving?
Just a couple of hours of our time.
If- If I were a man
Like Joey Brown or Al Jolson... well, I'd be over there right now.
I'd even tramp in the mud with 'em up to the battlefront.
- I'd even go-
- Why, girls, I didn't know you felt that way.
- Gee, it's marvelous!
- Well, I guess you don't know us, Kay.
Of course it's all right for a girl like you to stay at home. Well, we're rugged women.
We want to be right at the front with our men.
- Sure we do.
- Certainly.
I think it's admirable the way you girls volunteer for overseas service.
Miss Francis, you'll have no trouble getting your entertainment unit together.
Why, here they are.
Well, you see, Colonel, we sort of-
What?
Well, I hadn't told you girls, but with Colonel Hartley's help...
I just got the green light from Washington to take a show overseas.
I can't tell you how glad I am that you're so anxious to go too.
Are you ladies quite sure that you're not being a little impulsive?
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.
Well, then it's in the groove. Tomorrow we'll get together about your passports...
 your fingerprints and your inoculations.
I'll send a wire off to Washington immediately.
Well, good night, kids.
See you tomorrow. Coming, Colonel?
- Yes, yes.
- Good night.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh.
- Here you are.
- Thank you.
- Is anyone meeting you?
- Well, they're supposed to.
- So this is London, huh?
- Well, not quite.
- Then where are we?
- This is your undesignated airport.
You're still about 60 miles from London.
- Halt.
- Oh, hello.
- Glad to see you, but I'm in a hurry.
- Just a minute!
- Who are you?
- Who am I?
- Yes.
- Well, I'm certainly surprised at you.
Is that anyway to help along friendly relations?
Why, do you suppose that when Mr. Roosevelt met Mr. Churchill he said, "Who are you?"
No. He said, "Hello, Winnie.
How are you?"
And Mr. Churchill answered,
"I'm fine. How are you, Frank?"
- What's your name?
- Herbert.
Well, Herbert, how are you?
- Oh, I'm very well. Thank you, sir.
- I'm Eddie.
Good to see you. Good-bye.
So long.
It's been awfully nice knowing you.
And I'm sure that your American boys will give you a wonderful reception.
Hello. Glad to see you.
I'm Sergeant Hart, your liaison man.
I'm- Oh, excuse me, sir.
Well, now that you're properly taken care of, I have to report in.
So I'll say good luck and good-bye.
I hope we shall meet again some time.
Let's wish on that.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Well, I certainly was glad to get here to meet you girls.
I- Oh, I have a special message from the C.O.
Colonel Nelson wishes to welcome you to England... and considers it a privilege to have you ladies here.
- Now, may I speak for myself?
- Surely.
Girls!
Gosh, you don't know what it means to me to see you ladies!
Now I know what a milk shake goes through.
- Hey, you just missed a road!
- He missed England.
We crossed the channel.
That's funny. "We crossed the channel."
It's 5:30.
What's that?
Good morning. It's 5:30.
Oh, he must be walking in his sleep.
Sleep? I haven't slept a wink all night long.
Who could with all those cannons going off?
Gee-whiz, but it's cold.
Well, I certainly brought the right nighties.
Wow. Listen to that rain.
There they go again.
Ouch.
Those are the channel guns from France.
- Practicing?
- Uh-huh, on us.
- What?
- We'll get used to it.
This is what we came for, isn't it?
- Boy, and did we get it. Just look at this place.
- And look at us.
Gosh, the first morning I meet the boys and this is the way we look.
Oh, I'm just gonna make myself so beautiful right here in my little magic mirror.
Oh, shut up, Martha!
Well, I'm sorry. Oh, Mitzi, gee-whiz.
I wish I could have brought my hairdresser with me.
I wish I could have brought another face along.
This one needs a retread.
I wish it would stop raining.
- Hey, can I come in?
- Oh, it's Eddie, our escort.
- Yeah, come in.
- Okay.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, girls. Glad to see you.
I hope you ladies slept all right.
I didn't sleep a wink.
I even put my feet on the top bunk... and my head on the bottom bunk so the blood would rush to my head.
- No sleep?
- No blood.
How are ya?
Gosh, Miss Raye, you look ravishing.
Even without your makeup on.
- Why, you-
- Martha. What have you got here?
These are for you. Some galoshes, some tin helmets and some gas masks.
- Thanks.
- Hey, I hope you kids got your own raincoats.
- Yeah, we've got them.
- Good.
I wouldn't want you to get wet on your way over to breakfast.
- Why didn't we have breakfast in bed?
- I tried to arrange that... but they wouldn’t let me roll four cots into the mess hall- politics.
- That's it!
- Honey, honey, honey.
She keeps fighting me.
Eyes right!
Front!
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh, no. Oh, no, thank you.
I don't usually start the day off as pleasantly as this.
I, uh- I lost my boot.
- Let me help you.
- Please do.
- Lovely mud.
- Would you please put my foot into my boot?
Oh, certainly.
Thank you.
- Isn't mud wonderful?
- I don't see anything so wonderful about mud.
Say, look, I'm leaving on a mission as soon as the weather breaks.
- Will you be here when I get back?
- When will you be back?
- About an hour, I hope.
- I hope I'll be here.
Say, um, you look like somebody
I've seen before.
- Really?
- Definitely.
Well, the name might help.
- Miss Landis.
- Miss Landis.
- Carole?
- Yes!
Carole Landis. Hmm.
Carole Landis! Wow!
Well, what do you know?
- Carole, where have you been?
- Stuck in the lovely mud.
- Well, now for your first G.I. breakfast.
- Man, am I hungry.
- Miss Raye, won't you take my arm?
- I'm not that hungry.
Good morning. We fellows of fighter squadron heard you were here... and want to welcome you and thank you for coming.
- And now breakfast is served.
- Well, what are we waiting for?
Oh, Miss Raye, the officers invited you first.
- I'm sorry, Sarge.
- Oh. We didn't know.
- But the invitation goes any time.
- Thank you very much.
The ladies are sorry, and they thank you, but they've already been invited up top.
Thank you, ladies. Right this way, girls.
Sir, Sergeant Hart reporting and turning over to you...
Miss Kay Francis, Miss Carole Landis,
Miss Mitzi Mayfair and Miss Martha Raye.
How do you do, ladies? I'm Captain Stewart,
 your escort to officers' mess.
Colonel Nelson sends his compliments, and you're to have anything you want.
- Anything, Captain?
- Anything, Miss Francis.
Well, if it’s all right with you, we'd like about 10 minutes to say hello to the boys here.
- Why, certainly.
- Hey, fellas, Kay Francis just fixed it up.
- What do you want, chow or music?
- Music!
We hear ya.
Here we go again.
Hello there.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
- Ready, girls?
- Attention, Fighter Squadron.
Attention, Fighter Squadron, report to Operations immediately.
Scheduled flight ready to take off..
That is all.
Well, that's the first time an audience ever walked out on me and left me happy.
- It's pretty busy around here when fighters take off.
- Fighters?
- Yes. Would you be interested in seeing them go?
- I'd love to.
- Hey, when are we gonna eat?
- We'll eat later.
Run along, kids. I've got to see
Colonel Nelson. Coming, Eddie?
Captain Morgan, Smith, I want you to meet some ladies who are going to entertain you.
- This is Miss Raye, Miss Landis and Miss Mayfair.
- Hello. How are you?
Nice to see you. Hello there.
We're mighty proud to meet you girls and I'd sure like to visit... but it'll have to be another time.
- So long.
- So long.
- Happy landings.
- Good luck.
Oh, there's Captain Terry Long. He's got eight to his credit. He's from California.
Oh, boy! California, here I come.
- Say, isn't there another one?
- No. No, I don't think so.
- Oh, yes, there's Captain Warren.
- Oh.
- Hello again, Miss Landis.
- Hello.
- Oh, you've met?
- Oh, yes.
That's right.
You're from California too.
- Captain Stewart.
- Yes. Excuse me, please.
It was pretty thickheaded, my not recognizing you right away... even with the wind and the rain in your hair.
- I must have been a beautiful mess.
- Beautiful.
Where will you be tonight?
Well, I don't know.
I mean, somewhere in England.
Hey, Ted, your crate can't take off without you.
Carole, they made me a short snorter.
- Here, Dick, meet Miss Whosit. I'll be right with you. - But, Ted, you can't-
- Mitzi!
- Dick!
- Oh, how are you?
- Oh, swell.
- It's good to see you.
- It's grand seeing you.
Oh, you look wonderful.
Oh, I forgot. I'm not talking to you.
Well, come to think of it,
I'm not talking to you either.
Well, now that we got that settled, how you been doing?
- Fine.
- That's too bad.
Oh, thanks.
I hope you're doing as well.
Booked solid. Don't tell me
 you're over here as an entertainer.
- The army can't be that hard up.
- Oh, aren't they?
Then what are you doing in uniform?
Come here.
You see, my draft board told me that working with you was a nonsensical occupation.
Listen, when you and I were a team, where did we get? Nowhere.
- Couldn't you stay over?
- Oh, I'd love to, but we take orders from the army too.
- I'll find you. I'll look you up the minute I get leave.
- Good luck with your show.
- Good luck with yours.
Hey, Dick, come on!
Don't you know there's a war on?
You're telling me.
It just caught up with me.
- Oh, Dick.
- Yeah?
Are you piloting one of those planes?
No, I'm in the Engineers, and I stay on the ground.
- Well, were you worried, honey?
- Oh, no.
I was just wondering how you'd squeeze that big head of yours into a flying helmet.
Oh, good-bye!
Hey, when do we eat, huh?
- Can I come in?
- No!
Well, that's too bad.
I only got some mail here, that's all.
- Mail! Mail! Mail!
- Come in here.
Dut, dut, dut. Wait.
I didn't get them sorted yet.
Now, this one's for Miss Mayfair.
It's from Lieutenant Ryan.
Says, "Having a good time. Glad you're not here."
But he's only kidding, of course.
Oh, for Miss Raye. It's from that private
 you gave your photograph to.
Miss Francis, this is from that
English captain you met on the plane.
- Do you remember?
- Eddie, just deliver it. Don't read it.
Kay, Kay, Mitzi, Martha...
Kay, me, Mitzi, Kay, me.
It's from Ted.
Oh, Miss Raye.
What can I do to make you happy?
- Glad to see you.
- Glad-
Uh-uh-uh.
Kay, Ted has a 24-hour leave and he's going to meet me. Where will we be Sunday?
Now, listen, Carole, honey,
 you know I can't tell you.
Oh, I know it's a military secret, but this is Ted's only chance.
Come on. Break down.
Well, we've just been asked to Lady Carlton-Smith's for the weekend.
- Where?
- We do a Red Cross benefit there.
We'll have time to rehearse a new show, get all polished up-
- Where is it?
- We can buy some new dresses... meet a lot of brass hats and ambassadors and stay in bed and rest.
Where?
- London.
- London!
Now look, everyone.
This is just a camp show.
And in camp, well, the boys all sit on the floor.
So, uh, please.
And now, to open our all-American program...
I give you that maestro of jive... that- that minstrel of chill and groove...
Mr. Jimmy Dorsey and his band.
Thank you.
- Jimmy.
- Thank you, Kay.
Oh, hello, Ted. Gee, Dick.
I'm so glad you could make it.
- Thanks, Miss Francis. Just keep on requesting me.
- Well, come along.
The concert was over
In Carnegie Hall
And the maestro took bow after bow
What did you expect, chimes?
He said, "My dear friends
"I have given my all
And I'm sorry it's all over now"
When from the gallery way up high
I rose from my seat
With this mournful cry
Oh-ho
Oh-ho-ho
Mr. Paganini
Please play my rhapsody
And if you cannot play it
Won't you sing it
And if you can't sing it
Then you'll simply have to
Swing it, I said swing it
Oh, I mean swing it
Oh, ding dong ding it
Cut!
Please.
Mr. Paganini
We breathlessly await
Your masterful baton
Go on and sling it
And if you can't sling it
Then you'll simply have to
Quiet! You fool, you.
We've heard your repertoire Boots! Boots!
And at that final bar
We greeted you
With wild applause
And what a grand ovation
With your interpretation of
Whoa, ho, ho, ho, ho
Would cause
Mr. Paganini
Don't you be a meanie
What have you up your sleeve
Come on and spring it
If you can't spring it
Then you'll simply have to
Swing it
-Get it, boys
-We'll take it
Well, swing it
Well, snap my wig if he don't dig
Won't you swing it, Mr. P.
- Gee, that was grand, Martha.
- Wonderful.
They just loved you.
Okay, Jimmy, go on.
How blue
The night
How long the day
How blue the night
With you away
How strange it seems
Just living in dreams
I'm left in the moon glow
But where did the moon go
The stars on high
That used to burn
Are standing by
For your return
Until my arms
Are holding you tight
How blue my heart
How blue
The night
How blue the night
How long the day
How blue the night
With you away
How strange it seems
Just living in dreams
I'm left in the moon glow
But where did the moon go
The stars on high
That used to burn
Are standing by
For your return
Until my arms
Are holding you tight
How blue my heart
How blue
The night
- Pardon me.
- Certainly.
Until my arms
Are holding you tight
How blue my heart
How blue the night
How blue
The night
Well, that's it.
Now, everybody get up, because you're losing a lot of good dancing time.
Come on.
Thank the boys for me, Jimmy.
And, gee, you were swell.
Oh.
Oh, excuse me, Jimmy.
Sorry.
- Hello, Captain.
- Hello.
- Do you dance?
- Well, so badly I wouldn't have the courage to ask you.
Oh, well, in that case, let's sit it out.
It's- It's much more pleasant than dancing anyway. Come on.
You know, I've thought of you so often since we arrived in England.
- You have?
- Yes. You see, I'm a very curious person.
I've thought of all the things that I don't know about you.
I'm afraid I'm not very interesting.
Like hundreds of other medical chaps, I gave up what I was doing and asked for a uniform.
- And what were you doing?
- Pediatrics.
Oh, a baby doctor.
Well, for goodness sake.
Are you interested in, uh, babies?
Oh, frightfully.
Tell me more about them.
Well, you see, they-
- You know, I've been a mother so often.
- You have?
Oh, yes, dozens and dozens of times.
Week in and week out.
- It was a bit wearing, wasn't it?
- Oh, no, I just loved it.
I've even been Deanna Durbin's mother.
Of course, they were just motion picture babies.
Sort of like Charles Lamb's
Dream Children.
I see.
Oh, will you forgive me?
It was quite by accident.
But you know, if I'd held this hand 10 years ago...
I might have had a full house by now.
Oh, Captain.
Very good humor it was.
Oh, but really,
I- I don't deserve all this praise.
You're too modest, Miss Raye.
You can't imagine what excellent reports we've had of your work at the camps.
Right.
We've only had one complaint.
A regiment shipping for Africa regretted only that they had to leave you girls.
Oh, now isn't that sweet?
Well, our hearts went right with them.
We'd go, too, if they’d let us.
- You would?
- Oh, Africa's another thing, you know.
- It's an active battle zone, and all that sort of thing.
- Battle zone?
Why, Admiral, as if- as if that would bother us. We can take anything.
You know, we're not buttercups.
We're soldiers.
And where our men go, we'll go, too, if they’ll let us.
Would you really?
Why, in a minute.
That's if we had the chance.
Let's shake this shindig.
I know a little café where-
Oh, I'd love to, Ted, but you should get some rest.
I will, when I'm old.
- Come on.
- All right.
- Will you dance, Miss Raye?
- I'd rather talk, thank you.
- Excuse me, won't you? I must see Miss Landis.
- Of course.
Oh, Miss Landis.
If you're ready to leave, I'm at your disposal.
- Oh, General, I don't think-
- Now, now.
I'm going to show you every place worthwhile in London.
The relaxation will do you a world of good.
I'll get my cap.
- Oh, Ted, I'm awfully sorry.
- Why didn't you turn him down?
You can't say no to a general.
- When I met him tonight, he told me he had a surprise for me- - Fine.
Now we'll surprise him and duck.
Oh, no, that's desertion.
He could have me shot, you know.
- Ready, little one?
- General, Miss Landis and I-
Ted, I'll see you when we play
 your camp again- Christmas.
Good night.
Now I'll tell you what we'll do.
First-
Oh. I have a message for Miss Martha Raye, from the War Department.
- Right over there, sir.
- Thank you.
Oh, Miss Raye?
Miss Raye.
May I be excused, gentlemen?
- Certainly.
- Thank you.
- From headquarters.
- Thank you very much.
Gosh, you sure look nice.
- But there is no message.
- Yeah, I know.
It's the only way I could get in.
But I'll tell you what the message is.
From Sergeant Eddie Hart to Miss Martha Raye.
Subject: rendezvous.
Fish and chips and café au lait.
That means coffee.
Oh, no, dear boy. Some other time.
I'm frightfully sorry.
It just can't be done, you know.
Well, carry on.
Pip-pip and all that sort of thing. Cheerio.
How do you like that?
She gives me that "cheerio, pip-pip" routine.
Miss Raye is very charming.
- Oh, frightfully so.
- Yes.
Yes.
- Psst.
- Huh?
Oh.
Too bad there weren't more places to go.
We must do it again sometime.
Yes, I'll look forward to that, sir.
- Good night, General.
- Good night, little one.
Good morning, miss.
Good morning, Parkins.
The other ladies have been in bed for hours, miss.
- Have they?
- They have.
And in the future,
I hopes you keep respectable hours.
Ted!
- I've been waiting here all night for you.
- You have?
Why?
Oh, just to say good night.
Well?
- I hope you had a terrible time.
- I did.
- Good.
- Darling.
All the way down here in the jeep
 you couldn't get to Ted fast enough.
- Now you want to pin his ears back.
- With her arms around his neck.
- Hi, kids. How are you?
- Hi!
- Well, for goodness sake, a Christmas tree.
- How 'bout that?
- Well, bless their hearts.
- What do you know... a Christmas tree with things and stuff.
- Ain't that sweet?
- Say, did either of you see Ted?
- Uh, Ted? Oh, he's gone off on a mission.
- And they ain't got back yet.
Say, Kay, here's a nice gift for you- some pipe cleaners.
- Oh, those characters kill me.
- Yeah, isn't that wonderful?
- Gosh, hairpins!
- When are they due back?
When I was a kid in Brooklyn, we had the biggest Christmas tree.
- We lived right next door to Prospect Park.
- Eddie. Eddie, answer me.
- Huh? Oh, the mission.
- Oh, darling, don't start worrying.
- The fighters are late lots of times. Aren't they, Eddie?
- Sure. That don't mean nothing.
- And we used to string popcorn-
- How- How long overdue are they?
Oh, hardly at all.
They'll be back any minute now.
Yeah, they probably run into a flock of Nazis over the channel.
But that won't take 'em long.
There! I told ya!
Come on, Eddie!
It's a bomber.
I guess I'd better get over to the hall and get the things started for the show.
Don't worry, Miss Landis.
Hey, you know, it's cold out here!
You're gonna catch your death, Carole.
Come on in.
Go on, honey.
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
- Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh- Come here, kids.
Look what I got for ya here.
Wait a second.
- Merry Christmas, Carole. Tissues.
- Oh, wonderful.
- Happy New Year, Martha! Soap.
- Just what I needed.
And for little Mitzi here, I got a toothbrush and some paste, with love and kisses.
Aw, thanks, Kay.
Dorsey's starting the show for the boys.
- Hey, we'd better get going.
- Yeah.
Hey, Mitzi. Is my gas mask over there?
- No, it's on the shelf above your bed.
- Oh.
Can you imagine paying nine pounds for these boots?
Yeah. A pound a pound.
Carole, honey, you stay here.
We can keep things going in there.
- Then you come on over when Ted gets here.
- No, I'll come along.
- Listen, sweet. - Look, I'm not pulling the show-must-go-on routine.
I'd just rather be there, that's all.
- When Ted comes, he'll find me.
- Okay.
- Here's your coat.
- Thank you.
Shh. Later. Hey, fellas.
Look, the girls! What do you say?
Merry Christmas to you!
And listen- listen, boys.
I can't tell you how thrilled we were about your man-made Christmas tree.
Gee, it was beautiful. We want to thank you for all your thoughtfulness and good wishes.
Huh?
Well, that's just a sample of the merry
Christmas we guys really wish you girls.
And now we got a surprise for you.
Hey, Bill!
- Are they on the air yet?
- Just came on. Stand by.
...presented each and every week from Hollywood... and bringing you tonight a special Christmas
Command Performance broadcast.
And now, as your master of ceremonies,
Georgie Jessel.
We bring you tonight a galaxy of great artists... and a merry Christmas from all of us.
From the top of our Christmas tree of talent...
I pick you one of its brightest stars with a love song, if you please.
A song with a lot of heart... the kind of song that I used to sing when I first went on the stage.
That was a long time ago.
I was nine years old.
Over 20 years ago.
Easy.
Ah, but in those days, all the songs were sentimental.
I remember my father singing "Will You
Love Me in December as You Do in May?"
Now he sings "Pistol-Packin' Mama,
Put That Thing Away."
Ah, but enough of me, and on with beauty.
The lady with the velvet throat,
Miss Alice Faye.
Thank you, Mr. Jessel.
And to each of you in the army, navy and merchant marine...
I can't tell you how sincerely our hearts are with you tonight.
I can't tell you how much we miss you.
But I can tell you how proud we are of you.
And from us, who stay at home- from your mothers, wives and sweethearts- tonight, more than ever... we send you this message.
You'll never know
Just how much
I miss you
You'll never know
Just how much
I care
And If I tried
I still couldn't hide
My love for you
You ought to know
For haven’t I told you so
A million or more times
You went away
And my heart
Went with you
I speak your name
I n my every prayer
If there is some other way
To prove that I love you
I swear I don't know how
You'll never know
If you don't know now
How I miss you
I speak your name
In my every prayer
If there is some other way
To prove that I love you
I swear
I don't know how
You'll never know
If you don't
Know
Now
Thank you, sweet Alice.
That should fill the stockings of the lads who requested Miss Faye for a Christmas present.
How about the lucky mob of that fighter command somewhere in England... who have Kay Francis, Carole Landis, Martha
Raye and Mitzi Mayfair with them tonight?
Who said there wasn't a Santa Claus?
And if you're listening in, girls, we're proud of you. Yes indeed. Mighty proud.
And now, gentlemen... methinks I hear in the distance the approach of that Brazilian flying fortress, Carmen Miranda.
I, yi, yi, yi, yi
I like you very much
I, yi, yi, yi, yi
I think you're grand
Why, why, why is it that when I feel your touch
My heart starts to beat to beat the band
I, yi, yi, yi, yi
I like you to hold me tight
You are too, too, too, too, too divine
If you want to be in someone's arms tonight
Just be sure the arms
 you're in are mine
Oh, I like your lips
And I like your eyes
You do like my hips to 'hipsnotize' you
We see, see, see, see, see, see, see the moon above
Way, way, way, way, way up in the blue
Sì, sì, sì, señor
I think I fall in love
And when I fall
I think I fall for you
I, yi, yi, yi
Sì, sì, sì, sì
I, yi, yi, yi, can see, see, see that you're for me
I, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi
Yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi
I like you very much
- I, yi, yi, yi, yi
- I think you're grand
Why, why, why is it that when I feel your touch
My heart starts to beat to beat the band
I,yi,yi,yi,yi,yi,
Yi,yi,yi,yi,yi,yi
Like you to hold me tight
You are too, too, too, too, too divine
If you want to be in someone's arms tonight
Just be sure the arms
 you're in are mine
Oh, I like your lips and I like your eyes
You do like my hips to 'hipsnotize' you
We see, see, see, see, see, see, see the moon above
Way, way, way, way, way up in the blue
- Sì, sì, sì, señor, I think I fall in love
- Sì, sì, sì, sì
And when I fall
I think I fall for you
- I, yi, yi, yi
- I, yi
- Sì, sì, sì, sì
- Sì, sì
- I, yi, yi, yi, can see, see, see
- Sì, sì, sì, sì
That you for me
And believe me, ladies, I can speak for the rest of the gang by saying... we're lucky having you with us here tonight.
And don't think we got you over here to wear you down- no, sir- because you've been entertaining all over England.
Tonight we're gonna entertain you.
So you can just sit there, relax and be beautiful.
You girls, you!
Now I’d like to introduce an officer and a gentleman... who really helped put this thing on tonight...
Lieutenant Dick Ryan.
Sergeant. Thank you.
You send me
Right out of this world
You send me
You give me that kick
I never knew
You send me
You're making me know I'm livin'
Who wouldn't be livin'
Lovin' you
When people shout
"Hey there
Come out of your cloud"
I just want to stay there
Satisfied and starry-eyed
'Cause you send me
Right out of this world
But, darling
There's one thing I hope
You never do
Don't ever send me away
- From you
- Do, do, do, do
When people shout
"Hey there
Why don't you look where you're goin'
You better come out of your cloud"
- I just wanna stay there
- Do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do
Satisfied and starry-eyed
'Cause you send me
Right out of this world
But, darling
There's one thing I hope
You never do
Don't ever send me away
From you
You send me
Out of this world
- Thank you, Jimmy.
- Sure thing.
Thanks a lot, Lieutenant.
I got some news for you. You send me too.
And now I've had numerous requests... to play a clarinet solo.
You look surprised. Oh, yes, I used to play with the school band back home.
Pretty sharp too.
Do you mind If I borrow a clarinet?
- Wonderful. Thanks a lot.
- Wonderful.
I'd like to play
"No Love, No Nothing"... making the eight ball in the side pocket at the same time.
- Do you mind If I latch on with you?
- Hmm?
Latch on with you.
Get groovy, rooty, zooty.
This guy don't talk English.
- Oh, you mean you want to play with me.
- Love it.
I'll tell you, Jim, it's not that I got anything against you... but, you see, I don’t just play the song straight.
I take a lot of liberties with it. I do a chromatic scale, go into a dominic seven... finishing up on a high "D" above high "C."
- Think you can handle that?
- Oh, you mean like this?
Snaky sort of a guy, isn't he?
His brother Tommy warned me about him.
Thanks a lot.
I'll play alone, if you don't mind.
Would you give me a little introduction, please, Jimmy?
Tiny. Tiny.
Thanks a lot.
I'm ready now.
- Who do you have to know to play a solo around here?
- Dave.
Do you mind If I play a little too?
You civilian, you.
Oh, yes. When I do play, will the first three rows lean back a little...
'cause there's a fine spray comes out of this thing.
Glad you're here?
Hey. Hey!
- Hey!
- Hmm?
What's going on behind that orchestra?
There's nothing going on behind the orchestra.
There's nothing going on in front of it either.
Look, uh, don't get cute just because you're out there, kid.
Don't think I can't reach you, you know.
One, two, three, and I'll jump all over you.
Four, five, six, and you'll jump right off again, bud.
Oh, are you showin' off?
Think you're cute because the girls are here?
What, are you a big man because you're sitting next to a master-sergeant?
- Is he your brother?
- No, my brother's livin'.
That's nice.
Look, you don't have to heckle me, kid.
I'm trying to do my best, give the boys a little music.
You call that music?
We got a cow at home that makes the same noise and gives milk besides.
Wow. Oh, boy. Some funny joke.
- It's one of my father's jokes.
- What are you, one of your mother's?
Glad to see ya.
One, two... three, four... five, six-
One of them's in trouble.
They're going to a crash landing.
Merry Christmas, honey.
Oh! Oh, Ted!
Oh!
I 's al I right, honey. Al I right.
That's fine. Thank you.
Now let's have one, cutting the cake.
Oh, it isn't a real cake. It's made of cardboard. Just as sweet though.
Look, honey.
Not as fattening either.
- Now hold it. Just like that, please.
- Like this?
- Splendid.
- Thank you very much.
Thank you.
You can cut the cake now.
- Oh. Yeah.
- Shall we cut it?
Uh-huh.
- There. Get some plates for me, will you, darling?
- Sure.
Mrs. Warren. Uh, Mrs. Warren.
- Oh. Oh, that's me!
- Yeah. Where are we going on your honeymoon?
Father Harris told us about a little inn near Stratford... that's been there since Shakespeare was a kid.
- It's only big enough to accommodate the two of us.
- Oh.
Aren't weddings beautiful?
They're so romantic.
Yeah, till the honeymoon's over and the grocery bills start comin' in.
Oh, that doesn't have anything to do with it.
Two can live as cheap as one.
Well, how 'bout when the stork moves in?
A stork doesn't eat very much.
- Thanks, Miss Francis. Thanks for the pictures.
- Not at all, boys.
- Good-bye, Miss Francis.
- See you soon.
Miss Francis, your work here is most commendable.
Thank you, Father.
I thought the service was-
- Hi, Sarge.
- How are ya?
- I thought the service was charming, didn't you?
- Delightful, delightful.
We were awfully lucky to get all those flowers this time of year.
- Yes, indeed, we were.
- Say, Operator, where did you say Miss Francis was?
- Hey, Eddie.
- Nice to see you.
Miss Francis! I didn't recognize you for a moment. You look so exotic.
I have an important message for you from general headquarters. It's very urgent.
- Thanks, Eddie.
- How are you, Padre?
- May I?
- Don't mind me. Please read it.
Thank you.
Not too disagreeable, I hope.
Oh, no. Not disagreeable at all.
Just a-Just a little surprising, that's all.
- Would you excuse me just a moment, please?
- Yes indeed.
Thank you.
- So I said to the general-
- I'll say you did, and how!
Listen.
"This will inform you that your request has been favorably received by the War Office... and permission granted to proceed to North Africa."
- North Africa?
- Whose request?
Well- Well, all I said was I-
Oh, why don't I keep my big mouth shut?
When do we go?
"Hold yourselves in readiness for further instructions. Do not leave London."
- Do not leave London?
- Good-bye, Stratford. That's out.
I'm- I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.
Look, Carole, I got you into this, but I'll get you out.
- I'll go to the general and tell him-
- No, no, honey.
We probably won’t leave for a couple of weeks anyhow.
We'll still have time for our honeymoon.
I suppose they have bridal suites in London hotels.
- I'll telephone the manager.
- All right, honey.
Look, Carole.
Why don't you stay here in England?
After all, this is your honeymoon.
You forget I'm in the army too.
And, well, if other women can give up their sweethearts and husbands, I guess I can.
But there's no sense in giving him up before you have to.
- Yeah. Why don't you and Ted slip away right now, huh? - Sure. Say good-bye.
We're all set, honey- parlor, bedroom and bath. Suite 410 on this floor.
- Oh, wonderful.
- Good-bye, honey. Good luck!
- Bye.
- Good-bye, everybody.
- Bye!
- Oh, girls. Get ready. Here comes the bouquet.
Okay? Set!
Congratulations!
Oh, Mitzi! Wonderful! Good! Bye.
I've never been that lucky.
- Oh!
- Oh!
- Oh, Miss Francis.
- What now, Eddie?
- Another message from headquarters.
- Oh, thanks.
- Maybe they changed their minds.
- Yeah.
"You'll report to the War Office at 4:00 this afternoon... ready to leave immediately for your destination."
4:00? Well, it's almost 3:00 now.
Gosh. How will we ever tell Carole?
- Oh, no.
- Eddie.
- Oh, no!
- Aw, come on, Eddie.
Not me.
I drive a jeep, girls. Sorry.
Keep up to him. Walk a little faster.
- You all right, Martha?
- Yeah, I'm all right.
Here we go.
Hello. D.H.Q. 27. Go ahead.
What?
Yeah, yeah. Sure.
Look, you just stay right there, will you, and be real quiet?
Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, right away.
- Hey, Sarge.
- Yeah.
- You'd better send a relief up to Post 6.
- What's the matter?
The corporal's gone nuts. He just phoned in he saw Kay Francis there on a camel.
- Huh?
- Yeah.
Better turn out an ambulance, send relief to him quick. Probably the sun got him.
Hey, girls. This looks like a good place to stop. Let's stop here.
Hey, Frenchie. Hey. Free Frenchie.
Stop 'em right there.
Oops! Wait a second.
- Push, Bozo, push.
- Down! Down!
Hey! Down, you fools.
- Down, you fool, you!
- Take it easy. Hey, Frenchie.
- Take it easy, will you?
- When I was a kid, I wanted to join a circus.
Hey, Eddie, I take it all back.
- He's definitely here to stay.
- Get off all right?
- Hey, help her off, will you?
- Come on already.
- All right, are you, Carole?
- Yeah.
I love Jasper. I think he'd be a great character actor in Hollywood.
Hey, Frenchie. Get them away.
Take 'em back to Barnum and Bailey's.
- What about our luggage?
- I'll get it. Don't worry about it.
Don't be nervous, girls. Stay right-
I'll be right- Don't be nervous!
Break it up! Break it up, fellas!
- Hey, there they are!
- Hey! Hey!
- Hello, boys.
- Hi, fellas.
- Hello, Miss Francis.
- Hello, Sergeant. Can you tell us where we are?
I can't pronounce the name of this town, but it's in Africa, not far from the front lines.
- Where do we go?
- Nowhere. The military's using all the roads.
You'll have to stay here till the C.O. can send you back.
- In the meantime, where do we go?
- Get in this building.
But if the Jerries come over, there are some slit trenches outside the town.
Dive in them and stay there. You can't entertain anybody with your brains knocked out.
I guess he's never been to Hollywood.
- Eddie-
- The camels send you their love.
- Take them in there.
- Okay. Follow me, girls.
- Here we go again.
- Yeah.
- Where are you going?
- We were just going in-
Excuse me, ma'am- Uh, Lieutenant.
We were just going in there.
Get out. We've taken this place over for casualties.
Just a minute. I'm sorry, but we were told to come in here.
Our plane was forced down, and they brought us in on a camel caravan.
Who are you?
- Nobody.
- Red Cross?
- Well, uh, don't you recognize us?
- No. Who are you?
Excuse me, Lieutenant.
They're screen stars from Hollywood.
Well, it's a heck of an army.
We're short doctors, we're short nurses, we're short Red Cross workers... and they send us you queens from Hollywood.
- What for?
- Because we were asked to come to entertain the soldiers.
But if you're shorthanded, we'll be glad to do anything we can to help.
If you're not afraid of spoiling
your fingernails... there's plenty to do in here.
Well, look, Carole,
 you've taken first aid.
Martha and Mitzi,
you both learned auxiliary nursing... and I've worked for the Red Cross for months.
What are we standing here for? Come on.
Let's get going. Take care of the bags, Eddie.
- You said it.
- Okay.
Be right in.
Thanks.
- Another tray.
- Coming up.
- Kay.
- Yeah?
I don't think I can do it.
Oh, stop it, Mitzi. Pretend you're in Hollywood, you're working on a picture.
But... it's too real.
Sure, it's real, and it's real to those guys out there that are hurt.
They're not feeling sorry for themselves.
Oh, come on, honey. You're not gonna start acting like an actress.
There'll be another batch coming in.
Better get a couple minutes rest.
All right. Thank you, Doctor.
Oh, Nurse. Will you scrub up around here, please, right now?
There's a pail and brush there.
- Where will I start?
- Why, anywhere. There.
Yes, sir.
Miss Francis.
Forgive me. I didn't realize.
No, no, no.
Please, you can't do that.
What makes you think I can't?
I'm doing it.
But it- it's impossible.
- Why, you're an actress.
- Don't remind me.
No, no, no.
Please, please, please. No, no.
Ever since I first saw you,
I've wanted to tell you... that you're the most wonderful person I've ever known.
Well, for goodness sake. Couldn't you have found a better place to tell me?
I'm terribly sorry, but you don't understand, Miss Francis.
Uh, Doctor, just call me Kay.
May I really, Miss Kay?
Just plain Kay.
Oh, I say, that's- that's frightfully nice of you, Kay.
Well, why doesn't somebody say something?
All right. I take it back.
You're about the hardest-working batch of wenches I've ever met.
That's okay.
When we get over to the nurses' dugout, you can soak your feet, wash up and bunk there tonight.
- Good.
- But first we'll stop here.
- What for?
- A drink on the medical corps to pick you up.
- You've earned it.
- I could sure use one.
Well, personally,
I never touch the stuff.
Hey, Mitzi!
Mitzi.
- Oh, Dick!
- Dick, well, for goodness sake.
- When did you get here?
- Just a minute. How'd you girls get up here?
- On a camel.
- And we're still on a merry-go-round.
- Is Ted here too?
- Not yet, but he's trying awful hard to make it.
- Oh. Well, how is he?
- Fine.
- He made a mailman out of me too.
- A letter!
Uh-huh. He figured
I'd run into you in Africa... but I didn't think it'd be this soon.
And, oh, yes, he gave me something else for you too.
- What?
- Well, this was his idea.
- Oh!
- Don't blame me.
Girls! Here’s a table. We'd better grab it.
Bring the lieutenant along.
Well, thanks, but I've only got a couple of minutes and-
Well, uh, it was swell seeing you, Dick.
Yes. If you're around long enough, let's get together.
Bye!
Mitzi! Where you goin'?
- Nowhere.
- Well, stick with me. Come on, honey.
Gee, it's good to see you.
You look big time.
If you'd always said that to me in that way... we'd never have split up.
If you hadn't said some of the things to me that you didn't say that way... maybe we wouldn't have split up.
We'd probably'd been booked solid and gotten someplace.
Instead of split weeks in Weehawken,
Pottsville and Yonkers.
Gee, you used to sing to me when I was tired and wanted you to.
How many times
Do I have to tell you
That you're the person
That I adore
How many times
Do I have to tell you
And not repeat what I've said before
How many ways can I say I miss you
And skip the ever-familiar rhymes
How many times
Do I have to kiss you
Don't make it less
Than a million times
I've said over and over and over
And over again
That you are my one obsession
But I'd be willing to say it again
And again
If I thought it would make
An impression
How many dreams
Do I have to sell you
To make the one in my heart come true
How many times do I have to tell you
Before you know
I'm in love
With you
Well, come on, girls. Get your shoes off, while I rustle up hot water for you.
Don't go to any trouble.
You're just as tired as the rest of us.
- Forget it.
- I'm just full of vim, rigor and mortis.
Maybe we can find twin slabs to be laid out on.
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm thinking of Dick.
For heaven's sakes.
Love at a time like this?
Come.
- What do you want?
- Oh, excuse me, sir.
Um, ma'am. Lieutenant.
- What do you want?
- Nothing. I- Oh, Miss Francis!
Yes, Eddie.
Miss Francis, the fellas found out you girls were here... and, well, it'll be the last chance they'll have for your kind of a show.
- What?
- The C.O. gave permission, the fellas got everything ready.
- The guys kinda felt that you wouldn't turn them down.
- What are you talking about?
- They're half dead on their feet.
- Yes, sir- Uh, ma'am.
- Lieutenant. That's what I told the fellas.
- You're flack happy.
- Get out of here.
- Wait a minute, Eddie.
- What about it, girls?
- Okay by me.
- That's our real job.
- Sure. That's what we came here for.
Okay, Eddie. Tell the boys thanks for the invitation... and we'll get there just as soon as we can clean up.
Gosh, that's swell.
I was sure you would do it.
That's just the beginning.
She'll be back.
And now that little girl who sighs for you will sing for you.
Carole Landis!
Thank you.
Crazy me
Falling in love with you
I shouldn't be so crazy
But what am I to do
Crazy me
Hanging around your door
Well, I guess the army doesn't pay their bills either.
Quiet! Quiet. Quiet, men! Quiet!
The Jerries must be overhead, so that's it.
The girls can't work in the dark.
If it’s on account of the lights, we can fix that.
What's the matter with this?
Oh.
Okay, boys. Well, we've always been suckers for spotlights.
And with all of these, professor, music.
- Carry on, baby.
- All right, darling.
Crazy me
Falling in love with you
I shouldn't be
So crazy
But what am I to do
Crazy me
Hanging around your door
And asking every daisy
To tell me what's the score
How did I get this way
I want to shout "hooray"
I'm just a crazy fool
I guess
How did I get this way
Didn't I hear you say
Something that sounded so like "yes"
Can't believe
That what you say is true
To love someone so crazy
You must be crazy too
You must be crazy
Too
That's all, girls.
Sergeant Hart, you look after them.
- Yes, sir.
- You mean they'd kill us in cold blood?
- They're not gonna warm it up for us.
- Follow me, girls.
- Miss Raye, take my hand.
- Stop shakin', so I can grab it!
- This way, Miss Francis.
- Okay.
Let the girls through, fellas.
Is everybody here?
- Where's Mitzi?
- Mitzi!
Here I am.
The Jerries are dropping the flares!
Slit trenches! Come on!
- You all right, Carole?
- Yeah, I'm saying my prayers.
Keep going. I'm right with you.
Help! He's killing me! He landed right on my back! Help! He's killing me!
Hey, you! Help! Help! Help!
Miss Raye!
Oh, a wolf in a foxhole, huh?
Our orders have come through.
We move up at 1800 o'clock and counterattack according to Plan 4.
Any questions? Get to it.
Well, this is it.
- Mitzi!
- Dick!
Oh. That's the first time
 you ever kissed me.
Honey, you're the sweetest hunk of sugar in the world.
Oh. Do ya?
- Sure I do.
- Well, then say it.
All right.
I love you. But don't tell anyone
'cause it's a military secret.
Oh, I won't. I won't tell anyone.
All clear!
- Well, good-bye, honey. I gotta get going.
- All clear!
All clear! All clear!
- Wowee. I could do without some of that soon again.
- Oh, me too.
I was turning over in the grave they were digging for us.
- Yea!
- Hey, what's with you?
Oh, it's a military secret.
Dick loves me.
- Well, that's no secret.
- What about your war?
Oh, we're never gonna fight anymore.
I gave in without a struggle.
Well, come on. Let's get- Oh!
Where the heck have you been, chum?
Me? I was absolutely safe.
Eddie was a gentleman every minute.
Yeah, I had to be. I lost my glasses.
Isn't he a doll face?
Glad to see ya!
All right, ladies.
Now's your chance to get out.
Come on! There's no time to waste.
We'll get you to the rear line.
- You want us to leave now?
- After what we've been through?
- Well, we're staying here to watch the boys take off.
- You bet.
- What about you, Sergeant?
- Captain, sir, my orders are to go where the girls go.
Yeah. Come on.
Over hill, over dale
We have hit the dusty trail
And those caissons go rolling along
Countermarch, right about
Hear those wagon soldiers shout
While those caissons go rolling along
For it's hi, hi, hee in the field artillery
Call off your numbers loud and strong
One, two
And where ere we go
 you will always know
That those caissons are rolling along
[JAZZ PLAYING]
SORRY!
HELLO, MOM?
IT'S NICKIE,
YOUR SON NICKIE.
SO MUCH NOISE?
THERE'S NO NOISE HERE,
MOM.
HEY, LOOK, MOM,

ROMAN LAW.
R-O-M-A--
LOOK, MOM, I'LL EXPLAIN IT

NO, MOM,
I CAN'T BE HOME FOR DINNER.
WHAT, MOM?
I SAID ROMAN LAW, MOM.

GOOD-BYE!

IT'S ALL YOURS NOW.
Man: WHAT DO YOU MEAN THEY SENT
THE FOOD BACK? NOT IN MY PLACE!
DIDN'T YOU TELL 'EM THIS WAS
THE BEST JOINT IN ST. LOUIS?
THEY'LL EAT IT
AND LIKE IT!
HI-YA,
JIGGER! HI-YA!
SPIT IT OUT FOR ME,
KID, MEAN AND LOW!
HEY! YOU'RE
WITH ME!
LISTEN, STU,
IT'S BAD ENOUGH I HAVE TO DANCE WITH YOU,
I DON'T HAVE
TO LOOK AT YOU, TOO.
I DON'T LIKE
THAT GUY,
AND I DON'T
LIKE HIS MUSIC.
HEY, I DON'T
LIKE YOU,
AND I DON'T LIKE
YOUR MUSIC!
AW, DON'T BE
LIKE THAT!
Man: THAT'S WONDERFUL, JIGGER!
THAT'S TERRIFIC!
COME ON,
NOW MY FAVORITE!
BOOG IT, JIGGER,
BOOG IT FOR ME, BOY!
HEY, CRACKPOT, YOU'RE
NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.
PLEASE, JIGGER, COME ON,
JUST ONCE! FOR ME!
BOY, I COULD LISTEN
TO HIM BEAT OUT THOSE BLUES FOR HOURS!
THE BOSS CATCHES YOU HERE,
HE'LL BEAT 'EM OUT ON YOUR HEAD!
AW, JIGGER,
YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME HERE.
YOU COULD HAVE
A BAND OF YOUR OWN.
YOU ON THE PIANO,
PEPPI ON THE DRUMS, ME ON THE CLARINET,
AND MAYBE A FEW GUYS
THAT FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT MUSIC THAT WE DO.
I'M GOOD, JIGGER.
YOU KNOW I'M GOOD,
DON'T YOU?
LIGHT ME A CIGARETTE,
WILL YOU, KID?
OK, HERE'S YOUR BUTT.
HE DON'T LIKE ME.
AW, HE LIKES YOU.
HEY JIGGER,
YOU'RE BREAKING NICKIE'S HEART.
HE'S WORRIED YOU
DON'T LIKE HIM NO MORE.
SURE, I LIKE YOU, KID.
THEN WHY DON'T
YOU LISTEN TO ME?
I'M LISTENING.
I DON'T WANNA BE
A LAWYER, JIGGER.
I GOT 3 BROTHERS
WHO ARE LAWYERS--
THAT'S ENOUGH
FOR ONE FAMILY.
MY MOM OUGHT TO BE
SATISFIED WITH THAT.
ALL I WANNA DO
IS TO PLAY THE CLARINET.
Man: HEY, YOU!
CAN THAT MUSIC!
CAN IT, I SAID!
I GOT A REQUEST!
DO YOU KNOW,
I'M FOREVER BLOWIN' BUBBLES
LOOK, YOU JUKEBUG,
IF YOU DON'T PLAY
I'M FOREVER
BLOWIN' BUBBLES,
I'LL STUFF YOUR HEAD
INTO THAT PIANO,
AND I MEAN IT!
HEY, NICKIE,
GET JOE, GET THE BOSS.
THERE'S GONNA BE TROUBLE!
I KNOW JIGGER
WHEN HE'S QUIET LIKE THIS.
PRETTY SOON, HIS LEFT HAND
IS GONNA PLAY A TREMELO.
THEN THERE'S GONNA BE
A BIG FIGHT AND SOMEBODY'S GONNA GET HURT!
HURRY!
HEY, JOE!
YOU BETTER COME QUICK!
OH, YOU AGAIN,
THE JAZZ CRAZY LAW STUDENT,
THE GUY THAT
NEVER BUYS! OUT!
LATER, LATER!
NOT NOW. THE TREMELO!
WHAT TREMELO?
DON'T TRY TO GIVE ME NO DOUBLE-TALK.
JIGGER, THE TREMELO!
THERE'S GONNA BE TROUBLE!
THIS IS THE LAST TIME
I'LL ASK YOU!
[WOMEN SCREAM]
WELL, JIGGER,
HERE WE GO AGAIN!
JIGGER HERE,
HE'S MINDING HIS OWN BUSINESS.
THIS DRUNK COMES OVER
AND INSULTS HIS MUSIC!
SO HE INSULTS
HIS MUSIC.
WHAT IS THIS,
CARNEGIE HA--
HEY, WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE?
I ASK THIS GUY
TO PLAY A NUMBER FOR ME,
AND THE FIRST THING
I KNOW, HE UP AND SOCKS ME.
IT'S NOT TRUE!
IT'S ALL HIS FAULT!
KEEP OUT OF IT!
HE STARTED IT!
YOU, PIANO PLAYER!
LISTEN TO ME!
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE
I TOLD YOU THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT?
THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT
EVEN IF HE SPITS IN YOUR FACE!
YOU HEAR THAT?
I'M THE CUSTOMER;
I'M ALWAYS RIGHT!
PLAY, MONKEY!
I'M FOREVER
BLOWIN' BUBBLES
HEY YOU!
WHAT KIND OF A TONE
I CAN GET OUT OF YOU!
[ALL YELLING]
OPERATOR!
OPERATOR!
GET ME
THE POLICE STATION!
Man, on radio:
CALLING CAR 19. RIOT CALL.
ST. LOUIS CAFE.
THAT IS ALL.
[SIREN WAILS]
HELLO, MOM?
THIS IS NICKIE. YOUR SON, NICKIE.
GUESS WHERE I AM,
MOM!
YOUR NAME?
JIGGER PINE.
NO, MOM,
YOU'RE WRONG! I'M IN--
[WHISPERING]
I'm in jail!
OCCUPATION?
MUSICIAN.
HEY, MOM! MOM!
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
NICKIE?
SHE HANG UP ON YOU?
NO, I THINK
SHE FAINTED!
HELLO, MOM?
AGE?
NO, MOM,
I'M NOT KIDDING.
I'M REALLY IN JAIL.
I GOT INTO A FIGHT.
LAST KNOWN RESIDENCE?
EVANSTON HOTEL.
HEY, LOOK, MOM.
I KNOW I SAID I WAS STUDYING.
MOM, I'LL EXPLAIN
IT ALL TO YOU WHEN YOU GET DOWN HERE.
THE CLARK AVENUE
POLICE STATION.
AND, MOM, BRING PLENTY
OF MONEY DOWN WITH YOU.
WELL--WELL,
YOU SEE, I'M HERE WITH SOME FRIENDS.
OK!
HEY, BOYS,
WE'LL BE OUT OF HERE IN AN HOUR.
I KNOW MY MOM.
Man:
THIS WAY.
I'M COMING,
SWEETHEART I'M COMING.
ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S ALL. TAKE THEM AWAY.
WELL, WHAT DID
I TELL YOU, BOYS?
DID I GET YOU
OUT OF HERE, HUH?
ST. LOUIS
FROM A JAIL WINDOW.
YOU KNOW, THIS IS
THE FIRST TIME I'VE HAD A GOOD LOOK AT THIS JOINT
SINCE WE GOT HERE.
WE'VE SEEN
A LOT OF TOWNS IN THIS COUNTRY
FROM JAIL WINDOWS,
HUH, JIGGER?
Nickie: WELL,
FROM NOW ON,
YOU GUYS ARE GONNA HAVE
AN AWFULLY TOUGH TIME GETTING RID OF ME.
HEY, YOU!
AM I SEEING DOUBLE, OR IS THAT JIGGER PINE?
PETE! PETE!
JIGGER! I WAS ASLEEP
WHEN I HEARD YOUR VOICE.
I THOUGHT I WAS HAVING
A PLEASANT DREAM.
WHY, YOU OLD SON OF A GUN,
AM I GLAD TO SEE YOU!
HEY, PEPPI, NICKIE.
THIS IS PETE.
MY FRIEND PETE.
Peppi: HI.
WE PLAYED 16 WEEKS
TOGETHER ONCE,
HOW ARE YOU?
IN DUBUQUE.
HE SLAPS
THE GREATEST DOGHOUSE
YOU EVER HEARD.
AH!
Man: QUIET!
PIPE DOWN!
HEY, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?
OH, WE GOT KICKED OUT
OF SOME 2-BY-4 CAFE.
HOW ABOUT YOU?
AH, IT'S LIKE
HOME TO ME.
NO SOONER DO
I GET OUT OF HERE,
THEN THAT EX-WIFE
OF MINE SICS THE BLOODHOUNDS ON ME,
AND IN I AM AGAIN.
OH, THINGS HAVE BEEN
BREAKING GREAT.
I JUST LOST ANOTHER JOB,
MY BASS FIDDLE
IS IN HOCK,
I GOT KIDNEY TROUBLE,
I NEED 25 BUCKS
TO SPRING ME FROM THIS STINKIN' JUG.
SURE, EVERYTHING
IS ROSY-POSY. YOU GOT A BUTT?
SURE.
LISTEN, JIGGER.
YOU SAY
YOUR FRIEND HERE PLAYS A GREAT BASS,
WELL, MAYBE
THIS IS IT.
MAYBE THIS IS
HOW WE START.
START WHAT?
AW, THIS WHACK IS ALWAYS
POUNDING ON ONE THING.
HE COMES INTO THE CAFE
ONE NIGHT,
AND EVER SINCE THEN,
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET RID OF HIM.
EVERY NIGHT,
HE KEEPS HYPING ME IN THE ARM
ABOUT COMING
TO THE BAND.
IT DON'T HAVE TO BE
A BIG BAND, JIGGER.
WE'LL CAN START OUT
WITH MAYBE 4 OR 5 PIECES,
BUT MAYBE WE
CAN CONNECT,
GROW REAL BIG,
HIT THE JACKPOT!
SAY, THAT DON'T
SOUND SO WORSE.
I BET I CAN RATTLE OFF
A HUNDRED NAME BANDS
STARTED OFF
JUST LIKE THIS:
SAY, THAT DON'T
SOUND SO WORSE.
A COUPLE OF GUYS
GET TOGETHER--
JIGGER,
MAYBE NICKIE IS RIGHT. WITH YOU WE COULD!
NO, WE COULDN'T.
WHY? WHY NOT?
WELL, IT'S GOTTA BE
OUR KIND OF MUSIC, OUR KIND OF BAND.
JIGGER--
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, PEPPI.
LOOK, WHAT YOU
GOT ON YOUR MIND TAKES A LONG TIME.
WELL, IT'LL
HAVE TO WAIT.
YOU THINK I
NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT STARTING A BAND BEFORE?
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT
LOTS OF TIMES.
I'M ALWAYS THINKING
ABOUT IT.
BUT IT'S GOTTA BE
OUR KIND OF MUSIC, OUR KIND OF BAND.
THE SONGS WE'VE HEARD
SINCE WE'RE KNOCKING AROUND THIS COUNTRY--
BLUES, REAL BLUES,
THE KIND THAT COME OUT OF PEOPLE.
REAL PEOPLE, THEIR HOPES
AND THEIR DREAMS,
WHAT THEY'VE GOT
AND WHAT THEY WANT.
THE WHOLE USA IN ONE CHORUS!
THE WHOLE USA.
AND THAT BAND--
THAT AIN'T GUYS JUST
BLOWIN' AND POUNDIN' AND SCRAPIN',
THAT'S 5 GUYS,
NO MORE,
WHO FEEL, PLAY, LIVE,
EVEN THINK THE SAME WAY.
THAT AIN'T A BAND--
IT'S A UNIT!
IT'S ONE GUY
MULTIPLIED 5 TIMES.
IT'S A UNIT THAT EVEN BREATHES
ON THE SAME BEAT.
IT'S GOT A KICK ALL ITS OWN
AND A STYLE THAT'S THEIRS
AND NOBODY ELSE'S.
IT'S LIKE A HAND IN A GLOVE,
5 FINGERS,
EACH THAT FITS
SLICK AND QUICK.
WHY CAN'T
WE HAVE THAT, HUH, JIGGER?
AW, TICKY IS GETTING
WHAT I WANT.
WE'VE GOT YEARS
TO BURN.
LISTEN, JIGGER,
JUST SAY THE WORD!
JUST SAY,
"ME, JIGGER PINE,
"I THINK THESE FELLAS
HERE--THEY'RE JUST WHAT I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR."
AND IF YOU DON'T THINK
SO, YOU SAY THAT, TOO.
DON'T GET YOURSELF
ALL STEAMED UP, PEPPI.
BEFORE, WHEN YOU
TOLD ME THIS,
I DIDN'T BELIEVE
WE COULD DO IT,
BUT NOW--
NOW I GOT A HUNCH!
TAKE IT EASY.
REMEMBER YOUR CHEST.
OH, FORGET
THE CHEST!
MAYBE RIGHT HERE
IN THIS JAIL,
A DREAM YOU GOT
HAD SPAWNED!
YOU'RE NOT WRONG
ABOUT US!
WE'LL DO ANYTHING
YOU SAY,
ALL YOU GOTTA DO
IS TELL US!
[COUGHING]
PEPPI!  PEPPI!
WE'RE GONNA HAVE THAT BAND,
PEPPI, AND YOU'RE GONNA BE THE DRUMMER BOY, PEP--
Man: HEY, QUIET!
LET A GUY SLEEP!
YELL FOR A DOCTOR!
YEAH.
A DOCTOR! A DOCTOR!
Man:
AW, SHUT UP, WOULD YOU?
SOMEBODY GET A DOCTOR!
Man: SHUT UP!
A DOCTOR!
WE GOTTA HAVE A DOCTOR!
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH THAT WHITE BOY? HAS HE GOT THE MISERIES?
OH, OFFICER!
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
MY FRIEND PEPPI
HERE JUST FAINTED. PLEASE GET A DOCTOR!
OK, KEEP
YOUR SHIRT ON.
AND HURRY!
WILL YOU PLEASE HURRY?
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
THAT UNIT, PEPPI!
ANYTHING YOU SAY,
PEPPI!
ONLY OPEN YOUR EYES!
PLEASE OPEN YOUR EYES!
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
I'M ALL RIGHT.
DON'T WORRY,
I'M MUCH BETTER NOW.
WE ALL GOT THE MISERIES
IN THE END. ALL OF US.
DON'T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE
WHAT YOU'RE IN FOR,
DON'T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE
WHERE THE JAIL IS,
IT COMES NIGHT,
YOU START TO THINKIN',
THEN THE MISERIES GET YOU.
SURE DOES.
THAT'S WHY
WE'RE ALL HERE.
Man:
HUSH YOUR MOUTH, MAN!
MY MAMA
DONE TOLD ME
WHEN I WAS
IN KNEE PANTS
MY MAMA DONE TOLD ME,
SON
OH, SHE SAID
A WOMAN'LL
SWEET TALK
AND GIVE YOU
THE BIG EYE
BUT WHEN THAT
SWEET TALKIN'S DONE
A WOMAN'S A TWO-FACE
A WORRISOME THING,
LEAVE YOU TO SING THE BLUES
IN THE NIGHT
YOU HEAR THAT, PEPPI?
IT'S GREAT.
SURE IS,
JIGGER.
THAT'S THE REAL MISERY,
AIN'T IT BOYS?
YOU COULD SURE
BEAT THAT OUT, COULDN'T YOU, JIGGER?
WE ALL COULD.
WE ALL WILL.
BOY, THAT'S THE BLUES.
THE REAL LOWDOWN NEW ORLEANS BLUES.
NOW THE RAINS
ARE FALLIN'
HEAR THAT TRAIN
A-CALLIN'
WHOO-EE
MY MAMA
DONE TOLD ME

LONESOME WHISTLE
BLOWIN' 'CROSS
THE TRESTLE
WHOO-EE
MY MAMA
DONE TOLD ME
A-WHOO-EE-DA-WHOO-EE
OL' CLICKETY-CLACK'S
A-ECHOIN' BACK
THE BLUES IN THE NIGHT
[TRAIN WHISTLE]
Chorus:
FROM NATCHEZ TO MOBILE
FROM MEMPHIS TO ST. JOE
WHEREVER THE 4 WINDS BLOW
I'VE BEEN IN
SOME BIG TOWNS
AND HEARD ME
SOME BIG TALK
BUT THERE IS
ONE THING I KNOW
A WOMAN'S A TWO-FACE
A WORRISOME THING
WHO'LL LEAVE YOU TO SING
THE BLUES IN THE NIGHT
[TRUMPET PLAYS]
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S ENOUGH. GIVE ME THE HORN.
HOLD ON
JUST A SECOND.
AFTER ALL, BARNEY,
IT'S MY HORN.
THE LEAST YOU
CAN DO IS LET ME PRACTICE ON IT.
LISTEN, YOU, I LOANED YOU
8 BUCKS ON THAT TWISTED CUSPIDOR, DIDN'T I?
YEAH, YEAH.
WHEN YOU GIVE ME
THE 8 BUCKS, YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT WITH IT.
YOU CAN EVEN USE IT
TO GARGLE OUT OF.
NOW GIVE ME THE HORN
BEFORE I TWIST IT AROUND YOUR NECK!
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
I YIELD TO BRUTE FORCE.
Man: COME ON, LEO,
HOW ABOUT FINISHING THE GAME?
OK. THE WORLD,
MY FRIENDS,
AS IT IS NOW CONSTITUTED,
STINKS.
TO PROVE MY POINT,
I OFFER YOU THE CASE OF BARNEY AND MYSELF.
ON THE ONE HAND, A FINE,
SENSITIVE MUSICIAN. AN ARTIST.
ON THE OTHER HAND,
A DUBIOUS INDIVIDUAL NAMED BARNEY.
A THROWBACK
TO THE STONEAGE.
A STONE IN HIS HEAD,
A STONE IN HIS HEART,
A CROSS BETWEEN A GORILLA
AND A SNAKE.
Man: LISTEN,
YOU LOUDMOUTH--
NOW, NOW, BARNEY,
THERE'S NOTHING TO GET SORE ABOUT.
MY REMARKS ARE
STRICTLY IN PER--
WELL I'LL--
HELLO, CHISELER.
GLAD TO SEE YOU,
TOO.
3 YEARS AGO, WHEN WE PLAYED
THAT RATHOLE IN DES MOINES,
YOU PUT THE "B" ON ME
FOR 5 BUCKS. HOW ABOUT IT?
HOW DO YOU LIKE THIS GUY?
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM FOR 3 YEARS.
THE FIRST THING
HE THINKS ABOUT IS A MEASLY 5 BUCKS.
WHY DON'T YOU
ASK ME HOW I AM,
HOW I FEEL,
WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING?
HOW ARE YOU?
HOW DO YOU FEEL?
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING?
HAVE YOU GOT
THE 5 BUCKS? NO.
HAVE YOU GOT
A JOB? NO.
DO YOU WANT TO
GO TO WORK?
I DON'T WANT TO,
BUT I HAVE TO.
WE'RE STARTING
A UNIT.
YOU AND 10,000
OTHER MUSICIANS.
THIS UNIT IS GONNA
BE DIFFERENT!
YEAH, WHY?
BECAUSE WE'RE GREAT!
YOU AIN'T MODEST.
HEY, LOOK,
WHY SHOULD WE LIE?
I'M HERE TO SAY
THIS BOY PLAYS THE MUSIC BOX
IN THE MOST
TERRIFIC FASHION.
AND I MEAN TERRIFIC.
YOU'RE HERE TO SAY?
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU MATCH HIS STYLE
AND OUR UNIQUE METHODS OF PRESENTATION,
AND WE GOT THE MAKINGS OF
A GREAT LITTLE BAND,
AND I KNOW!
YOU KNOW, EH?
YES, I KNOW. YOU SEE,
I'M A STUDENT OF JAZZ.
A WHAT?
A STUDENT OF JAZZ.
I KNOW THE ANATOMY OF SWING.
NOT ONLY MUSICALLY,
BUT THEORETICALLY.
I'VE READ EVERYTHING
FROM LE JAZZ HOT  TO DOWNBEAT.
AH, YOU'LL FIND OUT
FOR YOURSELF.
AS THE LATINS SAY,
RES IPSI LOCA TUA.
WHAT'S THAT?
WELL, ON THE SIDE,
I'M A STUDENT OF THE LAW.
MOSTLY,
I PLAY THE CLARINET.
YEAH? HOW DO YOU
DO ON A HARP?
WELL, AS
A MATTER OF FACT,
THE POSSIBILITIES
OF THE HARP FOR SWING MUSIC
HAVE NEVER BEEN
FULLY EXPLOITED.
OH, LEO! LEO!
OH, THAT'S THE WIFE.
HEY, HOLD THIS FOR ME, WILL YOU, BUD?
STICK AROUND, PETE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
HEY, DON'T GO
TOO FAR OFF.
WE HAVE SOME VERY IMPORTANT
DECISIONS TO MAKE.
HELLO, BABY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING DOWN HERE?
HOW MANY TIMES
I TELL YOU I DON'T WANT YOU
COMING DOWN TO
THE POOL ROOM LOOKING FOR ME?
ALL RIGHT, I FORGIVE YOU THIS TIME.
OH, BUT--
MAKE WITH THE LIPS.
COME ON, BABY,
GO INTO YOUR SONG.
NOW?
YEAH, NOW.
MAKE IT LOUD.
I GOT GREAT NEWS
FOR YOU, BABY, WE GOT A JOB!
A JOB? CHARACTER, BABY.
YOU'RE WONDERFUL!
OH, I ALWAYS KNEW
I COULD DEPEND ON YOU!
CONTINUE, CLARK.
YEAH, IT'S A 5-PIECE
RADIO RECORDING FOR 50 BUCKS
WITH ME
ON THE VOCAL!
DID YOU HEAR THAT,
BARNEY?
LET ME HAVE MY HORN,
WILL YOU?
8 BUCKS ON THE LINE.
WE GET THE MOOLA
FOR THE JOB AS SOON AS WE FINISH PLAYING.
NOW, COME ON, BARNEY,
COOPERATE, WON'T YOU?
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TRUST YOU FOR HALF.
GIVE ME 4 BUCKS,
YOU CAN HAVE THE HORN.
LISTEN, DREAMFACE,
I GOT US A JOB,
AND WITHOUT HIS HORN,
WE DON'T COLLECT.
HOLD IT, BABY,
I GOT AN IDEA.
HEY, UH, PIANO!
THE NAME IS JIGGER.
TO ME, NAMES AIN'T
IMPORTANT. YOU GOT ANY MOOLA ON YOU?
YEAH, ABOUT 5 BUCKS
BETWEEN US. WHY?
THE ANSWER IS NO!
YOU'LL GET IT BACK
AS SOON AS I FINISH PLAYING THIS JOB.
I'M A DIFFERENT GUY NOW.
I'M REFORMED.
I TURNED HONEST, DIDN'T I, CHARACTER?
DIDN'T I,
CHARACTER?
YEAH,
HE TURNED HONEST.
IF YOU WAS WEARING
A HALO AND WINGS--
GIVE HIM THE 4 BUCKS.
HEY LISTEN,
JIGGER... YEAH!
3 1/2 OF THIS 5 BUCKS
IS FOR BUS FARE.
WE GOTTA GET TO THAT
BARNDANCE BY 10:00. IT'S OVER 50 MILES!
I KNOW THIS GUY.
HE'S A SNAKE. DON'T TRUST HIM.
LOOK, I'M
THE BUSINESS MANAGER OF THIS OUTFIT,
AND IT IS
MY JUDGMENT TO SAY NO.
GIVE HIM THE 4 BUCKS.
THE GUY IS A MUSICIAN. HE NEEDS HIS HORN.
YEAH. YEAH.
OK, SWEETHEART,
BUT THIS 4 BUCKS HAD BETTER COME BACK!
COME ON, COME ON,
AS THE LATINS SAY, "SHELL OUT!"
FRANKLY,
THIS HURTS.
THANK YOU.
HERE'S YOUR DOUGH,
GREEDYPUSS. GIVE ME MY HORN.
OK, WISEGUY,
BLOW YOUR BRAINS OUT.
THAT LEAVES US
A BUCK TO EAT ON
INSTEAD OF
A BUCK AND A HALF.
FOOD?
[JAZZ PLAYING]
HEY, JIGGER,
WHAT A TOWN THIS NEW ORLEANS IS!
JUST LISTEN
TO THOSE BOYS!
SHUT UP,
WILL YOU?
HEY, TRUMPET,
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
CAN'T YOU SEE
I'M BUSY?
FOR MY DOUGH, I'D
RATHER HAVE BETTER FOOD AND LESS MUSIC.
I'D TRADE 'EM ALL
FOR A GOOD T-BONE.
BOY, THEY'RE
WONDERFUL.
THAT'S WHAT
I MEAN, JIGGER, THAT KIND OF BEAT.
GOSH, TO BE ABLE
TO PLAY LIKE THAT!
THEY'RE NOT
SO HOT.
YOU BEEN SHOOTING
YOUR MOUTH OFF ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS.
I REPEAT,
THEY'RE NOT SO HOT.
I COULD STEP IN
THE MIDDLE OF THAT AND PICK UP THE BEAT
AND BLOW 'EM
ALL RIGHT OUT OF THE JOINT.
WHY DON'T YOU DO IT?
HUH? WELL, I DON'T
PLAY FOR DARES.
I GET PAID FOR
BLOWING MY HORN. I'M A PROFESSIONAL.
I'M BEGINNING TO
THINK YOU'RE A PHONY. LET'S SEE YOU DO IT.
YEAH?
OK.
NOT TOO MUCH APPLAUSE
WHEN I FINISH.
ANYBODY GOT
A CIGARETTE?
Pete: YOU'RE
THE FIRST GUY THAT EVER
MADE HIM PLAY
FOR NOTHING, JIGGER.
HEY, YOU'RE OK.
NEXT TIME I TELL YOU
I CAN DO SOMETHING,
YOU BETTER TAKE
MY WORD FOR IT.
YEAH,
MAYBE I WILL.
COME ON, CHARACTER,
LET'S GET GOING.
SO LONG, BOYS,
NEXT TIME YOU COME
TO NEW ORLEANS,
DON'T BOTHER
TO LOOK ME UP.
HUH?
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE!
WHAT ABOUT
THAT RECORDING?
WHAT ABOUT
OUR 4 BUCKS?
WELL, IT'S
A FUNNY THING. YOU SEE--
IF YOU'RE GONNA SAY WHAT
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA SAY--
YOU'RE
A MIND-READER, PETE.
YOU MEAN,
THERE'S NO JOB?
WE'RE NOT
GONNA GO TO WORK LIKE YOU SAID?
YOU MEAN TO SAY
HE TOOK OUR LAST DOUGH?
LET ME AT HIM!
HEY, BOYS--
WAIT A MINUTE,
YOU GUYS ARE
TAKING THIS THING
TOO SERIOUSLY.
OH, LEO, IF YOU GOT
A CRACK IN THE NOSE
COMING TO YOU, TAKE IT.
SISTER,
HE'S GONNA GET IT.
PETE,
LEAVE HIM ALONE.
ANY GUY CAN
PLAY THE HORN THE WAY HE DOES
CAN OWE ME
400 BUCKS.
AW, JIGGER--
OK.
JIGGER!
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE, BABY.
TAKE IT EASY.
AFTER ALL, HOW FAR
CAN GRATITUDE GO?
[LAUGHTER]
FROM NATCHEZ TO MOBILE
HEY, CHARACTER!
HI DIDDLE-DEE
DUM DUM DUM
SO WHAT IF WE'RE
BUSTED, CHUM?
HANG ON TO
YOUR LIDS, KIDS
HERE WE GO AGAIN,
YEAH, MA'AM
SO WHAT IF WE'RE
ON THE CUFF
AND FRESH OUT
OF THINGS AND STUFF?
HANG ON TO
YOUR LIDS, KIDS
All:  HERE WE GO AGAIN
WHY SAY THAT
WE'RE ON THE ROPES?
I SAY
WHAT DO YOU SAY, GIRL?
HANG ON TO
YOUR HOPES, DOPES
SO WHAT IF
WE'RE IN A SPIN
THAT'S REALLY
WHERE WE CAME IN
WE'RE LIVING,
AND IF THAT AIN'T TIN,
HANG ON TO
YOUR LIDS, KIDS
HERE WE GO AGAIN
HI DIDDELY DUM DUM DUM
MOVE OVER THERE,
HERE WE COME
HANG ON TO YOUR
CAPIES, CHAPIES!
HERE WE GO AGAIN
HOLD SOLID!
SO MAYBE WE GOT NO MOVES
UMM-HMM!
SOME CARS ARE THE SAME WAY, TOO
OHH!
HANG ON TO
YOUR TOPS, POPS!
HERE WE GO AGAIN
RIGHT TURN!
WHY CRY WHEN
WE HIT THE CURB
WE CRY
GIVE IT, BOY!
HANG ON TO YOUR TURB,
HERB, BABY!
BEN FRANKLIN ONCE SAID IT ALL!
WHAT'D HE SAY, BOY?
DIVIDED, WE'VE
GOT TO FALL!
UNITED,
WE'LL HAVE A BALL
HANG ON TO
YOUR LIDS, KIDS
HERE WE GO AGAIN
HERE WE GO AGAIN
ALL RIGHT, FELLAS, LET'S TRY IT
AGAIN FROM THE SECOND CHORUS.
TAKE IT EASY,
JIGGER,
IT TAKES ENERGY
TO BLOW THIS HORN. I'M HUNGRY!
OK, FORGET
ALL ABOUT IT. TIME OUT FOR LUNCH.
HEY, CHARACTER,
WHAT'S ON THE MENU?!
THE MENU,
MY FRIENDS,
IS IN STRICT ACCORDS
WITH THE STATE OF OUR PURSE.
SPEAKING
OF OUR PURSE,
HOW'D WE MAKE OUT
IN THAT LAST TOWN?
WE PLAYED TO A TUNE
OF EXACTLY $7.43.
THAT'S JUST ROSY POSY,
VERY ROSY POSY.
HEY, WE'RE
IMPROVING.
I CAN REMEMBER
SOME TOWNS
WE DIDN'T GET
PAID OFF AT ALL.
COME ON, DIVIDE,
MAKE WITH THE MOOLA.
HEY, CHARACTER,
HOW 'BOUT THAT COFFEE?
IT'LL BE READY
IN A MINUTE.
IN THE MEANTIME,
SOMEBODY OPEN--
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
BABY?
NOTHING, JUST THE
ROCK OF THIS TRAIN
MAKES ME
A LITTLE DIZZY.
YEAH, WELL, DON'T
THINK ABOUT IT.
MY STOMACH'S DOING
NIP-UPS, TOO.
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH THE KID?
WHY DON'T YOU
LIE DOWN, CHARACTER, YOU'LL FEEL BETTER.
OH, I'LL BE
ALL RIGHT IN A MINUTE.
YOU GONNA
BREAK IT TO LEO?
OH, I CAN'T,
JIGGER.
OH, I THINK YOU
GOT LEO ALL WRONG.
HE'S WACKY
IN A LOT OF WAYS,
BUT HE'S
A PRETTY DECENT GUY.
I NEVER HEARD
YOU SAY ANYTHING
DIFFERENT ABOUT
ANYONE, JIGGER.
BUT YOU KNOW HOW
LEO'S ALWAYS TALKING
ABOUT HOW HE
DOESN'T WANT ANY RESPONSIBILITIES.
HE WANTS
TO FEEL FREE,
AND IF I TOLD
HIM I WAS GONNA HAVE--
WELL, I COULDN'T
TELL HIM, JIGGER.
WELL, IF THAT'S ALL,
IF YOU WANT ME TO, I'LL TELL HIM.
OH, NO,
JIGGER, DON'T.
YOU DON'T
KNOW LEO THE WAY I DO.
HE'S LIABLE TO
TAKE A POWDER.
AND I DON'T
WANT THIS UNIT TO BREAK UP;
IT MEANS
TOO MUCH TO YOU.
IT DOESN'T MEAN
A LOT TO ALL OF US?
YEAH, YOU GOT
NO IDEA HOW MUCH.
YOU KNOW, UP
TO 8 MONTHS AGO,
BEFORE WE
STARTED THIS,
ME AND LEO WERE
WALKING AROUND IN CIRCLES.
GOING NOWHERE
AND GETTING THERE FAST.
NOW FOR THE FIRST
TIME WE BELONG TO SOMETHING,
GOT SOMEWHERE TO GO
AND SOMEONE TO GO THERE WITH.
I GOT A FEELING
IF I EVER LOST THAT I'D BE SUNK.
WHY SHOULD
YOU LOSE IT?
OH, I DON'T
KNOW, JIGGER,
BUT SOMEHOW
I GOT A FEELING THAT MAYBE--
MAYBE THINGS
MIGHT NOT WORK OUT THE WAY THEY SHOULD.
AW, THEY'LL WORK OUT.
WE'LL MAKE 'EM WORK OUT.
WILL YOU, JIGGER?
SURE, CHARACTER.
YOU REMEMBER
WHAT YOU SAID BEFORE ABOUT NOT BEING ALONE?
WELL, THAT'S IT,
CHARACTER, YOU'RE NOT.
WHENEVER
THE GOING GETS TOUGH, JUST SING OUT,
AND I'LL BE THERE.
I KNOW YOU WILL.
AND REMEMBER,
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,
STAY IN THE GROOVE,
WILL YOU?
I'M BACK
IN IT NOW.
[TRAIN WHISTLE]
WE'RE COMING INTO A TOWN.
I BETTER CLOSE THE DOOR.
HEY, BUDDY, GRAB
AHOLD OF MY ARM!
CLOSE THAT DOOR.
I SAID CLOSE
THE DOOR!
HEY, WHERE'S THIS
RATTLER HEADED FOR?
PITTSBURGH,
I GUESS.
HEY, JIGGER, HOW 'BOUT
A CHEESE SANDWICH, HUH?
HAVE SOME BEER,
FELLA.
OK, I GUESS
WE'RE OUT OF TOWN.
YOU CAN OPEN
THE DOOR NOW.
THERE'S NO AIR
IN THIS CRATE.
HEY, BUDDY, WHY
DON'T YOU GO OVER AND GRAB A BITE.
HERE.
WHERE YOU HEADED
FOR, BUDDY?
NONE OF
YOUR BUSINESS.
NO, I GUESS
IT AIN'T.
GIMMIE ANOTHER ONE,
WILL YOU, PEPPY?
SURE.
HEY, NICKIE,
YOU WERE JUST GONNA
DIVVY UP THE MOOLA.
OH, YEAH. IT'S $1.40
APIECE FOR EACH OF YOU GUYS--
ALL EXCEPT ME.
WHY EXCEPT YOU?
WELL, I TELEPHONED
MY MOM LONG DISTANCE.
Man: HEY, YOU.
HAND OVER
THAT DOUGH.
COME ON, COME ON,
HAND IT OVER!
[TRAIN WHISTLE]
[BELLS RINGING]
[TRAIN STOPS]
OH, IT'S YOU.
STILL RIDING THE
BOXCARS, EH, BOYS?
HOW ARE YOU?
FINE, HOW ARE YOU?
FINE. LAST TIME I SAW
YOU WAS ABOUT 3 MONTHS AGO.
ARE YOU GONNA
KICK US OFF?
NO, YOU CAN RIDE
THROUGH ANYTIME.
ONLY DON'T TOOT
THOSE HORNS SO LOUD.
LAST TIME,
YOU NEARLY LOST ME MY JOB.
WELL, SO LONG.
SO LONG. GOOD-BYE.
WELL,
HE'S A NICE...
HEY, YOU.
[MOANS]
HEY, YOU, I'M
TALKING TO YOU!
YEAH, WHAT
DO YOU WANT?
YOU GUYS COULD
HAVE TURNED ME IN.
WHY SHOULD WE?
WELL,
I STUCK YOU UP FOR $5.60.
IT'S ONLY MONEY.
SURE, IF YOU'D
TRIED TO TAKE OUR INSTRUMENTS AWAY,
WE'D HAVE BEATEN
YOUR BRAINS OUT.
FORGET IT.
WE'VE BEEN BROKE AND HUNGRY, TOO.
YOU PROBABLY NEED
IT MORE THAN WE DO. GOOD NIGHT.
HEY, YOU GUYS.
HEY, LOOK, MISTER,
WE WANT TO SLEEP.
FOR CRYING
OUT LOUD!
WHAT DO YOU
WANT NOW?
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHAT?
I LIKE YOU.
Jigger: DON'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT THE NAME OF THE PLACE,
BUT I GUESS THIS IS WHERE
HE WANTED TO MEET US.
Leo: THE JUNGLE.
I WONDER WHAT KIND
OF ANIMALS THEY GOT IN THERE.
FROM THE LOOKS
OF THE JOINT,
I'D SAY IT
WAS TERMITES.
WELL, ANYWAY,
IT AIN'T FAR FROM NEW YORK.
SUPPOSE WE'LL
EVER GET THERE?
IT DON'T LOOK LIKE
MUCH OF A SWIM.
Leo: YEAH? WELL, IF
WORSE COMES TO WORSE,
WE CAN ALWAYS USE
YOUR BASS FIDDLE FOR A RAFT
AND PADDLE ACROSS
WITH THE BOW.
WE DON'T HAVE
TO GET TO NEW YORK.
IF DEL DAVIS'
IDEA WORKS OUT, WE LAND THE JOB,
NEW YORK'S GONNA
COME OVER HERE TO HEAR US PLAY.
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
JIGGER?
SURE, THE WHOLE WORLD'S
GONNA HEAR US PLAY.
Leo: HEY, YOU BETTER BUTTON
YOUR COATS--KIND OF CHILLY.
Jigger: WELL, BOYS,
HERE WE GO AGAIN.
Leo: YEAH,
HERE WE GO AGAIN.
[WHISTLING HERE WE GO AGAIN]
HERE WE GO AGAIN
[WHISTLING THE TUNE]
HEY, WHAT KIND
OF ROADHOUSE IS THIS?
NOT EVEN
A CUSTOMER.
NOT EVEN
A WAITER.
NOT EVEN
A TERMITE.
I TOLD YOU, YOU
NEVER SHOULD HAVE TRUSTED
THAT GUY
IN THE FIRST PLACE.
YEAH, SO YOU MEET
A LUG IN A BOXCAR,
AND HE GIVES YOU
A SONG AND DANCE ABOUT A ROADHOUSE.
I STILL TRUST HIM.
YEAH, YOU ONCE
TRUSTED ME, TOO.
SHUT UP, LEO.
HEY, LOOK, BOYS,
I THINK WE
GOT COMPETITION.
"SONGS UNIQUE."
I WONDER WHAT KIND
OF A CANARY THAT IS?
OUT OF TUNE. [WHISTLES]
WAY OUT OF TUNE.
HI DIDDELY LE DUM DUM DUM
SO WHAT IF
WE'RE ON THE THUMB
HANG ON TO YOUR LIDS, KIDS
HERE WE GO AGAIN
Man: HEY, YOU.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
OH, WE HAD
AN APPOINTMENT TO MEET A GUY HERE.
FELLA NAMED DEL DAVIS
TOLD US TO ASK FOR SAM PARYAS.
WHO?
WHO DO YOU SAY TOLD
YOU TO COME HERE?
A FELLA NAMED
DEL DAVIS.
WE MET HIM BEATING
OUR WAY EAST IN A BOXCAR.
WELL, I THINK YOU
MADE A MISTAKE, BUDDY.
I DON'T KNOW
NO DEL DAVIS.
YOU GOT
THE WRONG PLACE.
Man: NOW, SAM,
NOW, SAM, YOU
KNEW THEY GOT THE RIGHT PLACE.
HELLO, KIDS.
HIYA, DEL.
GLAD YOU GOT
MY MESSAGE STRAIGHT.
I'M SORRY TO KEEP
YOU WAITING.
OH, YOU MUSTN'T
MIND SAM, YOU KNOW,
HE'S A GREAT KIDDER.
HA! ALWAYS WITH
THE DOUBLE TALK.
YOU NEVER GET
A STRAIGHT ANSWER OUT OF HIM.
WELL, SAM,
IT'S A NICE
PLACE YOU GOT HERE.
A LITTLE CRUMMY-LOOKING,
BUT IT'S HOMEY, SECLUDED,
YET NOT TOO FAR
FROM THINGS.
YEAH, SAM, YOU
ALWAYS HAD AN EYE FOR GOOD SPOTS.
NOW, LOOK, DEL--
LATER, LATER, SAM.
I'M HUNGRY.
SURE MY FRIENDS ARE, TOO.
AIN'T YOU, KIDS?
YEAH. SURE.
IS THAT THE KITCHEN?
YEAH.
COME ON,
LET'S GO, HUH?
AIN'T IT WONDERFUL
TO HAVE FRIENDS LIKE THAT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY?
[INDISTINCT TALKING]
Del: COME ON, KIDS,
DIG IN, HELP YOURSELF.
COME ON, SAM,
DON'T STAND AROUND, WE'RE THIRSTY, TOO.
ALL RIGHT.
WELL,
LOOK WHO'S HERE.
SO THEY STILL
GOT YOU HANGING AROUND, BRAD.
WELL, WELL, WELL...
YOU SHOULDN'T
SURPRISE US LIKE THIS, DEL.
YOU COULD OF AT LEAST
SENT US A PENNY POSTCARD, EH, SAM?
SHUT THAT BIG
TRAP OF YOURS.
BOYS, I WANT YOU
TO MEET ANOTHER FRIEND OF MINE.
LAST TIME I KNEW
HIM HIS NAME WAS AMES--BRAD AMES.
YOU HAVEN'T
CHANGED THAT, HAVE YOU?
Woman: BRAD!
WHERE DO YOU--
HELLO, KAY.
I HAD A TOUGH TIME
FINDING YOU.
STILL SOME
CRATES OUTSIDE.
DON'T EXPECT ME
TO BRING 'EM IN, DO YA?
Brad:
ALL RIGHT, KAY.
STILL SHARP
AS A WHIP.
YOU KNOW, SHE'S REALLY
A GOOD-LOOKING DAME WHEN'S SHE'S DRESSED UP?
SHE'S GOT CLASS,
STYLE, VERSATILE,
SHE DOES ANYTHING,
EVEN SINGS.
CAN I HELP YOU?
THANKS, I'LL DO IT MYSELF.
MY INTUITION TELLS ME
THAT'S THE SONG'S UNIQUE DAME.
MY INTUITION TELLS ME
WE NEVER SHOULD HAVE COME HERE.
WELL, I'M
NOT SO SURE.
WHAT DO YOU SAY,
JIGGER?
Del: YEAH, BOY,
SHE'S REALLY GOT A LOT OF TALENT.
WAIT TILL YOU
GET TO KNOW HER.
AND ESPECIALLY WAIT
TILL YOU HEAR HER. AND HIM--
HE ACCOMPANIES HER
ON THE PIANO.
HE PLAYS JUST
AS BAD AS SHE SINGS. HA HA HA HA!
AH, WHAT'S
A MATTER, KAY,
AIN'T YOU
GOT NOTHING TO SAY TO ME?
AREN'T YOU GLAD WE'RE
BACK TOGETHER AGAIN!
ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY.
LIVING UNDER
THE SAME ROOF, EATING THE SAME FOOD--
HOW LONG YOU
GONNA STAY?!
OH, I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE A DAY, MONTH, YEAR.
THESE PEOPLE--WHAT
DO THEY WANT HERE?
THEY'RE MY FRIENDS.
YOU MEAN THEY'RE
GONNA STAY HERE, TOO?
MM-HMM.
FOR HOW LONG?
OH, AS LONG
AS THEY WANT.
Sam: NOW, WAIT
A MINUTE, DEL.
DON'T YOU THINK IT'LL BE CROWDED--
SHUT UP.
I DON'T WANT 'EM HERE.
I DON'T WANT ANYONE HERE.
THIS IS MY PLACE!
YOU MEAN
IT WAS YOUR PLACE.
JUST LIKE THAT?
MM-HMM,
JUST LIKE THAT.
SO, YOU COME IN HERE,
JUST LIKE THAT,
FRESH AS A DAISY.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
MY LIFE HAS BEEN LIKE SINCE YOU'VE BEEN AWAY?!
HOW EASY DO YOU THINK
IT'S BEEN FOR ME,
TRYING TO MAKE
A GO OF IT,
TAKING CARE
OF THAT CRIPPLE?!
TRAVELING WITH THAT
LAME-BRAIN STOOGE
YOU LEFT BEHIND YOU!
YOU THINK IT'S
BEEN TOUGH FOR YOU?!
HEY, DEL--
SO YOU SAT IN JAIL!
SHUT YOUR MOUTH!
DOES THAT MAKE A HERO OUT OF YOU?
SAM, GET HER OUT OF HER, WILL YA?!
LEAVE ME ALONE!
SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT, DEL,
YOU WON'T SAY ANY MORE, WILL YOU, KAY?
NOW LISTEN, THE SOONER
YOU GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD
THAT WHAT WANT AROUND HERE
DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE THE BETTER FOR YOU.
NOW GET OUT OF HERE.
I'LL GO OUT
BY MYSELF!
FRED!
YEAH?
YOU STAY HERE.
BUT, DEL--
SAM, YOU BETTER HAVE
A TALK WITH HER.
LET ME TALK TO HER.
I CAN HANDLE IT.
YOU KNOW THE WAY
SAM IS.
WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING AROUND FOR?
SORRY, FOLKS,
JUST A LITTLE MISUNDERSTANDING.
HAPPENS IN
THE BEST OF FAMILIES.
LOOK, KIDS, I THINK
WE BETTER SCRAM.
NO, SIT DOWN,
SIT DOWN.
THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE WORRIED ABOUT.
DON'T FORGET DEL DAVIS
IS TAKING CARE OF YOU.
HEY, BRAD,
YOU HANG AROUND
A WHILE.
AS SOON AS WE
FINISH THIS GRUB,
YOU CAN SHOW MY FRIENDS
TO THEIR ROOM.
Brad: NOW HERE YOU ARE.
DON'T EXPECT TOO MUCH.
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE GONNA LIKE IT.
AT LEAST
I HOPE NOT.
JIGGER, THIS PLACE
GIVES ME THE CREEPS.
MAYBE WE BETTER
GET OUT OF HERE.
TAKE IT EASY,
CHARACTER,
A JOB'S A JOB.
THE JUNGLE--
NEVER HAVE I SEEN
A PLACE MORE
APPROPRIATELY NAMED.
WELL, WHAT ARE
YOU WAITING FOR?
YOU DON'T EXPECT ME
TO CARRY YOU IN, DO YOU?
Jigger: COME ON,
KIDS, LET'S GO.
YOUR ROOMS
ARE UPSTAIRS.
HEY, IF YOU WANT
THAT PIANO DEL PROMISED YOU,
YOU CAN DRAG IT
IN HERE YOURSELF.
HEY, BUDDY.
WHAT?
THAT DAME.
WHAT ABOUT HER?
I WAS GONNA ASK YOU,
SHE KINDA FLARES UP, DON'T SHE?
YEAH, IF YOU THINK SO.
WELL, I DON'T MIND.
I THINK THAT ANY DAME
THAT LOOKS LIKE HER
OUGHT TO FLARE UP ONCE IN A WHILE.
GIVES YOU STYLE,
CLASS, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
Character: LEO,
ARE YOU COMING?
YEAH, I'LL BE
RIGHT UP, HONEY.
TAKE THAT COMPLIMENT
FROM ME TO HER.
7. YOU HAVEN'T
LOST THE TOUCH, DEL, YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT.
SURE, WE CAN FIX UP
THIS RAT HOLE.
THAT BAND'LL
FIT IN PERFECT.
THIS IS A GOOD SPOT.
I GOTTA GIVE YOU CREDIT FOR THAT.
WE'LL DRAW THE MONEY
GUYS INSTEAD OF THE NICKEL NURSES.
I'M GONNA
PUT THIS JOINT ON A PAYING BASIS.
DEL, THAT'LL
TAKE MONEY.
TAKE IT OUT OF THE
DOUGH YOU OWE ME.
THAT'S ALL GONE.
I OUGHT TO KICK
YOUR TEETH OUT, YOU DOUBLE-CROSSING JERK.
I'LL GET THE MONEY, DEL.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.
7 AGAIN!
STILL GOT MY TOUCH.
WHERE DO I SLEEP?
KAY SAID YOU
CAN HAVE MY ROOM.
DOWN THE HALL,
THE FIRST DOOR ON THE RIGHT.
AND, DEL--
YEAH,
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
NO HARD FEELINGS,
DEL.
NO, SAM.
NO HARD FEELINGS.
DEL.
YOU OUGHTA HAVE
A LOT TO SAY.
LISTEN, DEL,
I AIN'T IN THE
MOOD TO LISTEN.
I LOST MY HEAD
DOWNSTAIRS.
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS SAYING.
HONEST, I DIDN'T--
I'M TIRED.
IT'S A LONG TIME
SINCE I HAD A GOOD NIGHT SLEEP.
WE WAITED FOR YOU,
BUT IT GOT TOO HOT.
EVERY DAY THE COPS
COME ROUND.
WRITE IT. WRITE IT OUT
AND MAIL IT TO ME,
I'LL READ IT
IN THE MORNING.
THEY KEPT ASKING
QUESTIONS.
WE COULDN'T STAY THERE
ANY LONGER.
ME, I COULDN'T
STAY IN THAT CELL ANY LONGER EITHER.
YOU BROKE OUT?
NO, I SADDLED A PIGEON
AND FLEW OUT.
WE WERE SCARED TO GET
IN TOUCH WITH YOU.
TWO MONTHS I BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU.
TWO MONTHS OF
HITCHING FREIGHTS,
STEALING CARS,
SLEEPING UNDER BRIDGES,
DUCKING COPS.
AND ONLY ONE THING WAS
ON MY MIND THAT WHOLE TIME.
TO PAY YOU AND SAM OFF
PERSONALLY.
AND IT'S STILL
ON MY MIND, TOO.
DEL, YOU CAN
TRUST ME, DEL.
I SAID TO SAM WHEN
WE FOUND THIS PLACE,
I SAYS,
DEL'LL LIKE THIS.
THIS IS JUST LIKE THE PLACE
WE HAD IN CALIFORNIA.
OH, YOU...
IF SAM TOLD YOU
DIFFERENT, HE'S LYING!
WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE KIDDING?
I TAKE THE RAP FOR
THAT JOB IN FRISCO.
I GET 10 YEARS,
SO YOU AND SAM GET MY SHARE.
[MOCKINGINGLY]
POOR, DEL, A 10-YEAR RAP.
HE'S GOT NOW USE
FOR MONEY THERE.
HO HO!
I KNOW YOU, YOU...
SURE, IN A LITTLE WHILE,
YOU'LL FREEZE SAM OUT,
THEN YOU'LL BE
RIDING HIGH LIKE YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO,
YOU AND THAT CRIPPLED
STOOGE OF YOURS.
WHY HE NEVER KNOCKED
YOU OFF BEFORE THIS I COULD NEVER FIGURE OUT.
SAY, MAYBE I CAN
TALK HIM INTO IT, EH?
NOW DON'T GET SORE,
BABY,
THAT WON'T GET YOU
ANYPLACE WITH ME.
GO ON, GET OUT
OF HERE--BEAT IT.
DEL,
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO
IF YOU'D OF SAID DEL THAT WAY TO ME,
YOU COULD HAVE WROTE
YOUR OWN TICKET, BUT NOT NOW ANYMORE.
I AIN'T LIKE BRAD.
I GET THINGS OUT OF MY SYSTEM ONCE AND FOR ALL.
NOW LIKE I TOLD YOU,
I'M TIRED. I WANNA GET SOME SLEEP.
Brad: KAY.
YOU SPYING
ON ME AGAIN?
I WAS WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.
WORRY
ABOUT YOURSELF.
HE DIDN'T HURT YOU,
DID HE, KAY?
IF I THOUGHT HE OR SAM
PUT A HAND ON YOU, I--
GET ME A DRINK.
YEAH...YEAH, KAY, RIGHT AWAY.
I PUT 'EM IN THE ROOMS
OVER THE GARAGE.
YOU PUT WHO
IN THE GARAGE?
THAT JAZZ BAND.
WHO?
THOSE PEOPLE DEL
BROUGHT WITH HIM.
I SAID GET
ME A DRINK.
AW, JUST
A SHORT ONE, KAY? NO.
[JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING]
WHAT GOES ON?
OH, IT'S THAT BAND.
GUESS THEY MUST
BE PRACTICING.
WHO ARE THEY ANYWAY?
WHAT'S WHAT BETWEEN
THEM AND DEL?
WHAT DO THEY GOT
ON HIM?
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
DEL JUST KEEPS ON TALKING
ABOUT HOW MUCH HE LIKES 'EM.
THEY SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT ME?
YEAH, THERE WAS ONE OF 'EM THAT TALKED ABOUT YOU.
WHICH ONE?
THE TALL ONE,
THE TRUMPET PLAYER,
I THINK THEY
CALL HIM LEO.
HE SEEMED KIND
OF INTERESTED IN YOU. YEAH?
I DON'T THINK
DEL'S GONNA LIKE IT.
OR MAYBE DEL DON'T
CARE ANYMORE, HUH?
WHAT GOES ON BETWEEN
ME AND DEL IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.
I TOLD YOU THAT
A LONG TIME AGO.
OK, DON'T GET SORE.
SMALL-TIME GAMBLER.
THAT'S ALL HE EVER WAS.
THAT'S ALL HE EVER WILL BE.
I NEVER CARED
FOR HIM ANYWAY.
NOW YOU DO,
DON'T YOU, KAY?
HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE I--
BUT YOU CAN'T
HAVE HIM, HUH?
YOU'RE SURE?
DEL'S LIKE YOU, KAY,
ONLY HARDER.
WHAT'D YOU SAY
HIS NAME WAS?
WHOSE NAME?
THE TRUMPET PLAYER.
OH, UH, LEO, I
THINK THEY CALL HIM.
HMM, IS THAT SO?
AND WHAT DID
HE SAY ABOUT ME?
NOTHING
IN PARTICULAR.
IT'S THE WAY
HE SAID IT.
NOT THAT
I BLAME HIM.
GIVE ME
A CIGARETTE.
HERE, HERE, KAY.
YOU SAID BEFORE
DEL WOULDN'T LIKE IT.
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
MAYBE HE WON'T.
Character:
SOMEWHERE, SOMEDAY
WE'LL BE CLOSE TOGETHER
WAIT AND SEE
OH, BUT AWAY
THIS TIME
THE DREAM'S ON ME
YOU'LL TAKE MY HAND
WHO'S THAT SINGING?
THAT'S HIS WIFE--
THE TRUMPET PLAYER.
THEY'RE MARRIED.
OH, THEY'RE MARRIED.
WELL, THEY TALK
LIKE THEY WAS.
AND YOU LOOK AT ME
GOOD NIGHT, BRAD,
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.
OK.
AS THINGS STAND
THIS TIME THE DREAM'S ON ME
IT WOULD BE FUN
TO BE CERTAIN
THAT I'M THE ONE
TO KNOW
THAT I AT LEAST
SUPPLY THE SHOULDER
YOU CRY UPON
TO SEE YOU THROUGH
TILL YOU'RE EVERYTHING
YOU WANT TO HEAR
IT CAN COME TRUE
BUT THIS TIME
THE DREAM'S ON ME
HEY, CHARACTER.
COME HERE.
YES, JIGGER.
I JUST WANNA SAY,
CHARACTER--
LIKE I TOLD YOU
ONCE BEFORE,
THAT YOU'RE
NOT ALONE.
REMEMBER
THAT YOU'RE ONE OF US.
NO MATTER WHAT
HAPPENS, JUST KEEP SAYING TO YOURSELF,
"I'LL NEVER BE ALONE
IF I STAY
IN THE GROOVE."
I KNOW WHAT
YOU MEAN, JIGGER.
TWO SCOTCH, 3 BOURBONS,
AND A BOTTLE OF FIZZ
WATER FOR UPSTAIRS.
TEX, HOW'S IT
GOING UP THERE?
BOTH THE CRAPS TABLES
ARE IN ACTION.
BIG GAME?
TOO BIG FOR YOU.
IS DEL
IN THE BACK ROOM? YEAH.
HOW ABOUT
THE SCOTCH?
COMING UP.
COMING UP.
SAM...
WHADDA YOU WANT?
HOW ABOUT
A SAWBUCK TILL MONDAY?
NO DICE.
I'LL TAKE A FIN.
YOU WANNA GET
IN THAT GAME UPSTAIRS.
NOT WITH MY DOUGH,
YOU DON'T.
COME ON, SAM.
YOU'LL GET IT BACK.
I WANNA GAMBLE,
I'LL DO IT MYSELF.
NOW, WILL YOU DO ME
ANOTHER FAVOR? SURE.
TAKE THE NEXT NUMBER
FOR ME?
I GOTTA SEE DEL.
IT'S KIND OF IMPORTANT.
ALL RIGHT.
REMEMBER, KID--
STAY IN THE GROOVE.
JIGGER.
JUST A MINUTE.
IF YOU'RE GOING
UPSTAIRS TO GAMBLE--
NO, BRAD,
I'M NOT GONNA GAMBLE.
AW, THAT'S TOO BAD.
HAD A LITTLE
PROPOSITION FOR YOU.
I THOUGHT WE'D GO HALVES.
I'M LUCKY WITH THE DICE.
SORRY.
JIGGER.
WOULD YOU LEND ME
SOME MONEY?
I FIGURE I GOT
A LUCKY STREAK COMING ON.
YOU KNOW, ONE
OF THESE DAYS I'M GONNA HAVE ENOUGH DOUGH TO--
AW, FORGET IT.
I KNOW HOW YOU GUYS
FEEL ABOUT ME.
WHY SHOULD YOU
LEND ME ANY MONEY?
HOW MUCH
DO YOU WANT?
OH, I DUNNO.
10 BUCKS.
ALL I GOT IS 6,
BUT YOU CAN HAVE THAT.
I HOPE YOU WIN.
THANKS, JIGGER.
I THINK
HE REALLY MEANS THAT.
BRAD! BRAD, WHY
AREN'T YOU AROUND HERE WHEN I NEED YOU?
I'M COMING,
SAM, I'M COMING.
Man: AND
YOUR BETS, PLEASE.
Man:
COME ON, LEO!
YEAH!
AND HE THREW A 7.
THAT'S LUCKY.
LET HER RIDE.
HERE ARE THE DICE, LEO.
WHO'LL RIDE
WITH THE WINNER?
THAT MAKES IT
3 IN A ROW.
NOW, COME ON.
WATCH ME, BABY.
LOOK WHO'S HERE.
HUH? WELL,
HELLO, GENIUS.
HERE WE GO.
TIME GO TO SCHOOL,
TEACHER?
ACEY-ACEY,
SNAKE EYES.
THAT'S TOO BAD,
YOU LOSE.
I SHOULD HAVE
KNOWN YOU'D BRING ME BAD LUCK.
HEY, BABY, PUT THIS
ON THE LINE FOR ME,
AND LAY IT
DOWN GENTLY,
BECAUSE THAT'S
ALL THERE IS.
LEO.
I KNOW, I KNOW,
THE BOYS ARE
WAITIN', MY WIFE IS SUFFERING.
COME ON, NOW,
COME ON.
Dealer: AND HE
ROLLED A 5.
YOU COMING
DOWN, LEO?
WHEN I GET
THROUGH WITH THIS ROLL.
Dealer:
5's THE CALL. 5's EASY,
ISN'T IT, HONEY?
COME ON, DICE,
COME ON FOR LEO,
THAT'S IT.
COME ON--
AND HE'S
SEVENED OUT.
NEXT MAN.
WELL, THAT'S IT,
16 BUCKS DOWN THE DRAINPIPE.
YOU HAPPY NOW?
NOW,
LISTEN, LEO.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
MY PUBLIC'S CLAMORING FOR ME,
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS
WITH US ARTISTS.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
AND HE THREW A 6.
DON'T YOU PLAY
IN THE SAME BAND?
I'D LIKE TO HAVE
A FEW WORDS WITH YOU.
NOW, TEACHER?
WHAT I HAVE TO SAY
WON'T TAKE VERY LONG.
WE GOT
SOME FRESH DICE,
NICE 'N HOT--
THROW 'EM IN.
ALWAYS GIVE
THE FOLKS A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY.
THAT'S WHAT
I BELIEVE.
HERE YOU ARE,
GENTLEMEN,
TAKE YOUR CHOICE.
LET'S GET AWAY
FROM HERE.
Dealer:
6 TO THE POINT. THEY DO OR THEY DON'T?
I'LL TAKE THE GAME
WHAT'S THE POINT? 6.
6 IS THE POINT.
YOU KNOW THIS
IS THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE SPOKEN TO ME
SINCE YOU'VE
BEEN HERE.
LOOK, LEO'S MARRIED.
YOU RUN
LEO'S LIFE? I RUN THIS BAND.
IS THAT
THE SAME THING?
WE ALL CAME UP
TOGETHER, THE HARD WAY--
I WOULDN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.
IT'S KIND
OF IMPORTANT WE STICK TOGETHER.
CHARACTER'S
LEO'S WIFE.
SHE'S BEEN
KICKED AROUND THE WAY WE WERE.
SWEATED TO GET HERE,
CULTIVATED HER VOICE ON ONE MEAL A DAY--
THERE'VE BEEN
TIMES WHEN I GOT ALONG ON LESS.
YOU SEEM TO THINK
IT'S A SPECIAL PRIVILEGE TO GET KICKED AROUND.
YOU'RE LUCKY,
YOU GOT FRIENDS, YOU GOT TALENT.
DON'T YOU THINK
I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SING LIKE WHATSHERNAME,
AND GET A CHANCE
TO DO SOMETHING?
I'M SORRY.
WELL, WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?
I WANT YOU TO KEEP
AWAY FROM LEO.
HE RUNS AFTER ME,
I DON'T RUN AFTER HIM.
ONE WAY OR
THE OTHER, MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME.
ALL I KNOW IS YOU'RE
BUSTING UP THE UNIT.
IS THAT ALL
YOU CARE ABOUT?
YEAH,
THAT'S ABOUT ALL.
WHAT KIND OF A DAME
PUSHED YOU AROUND?
WHAT'S THAT GOT
TO DO WITH THIS?
WHY HAVEN'T YOU SPOKEN
TO ME BEFORE?
WHAT STOPPED YOU?
YOUR PIANO?
Man:
HEY, JIGGER.
THEY WANT YOU
DOWNSTAIRS.
ALL RIGHT,
I'M COMING.
JIGGER.
NEXT TIME YOU
SEE ME, WILL YOU DO ME A FAVOR?
WILL YOU
AT LEAST SMILE?
Dealer:
6, AND A 6.
BOX, GUYS.
HE'S COMIN' OUT
IN A FRESH NUMBER,
FOLKS.
GET YOUR BETS DOWN.
EVERYBODY READY? HE'S--
6 AND A 4,
A 10...
YOU CAN TELL ME
LOVE'S A PHONY
A LOT OF BALONEY
BUT WAIT TILL IT
HAPPENS TO YOU
YOU CAN TELL ME I'M A DILLY
WHO'S JUST BEIN' SILLY
BUT WAIT
'TIL IT HAPPENS TO YOU
YOU CAN GIVE ME GOOD ADVICE
ABOUT PAYIN' THE PRICE
AND I'D BETTER FORGET IT,
YOU SAY
YOU'RE TALKING
THROUGH YOUR HAT...
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE,
CONVERSATION WITH MY MEALS.
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU GUYS, YOU GOT LOCKJAW?
YOU KNOW WHAT I'D
LIKE TO DO TO YOU, DON'T YOU?
OH, YEAH, I KNOW.
PETE THE STRONGMAN,
ALWAYS WITH THE MUSCLES.
I AIN'T TELLING YOU
ANYTHING WITH MUSCLES.
I'M TELLING YOU, LEO,
YOU'RE NO GOOD.
JUST PLAIN NO GOOD.
AND WHAT HE SAYS,
I SAY--ONLY TWICE AS LOUD.
OH, WHY DON'T YOU
LEAVE HIM ALONE?
IT'S NONE OF YOUR
BUSINESS, IT'S BETWEEN ME AND HIM.
YOU'RE GONNA GO
TO BAT FOR THAT JERK
AFTER THE WAY
HE'S BEEN HORSIN' YOU AROUND?
NOW LISTEN, YOU LAY OFF.
SHE'S STILL MY WIFE, NOT YOURS.
JIGGER, WHY DON'T
YOU SAY SOMETHING? YOU TELL HIM.
GEE, LEO--
WHY COULDN'T
YOU HAVE BEEN A LEGITIMATE GUY?
WHERE'RE
YOU GOING, CHARACTER?
OH, PLEASE, JIGGER,
LET ME GO.
I DON'T WANNA
BREAK THIS UP.
I CAN GET
ANOTHER JOB. I'LL GET ALONG.
LISTEN, CHARACTER,
YOU'RE STAYING.
YOU'RE PART
OF OUR UNIT, AND I WANT YOU TO STAY.
WHADDA YOU MEAN,
YOU WANT HER TO STAY? LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
WE'RE SICK AND TIRED
OF DOING WHAT YOU WANT US TO DO,
ORDERING US AROUND
LIKE A LOT OF SCHOOLGIRLS.
SURE IT'S OK FOR YOU,
YOU GOT CHORDS IN YOUR HEART INSTEAD OF FEELINGS.
OK. ARRANGE MY MUSIC,
BUT DON'T TRY TO ARRANGE MY LIFE FOR ME.
SO I HAD A FEW DRINKS
AND A COUPLE OF LAUGHS.
DID ANYBODY
GET HURT?
YOU ALL
THROUGH?
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO ARGUE WITH HIM FOR?
THE MUSCLER
WANTS TO GO, LET HIM GO.
WE NEVER SHOULD
HAVE TAKEN HIM ALONG
IN THE FIRST
PLACE.
NO, I WON'T LET HIM
GO. I THINK HE'S JUST SHOOTIN' OFF HIS MOUTH.
YOU THINK I WANNA SEE
THIS UNIT BUSTED UP,
AFTER THE WAY
WE'VE BEEN WORKING--
DRAGGING OURSELVES
THROUGH A WRINGER TO PLAY TOGETHER?
LISTEN, LEO,
YOU WALK OUT OF HERE,
AND I'LL BREAK
EVERY BONE IN YOUR BODY,
SO HELP ME,
I WILL.
YEAH? MAYBE
I BETTER--
LEO! DON'T!
PLEASE, DON'T.
CHARACTER!
CHARACTER,
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
PETE, QUICK,
A GLASS OF WATER.
WHAT'S THE MATTER, BABY?
SOMEBODY OPEN THAT WINDOW.
I DIDN'T MEAN IT,
I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT, HONEST I WOULDN'T, BABY.
YOU KNOW ME,
HALF THE TIME I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.
SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT,
SHE'S JUST A SICK GIRL.
SICK?
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HER?
SHE'S GOING
TO HAVE A KID.
YOU FEEL
BETTER, BABY?
OH, GEE, I'M GLAD.
HERE, HAVE ANOTHER DRINK OF WATER.
WHAT'RE YOU SAYING?
WHO'S GONNA--
IS THIS ON THE LEVEL,
CHARACTER?
YOU DON'T MEAN
YOU'RE GONNA--
IT AIN'T TRUE--
IT AIN'T.
YES, LEO.
I WISH IT WASN'T, BUT IT IS.
WHADDA YOU MEAN,
YOU WISH IT WASN'T?
AIN'T I ENTITLED
TO A KID, TOO?
WHAT ARE YOU
WORRIED ABOUT?
THIS IS GREAT,
THIS IS MARVELOUS.
WE'RE GONNA
HAVE A KID.
SHUT UP, WHADDA
YOU MEAN, WE?
OH, WAIT'LL
I CALL UP MY MOMMA
AND TELL HER
ABOUT THIS.
SHE'LL TELL YOU
JUST WHAT TO DO, CHARACTER.
THIS KID'S GONNA
BE AN EXTRA SPECIAL KIND OF KID.
SHE'S GONNA PLAY
ALL INSTRUMENTS.
BOY, DOES THIS CALL
FOR A CELEBRATION.
I'M BUYING THE DRINKS.
YEAH? YOU KNOW,
THE WORLD AS IT IS NOW CONSTITUTED STINKS.
ON THE ONE HAND,
YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF SWELL GUYS LIKE YOU,
ON THE OTHER HAND,
YOU HAVE A GUY LIKE ME,
THE LAST OF A LONG
LINE OF HEELS--
LEO THE RAT, A CROSS
BETWEEN A JERK AND A--
ALL RIGHT, LEO.
IT'S OVER NOW.
NO, NO, WAIT A MINUTE,
BABY, NOT YET.
YOU KNOW, PETE,
YOU SAID YOU'VE BEEN SAVING ONE UP FOR ME
FOR A LONG TIME.
I THINK YOU'D BETTER
LET ME HAVE IT, DO ME SOME GOOD.
YEAH.
I THINK SO, TOO.
OH, LEO,
ARE YOU HURT?
NO, BABY, I--
I FEEL BETTER ALREADY.
MUCH BETTER.
Sam: HEY,
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU GUYS?
DON'T YOU WORK
HERE ANYMORE?
OUR POLICY IS
CONTINUOUS ENTERTAINMENT.
KAY'S BEEN FINISHED
FOR 5 MINUTES.
WE'RE COMIN',
MASSAH SAM, WE'RE COMIN'.
COME ON, KIDS,
LET'S GET GOING.
YOU HAPPY,
JIGGER?
WE'RE IN
THE GROOVE AGAIN.
SURE, CHARACTER,
WE'RE IN THE GROOVE AGAIN.
HA HA HA.
IT'S A SCREAM,
IT'S A SCREAM.
WE'RE CLOSING
NOW, THAT'LL BE $2.75.
OK,
HERE'S MINE.
KEEP THE CHANGE, JOE.
KEEP THE CHANGE,
SHE SAYS...
SHE KILLS ME...
COME ON, NOW.
THE MAN SAYS HE'S CLOSING UP.
GOOD NIGHT,
HANDSOME!
GOOD NIGHT,
HON. SHE MEANS ME.
HA HA HA.
GOOD NIGHT,
BEAUTIFUL.
COME ON.
[SINGING]
HA HA HA.
[KA-CHING]
GAME STILL GOING
UPSTAIRS, SAM?
IT'S JUST ABOUT
BREAKIN' UP.
IS DEL UP THERE YET?
YEAH.
DID HE SAY ANYTHING
TO YOU ABOUT ME?
NO. WHY?
JUST ASKED.
WE'RE DOING ALL RIGHT
TONIGHT, AIN'T WE, SAM?
YOU MEAN, DEL
DID ALL RIGHT.
TOO BAD.
WHAT'S TOO BAD?
WE COULD
RUN THIS PLACE WITHOUT DEL.
WHAT'RE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
YOU COUNT THIS KIND
OF MONEY OUT,
AND YOU SAY
TO YOURSELF,
"IT COULD BE MINE--"
AND YOURS.
IT'S SO EASY, TOO.
A TELEPHONE
CALL. YOU'RE CRAZY.
YOU JUST SAY,
"THIS DEL DAVIS,
HE'S WANTED IN 'FRISCO."
THEY COME UP
IN A CAR IN 5 MINUTES.
THEY TAKE HIM AWAY.
IT COULD HAPPEN
LIKE THIS.
A TELEPHONE CALL.
SHUT UP.
REHEARSAL TOMORROW
AT 11:00, BOYS.
CAN'T WE HAVE
TOMORROW OFF? I'M TIRED.
GEE, I THOUGHT
THE BAR WAS CLOSED.
MY NAME IS KAY,
REMEMBER?
LOOKS LIKE EVERYTHING'S
ALL STRAIGHTENED OUT, HMM?
GOOD NIGHT, KAY.
JIGGER.
YEAH.
WHERE'S THAT SMILE
YOU PROMISED ME?
WE'RE STILL FRIENDS,
AIN'T WE?
LOOK, KAY,
THE BOYS ARE WAITIN' FOR ME.
A COUPLE OF HOURS
MAKES A DIFFERENCE, DON'T IT?
I AIN'T CHANGED,
AM I?
I STILL LOOK
THE SAME.
COME ON, JIGGER,
LET'S HAVE A DRINK.
JUST A LITTLE ONE.
Man:
LEAVE ME ALONE!
Del:
BRAD, COME BACK HERE!
NO! NO,
I WON'T COME BACK.
HOLD HIM THERE!
DON'T LET HIM GET AWAY!
[WHIMPERING]
DON'T LET HIM
HIT ME AGAIN.
I DIDN'T THINK
I'D LOSE, KAY.
DON'T LET HIM
HIT ME AGAIN, PLEASE, KAY.
TELL HIM, TELL HIM!
TELL HIM I WON'T DO IT AGAIN.
TELL HIM YOURSELF.
KAY, PLEASE,
PLEASE--DEL.
DEL, DON'T, PLEASE.
I TOLD YOU, TIME
AND TIME AGAIN,
TO KEEP AWAY FROM
THAT CRAP TABLE.
DEL, I DIDN'T
THINK I'D LOSE.
I HAD TO PAY OFF
FOR YOU-- 60 SMACKERS,
YOU DIRTY LITTLE--
DEL, I PROMISE
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.
LISTEN, DEL,
DON'T TAKE IT OUT ON THE POOR GUY.
HE DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S DOING MOST OF THE TIME.
LEAVE HIM ALONE.
GET OUT
OF THE WAY.
I SAID LEAVE
HIM ALONE! LISTEN!
IT'S A LUCKY THING
FOR YOU, JIGGER, I LIKE YOU.
DON'T LET HIM
HIT ME AGAIN, JIGGER.
HE WON'T
HIT YOU AGAIN.
ALL RIGHT, THIS ONCE,
NOW GO ON,
GET OUT OF HERE.
GET OUT OF HERE!
YOU--!
HEY, YOU.
THAT JERK
BELONGS TO YOU.
KEEP HIM
OUT OF MY WAY.
NOW, LISTEN, JIGGER,
YOU'RE MY FRIEND.
THAT'S WHY
I TELL YOU THIS,
DON'T MAKE
SUCH MISTAKES AGAIN.
JUST STICK
TO YOUR MUSIC,
KEEP OUT
OF MY BUSINESS.
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
BOYS, YOU'RE GOING ALREADY?
IT WAS A LITTLE ROUGH
UP THERE TONIGHT.
GETTIN' LATE,
DEL.
CAN'T BE LUCKY
ALL THE TIME, YOU KNOW.
IT'S THE WAY
I MAKE MY LIVING.
SO LONG.
HERE'S TO YOU,
JIGGER.
YOU DID ALL RIGHT.
HEY, JIGGER.
JIGGER,
WHERE'RE YOU GOING?
HOW ABOUT THAT DRINK?
JIGGER!
JIGGER.
YOU WEREN'T A-SCARED OF HIM.
WHAT ARE YOU
SCARED OF ME FOR?
JIGGER...
JIGGER!
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
SO NERVOUS ABOUT?
MY MOM HAD 5,
AND SHE TOLD ME
THAT EVERY ONE WAS
A CINCH--EXCEPT ME.
YOU CAN
COME IN NOW.
WELL,
WHERE IS SHE?
OH, SHE'LL
BE RIGHT OUT.
HERE SHE COMES.
BABY,
HOW DO YOU FEEL?
GOSH, I'VE BEEN
SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
SIT DOWN, CHARACTER,
YOU BETTER STAY OFF YOUR FEET.
YOU GOTTA
WATCH YOUR DIET, CHARACTER.
GET PLENTY
OF REST, BABY--
AND STAIRS--HOW
ABOUT GOING UP AND DOWN STAIRS?
WHICH ONE OF YOU
IS THE HUSBAND?
OH, DOC, HOW IS SHE?
HOW ARE YOU?
I'VE HEARD
OF QUINTUPLETS--
DOC, THIS IS
THE FATHER, RIGHT HERE...
NOW, DOC, YOU GOTTA
TELL ME, NO MATTER IF IT'S THE WORST.
SHE'S GOING
TO HAVE A BABY.
OH, YEAH,
THAT I KNOW.
SHE MUST TAKE
CARE OF HERSELF.
THE NURSE
OUTSIDE'LL
GIVE YOU A LIST
OF THINGS THAT SHE HAS TO DO,
AND, WHEN
THE TIME COMES,
THE BABY'LL
BE BORN.
THAT'S
ABOUT ALL.
OH, UH,
ONE MORE THING.
I WANT HER
TO STOP WORKING.
STOP WORKING?
OH, NOT RIGHT NOW.
IN ABOUT A MONTH OR SO.
BUT, DOCTOR,
SINGING ISN'T WORKING.
I'M AFRAID IT IS.
THERE'S A GREAT DEAL
OF STRAIN.
YOU HAVE TO KEEP
LATE HOURS.
BUT, LISTEN--
THAT'S JUST LIKE
ASKING ME TO STOP BREATHING.
OH, YOU DON'T
KNOW, DOC.
JIGGER, YOU
EXPLAIN IT TO HIM.
TELL HIM
WHAT IT MEANS FOR ME TO SING.
TELL HIM THE WAY
WE WORK TOGETHER,
THAT YOU CAN'T
DO WITHOUT ME.
WELL, THE FACT
IS WE CAN'T, CHARACTER...
I GUESS
WE'VE GOT TO.
TO TRAIN A GIRL
IN 4 WEEKS,
THAT'S A JOB,
FOR OUR KIND OF MUSIC.
YOU JUST CAN'T
STEP IN AND SING.
THERE'S A GIRL
I HEARD UP IN HARLEM THE OTHER NIGHT,
SHE'S GOT THE SAME
KIND OF BEAT THAT CHARACTER'S GOT.
NOBODY'S GOT
WHAT CHARACTER'S GOT.
YEAH, COME
TO THINK OF IT,
SHE'S NOT AS GOOD
AS CHARACTER.
WELL, I'LL GO
TO ANOTHER DOCTOR.
YOU'LL DO
WHAT HE SAYS.
HEY, MAYBE WE COULD
DO WITHOUT A SINGER,
TILL WE GET THIS BABY.
WE CAN'T DO
WITHOUT A SINGER.
THEY'LL MISS IT,
YOU DOPE.
WE WON'T HAVE TO DO
WITHOUT A SINGER. I'VE MADE UP MY MIND.
THE DOCTOR'S WRONG,
AND I'M GONNA WORK--
NO!
POSITIVELY, NO.
WAIT A MINUTE,
UNTIL WE FIND OUT WHAT JIGGER'S GOTTA SAY.
JIGGER, YOU HAVEN'T
SAID ANYTHING SO FAR.
WHADDA YA THINK?
HUH?
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT CHARACTER,
GETTING
ANOTHER SINGER, WHADDA YA SAY?
OH, I...
WELL, LOOK, FELLOWS, I GOT AN IDEA.
IDEA, HUH?
YEAH. MAYBE
IT'LL WORK OUT. WHAT IS IT?
WELL, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO JUMP DOWN MY THROAT WHEN I POP THIS.
I WANT YOU
TO LISTEN TO ME.
COME ON, COME ON,
GIVE OUT, WHAT IS IT?
YEAH, WHAT?
WELL,
IT'S LIKE THIS.
I'VE BEEN THINKING
A LOT ABOUT THIS,
AND I WANT YOU GUYS
TO THINK ABOUT IT, TOO.
COME ON,
BUDDHA, SPEAK.
WELL, HOW ABOUT--
HOW ABOUT PUTTING
KAY IN THE BAND?
ARE YOU KIDDING?
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
I KNOW SHE AIN'T PERFECT, BUT I CAN WORK WITH HER.
AFTER ALL,
WE GOT 4 WEEKS, CHARACTER'LL HELP.
WELL, THAT DOESN'T SEEM
LIKE SUCH A CRAZY IDEA.
WHY NOT?
I'LL GO OVER THE ARRANGEMENTS WITH HER.
I'M WILLING
TO HELP.
WELL, I THINK
SHE'S GOT TALENT.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
I SAY
SHE STINKS.
JIGGER,
YOU CAN'T MEAN THIS.
YEAH, JIGGER,
WHAT'S THE MATTER? WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
TO LOSE YOUR FEELING
FOR MUSIC,
TO MAKE YOURSELF
BELIEVE, JIGGER,
THAT SHE'S GOT EVEN
ONE DROP OF TALENT--
I'LL MAKE HER
HAVE TALENT,
I'LL WORK WITH HER.
SHE'S GONNA SPOIL
EVERYTHING,
EVERYTHING WE'VE
WORKED FOR-- LIVED FOR.
SHE WON'T
SPOIL ANYTHING.
WHY DON'T
YOU GUYS GIVE ME TIME
TO WORK IT OUT
WITH HER?
I KNOW SHE'LL
COME THROUGH.
OK, JIGGER.
THIS IS YOUR IDEA.
YES, THIS IS
MY IDEA--ALL RIGHT, I'LL SHOW YOU.
WHEN I GET THROUGH
WORKING WITH HER,
SHE'LL SING GOOD ENOUGH
FOR YOU GUYS OR ANYBODY ELSE.
I'LL SHOW YOU
HOW WRONG YOU ARE, AND HOW RIGHT I AM.
SOMEWHERE, SOME DAY--
NO, NO, NO.
CAN'T YOU HEAR THAT NOTE?
WE'LL BE CLOSE TOGETHER
WAIT AND SEE
OH, COME ON, KAY,
TAKE IT AGAIN, YOU STARTED LATE.
SOMEWHERE,
SOME DAY
WE'LL BE CLOSE TOGETHER
WAIT AND SEE
OH, BY THE WAY
Jigger: COME ON, KAY,
YOU AIN'T TOO TIRED.
THIS TIME
THE DREAM'S ON ME
NO, NO. HIT IT.
TAKE MY HAND
AND YOU LOOK AT ME ADORINGLY
COME ON, RIDE IT,
KAY, RIDE IT.
BUT AS THINGS
STAND
THIS TIME
THE DREAM'S ON ME
YOU CAN GET IT,
LISTEN, KID...
I WON'T.
YOU WILL. I CAN'T.
SING IT.
I CAN'T, I CAN'T,
I CAN'T--
[SCREAMING]
STOP IT,
STOP IT, STOP IT!
YOU CRAZY?
YEAH, FOR EVER
HAVING STARTED THIS.
I AM THROUGH.
ONCE AND FOR ALL, I'M THROUGH!
NOW, KAY, YOU'RE
TIRED, WE WENT TOO HARD TONIGHT.
WE'LL START AGAIN
IN THE MORNING.
YOU'LL START
IN THE MORNING WITHOUT ME!
LISTEN, KAY,
A FEW MORE WEEKS--
A FEW MORE WEEKS--
A FEW MORE HOURS, A FEW MORE DAYS,
I DON'T CARE
IF I NEVER SING ANOTHER NOTE
OF THIS SONG
OF YOURS!
I KNOW WHAT I WANT
AND THIS AIN'T IT.
NOW LISTEN, KAY,
YOU KNOW
WHY I DID THIS, DON'T YOU?
YEAH,
TO SHOW OFF IN FRONT OF THE OTHER GUYS.
A MAGICIAN, WHO CAN
MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF NOTHING.
LISTEN, I DID IT
FOR YOU, BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.
YOU LOVE ME--
THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER
WAYS YOU CAN SHOW ME HOW YOU LOVE ME.
KAY...
LISTEN, KAY.
IF YOU'LL ONLY HAVE A LITTLE PATIENCE,
THEY'LL CHANGE
THEIR MINDS, I KNOW THEY WILL.
WHADDA YA MEAN,
THEY--WHO ARE THEY?
THE BOYS. THE BAND.
THE BAND, I'M SICK
AND TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT THE BAND.
CAN'T YOU DO
SOMETHING
FOR YOURSELF,
ONCE IN A WHILE?
I TOLD YOU
HOW IT IS WITH US.
YEAH, YOU TOLD ME
HOW IT IS WITH YOU AND ME, TOO.
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
I DON'T BELIEVE
ANYTHING YOU SAY.
IF YOU MEANT IT,
YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE IN THIS JOINT,
HOLDING UP
THAT CRUMMY BAND.
YOU'D GET OUT
AND BE SOMEBODY.
YOU'D DO SOMETHING
FOR ME INSTEAD OF FOR THEM.
HERE,
HAVE A DRINK.
THANKS.
WONDER IF YOU'D
DO ME A FAVOR. SURE.
WOULD YOU MIND
PLAYING FOR ME?
FUNNY,
A GUY LIKE ME, HOW I GO FOR MUSIC.
AND YET
I CAN'T PLAY WELL.
BUT THEN, I NEVER
COULD DO ANYTHING VERY WELL,
EXCEPT HANG AROUND
AND WAIT.
[PLAYING PIANO]
WHEN I SEE YOU
PLAY THAT PIANO,
I SAY TO MYSELF,
"GOSH, I WISH
THAT WAS ME."
YOU'VE GOT
GREAT TALENT.
SHE'LL RUIN
THAT TALENT.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS?
I USUALLY DO.
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
THAT'S ONE
OF THE FEW THINGS I'M VERY GOOD AT.
LOOK, BRAD,
DON'T YOU THINK--
THAT NIGHT WITH DEL.
YOU HELPED ME.
I'D HAVE DONE
AS MUCH FOR ANYBODY.
NO, IT WAS
MORE THAN THAT.
YOU SORT OF
MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS SOMEBODY.
THAT'S KIND
OF A NEW FEELING FOR ME.
COULD YOU...
KEEP PLAYING?
[PLAYING PIANO]
FUNNY, A GUY
LIKE ME THAT'S NOT VERY IMPORTANT.
I NEVER STARTED
OUT WITH ANYTHING IN LIFE,
SO WHAT DID I
HAVE TO LOSE?
I USED TO HAVE
A RANCH--
YEAH, MY FATHER
LEFT IT TO ME.
NEVADA.
OH, IT WAS
NICE THERE.
FREE AND EASY LIFE.
YOU'D HAVE LIKED IT
THERE, JIGGER.
SPECIALLY AT NIGHT.
COWBOYS USED
TO MAKE UP SONGS ABOUT THEMSELVES,
ABOUT THEIR WORK--
REAL SONGS,
THE KIND OF SONGS
YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE PLAYED.
THAT WAS
THE BEGINNING OF MY MUSICAL CAREER.
STRUMMING A GUITAR
AND HOWLIN' AT THE MOON.
OH, GOSH,
IT WAS NICE.
I LOST THE PLACE,
SHORT TIME AFTER I MET HER.
SHE WAS PART
OF A TROUPE PLAYING
IN A ONE-NIGHT-STAND
COMPANY.
I TOOK HER OUT,
GUESS AT FIRST
I SORT OF FELT SORRY FOR HER.
THAT'S THE WAY
YOU FELT, TOO.
AND AFTER THAT,
IT GOT TO BE LIKE A DISEASE.
LOOK, BRAD,
IT'S GETTIN' LATE.
THIS FOOT--
I GOT THROWN OFF
A HORSE IN A RODEO. I WAS KIND OF DRUNK.
SHE'S THE KIND
THAT SORT OF MAKES YOU WANT
TO SHOW OFF
IN FRONT OF HER.
WELL, I DIDN'T HAVE
VERY MUCH CHANCE.
I WAS TOO FULL
OF LIQUOR.
AND I FELL,
GOT KICKED TWICE,
ONCE IN THE SPINE.
I WASN'T MUCH GOOD
FOR ANYTHING AFTER THAT, EXCEPT--
HANGING AROUND...
HER.
HAVE ANOTHER?
I GUESS IF IT
WASN'T FOR THIS HERE FOOT,
SHE WOULDN'T EVEN
LET ME DO THAT.
MAYBE SHE WOULD,
AT THAT.
NO, I HAVEN'T GOT
ANYTHING ANYMORE SHE WANTS.
I TELL YOU,
IT GIVES HER SORT OF A FEELING OF POWER.
IT GIVES HER
A CHANCE
TO HAVE SOMEONE
AROUND SHE CAN KICK.
IF I THOUGHT
SHE WAS REALLY IN LOVE WITH YOU,
I WOULDN'T HAVE
SAID A THING.
BUT SHE'S NOT,
AND I KNOW SHE'S NOT.
WHAT HAPPENS
TO YOU IS
REALLY IMPORTANT
NOW, JIGGER.
NOW, BEFORE
IT'S TOO LATE.
GET HER OUT
OF YOUR SYSTEM.
I DON'T THINK
I CAN, BRAD.
I JUST DON'T
THINK I CAN.
Dealer:
8 IS THE POINT.
[GAMBLERS SHOUTING]
SHE COMES TO 5!
[SHOUTING]
KAY RIDES AGAIN!
HERE WE GO.
WELL, WELL, WELL.
WHAT'D YOU DO, KAY--
GIVE UP
YOUR MUSIC LESSONS?
COME ON, BABY,
ROLL THE DICE, COME ON.
DON'T YOU KNOW I GOT
A RULE ANYBODY WORKS FOR THE HOUSE DON'T PLAY?
I'M PLAYING
ON MY OWN MONEY.
THE RULE STILL GOES.
GIVE HER
A BREAK, DEL.
I DON'T WANT
ANY BREAK. HERE'S YOUR DICE.
TAKE CARE
OF MY CHIPS FOR ME, CHARLIE.
YOU KNOW THE RULES
THEY GOT HERE.
NOW, THE NEXT TIME
THIS HAPPENS,
YOU CAN FIND YOURSELF
ANOTHER JOB.
KAY.
WHADDA YOU WANT?
GET WISE
TO YOURSELF.
I TOLD YOU BEFORE,
IT'S EASY-- A TELEPHONE CALL.
YOU TALK TO HIM,
I'LL GO DOWNSTAIRS ACROSS THE STREET.
IT SOUNDS SO EASY.
I GOTTA GO NOW.
BETTER MAKE
UP YOUR MIND QUICK.
BETTER GO DOWN
AND TELL SAM IT'S TIME TO CLOSE UP.
OK, DEL.
DEL?
HMM?
WHY SHOULD WE KEEP FIGHTING
EACH OTHER THIS WAY?
WE AIN'T FIGHTING,
BABY.
THERE'S NO CONTEST.
LISTEN, DEL, YOU KNOW
HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU.
YOU KNOW THERE
AIN'T NOBODY ELSE, NEVER WILL BE.
WHAT ABOUT YOUR
SINGING LESSONS?
HE DON'T MEAN
NOTHING TO ME.
I'D THROW HIM OVER
IN A MINUTE.
YOU WANT ME
TO TELL HIM THAT?
I DON'T CARE NOTHING
FOR HIM. IT'S YOU.
OOH, IT'S ME, HUH?
LISTEN, DEL,
WHY DO YOU THINK I STAY HERE SO LONG?
WHY DO YOU THINK I WENT
THROUGH ALL I DID?
WHY DO YOU THINK
I STARTED WITH THAT TRUMPET PLAYER WITH JIGGER?
I'M TELLING YOU, DEL.
YOU GOTTA BELIEVE ME.
DEL, FOR
THE FIRST TIME--
WHY DON'T YOU GET WISE
TO YOURSELF, KAY?
IT AIN'T ME.
I KNOW THAT.
I KNEW THAT 3 YEARS AGO.
YOU WOULDA WALKED ON ME
LIKE I WANNA WALK ON THE KID,
IF THERE'D BEEN ANYBODY
ELSE AROUND THAT LOOKED ANY BETTER TO YOU.
I BEAT YOU TO THE PUNCH,
THAT'S ALL.
YOU'RE JUST LIKE ME,
KAY.
YOU WANT WHAT
YOU CAN'T HAVE.
YEAH, YEAH, IT
USED TO BE LIKE THAT,
BUT IT AIN'T GONNA BE
LIKE THAT NO MORE.
DEL, IT'S GONNA BE
DIFFERENT. YOU'LL SEE.
BABY, IF I THOUGHT SO,
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE TALKING THIS WAY TO ME.
YOU MEAN
YOU'D TAKE ME BACK?
I MIGHT IF I THOUGHT
I COULD TRUST YOU.
YOU CAN, DEL,
YOU CAN.
I CAN PROVE IT TO YA.
I CAN PROVE IT TO YA.
AW, YOU'RE WASTING
YOUR TIME.
LOOK, DEL, ONLY
A COUPLE OF MINUTES AGO SAM COMES UP TO ME--
SAY, DEL,
HOW'S THIS CHECK?
IT'S OK.
WHAT WERE YOU
SAYING ABOUT SAM?
NOTHING. NOTHING.
GO ON. YOU STARTED.
FINISH.
ALL RIGHT, MAYBE
THIS'LL PROVE IT TO YOU.
A COUPLE OF MINUTES AGO
SAM COMES UP TO ME.
HE WANTED ME TO TURN YOU IN,
TO CALL UP THE COPS.
JUST A TELEPHONE CALL,
HE SAYS.
SAM WANTED YOU
TO DO THAT?
YEAH, IT AIN'T
THE FIRST TIME, EITHER.
HE'S ASKED ME
LOTS OF TIMES.
BUT I DIDN'T DO IT.
I ALWAYS TALKED HIM OUT OF IT.
I COULDA DONE IT,
BUT I DIDN'T DO IT.
YOU SEE, YOU
CAN TRUST ME, DEL.
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU
JUST DID FOR SAM, DON'T YOU?
YOU JUST PUT HIS
NUMBER ON THE BOARD.
LOOK, I--I DIDN'T
MEAN IT LIKE THAT.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
A BIT OF ADVICE, KAY.
GET OUT OF HERE AND
DON'T EVER COME BACK.
DO IT FAST, KAY.
DON'T HANG AROUND TOO LONG.
WHAT'S THE MATTER, DEL?
SOMETHING WRONG?
HERE.
WHAT'S THE NICKEL FOR?
FOR THE TELEPHONE
CALL.
YOU KNOW, SAM, YOU
DON'T LOOK SO GOOD.
YOU OUGHTA
TAKE A TRIP...
FOR YOUR HEALTH.
HEY, FELLAS!
HEY, FELLAS!
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
SAM'S GONE! YEAH,
GONE JUST LIKE THAT.
MIKE THE BARTENDER
JUST TOLD ME.
HE GOT SICK
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
BAD ATTACK OR SOMETHING.
THOSE TWO GUYS
WORK FOR DEL HAD TO TAKE HIM AWAY.
CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT?
A HEALTHY GUY LIKE SAM?
DEL SAYS WE MAY NEVER
SEE HIM AGAIN.
OK, OK, SO WE'LL
NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, OK?
A GUY DISAPPEARS
AND ALL HE SAYS IS OK.
HEY, PETE,
WHAT'S GOING ON UP HERE?
NOTHING. EVERYTHING'S
JUST ROSY POSIE.
JIGGER'S LEAVING,
PEPPI.
LEAVING?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
LEAVING?
WHAT'S SHE TALKING
ABOUT, JIGGER?
OPEN UP, WILL YA?
THE WORLD AS IT IS
NOW CONSTITUTED--
YEAH, WE KNOW.
IT STINKS.
FROM RAGS TO RICHES,
OUR HERO GOES TO THE BIG CITY
TO MAKE HIS FORTUNE,
TO LAY AT THE FEET OF HIS LADY FAIR,
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK?
SHE REWARDS HIM
BY KICKING HIM RIGHT SMACK IN THE TEETH!
SHUT UP, LEO.
OH, I GET IT.
WHEN I WANT TO WALK OUT,
I CAN BE TOLD OFF,
BUT HIM--HA. THE MAESTRO.
Peppi:
WHAT ABOUT US?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHAT ABOUT US?
DON'T YOU REMEMBER,
PEPPI?
THIS AIN'T NO BAND.
THIS IS A UNIT.
5 BOYS THAT PLAY, LIVE,
EVEN THINK THE SAME WAY.
YEAH, JIGGER,
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID.
ALL RIGHT,
SO HE SAID IT.
AND WHEN HE SAID IT,
HE MEANT IT.
GO AHEAD.
TELL HIM, JIGGER.
TELL HIM ABOUT
THE WONDERFUL JOB YOU GOT,
ABOUT THE REAL MUSIC
YOU'RE GONNA PLAY.
MONKEY ON A STICK.
MONKEY ON A STICK.
30 PIECE ORCHESTRA,
JIGGER IN A WHITE COAT WITH GOLD BRAIDS.
MOONLIGHT IN BERMUDA,
MOONLIGHT IN KANSAS CITY,
MOONLIGHT IN WEEHAWKEN.
WHEN I GET MY
SUMMER VACATION
YOU CAN BET
I'M GOING TO BE
FAR AWAY FROM
CIVILIZATION
IN WAIKIKI, WHOO!
AND THE LEADER
GOES TAP TAP,
AND JIGGER GETS UP.
THEN JIGGER SITS
RIGHT DOWN AGAIN.
COME ON, SMILE, JIGGER.
PLAY, JIGGER.
LOUDER, JIGGER.
SOFTER, JIGGER.
OH, YOU'LL
LOVE IT THERE.
HEY, JIGGER.
HE'S WAITING DOWNSTAIRS
IN THE CAR FOR YOU.
ARE YOU COMING,
JIGGER?
WELL, GOOD-BYE, FELLAS.
I GUESS I'LL BE SEEING YOU.
JIGGER!
YEAH, PEPPI?
NOTHING.
YOU LUGS!
YOU THICK-HEADED LUGS!
DO YOU THINK HE WANTED
TO WALK OUT ON US?
DON'T YOU THINK HE WAS
RIPPED UP ENOUGH INSIDE
WITHOUT YOU
TURNING THE KNIFE?
CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU CAN BE IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE,
KNOW THAT IT'S WRONG,
THAT IT'S POISON,
AND NOT BE ABLE TO DO
ANYTHING ABOUT IT?
OR HAVE YOU BLOWN OUT YOUR
BRAINS COMPLETELY BY NOW?
CHARACTER...
OH, LEAVE ME ALONE.
[CRYING]
GOOD EVENING,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THIS IS GUY HEISER
GREETING YOU
FROM THE BANDSTAND
OF THE BEAUTIFUL PALOMINE BALLROOM.
FOR OUR FIRST NUMBER,
WE PRESENT THAT SENSATIONAL NOVELTY TUNE
THAT'S BEEN SWEEPING
THE COUNTRY,
SAYS YOU, SAYS I,
STARRING THE MUSICAL NIGHTS,
THE FIVE HEISER HIGHLIGHTS,
THE FOUR TURBULENT TROMBONES,
VOCALS BY BABY BETH BARTON,
AND OF COURSE,
JIGGER PINE,
DISCOVERY OF THE YEAR,
AT THE PIANO.
[MUSIC STARTS]
HOW'S ABOUT
A LITTLE DANCE, BEAUTIFUL?
LATER.
I'M THIRSTY NOW.
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
BABY?
YOU WORRIED ABOUT
YOUR BOYFRIEND, THE PIANO PLAYER?
IS HE JEALOUS?
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT
ANYTHING OR ANYBODY.
I'LL DO WHAT I LIKE
AND DANCE WHEN I LIKE.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
BABE. DON'T GET EXCITED.
JUST SAY THE WORD.
THAT'S ALL YOU
GOTTA DO, BABY, IS SAY THE WORD.
WHERE DO WE GO
FROM HERE?
SHE'S NOT HAVING
ANY FUN HERE.
COME ON,
LET'S GO.
YOU GO AHEAD, LEO.
I CAN'T.
I'LL WAIT HERE
FOR YOU.
BUT, CHARACTER--
OK, BABY.
COME ON, GUYS.
I THOUGHT
YOU'D SHOW UP.
WHY'D YOU STAND OVER HERE
BY YOURSELF FOR, CHARACTER?
WHY DON'T YOU SIT
DOWN AT A TABLE?
I GOT A COUPLE
OF GUYS OVER THERE
BE TICKLED TO DEATH
TO BUY A PRETTY GIRL LIKE YOU A DRINK.
MAYBE THIS PLACE
AIN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU.
MAYBE YOU'D
RATHER BE BACK IN THE JUNGLE.
OR DID DEL
THROW YOU OUT?
OH, I GET IT.
YOU'VE COME TO ASK JIGGER FOR A JOB.
WE CAME HERE FOR
ONLY ONE REASON,
TO GET HIM BACK
WHERE HE BELONGS.
WHY DON'T YOU
TALK TO HIM?
SAY TO HIM,
"JIGGER, COME BACK.
"SHE AIN'T GOOD
ENOUGH FOR YOU.
YOU GOT
TOO MUCH TALENT. SHE'S BAD FOR YOU."
LOOK, KAY.
WHAT'S BETWEEN
YOU AND JIGGER'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS,
AND NEVER HAS BEEN,
AS LONG AS IT STAYS PUT THAT WAY.
BUT WHEN IT STARTS
TAKING A GUY THAT'S GOT WHAT HE'S GOT ON THE BALL,
TWISTING HIM AROUND TILL
HIS WHOLE LIFE IS MESSED UP--
WHAT ARE YOU SO
WORRIED ABOUT IT FOR?
WE'RE ALL
WORRIED ABOUT IT.
WAIT A MINUTE.
I AIN'T SO SURE.
I THINK YOU'RE
WORRIED ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.
I THINK
YOU'RE JEALOUS.
YOU'RE SAYING
TO YOURSELF
WHY AIN'T IT ME
INSTEAD OF HER?
I'D SLAP YOU RIGHT
IN THE MOUTH
IF I THOUGHT IT'D
DO YOU ANY GOOD.
YOU'RE SAYING TO
YOURSELF WHY AIN'T SHE BEGGING TO ME
LIKE I COME
TO BEG TO HER?
YOU'LL BEG.
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY
FOR YOU TO WIND UP
THAN TO BEG
AND CRAWL AND CRY
AND BEAT YOUR BRAINS OUT
AGAINST A WALL.
AND WHEN YOU
DO GET TO IT,
WHEN YOU GET TURNED DOWN,
YOU'LL BE ALONE. I'M NOT.
I'LL ALWAYS HAVE JIGGER.
AT LEAST SO LONG
AS I WANNA HAVE HIM.
NO, YOU WON'T.
HE'LL GET OVER YOU.
WHAT'S BETWEEN JIGGER
AND MYSELF AND THE BOYS
IS SOMETHING YOU
CAN NEVER GIVE HIM,
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
UNDERSTAND IT.
THAT'LL STAY WITH JIGGER.
YOU WON'T.
Man: SAY, BABY.
THE NIGHT'S
GETTING SHORTER.
I'LL BE WITH YOU
IN A SECOND.
GO GET MY COAT.
OK.
AND IF IT'LL MAKE
YOU HAPPY,
I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING ELSE.
MAYBE PRETTY SOON
YOU CAN HAVE HIM BACK...
THAT IS,

[MUSIC CONTINUES]
OH, UH...
YES, MISS GRANT?
WHAT TIME DID
MR. PINE COME IN?
THE USUAL TIME.
I SHOULD SAY ABOUT,
UM, 2:30.
DID HE ASK FOR ME?
JUST ASKED IF
YOU'D COME IN YET.
THANKS. GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT.
KAY.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
I'VE GOT
TO TALK TO YOU.
WHAT ABOUT?
WHO I WAS OUT WITH?
WHAT I WAS DOING?
WHY I GOT IN SO LATE?
YOU THINK I'M GOING
TO SIT AROUND THAT BALLROOM
LISTENING TO YOU PLAY
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT,
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND.
KAY, I QUIT
GUY HEISER'S BAND.
WHAT?
YEAH. TONIGHT.
AFTER THE SHOW.
I'D HAVE DONE IT
ANYWAY.
WELL, WHAT ABOUT IT?
KAY, I CAN'T GO ON
LIKE THIS.
WHEN I LEFT THE BOYS
AND ALL THAT MEANT TO ME,
I DID IT BECAUSE
I WAS IN LOVE WITH YOU.
'CAUSE I THOUGHT
WE COULD HAVE A LIFE TOGETHER.
I'M STILL
IN LOVE WITH YOU
AND I STILL WANT
TO MAKE A GO OF IT,
BUT THIS AIN'T IT,
KAY.
I KNOW IT AIN'T.
WELL, WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO ABOUT IT?
KAY...
WHY CAN'T WE GO BACK?
I PROMISE YOU THE
BOYS'LL SEE IT MY WAY.
I KNOW THEY WILL.
ARE YOU CRAZY?
IT DOESN'T HAVE
TO BE THE JUNGLE.
IT COULD BE
SOMEWHERE ELSE.
WHERE?
RIDING THE BOX CARS?
SO YOU QUIT GUY HEISER.
WELL, MAYBE
IT'S JUST AS WELL.
WHY?
YEAH, I THINK YOU
DID THE RIGHT THING.
I THINK YOU OUGHTA
GO BACK TO YOUR BAND.
THAT'S WHERE YOU BELONG,
NOT WITH ME.
KAY!
YOU HELPED ME
OUT OF A TOUGH SPOT.
I WAS KINDA WORRIED
ABOUT TELLING YOU.
TELLING ME WHAT?
THAT I'M LEAVING YOU,
JIGGER.
KAY.
YOU CAN'T MEAN THAT.
YOU'RE JUST SORE
BECAUSE I QUIT.
YOU JUST CAN'T
LEAVE LIKE THAT.
DON'T YOU REMEMBER
JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO
JUST BEFORE WE LEFT
THE JUNGLE--
THE ONLY THINK
I REMEMBER
ABOUT THE JUNGLE
IS DEL DAVIS.
THAT'S ALL I
WANT TO REMEMBER.
DEL DAVIS?
YOU DIDN'T THINK I WAS
IN LOVE WITH YOU, DID YOU?
IF HE'D TAKE ME BACK,
I'D CRAWL ON MY HANDS
AND KNEES TO HIM.
DEL DAVIS.
EVERY TIME YOU TOOK ME
IN YOUR ARMS,
I'D LOOK OVER YOUR SHOULDER
AND SEE IF DEL WAS AROUND.
SHUT UP.
TO SEE IF DEL WAS JEALOUS.
TO SEE IF DEL CARED ENOUGH
TO CUT OUT YOUR HEART
AND TAKE ME BACK.
I USED TO LAUGH AT YOU.
HA HA HA!
KAY, STOP IT.
YOU WERE GONNA MAKE
A BIG SINGER OUT OF ME!
YOU WOULD'VE HAD
THE WORLD AT MY FEET!
STOP IT, I SAID.
YOU DIDN'T REALIZE
I WAS PLAYING YOU FOR A CHUMP.
LIKE I PLAYED LEO.
LIKE I'LL PLAY ANYBODY
TO GET BACK TO HIM.
YOU!
YOU HEAR ME?
NOTHING'S GOING TO STOP ME.
WHEN I WANT SOMETHING,
NOTHING'S GONNA STOP ME!
IT'LL ALL BE MINE AGAIN!
DEL DAVIS, THE JUNGLE, ALL OF IT!
MINE! YEAH! MINE!
HELLO, CY.
OH, THERE
YOU ARE, JACK.
TAKE 'EM ALL
TO THE TABLES.
HEY, BILL.
YEAH?
I KNOW I'M INTO YOU
FOR A COUPLE OF BUCKS--
WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT?
A SHORT ONE.
JUST A SHORT ONE. PLEASE, BILL.
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE
I TOLD YOU YOUR CREDIT'S NO GOOD HERE ANYMORE?
LOOK, BILL,
I GOT A FEW LEADS.
I PROMISE YOU
I'LL HAVE SOME DOUGH SOON.
IN A WEEK OR TWO
I'LL BE ABLE TO CONNECT WITH A BAND,
A BIG NAME BAND.
ALL RIGHT, JIGGER.
ALL RIGHT.
JUST TO SHOW YOU MY HEART'S
IN THE RIGHT PLACE.
GEE, THANKS, BILL.
JIGGER.
PEPPI.
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.
LET ME LOOK
AT YOU, BOYS.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
HOW DO YOU FEEL?
JUST TO SEE YOU AGAIN
MAKES ME FEEL
A LOT BETTER.
THAT'S RIGHT,
JIGGER.
AS LONG AS
WE'RE HERE,
HOW ABOUT GETTING
A BITE TO EAT?
YEAH, SURE,
I'M HUNGRY.
THE FOOD'S AWFULLY
GOOD HERE, JIGGER.
SIT DOWN, WILL YA?
WE EAT HERE ALL THE TIME.
HEY, BILL, HOW
ABOUT SOME SERVICE?
YOU KNOW, JIGGER,
I GOT A NEW HORN.
WAIT TILL
YOU HEAR IT.
THE OLD ONE COULDN'T
STAND THE PRESSURE.
SAME OLD LEO,
ISN'T IT, JIGGER?
FULL OF BRAGGADOCIO.
MMM, THAT WAS SWELL.
WELL, YOU SEE,
I'VE BEEN AWAY.
OH, YOU DIDN'T MISS
ANYTHING MUCH.
WELL, WHEN I LEFT
THE JUNGLE--
YOU KNOW, WE WENT
UP TO HARLEM THE OTHER NIGHT.
HAD A JAM SESSION
UP THERE, RIGHT OUT OF THIS WORLD.
YEAH, YOU SHOULD'VE
BEEN THERE.
WE RUN 'EM CLEAR
OUT OF THE HALL.
LEO'S HOT LICKS HAD 'EM
TURNING ON FIRE ALARMS.
OH, GREAT GOING.
GREAT GOING.
HOW'S YOUR MOTHER,
NICKY?
OH, SHE'S STILL
SHOPPING AROUND FOR DOCTORS.
SHE'S GOT
A NEW ONE NOW, A NERVE SPECIALIST.
THANKS, PETE.
AND HOW'S CHARACTER?
SHE'S OK.
AND THE BABY.
I ALMOST FORGOT THE BABY.
SHE HAD THE BABY,
DIDN'T SHE?
YEAH, SHE HAD
THE BABY ALL RIGHT.
OH, THAT'S SWELL.
WHAT IS IT, A BOY OR A GIRL?
BOY.
WHAT'S HIS NAME?
WE CALL HIM JIGGER.
YOU KNOW WHAT,
JIGGER?
IT'D BE KIND OF NICE
IF YOU SHOWED UP
AT THE JUNGLE
ONE OF THESE NIGHTS,
RUN THROUGH
A COUPLE OF NUMBERS,
SEE IF WE'RE STILL
IN THE GROOVE.
GEE, I...I AIN'T
BEEN PLAYING VERY MUCH LATELY.
I'VE BEEN COMPOSING.
YEAH, WRITING TUNES.
I BEEN...
WORKING ON OUR BLUES,
TRYING TO BUILD IT UP,
MAKE SOMETHING BIGGER.
GEE, I'LL BET
IT'S GOOD.
LOOK, WHY DON'T
YOU PLAY IT FOR US?
WELL, YOU SEE, FELLAS,
IT AIN'T READY YET.
COME ON, JUST A PART
OF IT, JIGGER.
WE HAVEN'T HEARD
YOU PLAY ANYTHING IN AN AWFUL LONG TIME.
[EVERYONE TALKING
AT ONCE]
GUY PLAYS IT AT NIGHT.
BOY, JIGGER, EVERYTHING'S
GOING TO BE ROSY POSIE
WHEN YOU START HITTING
THOSE IVORIES AGAIN.
WELL, YOU SEE, IT BEGINS
WITH OUR OLD BLUES THEME.
WHAT COMES AFTER THAT?
YOU DIDN'T FORGET,
DID YOU?
NO, I DIDN'T FORGET.
WHISTLE IT FOR ME,
WILL YOU, PEPPI?
[WHISTLING]
YEAH, I'VE GOT IT.
[PLAYING PIANO]
WHAT COMES NEXT?
JIGGER!
WHAT COMES NEXT?
DON'T YOU THINK
MAYBE YOU'D BETTER--
NO, NO, DON'T TELL ME.
I'LL GET IT.
IT GOES...
GEE...
I CAN HEAR IT UP HERE,
BUT IT...
IT WON'T COME OUT
MY FINGERS.
IT'S ALWAYS LIKE THAT.
I KEEP REACHING OUT
TO GRAB IT...
IT WON'T STAND STILL.
SOMETHING KEEPS GETTING
IN FRONT OF IT.
YOU KNOW...
I REACH OUT TO GRAB IT,
AND IT JUST
WON'T STAND STILL.
MAYBE I'LL TRY IT AGAIN.
[NO AUDIO]
I CAN'T REMEMBER.
Peppi: JIGGER!
[NO AUDIO]
[YELLING INDISTINCTLY]
FIVE FINGERS IN A GLOVE!
NICE AND QUICK!
A DEGREE IN MUSIC!
KID'S GOT THE MISERY!
[LAUGHTER]
HEY...
MONKEY ON A STICK!
MONKEY ON A STICK!
[WOMAN, WHISPERING]
You're still in love with your piano.
Don't listen to him,
Jigger.
The Jungle, Jigger.
Remember the Jungle.
Remember the places we've been.
[PIANO PLAYING]
OH, JIGGER.
THAT WAS SWELL.
THAT WAS WONDERFUL!
DID YOU LIKE IT,
CHARACTER?
DID I LIKE IT?
THAT'S EVERYTHING
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT.
SO YOU LIVIN'?
YEAH!
WANT MORE?
YEAH!
COME BACK TOMORROW
AND YOU'LL GET IT.
OH, LET'S PLAY FOR THEM.
THEY WANT TO DANCE.
NO, NO, NO.
THAT'S ENOUGH FOR TONIGHT, JIGGER.
YEAH, YOU BETTER
TAKE IT EASY, JIGGER.
REMEMBER, YOU ONLY
BEEN OUT OF BED 4 DAYS.
IT'S MEDICINE TO ME.
MY OWN PRESCRIPTION. LET'S HIT IT!
[PLAYING PIANO]
HEY, CHARACTER?
I GUESS YOU WERE RIGHT.
I AM A LITTLE TIRED.
WILL YOU TAKE
THIS NUMBER FOR ME?
I'LL BE BACK
IN A LITTLE WHILE.
SURE.
SAY, DID ANYBODY SEE...
WHO YOU LOOKING FOR?
NO. NOTHING.
NOBODY.
HELLO, JIGGER.
I HEARD YOU WERE SICK,
BUT YOU LOOK ALL RIGHT.
YOU MUST BE HAPPY NOW,
EH, JIGGER?
BACK WITH YOUR BAND.
KAY, WHAT DO YOU WANT?
NOTHING.
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I WANT SOMETHING?
[THUNDER]
GOT A CIGARETTE,
JIGGER?
STILL BACK IN
THE SAME ROOM, HUH?
YOU'D THINK BY THIS TIME,
DEL WOULD MOVE YOU TO THE OTHER HOUSE.
KAY, WHY'D YOU
COME BACK?
WELL, JUST TO LOOK AROUND,
GET A FEW LAUGHS.
SEE IF THE PLACE
STILL LOOKS THE SAME.
LISTEN, KAY.
FOR 3 MONTHS I WAS
IN THE HOSPITAL.
DOC SAID I WAS
OUT OF MY MIND.
ONLY ONE THING KEPT
COMING CLEAR TO ME ALL THAT TIME.
SOMETHING INSIDE ME
KEPT SAYING
DON'T LET HER DO IT
AGAIN, JIGGER.
DON'T LET HER.
[DOOR BANGING]
OVER HERE.
ALL RIGHT, BRAD,
YOU SCRAM.
DON'T YOU THINK I OUGHTA
GO UP WITH YOU, DEL?
NO. I'LL HANDLE
IT MYSELF.
HELLO, DEL.
HELLO, KID.
FRED SAID YOU WALKED OUT
IN THE MIDDLE OF A NUMBER.
IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG?
NO, THERE'S
NOTHING WRONG.
JUST A LITTLE TIRED,
THAT'S ALL.
OH, I SEE.
SAY...
[THUNDER]
ANYBODY UP HERE
WITH YOU?
NO. THERE'S NOBODY
UP HERE. WHY?
I JUST THOUGHT I HEARD
SOMEBODY TALKING TO YOU, THAT'S ALL.
GUESS I WAS WRONG.
SORRY, KID.
HEY, DEL.
YEAH?
IT'S NOTHING,
BUT WOULD YOU MIND
TELLING THE FELLAS
IN THE BAND I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE?
SURE. SURE.
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.
THIS WEATHER AIN'T
TOO GOOD FOR YOU AFTER WHAT YOU BEEN THROUGH.
THANKS, DEL.
DEL!
YOU KNOW, I KINDA
FIGURED IT WAS YOU.
I GOTTA TALK TO YOU,
DEL.
DIDN'T I TELL YOU TO
KEEP AWAY FROM HERE?
TO KEEP AWAY
FROM THOSE KIDS?
LISTEN,
I GOTTA SEE YOU.
YOU HAD TO SEE ME?
WHY DO YOU GO
SNEAKING AROUND BACK DOORS?
WHY DIDN'T YOU COME
STRAIGHT TO ME?
OH, I WAS SCARED.
ALL RIGHT. SKIP IT.
HOW MUCH
DO YOU NEED?
I DON'T NEED NO MONEY.
COME ON, KAY,
DON'T PUT ON AN ACT WITH ME.
IT'S WRITTEN
ALL OVER YOU.
THE CLOTHES YOU WEAR,
THE LOOK IN YOUR EYES.
DEL, GIVE ME A BREAK.
I'M GIVING YOU A BREAK.
HOW MUCH DO YOU NEED?
I TOLD YOU I DON'T WANT
NO MONEY.
LOOK, TAKE THIS DOUGH
AND GET OUT OF HERE.
COME ON, KAY,
YOU'RE A SMART DAME.
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE SCORE IS.
A LITTLE REST, A LITTLE
DOUGH IN THE KITTY,
AND YOU'LL FEEL BETTER.
SURE.
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FIND
SOME GUY THAT DON'T KNOW YOU TOO WELL
THAT YOU CAN STILL
SELL A BILL OF GOODS TO.
HERE, I'M ALWAYS GLAD TO
HELP OUT AN OLD FRIEND.
DEL, DEL, YOU CAN'T GO.
YOU CAN'T!
OH, SHUT UP.
I HATE YOU.
I HATE THE SIGHT OF YOU.
WELL,
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.
THAT'S MORE LIKE
THE OLD KAY.
YOU AIN'T GONNA
GET RID OF ME SO EASY.
YOU AIN'T GONNA
KICK ME AROUND!
YOU THINK YOU'RE
A SMART GUY, HUH?
I'LL SHOW YOU!
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT
A SMALL-TIME GAMBLER, A NOBODY!
YEAH, YOU'LL BE
BEGGING TO ME.
BEGGING TO ME!
BEGGING FROM JAIL BARS!
I'LL SHOW YOU!
I SHOULD'VE DONE IT LONG AGO,
WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU!
YOU THOUGHT I
WAS CRAZY ABOUT YOU,
THAT YOU COULD DO
WHAT YOU LIKE WITH ME.
I'LL SHOW YOU
WHAT YOU CAN DO!
DEL. DEL...
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
I WAS SAYING, DEL.
DON'T.
DON'T. DEL!
DON'T!
DEL! DON'T!
PLEASE!
AAH!
PLEASE, DEL, PLEASE,
I'LL DO ANYTHING!
ANYTHING!
ANYTHING YOU WANT!
DEL, ARE YOU CRAZY?
STOP IT!
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
JIGGER! JIGGER,
HE WON'T LET ME OUT OF HERE!
HE WON'T LET ME
OUT OF HERE, PLEASE!
ALL RIGHT, JIGGER.
GO ON, GET OUT OF HERE.
PLEASE, HE'S GOING
TO KILL ME, JIGGER.
DON'T LET HIM
KILL ME!
I TOLD YOU ONCE BEFORE,
JIGGER.
DON'T BUTT IN
TO MY BUSINESS!
PLEASE, JIGGER!
IT'S ALL RIGHT, KAY.
HE WON'T HURT YOU.
I'M WARNING YOU, JIGGER.
ARE YOU CRAZY?
DROP THAT GUN.
GO ON,
GET OUT OF HERE!
AAH!
COME ON, NOW. COME ON.
HAND OVER THAT--
[GUNSHOT]
KAY, YOU BETTER GO.
GO AROUND BY THE BACK
OF THE HOUSE SO NOBODY WILL SEE YOU.
DEL'S CAR'S OUT FRONT.
I'LL BE THERE IN A MINUTE.
WHAT?
DON'T STAND THERE.
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.
JIGGER--
DO AS I SAY.
Woman: YOU BETTER CALL
A SERVICE STATION.
IT'S ONLY
ABOUT A MILE BACK.
Man: MAYBE SOMEBODY
IN HERE CAN HELP US.
YOU WOULD GET STUCK
ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS.
WELL, DEAR, IT
ISN'T MY FAULT THIS HAD TO HAPPEN.
Woman #2: OH, YOU GUYS,
LET'S GO IN.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
JIGGER,
WHAT HAPPENED?
YEAH, WE WERE
WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
NOTHING.
NOTHING.
YES, IT'S SOMETHING.
I CAN SEE BY YOUR FACE.
IT'S NOTHING,
I TELL YOU.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
I'LL BE BACK.
WHEN?
WILL YOU LET ME OUT OF HERE?
SHE CAME BACK,
DIDN'T SHE?
WILL YOU LET ME OUT OF HERE?
DIDN'T SHE?
LOOK, I'LL PROMISE
I'LL BE BACK IN A FEW DAYS, MAYBE A WEEK.
NO, THIS TIME
IT'S FOR GOOD.
LET ME GET THROUGH!
FOR 3 MONTHS WE SAT
AROUND YOUR BED, JIGGER.
YOU ALMOST DIED.
PETE, LET ME GO.
JIGGER, PLEASE DON'T
MAKE ME HIT YOU.
WE'VE HAD ENOUGH
TROUBLE, JIGGER.
WELL, GO AHEAD.
TELL HIM, CHARACTER. TELL HIM!
NO, LEO.
OK, THEN I'LL TELL HIM.
MY KID DIED.
KID--
YEAH, WE LIED TO YOU.
THE KID WAS BORN DEAD.
WE DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE
IT TOUGHER FOR YOU.
STOP, LEO.
NO, LET HIM HAVE IT.
MAYBE IT'LL DRIVE SOME SENSE INTO HIS HEAD.
THE CHANCES OF HER HAVING
THAT KID WERE 100 TO 1.
BUT SHE KEPT
THINKING ABOUT YOU.
WONDERING WHAT
WAS HAPPENING TO YOU.
WHAT'S THE USE
OF TALKING TO HIM?
HE'S BECOME
LIKE BRAD.
YEAH, LIKE BRAD.
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE.
AND THAT'S HOW
YOU'LL END UP.
A NOBODY. A NOTHING.
PLAYING IN JOINTS
LIKE YOU USED TO.
LIVING OFF WHAT
PEOPLE GIVE YOU.
THE KIND OF MUSIC
YOU PLAYED TONIGHT,
THE WAY YOU PLAYED IT,
YOU'RE THROWING ALL THAT AWAY
AND YOU'LL NEVER
GET IT BACK, JIGGER.
BECAUSE YOU'LL BE
A CRIPPLE LIKE BRAD.
ONLY WORSE, BECAUSE
YOU'LL BE CRIPPLED INSIDE OF YOU.
WELL, IT'S ALL RIGHT
FOR BRAD, JIGGER.
HE'S GOTTA LIVE
THAT WAY.
THAT'S THE WAY
HE'S GOTTA END UP.
BUT NOT YOU, JIGGER.
NOT YOU.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
JIGGER WILL SEE
YOU LATER.
HE TOLD ME TO DRIVE
YOU TO NYACK.
WHERE IS JIGGER?
WHY DOESN'T HE COME?
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
I'M GOING TO WAIT HERE UNTIL JIGGER COMES.
SHUT UP.
SURE YOU GOT IT STRAIGHT
WHEN JIGGER SAID TO MEET HIM AT NYACK?
DON'T WORRY, KAY.
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I'M DOING.
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?
YOU ALMOST WENT
OVER THE CLIFF!
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY, KAY.
WHAT IF WE DID?
I'D STILL BE SAVING
YOU FROM THE POLICE.
POLICE GOT YOU,
WHY, YOU'RE LIABLE TO SPEND
THE REST OF YOUR
LIFE IN PRISON.
THAT WOULD BE WORSE.
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
THIS WAY
WE'LL BE TOGETHER.
BRAD, SLOW DOWN!
IT'S REALLY
AN ACT OF LOVE, KAY.
SO JIGGER'LL
BE ABLE TO GET ALONG WITHOUT YOU.
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
HE'LL EVER BE ABLE
TO GET ALONG.
BUT ME. I WON'T.
STOP THE CAR!
NOTHING LEFT FOR ME TO
DO BUT CRAWL AFTER THIS.
LET ME OUT OF HERE!
LET ME OUT OF HERE!
LOOK! THERE'S SOMEONE
IN THE ROAD UP AHEAD.
I DON'T SEE ANYONE.
I DO. SAM AND DEL.
SAM AND DEL?
YOU'RE CRAZY!
NO, I'M NOT.
DON'T YOU SEE THEM?
RIGHT AROUND THE
BEND IN THE ROAD.
THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF.
THEY'RE WAITING FOR US.
THEY'RE TRYING
TO THUMB A RIDE.
BRAD!
WHAT DO YOU SAY, KAY?
LET'S GIVE 'EM A LIFT!
AAH!
[BELL DINGING]
[HORN PLAYING]
[BAND PLAYING]
OH, I HAD AN IDEA
IT WAS YOU.
STILL RIDING THE
BOX CARS, HEY BOYS?
HOW ARE YOU DOING,
FELLA? WHAT'S UP?
SAY, WE HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
SINCE THE LAST TIME
WE WENT THROUGH HERE
ABOUT A YEAR AGO.
ARE YOU GONNA
THROW US OFF?
NO, NOT YOU.
I GOT YOU ON
MY PREFERRED LIST OF PASSENGERS.
YOU CAN RIDE
THROUGH ANYTIME.
HOW YOU BEEN DOING?
OH, WE'VE BEEN
DOING OK.
SURE.
WE'RE RIGHT IN THE GROOVE.

All our advertising has been about the carnival for the last three years.
Now let's change that slogan for something different.
How about this?
Uh, " Mardi Gracias to you. "
- Mr. McCracken-
- Repeat that, Enrique.
The office is full of people screaming at me.
- Mr. McCracken, the Queen is on the rocks.
- Yeah!
What? What rocks? Where?
- On a reef off the tip of Florida somewhere. I just got word.
- Is it bad?
Well, it's inconvenient, but I don't think there's any danger. They're only 200 yards offshore.
Well, what was the captain doing in there with a whole ocean to play around in?
Well, go ahead with that copy, but take out the line about skirting the Florida coast.
Adios, Enrique.
I'll be in Williams's office.
- Hello, Dad. Doesn'tJay look wonderful?
- Wonderful.
I've just got word that the Cuban Queen is piled up on a reef down in Florida.
- How'd that happen? A storm?
- No!
I just checked on it.
It was the clearest night in years.
There weren't any casualties, but there could be plenty of lawsuits... and you've got to get down there and take care of things.
Oh, no, he doesn't.
Jay doesn't leave this town.
Have you forgotten we're being married Saturday?
- I had, but it doesn't make any difference.
- Oh, doesn't it?
No! That ship's worth five million.
Your wedding's only costing 3,000.
You'd better call up and charter a plane.
Excuse me. Miss Sullivan, call Eastern Airways and ask them-
Jay, turn that thing off.
This is ridiculous.
What makes you think you have to go with this building full of people?
- Send somebody else.
- Send somebody else?
Don't you realize what it could cost us in damage suits... if this isn't handled diplomatically?
You remember the Calypso Queen?
Just a little accident- nobody hurt.
We neglected to get waivers from four or five passengers, and what happened?
We got sued for $500,000.
Whenever there's any kind of an accident...
I always say, remember the Calypso.
Dad, if you mess up my wedding,
I'll never forgive you.
Look, you can get married anytime... but there's only one time to get 480 passengers off a reef...
- and that's as soon as possible.
- [ Intercom Buzzing ]
[ Miss Sullivan On Intercom ]
Eastern Airways.
- Tell them you don't want them.
- We do want them!
I want a plane ready to leave for Florida in 40 minutes.
- He's not going, I tell you.
- Oh, yes, he is going, and I'm- I'm sorry.
Well, what are you doing on the floor anyway?
Dad, now I mean this.
You haven't the faintest idea how important this is to me.
Now keep your shirt on, Terry.
He'll be down there this afternoon and back tomorrow night at the latest.
You know, something strikes me.
I never realized Jay was so indispensable around here.
If he's this important, he ought to have more money.
You young pirate. He's getting more than the other two vice presidents right now.
Well, he's worth more, or you'd be sending the other two.
All right. All right.
He'll get more.
If I'd known I was gonna have a gun stuck in my face...
I wouldn't have gone so heavy on that wedding present.
Now that I've ransomed you,Jay, do you mind getting ready and getting out of here?
- [Jay ] Right away.
- [ Grumbling ]
Now when you switch reservations, you have to go through a little red tape.
Will you sign this, please?
It's just a form that says the company wasn't to blame for the accident.
You'll like the Caribbean Queen.
She's a newer boat.
- Oh, thank you very much.
- Thank you.
- That'll be all. Thanks again.
- Thank you.
- Well, I guess that's about it.
- There's one more-
Miss Nan Spencer in E-76.
- We notified her.
- Apparently she's bashful.
E-76. Is that above or below the keel?
- Ah, hello.
- Miss Spencer?
- Yes?
- My name is Williams, and-
Oh, I'm glad to know you, Mr. Williams.
Are you Mr. Garvey's friend?
- Garvey?
- Yes. I was dancing with Mr. Garvey last night... and he mentioned a friend he'd like me to meet.
- Well, no, I'm afraid I'm not the one.
- Oh, it doesn't matter anyway.
I like the way nobody stands on ceremony on shipboard.
I met dozens of people last night.
Uh, would you like to come in?
- No, thanks. I only have a minute.
- Oh.
Miss Spencer, I represent the steamship company... and before we refund your passage money, we'd like your signature on this waiver.
Oh, you would?
Well, what about my vacation?
What happens to me?
Well, after all, Miss Spencer, it couldn't be helped.
- It- It was no one's fault.
- It was too somebody's fault.
- It was? Whose?
- The captain's.
If he'd been up on the bridge where he belonged instead of where he was... there never would have been any accident.
Uh, if you don't mind,
I- I think I will come in.
Hmm.
This is what your brochure calls spacious quarters.
Sit down if you can find a place.
Miss Spencer, about the captain,
I don't think I quite understood what you meant.
Well, last night I was up on deck with a gentleman... and when we hit the reef, there was a lot of excitement... and people started running out of their cabins.
The captain didn't come out of his.
If he'd been tending to his job instead of-
Well, we wouldn't be perched up on this sandbar right now.
- Now really, Miss Spencer, I-
- And just because of that, my vacation is ruined.
And I don't intend to let him get away with it either!
Your vacation isn't going to be ruined,
Miss Spencer.
If you'll let us have your signature on this waiver...
we'll exchange your tickets at no extra cost for passage on the Caribbean Queen... which leaves in two weeks.
Two weeks?
But I only have two weeks' vacation.
In two weeks,
I'll be back in Macy's selling hosiery.
Oh, that's too bad. That does eliminate your going on the Caribbean Queen.
Well, I'm afraid all we can do is try to make it up to you with a small check.
A check won't make it up.
I've saved for years. I've gone without lunches just so I could have this cruise.
I've planned on it. I- I've worn old dresses so I could have lovely clothes for it.
Do you think you can pay me back for all the fun I'm not gonna have with a check?
Aren't you being a little difficult?
Well, why not?
I'm being cheated out of my trip.
I- I tell you what we'll do,
Miss Spencer.
We want you to have your trip just as much as you want it.
Suppose we send you on to Havana by plane... pay all your expenses and give you a good time.
Wouldn't that be fair?
- When would I leave?
- Right away.
Well, I- I suppose that is pretty fair.
Well, I'm- I'm glad that's settled.
Now may I have your signature on this form, please?
You seem pretty anxious to get it.
Well, I haven't much time.
I'm due back in New York.
Well, I'm not signing anything until after I've had that trip.
But I've told you what we'll do for you.
Well, how do I know
I'll have a good time?
Well, that we can't guarantee.
All we can do is expose you to having a good time.
Well, I only hope I have as much fun as your brochure said I'd have.
Well, I'll- I'll make the arrangements,
Miss Spencer.
Uh, I'll contact you later.
That's all I hope.
But you don't understand,
Mr. McCracken.
She won't sign until after she's had the vacation... and she won't sign it then if she hasn't had a good time.
She can't get that high-handed with us!
Oh, yes, she can. There's something she knows about the ship's going aground... that I can't repeat over the air.
There is?
You mean she could sue us?
- Remember the Calypso.
- All right. All right.
Give her anything she wants within reason.
Or it might even be a little unreasonable, just so she signs that waiver.
But don't you leave her side until you get that signature.
But that'll take two weeks!
Have you forgotten about my wedding?
You can get married anytime.
Now keep in close touch with me. Bye.
Good-bye.

How would you
Like to spend a weekend in Havana

I'll see you down at SloppyJoe's
So long, boy and ship ahoy, Havana
Havana
Havana
Why, it's so gorgeous.
Well, there is no better suite in the hotel, and there is no better hotel in the city.
Seńorita.
There is no better view in the whole country.
- Oh, I knew it would be romantic.
- Romantic?
Seńorita, there is no place on this earth it is so romantic.
It's a wonder the population isn't bigger.
Oh, they come and go, but the reaction is always the same.
Here we have more alignments of the heart than any other place in the world.
And there have been more marriages in this hotel... than any other hotel in the world.
- Really?
- But absolutely.
And this is only what you call a fractional part of the romances.
- Well, uh, what are the best nightclubs here?
- Best nightclubs?
Oh, the Sans Souci, the Club Corazón, the Midi-
Midi's of course very popular with tourists.
But personally I prefer best the Casino Madrileńo. Oh.
Of course I've never been there. My information is only what I adhere to accidentally... but I have noticed that the people in the hotel who go there...
- come back latest and sleep longest-
- Ah. and tip hardest.
Oh- Oh, I'm so sorry.
I forgot all about it.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
Seńorita, you will not notice the slightest difference in the service.
Oh, thank you.
- Oh, hello there.
- Hello.
- Won't you come in?
- Thanks.
- Is everything all right?
- Oh, it's gorgeous. Couldn't be better.
- Just look at the view.
- Oh, nice, isn't it? I have the same view from my window.
And the bedroom!
- How do you like it?
- Very nice.
Even our furniture display on the ninth floor was never like this.
It's the, uh, presidential suite, you know.
Well, the whole cabinet could use the bathtub.
[ Sighs ]
They ought to have lifeguards.
During the off-season, they undoubtedly use it as a dry dock.
- Simply gorgeous.
- I'm glad you're pleased, Miss Spencer.
Oh, I am. It just couldn't be nicer.
Then perhaps you wouldn't mind signing this waiver now.
You never forget business for a minute, do you?
Why, yes, I do. Sometimes.
Bet not for more than a minute.
Well, I am rather anxious to get this signed.
I'd like to get back to New York.
If you remember, I told you
I wouldn't sign anything...
- until after I've had that vacation.
- Why not?
How do I know I wouldn't be thrown out of here the minute you left?
Why, that's ridiculous.
That's not the way our company does business.
Maybe not, but you can't be too careful of these big corporations.
- I don't think they'll get away with anything with you.
- [ Chuckles ]
Well, what would you like to do first?
See the sights?
All right. But you'll have to wait till I swim across that bathtub and back.
I'll be in the bar when you're ready.
[ Barking ]
" Sugar is the greatest industry of the Cuban Republic...
" and a visit to its vast sugarcane fields will afford moments of rare interest.
"Hundreds of thousands of Cubans are concerned directly or indirectly...
"with the production or marketing of this commodity.
"The cutting season extends from December toJune, and the cane is cut with machetes.
"Oxen are still used to till the fields and haul the cane to railroad cars.
" During 1940,
1,174,369 tons...
" were exported to the United States alone.
- At Havana's door, there are"-
- Now wait a minute.
When you asked me to go sightseeing, you really meant it, didn't you?
I thought it was a pretty drive, but what would you rather see?
Well, I understand there are countless bars and numberless nightclubs in Havana.
Oh, I'd planned on taking you to one tonight.
There's a place called Midi's that's supposed to be very nice.
Midi's? All the tourists go there.
I'll bet if I was seeing Havana with Arnold Spreckles... he wouldn't take me to any second-rate nightclub.
Where do you think
Arnold Spreckles would take you?
Mmm, the Casino " Madelino. "
All right. We'll go there.
Anything that Spreckles can do... the McCracken Steamship Company ought to be able to do.
Think so?

No. No, thank you. Not right now.

You don't rhumba. You fox-trot.
Look, Miss Spencer, I've done my level best to show you a good time.
I've shown you the sights.
You're at the best nightclub in town.
You have orchids and champagne.
What else do you want?
You wouldn't know.

Would it make you any happier if I made love to you?
Isn't that a little out of your line?
Hmm. Anything to please you.

What do you suggest?
Well, for a starter, let's part company.
But you can't just go around alone.
Why not? I can have as dull a time alone as I can with you.
And besides, who said I had to be alone?

Seńorita, do not go.
I have seen hundreds of women standing there... and I have kept right on smoking.
But you, seńorita-
- Are you alone?
- Well, no.
I mean, I- I came with a man, but- but I'm going home alone.
Oh, well, one of two things happened, seńorita.
You were insulted, or you were not insulted.
And beyond that, you are not going home alone.
I am Monte Blanca.
- Uh, shall we go now?
- Oh, but I don't even know you.
[ Laughs ]

- Hello.
Much to my amazement,
I have brought you home.
- Yes, you could knock me over with a feather too.
- Really?
- Thanks a lot, Mr. Blanca.
- And what time tomorrow night shall I call?
Oh, you're-you're calling tomorrow night?
Oh, this is what is known as a preliminary flirtation.
- And, uh, what's tomorrow night?
- Saturday.
Then I can definitely make it.
It's my maid's night out.
Good. We will go to the casino again... but upstairs to the tables, if you like.
- Oh, it sounds exciting.
- Being with you will be exciting even if we lose.
[ Laughs ]
Well-
- Buenas noches, seńorita.
- Uh-
"Bonas"noches.
Oh, excuse me.
You, uh, are sure she is wealthy?
It is the surest thing in the whole world.
She has the most expensive suite in the hotel.
Her clothes-They are the most luxurious and thinnest I have ever seen.
And if this is not proof enough, she tipped me only 10 cents.
- She must be very wealthy.
- [ Chuckles ]
You will get your whole payment in a lump... and if your information is not accurate, it will be a lump on the head.
- Seńor.
- Good evening.
- Seńor Williams, for you.
- Thank you.
Hmm.
- Where can I send a cable?
- I'm sorry, seńor. The office is closed.
- Can I take your answer?
- Yes.

Oh, I think something with a black edge around it might be appropriate.

The one in the middle is the lucky table.
The croupier is color-blind.
Oh, wonderful!
No more bets, please.
Evening, Flores.
[ Flores ] Fourteen, red.
Fourteen, the winner.
- Astack of the blues, please.
- Blues?
- For the young lady. They will match her eyes.
- [ Chuckles ]
- One stack of blacks.
- How much are they?
Who cares?
To you, they are nothing but chips.
[ Man ]
Thirty-three, the winner.
Uh, while you are playing,
I would like to make a call.
- Oh, but don't be too long.
- Oh, I'll be back before you break the bank.
[ Flores ]
Place your bets, please.
[ Continues, Fades ]
[ Chuckles ]
Hello, Boris. How are you?
Glad to see you here, Monte.
Saves me the trouble of sending for you.
Oh, I would have come up yesterday, only I had not, uh, yet made my arrangements.
Funeral?
No, financial.
[ Chuckles ]
But I am going to pay tonight- perhaps the whole thing.
It's, uh, exactly $750.
Well, I cannot give it to you this minute, Boris, but you are going to get it.
You are going to get more than that.
I, uh, brought a very rich girl here tonight.
She owns half of America.
She loses thousands every night.
That becomes interesting.
All right. I'll have the croupier suspend the table limit while you're playing.
If the young lady lives up to your expectations...
I'll credit your account with five percent of all she loses.
Well, she will have to lose a great deal.
Don't you think 10% is a little more equitable?
I don't want to haggle with you, Monte.
You'll either get five percent of the young lady's losses... or a hundred percent of what
I planned for you before you came in.
[ Laughing ]
Well, five percent is perfectly satisfactory.
- I was just trying to get the best deal I could.
- You have.
[ Chuckles ]
- Well, I'll see you later, eh, Boris?
- Do.

- [ Roulette Ball Rattles ]
- [ Flores ] Fourteen, red. Fourteen, the winner.
That's me. That's me again!
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Oh, Monte! You were right about this table being lucky.
Look, I won it all on 14.
Fourteen again!
No, no, no, no. You must not bet on that again. It could never repeat.
Oh, that's what everybody's been telling me.
No, a good roulette player is one who knows how to change.
- Now this time you should bet heavily on eight.
- Eight? Why?
Well, uh, eight and six make 14.
The next time, you bet on six.
It's an infallible system.
Well, you were right about this being a lucky table...
- so, uh, I'll change to eight.
- Number eight.
- Thank you.
- Uh, a little more.
- Yes, sir.
- [ Chuckles ]
[ Flores ]
No more bets, please.
[ Roulette Ball Rattling ]
[ Flores ] Eight, black.
Eight, the winner.
Oh, that's me.
That's me again!
- Oh, Monte, you're wonderful!
- Uh, yes, I am.
You don't seem very excited, but I guess you do this every night.
This or cut my throat.
- Seńor?
- Hmm?
Oh, uh, stand.
Now we bet on six, don't we?
You know what I think I'll do?
I think I'll put everything on six.
[ Gasps ] No, no, no, no!
That-That would be wrong.
Oh, why? How could I lose with you helping me?
- I'm gonna do it. Everything on six.
- But-
- The whole thing, seńorita?
- The whole thing on six.
[ Flores ]
No more bets, please.
[ Ball Rattling ]
- [ Flores ] Fourteen, red. Fourteen, the winner.
- [ Gasps ]
Oh, Monte, I lost.
I knew I should've stuck to 14.
Oh, do not let a little thing like that worry you.
We will win it all back again.
We will just keep alternating from eight to six, from six to eight.
Acouple of stacks of the blues.
[ Flores ] Seven, red.
Seven, the winner.
- [ Nan ] Ah, we've lost again.
- [ Flores ] Place your bets, please.
[ Roulette Ball Rattling ]
[ Flores ]
Fourteen, red.
[ Nan ] Oh, we've lost again.
Monte, let's go.
[ Monte ] No, no, no.
When your luck is this bad, it is bound to change.
Give us four stacks, Flores.
Now we must start doubling up.
[ Flores ] Thirty-three, black.
Thirty-three, the winner.
- Uh, Flores, give us another stack of-
- No.
No matter what you say, that's enough for anyone to lose in one evening.
Oh, well, it does not matter.
Maybe tomorrow you will be luckier, eh?
- Flores, what are the young lady's losses?
Oh,just $3,000.
Seems like an awful lot to me, but if you enjoy it, it's up to you.
- What?
- Well, you didn't even have the fun of playing.
Take me a long time to earn that much.
What? Uh, you mean, if you had to work.
Oh, you can find me any day at Macy's from 9:30 to 5:30.
Macy's.
- What is Macy's?
- It's a big department store in New York.
Oh. [ Laughs ]
You own it.
No, no. I work there- in hosiery.
But- But surely you are not serious.
Your-Your hotel accommodations are not those of a shopgirl.
I'll say they're not. I'm traveling at the expense of the steamship company.
- Steamship company?
- That's right.
And I had the impression you were wealthy.
You are sure you are not wealthy?
Sure I'm sure.
Does it make any difference?
To me, difference?
Of course not.
What difference could it make to me?
Seńor Blanca, there is another call for you.
Oh, yes, a call.
Right away.
Uh, could you excuse me?
Wait here, please.
But don't play anymore.
So, she was a wealthy girl.
- No, look, Boris.
- She owns half of America.
- I can explain-
- She loses thousands every night.
Boris, please.
My information-There was a slip.
Yes, but luckily this time, Monte, you've landed on your feet... instead of where you usually land.
This gentleman has offered to make good the young lady's losses.
[ Chuckles ]
Thank you very much, seńor.
I, uh, suppose you have some way in mind that I can repay you.
That, too, has been arranged.
Oh, fine, fine.
But killing is out. I will not kill!
Look, Blanca. I'll make up the losses, but not all at once- payments of $500 at a time.
Seńor, naturally
I am more than grateful... but, uh, I still do not understand why.
Well, not because of your character.
After Miss Spencer went out with you last night, I looked you up.
As characters go, yours is not very good.
Oh, they're a lot of rumors.
They are not true.
Well, never mind. Miss Spencer seems to like you and to have a good time with you.
For business reasons,
I want her to continue to have a good time.
The moment she stops having a good time,
I stop paying Boris.
And I wouldn't like that, Monte.
Seńor, I assure you, you will have no cause to discontinue the payments.
I will do my best to make
Seńorita Spencer ecstatic.
That ought to be good enough. You Cubans are supposed to be experts at romance.
Oh, I am not a Cuban, seńor.
I was born in Brooklyn as a child.
But I have a feel for romance.
Of course, uh, properly done, it is, uh, expensive.
I understand.
Here's, um, $50.
When that's gone, I'll give you more, but no gambling.
Oh, seńor, I would not gamble again if my life depended on it.
[ Match Scratches ]
And it does. [ Chuckles ]
Hasta luego.
- Place your bets, please.
- [ Woman ] On four.
- [ Clears Throat ] Ah!
- All ready?
I'm sorry I was detained so long, but I ran into the manager, so I wrote him a check.
Then of course nothing would do but I should have a drink with him.
- You know how it goes.
- But I still feel guilty.
What, about $3,000?
Oh, forget it.
[ Flores ] Fourteen, red.
Fourteen, the winner.
Oh, you know, I knew we should've stuck to that number.
- It's come up at least five times since you left.
- Really?
- Well.
- Oh, now look. You've spent enough for tonight.
Oh, but this is nothing-just $50.
Uh, $50 on 14.
- No more bets, please.
- Cigarette?
[ Nan ]
No, thanks.
[ Roulette Ball Rattles ]
[ Flores ] Twenty-two, black.
Twenty-two, the winner.
- Shall we go?
- We should've gone long ago.
- Uh, will you excuse me while I get my wrap?
- Oh, but of course.
[ Chuckles ]
Thank you.
[ Woman ]
Uh-huh.!
Now I have got you where you want me.
Oh, Rosita mía, never have you looked more lovely.
And never have you looked more guilty!
Where have you been?
Shh.
I have been here and there and smoking and thinking of you.
And what did you think of your blonde?
- Uh-The blonde? - Yeah, yeah. I am told you were upstairs with a blonde.
But there are many blondes upstairs.
If you stand next to a woman, it is 35-to-1 she is a blonde.
It was not 35 blondes.
It was one blonde.
- Ah! Ah, you mean the blonde seńorita.
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, she is a friend of a business friend of mine, Seńor Williams.
Business, huh?
You are giving me the business.
How many times have you promised me not to go upstairs and gamble my money?
But I am not gambling with your money.
I stroll up to the casino almost every evening, but only to test myself.
I look on, I watch the little ball roll and it does nothing to me.
I say, " Monte, you are cured. "
Oh, to do that is to show character.
Hmm, show me some money.
Oh, you artists are all alike- temperamental, volatile, unreasonable.
When I get my money back,
I'm going to be very reasonable.
- I'm going to make you scram and get a new manager.
- Huh?
[ Chuckles ]
No, you will never do that.
Where would you find another manager like me, huh?
Mmm, that's right.
No one can manage me like you do.
But you are a thief and a no-good good-for-nothing.
- Oh, but I like you.
- Mmm.
Oh, no, no. One more kiss, and I forget how to dance.
- Run along. I will watch every movement from here.
- Mmm.

Seńor Williams, Seńorita Rivas was just inquiring for you.
- How do you do, Seńorita Rivas?
- Are you the man with the blonde?
- I don't own one. I know one.
- Hmm.
Come on. Let's go away from this " eavesdripper. "
Your blonde is on the chase for my manager.
Really, Seńorita Rivas.
I think you have the wrong impression.
Besides, I'm sure that any interest Miss Spencer... might have in your manager is purely platonic.
" Plutonic" or not, when I catch her,
I'll pull all her hair out. Where are they?
I- I haven't the faintest idea.
Miss Spencer said something about attending a lecture on tropical fish.
- Mm-hmm.
- Anyway, I'm positive they're not around here.
Then I'll sit and wait until the cows go home.
Sometime she'll have to come back.
Maybe Monte will not like her so much without any hair.
You're much too concerned about this, seńorita.
Why don't you just run along and forget the whole thing?
I forget nothing, and I don't run.
You can take my word for it.
There's no reason to be jealous.
Jealous? Who's jealous?
I am not jealous.
Well, if you're gonna wait around the lobby and ambush Miss Spencer...
- someone is bound to get that impression.
- With me, it's all business.
I- If you don't mind my saying so...
I think you're making a mistake following them around this way.
- You have pride, haven't you?
- Yeah. Yeah. I have it.
Sometimes I have so much pride
I could blow up.
Then show it. Be independent.
Get yourself a new manager.
Oh, no, no.
I could not do that.
No one can manage me as well as Monte.
- How do you know?
- I have a feeling.
That's only because you've never tried anyone else.
You think so? That would be a good lesson for him, huh?
Sure it would.
Show him you don't need him.
Yah. Yah. I will show him that.
But where will I get a new manager?
Uh, let's go someplace we can talk it over.
Oh, no, no. I have no time now to go someplace. I have rehearsal.
But tonight I can talk if you'll come to the casino.
Don't you think the casino's a little crowded?
Yeah. You're right.
It's full of busy biddies.
I know a little inn in the country.
Arbolado's.
- I'll meet you there at 10:00. Huh?
- Fine.
You better run along. I don't want you to be late for your rehearsal.
- Why hurry? I am only late one hour.
- [ Gasps ]
- Huh?
- Let's go through the kitchen.
I always like to see what they're gonna have for dinner.
I ride all around singing
Buy a lollipop, buy a lollipop
You'll hear my bell ringing
Buy a lollipop, buy a lollipop
Ah, seńorita, how many
The moon on a stick for a penny
You'll hear children echoing
Buy a lollipop, buy a lollipop
Merrily swinging along
You all can be-
Welcome, seńor. Welcome.
- Is this Arbolado's?
- I am Arbolado. Come in, seńor. Come in.
You honor my house to enter into it.
I'm looking for a young lady.
I know a redhead.
I could get her here in 10 minutes.
No, no. I'm supposed to meet this young lady here. Seńorita Rivas.
- Oh. You are the young man she's expecting.
- Yes.
She's upstairs. This way, seńor.
This room down here is only for those who can't pay for anything better.
" Tightskates" and the " cheapwads. "
You know, seńor, this house is very romantic.
The very famous pirate Morgan... used to come ashore here and make love to the wife of the governor-general.
Their rendezvous was in this very room.
Here is the marks made by his cutlass on the way in.
You will find the champagne by the table.
- When you are ready for supper,just ask.
- Thanks.
- Good evening, seńorita.
- Ah. Buenas noches, seńor.
Are you good at corks pulling?
Well, most of my experience has been with beer cans.
- Ah. Did you have any troubles finding the road?
- Was that what I came over?
You certainly picked an out-of-the-way place for our conference.
You do not like this place?
I think it's terrific.
It has a nice balcony.
Come to see.
- You see? Nice, huh?
- Mmm. Very nice.
- And you said you did not want to be in a crowd.
- Well, that was to avoid Monte.
If you really want to teach him a lesson, don't see him. Have nothing to do with him.
I have nothing to do with him plenty.
And what kind of manager did you get for me, huh?
Uh, rather good, I think.
You're going to be a little surprised.
Surprised?
Ooh. I like surprises.
They tickle me in here.
- Well, I'm your new manager.
- Huh?
Now, before you say anything, listen.
I've never managed any artist before... but I've had a lot of experience in management.
- Yes?
- And I'll really handle your affairs right.
If I do say so myself,
I'm a- I'm a good businessman.
Never mind the buildups.
I think I'll like you.
- Thanks.
- You are good-looking.
Uh- [ Chuckles Nervously ]
Thank you.
You are big and strong.
Well, I've had the usual childhood diseases... but I think I'm well enough to handle any deals that come up.
- Kiss me.
- What?
- Kiss me.
- Well, I guess we might as well seal the bargain.
I guess.
Mmm! I think you'll be a wonderful manager.
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.
Oh, that's all right. That's all right.
Uh, let us sit on the couch, huh?
Well, d-don't you think
I'd better order dinner first?
- Oh, no.
- Well, I didn't have any lunch, and I-
- I better get 'em started.
- I pour the champagne, huh?
[ Arbolado ] Oh,yes, seńorita.
This house is very romantic.
You know that very famous pirate Morgan?
He used to come ashore here... and make love to the wife of the governor-general.
This was their rendezvous.
- Maybe you're right. It- It is a little early for dinner. - Ah. Here.
Now, come sit by me, huh?
[ Door Closes ]
I think we'd better go.
Who is going?
We have only just arrived.
I know, but I'm tired of this place.
I'm that way.
I like to go places.
You know, make the rounds.
Oh, but I like here.
The champagne is so good.
- We are lonely. We're just two together.
- [ Champagne Cork Pops ]
Yeah, but we're liable to be four any minute.
Oh, come sit down.
We make rounds some other times, huh?
- It's warm in here, isn't it?
- Mmm.
- We put the couch in the balcony.
- Oh, no, no, no.
- It's too much work.
- Oh, no, no. There are rolls underneath. Look.
- [ Wheels Squeaking ]
- And you see? Somebody else do the same thing.
- Come on. Help me.
- Oh, we'd only clutter up the place.
After all, they were there first.
I wonder who they are.
I will take one look like a Peeking Thomas.
No, no. You mustn't.
How would you like someone peeking at you?
If I did not know,
I would not care.
- Well, let's just sit down in here.
- All right. All right.
Now, if I'm going to handle your affairs... there are a few things
I'll have to know.
Oh. You will find out little by little.
No. We'll have to get this down in black and white.
Now, what kind of a contract did you have with Monte?
It was a verbal contract, but I tear it up.
Well, how much commission did you pay him?
Commission?
He just took everything.
Oh. That's not right.
Ten percent is customary.
Tell me. Do you have to wear those glasses?
No. They're only reading glasses.
Then you'll not need them.
Take them off. I do not like it.
Now... kiss me.
Seńorita Rivas, it's been proven time and again.
In- In business deals of this sort... things work out better if- if client and agent remain aloof.
Maybe you do not like to manage me, huh?
- Maybe I go back to Monte.
- No. I- I'm crazy to manage-
Then show it!
Hmm. I know I go back to Monte.
- Now do you think I can manage you?
- Mmm! I give you 20%. Mmm!
Mmm.
[ Chuckles ]
Somebody threw a cigarette on our balcony.
Ah.
Rosita, don't go out there.
I knew it! I knew it!
The minute I turn my back, you go behind it with the blonde, huh?
Rosita, please. No matter what this appears like to you, it is the opposite.
You stole! You lied! You gambled!
And I'm stood for it.
But not now. You are through.
- I have a new manager!
- No, Rosita. Please. What I have been doing I have done for you.
You make me laugh. Ha-ha.
For me, huh?
For me you are chase with that little blonde " floogie"?
- Hey. You can't call me a floozy.
- Oh, can't I?
- Floogie, floogie.
- No, no. Please, Rosita. Listen to me.
I have spent your money.
I have lost at gambling. I have lied to you.
- But never have I been untrue to you.
- Yeah, yeah. I believe it.
I have only gone with Seńorita Spencer because I lost your money.
I was trying to earn some to give back to you.
Seńor Williams paid me to take her out.
- What?
- What?
Wait a minute.
Come on, you.
Come on.
Is it true what this liar say?
- Well-
- Oh, so you had to arrange even this, you- you heel!
Ah! And ah!
Miss Spencer.
Miss Spencer.
You were in such a hurry, I thought you might have overlooked your check... so I took the liberty of calling it to your attention.
Okay, okay.
How much is it?
Two bottles champagne, 9.90.
Two suppers, $10.
- We didn't have any supper.
- Call it cover charge.
- Oh!
- [ Groans ]
Stay out of this, will ya?
Thank you.
What's the big idea?
You forgot your change, seńor.
Miss Spencer.
Miss Spencer, listen.
- If you'll only listen.
- Will you quit following me? I'm through with you.
- I don't blame you, but if-
- Oh!
[ Vehicle Approaching ]
[ Crash ]
Well, I saw it coming at us, and I did the first thing that popped into my mind.
- Oh.
- For a moment I thought you lost your temper.
I should think for a person as efficient as you... you'd put your brakes on when you park your car.
- I thought I did.
- Well, you didn't. Help me up.
Oh. Take your hands off me.
Hmm.
Oh, I should have let it hit you.
I've ruined my stockings.
I'll buy you a new pair. In fact,
I'll buy you a dozen pairs for saving my life.
Size nine, coral sand. And you can send me a pair of crutches along with them.
It looks like I'm gonna walk back to town with you whether you like it or not.
Oh, I wouldn't feel comfortable without you trailing me.
I'm sorry about that mix-up at Arbolado's.
It's the first time a man ever had to be paid to kiss me.
Well, you weren't having any fun with me... and you seemed to be enjoying yourself with Blanca.
Well, at least he could dance, and he didn't show me any sugarcane.
Well, all I can say is, again, I'm sorry.
- Oh.
- What's the matter? Blisters already?
No, no. Gravel. These open-toed shoes weren't made for hiking.
Thanks.
- All I was trying to do was see that you had a-
- Oh!
Thank you.
I wonder how many miles it is to town.
Seventeen and 2/1 Oths miles.
Oh. Oh, I give up.
I've gotta sit down.
Oh. Seventeen miles.
My feet'll be worn down to the knees.
I'd carry you before I'd see those beautiful legs wrecked.
I guess I really ruined your vacation for you.
You certainly did.
I should have put you up at a hotel, given you an expense account... let you go on your own.
- I was trying too hard.
- I'll say you were.
I've never seen anyone work so hard to have a good time.
What happened to you anyway?
Were you frightened as a child?
Did your parents beat you?
You don't seem to know how to enjoy yourself.
Maybe I don't. All my life
I've been so busy trying to get ahead...
I never had time to worry about having fun.
Well, when you have to worry about having fun, you're hopeless.
I shouldn't be completely hopeless.
I'm young yet, and I'm willing to learn.
[ Chuckles ] You know, there's a possibility you're human after all.
- Can I help you?
- No. No, thanks.
No sense in me putting this back on again.
I'm here till we're rescued. Oh.
Well, you might as well be comfortable.
- Oh, no. You don't have to do that.
- It doesn't matter.
- There you are.
- [ Sighs ]
- That better?
- Mm-hmm.
- [ Snap ]
- [ Groans ]
What have you got in your pocket?
Asupply of waivers?
I don't know. Let's see.
Oh. Oh, I broke your glasses.
- Well, what's so funny about it?
- Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't help being glad.
You might have slipped into them any minute and ruined everything.
Why does everybody hate these glasses?
Because when you get behind 'em, you're a cold fish.
The rest of the time you're sort of nice.
Well, it looks like I'll have to choose between being nice... and being able to read my correspondence.
Don't you think your chances of getting any mail out here are a little thin?
Well, now that you mention it, we are sort of cut off from everything.
Doesn't it make you a little nervous?
No. Not a bit.
- Why?
- Mmm, I don't know.
Anything might happen.
[ Sighs ] That was right in character.
Brief, cool and businesslike.
Bet if your glasses weren't broken, you'd have 'em on.
The last woman that made a crack about these glasses was practically decapitated.
Tropical magic
Strange fascination
Moon of temptation
In a black velvet sky
Tropical magic
Lost in your splendor
Love will surrender
- To a kiss
- Then a sigh
Whispering shadows
Out of a midnight
W hisper mańana
But never good-bye
Music is playing
Tropical magic
Here am I saying
Adios to my heart
Adios
To my heart
[ Bellhop ]
Tropical magic, strange fascination
Moon of temptation in a black velvet sky
[ Humming ]
Stop singing that song, will ya?
Oh, I am sorry, seńor. You see, it is sort of a song one cannot get out of one's mind.
- I didn't order breakfast.
- I know, seńor, but it is noon.
If you're not quite ready, it is all right.
You see, I have the burners to keep the bottoms warm.
All right. I'll eat it.
I am hungry.
But not that hungry.
You've got two breakfasts here.
Of course, seńor.
One is for the young lady.
I requested extra-large portions.
What are you talking about?
What young lady?
- [ Chuckles ] Seńor.
- There's no young lady here.
Not even Seńorita Spencer?
Seńorita Spencer is just a business acquaintance of mine.
Seńor, you forget.
I was on duty last night.
I haven't forgotten it.
I didn't even know it.
When you come in, you had eyes for only each other.
You bumped into a chair, but you did not notice.
Your hands were locked.
That, Seńor Williams, is no business connection.
Besides, it was
5:30 in the morning.
Our car broke down.
It took us all night to get back to the hotel.
And then, at the elevator, you stopped... and a long kiss ensued.
No. That, Seńor Williams, is not business connection.
You're right.
That was pure insanity.
- [ Knocks ]
- Yes?
- "Bonas"días.
- Hello.
Hello. Oh, I hope you didn't promise that other breakfast to anyone else. I'm famished.
Well, as a matter of fact, I was just going to call you. I- I wanted to talk to you.
I thought maybe you might have breakfast with me.
Oh, I'd love to, now that
I've invited myself. Hello.
- Seńorita.
- Thank you.
Seńor. I will return with some more coffee... and- [ Chuckles ] and knock.
- [ Laughs ]
- Oh,Jay, darling. I'm so happy, I could kick my heels together.
I've been doing a little kicking myself this morning.
- Nan.
- What, darling?
- Eggs?
- Oh. I'd love some.
I don't know where I get all this appetite.
Usually I never eat breakfast.
Oh! Potato.
- Aren't you gonna eat anything?
- Eat?
Oh. Yes. Sure.
[ Sighs ]
Wasn't last night gorgeous?
You know, if I live to be a thousand,
I couldn't forget a moment of it.
- You couldn't?
- Never.
Neither could I.
- Jay, darling.
- Yes?
- I have a present for you.
- You have?
Mm-hmm.
The waiver. I wrote it myself.
I said I'd sign it if my vacation was as good as I thought it should be... but it was better than I ever dreamed.
Well, thanks, Nan.
I would have given it to you whether I had a good time or not, but-
Oh, I just thought
I'd wait till the last day.
But now, I don't want you worrying about business anymore because we're too happy.
[ Chuckles ]
- Sugar?
- No, thanks. I never use it.
- Oh.
- [ Knocks ]
- Come in.
- [ Door Opens ]
Good morning.
I guess this is what I came to find out.
Didn't even have to take my hat off.
Well, good-bye.
I hope to see you again sometime.
Terry, wait a minute.
Terry, what are you doing down here?
Oh, I read a few cables on Father's desk.
He was urging you on to a love affair, and you were reporting satisfactory progress.
So I thought I'd better come down and see what you meant by satisfactory.
- Now I know.
- [Jay ] I don't think you do.
Nan, I'm sick about this.
I- I didn't want it thrown at you this way.
No? Well, how did you want it thrown at me?
Terry's my fiancée.
We've been in love a long time.
Up until last night, there was no reason to tell you.
It's probably hard for you to believe, but I was gonna tell you today.
I'll say it's hard to believe.
Why did you have to wait until today?
I don't know. I just didn't.
I don't know why.
Well, I know why. You couldn't get this from me any other way, so you made love to me.
Well, you just try to get me to sign another one!
Nan, please.
Oh, Terry. This is a mess. Honest.
I didn't make love to her to get that thing signed.
- Well, why did you,Jay?
- I don't know.
How do these things ever happen?
Just say she's attractive, and there was a lot of moonlight, and- and I'm no tin god.
I think we'd better go back to New York and get married as soon as possible.
How can I?
I still have to get that thing signed.
You don't think she's gonna sign it now, do you?
You're licked, and there's nothing to do but go home.
I'm not going to give up.
I'm gonna stay here till I get it.
Now listen,Jay.
It's about time you realized... that my wedding is more important to me than your stupid business.
- What do you suppose my friends are saying?
- Is that so important?
Well, it is to me. Well, Terry, there's no reason to get so angry about it.
I'm not angry. I'm furious.
I'm going back on the afternoon plane.
I'll drop in and say good-bye before I leave.
[ Crying ]
[ Crying ]
[ Knocks ]
Could you spare me a minute?
Come in.
Miss Spencer, there's been a lot of nonsense about this waiver.
Jay's tried to woo it out of you, but I think we can drop that approach.
All right. It's dropped.
I have a cashier's check here for a thousand dollars.
It's yours if you'll sign it right now.
- Is this Jay's idea?
- Yes.
Well, why didn't he come to me himself?
Well, naturally, he was embarrassed.
You read more into his attitude than he meant to convey.
I can't deny that.
All right. Give it to me.
Anything to get this over with.
There you are.
But you don't have to buy it from me.
It's only steamship money.
You might as well have it as the stockholders.
You can consider it a sort of consolation prize.
Of course, you realize that I know what you were really after.
I think you'd better be leaving about now.
It's too bad the shopgirl's dream is over.
[ Knocks ]
- For you, Seńor Williams.
- Thanks. Just a minute.
[ Laughs ]
Thank you.
[ Terry ] Rex Stallings came up for the wedding... but after the second time we postponed it... he had to go back home because his wife was getting a divorce.
- What's that?
- It's the waiver. She signed it and sent it to me.
Why, that's wonderful. Congratulations.
She certainly changed her mind in a hurry.
I can't understand it.
Well, you don't have to understand it.
You've got it, haven't you?
Yes, I have. It's a lucky break.
I hope she's not too mad to see me and let me thank her.
Oh, that would be a mistake.
She's made her decision. Let it go at that.
- Don't rake it all over again.
- You're right, of course.
- Now we can both take that plane back this afternoon.
- Sure.
- Monte.
- Seńorita, I will apologize later... but if you want to save my life, let me in.
- What's the matter?
- Seńorita, I would never have been a party... to the recent deception if it had not been a matter of life and death.
Now I am afraid it is going to be death.
Death?
What are you talking about?
I only accepted
Seńor Williams's offer... because I was in desperate need of money to pay gambling losses.
When our romance stopped, seńorita,
Seńor Williams's payments stopped.
And Seńor Boris who owns the casino gave me
12 hours to pay up. And that was yesterday.
So you can see for yourself that even now
I am living on borrowed time.
Oh, seńorita, please. I beg of you.
Use your influence with Seńor Williams.
Urge him to resume payments.
After all, I did my best.
And a good word from you might have the most desirable results.
I'm never gonna see
Seńor Williams again. Never.
Then I die. When you leave, my body will be floating in the harbor.
No, it won't, Monte.
I think I can help you out.
There's a thousand dollars in here.
Oh, seńorita, you are clever.
What a place to hide money.
Oh, you do not know what this means to me.
- There you are.
- Seńorita, you're an angel.
This is even more than I owe Boris.
I will bring you back the change.
No. Keep the change.
I never want to see a cent of that money.
Seńorita, I feel it necessary to get to Boris as quickly as possible.
But afterwards, I will come back and express my gratitude properly.
- [ Sighs ]
- [ Door Closes ]
- [ Knocks ]
- Come in.
Seńorita, a message for you.
From him.
I've seen enough shoplifters in my life.
I should have known her type.
- I'll show her.
- Seńorita, what is wrong?
That check.
I've gotta find that-
Oh. Oh!
- Seńorita, where are you going?
- To the casino.
Monte.! Aha.!
- So you are going upstairs.
- Only to test myself.
You are through testing yourself.
It is too expensive!
Querida mía, how can I gamble when I have no money?
When I have proved that with my own eyes,
I still not believe it.
No, Rosita! No!
[ Giggles ] No.
- Let me search you.
- With me it is a question of dignity.
- Can't you wait until you're asked?
- No!
No, Rosita.
[ Speaking Spanish ]
Come back here.
Come back here.
- [ Screams ]
- Rosita, no!
No. No.
Rosita, por favor. Rosita, please.
People are looking.
They'll not be disappointed.
I'm going to tear all your clothes off.
- No, Rosita. Please.
- [ Screams ]
Excuse me, please.
No. Por favor, Rosita.
Pardon me.
- Aha!
- Aha!
- Give it to me!
- Oh. Excuse me. I will not.
- Give it to me.
- Ow! Ooh. You are an animal. You have teeth like a tiger.
- And you have teeth like a snake.
- [ Roulette Ball Rattles ]
[ Flores ] Fourteen, red.
Fourteen, the winner.
[ Monte Gasps ]
[ Whimpering ]
This table is closed, seńores.
- [ Whimpers ]
- What happened?
- [ Coughs ] We have won.
- Much?
I don't know.
Maybe I own the whole casino.
Monte. Monte.
- I hate to ask you, but I have to have that check back.
- The check?
- Yes.
- Oh, yes. The check. Of course. Here it is.
- Oh, thanks a lot, Monte.
- Oh, no. Thank you for letting me use it.
- When you kiss somebody, kiss me.
- Please. Rosita.
You have come at a very dramatic time in my life.
I have just won a fortune, and I am never going to gamble again.
- I'm not even going to match pennies.
- What do you mean?
You can make money this fast, and you are going to stop now?
You are not a man.
You are a fish!
Rosita, you are telling me to gamble?
Why should I have to shake my hips every night... sing at the top of my lungs when you can make money this easy?
Look. This table's still in business.
- Maybe I will own all of Cuba.
- Mmm! Put them- Put them here.
I might even have two suits.
- [ Woman ] Have a nice trip.
- [ Man ] We will.
- [ Man ] Seńor Williams.
- Yes?
- For you, seńor.
- Thank you.
Yes, sir.
- We're ready to take off, sir. Will you please get aboard?
- Right away.
Oh. So you paid Nan for that waiver.
Well, you must have thought
I was an awful dope... congratulating me for something you swung yourself.
What does that matter?
You got the waiver, didn't you?
It's the way I got it I don't like.
That's kind of a cheap trick, Terry.
There's nothing cheap about it.
I was willing to pay a thousand for it.
Darling, please.
They're holding the plane.
- If you don't get aboard, we'll have to take off without you.
- We're coming right away.
What I want to know is why you did it.
What in the world got into you?
Let's get aboard. We can examine my motives all the way to New York.
All right, but I still don't like it.
[ Orchestra: Upbeat ]
Let's have fun and do the ńango
Everyone should do the ńango
It is done in every smart café
Even though you can't pronounce it
W hen the band begins to bounce it
That's your cue to dance the Cuban way
Everywhere you'll see the gang go
Simply wild about the ńango
Specially when it's fiesta day
You'll adore the innovation
Stopping for a conversation
But you've got to know just what to say
Just tell her
That you love the gleam in her dreamy eyes
And then pronto
She'll kiss you, seńor
Then tell her
It was grandioso, so amoroso
And pronto, pronto
She'll kiss you once more
Then you'll know the reason it went over with a " bang-o"
From New York to Pango-pango
You will yearn to get your turn to
Learn to do the ńango
[ Vocalizing ]
Come on, everybody, dance
Everyone should learn to do it
There is really nothing to it
Be a jitterbugs the Cuban way
[ Chorus ]
Doo, doo, doo, do the ńango
It's so hot, and it's so pleasant
There is no time like the present
[ All ]
There's the floor, come on, seńor
And learn to do the ńango
[ Chorus ]
Everywhere you'll see the gang go
Simply wild about the ńango
Specially when it's fiesta day
Da, da, da, da, da
You'll adore the innovation
Stopping for a conversation
But you've got to know just what to say
Jay!
What are you doing here?
I'm better at this than the rhumba.
Don't you think?
What happened to that fiancée of yours?
She went on to New York.
I found things a little rough over Miami... so I turned back.
Hope you gave her back that check.
That's all I hope.
I did. That's what made it so rough over Miami.
Well, don't think you can dance in here and square yourself with me in one breath.
Well, I can try, can't I, sugar?
Seńor, $500 would save my life.
- It isn't worth it.
- No?
Well, make me an offer.
[ Vocalizing ]
- Come on along and spend the weekend in Havana
- [ Vocalizing ]
Underneath a Cuban moon
W here stars are dancing rhumbas
In the sky-ay-ay
If you would like to spend the weekend in Havana
[ Vocalizing ]
- You'd better pack up all your summer clothes
- [ Vocalizing ]
See you down at SloppyJoe's
Find your seventh heaven in Havana
Brik-a-baka, ba-ba, ba
Havana
Havana
Let's have fun and do the ńango
Everyone should do the ńango
Here's the floor, come on, seńor
And learn to do
The ńango
{2941}{2989}- Hi, Jim.|- Hello, Bill. Cold enough?
{2993}{3050}You're darn right.|You got any passengers?
{3054}{3104}No. Just a few actors.
{3108}{3152}- Hiya, neighbor.|- Hiya.
{3156}{3207}- You a couple of actors?|- That's right.
{3211}{3259}You don't look like actors.
{3264}{3347}I got a piece of news for you.|This doesn't look like a town.
{3359}{3406}- Say, that's a nifty!|- You like that?
{3410}{3483}What do you think of this?|Know what Julius Caesar said...
{3487}{3527}...when Brutus stabbed him?|- No.
{3532}{3593}- Ouch!|- Ouch.
{3600}{3651}That's all right.|Where did you get that?
{3656}{3719}That's one of my father's jokes.
{3724}{3781}What are you, one of your mother's?
{3791}{3856}Say, he looks like an actor.
{3871}{3929}You called it, friend.|Harry Palmer, single O.
{3933}{3984}- How you doing?|- Hi. I'm Jimmy Metcalfe...
{3988}{4034}How you doing? Glad to see you.
{4038}{4129}Well, hiya, chicks.|Meet Harry Palmer, headliner.
{4133}{4211}- Do we have to answer that?|- Bus for the hotel! The hotel bus!
{4215}{4244}- Is that it?|- Yes, sir.
{4248}{4331}Go ahead, kids. Get in the bus.|Sid and I will bring the bags.
{4416}{4483}Hello, Springtime.
{4498}{4551}Aren't you a little out of season?
{4604}{4664}Who's the guy with the squirrel|around his neck?
{4668}{4767}- Single act, name of Palmer.|- His act can't be as funny as that coat.
{4896}{4961}Hey, how do you like this billing?
{4965}{5070}"Harry Palmer, America's|foremost comedy juggler and dancer."
{5074}{5146}That's the way it's gonna read|someday at the Palace too.
{5150}{5210}Say, how long you been|with this stale act?
{5214}{5274}Are you kidding?|Jimmy Metcalfe has a great act.
{5278}{5319}And it's gonna be better too.
{5324}{5394}Wait till you hear the terrific arrangement|he's buying.
{5398}{5467}- Arrangement? Where?|- Right here. The orchestra leader.
{5471}{5539}He writes sensational stuff.
{5556}{5633}Thanks, kid.|I'll give you a joke sometime.
{5660}{5743}Lou, you can't expect my girls to dress|way up on the third floor.
{5748}{5789}- They got changes.|- Sorry, Jimmy.
{5793}{5852}I hand out dressing rooms|according to billing.
{5856}{5927}I know, but Palmer won't mind.|He looks like a swell guy.
{5931}{5996}- Lf it's okay by Palmer, it's okay by me.|- Thanks!
{6000}{6079}Hey, kids! Kids, it's okay!|We're moving!
{6084}{6166}- Hiya, maestro. I'm Harry Palmer.|- How do you do?
{6171}{6222}I hear you got a terrific arrangement.
{6226}{6280}- How did you hear?|- Jimmy Metcalfe told me.
{6284}{6321}- He did?|- Sure.
{6325}{6384}Look, I'm breaking in a new act.
{6388}{6451}If the arrangement's good,|I'll give you 50 bucks.
{6455}{6519}- I promised it to Jimmy.|- He won't be needing it.
{6523}{6575}- That act is gonna fold any day.|- It is?
{6579}{6624}- Sure.|- Gee whiz.
{6628}{6680}- What do you say?|- I promised it to Jimmy.
{6684}{6762}- Fifty bucks.|- I sure can use that 50.
{6766}{6811}When Jimmy gets the act fixed up...
{6815}{6879}...we're not gonna have to play|these dumps anymore.
{6959}{7023}What's the idea of putting her|in my dressing room?
{7028}{7107}I'm sorry. The young ladies|in Mr. Metcalfe's act got changes.
{7112}{7191}I know when to be nice to young ladies.|I'm topping this bill...
{7196}{7307}...and I rate the number one room!|- Okay, Mr. Palmer. Okay.
{7379}{7450}Sorry, kids. Mr. Palmer insists|on having this room.
{7454}{7502}You'll have to dress upstairs.
{7506}{7588}Let's not keep the gentleman waiting.
{7600}{7687}- After all, he's number one.|- Yeah.
{7697}{7778}There's nothing lower than number one.
{8879}{8951}- I bet he bows every time he hears thunder.|- Yeah.
{9942}{10003}- See what I mean?|- I see what you mean. Go, Lily.
{10007}{10065}- Say, you know, I was...|- Pardon me.
{19704}{19763}- We weren't a three-alarm fire.|- Don't worry.
{19767}{19826}- We'll be a hit in bigger places.|- Hope so.
{19853}{19883}- Danny!|- Jo.
{19887}{19951}I'm glad to see you.|How'd you get out of school?
{19955}{20028}I told the dean you were playing.|He let me cut classes.
{20032}{20121}Well, that's wonderful! I'm sorry.|Jimmy, this is my brother, Danny.
{20125}{20179}- How do you do?|- Oh, glad to see you.
{20183}{20266}And I'm sure glad you're her brother.|Well, I'll see you later.
{20270}{20319}- Oh, don't go.|- Oh, no. You two go on.
{20324}{20424}Have a good talk. I'll see you in a while.|It's awfully nice to know you, Danny.
{20428}{20495}- He's a nice guy.|- He's the nicest fella you'll meet.
{20499}{20559}Come on. Sit down.|Now, tell me something.
{20564}{20635}- Same old thing.|- You beginning to feel like a doctor?
{20639}{20691}Well, I can spell "stethoscope."
{20695}{20783}Well, stand up. Well, stand up.|Come on.
{20790}{20877}Oh, boy! You're gonna be|a tall doctor.
{20899}{20979}Tell me, when do you|have to go back to school?
{20983}{21020}Jo...
{21024}{21095}I'm not going back.
{21104}{21192}- What?|- I'm not going back.
{21212}{21292}Why? What's the matter?|Did something happen at school?
{21296}{21377}- Oh, no, no. Nothing like that.|- Well, then what is it?
{21383}{21447}Well, it just doesn't make sense.
{21451}{21526}I sit in a nice, warm dormitory,|and you wear yourself out...
{21530}{21629}...in a lot of Clifton Junctions.|- What kind of talk is that?
{21633}{21703}- I just saw your act.|- What's the matter with our act?
{21707}{21780}Oh, nothing. Nothing's the matter with it.|You're great.
{21784}{21858}It just seems to me|the act isn't getting anywhere.
{21862}{21932}- Lf you didn't have me around your neck...|- Listen to me.
{21936}{21997}You ought to be ashamed,|talking to me like that.
{22001}{22070}Didn't we make a deal once?|Well, didn't we?
{22074}{22152}You go through medical school|and pay me back with interest.
{22156}{22239}This is a fine time to quit.|Your last year. You're doing great.
{22244}{22313}- I'm not gonna let you quit.|- But, Jo...
{22317}{22388}What do you want to be?|A no-good tramp or something?
{22422}{22460}Danny.
{22486}{22546}You're not working any hardship on me.
{22550}{22637}Don't you see, honey?|I love it. I'd be doing it anyway.
{22641}{22701}And you're gonna stay in medical school.
{22705}{22793}I gotta make sure somebody in this family|is a success.
{22851}{22905}All aboard!
{22940}{23000}- So long.|- Don't forget to send that picture.
{23004}{23034}- Yeah.|- All aboard!
{23038}{23069}- I better be going.|- Bye.
{23073}{23112}Goodbye.
{23146}{23198}We're gonna be all right, you and I.
{23202}{23274}Goodbye. Goodbye, honey.
{23283}{23374}- See you at the Palace, kid.|- All right, doctor. It's a date.
{23378}{23440}- Goodbye.|- Bye.
{23613}{23685}Hiya, Springtime. Going my way?
{23689}{23775}Say, you know it's not safe|for a pretty girl to be walking around...
{23780}{23811}...by herself.
{23815}{23855}Oh, why don't you come off it?
{23860}{23923}You know you're gonna wind up|calling me pet names.
{23928}{23959}Well, of all the...
{23963}{24022}Tempo, Springtime!|Tempo, tempo!
{24027}{24116}I didn't like you at 7:00 this morning|and I don't like you now.
{24120}{24195}If you keep playing your cards right,|I'm gonna hate you.
{24200}{24286}So why don't you just evaporate,|fade away, dissolve?!
{24290}{24339}I want to talk to you about business.
{24343}{24395}- Write me a letter.|- It's too important.
{24399}{24462}Fancy face, I caught you on-stage|this afternoon.
{24466}{24551}You sing like a bird, dance like a deer,|look like a wedding ring...
{24556}{24599}...but that act you're with...
{24604}{24667}- That's two pins and a lollipop.|- What do you mean?
{24672}{24722}It's murder. That's what I mean.
{24726}{24803}Why don't you get bright?|You're too fast for that buggy.
{24807}{24869}And why don't you mind|your own business?
{24873}{24943}That's just the point.|It is my business.
{24962}{25046}Next season, I'm doing a double act,|throwing away the baggy pants.
{25050}{25123}Don't look now, Springtime.|You're gonna be my partner.
{25127}{25162}- Oh, I am, huh?|- You said it.
{25166}{25260}Standing next to me, you'll look|like a million bucks in nickels and dimes.
{25264}{25324}I can see those three-sheets:|Palmer and Hayden!
{25328}{25402}- We'll tear down theaters...|- I wouldn't be your partner...
{25406}{25477}...if they booked us into the Palace|for 51 weeks a year.
{25481}{25555}- I don't get it. Why?|- Oh, so many reasons.
{25559}{25623}But you wouldn't understand|any of them.
{25627}{25695}Gee, I feel sorry for you.
{25747}{25779}Hey, wait a minute.
{25784}{25852}Look, Miss Hayden.|I'm sorry.
{25856}{25966}Your act is all right. Oh, it needs|a little punching up here and there, but...
{25970}{26023}- Why don't you take this?|- What's that?
{26027}{26123}It's the arrangement I bought. The one|you and Metcalfe were supposed to get.
{26128}{26183}- But you were...|- No. Go ahead.
{26188}{26256}All that big talk about me|breaking down theaters...
{26260}{26341}...that's strictly small-town talk|on a cold night.
{26345}{26448}- Oh, I'm sorry. I spoke so...|- No. Forget it. You had me pegged.
{26452}{26545}I'm never gonna win any blue ribbons|for being a nice guy.
{26567}{26645}- Well, I...|- Say, would you...?
{26649}{26715}- Oh, skip it.|- What?
{26719}{26808}I was gonna ask you to have a cup|of coffee, but after the way I...
{26812}{26864}Well, I'd love to have a cup of coffee.
{26868}{26931}- You would?|- Sure.
{27118}{27199}- Two coffees, please.|- Two coffees. Yes.
{27210}{27255}How long you been in show business?
{27259}{27329}I wasn't really in it until Jimmy|gave me a chance. You?
{27333}{27402}- All my life. Do you like it?|- I love it.
{27406}{27466}I'd rather sing and dance than, well...
{27470}{27540}...eat.|- I can tell that by the way you work.
{27544}{27596}- You're good.|- No. I'm not good yet.
{27600}{27698}But I will be someday.|You know, I've got kind of a...
{27716}{27820}- You'd probably laugh at me if I told you.|- No, I wouldn't. What?
{27828}{27881}Well, I've got kind of a goal|in my mind.
{27885}{27945}It's the same goal|every vaudeville actor has...
{27949}{28003}...only I'm really going to get there.
{28021}{28084}I used to think I'd play the Palace|someday too.
{28088}{28148}- Well, maybe you will.|- Not me.
{28152}{28257}You had my number, all right.|Just a cheap tramp comic.
{28261}{28355}- Oh, I wouldn't say that.|- Why not? It's the truth.
{28360}{28435}Take that stuff, for instance.|I'm not so sure I can do it.
{28439}{28514}- Then why'd you buy it?|- I liked it.
{28518}{28573}It sure is a knockout.
{28577}{28618}- Want to hear it?|- Sure. Love to.
{28622}{28647}Okay.
{28720}{28792}If you've heard my kind of voice before,|stop me.
{28796}{28840}All right.
{29110}{29167}Wait a minute.|You better let me do it.
{29171}{29218}Okay.
{29269}{29319}Now...
{30622}{30673}Here's the church.
{30705}{30762}And here's the steeple.
{30796}{30851}Open the door...
{30877}{30936}...and there's the people.
{32894}{32940}Remember this one?
{33006}{33052}And this.
{34479}{34530}You know what I can't eat for breakfast?
{34534}{34594}Why, no. I haven't the slightest idea.
{34599}{34708}- Tell me, what can't you eat for breakfast?|- Luncheon and dinner.
{35304}{35377}Here comes that Loveland again.
{35632}{35675}Oh, yes.
{35691}{35729}Thank you.
{35733}{35785}Thank you.
{35789}{35871}- Do we click or don't we?|- That was wonderful! You were perfect!
{35875}{35971}- What a great finale for a double act!|- We'd have to get a different opening.
{35976}{36023}- A slower one.|- We come on together.
{36027}{36131}You go off for a quick change.|I do my soft-shoe routine, and then we...
{36200}{36248}What's the matter?
{36323}{36377}I guess I forgot.
{37120}{37194}- Twenty-six, please.|- Oh, yes.
{37229}{37270}Thank you.
{37364}{37439}- Well, it was fun while it lasted.|- Yeah. Here.
{37443}{37501}No. You keep it. You can do it.|You proved it.
{37505}{37559}Nope. It takes two.
{37563}{37615}- Well, please. L...|- It's yours.
{37620}{37683}Do it with Metcalfe or tear it up.
{37687}{37744}Anyway, it's yours, nobody else's.
{37748}{37799}Well, thank you.
{37818}{37885}- Good night.|- Good night.
{37972}{38016}Wait a minute.
{38058}{38127}I played a dirty trick on you.
{38143}{38200}You better know.|Then you won't feel so bad.
{38211}{38265}When I offered to give you that song...
{38269}{38363}...I really didn't mean it.|I was playing you for a sap.
{38367}{38450}I wanted to fix it so you'd give me|a chance to try out with you.
{38455}{38535}And all that sob stuff|about me being ashamed of myself...
{38540}{38627}...that was just a bid for sympathy.|I wasn't ashamed.
{38632}{38684}I thought I was being pretty cute.
{38752}{38811}I'm ashamed now though.
{38824}{38893}And this time, when I say I'm a heel...
{38907}{38987}...well, I'm not kidding.
{39132}{39191}Well, I'm glad you told me.
{39224}{39267}Good night.
{39332}{39380}Good night.
{39687}{39719}Hi.
{39723}{39803}- Well, make yourself at home.|- Thanks. I already have.
{39808}{39863}Danny get off all right?
{39870}{39934}He sure took his time about it.|I began to think...
{39938}{39979}...they were holding you ransom.
{39983}{40066}Well, I stopped in to get some coffee.
{40086}{40151}When you didn't come back,|I walked by the station.
{40155}{40219}I thought maybe I might run into you.
{40229}{40288}I saw you through a window.
{40300}{40339}I heard you too.
{40343}{40426}Gosh, you two were swell together.|Terrific!
{40431}{40479}Weren't we, Jimmy?
{40495}{40559}But those after-the-show acts,|they never hold up.
{40564}{40658}Jo. Did Harry Palmer ask you|to team up with him?
{40662}{40718}- How'd you know?|- He'd be crazy if he didn't.
{40722}{40807}I saw you together.|You're a natural for each other.
{40828}{40896}Look, Jimmy.|I'm kind of sleepy.
{40908}{40950}What...?
{40981}{41031}What did you tell him, Jo?
{41044}{41096}I told him I already had a job.
{41100}{41138}Yeah?
{41152}{41204}Well, you haven't.
{41232}{41315}- What do you mean?|- I'm breaking up the act, Jo.
{41319}{41366}Oh, no, you're not.
{41371}{41451}I'm not gonna have you making|noble sacrifices on my account.
{41455}{41573}Who said anything about your account? And|who said anything about noble sacrifices?
{41577}{41644}I'm a comic.|I should have known that before.
{41648}{41770}I don't know what I was messing up my act|with girls and music and stuff like that.
{41774}{41810}Besides...
{41814}{41901}...l've got a new idea|that I'd like to try out with Sid.
{41905}{41952}Just the two of us.
{41981}{42081}Well, what made you decide all this|tonight?
{42085}{42182}I should have thought of it long ago,|but you know me, putting things off...
{42186}{42254}You know how it's been.|The act's not doing well.
{42258}{42327}I had a wire from Eddie,|said he can't get us bookings.
{42331}{42377}Lily's talking about leaving, and...
{42381}{42448}Well, it's the only thing to do, that's all.
{42476}{42547}If I thought you were trying|to pave the way for me...
{42551}{42638}Now, wait a minute. What are you|talking about? This is business.
{42660}{42755}No fooling. I wouldn't joke|about a thing like that.
{42795}{42844}It's good business too.
{42848}{42896}For everybody.
{43135}{43201}Oh, Jimmy. You're sweet.
{43205}{43300}- You're just as sweet as they come.|- Do you want to know something?
{43304}{43375}That goes for you too, double.
{43428}{43488}I'm gonna kind of miss you, kiddo.
{43492}{43552}Working with you hasn't been|like working at all.
{43556}{43646}- It's been more like...|- Palmer and Hayden.
{43650}{43715}Gee, think of that.
{43719}{43792}Palmer and Hayden.|It's the way we're gonna bill ourselves.
{43796}{43843}- Isn't that wonderful?|- Sounds swell.
{43847}{43938}Oh, I gotta tell him now, right away.
{46848}{46948}- Don't you think you better go to bed?|- Yeah. I guess so.
{46960}{47065}- How I hate those man-traps.|- Oh, well, you take the lower tonight.
{47069}{47128}I wouldn't know how to act in one.|Hey, George.
{47132}{47193}- Whenever you're ready.|- Yes, sir.
{47249}{47295}Hey, listen to this.
{47299}{47361}"Eddie Melton has booked Jimmy Metcalfe,|comic...
{47365}{47419}...with Sid Simms|on the Orpheum circuit.
{47424}{47495}Metcalfe opens the 19th in Minneapolis."
{47500}{47604}Isn't that wonderful? Look.|See? Here.
{47680}{47763}- I'd like a crack at some Orpheum time.|- Oh, now, Harry.
{47767}{47824}Well, I'm sick of playing|these two-bit towns.
{47828}{47903}- Chicago isn't a two-bit town.|- The part we're playing is.
{47908}{47990}Why must everything happen here|and now? You think that we have...
{47995}{48046}Yes, sir. I'll make it right up for you.
{48098}{48166}- I'll take that.|- I'll go back and have a cigarette.
{48170}{48241}- Let me know when he's finished, will you?|- Yeah.
{48784}{48898}- This a private car, sir.|- Excuse me. I was looking for the club...
{48978}{49053}Oh, I'm sorry. I was just|on my way back for a cigarette.
{49057}{49167}- I must have got off at the wrong floor.|- Why don't you have your cigarette here?
{49172}{49251}- Well, thanks a lot, but I...|- Please.
{49255}{49355}- I'd like one myself.|- Well, thanks. That's mighty nice of you.
{49360}{49428}- That's all, Celeste.|- Yes, ma'am.
{49505}{49561}Oh, excuse me.
{49702}{49738}Drink?
{49743}{49847}- Sure.|- Chartreuse, creme de menthe, vieille cure?
{49852}{49884}Surprise me.
{49947}{50008}- There you are.|- Thanks.
{50020}{50103}Say, this sure beats a club car, all right.
{50120}{50190}And better-looking people too.
{50408}{50474}Say! You're not...?
{50494}{50579}Well, I'll be darned. Imagine me,|sitting here with Eve Minard!
{50584}{50626}Say, you're not really...?
{50639}{50752}How do you like that? Guess you|never heard of me. Harry Palmer.
{50760}{50831}- Harry Palmer?|- Of Palmer and Hayden.
{50835}{50919}Oh, yes, certainly.|A fellow artist.
{50932}{50984}Nothing less. Get a load of this.
{51312}{51356}- Very nice.|- You get the rough idea.
{51360}{51427}- I must come and see you.|- I open in Chicago tomorrow.
{51432}{51506}- A full week too.|- Really? I open there tomorrow.
{51510}{51569}- At the Majestic?|- Well, no.
{51573}{51631}They booked me into|a smaller house this time.
{51635}{51709}- It's a good one though, for its size.|- Oh, that's fine.
{51713}{51788}Chicago seems to be much|more inviting now.
{51792}{51920}Well, the pleasure's all mine. If you want|to see the town, I'm your man.
{51924}{52024}Chicago, Boston, Detroit,|they're all the same. Except New York.
{52028}{52116}- That is a city.|- I suppose you've played the Palace.
{52120}{52180}Palace? Which one?
{52194}{52281}Which one?|Oh, there's only one real Palace.
{52285}{52363}- New York.|- Oh, yes. Yes, I've played there.
{52367}{52428}And I have a return engagement|before I sail.
{52432}{52471}Do you like to play there?
{52516}{52597}Yes. I like to play there very much.
{52690}{52760}- More?|- Sure. Why not?
{52784}{52845}Come to think about it,|I never caught your act.
{52849}{52914}- No?|- I know that you sing and all that...
{52918}{52967}...but what kind of stuff?|- Many kinds.
{52972}{53076}- Rags or ballads?|- As you like. I have it!
{53081}{53159}You danced for me,|I will sing for you, if I may.
{53164}{53222}- That'd be great.|- What will you like to hear?
{53226}{53310}Don't make it too highbrow.|You gotta gauge your audience.
{53314}{53416}- Give them something they'll understand.|- I think you'll understand this.
{53420}{53468}Most people do.
{55764}{55823}- Say, that's wonderful!|- You like that?
{55828}{55890}Do I? It's terrific!|Let's have an encore.
{55894}{55980}- Lf you wish.|- Certainly, I wish.
{58131}{58223}- Oh, hello, Jo. How do you feel?|- How do you feel?
{58229}{58285}Here's the other half of my act,|Miss Hayden.
{58289}{58347}- Won't you come in?|- Jo, this is...
{58351}{58444}Yes. Miss Minard.|I play your records over and over again.
{58448}{58488}- I love them.|- Thank you.
{58492}{58556}Well, I was just about|to come on back and turn in.
{58560}{58637}- Thanks for the song. It was swell.|- I hope you won't forget.
{58641}{58713}- I'll be at the Majestic.|- Forget?
{58735}{58799}- Well, good night.|- Good night.
{58803}{58871}- Good night.|- Good night.
{58922}{58990}- Quite a dame, isn't she?|- Yes, she is.
{58994}{59071}Four grand a week. Oh, boy.
{59084}{59201}- Well, good night, kid.|- Good night, Harry.
{59859}{59901}- Come in.|- Ladies and gentlemen...
{59905}{59995}...I now give you Jimmy Metcalfe!|- Jimmy, darling!
{59999}{60086}How are you, Jo? Let me look at you.|My golly, you look swell!
{60090}{60189}- You're supposed to be in Minneapolis.|- We closed last night. A mild sensation.
{60193}{60262}- How is your act?|- Oh, fine.
{60266}{60342}Come on. Sit here, Jimmy.|Gee, it's good to see you.
{60346}{60426}Well, it's good to see you...|Say, who's this, General Pershing?
{60431}{60487}No. That's Danny.|He's enlisted.
{60491}{60537}No! What about the medical career?
{60541}{60614}- He's going back after the war.|- Doesn't he look swell?
{60618}{60648}- Yeah.|- Where's Harry?
{60652}{60688}Harry?
{60721}{60785}He's out with a friend.
{60797}{60851}You'll never guess who either.
{60861}{60932}- Eve Minard.|- Eve Minard!
{60936}{61007}Say, he's traveling|in pretty fast company, isn't he?
{61011}{61079}Yeah. Well...
{61083}{61130}...you know Harry.
{61151}{61199}She's a big success...
{61203}{61255}...and she's pretty...
{61259}{61300}...and, well...
{61304}{61391}Jo, you're in love|with that guy, aren't you?
{61401}{61493}Harry? Oh, no.
{61520}{61613}- I'm not in love.|- Hey, hey, shorty.
{61636}{61768}Remember me? Jimmy Metcalfe, the fella|that played Clifton Junction with you?
{61784}{61829}Oh, Jimmy.
{61855}{61930}It's way down deep inside of me.
{61943}{62062}He's wrong, and I love him.|He's right, and I love him.
{62087}{62131}It's no good.
{62186}{62276}Gee, what do you do|when you love somebody so much...
{62289}{62351}...and they don't|even know you're around?
{62399}{62446}I don't know, Jo.
{62467}{62539}I guess you just|keep right on loving them.
{62715}{62751}Watch your step.
{62970}{63037}I forgot to ask you.|When do you open in St. Paul?
{63041}{63104}- St. Paul?|- Say, Jo.
{63108}{63167}- Well, hello, stranger.|- Hi, Harry.
{63171}{63227}- I hear you're doing all right.|- Not so bad.
{63231}{63302}- Like to see a fella get ahead.|- You've got a few minutes.
{63306}{63375}You better go on first|and give me a chance to change.
{63379}{63434}All right. But hurry, please.
{63509}{63589}Jo. How about having supper with me|after the show tonight?
{63593}{63688}Fine. We have to catch a train at midnight.|We open tomorrow in Milwaukee.
{63692}{63758}- Do you suppose he'd like to come?|- I'll ask him.
{63762}{63811}- I'll see you later.|- All right, Jimmy.
{63815}{63884}Make it good, shorty.|I'll be out front watching you.
{64080}{64173}Harry? Jimmy wants to know if we|can have supper later. Can you make it?
{64177}{64242}I'd like to,|but I got a date with Eve.
{64267}{64355}Oh, well, you better hurry|or you'll miss your cue.
{67688}{67757}- That will be all, Celeste.|- Yes, ma'am.
{68345}{68384}Miss Minard.
{68388}{68447}- Oh, hello.|- Hello.
{68451}{68548}- Could I see you a moment, please?|- I'm sorry, but I...
{68575}{68610}I expect a guest.
{68636}{68735}Yes, I know, but this will|only take a moment. Please.
{69025}{69079}Well, what is it, my dear?
{69115}{69184}Well, I wanted to talk to you...
{69242}{69275}Yes?
{69327}{69371}I thought...
{69439}{69486}I'm sorry.
{69520}{69611}- Lf you'll excuse me.|- Wait a moment.
{69627}{69732}I know you have something to say,|and I would like to hear it.
{69746}{69787}What is it?
{69801}{69850}Sit down, please.
{69912}{70056}I had my speech all memorized, and it|was gonna be pretty dramatic, I guess.
{70099}{70151}But I got stage fright.
{70207}{70244}It's about Harry.
{70286}{70354}You see, I love him.
{70396}{70481}And you're such a big person,|that I thought...
{70507}{70584}Well, it's hard to say, but...
{70588}{70620}...I love him.
{70655}{70702}And you're worried about me?
{70733}{70813}No. It's not that.
{70817}{70891}- But...|- You needn't worry, my dear.
{70906}{70951}I have no designs on him.
{71043}{71074}Thank you.
{71102}{71191}- I hope you don't think that I just...|- Don't apologize, Miss Hayden.
{71205}{71359}I loved someone like you love Harry, and I|didn't realize it until a long time afterwards.
{71363}{71410}Much too long.
{71419}{71487}But I should have done|what you're doing now.
{71516}{71559}Thank you.
{71609}{71718}- But I'm sorry you love him so much.|- Why?
{71722}{71811}- Because he isn't worth it.|- Oh, no, you're wrong. He's...
{71815}{71880}- He's...|- He's an opportunist...
{71884}{71995}...an egotistical actor who|will do anything to get what he wants.
{71999}{72075}He'll make you very unhappy|one day, my dear.
{72079}{72163}Oh, no, you're wrong.|Harry isn't bad.
{72167}{72242}I know because|I'm closer to him than anyone.
{72246}{72320}- I know.|- You know.
{72336}{72414}He'd leave you in a minute|if I made him an offer.
{72435}{72542}- Oh, I don't believe that.|- Would you like to have me try?
{72563}{72625}Oh, no, I don't believe that.
{72711}{72794}It might be better to get hurt|all at once and get it over with.
{72799}{72870}- I'm not afraid.|- Shall I ask him?
{72875}{72918}Well, I...
{72922}{72994}You can get to the elevator this way.
{73051}{73151}- I am afraid.|- Go on. Quickly!
{73403}{73497}- Hello, Eve. Here's Adam.|- Good evening, Harry.
{73683}{73790}- Say, what are we celebrating?|- Harry, I have a surprise for you.
{73794}{73902}- Well, come on. Let's have it.|- How would you like to join my act?
{73946}{74030}- What?|- How would you like to join my act?
{74035}{74132}- Come on, Eve. You're giving it to me.|- No, no. I'm very serious.
{74169}{74206}You are?
{74225}{74306}You're asking if I want to tour with you|and play the Palace?
{74310}{74342}Yes.
{74364}{74410}Holy...
{74453}{74538}Hallelujah! Wait till I tell Jo!
{74558}{74590}Jo.
{74595}{74640}You want her to go too, don't you?
{74654}{74809}Well, she's probably very talented,|but, after all, I'm a singer myself.
{74917}{75011}Oh, well,|that's a different proposition.
{75071}{75140}- Gee, I...|- Well, then let's forget about it.
{75148}{75227}Hey, wait a minute.|Who said anything about forgetting?
{75231}{75282}You don't know Jo.
{75298}{75414}She's the top of the deck. She wouldn't|stand in my way. She's a trouper.
{75435}{75479}When do we start?
{75491}{75580}- Tomorrow.|- Tomorrow?
{75685}{75804}Well, what's holding us up?|Come on. Let's have a drink on it.
{75903}{76001}Here's to Harry Palmer,|heading for the Palace.
{76057}{76116}- Harry.|- Yeah?
{76120}{76190}When you see Miss Hayden,|tell her something for me.
{76194}{76232}Sure.
{76261}{76305}Tell her...
{76338}{76385}...l'm sorry.
{76719}{76758}Come in.
{76772}{76812}- Hello.|- Hello.
{76816}{76891}- You packed?|- No.
{76895}{76994}- Train leaves at 12:30, you know.|- Yeah, I know.
{76999}{77062}Look at this.|Looks like the rats have been at it.
{77067}{77120}You'd think that in a city like Chicago...
{77124}{77219}...they'd know how to launder a blouse.|- Yeah.
{77264}{77307}Say, Jo.
{77355}{77417}I want to ask you sort of a question.
{77457}{77515}Supposing somebody had been offered|a chance...
{77520}{77598}...to do something they'd been wanting|to do for a long time.
{77635}{77670}Yeah?
{77692}{77816}Well, supposing their accepting this offer|meant hurting somebody else maybe.
{77986}{78052}Well, what would you do?
{78098}{78146}Oh, I don't know.
{78173}{78272}I guess it would depend on how important|the thing was to me.
{78314}{78385}And if it was really important...
{78444}{78505}...I guess I'd go ahead and do it.
{78581}{78650}- You would?|- Sure.
{78654}{78757}- You only live once, you know.|- Yeah, I know...
{78761}{78837}...but it's kind of hard making|up your mind.
{79043}{79122}It's funny, you bringing up|a question like that.
{79163}{79228}I've got kind of the same problem.
{79247}{79356}- And it is hard too.|- What do you mean?
{79379}{79437}- Harry...|- Yeah?
{79466}{79538}...Jimmy wants me|to come back in his act.
{79543}{79582}Yeah?
{79632}{79685}Do you want to go back to him?
{79712}{79776}Well, I don't know. I...
{79780}{79842}He made me|a pretty good offer.
{79881}{79967}Well, after all, we...
{79971}{80045}We all want to get ahead,|you know?
{80049}{80174}- I mean, that's only human.|- Well, look, Jo.
{80194}{80303}I don't want to stand in your way.|If you want to go, go ahead and go.
{80313}{80401}- Honest?|- Sure. Go right ahead.
{80443}{80521}You're not just trying to be nice,|are you?
{80525}{80616}No, of course not!|Look, there's no use kidding ourselves.
{80620}{80700}We both know things haven't panned out|as well as we thought.
{80704}{80782}So if you can get a break,|go ahead, take it.
{80848}{80967}Oh, come on, Springtime.|No hearts and flowers. Not from you.
{80971}{81063}- Look, we're both gonna be on top.|- Sure.
{81079}{81130}Good luck, Jo...
{81134}{81177}...and lots of it.
{81223}{81287}Hey, what's the big idea?
{81305}{81394}Say, you're not crying|because you feel sorry for me, are you?
{81407}{81514}There's no need to do that because tonight|I was over at Eve's, and she asked...
{81551}{81627}Oh, Jo, please don't cry.
{81631}{81718}- Please. I'm not worth it, I tell you.|- I can't help it.
{81723}{81786}Honey, I wish you'd stop.
{81790}{81858}Oh, please, darling, please.
{81907}{81998}- Harry, Harry.|- Oh, honey.
{82353}{82426}Say, what hit us?
{82463}{82524}Oh, it hit me a long time ago.
{82579}{82634}Well, I'll be darned.
{82728}{82796}- Harry.|- Yeah.
{82811}{82900}What was it Eve asked you to do tonight?
{82937}{82998}Oh, forget it.
{83023}{83122}We gotta get going! We gotta make|that train, and you gotta help me pack!
{83132}{83210}The nerve of that Metcalfe,|trying to break up my act...
{83214}{83311}...and trying to steal my girl too.|I'll push his face in.
{83315}{83404}The time I've wasted. Why didn't you|tell me I was in love with you?
{83408}{83474}I didn't know,|and I can hardly believe it now.
{83478}{83544}I'll make you believe it, all right.
{83599}{83647}Hey, what's this?
{83794}{83887}Look! "Palmer and Hayden|booked into Palace New York...
{83891}{83956}...first week in September.|Congratulations, Eddie."
{83960}{84019}- Harry!|- Is this our lucky day, or isn't it?
{84023}{84122}First we fall in love, and now this!|We're on the big time, baby.
{84127}{84194}We're on the big time.|We're gonna play the Palace!
{84198}{84262}- The Palace!|- It would have been wonderful anyway...
{84267}{84331}...but now it's even more wonderful!
{84378}{84410}Oh, Harry, look out!
{84414}{84467}Know what we'll do|after the first matinee?
{84471}{84522}- Have dinner?|- We're gonna get married.
{84527}{84594}Married. Harry!
{84696}{84742}Oh, darling!
{85238}{85367}- Well, here you are at last.|- Take a look at it. Amateur night is over.
{85566}{85615}Take the elevator|to your dressing room.
{85619}{85657}- Thank you very much.|- Jimmy!
{85661}{85700}- Hey, Jo!|- Hello!
{85704}{85773}- Well, I'll be two ifs and a but.|- Hello!
{85777}{85843}- Glad to see you!|- Are you opening here today too?
{85847}{85902}- What do you mean, "too"?|- What do you know?
{85906}{85969}After all this time,|we're all playing the Palace.
{85973}{86037}- I hope you have to follow us on!|- Listen to him.
{86041}{86097}We'd better get|our dressing room key.
{86101}{86135}Palmer and Hayden, please.
{86139}{86235}And after the matinee,|we'll just be using one dressing room.
{86293}{86378}Say, you don't mean to tell me|you're gonna marry this lug?
{86384}{86463}- Well, only for 150 years or so.|- What do you know?
{86467}{86554}Open at the Palace, and close|at the little church around the corner.
{86558}{86650}My gosh, Harry, that's swell.|And I hope you're a hit in both places.
{86654}{86705}Thanks, Jimmy.
{86709}{86798}- Isn't anybody gonna give a party?|- Sure, somebody's gonna give a...
{86802}{86854}I'm gonna give a party after the show.
{86858}{86981}- Wonderful! Danny will be in from camp too.|- There's no Palmer and Hayden here.
{86985}{87025}- What?|- I don't see the name.
{87029}{87077}It's gotta be, we open this afternoon.
{87081}{87185}Well, it is not on my list...|Oh, Mr. Waring?
{87202}{87266}- He won't give us our keys.|- We're Palmer and Hayden.
{87271}{87329}Palmer and Hayden?|You're not booked in here.
{87333}{87414}- We're not booked?|- There must be some mistake.
{87438}{87491}- Well, so here we are.|- Eddie.
{87495}{87574}Hello, Harry. Hello, Jo.|Say, you must have got in early.
{87578}{87625}What do you think of our big boy?
{87629}{87708}You wired us we were to play here,|and they never heard of us.
{87712}{87813}- I wired you what?|- Go on, show it to him.
{87821}{87851}Here.
{87881}{87958}This says "Palmer and Hayden booked|into the Palace New York."
{87963}{88026}- I know it does.|- Would I say the Palace New York?
{88030}{88110}Would anybody except a stenographer|who wasn't paying attention?
{88114}{88182}- What do you mean?|- Well, there's only one Palace.
{88186}{88238}Nobody has to tell you where that is.
{88256}{88292}You meant...
{88340}{88446}- You meant some other Palace?|- Certainly. I said it. The girl got it wrong.
{88450}{88558}It's the Palace over in Newark.|You open there Wednesday for a split week.
{88834}{88878}A split week.
{88899}{88938}In Newark.
{89039}{89072}It's all right.
{89076}{89167}Why did you say "congratulations,"|"great opportunity," and build it up?
{89171}{89239}Because it is a great opportunity.|Newark's so close.
{89243}{89326}These circuits send scouts.|One might catch your act and like it.
{89330}{89399}Yeah, yeah, yeah.|It's a great chance.
{89403}{89450}Don't give me that.
{89584}{89640}Gee, I'm sorry, kiddo.
{89753}{89796}Gee.
{89800}{89835}Gee, Jo.
{89896}{90010}Maybe you should have stayed with him.|You could be going up in that elevator too.
{90033}{90105}I'd rather stay|on the ground floor.
{90184}{90288}Well, they still got us booked|at the little church around the corner.
{90306}{90361}Still want to?
{90365}{90423}We gotta open somewhere.
{90539}{90576}Harry...
{90600}{90718}I'll marry you now.|I'll marry you anytime you say, but...
{90722}{90848}...we always agreed that we'd get married|after our first matinee at the Palace.
{90852}{90911}Let's keep it that way, huh?
{92314}{92376}She said, "Where'd you|ride horses this summer?"
{92380}{92463}I said, "The same place|I did my ice skating last winter."
{92514}{92578}Well, fellas, here's to...
{92607}{92679}Well, here's to...
{92692}{92739}Here's to.
{92790}{92829}Say, I wonder where Danny is.
{92833}{92914}I don't know. He was supposed|to be here a long time ago.
{92946}{93003}Here he is now!|Hiya, Danny.
{93025}{93064}You know everybody, don't you?
{93068}{93150}- What kept you so long?|- Why, we got our sailing orders.
{93154}{93221}- When do you have to go?|- Right away.
{93266}{93386}- Right away?|- Yeah, I just got time to say goodbye.
{93406}{93470}Well, I guess I'm holding up the Army.
{93498}{93525}So long, Danny.
{93529}{93578}- Good luck to you, kid.|- Thanks.
{93582}{93639}- Bye, corporal.|- Bye, Sid. Goodbye.
{93830}{93899}- Take care of yourself, soldier.|- Yeah.
{93914}{93998}I sure wish I could postpone|the war long enough...
{94002}{94053}...to hear you sing again.
{94071}{94104}Well...
{94108}{94174}- So long, everybody.|- So long, Danny.
{95363}{95426}See you at the Palace, kid.
{95431}{95476}It's a date...
{95480}{95528}...doctor.
{95623}{95750}Till we meet
{95813}{95867}Again
{96850}{96906}- Boy, is he hokey.|- But they like it.
{97223}{97270}They're yours.|What's left of them.
{97274}{97343}- Come on, let's show them.|- You bet we'll show them.
{101155}{101204}- Guys, I'm tired...|- Hey, you were great!
{101208}{101284}Yeah, in Newark. Where are the scouts|you said were coming?
{101288}{101359}- Well, here's one.|- Hey, were you out front?
{101363}{101415}You wanted the Palace.|Now you've got it.
{101419}{101487}The Palace, New York.|Keep it straight this time.
{101491}{101561}- Hey, you mean it?|- Your audience out there meant it.
{101565}{101595}Oh, boy!
{101599}{101655}If they cheer in Newark,|you can phone it in.
{101659}{101716}- Second week in October?|- Over a month away!
{101720}{101769}- I won't be able to sleep!|- All right?
{101773}{101836}- You bet it is!|- Bert, about the kids' salary...
{101840}{101911}I never discuss details|in front of the artists.
{101915}{101974}- Goodbye.|- Goodbye. And thanks.
{101991}{102078}- It's here, honey. This time it's the McCoy.|- Yes, darling!
{102125}{102164}Say...
{102168}{102230}Wasn't there some kind of talk|about a wedding?
{102235}{102312}Stupid, why do you think I've been|anxious to make the Palace?
{102316}{102382}- Get dressed. We gotta celebrate.|- All right.
{102395}{102446}You can celebrate in Newark,|can't you?
{102451}{102518}I could lead a parade|in a telephone booth.
{102522}{102570}A month is a chance|to polish the act.
{102575}{102618}- Right.|- We can dig up a new song.
{102622}{102684}Yeah. What kind of a song, Harry?
{102701}{102752}Harry, what kind of a song?
{102773}{102813}Honey, what kind of...?
{102886}{102934}What's the matter?
{103176}{103230}You've been drafted.
{103235}{103281}Not yet, I'm not.
{103307}{103384}- Well, Harry, it says...|- I don't care what it says there!
{103419}{103498}Think anything's gonna stand in the way|of playing the Palace?
{103502}{103565}Oh, no. Not even a war!
{103723}{103785}I know how you feel.
{103789}{103843}After all the plans we'd had.
{103919}{103997}- What can you do?|- Plenty.
{104027}{104075}I can do plenty!
{104079}{104111}I'll beat this.
{104596}{104664}There must be somebody else|you can try.
{104668}{104719}Look, do you want|us both in jail?
{104723}{104805}I got two postponements.|Nothing I can do about the one tomorrow.
{104809}{104862}You have to take|your physical examination.
{104867}{104962}- But we open Monday.|- Now, look, I've done all I can do.
{104966}{105026}I got you the Palace.|I ain't booking the war!
{105031}{105056}Goodbye!
{105265}{105330}- Well?|- Nothing.
{105334}{105394}He says he can't do|anything about it.
{105645}{105700}I guess I'll write a letter to Danny.
{105704}{105770}Oh, yeah. Go ahead.|I'll see you later.
{105774}{105807}All right.
{106893}{106939}Harry, could I use your pen?
{106943}{106991}- What's the matter?|- Nothing.
{106995}{107034}- Nothing.|- There is something.
{107039}{107107}Well, what if there is?|Nagging me won't help!
{107111}{107191}Kid, I wanna be alone.|Why don't you go back to your room?
{107195}{107248}I gotta think by myself.
{107272}{107373}- All right.|- Jo. Look, baby, I didn't mean it.
{107377}{107440}I've got the jitters, that's all.|I'm sorry.
{107444}{107498}It's all right. I understand.
{108859}{108912}- Just take a chair, please.|- Yes, ma'am.
{108967}{109007}Temporary physical disability.
{109011}{109078}He's to return in six weeks|for final classification.
{109082}{109119}Very well, doctor.
{109262}{109294}Next.
{109342}{109416}Come on, Jo! Say something.|Tell me, how do I look?
{109420}{109494}Very brave, Mr. Metcalfe.|Very brave.
{109530}{109575}- Finish this for me.|- Who's ahead?
{109579}{109640}If I don't start cheating,|I'll never get even.
{109644}{109687}- Telegram, Ms. Hayden.|- Thank you.
{109708}{109806}You don't have to cheat if you see|the moves. You missed one right here.
{110181}{110211}Hey, Jo, what is it?
{110279}{110318}What's wrong?
{110342}{110373}It's...
{110408}{110491}- It's Danny.|- Danny?
{110545}{110598}Oh, Jo.
{110620}{110670}My brother.
{110689}{110784}Relax, baby, the Palace is okay!|We're gonna kill them.
{110788}{110831}What's the matter, Jimmy?
{110835}{110866}Danny.
{110870}{110920}- Oh, not Danny.|- He's gone.
{110924}{110969}There, there, now.
{111031}{111098}Oh, darling, if I could|only make it easier for you.
{111102}{111170}You don't rate a rotten break like this.
{111277}{111350}He could have been|such a great doctor.
{111373}{111409}Great doctor.
{111442}{111506}But Danny wouldn't|want you to cry.
{111510}{111608}If he could speak to you now,|he'd tell you he was happy.
{111615}{111688}Remember, Jo,|Danny did what he wanted to do.
{111807}{111856}Harry.
{111860}{111895}What happened to your hand?
{111902}{111967}It's nothing. An accident.|I caught it in my trunk.
{111971}{112052}Don't worry, baby.|It won't keep us from playing the Palace.
{112213}{112253}It was an accident.
{112343}{112404}Jo, don't you believe me?
{112434}{112523}All right then, I did do it!|But I only did it for us.
{112551}{112598}Well, you believe that, don't you?
{112674}{112759}Oh, I feel sorry for you.
{112786}{112858}Terribly, desperately sorry.
{112863}{112910}Jo, if you'd only listen to me.
{112915}{112972}You're always acting.
{113006}{113090}But you'll never make|the big time.
{113104}{113179}Because you're small-time|in your heart.
{113299}{113370}There's only one thing|you can do for me.
{113423}{113479}Leave me alone.
{113536}{113635}I never want to see you again,|as long as I live.
{113719}{113762}Never.
{114566}{114611}But it's just stiff, that's all.
{114615}{114649}No.
{114653}{114711}It's crippled permanently.
{114715}{114775}You mean they won't take me?
{114782}{114814}Couldn't I enlist?
{114819}{114887}No, the Army won't take you.|The tendons are severed.
{114897}{114962}- It won't bother you much...|- They've gotta take me.
{114967}{115014}- You can do something.|- I'm afraid not.
{115019}{115063}Then send me to some specialist.
{115067}{115131}Doc, I gotta get it fixed.|I gotta get in the Army!
{115135}{115203}I'm sorry. There's nothing|anybody can do to help you.
{115207}{115246}Next.
{115341}{115381}Sit down.
{116892}{116975}- Hello, Harry. How are you?|- Eddie, where's Jo?
{116988}{117065}You have to tell me. Where is she?|I have to see her.
{117087}{117191}I'm going out of my mind. People cross|the street like I'm a house on fire.
{117195}{117274}Do something. Call someone.|Say I didn't know what I was doing.
{117278}{117333}Tell them I don't care|about the Palace.
{117337}{117407}Tell them I hope|it burns to the ground.
{117426}{117507}Eddie, listen, you're my friend.|You can't shut me out.
{117521}{117593}All right, I made a mistake.|I did the wrong thing.
{117597}{117656}All right, I did the worst thing|in the world.
{117660}{117705}But I know I did it.
{117719}{117815}Eddie, somebody's gotta believe me.|I wasn't trying to duck the draft.
{117843}{117918}I wanted a postponement|so Jo and I could play the Palace...
{117922}{117998}...and get married after the first matinee,|like we planned.
{118002}{118042}That's all I wanted.
{118056}{118158}Eddie, look at my hand!|You don't think I wanted that, do you?
{118317}{118416}They can't shut me out.|I owe those guys that are fighting.
{118484}{118519}Eddie.
{118523}{118558}What am I gonna do?
{118562}{118623}I don't know, kid. It's your package.
{118627}{118682}You bought it and wrapped it up.
{118715}{118777}Guess you'll just have|to untie it yourself.
{119739}{119802}- Who will be the first to buy a bond?|- I will!
{119806}{119861}- So will we!|- That's it. Step to the table.
{119865}{119918}Who wants a share of the future|of America?
{119923}{119966}Come on, folks.
{119970}{120058}Everybody can help over there.|The nicest part of being an American.
{120062}{120130}Folks, put your hands in your pockets|and be a hero.
{120134}{120179}Can I have somebody...?
{120183}{120236}Hey, Harry. How are you?
{120240}{120292}Hello, Sid. What are you doing?
{120296}{120350}Y.M.C.A.|Going to France in two weeks.
{120354}{120414}- I thought you were drafted.|- I was, but...
{120418}{120508}Got my physical exam. They said|they'd take me after women and children.
{120512}{120544}Say, Harry...
{120575}{120624}Why don't you join up|and come with us?
{120628}{120736}I'm not going over there to sing|while guys are getting their heads shot off.
{120740}{120807}- Funny, that's not the way I look at it.|- Well, I do.
{120811}{120920}You're a good performer. Those fellas|could use a song and dance, and you...
{120960}{121023}I just thought maybe you|want to go over there.
{121047}{121090}See you around|the stage door.
{121727}{121780}Come on, fellas. Everybody out.
{121788}{121842}Pile out. Pile out there.
{121886}{121919}Quiet, quiet, quiet.
{121923}{121983}We don't wanna spend our last day|on leave here.
{121987}{122037}- I wanna go to one of them...|- Not today.
{122041}{122092}- I got drinking to do.|- I'll take charge.
{122096}{122194}Fall in, everybody.|Attention! Right face!
{122198}{122229}Forward...
{122239}{122270}What?
{122294}{122352}C'est la guerre, old boy.
{122356}{122396}Oh, I see.
{122415}{122474}- Money.|- Oh, money. That's what you want.
{122478}{122582}- Johnny, got any of that special money left?|- Yes, sir. I'm loaded.
{122586}{122618}There you are, my friend.
{122687}{122755}Ah, that's fine.|There you go.
{122817}{122871}Wait a minute.|What about my change?
{123086}{123135}That goes for you too.
{123139}{123184}All right, everybody. Fall in.
{123211}{123263}Attention! Right face!
{123267}{123312}Forward march!
{123467}{123547}Detail, halt. Left face.|Fall out.
{126206}{126236}Jimmy!
{126240}{126309}Come and let me put my arms|around the Palace Theatre!
{126313}{126348}How are you, baby?
{126352}{126459}- There are a lot of strangers in the world.|- My golly, let me look at you.
{126463}{126507}- You look sensational!|- Thank you.
{126511}{126594}How about we step out on the town|and show these Frenchmen...
{126599}{126637}...what you can do in Paris?
{126641}{126699}Okay, but I got a number to do.|Will you wait?
{126703}{126750}Sure, I'll wait.|You know something?
{126755}{126826}We're a cinch to win this war|now that you're here.
{126830}{126863}I'll only be a minute.
{126867}{126940}- You sure you don't mind waiting?|- You know me, Jo.
{126944}{126994}I'm a good waiter.
{127140}{127173}Hey!
{127177}{127208}Harry!
{127212}{127276}- Jimmy!|- How are you, kid?
{127280}{127355}Gee, I didn't expect to see you.
{127363}{127441}- How long you been over here?|- I just landed a few hours ago.
{127445}{127483}What do you know about that?
{127487}{127562}It's good to see you, Harry.|How's it going?
{127621}{127653}Not good.
{127676}{127745}I thought it'd be better over here, but...
{127768}{127817}...it's not.
{127821}{127870}It's not better.
{127875}{127928}Well, what's the trouble, kid?
{128067}{128146}I'm in the right Army,|but I got the wrong suit on.
{128343}{128423}You got the right suit,|and the right fella's wearing it.
{128427}{128492}- Lf you're gonna...|- I wanna tell you something.
{128496}{128558}Know what's the matter?|You walk around with...
{128563}{128652}...a picture-book villain in your pocket.|You look at it like a mirror.
{128656}{128698}- Look, Jimmy...|- Cigarette?
{128815}{128884}Here's something else|you can put in your book, Harry.
{128888}{128966}Here, there aren't any heroes|and there aren't any cowards.
{128970}{129080}Believe me. I've been to the place.|I've seen them.
{129084}{129122}- Jimmy...|- Light?
{129228}{129294}They're all just regular guys.
{129299}{129366}And they all love someone.
{129370}{129443}That's what makes them|do good things or bad things.
{129447}{129533}You did something because you thought|it was the right thing to do.
{129537}{129595}And you had two good reasons|for doing it:
{129599}{129714}You wanted to get someplace that meant|more to you than anything in the world...
{129719}{129786}...and because you loved someone|an awful lot.
{129801}{129873}And those are two|pretty good reasons, Harry.
{129884}{129926}Especially the last one.
{130185}{130225}Thanks, actor.
{130255}{130303}- Can I buy you a drink?|- Can you?
{130307}{130358}You can buy me the biggest drink...
{130363}{130456}Say, I just happened to think.|I got a date to meet a fella.
{130460}{130526}Tell you what.|Sit in that chair and wait for me.
{130531}{130588}Wait here.|I won't be gone 10 minutes.
{130592}{130630}Okay.
{130645}{130742}Here I come, Jimmy.|All signed, sealed and deliv...
{130828}{130872}Harry.
{130899}{130967}- What are you...?|- Jo.
{131075}{131108}Gosh.
{131128}{131178}I never expected...
{131207}{131250}Jo.
{131293}{131394}I certainly am surprised to see you.|For a minute, I thought...
{131399}{131470}Jo, don't talk. Just stand there.
{131613}{131676}Okay. I've got it.
{131781}{131858}How have you been, Harry?|How's everything in New York?
{131871}{131915}It's a funny thing. The other day, I was...
{131923}{131952}Jo.
{131995}{132070}You don't have to skip rope for me.
{132075}{132147}I know the boat has sailed|as far as we're concerned.
{132151}{132264}And I'm not gonna tell you|the bells are ringing for me and my gal.
{132268}{132378}I know I'm not a great guy|in a lot of people's books, but...
{132388}{132454}...I don't care|about a lot of people.
{132493}{132535}Jo...
{132539}{132590}...you're looking the other way.
{132663}{132719}Coming over in the boat,|I took an inventory.
{132723}{132773}And you know something?
{132777}{132883}Right up to this minute,|my only claim to fame:
{132920}{132976}You were once my girl.
{133007}{133047}Jo.
{133074}{133118}You have to tell me...
{133123}{133204}...not a million other people,|but you, have to tell me...
{133249}{133302}...that I'm not a coward...
{133323}{133389}...and that you don't hate me.
{133426}{133495}That's the medal I want to win|in this war.
{133561}{133624}You're not a coward, Harry.
{133628}{133676}And you know that...
{133733}{133791}That I'd never hate you.
{133843}{133880}Thanks, Jo.
{133931}{133982}Thanks an awful lot.
{134018}{134089}And I'll take good care|of that medal.
{139367}{139407}It's still raining.
{139411}{139480}Let me know when it stops!
{139564}{139654}- Cheerful little bin.|- I'd like to settle down here after the war.
{139658}{139767}- Nurse, here are the men for the stretchers.|- I didn't think we looked that bad.
{139771}{139869}Get those stretchers. There are eight|wounded, got to be moved immediately.
{139873}{139938}Get them into your ambulance!|Get them out of here.
{139943}{140030}Ambulance? I'm sorry, sir.|We came here to do a show.

{140295}{140367}Eight more ambulances are on the way.
{140371}{140444}What? You better go back|and tell them to stop.

{140527}{140586}- I can't...|- Do as I say! You, give him a hand.

{141971}{142019}I can't believe he'd run out.
{142081}{142127}I wish I was with him.

NARRATOR: That little city tucked quietly against the mountains...
...is Santa Barbara, California.
Over 40,000 people live there.
When 40,000 people get together somewhere, something must be happening.
Let's take a look.
This is Main Street. Only in Santa Barbara, it's called State Street.
The people here are the same as people anywhere.
Old people, young people.
For the most part, nice people.
And speaking of nice people, this is Pop Scully's soda fountain.
Meeting place of the world, Pop calls it.
Everybody loves Pop and everybody goes there.
That is, everybody except Mr. Pringle.
He's too busy.
He's owner of the local radio station, sponsor of the community theater...
...president of the bank and he plays golf.
So Mr. Pringle doesn't get home very often.
Too bad too, it's a beautiful home.
Mr. Foster is a busy man too.
He owns and operates a fish cannery on the coast.
But he's never too busy that he can't find time for his family.
Mr. Fosters' home isn't quite as beautiful as Mr. Pringle's, but he thinks it is.
And he gets home often.
Just around the corner is the high school.
There's always something going on here...
...especially when Judy Foster and her friends are around.
Let's go in.
Now, just a minute, you can't do that to us.
We'd like to come in.
That's better. Thank you very much.
WOMAN [SINGING]:
It's a most unusual day
Feel like throwing my worries away
As an old native-born
Californian would say
It's a most unusual day
There's a most unusual sky
Not a sign of a cloud passing by
And if I want to sing
Throw my heart in the ring
It's a most unusual day
There are people meeting people
There is sunshine everywhere
There are people greeting people
And a feeling of spring in the air
It's a most unusual time
I keep feeling my temperature climb
If my heart won't behave
In the usual way
There is only one thing to say
It's a most unusual
Most unusual
Most unusual day
Gee, that was nice, Judy.
Thanks, Oogie. What do you think, Carol?
Well, it's a very cute little swing number, Judy...
...but frankly, I think it's a bit juvenile for a senior high school dance.
Judy. Why do you ask her for anyway?
You know my sister never approves of anything.
Please be quiet. Carol is talking.
Yes, go on, Carol.
Hey, now, wait a minute.
Who's directing this, anyway?
- Carol is, of course.
- Well, naturally.
Women.
Try singing the number slower, Judy.
More seductively.
And a scarf might give you something to do with your hands.
Like this, follow me.
[SINGING]
It's a most
Unusual day
Feel like throwing
My worries away
As an old native-born
Californian would say
It's a most
Unu...
Jo-Jo, that is not the place for the cymbal crash.
Carol, what does she have to hang on to a handkerchief for?
- You'd think she had hay fever.
- Don't be rude.
But this is supposed to be a swing number.
- As I was saying...
- Judy, don't pay any attention to her.
Last week you were Kathryn Grayson.
This week you're Hildegard.
Couldrt you be just plain Judy Foster for tonight?
If you don't like the way I sing, Oogie, you can use my understudy, Mitzi.
All right, Judy, have it your own way.
You always do, anyway.
Here, you may as well take this too.
After all, Oogie, someone has to supervise us or we'd be here all night.
I gotta call Mother.
I'll be back in a minute.
CAROL:
Hurry back, Judy.
The things a man has to put up with.
Yes, Judy, your dress came.
Yes, it's lovely, Judy.
Nightingale is pressing it now.
Well, you better hurry home.
It's almost time for dinner.
All right, dear.
- Feeling better, Melvin?
- Yes, a little bit.
You should see Dr. Lippincott about some glasses.
Oh, nonsense.
My eyes are just as good now as the day I met you.
Ooh.
- Hi, Dad. Hi, Mom.
- Hi.
Do you have to sneak into the house like that, Randolph?
Why don't you blow a siren?
- Your father has a headache.
- Yes, I have a headache.
What he needs is glasses.
[SINGING]
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low
Dora, can't you teach her another song?
- She's a very good cook, Melvin.
- Yeah.
Hey, Mom, would you ask Father if I could have 50 cents?
Dora, will you tell your son that he may not have 50 cents?
Bad timing, Randolph.
- Hello, Father. Hello, Mother.
- Hi, darling.
Do you have to slam the door like that, Judy?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Look, I've got an orchid.
- Your father's got a headache.
- What he needs is glasses.
My eyes are just as good as a 1 6-year-old boy's.
Well, Jo-Jo Hoffenpepper's only 1 5 and he can't see a thing.
I'm sure Oogie would be upset if he saw you wearing his orchid now.
It will be dead before the dance.
That's when you have acid in your system or something.
I'll never get dinner on, Mrs. Foster, if you don't get Gramps out of my kitchen.
- Here, take over, Judy.
- All right.
- Father...
- Mm-hm.
...l've been thinking.
No, what now?
Well, Mitzi wears false eyelashes.
Could I wear false eyelashes tonight?
- No, you may not.
- I'll sell you mine for a dime.
Father, you're going to have to do something about Randolph.
- What do you want us to do, drown him?
- Somebody drowned?
No, Gramps. Not yet, anyway.
[PHONE RINGING]
- Doorbell's ringing, Dora.
RANDOLPH: Uh-uh. Telephone.
I'm gonna have that telephone disconnected.
Oh, Mother, say something to Father.
- Hello, Father.
- Hello, Mother.
The Pringle butler on the wire for Miss Foster.
He says it's very urgent.
Matter of life or death, no doubt.
Dinner's ready whenever you are.
Why can't we have a butler like the Pringles do?
Why can't we be civilized?
One more word about the Pringles or the oxblood nail polish...
...or the long eyelashes and I'm going to forget that I'm civilized.
- Oh, Father.
- Oh, brother.
Oh, Jameson.
Yes, Jameson? I'll wait.
- Miss Foster on the phone.
- Thank you, Jameson.
Judy, dear,
I thought you'd like to know...
...that Xavier Cugat accepted my invitation to the dance tonight.
He seemed very pleased when I told him that he'd be guest of honor.
Oh, now, Judy, as for your dress for tonight, what are you wearing?
You have a new dress?
It's blue?
Judy, dear, don't you think your pink would be more appropriate?
Your complexion really calls for pink.
It brings out the freshness and charm of your youth.
That's fine.
I knew you would agree with me.
Au revoir for now.
Miss, your father called to say he'll not be home for dinner.
Thank you.
A very smart man.
Ogden, I think it's up to you to find Father and talk to him.
I don't think he'd remember me.
Tell him it would be a good strategic move for him to come to the dance.
It'd promote goodwill with his depositors.
Now, how am I gonna find Father, eat dinner...
...and pick up Judy all in time for the dance?
Simple, Ogden, you don't eat.
Don't eat? lturbi never eats before a concert.
I'm not lturbi. I'm Oogie, remember?
And besides, what about Judy?
I gotta pick her up.
Ogden, it's a fundamental law of human nature...
...that women are always more attracted to men who ignore them.
OGDEN:
I don't think Judy knows that law.
Well, of course she doesn't.
You spoil her.
- You shouldn't do that.
- I shouldn't?
And you should never have given her an orchid.
Now she'll expect one every week.
- She will?
- Naturally.
You've set a very high standard.
It's hard to live up to it.
Well, golly, Carol, what am I gonna do?
Don't let her know you're so interested.
Take tonight, for instance.
Let somebody else call for her.
Be indifferent.
Do you really think so, Carol?
Of course.
I'll arrange for someone to call for her.
Then, when she sees you again...
...she'll be so relieved, she'll probably fall right in your arms.
Hm.
She's never done that before.
How do I look?
You look lovely, dear.
But what about the new dress?
Yeah, the one that was so vital.
Oh, blue does nothing for me.
Oh, now, wait a minute.
For the last six weeks, I've heard nothing but how important it was...
...that you should have a new dress for this dance tonight.
Now that you have it, you're not going to wear it.
Why?
It would be very difficult to explain to you.
And I'm sure it would take too much time.
- Come on, Melvin.
- All right, all right.
- You're coming along with us, honey?
- Oh, Father, really.
Why, if I walked in there with my parents
I'd be the laughingstock.
How do you like that?
Well, maybe we had better wear a disguise.
Oh, Father.
Sometimes I think you don't understand a thing about women.
It's time you and Gramps had a heart-to-heart talk.
You wait for Oogie, dear, and make a grand entrance.
- Have a good time.
JUD Y: I will.
MELVIN: Goodbye, son.
RANDOLPH: So long.
Maybe I should have worn a girdle.
What do you got to hold in?
Oh, Randolph.
Judy...
...if I didn't know better I'd swear your grandmother was standing there.
Why, she used to wear a pink dress just like that.
While you're waiting, would you do your old Gramps a favor?
Of course, Gramps.
Your favorite?
[PLAYING PIANO]
[SINGING]
Through the years
I'll take my place beside you
Smiling through the years
Through your tears
I keep my place beside you
Smiling through your tears
- I'll be near
- I'll be near
- No matter when or where
- No matter when or where
Remember
What is mine I'll always share
I'll come to you
Smiling through
The years
Thank you, darling, that was nice.
[DOORBELL RINGING]
Telephones, ought to be a law against them.
It's the doorbell, Gramps.
Will you get it? I can make an entrance.
- You look mighty pretty, Miss Judy.
JUD Y: Thanks, Nightingale.
Now, Judy?
Now, Gramps.
- Evening, Oogie.
- I'm not Oogie. I'm Jo-Jo.
GRAMPS:
Oh, Jo-Jo, come in.
- Jo-Jo's here, Judy.
- Jo-Jo?
- What are you doing here?
- I came to take you to the dance.
What?
- Where's Oogie?
- He's busy.
Busy?
You mean...
You mean, he expects me, Judy Foster...
...to go to the high school closing dance with a mere child?
- An infant, a half-pint?
- I'm taking vitamins.
Oogie can't do this to me.
I won't stand for it.
- You mean, you don't wanna go with me?
- No, I don't.
Can I go now?
Why... Why, how dare you.
You should be thrilled to have a date with an older woman.
Thrilled, she says.
I've got to use this phone.
It's an emergency.
So is this. I'm trying to borrow
Peewee Finnegars electric worm finder.
Oh, Randolph.
- Randolph, give me that phone.
- Four bits and it's yours.
Of all the mercenary, money-grabbing...
Hello, Peewee?
- Evening, Judy.
- Hello, Pop.
[MUSIC PLAYS ON JUKEBO X]
[MUSIC PLAYS QUIETLY]
JUD Y:
Mr. Pringle?
This is to inform you that our friendship, as of tonight, is dissolved.
You can have your class pin back.
And I'm sending at my earliest convenience your 1 2 boogie-woogie records.
Is anything wrong?
Why do men always say,
"Is anything wrong?"
Yes, somebody came for me.
Jo-Jo Hoffenpepper indeed.
Why didn't you just send a midget?
Anything wrong, Judy?
Oh, just everything, Pop. Everything.
Oh, now, you look beautiful.
In high heels too.
An inch and a half.
Next year I'm gonna have 2 inches, that is if I live that long.
Oh, now, what you need is a strawberry parfait.
What I need is the date for the dance tonight.
- Pop, who's that?
- Uh?
Oh, that's Stephen Andrews, my nephew.
Oh, he's wonderful.
Yeah, he's late.
- Is he married?
POP: No, he's not married.
- Is he engaged?
- Yes, to me, for the summer.
Do you think that maybe he could, um...?
You sit right there and don't you move.
I'll wait. I won't move an inch.
I wonder if you'd do me a little favor?
Why, sure, Pop. What is it?
Well, how would you like to take a beautiful young lady to a dance?
You call that a favor? Who is she?
Well, she's a friend of mine.
An old friend. That is, we've known each other a long time.
Where is she?
Right there.
- You mean... You mean that youngster?
- Shh.
Now, wait a minute, she's only a child.
I'd look great taking her to a dance.
Now, Stephen, this is important.
Her heart's breaking.
You got a kid sister, you know how tragic something like this can be.
Now, besides, I promised her.
Come on.
All right, Pop, you win.
But it's against my better judgment.
And if I send out an SOS,
I'll expect your help.
GRAMPS [SINGING]:
It's a most unusual day
Gramps.
Nobody's gonna stand up my granddaughter. No, sirree.
Oh, you're a lamb.
I'll take you to the dance and fetch you home.
And if they play a polka,
I'll even dance with you.
Oh, thanks, Gramps, but I think that maybe I have a date.
POP:
You have, Judy.
Stephen, Judy.
- Hello, Judy.
- Hello. Gramps, this is Stephen.
Glad to know you, Gramps.
Always tell a mars character the way he shakes.
Thank you, sir.
We'd better hurry, Stephen.
I don't wanna miss a minute of the dance.
Goodbye, Gramps. Bye, Mr. Scully.
Oh, dear.
- How about a cherry phosphate?
- Don't mind if I do.
Got anything to put a little sting in it?
Hey, Jo-Jo, take over for me for a minute, will you?
Look.
Don't worry, Oogie.
Everything will be all right.
Yeah, and in the meantime,
I'm a bachelor.
Melvin, who's Judy dancing with?
I can't tell at this distance.
Well, you need glasses, Mr. Foster.
My eyes are perfect.
Judy, hey.
I think the orchestra leader is trying to attract your attention, Judy.
Ignore it.
He's just someone I used to know in my childhood.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...our popular 1 6-year-old singer,
Miss Judy Foster...
...will sing for you now.
That's despicable, that's what it is.
It's despicable.
He knows that I'm practically 1 7.
Any man who'd reveal a womars age should be horsewhipped.
Would you?
I'd much rather hear you sing, Judy.
All right, Stephen.
But only because you want me to.
Your pin, Mr. Pringle.
Oh, Judy, please don't be mad at me.
I meant to pick you up.
Honest I did, but I had other things to do.
And besides, I ought to be mad at you, coming in here late with some other guy.
Kindly, play the introduction to "Love Is Where You Find lt."
You can't sing that tonight, Judy.
"Love Is Where You Find lt"...
...is the song you're gonna sing on your parents' anniversary.
Oogie, "Love Is Where You Find lt."
Very well.
"Love Is Where You Find lt."
[SINGING]
Love is where you find it
Don't be blind
It's all around you everywhere
Take it, take a chance now
For romance now
Tell a someone that you care
Spring love comes upon you
When it's gone you feel despair
Soon, though, in the moon glow
You'll find that a new love is there
Love is where you find it
Fate designed it
To be waiting everywhere
It may hide from you for a while
It may come tonight in a smile
And a plea for the new love
In the arms of a new love
Seek and you shall
Find
Love is where you find it
Don't be blind, it's all around you
Everywhere
Everywhere
Judy, isn't there something I can do to make up with you?
Yes, Mr. Pringle...
...you may borrow some of Jo-Jo's vitamins.
Did you like my song, Stephen?
I thought it was wonderful.
I think you're swell.
- Oh, you're magnificent. Have some punch.
- Thank you.
Judy, you didn't sing the song that we rehearsed this afternoon.
Oh, I'm sorry, Carol.
But I had to sing a special song for a special person.
Oh, Stephen, this is Carol Pringle.
Carol, this is Stephen.
- How do you do?
- Hello, Carol.
Judy, dear, it's time for Mr. Cugat to arrive.
You'd better be in the door to welcome him.
- Well, l...
- Run along. Business comes first.
I'll be right back.
Don't you go away.
Don't worry, Judy. I'll be right here.
I have a few moments to spare if you'd care to dance.
Oh, that's very generous of you.
I don't believe I know who you are.
I'm sure you don't.
- But I know who you are.
- You do?
You're the prettiest girl in Santa Barbara.
That's obvious.
Well, thank you very much.
And you know it. That's also obvious.
That wasrt very nice, was it?
No, it wasrt. I'm sorry.
You spending the summer here?
I think most of it will be spent at Scully's drug store.
Better come in sometime and sample a malted milk.
I never drink malt.
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm in charge of the program.
Judy, won't you listen to me for just a minute?
Please don't talk to me.
I've just renounced you.
But I don't wanna be renounced.
I want you to wear my pin.
In fact, I'm going to erase your name from my diary.
You know, Judy, sometimes
I think you don't like me at all.
- Good evening.
- Oh, Mr. Cugat.
I thought maybe
I got in the wrong place, no?
Oh, no, this is the right place.
Come with me.
I'll introduce you around.
- There's some other old people here too.
- Oh?
Who's the young man Judy's with?
His name's Stephen Andrews.
He works at Scully's drugstore.
Nice-looking fellow.
Yes, I supposed one might say that he is.
I'm sorry my father isn't here tonight.
He promised he'd try to come.
Well, you know how businessmen are.
Sometimes it's very hard to find time to go to a high school dance.
You always seem to find time,
Mr. Foster.
Oh, that's because I guess I'm curious.
I want to know what's going on.
I think it's very nice...
...having someone who wants to know what's going on.
Just the opposite in our family.
My father never knows what's going on.
Of course, he's extremely busy man.
MELVIN:
Oh, of course he is, yes.
Sometimes I wish...
Sometimes I wish he werert so busy.
Will you excuse me?
I'm sure Ogden needs me.
Mr. Cugat, this is my mother and father,
Mr. and Mrs. Foster.
How do you do, Mr. Cugat?
Nice to meet you.
Hello, Mr. Cugat. Wort you sit down?
Thank you, I will.
My daughter, Judy, is a great admirer of yours.
- So is her mother.
- Well, thank you, thank you.
That's a charming compliment from two very charming ladies.
[BAND PLAYING]
They're playing that especially for you,
Mr. Cugat.
Melvin.
Arert you going to dance with me?
What? A man of my age get out there...
...and make a fool of himself like those jack-in-the-boxes?
Well, you could do a more dignified version, dear.
Dora, look, I've been a faithful husband to you for 1 9 years, haven't I?
Twenty. It's our anniversary next week.
Remember, dear?
- A good provider?
- Yes.
- Satisfactory father to the children?
- Yes.
Then please don't ask me to rumba.
If you don't mind, Señor Foster...
...perhaps your wife will do the rumba with me?
Oh, sure, go ahead and ask her.
You won't have to coax her.
Thank you, Mr. Cugat. I'd love it.
It's a shame
Mother has to dance by herself.
- Judy?
- Yes, Father?
I don't wanna hear another word about me learning to do that rumba.
Yes, Father.
But I would like to hear who the young man was you were dancing with.
Well, that's my dream man.
What about Oogie?
Oh, I just gave him up forever for a little while.
- Oh, I see.
- Would you like to meet Stephen?
Well, I believe it's customary.
If you can get him away from Mitzi there.
So that's what happens when my back is turned.
Excuse me, Father.
Mitzi, dear, Oogie wants you.
Oh, well, tell him I'm busy right now.
Mitzi, Oogie wants you now.
Oh, thank you, Stephen.
It's just been wonderful.
I'll be right back.
You do wanna dance with me, don't you, Stephen?
It would be a pleasure, Judy.
Where's Mrs. Foster?
Out there dancing the rumba with Mr. Cugat.
Oh.
Kind of a vulgar dance, don't you think?
I can't do it either.
Mrs. Foster, you are what we call muy guapa.
- Oh. Is that good?
- Well, in my language...
...it means terrific.
- Oh.
Oh, I'd spend the rest of my life singing for you, Stephen.
I don't think Oogie would like that very well.
- Oogie brought this all on himself.
- All right.
But don't be too rough on him.
He's a nice guy.
Good night.
Thank you for a very nice evening.
JUD Y: Good night, Stephen, and thank you for a very nice evening.
- Well, good night.
- Stephen...
...do you think a girl should let a boy kiss her on their first date?
I most certainly do not.
- Not even...
- Not even then, Judy.
Good night...
...sweet 1 6.
Almost 1 7.
If I'd taken Judy to the dance tonight, that malt mixer wouldn't have taken her.
And if he hadrt taken her, she wouldn't have met him.
And I wouldn't be miserable like I am now.
I'm sure Mr. Andrews realizes the obvious difference in their ages.
Maybe so. But does Judy?
She even kissed him.
She did?
I've known her all my life.
She's never kissed me, except on birthdays.
He's better looking than I am too.
Does she really mean that much to you?
Sure she does.
She's real fine.
Oh, why didn't he fall for you instead of my girl?
You haven't any heart, that's all.
I have a heart, Oogie.
It's just that I haven't had much chance to use it.
Like...
...neither one of us has had much chance.
I don't have anyone to talk to.
You don't have anyone to talk to.
I guess we just have to talk to each other.
Oh, I wish Mother were here.
Me too.
I'll take care of everything, Oogie.
Oh, no, look, Carol, l...
I said I'd take care of everything.
OGDEN:
Good night.
[SINGING]
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
She's going to swing so low, they're going to have to carry me home.
Now, Melvin.
Your breakfast is getting cold, dear.
- Breakfast?
- That's right, breakfast.
Yeah, we're different than most families.
We have breakfast in the morning, lunch at lunchtime and dinner at...
Never mind, Randolph.
Drink your orange juice, dear.
What did you say, Father?
I didn't a say a word, it was your mother who just spoke.
- What's the matter with you, anyway?
- Hm?
Melvin, see if you can get through to her.
I'll try, Dora. It might take a little time.
Judy? Judy Foster.
Good morning, Father.
Good morning, dear ones.
RANDOLPH:
Whee! You got through.
Judy, did you and Oogie make up?
My heart belongs to Stephen.
I think we have a lead.
Where did you meet Stephen, dear?
I met him in a prescription booth.
Ah, he's a soda jerk.
I'm sorry, this household just isn't big enough for both Randolph and me.
Eventually, one of us has to go.
Father, you'll have to make the choice.
Well, Dora, what do you think?
You have a preference?
Well, it's something we can't decide in a hurry.
I think we ought to have at least until tomorrow morning.
Now you're making fun of me.
You never take anything I say seriously.
Yes, we do, darling.
But having to make a choice between you and Randolph is serious indeed.
Now sit down and eat your breakfast.
Why, there's a picture of Mr. Cugat.
- I hadrt seen it.
- What you need is glasses.
Dr. Lippincott can fix you up.
Oh. Ha-ha.
Yeah. Oh, he hasn't changed since last night.
You know, he's a very romantic man.
He said I was muy guapa.
- What?
- Oh, that's a compliment.
Wow, look at that prized string of palominos he's got.
Oh, that's nothing. I can have my face splashed on there anytime.
Father, you'd look perfectly ridiculous standing beside a string of mackerel.
And he dances divinely.
He should.
That's his business.
My business is canning fish.
If you really loved me, Melvin, you'd learn how to rumba.
Oh, what is my loving you got to do with that ridiculous dance?
Nothing, Melvin.
Except that when I go to dances,
I like to dance...
...and I like to dance with my husband.
That reminds me, the drug store is open.
Bye, everybody.
Where's Judy? Why didn't she come down for breakfast?
Nothing like a quiet breakfast with the Fosters, is there?
- Melvin?
- Mm-hm?
I love you.
Even if you can't rumba like Mr. Cugat.
Muy guapa sounds like birdseed.
How was the dance?
It was fine. I met a lot of nice people.
Say, Pop, do you know a girl by the name of Carol Pringle?
Sure, sure.
Everybody knows the Pringles.
She never comes in here, though.
Not since she grew out of her bobby socks, anyway.
CAROL:
Good morning, Mr. Scully.
Met a lot of nice people, huh?
Hello, Miss Pringle.
I haven't seen you for some time.
How's your father?
Well, he's fine, thank you.
Anything I can do for you?
I thought perhaps Judy would be here.
I wanted to talk to her.
Well, she isn't here, but I'm reasonably sure she will be.
Hello.
Hello.
Didrt know I was artistic, did you?
I know very little about you.
Go ahead, eat it.
There ought to be more fancy ice cream sundaes in everybody's life.
- Thanks.
- Hi, Carol.
- Hello, Stephen.
- Hello, Judy.
- That looks yummy.
- Would you like it?
No, thanks. I came to talk to Stephen.
What are you doing here?
Well, I wanted to talk to you, Judy.
I thought I'd find you here.
I finally convinced Father to let you and Oogie try out on his radio station.
You did? Oh, that's stinky super.
Of course, it's only a sustaining program...
...but undoubtedly you can get your father to sponsor it.
My father seems to think that his fish can get along very well without my help.
Oh, but I'm sure your voice would double his sales, Judy.
Gee, I don't know.
Why don't you go and talk to him about it?
Maybe he will see it our way, Carol.
I'll go right away.
Don't go away, I'll be right back.
So long, Judy.
- Cute as a button, isn't she?
- Judy's a charming child.
It's nice to see a young girl act her age.
Yes, and 1 6 is such a nice age to be.
Oh. You remember.
[LAUGHS]
You are amusing, Stephen.
Oh, by the way, I thought perhaps you'd like to drop around for dinner tonight.
You've talked me into it.
- Shall we say 7:00?
- Seven o'clock.
Why, Carol, you've hardly touched a bite.
- Don't you like it?
- Oh, of course.
That's what I like to see, a girl with a healthy appetite.
Hi, Carol.
- Hi, Carol.
- Oh, give me one of those, will you?
[CHATTERING]
This is Mr. Foster's office, yes?
- And you are Miss Rosita.
- That's right.
Come in.
- Mr. Foster is expecting you.
- Good.
Mr. Foster, this is Miss Rosita.
MELVIN: How do you do, Miss Rosita?
- How do you do?
Thank you, Miss Clarke, and please see that we're not disturbed for about an hour.
Yes, Mr. Foster.
I really don't know how to explain this to you, but l...
You want to rumba, yes? That is it, huh?
Well, not exactly. I really don't want...
Well, yes, I do want to.
You see, Mr. Cugat told me that you could teach me.
- Do you think you could?
- Of course I can.
I'm not the ballroom type.
I spent most of my life at sea on these here fishing boats.
They didn't do much rumba dancing there.
Mr. Foster, I put you in my hands.
You watch me and I show you the beginning steps.
You see, it is just a matter of a little wiggle here and a little wiggle there.
You have to get the right wiggle at the right place and at the right time.
Everything will be fine. I'll show you.
Watch me.
[DANCE MUSIC PLAYS]
See, the only way to learn is to do it.
Come on.
Now turn this way.
Good. Now this way.
Turn this way.
That's it.
See?
Oh, Miss Clarke, I've got to see Father.
Judy, I'm very sorry.
Your father is busy, very busy.
- But this is vital.
- What your father is doing is also vital.
- Is he in conference?
- Oh, not exactly.
I'll bet he's asleep.
Judy. Your father is not in habit of sleeping during business hours.
Well, if he's not asleep, what else can he be doing?
- I've got to see him.
- Well, just let me announce you.
Oh, Mr. Foster, your daughter is here.
She says it's very important.
All right.
- Just a second, Judy.
- Thank you.
That's a pretty dress you're wearing.
Lovely color.
- Well, seconds up. Thanks.
- But, Judy...
Miss Clarke said you were busy, but you don't look very busy to me.
I am very busy. Thinking, Judy, thinking.
I'm glad you're thinking because I have something I want you to think about.
You always do. What is it now?
Well, you see,
Carol talked to her father...
...and her father said that maybe my father would sponsor a program...
...on his radio station so Oogie and I can be on the air.
Well, I thought that you and Oogie had split up.
Well, this is strictly business.
Carol said it will double your sale of fish.
Now, Judy, my fish are doing just dandy without any radio advertising...
...and I might add, without the advice of Carol.
I was only trying to help your fish.
I appreciate that, and the fish do too.
- But, Father, if we...
- Now, now, now.
You run along home and we'll take it up later. Come on.
But I can't go home, Father.
I have a very important day at the drug store.
Well, then, you run on to the drug store.
Goodbye, Judy.
Goodbye.
Oh, Miss Rosita, I want to apologize.
I didn't have time...
Mr. Foster, my profession is an honorable one.
You engaged me to teach you the rumba, don't you?
And I do not teach in closets.
Oh, well, wait, wait. Oh, listen.
Oh, please, Miss Rosita, please.
That was my daughter that was just in here.
And if she saw you, that would spoil everything.
What do you mean, spoil everything?
I thought you're a respectable man.
Oh, I am, honest. Believe me, I am.
You see, I'm doing this for my family.
- It's a great big surprise.
- What surprise?
Well, next week, my wife and I are celebrating our wedding anniversary.
For years, she's wanted me to learn how to rumba and it's for her.
Oh, so that is it, huh? When you say you celebrate this anniversary?
- Next week.
- Next week.
All right, I stay.
But remember, if I teach in any more closets, I raise the price.
And with you
I'm starting from behind scratch.
Oh, that's your daughter, no?
No, my wife.
But she looks so young.
You know something?
You too would look 1 0 years younger, if you did not dress so stuffy.
- Stuffy?
- Si, look at that tie here.
So tired. Throw him away.
And that tummy, that should go too.
Well, never mind.
We'll get rid of them dancing.
With a beautiful wife like this, you better be on your toes, you know.
- She is beautiful, isn't she, huh?
- Yeah.
Now we come into the business, huh?
Let's try again. Chin up.
Waist in.
Shoulders back. Chest out.
Come now.
One, two, three, hip.
One, two, three, hip.
Watch the hip.
- One, two...
- I am, lady, I am.
Then go ahead. Do it.
One, two, three, hip.
One, two, three, hip. That's it.
One, two, three, hip. One...
That's right, Jameson.
We'll use candlelight.
Yes, miss, candlelight.
And two martinis, Jameson.
One with alcohol and one without.
Oh, but don't forget the olive.
Uh, no, miss.
After dinner, you may build a fire in the fireplace.
I beg your pardon, miss, but I think it's a bit warm for a fire.
Then we'll open the windows.
Yes, miss.
Oh, thank you.
After we have our demitasse, you may take the rest of the evening off.
Oh, yes, miss. I understand.
[DOORBELL RINGING]
Good evening, sir.
Oh, good evening, Miss Judy.
Hi, Jameson. Tell Miss Carol that I'm here and that Mr. Andrews is too.
Yes, miss. Would you just wait in the living room, please?
I beg your pardon, miss.
Mr. Andrews is here and Miss Judy.
- Judy?
- Yes, miss.
You'll have to set another place, quickly.
I don't think the pheasant will stretch three ways.
Give Mr. Andrews the neck.
- Yes, miss.
- And you better forget about the martinis.
Yes, miss.
- Hello.
STEPHEN: Good evening.
Judy, how wonderful to see you, both of you.
It was so nice of you to invite us to dinner.
I'm so glad you could come.
What's the matter? Is something wrong?
- Oh, where's Oogie?
- He won't be here for dinner.
- He won't?
- He won't?
CAROL:
He'll be here later.
Just because he lives here,
I don't see why he should always be here.
Dinner is served, Miss Carol.
Thank you, Jameson. Shall we?
We thank you for this food...
...and for the privilege of eating it together and in peace. Amen.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
- Telephone's ringing, Nightingale.
- It's the door, Gramps.
Doorbells, phone bells, bells is always ringing.
And the doors and bells and everything.
Hello, Nightingale.
Lan sakes.
Oogie, how is it you always manage to get here...
...just when everybody's eating dinner.
Oh, it's no trouble at all.
- Hello, Oogie.
- Hello, Mrs. Foster, everybody.
- Hi.
- You lose something, Oogie?
Oh, no, nothing at all.
- Will you have dinner with us, Oogie?
- Sure, thank you.
- Isn't Judy here?
- No, Judy won't be here for dinner.
- She's having dinner with your sister.
- She is?
So that's why she wanted me to eat at the drugstore.
Yeah, she wanted me to leave so that she could talk to Judy.
If I were at the house, she couldn't talk to Judy...
...so therefore she asked me to leave.
See what I mean?
No, I don't see what you mean.
I'll take your word for it, though.
That must be it.
Sure, she's fixing everything up.
Yes, sir, that's it.
[PHONE RINGING]
- Doorbell.
- Wrong again, Gramps, telephone.
If I don't pay the telephone bill, how soon will they take it out?
Now, Melvin.
Mr. Pringle, you're wanted on the telephone.
Oh, thanks. You see, it's just like I told you.
Excuse me.
Randolph, what language does he speak?
For 25 cents, I'll translate it.
OGDEN:
Yeah? She is?
She did? She has?
She does? Yeah-hoo!
I'll be right home.
I take it back.
I have to have 50 cents to translate that.
JUD Y [SINGING]:
Love is where you find it
Don't be blind
It's all around you everywhere
Spring love comes upon you
When it's gone, you feel despair
- Hi, Oogie. Glad to see you.
- Hi.
- Hi, Judy. Why did you stop?
- The mood's been broken.
Seems to me you're getting awfully moody lately.
CAROL:
Sit down, Oogie.
Holy jeepers.
Who wants a fire on a night like this?
I find it cozy.
Very cozy.
How cozy can you get?
I don't see how I can possibly do a radio program with him.
- He's impossible.
- What radio program?
JUD Y: The one Carol fixed for us to do on your father's station.
OGDEN: I don't know anything about it.
I'll bet father doesn't.
He won't even let me inside the station.
If Carol says it's all right, it's all right.
Why don't you and Oogie run through your number.
- You could use it for the initial broadcast.
- I don't feel like it.
- She just wants to be coaxed.
- Please do, Judy, I'd like to hear it.
You would?
Well, all right, then.
Let's proceed, Oogie.
[OGDEN PLAYS PIANO]
[SINGING]
When I was just a little girl
A long, long time ago
I promised me I'd grow to be
A woman of the world
But fate plays many funny tricks
It did to me, I know
And as Jimmy Durante puts it
I've been foiled
I'm strictly on the corny side
Corny side, corny side
I'm strictly on the corny side
But the boys like me that way
I never go for city chicks
I can't mix, got no tricks
But put me with the cows and chicks
And you'll find that I'm not hay
- I'm a real hillbilly
- The gals go silly
A willy-nilly when I roll my eyes
- You're a real humdinger
- Don't you point your finger
I just do it for the exercise
We're strictly on the corny side
Corny side, corny side
We're strictly on the corny side
And the folks like us that way
I used to dream of being quite a siren
With cavaliers bedecking me with jewels
I'd have a yacht
A foreign car to drive in
But now I drive a pair of seven mules
I used to wanna be a wealthy broker
With secretaries sitting on my knee
I guess I'll wind up being just a joker
Shaking apples from an apple tree
We're strictly on the corny side
Corny side, corny side
We're strictly on the corny side
And that's the place to be
You can have the city
You can save your pity
For the folks who run around and scream
Oh, the country's quiet
Come along and try it
Down by the Old Mill stream
- We're strictly on the corn
- We're strictly on the corny side
Corny side, corny side
We're strictly on the corny side
And that's the place to be
Thank you, Judy.
Better run through it again, though.
I think we should leave them alone while they rehearse.
OGDEN: Yeah, and there's a terrific moon out tonight.
The moon has nothing to do with it,
Ogden.
I can hear you from out here.
OGDEN:
Please don't go. I'd like to talk to you.
Go ahead, talk.
Don't you like me anymore, Judy?
Of course I do, Oogie.
But there comes a time when people must find the way of their hearts.
And follow their hearts.
I know the way in my heart.
I know that someday when I'm through school and have a job...
...well, then I'm gonna ask you to marry me.
Jinkies, if I have to wait for all that to happen...
...l'll be too old to marry.
Well, the least you can do when a man asks you to marry him is be polite.
Mr. Pringle, I feel that I'm under no obligation to you whatsoever...
...as far as marriage is concerned.
I'm an adult now and I must conduct myself accordingly.
- What? Judy, are you hurt?
- You pushed me.
Pushed you?
How can you say such a thing?
Don't you ever speak to me again.
I should have pushed her.
Why did you bring Judy tonight,
Stephen?
She came back to the drugstore this afternoon.
A lot of her girlfriends were there.
She said she had a date with me tonight.
- They said she didn't so l...
- So you said she did.
Well, you know how it is.
I can't say that I do.
Just how is it?
You're a funny girl.
You've got everything any girl could possibly want.
You're beautiful.
It's almost too beautiful.
You have youth, education, a lovely home.
With all these things, why do you have to try so hard to impress people?
- Is that the way you feel about me?
- I'm afraid it is.
- Then I think you're very rude.
- And I think you're very spoiled.
I'm not interested in your personal opinion,
Mr. Andrews.
That's a good sign. It's the first time
I've seen you follow a natural impulse.
If I followed my natural impulse,
I'd push you in the flowerbed. Good night.
- Where's Judy?
- She's upstairs.
And will you tell her I didn't push her?
Women.
I know what you mean.
Look, Steve, you wouldn't take my girl away from me, would you?
Why, you bet your life I wouldn't, Oogie.
I wouldn't have a chance even if I wanted to.
No?
When a girl goes to all the trouble
Judy does to make you jealous...
...that's true love.
Gee, I never thought of that.
Steve, you're a man of the world.
Do you think Judy will be easier to understand as she gets older?
Don't try to understand women, Oogie, just accept them.
I guess that would be easier.
And, Oogie, would you mind taking
Judy home when she comes down?
- I gotta go back to work.
- Oh, glad to, Steve. Glad to.
- Tell Carol good night for me, will you?
- You bet. Come back again, Steve.
- Anytime, anytime at all.
- Thanks, Oogie.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night, Steve, old boy.
Oh, Jameson.
Could you fix me a double-decker ham-and-cheese sandwich, please?
- I'll try, sir. And a glass of milk?
- Yeah.
Let's make it four-decker.
Four? Yes, sir.
Carol?
You know much more about men than I do.
Tell me about them, will you?
There's little to tell, Judy.
If you know one man, you know them all.
Of course, Stephers different.
Stephers a man, Judy.
And once a person is a man, there's nothing anyone can do about it.
Oh, I don't wanna do anything about it.
The pathetic part of it all is they never improve with age.
In fact, they get worse.
Shakespeare once said,
"A man in his time plays many parts.
His acts being seven ages."
Of course, I never did see eye-to-eye with Shakespeare.
As far as I'm concerned, there are but three ages:
Youth, middle age and infirmity.
It's the middle age we have to be aware of because that's the critical age.
Oh, but Stephers not middle-aged.
He isn't now, but he will be someday.
All men reach it.
My father did.
Believe me, Judy.
Then they are a problem.
Jinkies.
How do you know when they reach that critical age?
Oh, by little things.
Sudden changes in their habits.
They start throwing money away like mad.
Maybe something as minor as a sudden obsession for bright clothes.
In my father's case...
...it was a desire for monogrammed silk shirts.
Oh, I had a terrible two years.
Oh, I think my father skipped that critical age.
He doesn't do any of those things, particularly throw money away.
But you never can tell, Judy.
Really?
With men, it can happen overnight.
[HUMMING]
One, two, three, shake hips.
One, two, three, shake hips.
One, two, three, shake hips.
One, two, three, shake hips.
[DOOR CLOSES]
Father.
Father, what are you doing up so late?
You should be in bed.
Oh, reading, just reading.
Trying to improve my mind.
But you never read before you go to bed.
And it's so late.
Now, wait a minute, young lady.
I'm supposed to ask the questions in this house.
What are you doing out so late?
Oogie took a shortcut and we got lost.
Oh, yeah.
I've heard that from before.
Time for you to go to bed, Judy.
Father, I'd like to ask you a few questions if I may.
Sure, go ahead.
Please sit down.
Do you remember how you felt when you first met Mother?
Sure, I felt fine.
Did you know right away that you loved her?
Of course I did.
And did you tell her so?
Well, no, not right then.
After all, I didn't want her know that I was that easy...
...so I just sort of let her tell me.
- Oh, I see.
- But, Judy...
...don't mention that to your mother, will you, please?
And you were happy just to be alive, werert you?
And the whole world seemed brighter...
...and music sounded much sweeter.
Oh, yes, I was happy.
And Mother got the same way.
I know, she did.
- She told me so.
- She did?
She did.
Hey, what are you driving at, anyway?
Well, Father...
...I feel the same way now as Mother did when she first met you.
I'm in love. Terribly in love.
I want to get married.
Well, Judy, you're kind of young, don't you think?
And Oogie, well, his allowance isn't enough to support a wife on.
Oh, Father, I'm not talking about a child.
I'm talking about a man, Stephen.
Stephen Andrews.
Has he asked you?
No.
Of course, I haven't give him any encouragement.
But I'm sure he feels the same way about me as you did about Mother.
When the right time arrives...
...l'll ask him.
Well, Judy, you're just a little child.
But Mother was only 1 7 when she married you.
Well...
This is terribly serious. l...
Coming especially at this time when I really need your help.
Oh, Father, you know if you need me,
I'll stay.
Well, I was thinking about that there radio program of yours.
You know, a little advertising might be of great help to me now.
If you're leaving, you won't be of any help.
Father, you know I'll always stand by you.
Even if it means working with Oogie.
My working with him will have to be a strictly business basis.
Oh, naturally. Strictly business, of course.
Now you run on to bed and we'll talk over again in a few days.
If you don't mind, I'd like to stay down just a little while longer if I may.
I have so many things to think about.
So many, many things.
All right, you stay down here a few minutes and think.
But if you don't come upstairs in 1 0 minutes, I'm coming down...
...and carry you up piggyback, like I used do before you grew up.
- Oh, Father.
- Good night, honey.
Good night, Father.
[MUSIC PLAYS]
Dora.
- Dora.
- Hm?
Judy's in love.
Oh, that's nice.
Oogie must be happy.
Don't forget to wind the clock.
No, no, no. You don't know what I mean.
It isn't Oogie.
She's in love with Stephen.
Looks very serious.
What? Stephen?
- What are you...? You mean...
- That's what I mean.
Well, he couldn't be serious or could he?
I don't know about him, but Judy is.
Oh, she's just a baby.
Well, I'm not so sure about that.
She informed me that she now feels as you did when you first met me.
Oh, my.
Oh, my.
MAN: No bacon this morning. That new specialist has eliminated pork for my diet.
Davis, I'll come down myself and speak to them.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
What are you doing up so early?
You're not ill, are you?
- No, Father, I'm not ill.
- That's good.
- I wanted to talk to you.
- Hm?
I said, I wanted to talk to you.
What is it? New clothes?
Allowance overdrawn?
- Ogders not in trouble?
- No, Father.
JAMESON:
Your broker is on the wire, sir.
- I'd like to go away for a while.
- Hello, Grayson. Fine.
Change is beneficial. Where you going?
Now, have you sold those shares,
Grayson?
I don't know, Father.
Indecisiors a sign of weakness.
No, no, not you, Grayson, I'm talking to my daughter. What about those shares?
The market broke before you had a chance to sell?
Well, be in my office in half an hour with the figures.
Yes.
Where's Carol?
- She's left, Mr. Pringle.
- She didn't touch her breakfast.
Well, people in love rarely have much appetite, sir.
- In love. Who's in love?
- Miss Carol, I believe, sir.
Nonsense. Well, she only a child. She...
- What do you mean, in love?
- Just that, sir.
With whom? What does he do?
What's he's background?
His name is Stephen Andrews.
He works in Scully's drug store.
What? Wait a minute, Jameson. Did she say something about wanting to go away?
Yeah, I believe she did, sir.
A sensible girl, Carol.
I'll speak to her myself.
You see what you can do about finding out who this fellow is.
Yes, I'll do my best, sir.
[PLAYING PIANO]
LUCIEN:
About this trip, Carol.
I thought you might like to go to your grandmother's.
Maine is very nice this time of the year.
I'm sure it is, Father.
But I changed my mind. I'm staying here.
Oh?
- And, Father?
- Yes, Carol.
You'll be happy to know...
...that American Tel and Tel went up two points today.
[HUMMING]
- Good morning, Nightingale.
- Yes, I suppose it is.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
Even in the morning, the door bells, the phone bells.
This is the "bellingest" house
I've ever been in.
- Good morning, Oogie.
OGDEN: Hello, Nightingale.
How is it you always manage to get here just when everybody's eating?
It's no trouble at all.
Good morning, Oogie. How are you this beautiful glorious morning?
Fine, sir. I mean, I'm not fine.
It's just that I'm...
To tell you the truth,
I'm not fine at all.
Well, well, sit down and tell me all about it, Oogie.
Well, it's like this, Mr. Foster.
I think your daughter is losing interest in me.
Oh, well, you know how girls are, Oogie.
- No, sir, I don't. How are they?
- Well...
You have to keep two jumps ahead of them.
Find out what they want and then don't give it to them.
Later on, surprise them.
Always works, Oogie.
Gee, I can't seem to surprise Judy much.
Seem she always knows what I'm gonna do before I do.
Well, that's because she's a Foster.
Always on her toes.
- Good Morning, Mr. Pringle.
- Oh, hi, Judy.
- Good morning, Father.
- Good morning, Judy, dear.
Father, you're wearing a new tie.
That's right, a new tie. You like it?
I think it's snazzy, Mr. Foster.
But it's so loud.
Well, so it's loud.
I got a dozen more just as loud.
But it's not like you at all.
Mm. Well, I'm a different person, a new man.
After all, a man of my age is liable to get into a rut.
Well, goodbye, Judy, dear.
Goodbye, Oogie.
You two kids try and get along together and work out that there radio idea.
He didn't eat a thing.
- I brought the contract for the radio show...
- We'll have to see Father about it first.
We just saw him.
Mr. Pringle...
...we have a policy in our household.
We never discuss business at home.
We'll have to call on him at the office.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
I'm doing pretty good, don't you think?
Magnificent, wonderful.
Somewhere in your family tree must be hanging a Spaniard.
Let's go.
That's it. Now watch the hip.
- Watch the hip.
- Yeah, I am. I am.
- Hi, Miss Clarke, I wanna see Father.
- You'll have to wait. Your father's busy.
That's what you told me yesterday and the day before.
- I thought this was the slack season.
- Business is picking up.
Oh, but I've got to see him, it's terribly vital.
[PHONE BUZZES]
[MUSIC STOPS]
Hello.
Judy is on her way in. Hold her a minute.
It will be just a minute.
I don't see what difference one little minute makes. Do you?
Judy.
MELVIN:
Well, Judy.
My own little Judy.
Of course, Father. Who else is?
- What brings you two here?
- We came about the radio program.
Oh, yes, of course.
Oogie's drawn up a contract he wants you to sign.
He's gonna be a Supreme Court justice.
Sign here.
Well, Judy, I'd never sign anything before I read it.
Now you two run along.
Well, it's nothing tricky, Mr. Foster.
Just seven years.
Oh, with options.
MELVIN:
Seven years?
Well, what if your voice changes?
Now, here, Judy...
...you take that and buy yourself a new dress for the radio show.
- Buy a dress, Father?
- Yeah, and get yourself some shoes...
...or buy anything that you want to.
But run along.
- Are you sure you feel all right?
- Oh, I feel fine.
OGDEN:
He looks fine to me.
Sure. Fine.
Father, how old are you?
Well, I'm just half as old as you think I am, Judy.
- Run along, go on up to the store.
- I think he wants us to go.
- Get yourself a lot of clothes.
- It's happened.
- Huh?
- Men, beasts. I hate you all.
- Golly, Judy, what did I do?
- Nothing yet, but you will.
- Why?
- Because you're a man.
One of us must be crazy, Judy.
Frankly, I'm bewildered.
From now on, don't you ever speak to me again.
Very well, Miss Foster.
I'll see you at rehearsal at 4.
Purely as maestro and vocalist.
I'm a very patient man, but I've reached the end of my rope.
Miss Clarke...
...do you have trouble with men?
Just getting them, that's all.
For goodness sakes, Oogie, stop pacing.
You'll wear yourself out.
How can you have a rehearsal with nobody to rehearse with.
- Oh, maybe she isn't coming?
- Judy will be here.
Well, where is she?
I'm the last man in the world who would know where Judy Foster is.
OGDEN:
Well, good afternoon, Miss Foster.
You know that we have a radio show to do on Tuesday morning?
Yes, I know, Oogie. I'm ready.
Okay, kids, let's hit it.
Presenting The Foster Fish Program.
[MORNING]
Spend each Tuesday morn at 8
With Judaline
Don't forget you've got a date
With Judaline
Like an angel out of space
Golden hair and a classic face
Nothing like her anyplace
Man, she's really fine
I love the charming way you speak
On Judaline
It brings the color to the cheeks
On Judaline
Although you mean
All the things you've said
You're embarrassing me instead
No one person could be so divine
Lovely as a summer breeze
It is Judaline
Makes me wonder if these charms
Are really mine
If I'm all the things that you see in me
Where's the me that I used to be?
Where is Judy?
You mean Judaline
'Coz I spend my life in being
Judaline
Golly, now what did I do?
This time, Oogie,
I think I'm the one who's at fault.
I'll talk to her.
Judy...
...what's the matter?
Oh, I can't tell you, Carol.
I can't tell anybody.
Come on and sit down.
Don't you trust me, Judy?
Of course I trust you, Carol.
It's just that...
I think men are awful.
Even the ones you think are wonderful...
...turn out to be just like the ones you think aren't wonderful.
Please forgive me, Judy.
I don't know how it happened.
I didn't want it to.
It just did.
I didn't think it was possible to fall in love with anyone so fast.
I wanted so to tell someone.
There wasrt anyone to tell.
Anyway, I don't think he even likes me.
What are you talking about, Carol?
Stephen.
- Werert you?
- No, I wasrt.
If I hadrt decided just this morning to put men completely out of my life...
...l'd be very angry with you.
Very angry indeed.
I guess it must be his age.
It's caught up with him.
I'm talking about my father.
Your father? What are you saying?
He's hiding a woman in his office.
Oh, you must be mistaken.
Your father is wonderful.
- He wouldn't do anything like that.
- This isn't the first time either.
She'll probably be there tomorrow too.
Carol, what shall I do?
I can't tell Mother.
- No, you mustrt do that.
- Tomorrow is their wedding anniversary.
Well, there must be some reason.
There has to be a reason.
How's his home life?
Father says it's noisy.
Usually when a man turns to another woman...
...it's because something's lacking in his home life.
He's seeking a change.
- Maybe he doesn't get enough affection.
- Of course he gets enough affection.
We think he's the most wonderful father in the world.
At least he was.
Oh, Judy, we can't let this happen.
Not to your home.
I have an idea. Now, today when you go home, be sure that you...
[MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO]
[QUIET MUSIC PLAYING
ON RADIO]
Judy, what are you doing?
Oh, just making things more comfortable for him.
I mean, Father.
Well, that's very nice, I'm sure.
You really should do something about your hair.
- My hair?
- Father would think it looks dreadful.
Please sit down.
As long as the dinner is good, your father won't notice my hair.
It's terribly important to a man how a womars hair looks.
It's important to your father how his food tastes.
You spend too much time in the kitchen.
You should appeal more to his aesthetic senses than to his stomach.
Oh, you don't know your father.
No, I guess I don't.
But then who does?
Mother, what shade of lipstick are you using?
Let me see, I think the clerk called it Soft Rose Number 3.
- Soft Rose?
- Or was it Number 4?
What you should use is Flaming Folly.
It does things for you.
Yes, I'm sure I would, Judy.
I'll bite my lips for tonight.
- Mother?
- Mm?
- Do you have a black nightgown?
- Judy Foster.
What is this all about?
Oh, nothing,
I've just been reading a book.
A book on how to have a happy peaceful home.
Randolph? Do you have to be so noisy?
What did you do to your hair, Mom?
It looks awful.
You keep out of this.
Mother's hair looks simply beautiful.
- And it does things for her.
- Yes, I can feel it does.
- Randolph!
- Now what?
Stay out of it. That's for Father.
And when Father gets home, be glad to see him.
And act with a little charm for once.
Sure, sure,
I'll be just like Walter Pidgeon.
Or would you rather have me be Clark Gable?
Walter Pidgeon would be fine.
Oh, and when Father cracks a joke, laugh whether it's funny or not. Just laugh.
Oh, that's asking a good deal, Judy.
[SINGING] Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me...
Nightingale, could you sing something else?
Yeah, I can sing "John Browrs Body
Lies A-Moldering in the Dust."
No, but not to try to sing so loud.
What is the use of singing if you don't sing loud?
[SINGING]
Swing low, sweet chariot
Two minutes till 6. Dinner ready yet?
JUD Y: Gramps?
- Eh?
Gramps, tonight when you say grace at dinner...
...would you mention something about home is where the heart is?
Sure thing, Judy. Sure thing.
Nightingale, Nightingale.
There's Father's car.
Randolph, Mother, come on down here.
Randolph, laugh at Father's jokes.
And, Mother, don't you forget to kiss Father hello.
Let's all sing.
[SINGING]
Mid pleasures and palaces
Though we may roam
Be it ever so humble
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
Oh, there's no place like home
Well, greetings, everybody, greetings.
- Hello, Melvin.
- Hello, Dora.
Father.
- Well.
- Hello, pater.
Hey, what's going on around here, anyway?
Dora, you look awfully funny.
- You sure you're feeling well?
- Oh, Father.
It's just a new hair dress, Melvin.
Judy didn't care for the old one.
Oh, like I always say, hair today and gone tomorrow.
Now, wait a minute. Somebody's up to some mischief around here.
Oh, we're just in high spirits.
After all, tomorrow is the big day.
So it is. And do you know what else is going to happen tomorrow?
What else is going to happen?
You'd like to know, wouldn't you, huh?
- You're going to increase my allowance?
- Randolph.
I'm going to surprise you all.
A surprise?
Melvin, how wonderful. I adore surprises.
Yes, sir. A surprise to end all surprises.
Another one?
Oh, no. They're very good, though,
Mr. Andrews. Very Good.
You've been doing this sort of thing,
I presume, for some time?
No, just for a couple of days, in fact.
I see.
Going to make this your lifework?
No.
Got something else to do, is that it?
- Yes.
- What?
Look, Jameson...
...as a private investigator, you couldn't get a job on a soap opera.
Yes, sir. I suppose you're right.
- Who sent you?
- Oh, I'm not at liberty to tell, sir.
- It couldn't be Carol's father, could it?
- Yes, sir. I mean no, sir.
Yes, sir.
Why should Mr. Pringle care how long I've been mixing malted milks?
JAMESON:
After all, Carol's his only daughter.
He has to be careful of the kind of people she becomes involved with.
STEPHEN: Go on.
- Well, it's just a routine sort of thing.
He's naturally interested in, shall we say, your background.
Yes, let's do.
You can understand his feelings on the matter.
His daughter's welfare would be his first concern.
It would, eh?
Take care of him, Pop. I'll be right back.
Mr. Pringle is busy and can't be disturbed.
Perhaps this afternoon he'll talk to you.
Would you please tell Mr. Pringle
I wish to speak to him.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Just tell him Stephen I. Andrews is here.
Mr. Stephen Andrews is here, sir.
LUCIEN:
Not now, I'm busy.
WOMAN: But he's already on his way in,
Mr. Pringle.
LUCIEN:
It's customary to knock before you enter.
I didn't know you were interested in courtesies or I would have knocked.
Now, just a moment.
What is it you want?
I wanna save you a little time and expense.
My name is Stephen I. Andrews.
I weigh 1 70 pounds and my health is excellent.
I spent two years in college, three years in the Navy.
I'm working my way through school to become a doctor.
- That's fine.
- I believe in God. I believe in my country.
And I don't think the younger generatiors going to the dogs.
I play a good game of tennis.
My swimming gets by.
- Well, that's...
- My parents were born in Missouri...
...and have lived there for 46 years.
Unless they've done something in the past two weeks...
...to disgrace the name of Andrews, you'll find them respectable people...
...who have an interest in what their sons are doing.
And if you'll excuse my saying so, sir, if you'd do the same thing...
...you wouldn't send your butler out asking silly questions...
...because you'd know yourself what was going on.
Now, any further questions, Mr. Pringle?
Yes, I have.
Just what is your interest in my daughter?
She's one of the most beautiful, spoiled egotistical girls I've ever had to meet.
Now that I've met you,
I understand better why she is as she is.
- Anything else?
- That's enough.
Then good day, sir.
Mr. Pringle, what are you doing home?
What's surprising about coming to dinner?
Why, nothing, sir. Nothing.
Did you say dinner?
Yes. Now, whatever's prepared, make it for three.
Yes, sir, three.
And tell my family
I want to see them in the library.
Yes, sir.
And I've got something to say to you too later.
Yes, sir.
You see...
...I realized I haven't been a very good father and...
Good evening, Father.
Good evening, Carol. Good evening.
You look lovely tonight, Carol.
You really do.
And you've grown too.
You certainly have.
Wort you come in and sit down?
OGDEN:
Good evening, Father.
Oh, Ogden, my boy.
Come in, come in.
Sit down, sit down.
You know, I thought perhaps we might...
...have a little sort of family get-together before dinner.
It won't take long.
Sort of get acquainted with one another.
You know, it's just wonderful to be home with one's family.
Just wonderful.
Father, I thought you had a board of directors' meeting tonight.
Well, to tell you the truth, I did, but I decided they could meet without me.
You see, I think my family should come first.
Ogden, I've been thinking.
How would you like to go on a fishing trip up in the mountains?
Just the two of us.
We could cook our own meals.
Of course, they probably won't be very good. I was never much of a cook.
But I might be a lot of fun.
Don't you think so, son?
Well, yes, sir.
If you say so, sir.
Ogden, you know that "sir" sort of frightens me.
Do you think maybe you could say "Dad"?
Yes, sir. Dad.
Say, I have an idea. How do you feel about seeing a show tonight?
We could make it a party. Ogden...
Oogie, you might call Judy.
Nice girl, Judy. She might like to go along.
Oh, no, I can't call her.
You see, we've separated.
Well, of course, if that's the way you feel about her, it's all right with me.
How about you, Carol?
I've been thinking about that young man,
Stephen.
Seems like a fine young man.
Good qualities.
Of course, I realize you're a little young...
...but I would have no objections if after a while you...
Why don't you phone him?
Maybe he'd like to go to the show with us.
I'd rather not.
I'm sure Stephen has no interest in me whatsoever.
Nor I in him.
Oh, well, of course if that's the way you feel about him, Carol...
...it's perfectly all right with me.
Father, did something go wrong at the office today?
No, no, everything's fine.
Dinner is served.
Thank you. Thank you, Jameson.
Will you excuse me?
I'll be right with you.
Of course, dear. Come on, son.
Oh, Judy...! Oh.
- Hello.
- Hello, Judy?
Something frightening's just happened.
Father came home to dinner.
Yes.
He isn't acting a bit normal.
And that isn't all.
He practically came right out and said it was time I was getting married.
I think he wants to get rid of me.
Carol, I know just how you feel.
I think Father's trying to get rid of me too.
At dinnertime, he kept telling me what a wonderful young man Oogie is.
Yes, he did.
Parents are such great responsibilities.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
OGDEN [SINGING]:
In my heart
There's only room for Judaline
I've seen orchids
Try to bloom like Judaline
Judaline
Golden hair and an angel face
Spring for me is in her embrace
What a glow
To know that she is mine
Ain't she divine?
Beautiful to look at
Are my Judy's eyes
Bright as stars
When only two are in the sky
When there's Judy, there's melody
While there's Judy, there's love for me
And the sun will shine
Judaline
Judaline
Hey, Judy. Judy, I gotta talk to you.
Whatever you have to say can keep till morning.
No, it can't. I gotta see you right away.
For heavers sakes, go on down and talk to him.
All right, Father.
Okay, thanks, fellas.
You can go home now.
And don't make any noise.
This is the silliest thing I ever heard of.
Oogie, it isn't that I didn't enjoy the song.
It was very nice.
But did you have to wake up the whole neighborhood with it?
Gee, I'm sorry, Judy.
I had to see you, though, to say goodbye.
Goodbye? Well, where you going?
Going on a fishing trip with my father.
But what about the radio show?
You mean, I shouldn't leave?
I don't care if you leave or not.
If you wanna walk out on a business deal, you go ahead.
I shouldn't expect loyalty from you, anyway.
Judy Foster, I've been loyal and true to you for years.
Ever since the first time I met you and you ran over me with your tricycle.
And you've been running over me ever since.
But things have changed.
I've grown up.
And when you grow up and can quit acting like a child, call me.
I may be waiting for you and I may not.
And in the meantime, I have many important things to take care of.
One of them is to go on a fishing trip with my dad.
We're going alone, just the two of us.
And we don't need any women around to tells us what we can and what we can't do.
I maybe back in time for the radio show and I may not.
So good night, Judy, and goodbye.
Attaboy, Oogie, that's the way to talk to them.
Always keep the upper hand.
I don't know which one is more middle-aged.
You'll be the sensation tonight, Mr. Foster.
I'm so glad for you, so glad.
Well, I'm happy
I don't have to earn a living doing that.
It's much easier selling fish.
Well, you do it for a living, it is like selling fish.
Hope that you're not late for your rehearsal...
...and that Mr. Cugat won't be angry with you.
Cugie, angry?
Oh, no, he never gets angry.
He's sweet and kind just like you,
Mr. Foster.
Always a gentleman.
He's gentle as a kitten.
- And we'll be married pretty soon.
- No.
- Yes.
- Isn't that wonderful.
Well, I hope your married life is as happy as mine has been.
It will be. If it's not,
I hit Cugie right on the head.
Yes, Mr. Foster?
Miss Rosita and I are going to the hotel for the wedding-anniversary dinner tonight.
- You can take the rest of the day off.
- Thank you, Mr. Foster. I'd love to.
- Good luck. And congratulations.
- Thank you ever so much.
I'm going home to tell Mother.
Oh, no, Judy, you mustrt do that.
Not on the day of her wedding anniversary.
In fact, I'm not sure you should ever tell her.
Maybe somehow there's been a mistake.
Maybe.
There's no mistake.
I think she has a right to know.
Then at least wait until after the party tonight.
All right.
Carol, you won't hold of this against me.
Of course not, Judy.
Who knows?
I may be coming to you with the same kind of problem.
So my Rosita, my dove, my little pigeon, the light of my life, she's late again, eh?
You think you're so good you don't have to come to rehearsal, no?
[SPEAKING IN SPANISH]
Cugie, he's just a little bit upset.
Just a little.
And don't go away.
He does not stay angry long.
I'll show you.
Now, you're not going to stay angry long with your baby?
Well, I'll forgive you.
This last time I forgive you.
But you better don't forget a single word of your song.
You see? His bite is worst than his bark.
Now I rehearse my song, then you talk about your dinner tonight, huh?
There.
Nice.
Pancho, go down with eight and come up with the downbeat.
[SINGING]
I love the Latin music of Señor Cugat
He's got the kind of a zip
That only a few got
The music is romantic
The music is exciting
But I like a little better what you got
Not Cugat, but what you got
Not Cugat, but what you got
Ahh...
That's the kind of the music. I like it.
It talks to my skin.
I'm a jitterbug and I'm hot as a pipe
I want to tell you, brother
I'm the bobby-sock type
I'm a red tomato and I'm overly ripe
I'm cooking with gas
I got a mellow fellow
And he's right on the track
And I'm so tutti-fruitti
That I holler, "Hey, Mack"
Beats me up, Barry
And I'll beat you right back
I'm cooking with gas
Dig, dig, dig, deep right in the grove
Then send me boy with a boot and a boat
I got some fish in my food
I don't know what the heck
That I'm talking about
I'm an alligator and I'm sharp as a bug
I like to boogie-woogie
Like to chew up a rug
I'm very, very groove
And I'm a hot chili pep
I'm cooking with gas
Oh, Dig, dig, dig, deep right in the grove
Then send me boy with a boot and a boat
I've got some fish in my food
I don't know what the heck
That I'm talking about
- Do you like it?
- Yes, I like it
- Do you dig me?
- Yes, I dig you
- Is it murder?
- Sure, it's murder
- Will you swing it?
- Yes, I will
I'm the zootiest chick this side of Brazil
Yes, sir.
DORA:
Come in.
Oh, Judy, dear, come in.
Will you please excuse us?
I'd like to talk to Mother alone.
I'm practically downstairs right now,
Miss Judy.
My, oh, my.
Doesrt she look just like a bride to be?
Thank you, Nightingale.
- Mother?
- Hm?
Do you love Father very much?
Very much, Judy.
Very, very much.
When a woman loves a man terribly...
...and finds out that he doesn't love her like she thought he did...
...what happens then, Mom?
Well, at my age it might very well be a tragedy.
But at your age, honey, it's just all part of growing up.
Learning about people, learning about a lot of things.
Whatever problem you have, we'll work out together.
Now, this is no time to be sad.
We're all going out to dinner and have a grand time, aren't we?
- Of course we are, but this is much...
- Ready, Dora?
- Practically ready, Melvin.
- Good evening, Father.
Oh, such formality.
Good evening, Miss Foster.
Will we do?
I'm looking at the two most beautiful women in the world.
- Thanks, Melvin.
- Thank you, Father.
Judy, I want to speak to your mother just a few minutes alone.
I'll be waiting outside if you need me, Mother.
All right, dear.
Dora, I'm a little bit worried about Judy.
She's been acting very strange the past week.
I just bumped into her a few minutes ago...
...and she looked at me and shook her head.
I thought she want to tell me something, then she ran away.
She's probably trying to make up her mind between Stephen and Oogie.
And, Melvin...
...your letting her make her own decision as you're doing is wonderful.
Judy will be all right.
I think she likes living here.
You know something, Dora?
I do too.
- There. You look really sharp, Gramps.
- You really think so, Randolph?
Sure. I bet you were a jim-dandy when you were a young guy.
Well, I never had any complaints.
Randolph? Gramps?
I have something to say of the utmost importance.
Something that may change our whole lives.
- You gonna run for president?
- This is no time for jokes, Randolph.
- Oh, what is it, Judy girl?
- Well, just remember one thing if you will.
Whatever happens this evening, we must be patient and understanding.
We must stick together.
Please remember.
My sister used to be a normal human being.
Now she's in love.
Never criticize anyone for being in love,
Randolph.
It's a mighty important institution.
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
I take great pleasure in presenting to you...
...our very talented, lovely and beautiful singer...
...Señorita Rosita Conchellas.
[SINGING]
We gotta get going
Where are we going?
What are we gonna do?
We're on our way to somewhere
But only me and you
All we see there, who we'll see there
What a very big surprise
There may be caballeros
With dark and flashing eyes
We're on our way
Pick up your pack
And if we stay
We won't come back
How can we go?
We haven't got a dime
But we're going
And you're gonna have happy time
Now, someone said
They just come back from somewhere
A friend of mine that I don't even know
He said there's lot of fun
If we can get there
If that's the case
That's the place
The place we want to go
We gotta get going, where we going?
The nerve of her. How dare she?
How dare she?
And in front of Mother too.
Who we'll see there, who will be there
What a very big surprise
There maybe caballeros
With dark and flashing eyes
I'll take the train
You take the boat
Or I'll take the plane
And you ride the boat
Oh, we don't care
We rather walk or climb
But we're going
And you're gonna have a happy time
Melvin, she seems to know you.
Oh, yes, I get around quite a bit.
- We've got a great big secret, Dora.
- Did somebody say, "Let's eat"?
Nobody did, Gramps, but it's a good idea.
Hello, girls, did you want to see me?
Never mind being polite.
- You ought to be ashamed.
- Ashamed of what?
Running around with a man old enough to be your father.
It is my business who I choose to run around with.
- You run around with a married man.
- A married man with children.
- Just a minute, did you say married?
- Yes, married and with two children.
- Grown children.
- Two children?
You're breaking up a wonderful family and a happy home.
It was a happy home.
You wait in here.
Don't go away.
There, sit down.
Now you tell him what you just told me.
Go on, tell him.
Go on. Okay, then I tell him.
You big good-for-nothing unfaithful lug.
Why don't tell me you're married?
And have two children. Grown children.
What do you mean, married?
I am not married.
I don't have two children of any kind.
What is this all about?
We didn't mean you, Mr. Cugat.
We were talking about Mr. Foster.
Mr. Foster? Mr. Foster, eh?
- My father.
- Her father.
Werert you at his office this week?
And hiding in his closet?
- Well, were you?
- Of course I was.
I mean, I was teaching him to rumba.
In a closet?
Oh, I see.
You thought... Oh, my.
I was teaching your father to rumba as a surprise for you and your mother tonight.
What?
Oh, I'm afraid we made a terrible mistake, Miss Rosita.
Oh, please forgive us, Mr. Cugat.
I forgive you.
You I wanna talk to.
And as for Mr. Foster, he better know how to do the rumba.
I guess I better apologize to my father.
I think the less said the better.
Might as well go back now.
Just a minute, Carol. I believe we have some unfinished business.
Now that my faith in men has been restored...
...what's this about you and Stephen?
Stephen? Well, I don't know.
That is, not exactly.
Well, exactly what does "not exactly" mean?
I mean that Stephen isn't interested in me.
Not even a little bit.
Well, then, if he isn't interested in you,
Carol, maybe he could be interested in me.
I think he might be.
- Shall we join the others?
- Mm-hm.
I should have known all the time my father was fatherly.
Dora, I don't like to mention this...
...but don't you think you should brush up on your rumba a little bit?
Tell me, how did you manage to keep this a secret from the children and me?
No trouble at all. It was easy.
In fact, they used to call me
"Foxy Foster."
Excuse me, Carol.
Evening, Oogie.
- Oh, good evening.
- Hi.
There's something
I wish to discuss with you.
Oh, of course. Go right ahead.
I thought you'd like to know that I've changed.
I'm not the same Judy Foster you knew yesterday.
Well, you look the same to me.
I've decided to take you back.
Frankly, Miss Foster,
I don't want you back.
Oogie Pringle, you listen to me.
First you want me, then you don't want me.
Now that I want you to want me, you don't want me. Make up your mind.
- I have made up my mind.
- He has made up his mind.
- Mitzi, you keep out of it.
- I don't have to.
- You keep out...
- Girls, girls, please be calm.
You'll find someone someday, Judy.
Good evening, Mr. Pringle.
Oh, Oogie. Oogie, you're so right.
I hope you two will be very happy.
Oh, Oogie,
I didn't know you cared for me.
Oh, don't talk to me.
I'm confused.
Good evening, Stephen, Mr. Pringle.
- Judy, Is my daughter here?
- She's right over there.
- Will you excuse me?
- Oh, I certainly will.
Will you dance with me, Stephen?
The situatiors desperate.
Of course I'll dance with you, Judy.
May I join you?
Please do.
What would you say if I told you
I had the prettiest...
...and nicest daughter in the whole world?
I guess I'd be so happy...
...I don't know what to say.
Then don't say anything.
- Would you like to dance?
- No, thank you.
In fact, I think I'd like to go home.
I wish you'd do me a favor.
I'd like you to stay, just a little while.
Just as you say, Dad.
Where are you going?
I have something very important to take care of.
[CLEARS THRO AT]
Ladies and gentlemen...
...we have a young lady here with us tonight...
As a matter of fact, she's just a little more than 1 6.
- who will sing a song in honor of her mother and father...
...who are celebrating their 20th wedding anniversary.
Miss Judy Foster.
This is the final insult.
Don't forget, Judy, this is a celebration for your mother and dad.
May I?
Havert you forgotten something?
Maybe.
I'm spoiled and egotistical.
That's right.
Maybe I'll get used to you, say in...
Well, say in a few years. You think so?
If you don't, it will be all your fault.
That's all right. I'll take that chance.
I forgive you for everything.
[SINGING]
It's a most unusual day
It's like catching a bridal bouquet
It's like reaching the moon
Or composing a tune
It's a most unusual day
All the world is bursting with song
And I feel like I really belong
It's like finding a friend
Having money to spend
It's a most unusual day
There are people greeting people
There is sunshine everywhere
There are people greeting people
And a feeling of spring in the air
It's a most unusual time
I keep feeling my temperature climb
If my heart won't behave
In the usual way
Then there's only one thing to say
It's the most unusual
Most unusual
Most unusual day
[ENGLISH SDH]
I have telephoned all over Brussels for you.
What kind of a husband are you to desert your wife like this?
I walked from the office by way of the park.
And while you walked in the park
I had to send for Dr. Renee.
Because you're ill?
No, Mr. Dodd had a letter from the papers from London.
A boarder gets a letter, so, you send for the doctor?
I thought he'd go insane!
He threw his piano over on the floor.
Tore up his music. All of it.
The work of a year.
Good. We shall not hear it again.
He shouted out loud that he was no longer a composer.
I would have shouted it to him long before...
...if boarders were easy to find.
He said he was no longer a composer, but a mechanic.
A mechanic? Maybe he is.
I'll go up.
Tell me, my dear doctor, do you know the difference...
...between a consonance and a dissonance?
I'm a doctor of medicine, not a doctor of music.
I don't like doctors,
I don't need doctors.
-What do you need, Mr. Dodd?
-Nothing. I have everything.
This is very inconvenient.
I have patients at the hospital.
-Why am I here?
-Why are any of us here, doctor?
I don't know why we're here now...
...but I know why you won't be here tomorrow.
Marie and I will require this room.
Georges, you will consult me about that.
I've decided!
The house is in my charge!
That is my piano and this is my chair!
Is there any insanity in your family, Mr. Dodd?
I have no family, how could I have any insanity in it?
My dear doctor,
I'd like to pay you, to thank you and say good-bye.
It is my opinion that you are much more than slightly mad.
-Thank you, doctor.
-Adieu.
Good-bye.
Before you put that money back, will you glance at this piano?
It's broken.
Can no one be right but me?
What would calm you, Mr. Dodd?
I don't know.
Brandy will not calm you.
And you're smoking all the time.
-You received something from England.
-Oh, yes, from London.
As you know, my symphony was presented at Regents Hall in London last week.
-Remember?
-Yes, it was very strange music.
Did you ever tell me it was strange?
You heard it?
-We heard it so many times.
-I see.
And it made you uncomfortable.
-Oh, no, no...
-Yes, why should we be afraid?
Georges is right, listen to this.
This is the foremost music critic in London:
"It is inconceivable to this critic..."
"...that a program as delicately conceived as this..."
"...should be mire by the rude intrusion of uncomfortable dissonance."
They were uncomfortable, Georges, and so were you.
It must be that I was uncomfortable and I conveyed it through my music.
But, we try to make you comfortable here.
You worked for a whole year!
That's right, a year, to become a mechanic. Listen to this:
"However, it is to be considered that Mr. Dodd,"
"the brilliant, young,
Belgium modernist,"
has accomplished a series of tonal mechanics."
Now, you see?
I am a mechanic!
-There was another foreign letter.
-I didn't see it.
Yes, two of them.
One from London and one from Switzerland.
Switzerland? The Sangers!
-What about dinner, Marie?
-What about dinner, Marie?
Every Christmas, when you go to the Sanger, you come back so changed and so gay.
Well, I've known them since they were babies.
I've seen them grow up.
Your Dr. Renee should meet them.
There he would find insanity of the most enchanting kind.
Good place for you to go.
-Oh, Georges, please...
What about dinner, Marie?
Ah, poor Sanger.
-Mr. Dodd.
-Mm?
You remember you wrote a song for the Sanger children?
-A little song?
-Mm-hmm, but you did not send it.
Oh, that. It was too sad.
They're so gay, I threw it away.
No, I found it in the rubbish.
-Here it is.
-You did! Look.
Cello for Kate.
She's the eldest.
Violin for Paula. Little Paula, she's the youngest.
Piano for Toni...
...and viola for Tessa, the pick of the bunch.
And the mother?
They all have different mothers, except Paula and Tessa.
Yes, these two share the same mother.
And what has Mr. Sanger besides children and all their mothers?
A genius for music and a new Russian wife.
-He's rich?
-Tremendously rich.
So much so, sometimes he hasn't got enough money to buy food.
Yet, they live in a chalet in Switzerland.
Yes, a beautiful dilapidated spot.
I must go there tonight,
I can't wait.
Give Georges a hug, a kiss and tell him not to be angry.
And ask him to send a telegram for me, to Albert Sanger.
Here's the address.
"Arriving Wednesday, kill a pig and buy some decent brandy. Lewis."
Thank you, Marie.
What's the matter, Roberto?
What is it?
"Arriving Wednesday, kill a pig and buy some decent brandy. Lewis."
My God, I've been swimming and
I got my hair wet! Oh...!
Kate!
Kate! Kate!
-You'll wake your father.
-He's coming! Lewis is coming!
He says: "kill a pig a buy some decent brandy"!
There, yeah, brandy.
-For Mr. Sanger.
-Give it to me.
I'll get his room ready with some lovely flowers--
No, we have another guest coming, a Mr... Mr. Trigorin.
He must have that room and--
Lewis must go to the stable loft.
Oh, God, I got my hair wet--
It'll dry in the sun!
Get Paula, you'll both help me with the rooms.
Paula!
Paula!
Quiet, you'll wake your father.
Who cares?
You've broken my spine,
I suppose you know that.
-Lewis is coming.
-When?
Any minute.
That ribbon happens to belong to me.
-Where's mine?
-I don't know.
Hurry up if you want to come to meet Lewis.
He'll be here any minute!
I don't want to stay here with you, you drunken...
...pig! Drunken pig!
He's a drunken pig.
It's my father you're talking about.
My husband.
Kate!
-Kate, any coffee apart?
-Please, Lina--
Tessa, take this up to father...
...and tell him about Lewis and Mr. Trigorin.
-Lend me that ribbon, will you?
-Your hair is pretty without it.
-You had stomach-ache yesterday.
-It's better today.
Here, fasten me up.
-What's the matter with you, Tessa?
-Lewis is coming!
I've got my hair wet and
I can't find my ribbon!
-Where is it?
-I don't know.
-Here, take this one.
-Thank you, Kate, I'll return it.
Take this and don't drop it.
-What about Lewis' brandy?
-I put out half of it. Go on!
Who's there?
It's Tessa, father.
I'm afraid you'll have to add a little water.
Roberto could only get one bottle.
We owe so much.
Lewis Dodd's coming today.
He sent us a telegram.
Lewis Dodd, yes, I--
I wrote to him.
Father, would you do me a favor?
What?
Would you let me trim your hair up a bit?
Lewis will think no one takes care of you.
-No!
-Oh, come on, please.
What're you going to call it?
"A Little Girl Cutting
Her Father's Hair".
No, no!
-Father?
-Uh?
-Would you tell me something?
-Mm-hmm.
Is Lewis Dodd a really very fine musician?
Good technique.
He's like the weather.
Today is thunders, tomorrow is sunny.
Like children playing.
But there's no blood pulsing through his music, no heart.
It's the new school that's coming in.
If he'd only cry.
He ever really laughs,
I'm sure he couldn't cry.
If he'd fall in love, if some woman could disturb him.
I'm sure he's never known a woman.
If he could suffer, that's what I mean.
What would make him suffer?
I don't know.
That's something that happens to all of us.
Father, listen.
It's Lewis!
He's here!
Paula!
Paula, come on!
Didn't you hear Lewis?
Lewis Dodd!
Lewis Dodd!
-You're actually here!
-How are you, darling?
Hello, Tessa!
I've been swimming,
I've got my hair wet.
I wish you kids would stop growing.
You make me feel very old!
You're growing up like sting weeds.
That's not very nice of you, Lewis.
Oh! What have you got there?
And those beautiful bags?
That's Mr. Trigorin.
The bags are his.
-Where did you find him?
-He's come to visit your father.
Mr. Trigorin staged a ballet from one of your father's operas.
You are the charming daughters of Mr. Sanger?
This is Paula.
And this-- this here is Tessa, the pick of the bunch.
Girls, welcome your guest, please.
He looks like a flea trainer.
-Welcome.
-How long will you stay?
See what I mean, Mr. Trigorin?
They're charming little ladies.
-Ah, signore!
-Roberto, nice to see you!
Please, bring up these bags, will you?
Oh, where is Toni?
-No, Tessie, you can't tell it.
-Of course, I can.
Lewis is part of this house.
Arent'you, Lewis?
What're you talking about?
Where's Toni?
Toni went to Zurich and she wrote us a postcard.
She said she was staying with friends only, we don't believe it.
Father's furious and says he'll beat her when she gets back--
Wait, wait, one at a time.
You mean our mad little Toni...
...has become a "bad little Toni"?
Yes, and we think Fritz Bercovy is at the bottom of it.
-We don't know, we're very upset.
-Who's Bercovy?
Fritz Bercovy, he's very rich, he owns ten theatres now.
-Oh, little Fritz...
-It's very disturbing, Lewis!
-Yes, I know. She'll be back.
-We hope so...
-Oh, good morning, dear Lina!
-Madame Sanger.
Yes, sorry, Mme. Sanger.
-I've got a gift for you.
-A gift?
A beautiful and plump one.
It's waiting for you on the patio.
-His name is Trigorin.
-Oh, Trigorin!
I know him from
Saint Petersburg. Trigorin!
She's driving Sanger mad.
I think he'd be glad...
-...if she left him.
-I don't know about that.
Children, please.
-Where do I sleep?
-In the loft.
Mr. Trigorin has the guest room.
-Only if you'd take the other bed.
-With a flea trainer?
On the loft!
-May we help you--?
-No, darling, I'm sorry...
...but I'm dead.
I'm going to sleep.
Oh, if Sanger calls me, wake me...
-...but gently.
-Yes, I will.
Here, let me do your hair.
Sanger said today that Lewis was like the weather.
That if he never really cried, he'd never be really great.
What do you think could make him cry?
He must've been in love and cried about that.
-He's never been in love.
-How do you know?
He may know a lot of things but...
...he's never known real love any more than we have.
-How do you know?
-I know.
There're things nobody has to tell you about, you just know.
The way you moon over him is enough to turn one's stomach.
I love Lewis, he's mine.
Do you think he knows about it?
I don't think he knows now, but...
...one day, he'll look at me and he'll say:
"Darling, darling Tessa..."
And everything'll be all right.
-And you'll faint.
-Into his arms, probably.
And he'll be very glad because he needs someone like me.
-Will you keep house for him?
-Of course I will.
Nobody on earth could be more untidy than you.
Yes, except Lewis, so, it'll be all right.
Shall you be engaged or just married?
I'll be his very own wife and love him as long as I live.
-Look, Tess, Toni!
-Where?
-Come on!
-Toni's back!
Toni!
Toni!
Toni!
Where did you get that hat?
-Hello, Tessa.
-Toni, you're b-- you're back.
-Of course, I'm back.
-Lewis is here.
-Lewis? Where?
-In the loft.
Kate!
Kate, Toni's back!
Toni's back!
-Hello!
-Hello, darling!
Kate, I'm back.
So I see.
If everyone's going to look like that, I'm going.
Toni, may I ask what is upon your head?
-The latest style. Zurich.
-Zurich? Oh!
-For a whole week!
-Did you have a good time?
I had a lovely time.
Anything I said I wanted,
Fritz got it for me.
-Fritz? Fritz Bercovy?
-Fritz, yes!
We had lovely meals.
-Not at Fritz's house?
-Of course not.
At the Splendid, the best hotel.
Last night we had asparagus, and lobsters...
-...and iced bombes and peaches...
-Did it make you sick?
Fritz had a saddle of mutton and we had champagne.
We had champagne every night.
Did he buy you that hat?
No, I bought it with my own money.
-Do you like it, Lewis?
-Superb.
It's large, but it suits you.
What have you done to your hair?
-I had it dressed.
-Lovely.
-Sanger says he'll beat you.
-What will you tell him?
-The truth.
-What is the truth, Toni?
Anything you'd prefer to think if that amuses you.
I know I did nothing to be ashamed of.
Oh, we're all quite sure of that.
Fritz bought me a dozen pairs of stokings.
All silk, every shade.
You took clothes from him, how common.
Wrong, I threw them out the window.
-I asked him what he took me for.
-Good for you, Toni.
They got caught on the telephone wires.
People in the street looked so surprised!
It was windy and they waved like little flags.
I laughed so hard I nearly fell out of the window myself!
-Fritz hated to see his money wasted.
-You sound as if you hated him.
I don't hate him.
I made him understand he was mistaken about me.
I was so hurt...
...because I--
I really thought he liked me decently.
Don't cry, Toni.
We knew nothing could happen to you.
But you're home now, and we love you.
Oh, Toni, darling.
No man is worth a single one of your tears.
Come, Toni.
Toni, don't cry.
Don't worry about Toni.
-Are you sure she's all right?
-I'm sure she is.
Thanks.
-Sanger's awake now.
-Good. I'll talk to him.
Hey, Lewis, don't tell us you've been working!
-For the little girls Sanger only.
-Little girls...
When I make a promise
I keep it.
Composed specially for the Sanger circus. You see,
I made it very simple, so that you'd have no difficulty in playing it.
-Isn't it rather sad?
-No comments from you.
Learn it. I'm going to your father.
"When thou art dead, the birds will stop their singing."
-It doesn't sound like Lewis at all.
-It's a nice melody.
"When thou art dead, the birds will stop their singing."
"When thou art cold, no sun will ever rise."
-Come on, let's learn it!
-"No more, no more..."
"...the joyful days upspringing shall bless these eyes."
"When thou art in the grave the flowers blowing..."
"...shall hang their heads..."
Sanger?
-Where have you been?
-Waiting for you to wake up.
Pull that shutter, too.
If that mountain could be moved...
...the sun wouldn't come blinding in here all day.
Where would you like it moved to?
Over my grave.
I'd like a mountain for a monument.
What would I print for an epitaph?
Pull up a chair.
About the epitaph, let it just say...
..."Albert Sanger, a dirty old man."
No, no, I would say...
..."Albert Sanger, musician and genius."
And then, if you like,
I could add...
"He was, also, a dirty old man."
No, thanks.
Tell me,
-What about your concert in London?
-It didn't go.
As the English say, it flopped.
It made them uncomfortable.
Oh, by the way, your daughter
Toni is back.
Antonia? Oh, yes, she went--
Did she tell you were she went?
Yes, yes, and she was completely innocent, I'm sure of that.
What's going to happen to the children when I'm gone?
Lewis, I'm helpless.
I haven't got 20 pounds.
Didn't Paula's and Tessa's mother have people in England?
Oh, yes.
When I ran out with their daughter,
Evelyn Creighton, their mother, the Creighton family disowned her.
There was a time when her brother,
Charles, hunted us all over Europe.
His idea was to shoot me on sight, the American fashion, and take the sister Evelyn back.
Then, the children came.
He gave up the hunting, forgot us.
But this brother, Charles, still alive?
You know this kind of people.
Good old Boston type.
Lewis, if anything happened to me, look up for this Creighton family.
They're very rich, get them to do something for the children.
-They should go to school.
-I know, I know.
Oh, by the way, you've got a guest.
-Trigorin.
-Keep him away from me!
Little monkeys.
-What is that music?
-Mine, I'm afraid.
Just a trifle I brought for the children.
You mean, you wrote it?
It's nothing at all.
Leave the door open,
I want to listen to it.
Sugar candy.
It's very nice.
Nice, yes... nice.
You're ashamed of melody, aren't you?
No, I have no gift for it.
Shut that door.
If you'd done that in London you wouldn't have failed.
What?
-That is me?
-That is you.
Oh, if I could only make you understand.
What would I make of it?
A love scene in an opera!
A symphonic poem, what you will!
Go away, and tell Kate to bring me some more brandy.
Mr. Bercovy, don't try to explain.
It's a disgrace.
Toni is a child!
But-but, please, madame, try to understand me, I--
Madame, you're laboring on a misapprehension!
We know all about it, Fritz!
Lewis! It's so nice to see you.
Hello, Fritz, you look very well!
Lewis, from man to man,
I must see Antonia.
From man to man, I doubt that she will see you.
-No?
-You see, she's a little hurt.
My boy, the next time you ask a young lady to Zurich...
...pick somenone less sophisticated than the Sanger ladies.
Fritzie, I'm surprised at you!
But, Lewis, honestly, from man to man,
I had no bad intentions.
I'm very fond of Toni.
So are we all.
Remember that, Mr. Bercovy.
Hey, there! What's the matter?
This is terrible. Sanger said it was a very nice little piece.
-It is charming!
-Really?
-What's he doing at the piano?
-He plays.
Yes! Trigorin plays very well for a flea trainer.
A flea trainer?
Paula, please!
-He knows, we told him.
-Oh, you did.
Very sad, Lewis, but quite playable.
Thank you, Kate.
Sanger said it would make a symphonic poem, but...
...somehow, I can't quite agree with him.
Father instincts are usually right.
Let's try it.
Where's your viola, Tessa?
I learnt it all perfectly and I broke the strings.
Aw... Come on, let's hear it.
Ready?
No, no. Let's get together.
Nice on key. Paula.
"When thou art dead,"
"the birds will stop their singing."
"When thou art cold,"
"no sun will ever rise."
"No more, no more the joyful days upspringing..."
"...shall bless these eyes."
#Ah, say not so...#
Go ahead, sing it.
#When I am in my grave,#
#the flowers blowing shall make thee garlands...#
#...twenty times as sweet.#
Beauty will live.
#Beauty will live...#
#...though I must sleep...#
#...unknowing...#
-Beneath thy feet.
#...beneath thy feet...#
#...beneath thy feet.#
Very pretty, darling.
Tessa!
Tessa!
-Why did you run away like that?
-I don't know.
It's quiet here, isn't it?
Yes, you hear things in this kind of silence.
What do you hear?
-This is where I think out my words.
-Oh, poetry?
-No, just thoughts, I can't explain.
-Tell me one thought.
-You'll laugh.
-No, I won't laugh.
Well, there's so many, but, sad things, like your music.
"I have tonight a quiet desire to die."
"I have no tide of exit note to leave."
"O, in this wound-cut earth to lie,"
"O, if they would not grieve."
"I have tonight a quiet desire."
You liked that?
Oh, it's very pretty, but, you want to die?
I'm not in the least anxious to die.
When I see troubles, I always want to run away from them.
-Then you'd better run away from me.
-Oh, I'll never do that!
Really?
You're such a graceless little baggage.
Strangely innocent.
I've got to talk to you.
-Why?
-Too many Frtizes around.
You know, you've got to be protected.
Protected? But my heart is a very simple heart,
Isn't that some protection?
If you were my little girl, I'd put you in a convent or a school.
I've seen girls in schools, they all have faces like plum puddings.
I'm not a raving beauty, but you wouldn't like me...
-...with a face like a plum pudding.
-I'm thinking for your good.
You don't shut people up in schools for their good.
Supposing I--
I wanted to gaze at the moon one night...
...and I found myself in a dormitory full of pudding faces.
You shouldn't go moon gazing.
-What when I got out of school?
-You'd be a perfect lady!
And would you like me as a perfect lady?
You won't even look at us, my pretty one.
I may go to school, I'm beginning to see points in it.
But I shall always be thinking of you.
No, you must learn quickly to disapprove of me.
I happen to be very fond of you.
Which is a very grave mistake to be fond of anyone.
Why?
Before you know it, you become...
...unselfish, considerate, self-sacrifizing, all those tiresome things.
-Will you remember that?
-Yes, I will.
And don't go getting fond of any unnecessary people.
You can be as fond of us as you like, but--
-but please, don't-- don't--
-Don't what?
Don't go getting married or-- in jail or die, or anything, please.
I'll try no to.
Say: "Cross my heart and hope to die".
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Dear Lewis--
Tessa!
Tessa!
Lewis!
Lewis, quickly!
-What is it, Kate?
-Come up here!
He hasn't been coming out for days.
He was angry, but he--
Let's get him on the bed.
He-- he started to cry, he asked me to hold his hand...
...and then he fell on the floor, on his face.
He cut himself...
He's dead!
He cut his nose!
Don't stay here.
Come, Tessa.
Don't you dare touch him!
Lina!
Look.
"To remind Lewis Dodd of his nice little tune..."
"...a symphonic poem which could be entitled 'Tomorrow' ".
Poor father!
We don't have enough!
Here comes Tessa with more.
Is it one of those things coming on?
-Is it your heart?
-No, I'm a bit winded, that's all.
-You shouldn't run uphills.
-No...
Who's that?
It's Fritzie!
He must have come on the early train!
No, that's his own car.
Fritzie!
-Come on!
-No, you go.
-Why?
I don't want to see that dirty money-grabbing little lad.
Send my breakfast up here while I finish the border floor.
-Oh, Mr. Fritz.
-Roberto.
So the master is gone.
Yes, Mr. Fritz, and not only the master is gone, but the madame, she's gone.
-Really? Dead?
-Unfortunately, no.
She's just gone, with
Mr. Trigorin. You remember?
-Oh, yes.
-And Miss Kate, she's gone to Milano, to study voice.
-Fritz!
-Oh, hello, girls.
I read about it in the papers in Zurich, after the funeral.
-My heart is broken for you.
-Thank you very much, Fritz.
We can now offer you Napoleon brandy scotch whisky and port.
-Yes, and steak and kidney pie.
-And Yorkshire pudding.
We have company.
It's our mother's brother,
Mr. Charles Creichton from England. Our uncle.
And his daughter, Miss Florence
Creichton. They're very rich.
Lewis sent them a letter and said that we were penniless...
...and destined to lead a shameful life. And since...
...his sister was our mother... why, over they came!
They've been here for a week.
Our cousin, she's very swish.
She has a personal maid with her.
Come here.
Her name is Hamilton.
-Yes, Miss?
Ms. Hamilton, would you be so kind as to...
...take Mr. Bercovy's hat and scarf?
Please, don't trouble.
Thank you very much.
-You see?
-Wonderful.
Tell me, Lewis Dodd, is he here?
-He's gone swimming.
-Yes, with our cousin Florence.
-Oh, she's a musician.
-No, she's very beautiful.
And, tell me, where is Toni?
She won't go to England to school either.
She says she wants a job in a cabaret in Paris.
And do nothing but drink champagne, eat a great deal of food and listen to the latest music.
And I tell you she will not!
I'm going to marry her.
-That would be lovely, Fritz.
-Oh, yes, Toni'd love money.
-Good morning, Uncle Charles.
-What?
-I missed him.
-Who've you missed?
Somekind of crow outside my window.
Awful fellow.
Five o' clock this morning, he'd start: caw, caw, caw...
Same yesterday.
I'm going to take measures.
Oh, please, don't shoot anything today, Uncle Charles.
What are you doing?
All right, then, if you say so.
You're like your mother, my sister Evelyn.
We never could get her up to Scotland for shooting.
Well, good morning, my dears.
Good morning.
You keep looking at me.
I don't know who you are.
Strange morning.
Everywhere I look, I find something looking at me.
First, that crow...
...then you.
-That's our great friend.
-Friend?
-He's one of our greatest friends.
-Fritz Bercovy.
-What do you play?
Billiard, rummy, anything you wish.
-Not a musical chap.
-He owns ten theatres.
In the ten most important cities.
You look like the kind of chap that's up to something.
Are you?
Just what are you doing here?
Forgive me but I came to assist in a financial predicament...
-...of the Sanger family.
-It's all done, my boy, all done.
They're going to England and to school.
Thank you very much... sir.
Well, now my breakfast.
-Where's Florence?
-She's gone swimming.
-Really? Robert!
-Oh, it's Roberto.
-Why the "o"?
-It's Italian.
Robert-o!
Breakfast-o!
Florence told me to go and pick some flowers.
-Well, go and pick them, then.
-Come on with me!
-Oh, stop brooding. Come on!
-I'm not brooding.
-You are.
-I'm not.
Come on!
-What's that?
For your father's grave.
Where is it?
It's up the hills.
-Where is Toni?
-I don't know. Find her.
Toni! Fritz is going to marry you!
Florence is very beautiful.
She is beautiful but she is so sure about everything.
You think she is sure of Lewis?
I wouldn't be surprised if she bewitched him.
Poor Tess.
When you love someone as I love Lewis...
...you've just got to understand things.
Florence is only beautiful and she just happens to be here but--
Secrets?
Hello, Florence.
-Did you find any primula?
-No, they grow over by the lake...
...and we didn't have time to get any before breakfast.
We'll get Lewis to raw us over later.
I can't wait to take you to England and buy you some decent clothes.
Well, we don't yet know whether we're sure we want to go.
And I'm not so sure you aren't too young to know what's good for you.
You see, we're too young for some things, we're too old for others,
-we're in between, you know.
-Yes, I've been through that stage.
Hi.
Have you been behaving, girls?
Really, Lewis, sometimes you can be very pompous.
I hope that's put you in your place, Mr. Dodd.
I think we should go and get the flowers.
Get plenty of flowers and put them in a vase in the middle of the table.
-Yes, we know.
-Come on!
Come on.
What's the matter? You have a funny look on your face.
-Funny?
-You're a fool.
The fool is wondering.
You look like a man who's wondered a lot.
Mm-hmm. A little hopelessly
I'm afraid.
From what I've heard of musicians, you're all the same.
Strange and a little off-the-earth.
-I've come to the earth, suddenly.
-Do you like it?
-Do I like you?
-I didn't mean that.
I mean, being on the earth, out of your clouds.
I do, I do like it very much.
But I'd like to take you back to my clouds with me.
When do you leave, sir?
At your word.
This is becoming very pretty and very gallant.
I mean it, very much.
You must've had a great success with this method of approach.
No, I've had no success whatever. Ever.
Poor Mr. Dodd. I'm not going to attempt to believe you.
What woman could resist a trip to the clouds...
-... with someone as...?
-Mm-hmm?
-I'm stumped.
-Oh, you mean, someone who wanted to kiss you the minute you got off that train?
-To kiss?
-Uh-huh.
A beautiful woman gets off the train...
...to rescue some girls, and a poor musician...
...wants to take her into his arms and kiss her.
And they lived happily everafter.
You know they could.
I swear they could.
-I will, I think.
-What?
Live happily.
Florence!
Why do you think I stayed up here this whole week?
I don't know. Why?
Tell me, I want to hear.
I wanted to find my way up to you in your clouds.
See, I'm not exactly the cloudy type.
I didn't know my way until you told me.
You're so real, so definite.
Is that what you like?
It's what I love.
Oh, Paula, darling--
Lewis, I--
I'm sorry, but--
Come here.
Breakfast is ready and--
Uncle Charles is screaming for everyone.
Mm, yes.
Paula, my lamb,
I have news for you.
Florence and I are going to get married.
Are you?
Yes.
But you scarcely know each other.
Don't be such a little woman.
Do I sense competition here?
Quite possibly.
Suppose you run along, young lady, and have those hands washed.
Certainly.
Tessa!
Tessa!
Uncle Charles, have you seen Tessa?
Oh, Tessa, she was here a moment ago...
...messing about with some flowers.
I'm famish!
Where are the others?
Robert-o!
Tessa!
Tessa.
-Have you seen Tessa?
-I came in just now, Miss.
-Roberto, have you seen her?
-She's gone to find Miss Toni.
Here they are, now.
Tessa!
Tessa!
-She's fainted.
-She's quite pale.
Bring her into the house.
-You told her.
-Yes.
What's happened?
Told her what?
Poor little Tessa.
She often does this when she runs too hard.
Take her to our bed, Lewis,
I know how to take care of her.
She's all right, Florence.
I can take care of her.
All right.
They're excitable little things, arent' they? It's just a faint.
There's always something silly happening up here!
All right you are, father dear.
What are you laughing at?
When you hear my news you're going to faint.
I'll faint if I don't get my breakfast. Robert-o!
Sí, sí, signore!
Well, what's the joke?
The joke will wait till after breakfast.
Have you gone barmy, too?
Yes, I'm afraid I have, darling.
Hello.
-She has faint before.
-Oh, please, go, Roberto.
Poor little Tessa.
Go and have your breakfast, Lewis.
Why did you run so fast?
Don't talk to her, Lewis.
Please, go.
She's all right now.
If you need anything call me.
-Isn't that Lady Longborough's mare?
-Yes, sir.
Hello, Charles!
Oh, there you are!
Hello... hello, Charles.
My dear Constance.
One can drop off at this slow pace.
I've been behind you all over around the park.
I couldn't mistake that fat back of yours.
-When did you get back to London?
-About a week.
What's all this about Florence?
My girls tell me that...
...she's hidden that beautiful husband of hers away.
I can't wait to know what's wrong with him.
That's a long story. You're coming tonight, of course.
Yes, I called up Florence and accepted at once.
I can't wait to see this man, this Mr. Dodd. Who was he?
-That's still a matter of conjecture.
-Oh, I see.
Not a bad looking sort of bloke, bangs away all day on a piano...
Nothing wrong, really.
It's all quite beyond me but...
...as long as he keeps
Florence happy.
-She's all I've got left, you know.
-Is she happy?
It's something new for her, a chap like this.
We, Creightons, have always been on the exploring side.
Mmm, I remember, that nice sister of yours, Evelyn.
That was a sort of musician fellow too, wasn't it?
Yes, well, that's too another story.
-Well, I see you tonight, right?
-All right.
-Good-bye.
-Good-bye.
Take care of yourself.
-What's all this about?
-Mrs. Dodd's orders, sir.
Reception tonight.
The second piano, sir.
Oh!
-Be careful!
-Careful!
-Where you want it, governor?
-I'll let you know.
The hat, sir?
I'd like to know how you got it into your head that I'm a pianist,
-which I'm not.
-That's a pose, darling.
We're married.
Why pose to me?
I've heard you play with Carolli, so...
...I have Carolli coming to play the piece with you.
The other piano is coming in now.
Then let him play alone!
Why stick me out there on exhibition?
I promised myself you'll play,
I promised lots of my friends--
I will not be told what I must or must not do!
I've never permitted to be bullied and I'm not going to start now.
I'm not a child.
Aren't you behaving like one?
One thing in the world I hate is your class of upper-class.
-Pompous, hard-headed, domineering.
-Now, you're becoming rude.
If you hated my class, why did you--?
I know. Why did I marry you?
Well, you said that before, and each time you ask...
...I find it more difficult to answer.
-You'd not dare say such a thing--
I do dare! I have dared, it's the blunt truth.
It's most ungallant and cruel of you to say such a thing to my face!
You dislike the truth.
I'm sorry I haven't got the gift for that...
...mental sleight of hand you people call manners.
I won't allow you to say such things to me.
Then, stop me, or leave me alone.
-Madame...
-What?
The other piano, madame.
Oh, yes. Bring it in here with the other one, will you?
Come on, boys.
-Good morning, Lewis.
-Good morning, Charles.
I'm very angry.
You're very wet.
Nevertheless, I-I--
I've never felt less like talking to anyone in my life.
You two people are turning this house into a camp room.
If this sort of brawling gives you such squack... why don't you go out in the park and shout it out?
Was I very noisy?
I thought you weren't earnest!
And I'm sure the servants and those workmen out, even the policeman on the corner would share my impression.
Whenever did you learn to behave like this, Dodd?
Where did Florence learn to believe she's a superior being?
Florence has no such illusions.
Whatever minor differences arise between you...
...you could have the decency to keep it between yourselves.
Yes, Charles.
I realize that you're a different sort of chap.
You have your ideas about things and we have ours.
And there you are, it's love's young dream and...
...I can readily see that it could easily go on the rocks.
I don't care about you, but Florence, well, naturally...
...she's a great concern to me.
And let me tell you, Dodd,
I think, well-- you seem to take a certain satisfaction on upsetting her.
No, no...
Look, those people we had to lunch last Thursday, you lunched in the park!
And told her you'd rather eat with the birds...
...and share your lunch with them.
After all, that is-- well, it seems to me, I'm sure that if I cared for a woman--
-well, you know what I mean.
-My dear Charles,
I will not be run by Florence or anyone else.
Oh, no, come, come, my dear chap.
How is she trying to run you?
She wants me to become a concert pianist overnight...
-...and perform at the party.
-The poor girl's got her heart set on that.
-I know.
-I dislike this piano business myself.
But she's got quite a lot of friends and...
...you've been sort of a mystery chap to them all.
-You know Florence.
-I wonder.
Have you had any doings with horses?
-Mm?
-Horses.
Horses? I'm afraid not.
If you'd had, you'd know that a strong light hand works wonders.
-Oh, you mean, slap?
-With Florence? Oh, dear, no!
Not on your life! Then, you would have fireworks!
But a light rein,
Lewis, my boy.
She's got plenty of spirit.
You wouldn't have her otherwise.
And she's really devoted to you.
I know that.
You are the first and only one.
And she's a woman.
And a very charming one.
I do see clearly what you mean.
It might easily be that
I'm the one that's wrong.
-We must do something about it.
-Ah, good boy.
I'm really very sorry about all this.
Now, don't you lean over too much the other way.
She'll take the bit in her teeth if you give her too much ahead.
-I see. Thank you very much, Charles.
-Not at all.
Hello.
Here's your piano.
I hope it's in tune.
Uh-huh. Very nice.
You're nice.
Do I always seem to get my own way?
I see no reason why you shouldn't.
I'm afraid my way is a little on the selfish side sometimes.
But in this instance is as much for you as for me.
-For me?
-I want them to know you, like you.
In other words, I want to show you off.
I'm really very proud of you.
You can't blame me, can you?
In that case, I shall play from the heart.
Who is that letter from?
-Paula.
-Oh, Paula?
-The girls! Let me see it.
-No, it's to me and private.
There can't be nothing private about those kids.
-It's addressed to me.
-It's addressed to both of us.
I'm losing my patience with them.
-Why?
-They're spoiled, both of them.
"When Florence wrote that letter to say we must stay,"
"our hearts were broken."
"It's probable that we shall hang ourselves,"
"but Tessa insists that it is a coward's game."
"Hanging, I mean."
"The girls here are hateful.
They say we don't wash."
They don't wash...
"Because of Tessa's heart, she doesn't have to play hockey."
"I do, while she goes off and thinks of so many things."
"One thing I know she wonders is..."
"...whether you're having a nice time and like being married."
Well, they should be the ones to lose their patience.
It sounds like a horrid school!
They've been there four months!
Darling, how can you say that,
I was there myself.
The girls say it, both of them.
They're not liars.
Lewis, didn't you yourself want them to go?
-Didn't you write to father to come to their aid? -Yes, I know.
Didn't I voluntarily constitute myself their guardian?
I know you did, darling.
-What are we going to do with them now?
-Let them stay where they are.
There's Tessa with a bad heart...
Darling, I'm assured it's not serious.
It's called valvular lesion, I went into the matter thoroughly.
Valvular what? It sounds ugly.
I don't like it.
-No, we must take this our way.
-And send her where?
Wherever she can stay, just as she is.
We'll go down to the school and see what it's all about.
Darling, I know what it's all about.
Tonight we have the party.
I'll go down with you tomorrow.
-All right, we'll surprise them.
-Nothing would surprise those simps.
-You always seem to be digging at them.
-Do I?
Yes.
-You should bring this on a tray, Roberto.
-Sí, signora.
"Sanger sisters disappeared this morning."
"Last seen at about 11:00.
Are they with you?"
"We'll not inform police until I hear from you."
-There! You see?
-I do see.
I'm going to wash my hands of them, that's all.
Fine. While you're washing your hands...
...I'm going to find them.
-Where?
-Roberto!
-Sí, signore.
First, I'll go to the school.
Would you be kind enough to phone them there?
-And tell them to advise the police.
-Lewis...
I'm almost afraid to remind you that we have guests tonight.
-Guests?
-Our party.
Oh! Well, if I find them
I'll be here.
You will not humiliate me by being among those missing, will you?
Don't be absurd! I'm certainly going to find those children!
The florists ask if you'd like festoons in the drawing room.
I don't care.
-Hello, Florence.
-Hello, Constance.
Hello, Alicia.
-What on earth are you doing out here?
Go along, darling.
I'll be there in a moment.
You'll catch your death of cold.
-Good evening.
-Good evening, madame.
Ah, there you are, Charles!
Hello, Contance. Alicia.
How are you, Turtle?
Any woman's voice singing gives me a toothache.
A nerve I suppose.
You should hold whiskey in your mouth, over the tooth.
I can't do that. I've been drinking brandy and they don't mix.
-Wouldn't brandy do as well, mother?
-Yes, I suppose so.
Your Florence will have more than a toothache...
...if she doesn't come away from that draughty door.
Really? Oh, well...
Come on, let's go in.
What were you doing at the door?
You'll catch your death of cold.
It's humiliating. I don't even know where he is.
He'll sure follow those wretched children onto the continent.
-And never come back, any of them.
-Don't say that.
Take that look off your face.
It's an excellent party.
In spite of that dreadful woman warbling her head off.
-Good heavens!
-What?
There's that Fritzie chap.
Did you ask him?
Lewis wanted them asked. I didn't think they'd come all the way from France.
Hello, there.
I didn't see you come in.
-You were very preoccupied, madame.
-At the door, yes.
-I'm glad you're here.
-Oh, I love parties...
...and Fritz loves moving in higher circles, so we came.
I was frightfully sick on the boat.
Florence, you're looking awfully worried.
The children run away from school and we're in a panic.
-Lewis is out searching for them--
-Fritz and I thought they would do it.
By the way, I'm going to have a baby.
Florence, did you hear anything since I telephoned?
No.
-Hello, Lewis.
-Hello, Fritz. Hello, Toni.
-Lewis, darling!
-Did you find them?
-No, I'm worried to death.
What did you do?
I was going up to Seven Oaks from that school...
...and I knew you wanted me back for this thing.
I've got Scotland Yard after them.
Darling, hurry and change,
Roberto's waiting for you.
Oh, yes, I must. You two, come up with me, we can talk.
Yes. Careful, darling.
Hurry!
Roberto! I'm going to have a baby.
Un bambino, magnifico, signora.
-Hello, Roberto.
-Mr. Fritz.
Mr. Lewis, they are here.
Signorinas Paula and Tessa.
-Here?
-Yes, they arrived two hours ago.
-Did you tell madame?
-No, the girls would not have it.
They see the people, they're afraid, so...
...they wait in the stables.
-Go and get them! Pronto!
Ah, that's a load off my mind.
-In the stables?
Yes, the studio were I work is over the stables.
Lewis, Fritz and I've been talking.
As I'm going to have a baby
I'll need company and--
Little Toni is going to have a baby.
Lewis, don't embarrass me.
Oh, I've got to dress.
Paula could come with us to Paris.
She'd be very happy with us and she could go on with her dancing.
And we could leave Tessa to your tender mercies. -Yes!
When is the big performance?
-Four weeks, Regents Hall.
Come along, Fritz.
He must dress.
I'll be down!
This is Toni and Mr. Bercovy.
Lady Longborough.
Her husband.
Are you hiding a family as well as a husband?
Will you excuse me, please?
Who are those little girls?
-My little sisters.
-And the police were after you.
-The police? Lewis, you didn't!
Of course I did!
What was I to do?
Tessa, did you know the police were after us?
Lewis!
-They're back.
-So we all heard.
Hello, Florence. We do hope we're not in the way.
-Of course not. Hello, Tessa.
-Good evening, Florence.
Lewis--
What are you so shy about?
I'm not shy.
I've come to lay my bones among you.
Darling, it's been so long.
-Longer than the longest book.
-Yes.
Come along. You're like a little boy.
You're younger than they are.
What a beautiful suit.
Thank you, darling.
-I'm really sorry about all this.
-About us coming back?
No! Here we go.
Now, you kids, behave.
Please don't be angry, Florence.
We couldn't bear that school a moment longer.
Now, why didn't you let us know you were running away?
We've been off our heads all day!
Haven't we, Florence?
I imagined you dead under trains, hanging from trees...
I could not bear it!
We'll go down now.
I'll send you up something to eat.
Oh, thank you so much, Florence.
We starved.
You haven't had anything to eat?
-When did you get here?
-Hours ago.
-Why didn't I know?
-Darling, you were having a party.
Naturally, they were afraid you'd be upset.
-You can see that, right?
-Anyone would think I was an ogress.
I shall play for you, sweet Florence...
-...as I've never played before.
-What are you going to play?
-The Sanger Symphony.
-Oh, Lewis, are you?
It's called "Tomorrow", a symphonic poem.
Even you will like it.
Come along, darling.
Can we listen, you think?
I shall be most hurt if you don't.
-From up there, girls.
-Naturally, Florence.
Florence, where have you been?
Lewis, my boy,
I want to introduce you...
...to one of my oldest friends.
May I present my son-in-law,
Mr. Lewis Dodd. Lady Longborough.
-How do you do, Mr. Dodd?
-How do you do?
At long last.
-This is my daughter, Alicia.
-How do you do?
-Captain Turtle.
-How do you do?
-Turtle?
-Yes, sir.
I will buzz along. You know, a little bubbly water.
Yes, run along.
-Excuse us.
-Careful, dear.
-Yes, mother.
-Is his name really Turtle?
-Yes, Turtle.
Archie Turtle, yes. Why?
I don't know.
What's the joke?
-It's no joke, Charles.
-What's no joke?
Captain Turtle!
Isn't there a fable about a fox and a turtle?
You mean, the hare and the turtle.
He has a fine pack of foxhounds, if that's what you mean.
Yes, that's exactly what we mean, Charles.
You two seem to have clicked.
Have you met before?
No, no, very unfortunately.
Dodd's very well-mannered.
He couldn't look less like a musician.
You should live in this house and hear him musicianing every morning.
My husband used to sing in the bath every morning, regularly.
I'm sure he did. He had good cause to be happy.
I could beat Florence for hiding you away from me.
Florence! Come here!
Constance is stealing your husband.
To the piano with me, my boy.
Mr. Carolli's waiting for you.
Besides, you're making too much of a success with women.
-If you take him away I shall go.
-Awww... really?
I'm 72 years old,
I don't like music.
-I have an appointment with a horse.
-Tonight?
No, early in the morning. Sylvia, my mare, gets fretty if I'm late.
Mr. Carolli's getting fretty about your music. Come along.
-I'd love a drink.
-You can have one later.
Please stay.
He's going to play now.
Yes, I stay. Get me a straight chair.
It was very kind of you to come, Mr. Carolli.
You know, I'm not a concert pianist.
You'll have to do most of it.
You have written a mouthful.
-A lot of people don't like music.
-Quiet, father, please.
That wretched woman warbling got them all in.
-On your own head be it!
-Father...
It's a wonder to me any reasonable piano...
...can stand up under such a pounding.
Maybe that's why they have two pianos.
Quiet, Uncle Charles.
-What's the matter with you?
-That's not what he said he'd play.
The first opening chords were the ones
Sanger wrote on that day but--
-the main theme is so dissonant.
-There's no melodic line.
There's no feeling of it, it's just rhythm.
It's very modern.
It's long way from tears.
-What do you mean?
Sanger said Lewis would be great if he could only cry or suffer.
I suppose this is a form of suffering.
Don't joke.
Listen to it.
I am, and he's forgot his heart again.
He did remember it once.
Remember?
Then Florence came along and he lost it again.
And they lived happily everafter.
-That's not what I mean.
It's his music.
Well, what can you do about it?
Lewis has gone from us.
What else could it ever be now?
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Miss Tessa.
-Nice party last night?
-Yes, Miss.
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Miss.
-Good morning, Tessa
-Good morning, Florence.
-Very nice last night, Thorpe.
-Thank you, madam.
There'll be six for lunch.
Tell the cook to come down.
-Good morning, Hamilton.
-Good morning, Miss Tessa.
-Oh, Florence?
-Yes.
-It must've been a lovely party.
-Yes, it was.
I'm really awfully sorry about it.
Yes, we must talk about that.
At least you got one of us off your hands.
I just saw Paula off at the station with Toni and Fritz...
...and she looked very happy.
Now I only have one little problem.
Speaking of problems, where's Lewis?
At work, in the studio.
-Oh, thank you.
-He's working.
Yes, I know.
-Good morning, Robert-o!
-Good morning, signorina.
If you have a bad heart, why you dash upstairs like that?
Here I am, the last of the brood.
And the pick of the bunch.
-Well, I'm glad about one thing.
-What's that?
You haven't been turned into a lady.
I thought that's what you wanted me to become.
No! Promise me you won't change.
You're perfect as you are.
-You think so?
-I know so.
-Is your concert on the 28th?
-Uh-huh, 28th., Regents Hall.
-Are you very excited about it?
-Not a bit.
-I wouldn't blame you.
-Why?
It's only my opinion.
Of what?
Of what Sanger's opinion would be if he had come to your nice party.
In the first place, it was not my nice party. It was Florence's.
It sounded a bit like it.
Tessa! Are you being ungracious?
Of course not.
I only meant that, uh--
What?
-What? What do you mean?
-You know what I mean.
You mean this?
-Don't stop. It's so exciting.
-What's exciting?
You really took them by storm last night. They were thrilled.
They were amateurs! Ask Tessa what she thinks of it.
-Why should I?
-She's a musician.
What is your opinion, Tessa?
Well, it was very loud, and very defiant, and it was very aggressive, and I suppose some people...
...pretend to like it even if they didn't understand it.
And did you understand it, Tessa?
Thank you, Florence.
Unfortunately no and I don't think
Lewis did, either.
That is, if he's as honest about his work as he always has been.
What are you talking about?
A symphonic poem entitled "Tomorrow" by Lewis Dodd. Remember?
That's what she's talking about.
It was very beautiful. Once you had a melodic line you were going to develop it.
-And I haven't developed it, I suppose.
-No, you haven't.
Oh, what's the matter with you, darling Lewis?
I don't know, I'm bewildered.
You aren't taking her seriously, are you? Why argue with her?
Lewis had something very worthwhile. once. Sanger said so...
...and at the time Lewis agreed.
Then he must have become ashamed of it and-- hid it under a lot of--
-A lot of what?
Mathematics!
Lewis is in deathly terror of sentiment.
About his work, I mean, aren't you, Lewis?
The melody is here!
Oboes.
Listen.
I did listen last night.
Eight miserly little bars and then...
...suddenly, off you go and sound like a railway engine!
Bang-a-tee, bang-a-tee, bang!
Bang-a-tee, bang-a-tee, bang?
What do you mean?
Really, Lewis, I wonder you have the patience.
Of course I have patience.
She's a Sanger.
Sanger or not, I hope you won't change it.
I must say, all you Sanger people are so talented.
It's a wonder to me you don't write something of your own.
I wish I could, but, you see, I have no talent or-- vocation for anything.
Well, let's change the subject.
I've spoken to Miss Batterfield on the phone...
...and she refuses to have you back.
So, I decided upon a new school, that is, if they'll have you--
No, school for Tessa is out of question.
She can't play games and...
...she doesn't like girls and girls don't like her.
What are we to do with her?
-The first thing is to find out...
...what her instinct tells her about this piece.
You wouldn't think of changing it.
-Why not, if it's wrong?
-Your concert's in four weeks!
You don't think I'll perform knowing I had missed.
You haven't missed.
You're caught up in all this mad Sanger nonsense again.
After you worked so steadily and so seriously.
Perhaps, too steadily and too seriously.
Tessa, will you speak when you're spoken to?
Will you please not lose your temper?
Oh, I started this. I'm sorry.
All right, all right... Err, let's stop all this, Florence.
If you don't mind, I--
I'd like to think a little.
Of course. We'll go for a walk in the park, Tessa...
...and talk about you and what to do. Come along.
No, as a matter of fact,
I'd like Tessa to stay here...
...and talk about it.
Obviously, she remembers the original play.
Of course I'll stay, Lewis, if you really want me to.
Would that be all right, Florence?
Certainly.
Lewis, that's it!
All right, it'll be four dozens of these.
Mrs. Lewis Dodd,
200 Grosvenor Square.
Four dozens of these. Mrs. Lewis Dodd,
200 Grosvenor Square.
I'll take the large one.
Please wrap it up nicely,
I'll take it with me-- excuse me...
Do you think it's too large for Lewis?
No, it's beautiful but
I don't think he'll wear it.
I think he will.
Do you by any chance send bouquets to male composers?
I've never heard of it, Miss.
-I'm sending flowers to Florence.
-What are you sending?
-Roses, four dozens.
-Oh, Fritzie!
Wouldn't it be fun if you sent the flowers to Florence from Lewis?
He's never sent her flowers, he's been working so hard.
She'd be so pleased!
All right, then I'll send some more from Toni and me.
Oh, no, that would take all the gloss off the gingerbread.
There'd be nothing but roses.
Let's just send these from Lewis.
All right. And what shall I write on the card?
She knows your handwriting.
He can write it.
The cards, please.
Thank you. Uh...
...would you be kind to write in a kind of untidy handwriting...
"To dear kind Florence"
No, "kind" isn't right, she--
It's not enough--
What is she?... uh...
"To dear, dear, patient Florence..."
"To dear, dear, patient Florence, with all my love, Lewis."
No, just say:
"Love..."
"Dear, dear, patient Florence.
Your Lewis."
Thank you.
No, he wouldn't say that. Um...
Leave out the "your".
Just say "Lewis".
"To dear, patient Florence.
Lewis."
Thank you. Send them over right away
You know the address?
-Yes, Miss.
-Thank you.
Come on, Fritzie.
-Thank you.
-You'll write it very untidily, right?
-Yes, Miss.
Ooh, look, they're all over London.
I'm so excited I can hardly breathe.
Would you stand still just a minute? Thank you.
I wish Toni and Paula were here to see it all.
We'll be over in Spring to stay, after the baby.
Isn't Toni excited? It's such fun creating things, isn't it?
-Good evening, sir.
-Good evening.
-Is tea ready?
-Yes, Miss.
You'll see Lewis if I have to carry you. - I have to go.
-I'll take the box.
-I carry my dress. Come on.
-Hello, my darling Uncle!
-Hello.
You remember Fritzie, don't you?
-How do you do, sir?
I have to go to the hotel now--
-No, no...
Mr. Fritzie, I shall never forget him.
How do you do, sir?
You look nice and warm and comfy.
I have to go back.
-You're going to say hello to Lewis.
-I have an appointment!
You come and pour me a cup of tea.
This place is like the Sahara desert.
Not a soul in sight and it's after 5:00.
All right, I will.
Good-bye, sir.
-Fritzie...
...you go through there and up those stairs, and don't forget to tell Lewis about the flowers for Florence...
...so he knows.
-Oh, yes, the flowers.
Ooh, nice!
Oh!
-What?
I got a stitch.
It's all right, it's nothing.
I'm so excited about tonight.
Lewis' name is advertised on all the sandwich boards.
Oh, well!
-Look.
-What is it?
It's my dress. Toni sent it,
Fritz brought it.
I won't look such a child in this, will I?
You don't call yourself a child, young woman.
Well...
It's fresh.
If I'm not a child, then, why does your sweet daughter...
...insists on bundling me away to that finishing school in Harrogate?
I assure you, if it doesn't finish me, I-- shall be here at home on and off until I die.
That is, of course, if Florence invites me.
Oh, my darling Uncle...
Can't I marry you?
Then I'll have some place to stay on my holidays.
You'd have me whacking at that silly piano all day, just as you're doing with that extraordinary son-in-law of mine.
Yes, you're right, he is extraordinary.
And very, very tired.
-Hello, Florence.
-Who's tired?
Lewis. He worked until
2 o'clock this morning...
...and rehearsed till 11:00.
-Oh, you have your tea, father.
-Yes.
-All set for tonight?
-Yes, we're going to the Savoy.
-Oh, Florence?
-Yes?
Speaking of the Savoy,
I was wondering how you like this dress.
-Toni sent it, Fritz brought it.
-Fritz?
I thought I heard his voice in the studio.
If they want their tea, they'd better come now. It's getting late.
I sent for Lewis twice.
-I'll get him.
She'll get him...
-She hasn't already?
-What are you talking about?
You know, I'm not quite such a fool that I don't see what's going on.
It's obvious, a blind man could see it. - No, no, no...
...I mean what's going on with you, not with anyone else.
You are the one that's heaping coal to fire. And let me tell you...
...if you care about your husband, you'd better pull yourself together.
Stop moaning about like a woman in a novel.
You have little Tessa on the defensive for him.
I heard it just now.
I dislike her intensely.
Yes, and you made that quite obvious to all and sundry.
I saw my sister Evelyn get herself into just such a mess...
...and it killed her.
Lewis has been very happy here and so have I...
...until these wretched
Sanger children came storming back.
They're like a drug to him.
There's some language between them that only they can understand.
I feel like a stranger in my own house!
He said quite casually to me today that he might go away after the concert.
What?
-Go away.
-There you are...
...he's like a weathervane, this fellow.
I hardly see him anymore.
Lewis is the only man
I ever truly cared for...
...or ever will care for.
It's some sort of a strange, slow process of defeat.
Either very innocent... or very clever.
If you don't stop hammering away at it...
...you'll force him to make a bolt for it. You'll see.
You don't want them to bolt, do you?
That's my nightmare.
I'm so afraid of that.
-I couldn't stand it.
-Poor little Florence.
Come on, get your chin up.
You always had your own way.
You won everything you wanted all along the line.
Now, if you have to be a loser, well--
Don't worry, I won't lose.
I think I'll toddle off.
...advertising your name on the sandwich boards everywhere!
My dear sir.
I'm just going to get forty winks before the show.
It isn't a show and don't you fall asleep tonight, either.
Don't you think you ought to get forty winks?
My lambkin, I don't even want twenty winks. I'm wide awake.
Florence, darling, sorry I'm late.
Blame it on Fritzie.
So, you are the culprit, Mr. Fritz.
How's Toni?
She was fine when I left her.
I'm going to telephone her now.
My dress, Toni sent it.
You like it?
-Very pretty.
-Thank you.
-Tea, Mr. Fritz?
-No, thank you. I have to go.
We'll be seeing you tonight, Fritzie?
-Yes, of course.
Tea, Lewis?
-No, thank you, darling.
Later on, I might have a brandy and soda.
-Oh, I'll get it for you.
He said later!
I'm sorry.
Well-- I might just as well have it now.
Here's Thorpe.
Bring the bottle of brandy and some soda, will you, Thorpe?
I forgot to tell Lewis about the flowers.
You know, I'm very jealous.
-Who's been sending you flowers?
-Lewis.
Come on, let me see the card.
-Lewis, I forgot...
-What did you forget?
-Madame, I can explain, I--
-It was really my fault.
We were at the florist's and--
Oh, Fritzie, you spoiled it all...
-What has he spoiled?
-Well, Florence, you see, I--
I bought some flowers for Lewis to give to you and then,
Fritzie forgot to tell Lewis--
Yes, of course! I did ask Fritz if he'd be kind enough to--
Lewis...
Thorpe, please put this flowers in Mr. Dodd's studio. - Yes, madam.
Oh, darling, you're not cross, are you?
Of course not. Why discuss it?
Although I don't think it's important enough to lie about.
You know, I'm a thoughtless brute.
I should have done something like that on my own.
I'm sorry, darling, it's the nature of the beast, I'm afraid.
I have no regrets. Anyway, you have Tessa to think for you.
Florence, truthfully, it was only an idea
I thought and it went wrong.
-Well, see you tonight, Fritzie.
-Yes...
Did Mr. Fritz think of the words
"patient Florence"?
Oh, darling, you are patient.
And you're altogether too nice to be upset, today of all days.
-You won't recognize the music, Fritzie.
-Has it been changed?
Got a little heart in it now.
And you're familiar with Lewis' heart.
I appreciate it, if that's what you mean.
But I suppose I always have.
-Good night, Lewis.
-Good night. See you tonight.
Come take the weight off your feet.
What do you think it is with Florence?
I don't know.
She's quite unaccountable.
-What do you think it is?
-I don't know!
Today I told her I'd go away somewhere alone after the concert.
I see, that could easily be it.
Was she very angry?
No, on the contrary, she was very quiet.
I feel sorry for her.
But we shouldn't be talking about this private thing, should we?
I suddenly feel ashamed.
-I felt ashamed for so long.
-Don't say that, I don't want to hear.
-Then, you know what I mean?
-No, I don't want to know.
Are you disturbed about me?
Of course I am!
-Little Tessa...
-Such a "little Tessa", such an insignificant nuisance little Tessa.
I think I've known it always.
And yet, why didn't I know?
Lewis, whatever you think you know, you must forget it now.
-I love you, Tessa.
-No.
I know I always have.
Once a long time ago, when I kept a diary...
-...I wrote something down.
-Did you?
"One day Lewis will look at me and everything will be all right."
And I didn't look.
There were other things to see, that was all.
Please don't talk about it.
It's too late now.
No, it isn't.
You're coming away with me.
-Why did you marry Florence?
-I don't know. Now.
You couldn't have thought anything about me.
Tessa, I always have, really.
Then it was unfair to both of us for you to marry her.
You were so mad to get her that you forgot all about me!
Oh, if only you had waited a bit.
It was something I didn't realize.
Can you understand that?
How can I not understand you?
You've been in my mind all the time.
You've never really been away from me.
I promised myself to you such a long time ago.
My darling.
No! There's Florence.
She's my cousin,
I've been living in her house.
She's been very kind.
Anyway, you belong to her.
But if it weren't for that,
I'd rather go away with you...
...than anything else in the world.
But I can't do this.
They'd say we've been carrying on behind Florence's back,
I'd be a traitor. I can't.
One must do as one thinks right, mustn't one?
I said my say.
Non è giusto.
-Oh, Robert-o.
Scuzi, signore, but, all the servants go to the concert but me.
Poor souls! Well, if you must hear it, there's a wireless radio down in my study,
-You can switch it on down there.
-Grazie, signore.
All right, Robert-o.
Florence!
Are we going to be late as usual?
It's half past.
Very beautiful, my dear.
Thank you, father.
-I don't know about Lewis.
-Oh, Lewis, well, uh--
-Go along, father.
-Well, hurry. That's a good girl.
I couldn't face this thing without a bite and a glass of something.
-I'll be down.
-Well, hurry. That's a good girl.
You look lovely, my dear.
-No white tie, dear?
-No, I'm not conducting tonight.
I prefer to wear this.
-I see you packed.
-Yes.
-Take me with you.
-Oh, Florence,
Don't you think it's much wiser for us--?
I'm sorry about this afternoon, but
I thought you sent me some flowers.
Oh, darling, I can understand so well how you felt.
Can you understand how I feel now that you're going away?
Lewis, I'd do anything in the world that you ask me to.
Go anywhere, be or do anything.
Florence, I can't let you say things like these.
I mean, you can't put yourself in this position.
-After all, that's-- I'm the one--
-Oh, I don't care, I mean it.
I'm honest, we're married and I love you.
If I haven't completely understood you it's not my fault because I've tried.
And all the time I had the feeling
I was succeeding bit by bit.
This is humiliating, really.
-For you?
-No, of course not. For you!
You're attractive and young.
You deserve so much more than I can ever be to you.
You're giving me up?
Oh, please, you can't put it that way.
All right.
It's you don't want me anymore.
Give me another chance.
I'm begging you.
Look at me.
Don't tell me what's in your mind just now.
I don't think I could stand it.
I'm sure I couldn't.
You're going away for a while,
I'll wait for you.
You might miss me.
I hope you will, a little.
Will you do me a favor while I'm gone?
-Anything.
-It's about Tessa.
-What is Tessa to do with us?
-You were speaking of understanding.
If you could just try to understand her.
But, what does Tessa matter just now?
-Well, I won't be here and...
-And what?
If I could only be sure that you two are good friends and...
-...that you understand her...
-Yes.
-Don't look like that.
-Go on.
Well, you know Tessa, she's tender and loyal...
...and she deserves to be loved.
Since when have you loved her so deeply?
Always, I think.
And why did you marry me?
I saw no-one but you, then.
Have you told her?
Does she know?
Yes, and she will have none of me.
She spoke of you, immediately.
That's why I'm asking you to try and understand what she's really like.
Don't ask me to try and understand. I do!
-You dare suggest--?
-I do dare!
I told you she'd have nothing to do with me! Ever, because of you!
I don't believe it!
I've seen enough of them all to know they can't be trusted.
And in this house! How could you?
What else could it have been?
You couldn't even think such a thing about that child.
Don't call her a child! It makes it even more contemptible.
I put the thought away again and again, because it was so horrible.
Because I felt that, no matter what she was, you... you, at least, were decent!
I told you to go to the concert.
-I was getting the smelling salts, madam.
-I don't need them!
-They're for Miss Tessa, madam.
-Miss Tessa?
-She fainted. One of them spells she has.
-Where?
In her room.
I'll take them.
Come in.
-Hello, Florence.
-I thought you were ill.
Hamilton said you were.
It's just one of those silly dizzy spells. I'm all right, really.
Please, don't bother.
It's the excitement of tonight and...
Yes, the excitement of so many things.
You'd better rest here. You could have palpitations during the performance.
-No, I won't.
-Lie down. I'll call Dr. Tomlin.
-Please no, these things pass off.
-You'll do as you're told.
What's the matter, Florence?
You know...
I should've never come here.
I'm only a nuisance.
Don't you think that if I packed my bag and...
...went away with Fritz, stayed with
Toni and Paula for a while in Paris...
...got some job and were out of the way, don't you think it would be better?
Did you know that Lewis was leaving for the continent after the concert?
-Yes, but not to Paris.
-You know his plans?
Florence, don't have those thoughts, please!
-He only said he was going away.
-And you promptly have palpitations!
Go away.
Why did you run away from school?
To be near Lewis.
Why did you unsettle him about his work?
You know what I'm talking about.
And you succeeded, didn't you?
Didn't you?
-With Lewis? Me?
-Of course!
Oh, you're making a horrible mistake.
Such a little girl, so innocent.
I'm talking to you now as one woman to another.
I'm accusing you directly into your face.
You've flung yourself at my husband in this house and you succeeded!
I can't help it if I love Lewis! I did long before you came to Switzerland!
It's not a happy thing, it brought nothing but sadness into my life.
Yet,it's so overwhelming
I wouldn't want it to be different.
But I have come to understand he is your husband and--
I'm not going to see him anymore.
That's the reason I want to go away.
As for your thinking that we did anything else...
...that's horrible and shocking, and
I wouldn't even lower myself to deny it.
But I've told you I love Lewis and I can't help it.
You talk of love?
You don't even know what it means.
Yes, I do. I know all about it.
-What do you mean by that?
-Florence, please!
Tessa!
Tessa, come along.
Tessa.
Shouldn't you get going?
It's getting late.
I do think I'd lie down.
Yes, I will.
Please, don't be late.
I'm all right.
-Here are the smelling salts.
-Thank you.
Come in.
-Oh, what a pretty dress.
-You think so?
-Ready?
-No.
-What's the matter?
-Oh, well, I--
-What happened?
-I had a few flutterings inside and--
Nothing for you to think about.
You'd better hurry.
-What caused it?
-All the excitement of the concert.
Have they sent for the doctor?
Of course not, I'm used to them.
I know all about my valvular "lessons".
-What?
-My... lesions.
They go as quickly as they come.
-Sure you're all right now?
-Of course, I wouldn't lie to you.
Hurry up and finish dressing.
I'll tie that up for you.
Well, I wonder if I should.
Why?
These spells behave in the most embarrasing ways sometimes.
I wouldn't want to go fluttering in the middle of the performance.
They come rather quickly, a sort of humpy feeling here, and then...
...things start to go a little blurred, and then you'd have me slithering on the floor, and considerate old gentlemen would break their poor backs trying to help me up.
Then tomorrow the critics would say that you stunt your audience.
Or at least, one of them.
So, I think I'll stay here quietly and concentrate.
I may possibly be going away.
I think I'll think about it now.
Where would you go?
Anywhere, away from our situation.
It's getting late.
Better be going.
No. Our piece is not played until last.
"Our piece".
Oh, sweet generous Lewis.
There's no-one like you in the world.
I've always known that, but you haven't.
You haven't know yourself at all.
-No, until today, I think.
-You mustn't.
Tessa, you know,
I've lived so much longer in this hard world than you have... but you have such wisdom about things.
-Have I?
-Yes.
You said downstairs so truly that ours was an impossible situation.
I wonder if you know how many things have made it so.
It isn't that I'm married to Florence.
It isn't that there are so many years dividing you and me.
It's something that has been with me ever since I was a little boy.
Hearing strange music in almost anything.
-You know?
-Yes.
Everything, anything that came into my mind...
-...was never quite of this earth.
-Really?
Poor, poor dear Lewis.
You never really possessed happiness, have you?
I've known nowhere to find it.
I never had the power to sense it or take it.
I've been very fortunate.
I've always had it, as long as I can remember,
I've been very fortunate, thanks so much to you. You know,
I've never thought of you as either older or younger--
Tell me, did you ever suspect and then brushed me off for being a child?
No, truthfully, no.
Although when I thought you were lost
I nearly went out of my mind.
No, it was just this evening, downstairs.
When I looked at you...
...everything I ever longed for seemed to be there, for me.
Really, you must go to your music, now.
I'll be thinking of you. Please, go, dear sweet Lewis. Please.
I don't want to leave you a bit.
-Even if I ask you very nicely?
-I'll come back.
Aren't you going away?
You said you were.
I'm coming back.
Hurry.
Bless you.
You always kissed my forehead.
Even when I think of you, my forehead pops up to be kissed naturally.
Beloved.
It's a very beautiful word.
You can feel it, but it's so hard to say.
What?
Beloved.
I forgot to give you your flower.
I don't know when I'll see you again to give it to you.
Because I'm going away.
I must.
Lewis!
Florence is having fits.
We gave you up.
Come on, boy.
Horses are leaving the barnyard.
Sorry.
Are you a shrinking violet?
We thought you deserted us.
With all due respect to Beethoven, the thing gave me a headache.
Oh, Constance, it was his Fifth.
Here's Lewis.
Lady Saunders, General.
Hello again. This is your place.
Oh, no, please.
-The place is packed. Where were you?
-I walked.
He hasn't miss a thing.
The whole thing's very loud and harsh.
Your hands are like ice. Well, even I'm nervous. Success, Lewis.
Oh, I forgot. Good luck!
-Good luck.
-Same here!
Thank you very much.
-That's Regents Hall coming through.
-Yes. Where do you go?
-With Fritz, to Paris.
-I'll get you something to eat.
All right.
-I've been calling you.
-Yes, Lewis.
You wanted me to call you, didn't you?
Yes, I've waited so long to hear you call me.
You're not going to school, or anywhere else.
Then I'll never be a great lady.
-You want to be?
-No, no.
I want to be growing up like sting weeds.
That doesn't sound very nice, Lewis.
You want to be with me, always, don't you?
Yes, always. Forever and ever.
It's the owl of death that frightens me.
You must never be afraid.
You must be protected.
-Protected?
-Yes.
But my heart is a very simple heart.
Isn't that some protection?
Yes.
May I protect you, or try to?
There are so many years between us.
But you belong to me, even before I was born.
When you were a little boy, you must have longed for me, for me to take care of you.
I was on my way to you then.
I'm late, but I'm here.
I've been waiting for you.

#When I am dead,#
#another love will cheer thee.#
#The sun will rise...#
#...as bright tomorrow morn.#
I'm afraid!
The words frighten me!
#The birds will sing...#
#though I no longer near thee...#
#...must lie forlorn,#
#lie forlorn.#
#When I am in my grave,#
#the flowers blowing...#
#...shall make thee garlands twenty times as sweet.#
#Beauty will live,#
#...though I must sleep unknowing...#
#...beneath thy feet,#
#I must sleep beneath thy feet.#
Where's Mr. Dodd?
Where is he?
-He left.
Where's Dodd?
-He went before it finished.
Did Florence go with him?
I didn't see her.
She left just after.
We'll stop by our house for a nightcap.
-Your cab was just driving away. Lewis--
-Excuse me.
Roberto, where is Miss Tessa?
Darling, I must talk to you for a moment.
-I can't go on with you hating me.
-How can I possibly hate you?
How can you not hate me?
I've said unkind, wicked things.
-I was jealous. Can you understand?
-Of course I can understand.
I won't stand in your way another moment.
And I want to tell her so myself. May I?
Why this sudden change?
Because I love you and
I want you to be happy.
This is all my fault, Florence.
I'm the guilty one.
How can you possibly be guilty?
People don't arrange these things.
Something else does, I'm sure.
I realized that tonight, watching you in the box, hearing at the music.
Anyone else would have been-- would have--
But you've been gentle and very honest.
-But that's because you are you.
-My dear Florence.
Don't think that I haven't been conscious of your quality of--
No, I just happen to exist outside your inner world and Tessa's.
I understand it very clearly.
You must never be sorry for me.
We're friends, all of us, aren't we? Always?
-Always, yes.
-Here they are.
Not a servant in the house. Florence sent them all off to that show.
Go on with your story, sir.
-No, no, Charles, your incorrigible.
I never saw the girl again.
Girl? She was over 30.
-That's right, don't you think, sir?
-What?
About 30.
-She's asleep?
-Yes.
-Is it her bag?
-Yes.
-She's going away?
-Yes.
Did she hear the concert over the radio?
Yes.
Tessa!
Tessa.
Little Tessa...

"The history of the Pirate Mack, the Black Macoco."
Macoco the dazzling,
Macoco the fabulous...
...the hawk of the sea, the prince of pirates...
...whose spirit and legend will live on through the ages...
...for his immortal deeds, as hereinafter set forth.
And whose glorious and formidable exploits...
...are here related in a true history.
Staggering to the imagination and ravishing the sensibilities...
...with tales of wealth, of gold and silver beyond dreams of avarice...
...of stolen treasure, of maidens captive, of villages destroyed...
...of cities decimated for a whim or a caress.
Macoco.
Where are you now?
What seas do you traverse?
Is it sunrise...
...or sunset where you are?
Say, you don't suppose he's still alive?
Oh, he can't be.
They must have hanged him by now.
They'll never hang him.
On the moving waters of the Caribbean he darts about...
...like a dragonfly, glittering, uncapturable.
Oh, Manuela, the way you talk.
Why, he's nothing but a thief, a criminal.
He's not. He's not.
He's ruthless, magnificent, romantic.
If he saw a woman he wanted, he'd just come and take her...
...and carry her off on his ship, but he'd treat her like a queen.
I don't want anyone swooping down on me like a chicken hawk.
I just want a good, steady man with a plantation...
...not too big, not too small.
Oh, Casilda, I do wish you were a little more spiritual.
Don't you ever dream of a man who will take you out of this village?
Out of this little saucer in the hills?
- Don't you ever...?
- Manuela.
Yes, Aunt Inez?
Oh, my lamb, my sweet,
I've glorious news for you.
What is it, Aunt Inez?
I got you a husband.
You'll be the first of us.
Is it anybody I know?
Oh, you've probably seen him pass in his carriage.
It's Don Pedro Vargas.
Don Pedro, the new mayor?
Manuela, you'll be the mayor's wife.
But he has a big bay window.
And why not? He lives well.
Who wouldn't have?
But he's so unromantic.
Oh, I don't know, he's not so unromantic, for a rich man.
- He's the richest man on the island.
- You'll be Doña Manuela.
- You'll live in the mayor's house.
- He'll never be content to settle here.
- He's been all over the world.
- Isn't that marvelous?
He's on his way to meet you.
So if you'll forgive us...
- Oh, I think it's wonderful.
- Oh, isn't that exciting?
Show a little more feeling, Manuela.
You're the happiest girl in the world today.
Oh, of course I am.
It's just that it's happening so suddenly that...
Sudden? Why, I've been working with the lawyers for two months.
You're an orphan with no dowry,
Manuela.
You must be aware your uncle and I have been in great financial difficulties.
Oh, I know, Aunt Inez.
Your poor father and mother, may they rest in peace...
...couldn't have loved and sheltered you more.
Now you will have an opportunity of helping us.
Besides making a most advantageous marriage for yourself.
I know, Aunt Inez, and I'm very grateful, really I am.
It's just that I shan't know what to say to him.
Oh, say nothing.
He's not marrying you to listen to you.
Don Pedro, welcome to our modest home.
I enter as a humble suppliant.
Where is she?
Cecile, tell the Señorita Manuela we are awaiting her.
I have just broken the news to her, the wonderful news.
She is overwhelmed.
Oh, you make me the happiest of men.
I had been fearful.
After all, I am a self-made man...
...without the tradition and culture of your family.
And then, there is a certain, shall we say, disparity in our ages.
Disparity? Nonsense.
Manuela wouldn't look at some callow youth.
- She said that?
- I said it.
Oh, she is speechless.
Well, of course l...
I do not come to her empty-handed.
True. There are a few things to be made clear.
Capucho?
Oh, Capucho, my darling.
Your newly found nephew eagerly awaits your blessings.
- He has them.
- Where's the list?
Now, a few items that I jotted down, in case they slipped my mind.
Don Pedro, the arrangements have been more than generous...
...but there are some things... capucho's gambling debts, a matter of honor.
Wouldn't it be more simple to turn the payments yearly instead of monthly?
Anything, anything you wish.
Take it up with my lawyers.
Oh, of course.
You're getting impatient.
I'll see what's keeping her.
Manuela...!
My dear, allow me to present the man you are affianced to marry.
Manuela.
I have lived for two years in this village and I've watched you grow up.
I have traveled and I can say without boasting...
...that I have seen the fairest women in the world.
Yet I would pass them all by for one smile from you.
- Charming, isn't he?
- Yes.
You not only have his love and devotion...
...he's ordered furniture for your house from Seville...
...brocades from France, tapestries from Italy...
...and, best of all, your trousseau has been made by Maison Worth...
...the choicest house in Paris.
Paris.
Paris!
- That pleases you?
- Oh, yes.
Yes. To see Paris!
All my life I've dreamed of that.
The gaiety and color and people.
I've seen it all.
Yes. And the lovely women all dressed for the evening...
...going to some carnival...
- I shall be happy to tell you about it.
Oh, but you would never be content to settle here.
Not someone who loves to travel as you do.
On the contrary...
...traveling involves the sea, and I cannot bear the sea.
Take my word for it, Manuela.
Home is the perfect spot.
So quiet, so peaceful, so safe.
Home.
May I, please?
Oh, what an exquisite ring.
You must have bought it on your travels.
Manuela, look at it.
Have you ever seen...
...such a wonderful design?
He is the most thoughtful, the most generous of men. Isn't he?
Yes, Aunt Inez.
I can't wait to see your trousseau.
It should arrive at Port Sebastion any time now.
Port Sebastion?
Couldn't we go to Port Sebastion to meet the ship?
Drive 30 miles to meet a ship?
Well, there are dressmakers at the port...
...and there are sure to be alterations.
Please, Aunt Inez,
I'd so love to see the caribbean.
Caribbean?
Why the Caribbean?
Because it...
It holds a special fascination for me.
It means romance and adventure...
...and, as I shall never have any...
Manuela...
...don't you realize you're marrying a saint?
Morning and night, you should burn incense.
You should offer up prayers and thanks.
I'll make him a good wife.
Really, Aunt Inez.
I realize that there's a practical world and a dream world.
I know which is which.
I shan't mix them. I promise.
- That's better.
- But if I could only see the Caribbean...
...and just once before I marry,
I'd never speak of it again, ever.
Well, we'll see.
We'll see.
Ladies and gentlemen, your most kind attention.
Allow me to announce the arrival of the greatest galaxy...
...of gifted entertainers on Earth.
A brilliant company of sensational thespians.
And before you, or should I say above you...
...you see their star.
Serafin of Madrid, Serafin the Great.
The master juggler, conjurer, dancer and singer of songs.
I and my genial troupe come to you directly from our triumphs abroad...
...where we have played before all of the crowned heads of Europe.
We bring to this new world all the joy, the dexterity...
...the romance of the old, to please, astonish and delight you.
Tonight we will entertain you in the heart of your fair city.
Performance at 8:30.
Come one. Come all. Children half price.
Citizens of Port Sebastion, behold the dramatis personae of whom I speak.
Fellow artists:
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Bolo.
Do not confuse him with ordinary buffoons...
...for his performance on the trapeze has never been equaled.
And Trillo.
He can juggle seven balls at the same time...
...balancing a sharp sword on the tip of his nose.
And for those of more romantic bent, there is Gumbo...
...who imitates the love call of the lark...
...at the same time drinking a cup of water.
And these two canine marvels of the animal kingdom...
...who walk like dogs but think like men.
Ladies and gentlemen, come tonight...
...and see for yourselves the magic of our art.
Going someplace?
Ah, yes. I go to survey the terrain in advance of conquest.
How do you manage to get out of the work?
- Yeah.
- Gumbo, do not ask me to explain...
...the mysteries of genius.
- Now, wait a minute...
- Boys...
...here is my last cigar.
Divide it among you.
I was keeping it lit for you.
Niña.
Beautiful town you have here, sir.
Beautiful.
- You're one of the actors, aren't you?
- Then you know.
Niña.
Niña.
Say, why do call all the girls Niña?
My friend...
...there are so many beautiful girls in the world with so many names...
...I find it very confusing.
So I've simplified things.
I use one name.
But why... Why did you pick Niña?
Yes, why Niña?
Why not?
When I arrive in any town
I look the ladies up and down
And when I pick my favorite flame
This is my patter, no matter her name
- Niña.
- My name is Luisa.
But you could be Niña for me.
Couldn't you? Niña?
Niña, Niña, Niña, Niña
Fascinating Niña
What a lovely child
Niña, you enchant me
Niña, you're so sweet, I mean you
Fairly drive me wild
Niña, till the moment you hit my heart
Niña, I was doing just fine
But since I've seen you
Niña, Niña, Niña
I'll be having neurasthenia
Till I make you mine
Till I make you
Till I make you mine,
till I make you mine
Till I make you mine
Niña, Niña, Niña, Niña
Niña, Niña, Niña, Niña
Niña, till the moment you hit my heart
Niña, I was doing just fine
But since I've seen you
Niña, Niña, Niña
I'll be having neurasthenia
Till I make you mine, till I make you mine
Till I make you mine, till I make you mine
Niña.
You're the prize gardenia
Of the Spanish Main
Niña
Don 't be so enticing
Or I'll go insane
Niña
Niña, till alas I gazed in your eyes
Niña, I was mentally fine
But since I've seen you
Niña, Niña, Niña
I'll be having schizophrenia
Till I make you...
Oh, look, Aunt Inez, the sea.
- Manuela, what will people think?
- Señora Alva, welcome, and señorita.
Your boxes have arrived and the dressmaker is awaiting you.
- Splendid. Splendid. Come Manuela.
- No, please, Aunt Inez.
- Let me see the sea. You promised.
- We can go later.
- You needn't come. I can go alone.
- Alone? Are you mad?
No one knows me here.
I'll be back in a half an hour.
Manuela.
Manue...!
Who are you?
In Madrid...
...I hear that young ladies do not walk out without their duennas.
However, I should have thought that in a town like Port Sebastion...
...bodyguards were unnecessary.
You, gracious lady, will always need a bodyguard.
Even in the lonely wastes of the Sahara Desert...
...the sands would rise up and follow you.
Tell me, what is your name?
I do not see how that could possibly concern you.
It is as vital to me as the beat of my heart. Are you married?
No.
But I will be by this time next week.
Then you should never step into the sight of other men.
It is too great a provocation.
Very well,
I shall remove the provocation.
Señorita, don't marry that pumpkin.
- Pumpkin?
- Any man who lets you out of his sight...
...is a pumpkin.
My affianced is a very noble and pious man.
He doesn't drink. He doesn't smoke.
He's regular in his church duties.
And he would never accost a strange young woman on a...
I wish you would stop circling me this way. It's like talking to a top.
You bewilder me.
A young girl like you with beauty, youth, enchantment...
...throwing yourself away on a lump like that.
He's neither a lump nor a pumpkin.
If he had any sense, he should have known he wasn't good enough for you.
- He would have stepped aside.
- Stepped aside? For what?
For someone who could appreciate you, like me. Don't laugh.
If I didn't laugh, I should be very annoyed. Please let me go.
- Never.
- Don't be silly.
I love you.
- And love isn't silly.
- Really.
Aren't you interested in love?
No.
I told you I was going to be married.
In England and America, they have a strange custom.
The ladies pick their own husbands and they marry them for love.
Yes, I know.
It's a very stupid custom.
Oh, I see.
You find enough romance in daydreams.
What do you mean?
- I'm sure I have no idea what you...
- Don't tell me you never long...
...for a prince instead of a pumpkin.
- Certainly not.
- I don't believe you.
I know that underneath that prim exterior there are depths of emotion...
...romantic longings, unfulfilled dreams.
- That's absurd.
I can read your mind, your innermost thoughts.
It's my business.
I can tell you your past, your present and your future.
You don't have to tell me my future,
I know my future.
- Am I in it?
- No.
Then you don't know your future.
Come see me tonight and you'll find out.
I'll leave a seat for you.
Just mention my name:
Serafin.
An actor.
Ladies and gentlemen, step in and see the show...
...the wonder show of the ages.
Sensational songs that will set your heart to singing. Demons of the dance.
Canine marvels of the nineteenth century.
They walk, they talk, they're even human at times.
And we're also proud to present Gumbo and Estraban...
...dashing, debonair, death-defying masters of the swinging trapeze.
Friends, this is Bolo.
He will step amongst you with tickets, passports to paradise and happiness.
Only two reals, friends. Two reals.
Step around, will you, Bolo, please?
Magic. Mesmerism.
Ladies and gentlemen, the show is about to go on.
Hurtado. Where's the revolving mirror?
- What do you want with that?
- Never mind. Where is it?
Is it wound?
Is it oiled? Is it true?
- You're not gonna use it?
- Certainly. Take it on, Gumbo.
Oh, it's like a graveyard out there.
It's a challenge.
We shall galvanize them.
- Don't use the mirror.
- Why not?
The last person you hypnotized hasn't woked up yet.
That was a mistake. I had the misfortune to pick a man with sleeping sickness.
Now we come to the pinnacle of our entertainment.
An experiment in the new and sensational science...
...of animal magnetism...
...taught me by the great Mesmer himself.
You know, of course, the principles of the great Mesmer?
In short...
...hypnosis.
Hypnosis.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, before your eyes, I shall perform this experiment...
...but I shall need some help.
However, it must be the right person.
Control cannot be exercised over everyone.
I have failed with the confused, with the rebellious, with the recalcitrant.
To perform the experiment ideally...
...I must have a pure person.
One pure person.
Nymph...
...in thy orisons be all my sins remembered.
Purity at last.
Purity. Gracious lady, that you should be here makes it indeed a blessing.
Come. Come. I, Serafin, ask it.
You know whatever I ask you...
...whatever power I have for you is for your happiness.
Sit, gracious lady.
Pure spirit, rest.
She is now in a trance.
I am about to release her spirit from its earthly bonds.
Gracious lady, what is your name?
Your name.
Man... Manuela.
Manuela, where do you live?
In the village of Calvados.
Make a note of that.
Manuela, you don't love the man you're going to marry, do you?
- No.
- You love someone else, don't you?
- Yes.
- Who is that other, Manuela?
Someone you've just met, isn't he?
Perhaps this very afternoon.
Think.
Think.
Somewhere by the sea?
Yes.
The sea.
Who is he, Manuela? Say his name.
- He is...
- Yes?
Macoco.
Macoco?
Macoco.
Macoco the pirate?
Macoco the fabulous.
Macoco the dazzling.
No. No, Manuela.
You don't mean that.
Someday he'll swoop down on me like a chicken hawk and carry me away.
- No, Manuela. Pure soul, listen...
- And I shall do his bidding.
I shall follow him, yea, to the ends of the world I shall follow him.
No, Manuela. Forget Macoco.
Now think again, pure soul...
Don't call me pure soul.
It irritates me.
Underneath this prim exterior there are emotions, romantic longings.
- I know. I'm here to release them.
- Underneath this exterior...
...there are emotions, romantic longings.
Underneath this exterior...
- ...there's emotions, romantic longings.
- Wake up. Wake up.
Macoco.
Macoco.
Macoco.
There's a pirate known to fame
Black Macoco was the pirate's name
In his day, the tops was he
Round the Caribbean
Or Caribbean Sea
Manuela. Wake up.
Mack the Black
Round the Caribbean
Mack the Black
Or Caribbean Sea
Mack the Black
Round the Caribbean
Round the Caribbean or Caribbean Sea
As a child his nurse foretold
Mack was sure to be a pirate bold
For when feeding time would come
Mack'd have a bottle
But a bottle of rum
Mack the Black
Mack'd have a bottle
Mack the Black
But a bottle of rum
Mack the Black
Mack'd have a bottle
Mack'd have a bottle
But a bottle of rum
When he'd sight a clipper ship
Mack would board her and begin to clip
First he'd grab the ladies fair
Especially those with jewels
Those with jewels to spare
Mack the Black
Especially those with jewels
Mack the Black
Those with jewels to spare
Mack the Black
Especially those with jewels
Especially those with jewels
Those with jewels to spare
When he'd make his daily rounds
Gals would trail him
Like a pack of hounds
Every night he'd have a date
Ladies go to pieces over pieces of eight
Mack the Black
Ladies go to pieces
Mack the Black
Over pieces of eight
Mack the Black
Ladies go to pieces
Ladies go to pieces
Over pieces of eight
Evening star, if you see Mack
Stop his wandering
And guide him back
I'll be waiting patiently
By the Caribbean
Or Caribbean Sea
Mack the Black
By the Caribbean
Mack the Black
Or Caribbean Sea
Mack the Black
By the Caribbean
By the Caribbean
Or in case you're not agreeing
The Caribbean Sea
Mack the Black Macoco
From Guadeloupe to Barbados
Tornadoes
Give in to his desperadoes
Throughout the Caribbean or vicinity
Macoco leaves a flaming trail
Of masculinity
And suddenly I feel
I've got a big affinity
And I'm loco
For Mack, Mack
Mack the Black Macoco
Manuela, Manuela, awake.
Return to yourself.
Wake.
- Can't you wake her?
- You'll be jailed for this.
Use voodoo.
Get her out of it with voodoo.
- Use rattlesnake skins and vinegar.
- They say lizard milk and...
- Burn a feather under her nose.
- Let me try again.
Stand back. Stand back.
They're cheering for you, for your singing and dancing.
- Singing and danc...
- You've set them on fire.
No.
No!
Manuela.
Manuela.
Aunt Inez.
Aunt Inez. Aunt Inez. Wake up. I wanna go home. I wanna go home this minute.
- But it's still dark.
- I don't care. I want to go home.
Oh, well, we might as well.
We'll never sleep a wink here.
Oh, I've never known such a noisy place.
Those actors.
They had a girl too.
I heard her singing.
A girl? A girl?
Oh, it sounded like a girl.
Oh, Aunt Inez, Don Pedro was right.
He was right.
Home, it's safe.
It's safe, it's protected and it's quiet.
- Yes, it's quiet. Yes. Yes...
- I wanna go home. Hurry, please.
- Come on, Aunt Inez, please hurry.
- Manuela, wait...
Manuela, it's going to be a beautiful silhouette.
Señor Gomez,
I would like an extra copy for our salon.
The señorita is the loveliest bride
I have ever painted.
- Thank you...
- Don't move, please.
Would you like a bouquet in the corner?
No, no. It spoils the composition.
One moment more. There.
The outline is complete.
Thank you.
The sun is shining for you today.
A good omen.
My Manuela, the wife of our mayor.
You're going to be so happy.
What if I'm not?
You will be, my dear, if you wish for it hard enough.
You can make anything come true by wishing for it.
Anything?
Anything.
Men, right here. Set up over here.
Manuela, come along.
We have to start.
No. Aunt Inez, I can't go.
- I can't.
- Now, now, Manuela.
- I know exactly how you're...
- Aunt Inez, it's that actor.
- Actor?
- He's here.
He's coming in the house.
I daren't leave.
Now, Manuela.
Please calm down and tell me what you're talking about.
Aunt Inez, I have something dreadful to tell you.
Do you remember in Port Sebastion...
...when you thought you heard a girl singing?
You did. It was me.
I can't believe it. It can't be true.
Oh, do you think I'd make up a thing like that?
- How could you? Whatever possessed...
- I don't know, I don't know.
He had a mirror that spun around and his voice and his eyes, and l...
Capucho. Oh, Capucho.
I want you to listen carefully.
Bolt the front door and don't let anyone in. You understand?
- My dear, if I may make a suggestion?
- Yes, of course. Hurry. Manuela.
I'm going for Don Pedro.
- Lock the door and don't leave the room.
- No.
- Now, don't leave it.
- No, I won't. Oh, lock the door.
Lock the door and don't leave this room.
Lock the door and don't leave this room.
Lock the door...
Manuela.
No.
No.
No.
Fair Juliet of the Caribbean.
Go away.
Trillo. Trillo, me jacket.
Ta-da.
Manuela.
Don't you dare take another step across that wire.
Don't you dare.
Manuela. Manuela, you don't mean that.
You don't mean that.
All right.
Do you see these? Do you see these?
I'm going to count to three.
Count to three. One, two...
Three.
All right. You've asked for this.
You should have thought of this before you started.
You know, you know you wouldn't cut that rope.
Manuela, you couldn't do that.
Please.
Don't come any nearer.
It looks so bad.
Go away. I'm going to be married.
- Go away. Don't come near me.
- Manuela.
- Don't come near me. Leave me alone
- Manuela. Wait. We're here, Manuela.
- We've come to get you.
- Leave me alone.
Manuela, are you real or an angel?
- How dare you come here.
- Have I walked the tightrope to heaven?
- How dare you!
- That wedding gown, that veil.
It isn't possible that you're still thinking of getting married.
Not after that night.
Not after hearing that applause...
- Oh, stop it. Stop it.
...and seeing those people.
Can't you understand I have nothing but horror and shame...
...for what I did that night?
Horror? Shame? You were wonderful.
Believe me, you gave a brilliant performance.
And with polish, you'll be even better.
- Will you go now?
- Oh, Manuela, come with us.
We'll tour these enchanted islands, then on to Rome.
- You wanna disgrace me, ruin me.
- Madrid, Paris.
My fiancé will be here any minute.
- Well, let's go quickly.
- No.
Manuela, you can't marry that man.
You're not in love with him, you're in love with me.
- Oh, the ego, the conceit.
- You told me so that night.
- What?
- Not in so many words, perhaps.
But when I held you in my arms and kissed you, you clung to me.
Oh, how cruel to remind me of that.
You fooled me. You made a fool of me and you tricked me.
Manuela, all my life...
...I've searched for someone who could fill the void in my heart. I've found you.
Oh, come with me.
Once and for all, I do not love you.
I know it's hard for you to believe but I do not love you.
Then why didn't you cut that rope with your shears?
You would have been rid of me.
I wish I had now.
Now, will you get out of here?
- You won't come with me?
- No.
Very well, then.
It isn't essential for you to love me to be in the troupe.
It helps, but it isn't essential.
Get out.
- Goodbye.
- No, not that way. You'll kill yourself.
- You do care.
- No, I don't.
- You do care.
- No, I don't.
- Manuela, you love me.
- I don't.
You love me. You love me, Manuela.
You love me.
Don Pedro will take care of that mountebank.
- Who's that man with the whip?
- Manuela's fiancé.
- He's also mayor of the town.
- Mayor.
- All right, boys, start packing.
- Okay, let's go. Let's go.
I tell you you're wrong.
You're making a great mistake.
I warn you, if you stop my marriage,
I'll hate you. I'll despise you.
All I'm asking you is to appear with us once, just once.
- Sing one song.
- No.
Just to know what a thrill it is.
You were in a trance.
You couldn't hear the audience before.
You call it a thrill to live in a tent?
To be a vagabond?
- A vagabond?
- To be chased out of every town?
- You don't...
- To be looked down on by all people?
- Looked down upo...?
- Manuela.
If he finds you, he'll kill you.
Manuela. Manuela, let me in.
No. Don't... Don't come in, Don Pedro.
I'm in my wedding dress and it's bad luck to see me in my wedding dress.
Let me in.
Please. Please, get out of here.
Not unless you come with me.
You fool.
You fool.
Manuela. Are you all right?
Don Pedro, he didn't mean any harm. Please.
- Take Manuela away.
- Please, Don Pedro.
Take her away.
He didn't mean any harm.
He'll kill him.
Never mind.
He's none of our business.
He'll kill him, I know.
I know he'll kill him.
Something dreadful will happen.
You mountebank.
You thieving vagabond.
You scum, sneaking into a lady's room.
Sneaking? You can hardly call it sneaking when I walk a tightrope...
...across your main thoroughfare.
- I'll put you in irons.
I'll have you publicly flogged.
A lash across your back for every step along that rope.
- What, sir?
- This is a respectable community.
We do not entertain the scum of the cities.
The thieves, the vagabonds, such as you.
Speak more, master, speak more.
I'm mayor in this town.
My word is law.
I give you five minutes.
Exactly five minutes for you and your malodorous riffraff to get out of town.
Take your choice, get out or I'll have you mercilessly flogged.
- That voice.
- Get out.
You and your scurvy troupe of actors.
Macoco!
Merciful saints of heaven.
Does that stir old memories, Macoco?
Would you like to hear it again,
Macoco?
No. No, for the love of heaven, no.
Go away.
Go away.
- Who are you?
- I am one of your rare mistakes.
You didn't quite succeed in killing me.
Very careless of you.
Do you remember the merchant ship
Capricorn...
...you sunk off the coast of Algiers?
I happened to be on it.
I was returning from my very first theatrical engagement.
Quite successful one too.
Well, you threw me overboard and you left me thinking I had drowned...
...but it's hard to kill an actor.
Of course, I wouldn't expect you to remember me.
One victim out of so many hundreds.
But I remember you.
My heart. My heart.
Too much soft living, Macoco.
Don't say that name.
I never thought I'd live to see this day.
Mack the Black, scourge of the seven seas.
Murderer, torturer, pillager, lying quivering like a sick jellyfish.
You know, last time we met, you were lithe. You were supple. You were strong.
You could split a man in two with a stroke of your cutlass.
What do you want? I'll give you anything if you'll keep your mouth shut.
- I'll give you a thousand pesos.
- A thousand pesos.
It seems to me I remember a poster:
"Macoco. Wanted for hanging.
Reward, 100,000 pesos."
- Very well, then. 100,000.
- I'm an artist, not a blackmailer.
There's a crowd down there.
Perhaps they'd like to know their mayor.
Have you no pity? No heart?
Don't do this to me.
Look, I'm respectable now.
I've made a place for myself in this community.
I'm very philanthropic.
I repaired the church belfry.
For the love of heaven...
...have mercy on me. If not for my sake, then for Manuela's.
Look, what would she do if she knew that I were Macoco the pirate?
Yes, what would Manuela do if...
I beg you don't tell her.
Is there no compassion in your heart for a sinner who repents?
- I beg you, on my knees.
- Quiet.
I want you to go out on that balcony and announce to the town...
...that my troupe will perform tonight and you will be our patron.
Oh, be reasonable. I can't do that.
- Maco...
- No, no, no, no.
Fellow citizens.
Your attention, please.
Because this is a memorable day in my life...
...I have decided to relax my usual rule against strangers in our town.
I have decided to allow these...
These strolling players...
...to entertain us with a performance.
Thank heavens he's still alive.
Are you mad?
The man is a devil incarnate.
He'll twist anyone to his purpose.
We must get out of his reach. Capucho, tell them to bring the carriage.
Come, Manuela.
We'll take shelter in the church.
No one is to leave this house without my permission.
What right have you to give orders?
What have you done to Don Pedro?
Don Pedro is simply feeling the normal reaction to fear.
Fear? Why should he fear you?
He knows who I am.
Well, what are you?
Some pickpurse or chicken thief?
Señora, your village is isolated and remote...
...but even here you must have heard the name...
...Macoco.
Macoco?
But you can't be. You're... You're a...
A strolling player?
Manuela, even a man desperately in love has the instinct of self-preservation.
If it were known that Macoco was on this island...
...all the vultures of the Caribbean would be on my trail.
Now that you know, you must make your choice.
A life of splendid danger with me or a sorry existence with this...
...this creature.
What is he saying?
- What has he told you?
- Simply the truth.
The truth?
- What truth?
- Is it warm? Are you...? You're sweating.
What is he saying?
Whatever he's told you, it's a lie. It's a gross lie.
Are you accusing Macoco of lying?
Think twice before you answer,
Pedro or whatever you call yourself.
What? What is this?
- What are you saying?
- This fat pumpkin...
...was traveling on a ship
I captured once. I spared his life.
But I may not be so kind this time.
One word from me, you know, and you'll be hanging from a gibbet.
Please, please.
Capucho, do something.
I sense in this room an air of strangulated discomfort.
These must be relatives.
Remove them.
Yes, yes. I think you'd better go.
Go on, go on. Leave the house.
I'm telling you to leave the house.
Can't you hear me? Get out of here.
Why don't you go away?
Get out.
You should try underplaying sometime.
Very effective.
Well, Manuela, are you ready to come with me?
I have engagements on the seven seas.
Will you keep them with me?
No, no. We're not for each other.
Oh, we'll have a glorious life, the open road, the canopy of the skies.
But... I hardly know you.
I hardly know you either.
We'll have the excitement of discovery.
But I, l...
- Do you two realize that I'm in the room?
- Must I remind you...
I won't stand by and allow you to make love to my affianced wife.
You won't do what?
What won't you do?
- Lf I could see you for a moment alone...
- I have no time for sniveling cowards.
There are too many things to be done. In the first place...
...I must have accommodations for myself and my men.
I'll see what I can do for you at the inn.
We'll stay at no scurvy inn.
If I know you, you'll have the best house in town. We'll take that.
Look, be reasonable. I can't do that.
Now, please, Don Pedro, don't make him angry.
But l... We are to be married.
They are waiting for us at the church.
Oh, the marriage, the marriage.
The marriage is postponed, indefinitely.
I shall see you later.
Macoco.
He won't get away with this.
He won't get away with this.
Manuela. Manuela. Are you all right?
Halt.
Dismount.
If you're thinking of riding to the capital for help, you're idiots.
My crew and I are not alone.
The town is surrounded.
Those hills are full of my men.
Bloodthirsty men.
Cutthroats, who only await my signal to come down and lay this town to ruin.
- Hey, boss.
- Trillo.
There is no necessity of keeping up this pretense any longer.
They know that I am Macoco.
- Macoco?
- Trillo.
Go immediately to Don Pedro Vargas' house...
...and arrange our quarters. Go ahead.
Do not anger Macoco.
Do not bring down Macoco's wrath upon your heads.
Macoco!
Macoco!
Citizens of Calvados, listen carefully.
I know you do not want bloodshed.
I know you want to cooperate.
- Anything. Anything.
- Anything you ask for, reverend pirate.
Good. There is a young lady in this town who has been fortunate enough...
...to have found favor in my eyes.
I wish her to be brought to me at once.
Her name...
...is Manuela.
- Oh, no, not Manuela.
- No. Not Manuela. Oh, no.
- Please, not Manuela, reverend pirate.
- She's to be married to the mayor.
We have other girls, beautiful girls.
Suit yourself. But I warn you...
...if Manuela is not brought to me here in 10 minutes, unmarried...
...I shall set torch to your town.
Your village will lie in ruins.
Your families will be scattered to the winds.
Not one house shall be left standing, not one stone upon another.
- No. No.
- Go fetch her.
- Where is Don Pedro? We must see him.
- You cannot see Don Pedro.
- He's not to be disturbed.
- I'm sorry.
This is a matter of life and death.
- Is that the padre?
- No, it's the advocate.
- Well, somebody get the padre.
- Don Pedro, I hardly know how to begin.
- It grieves me to bear this message.
- What is it? Speak up.
- Macoco has given us an ultimatum.
- Well, well?
Manuela is to be delivered to him there within 10 minutes...
- ...or he'll put a torch to the town.
- What? What?
The brazen effrontery.
The impertinence.
You think Macoco wouldn't burn a town?
He's done it 100 times, and with far less provocation.
Where is Manuela?
Let us speak to Manue...
You will not speak of this to Manuela.
Señora, lock the door and give me the key.
It's ridiculous.
The whole thing is insane.
You go right back to him and tell him that I refuse to be intimidated.
Perhaps you would like to go to Macoco and tell him he's lying.
Yes.
That is... Well...
I tell you, he can't do anything.
He wouldn't dare.
He knows he'd hang.
Be realistic. You think threat of hanging frightens him? He practically invites it.
He's admitted that he's the pirate
Macoco. For that alone he could hang.
- Right. You're perfectly right.
- This man fears nothing.
He knows there's a price on his head and yet he boasts of his evil deeds.
He's a desperate character.
He should be killed like a dog.
Yes. He's ruthless.
We must do nothing to oppose him...
He's a menace to the whole civilized world.
Inez, the key.
I'll be back within an hour.
Where are you going?
To the capital, to get the militia.
- Militia. Oh, no, Don Pedro.
- You're going to certain death.
Macoco's men are surrounding the town.
- No one can get through.
- Don Pedro. Don Pedro.
We've wasted four minutes.
Let's go and talk to Manuela.
- Manuela.
- No, no, you're not to speak to her.
- I won't allow it.
- I'm sorry, señora.
Manuela. Manuela.
- Yes?
- Manuela, did you hear?
I couldn't help but hear a little.
It's a frightful thing to ask a young girl to sacrifice herself...
...but no one and nothing else can save us.
Manuela, don't listen to them.
Don Pedro has gone for help.
I'm sorry, señora.
Manuela, even if he could get through the hills, which he can't, it's useless.
He cannot get back for an hour at the very least...
...and we've only five minutes.
But you can't ask that of me.
You know I'd do anything in this world to save you, anything.
But you can't ask that.
Manuela, we, your fellow townspeople, are throwing ourselves on your mercy.
Will you go, Manuela?
Will you sacrifice yourself to save us?
But you're asking too much of me.
You'll go down in history, Manuela...
...another Joan of Arc...
...sacrificing herself that her people might live.
But I've only just met him.
We'll put a tablet on your door,
Manuela Alva and this date.
Who knows, we might even change the name of the town in honor of you.
Manuela, think of us, of our wives...
...and our children, the people you've known all your life.
Don't you see what this could mean to my future?
It could mean the ruination of my complete life.
Do you wanna see this town, which our grandfathers built...
...over the years with such loving care, do you want to see it ruined?
Razed, with not one stone left upon another?
Thank you, Manuela.
Manuela, all of our lives we'll thank you.
Thank you.
Manuela.
Manuela.
I can't bear to have you sacrifice yourself.
I'll do it. I'll go in your place.
He asked for me.
Well, this is what you dreamed of, isn't it?
I beg your pardon?
May I get you a cushion for your feet?
You... You... You said this is what I've dreamed of.
Don't you remember? That's what you said at the show that night.
You said you were in love with Macoco, and that you dreamt...
...that someday he'd come like a chicken hawk and carry you away.
I said that?
I said that to him?
Sure, to Serafin.
I mean...
Macoco.
Oh, yes, Macoco.
Would there be anything else,
Your Highness?
No, thank you.
I think that will be quite enough.
Well, then, if you'll excuse me,
I think I'Il...
Manuela, the time has come to drop the mask.
Macoco.
Why did you think you had to do all of these things to get me here?
Didn't you know you had only to stretch out your hand?
No, please, don't move. Don't.
I want to gaze my full at you.
That sinister brow.
The hawk-like glance in your eyes.
Those savage shoulders.
The ferocious nape of that neck.
Oh, I can see you now in battle.
The clash of angry swords, the roar of cannon and you...
You, Macoco, standing there, with lightning breaking about you...
...dominating everything.
There's something
I must tell you. Look, l...
And to think I thought you were nothing but a common actor.
How unspeakably drab.
- Just what was that you said?
- How could I have been so gullible?
I should have known from the first moment I saw you on the stage...
...that you knew absolutely nothing about acting.
- Now, look here...
- Oh, Macoco, my fabulous Macoco.
Take me away with you.
Take me away on your mighty ship.
- Just a minute. L...
- I can see us now.
You with you cutlass in one hand and your... Your compass in the other...
...shouting orders to your pirate crew.
And I, I at your side, spurring you on to greater and greater achievements.
Won't that be magnificent?
Tell me...
...just...
...what did you think was wrong with my acting?
- Your what?
- My acting. You said you thought that l...
Oh, please, let's not talk of anything so disgusting and degrading.
I despise actors.
Besides...
...you don't have to pretend with me.
I love you for what you are.
Ruthless and cruel.
Taking what you want, fearing no one.
I don't think you saw a good show that night.
My performance must have been off.
- Ordinarily, my...
- Oh, Macoco.
I could show you a review in the Trinidad Clarion about my acting...
...comparing me with David Garrick.
Oh, I wish I had that here.
- I'd like to...
- The man I love, the man I love...
...is the man who said, "Bring Manuela to me or I'll put a torch to the town."
- I have a confession to make...
- A confession?
You don't need to make a confession.
The record of your deeds is written on my heart.
Oh, yes. One crime or two crimes might be something to confess.
But crime on such a magnificent scale, why, that becomes an epic.
You transcend the petty moral codes of ordinary men.
Manuela, you must listen...
Manuela.
Oh, I see you found out.
Manuela.
Manuela, you're overwrought.
Now, I know you have every right to be vexed. But I did it for us. Manu...
Manu...
Now, Manuela. Darling. Count to 10.
Manuela.
Now, Manuela.
Manuela.
Oil on the troubled waters, Manuela.
No. Your temper.
Oh, Manuela, this is ridiculous.
Don't be a witch. Manuela.
All right, Manuela.
I apologize. I apologize.
I shouldn't have walked that tightrope to your room. I know that I should...
I realize I shouldn't have hypnotized you and made you say those things. But...
Now, look. Manuela, I'm trying to be reasonable. Can't you under... can't you see I'm trying to be big about this?
Manuela, I ask you. Please, do not...
Now, look, I've apologized abjectly.
What more can I do?
Just what more can l...
You're overdoing this.
You're being vindictive.
Now, you listen to me.
You have the manners of a spoiled brat...
...and the effrontery of an unbridled egotist.
Because I succumbed to your charm...
...don't think that I'll endure your temperament, because I won't.
That settles it. I've never yet raised my hand against a woman...
...but by heaven, you've gone too far.
En garde.
Touché.
Now, can't we talk this over like sensible adult persons?
Now, Manu...
Now, don't...
Now, listen...
Manu... Oh, don't. Don't.
You'll hurt someone.
Serafin.
Serafin, my darling.
Serafin.
Serafin, what have I done to you?
What have I done to you?
What have I done?
Serafin?
Serafin, listen to me.
I didn't mean what I said about your acting.
I think you're a wonderful actor.
Oh, darling, darling.
You can do no wrong
You're as right
As the nightingale's song
You're the nth of perfection
Of them all you're the star
When you gaze in my direction
Life is caviar
I can barely wait
Till I know that we'll share
The same fate
And from then on
Sweet angel
I shall worship you
My life long
For you can do
No wrong
It's painfully true
That you can do
No wrong
To be able to send back word that I've captured Macoco.
The news will echo round the world.
The king himself will call me back to decorate me.
I must warn you again, sir.
Macoco is very clever. He will try in every way to convince you...
...that he is not a pirate.
- It is not necessary to give me advice.
I am no novice in the affairs of government.
Sorry.
Excellency, we have found a part of his booty.
What extraordinary luck.
This is his personal chest.
It's full of jewels stolen by Macoco.
Do they tally with the East India Company?
Yes.
A great many of them, Excellency.
The maharani's diamonds and matched pearls.
The Mogul's emeralds.
The stomacher of Marie Antoinette.
- That's enough. Where is he?
- At the mayor's residence.
Surround the place.
Guard every entrance, every window.
Remember this man is the devil incarnate.
He'll strike like a cobra when he realizes he's cornered.
All right.
Surround him, men.
- Manuela. Are you all right?
- Yes.
What have you done to her?
Excellency, this is a joke, a silly joke.
Just a silly joke. This man knew that I had an admiration for Macoco.
He pretended. That's all.
You've been through a terrible experience.
But you have nothing to fear now.
Your magnificent courage has earned the gratitude of the entire island.
It's due to you that this felon has been apprehended.
Captain.
See the señorita escorted safely to her home.
No, l...
Bring the prisoner here.
Well, sir. At last.
I can't tell you what pleasure it gives me to meet you, under these conditions.
Excellency.
I must say, Macoco, you're very satisfying.
The other members of your profession, whom I've met...
...have looked more like bookkeepers than pirates.
But you.
You fill the eye.
Thank you. But I regret to disillusion you, Excellency.
I have been sailing under false colors.
I am not Macoco.
My name is Serafin and I'm an actor.
Here are my papers.
I warned you he'd do this, don't believe him.
Must I remind you I'm perfectly capable of handling this without any assistance?
Sorry.
Did you really expect to fool me with a forged passport?
This means that some poor wretch named Serafin is lying in a ditch...
...somewhere with a dagger in his throat.
Don Pedro, do you think it wise to go this far?
I'm here to see that you hang.
No doubt about that.
But His Excellency would never hang a man without evidence.
Certainly not.
Hey, wait a minute. What are you doing with that? This is my prop box.
I never allow anyone to touch this.
It holds all my professional secrets.
Macoco, in the name of His Majesty
I hereby charge you...
...with the murder of thousands of his subjects.
With theft, arson, et cetera, et cetera.
Put him in irons and issue orders to erect a gallows at once.
We'll forego the formality of a trial.
Don't take your eyes off him, not for a minute. And don't let him talk.
No, above all, don't let me talk.
Let the execution begin.
- Aunt Inez, let me through.
- You are behaving...
Please, Aunt Inez. Let me through.
I've go to stop this. Stop. Stop!
Your Excellency.
I beg you not to go on with this.
- I implore you, don't...
- Señorita. You must calm...
- Manuela.
- People. Listen, please.
A few hours ago you thanked me for saving your lives.
You told me you'd be grateful forever.
Well, now I have one favor to ask of you in return.
I beg you to stop this hanging.
This man is not a pirate.
He's only a strolling player, an actor.
He's so good an actor that you believed him...
Proceed with the execution.
Excellency.
- May I speak?
- No. No. Go on with the hanging.
Oh, I'm sorry. Should I have addressed myself to the mayor?
I had thought His Excellency, the viceroy, was in command here.
And so I am.
You may have your say.
Excellency, thank you.
I wish to express my gratitude to the señorita...
...but she is wasting her sympathies.
I agree with Don Pedro.
Macoco should hang.
You're right.
For once you're telling the truth.
Well, why are we waiting?
Get on with the hanging.
I shall try not to disappoint you.
Your Excellency, fate has been most kind to me.
In my last moments it has granted me the privilege of meeting, face to face...
...one of the great figures of our time.
Fate hasn't been unkind to me.
It's always useful, politically, you know, to capture an important criminal.
I am only too happy, Excellency, to further your career.
And I to put an end to yours.
I believe a condemned man has a right to one last request.
Well, within reason, a visit from a loved one, a prayer, a beefsteak.
I have only one burning desire.
Let me give a performance, one last performance for Your Excellency.
Oh, that's impossible.
If you escaped, I should have to consider myself a fool.
And I don't care to undervalue myself.
Excellency, I have played before the king of Spain...
...the khedive of Egypt, the bey of Tunis.
I should like, before I die, to play before Your Excellency.
But you must see it would be very irregular.
Excellency...
...you are a man of culture, a man of imagination.
When a royal banquet is spread before you...
...you do not pounce upon it like any peasant.
This is a great moment we have before us.
A moment in history.
Let's not rush at it.
Let's savor it to the full.
I never heard of such impudence, such an outrage.
Hang him. Hang him at once.
You there, soldiers, go on, take him.
Do you hear me?
Go on with the hanging.
Just a minute, Don Pedro.
Your Excellency, you don't know this man.
He's diabolically clever.
He's trying to trick you, make a fool of you.
Excellency, I await your permission.
No. No.
I'm mayor here and I forbid it.
Do you hear me? I forbid it.
He hangs. He hangs this minute.
Go on, hang him.
You may be mayor of this little village, but I am viceroy.
You may give your show.
Excellency.
Stand back, men. Give the impresario a little room.
There's something rather perverse about all this.
I shall feel like a Roman emperor of the Decadence. Rather agreeable.
It will be a pleasure to be executed by a man of such charm.
Fellow artists.
Overture. Prepare the proscenium.
Unmask this funereal garb and don the bright colors of Vespus.
On with your costume, Trillo.
- Trillo, strike up the music.
- What number will it be, captain?
Our gayest and our best to please our honored guest.
Get the mirror ready.
The mirror. I'm going to release
Don Pedro's spirit from its earthly bond.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, honored guest, in behalf of my little troupe...
...may I hope that you enjoy our farewell performance.
Of course, this is not my first farewell performance...
...but I think we can trust our honored guest to make it my last.
Usually, for our opening
I perform a rope trick...
...but tonight, under the circumstances,
I will skip the rope.
Instead,
I and my two brilliant colleagues...
...in the art of terpsichore will entertain you.
But first, if you will allow me,
I shall get away from this noose.
As me mother used to say,
"No noose is good noose."
I'll remember forever
When I was but 3
Mama, who was clever
Remarking to me
Son, when you've grown up
And you want everything nice
I've got your future sewn up
If you'll take this advice
Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
Act the fool, play the calf
And you'll always have the last laugh
Wear the cap and the bells
And you'll rate with all the great swells
If you become a doctor,
Folks 'll face you with dread
If you become a dentist
They'll be glad when you're dead
You'll get a bigger hand
If you can stand on your head
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown
Oh, bravo. Bravo.
Thank you. Thank you.
That was merely an appetizer.
Your Excellency, now we come to the pinnacle of our entertainment...
...an experiment in the new, sensational science of animal magnetism...
...taught me by the great
Mesmer himself.
Oh, Mesmer. I knew him very well.
I was fascinated by his science.
Then, of course, Your Excellency knows the principles of the great Mesmer.
In short...
...hypnosis.
Hypnosis.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, before your very eyes...
...I shall perform this experiment.
I shall need someone to help me, but it must be the right person.
Control cannot be exercised over everyone.
I have failed with the confused, with the rebellious, with the recalcitrant.
To perform the experiment ideally...
...I must find a person whose character and background are above reproach.
I see we have a volunteer.
We'll have none of that here, young man.
Señora, you have spoiled what promised to be a very interesting experiment.
Your Excellency, you do not realize.
This man has powers that are...
Quiet. Quiet. Stand back.
Don't speak to her.
If you wake her, it may kill her.
She's in a trance.
Oh, Manuela, not again.
Come, pure spirit. Come with me.
- I forbid it. It's a disgrace.
- Sit down, Don Pedro.
Gracious lady, if you have any wish...
...express it freely to me.
I who am your friend.
- I wish th...
- Yes?
- I wish...
- Black magic.
I won't have him practice black magic on my future wife.
- It's an outrage.
- Hold your tongue, Don Pedro.
I will not have this performance ruined by your possessiveness.
Excellency, will you please tell him this is not flirtation, it is science?
- It is science.
- Whatever. I don't like it.
I demand that you hold your tongue.
Proceed, sir, with your mesmerism.
Manuela, are you afraid?
No, no.
What is your wish, Manuela?
What is your wish?
I ask for very little...
...only to be allowed...
...to worship at your feet, Macoco.
My prince of pirates.
Let them do with you what they will.
It makes no difference.
Your spirit and your legend will live on through the ages.
Oh, I worship you for your immortal deeds, your fearlessness, your daring.
Destiny has been harsh.
It has given me the vision of you, only to snatch it away...
...but I shall carry your image in my heart, cherishing it, loving it.
I shall dedicate my life to the memory of you.
But, Manuela, you are to be married to Don Pedro, the most pious...
...the most upright...
- The most piddling of all men.
A namby-pamby who dares not leave this village...
...a catchpenny who's afraid even of the sea.
Oh, but you, Macoco.
You, you have slashed across this world...
...your bold pattern of imagination.
You are a glorious prism that dazzles me...
...with all of its facets.
Love of my life
Life of my love
I used to pray
And pray you'd hear me
Love of my life
Angels above
Sent you at last
To stay always near me
Now we are one
Never to part
And nevermore
Need I implore you
To miss me
Come to my arms
Come to my heart
Kiss me
Kiss me
Come to me
Come to me
Love of my life
Macoco!
I've had enough of this.
This marionette, strutting around pretending to be the Black Macoco.
Do you think a runt like that could handle a crew of cutthroats?
Do you think real men would risk their necks to serve under him?
If you want to worship Macoco, then worship me.
It was I who was the terror of the Caribbean.
The most feared and hated man who ever sailed a ship.
At the mere mention of my name...
...armed fleets would slink into their harbors.
Whole populations would flee to the hills...
...when my ship came in sight of land...
...my name was like thunder, rolling in from the sea.
I am this man you worship.
I am Macoco.
Not this greasepaint hero.
This puny, rabbit-hearted, white-livered buffoon.
I am Macoco.
Ladies and gentlemen, don't move, don't stir, the best is still to come.
We have a new star in our brilliant galaxy of players...
...the beautiful, the beguiling, the divine Manuela.
Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
Show 'em tricks
Tell 'em jokes
And you'll only stop with top folks
Dress in huge, baggy pants
And you'll ride the road to romance
A butcher or a baker
Ladies never embrace
A barber for a beau
Would be a social disgrace
They all'll come to call
If you can fall on your face
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown
Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
Be a crazy buffoon
And the demoiselles 'll all swoon
Be a crack jackanapes
And they'll imitate you like apes
Why be a great composer
With your rent in arrears?
Why be a major poet
And you'll owe it for years
When crowds 'll pay to giggle
If you wiggle your ears?
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown
Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
Be the poor silly ass
And you'll always travel first class
Give 'em quips, give 'em fun
And they'll pay to say you're A- 1
If you become a farmer
You've the weather to buck
If you become a gambler
You'll be stuck with your luck
But jack, you'll never lack
If you can quack like a duck
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown
Be a clown, be a clown
Be a clown

Our state fair is a great state fair
Don't miss it
Don't even be late
It's dollars to doughnuts that our state fair
Is the best state fair in our state
Our state fair is a great state fair
Don't miss it
Don't even be late
It's dollars to doughnuts that our state fair
Is the best state fair in our state
Take it easy, Blue Boy. Your supper will be here any minute.
I wish I knew what was keeping that feller.
Our state fair is a great state fair
Don't miss it
Don't even be late
It's dollars to doughnuts that our state fair
Is the best state fair in our state
WOMAN: Dad! Daddy, I just had
Mr. Cramer on the phone.
He said Dave Miller stopped by his place 10 minutes ago
- to put water in his radiator.
- Thanks, daughter.
Margy?
- Have you finished your packing?
- Not yet. I was just going to.
I don't know what's got into you lately.
All you do is sit around and mope.
I don't sit around and mope.
Well, stop moping now and finish your packing.
Always saying she doesn't know what's got into me.
I'll be glad to get to the fair, hear something different, see something different for a change.
What has got into me, anyway?
The things I used to like
I don't like anymore
I want a lot of other things
I've never had before
It's just like Mother says
I sit around and mope
Pretending I am wonderful
And knowing I'm a dope
- WOMAN: Margy?
- Yes, Mother?
As soon as you're finished, I want you to come down and help me with the pickles.
In a minute, Mother.
Pickles!
I'm as restless as a willow
In a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet
On a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring
I'm starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have spring fever
When it isn't even spring
I keep wishing
I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange, new street
Hearing words that
I have never heard
From a man I've yet to meet
I'm as busy as a spider
Spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud
Ora robin on the wing
But I feel so gay
In a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring
It might as well be
Spring
WOMAN: Margy!
I'm coming, Mother.
Come on, boy.
Ah, he'll win first this year sure.
He's half again the hog he was last year.
You don't really expect to win, do you, with that animated lard can?
Say, listen, you can say anything you please about me, but don't say anything bad about Blue Boy.
That's the finest Hampshire boar that ever breathed.
If you think that, he's just as good as beat now.
Be better if he was third or fourth best.
- He'd stand a better chance.
- What are you talking about?
If a hog or a man ever got what he was entitled to just once, the eternal stars would quit making melody in the spheres.
Oh, there you go with that book talk again.
I say he's the best hog in the state, and the judges will say so too.
They might.
But if that turns out good, then something else will probably happen.
- He might catch pneumonia...
- Oh! or hog cholera, or you might catch pneumonia.
Or something might happen to Wayne or Margy.
Oh!
Mark my words, Abel, there's compensation in this world.
For every good, there's bad. Now,
Ralph Waldo Emerson tells us...
I don't care what
Waldo Emerson tells us!
Look, I'll just make a little bet with you.
- On what?
- I'll bet you we go to the fair... and Blue Boy will win the grand award.
And nothing bad will happen to him, me or my family.
Yes, and we'll all have a good time too and be better off for it after the fair is over.
It's a foolish bet, Abel. If you'd asked me, I'd have given you 10-to-1.
But you didn't ask me, so it's an even bet.
- Five dollars?
- Five dollars is right.
I'll be around for the money the day you get back.
- Be around with the money, you mean.
- You'll see. You'll see.
Yeah, I'll see.
Well, well, what's this?
You got your chains on.
You expecting a shower?
Nope. I'm expecting good weather.
That's why I put my chains on, so I wouldn't be fooled.
Do you want your name "Mrs. Abel
Frake" or "Mrs. Melissa Frake"?
Melissa Frake, I guess. With your father entering Blue Boy, the judges might get us mixed.
ABEL: Hog cholera, pneumonia.
He left out earthquakes, the old gloom spreader.
Poor Dad.
Mmm, I don't know.
Let me taste.
- Don't taste like Grandma Stidger's.
- I followed her recipe.
- I'll get it.
- You left something out.
Abel Frake, I am not gonna put liquor into my cooking!
Making mincemeat without brandy?
No such thing.
I don't approve of it, and I won't do it.
Well, you'll be sorry. You know, those judges at the fair, they like a little snifter now and then.
- It's Eleanor, for Wayne.
- Wayne's out back somewhere.
I'll find him.
Why don't you say hello to Eleanor, Ma?
See how her mother is. You know, they had the doctor again this morning.
- I suppose I should.
- Find out if she's going to the fair.
Yes, I will.
Hello, Eleanor. How are you, dear?
How's your mother feeling?
Yes, I know. I'm sorry I couldn't get by to see her today, but I've been so busy getting ready to leave and all.
Oh, well, I'm glad she's better, dear.
Wayne'll be here any moment.
Just hold on.
And be sure to give my love to your mother.
Thank you, dear. Good-bye.
- Abel?
- Hmm?
I need a good-sized box, or cotton.
Something to carry my pickles in.
Know just what you want, Ma.
I'll get it for you right away.
"Stir in apples and molasses, spices, lemons..."
"Two parts good brandy."
No, I won't!
- Eph, where's Wayne?
- Wayne? He's back there in the barn.
MAN: Thank you, mister.
And now, I think I'll have a try at that fancy brass clock.
Yes, that one.
- There ya are.
- Wayne?
There's a nice string of pearls.
I think I'll have a go at them.
- Oh, I know they're fakes, but...
- Wayne!
What are you doing?
- How long you been there?
- Just a little while.
Why didn't you say somethin' instead of just standing there?
Who were you talking to?
And does Mother know you have her embroidery hoops out here?
Look, just leave me alone, will ya?
And stop prying in other people's affairs.
Speaking of affairs,
Eleanor's on the phone.
Eleanor? Well, Christmas!
Why didn't you tell me?
Eleanor's on the phone.
Hello, Eleanor? Hi, honey. What'd the doctor say about your mother? Can you go?
Well, I don't know what to do, Wayne.
The doctor said she's a little better, but...
Oh, but, Eleanor, you've got to go!
I've made a lot of plans for us. What?
I keep wishing
I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange, new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a man
I've yet to meet
He would be a kind of handsome combination
Of Ronald Colman Charles Boyer
And Bing
RONALD COLMAN'S VOICE:
Margy. My dear, little Margy.
I'd make the world a ruby for your little finger and say,
"I love you.
I love you. I love you."
CHARLES BOYER'S VOICE:
Ah, Margy. You are beautiful.
You are so very beautiful.
BING CROSBY: And we feel so gay
In a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring
MAN: Margy!
- Hello, Margy.
- Hello, Harry.
No, I'm not mad.
I'm just disappointed.
Well, I'll see you when I get back.
Good-bye.
Gee, I wish I was going to the fair with you tonight.
I'd rather be doing that than anything I know.
- Oh, would you, Harry?
- Well, sure.
- Only I can't neglect my cows.
- Oh. Of course not.
- Say, I saw something today.
- What?
The sweetest bit of farmland this side of Davenport.
I was thinking of puttin' a bid in on it if you like it.
- If I like it?
- Well, sure.
You know I haven't made a plan since I was
12 years old that didn't include you.
- Got a house on it?
- Yeah, but it's too old.
- We'd have to build a new one.
- Oh, I like old houses.
It wouldn't fit in with our kind of farm.
You know, I plan to do everything my old man won't let me do on his place.
Scientific irrigation, electric milking, separate hen roosts.
No horses. All tractor power.
- You see what I mean? Everything modern.
- But the house you live in...
It's gotta be the same. No clapboard and shingle business.
There's a new kind of plastic, prefabricated job.
I want you to see it.
Got the catalog at home.
- Is it pretty?
- Sure!
But what's more important, it's termite-proof.
Wait till you see it. And they tell you how to furnish it too.
No rugs or carpets.
They're just dust collectors.
- What's on the floor?
- Linoleum through the whole house.
Wait till you see the pictures. It's slick and smooth and easy to keep clean.
Well, it's like every room in the house was a bathroom.
- Sounds real cozy.
- Yeah, don't it, though?
- What I've always wanted.
- Oh, sure. It's the only way to live.
- Everything's sanitary.
- Sure.
- And if we had children...
- Oh, Margy!
I said if by any strange chance we had children, why, I could dress them in cellophane rompers.
Say, I didn't know they had...
Life will just be ducky...
In our air-conditioned patent-leather farmhouse
Plastic.
On our ultramodern scientific farm
We'll live in a streamlined heaven
And we'll waste no time on charm
No geraniums to clutter our veranda
Nor a single, little sentimental thing
No Virginia creepers
Nothing useless
- What's the matter, honey?
- Oh, nothing.
Just restless, I guess.
Sure. I understand.
You like to travel.
Well, I figured we'd make a little trip, California or Bermuda or... if it was May, we could go to
Washington, see the cherry trees.
- A honeymoon?
- That's what.
I'd almost marry you to make the trip, Harry.
No kiddin' now, Margy. What do you say? What do you say?
Well, I won't say anything just now, Harry.
- Well, after the fair, maybe?
- Maybe.
Wow!
Look at him, Marge!
Holy cow! Gets bigger every time I see him.
Biggest boar in the world, I bet.
All depends on how you spell it.
Eleanor can't go.
- Where's your mincemeat, Ma?
- Right here between my feet.
- Is the top on tight?
- Certainly, it's on tight.
- Why?
- Oh, nothin'.
Just don't want the flavor to escape, that's all.
- Hello, Miss Frake!
- Hello, there!
- How are you?
- Just fine.
We'll come see you as soon as we get settled.
Yes, do that.
If Wayne doesn't come back soon to take me around, I'm going by myself.
I do wish your father would come to his breakfast.
If he'd rather stay with Blue
Boy than eat, well, let him.
But I've got my whole day planned out.
Don't you know you can't plan out a whole day?
- There's no such thing.
- I do it all the time.
You sound just like Harry. He thinks you can plan out your whole life.
So you can.
Is that what he was talking about yesterday?
Uh-huh.
Did you come to anything definite?
Uh-uh.
I don't know what you're waiting for.
It would serve you right if Harry up and married that Skidmore girl instead of you.
I almost hope he does.
Me too.
MAN: Step right up, ladies and gentlemen.
Move in a little closer.
Don't be afraid.
Hurry, hurry! Play the game!
Three rings for a dime.
Prizes worth up to $20.
Positively no blanks. The prize you win is the prize you get, the prize you take away.
Don't any gentleman want to try his skill?
Ain't nobody here got the pioneer spirit?
I tell you what I'm going to do.
I'm goin' to put down three nice, new, crisp one-dollar bills.
One here, one here, and one here.
Now, who will spend a dime for three chances at $3.00?
Is that real money?
If you win 'em and you don't like 'em, buddy,
I'll give you a dollar apiece for 'em.
Hey, mister, them hoops look mighty small.
- Do they fit over those things?
- Lots of people do it, sir.
- Lots of people do it.
- Yeah, I did it last year.
Remember me? I won a pearl-handled revolver.
Well, now, there. You see?
Young Mr. Daniel Boone here won a revolver off me right at this very fair a year ago.
Bring down any grizzly bears with that shootin' iron, sonny?
- (LAUGHING)
- Tell you what I'll do with you.
I'll just give you three rings on the house to start things off.
Three chances for nothing.
I can't win. I can only lose.
But I love the game.
Remember, young man, you're enjoying the courtesy of the house.
Don't cost us money.
(LAUGHS) I just lost $2.00!
But I'm having fun.
I love the game.
Here, my boy. I want you to have a fair shake.
That ring looks warped.
Try this one.
This one's all right.
Well, well, you all see how easy it is.
- Who else wants to try?
- I'll try again. Here's a dime.
- Who else wants a chance at a big prize?
- Here, mister, here's my dime.
How about you, sir? You look like you've got a good aim.
- Why, you got a customer.
- Give me three rings. Here's my dime.
- He's trying to dodge the boy!
- (VOICES OVERLAPPING)
- All right, buddy. Here ya are.
- You didn't put any dollar bills back.
Ain't pearl necklaces and safety razors good enough for ya?
Can't you enjoy the game for the game's sake?
- Are ya money mad?
- (LAUGHTER)
Those prizes are all fakes, but I'll win 'em anyway just to prove it.
(LAUGHS) Quite a character.
Step up, folks.
We're havin' fun here.
Just lost a pearl necklace, but I'm laughing.
(LAUGHS) I love the game.
Why, the young man is winnin' a fortune.
- Here you are, buddy.
- Look, pot metal molded in one piece.
What good's a vanity case it won't even open?
Okay, fella, you had your fun.
Now, come on. Move along.
And those clocks, they don't have any works.
What good are they?
Listen, kid, you know what
I'm payin' for this pitch?
- No. What?
- More dough than you'll ever see.
So you spend a dime, take $3.00 in cash and then try to tell the public my prizes are no good!
Well, they aren't.
They're just a lot of junk.
Look, you, I've been nice just long enough.
- Now, beat it, or I'll call a policeman.
- WOMAN: Why don't you?
- What's that?
- I said, why don't you call a policeman?
He's only trying to bluff you.
The law says he's got to sell you all the rings you want.
- Otherwise, you can close up his place.
- Oh, a smart dame, huh?
A law student. Now, you listen to me, Arsenic and Glamour,
- I don't know who you are...
- I'll tell you who I am.
My father's the chief of police here.
- Your father is...
- The chief of police.
I was standing here and saw the whole thing.
Say, how did you get so good at this?
It's kind of a silly thing to be good at, isn't it? But he made me sore last year.
I was trying for one of those pearl-handled revolvers.
It cost me about $8.00. When I finally did win it, it wasn't a revolver at all.
- It wouldn't even shoot. It was just a toy.
- Oh, ho!
- Defrauding the public, huh?
- Now, look, wait a minute.
I wouldn't have minded that so much, but he kidded me in front of the crowd.
- So I...
- You practiced all year just to get even?
That's right. I figured I'd come back and make as big a fool out of him
- as he made out of me.
- Oh, no, you don't.
Will you give him $8.00 back if he promises to lay off?
- Look, you, I don't care who your father is.
- Okay.
Here. Here, here.
Here's your eight bucks, and you don't come back, see?
- Is it a deal?
- Think it's all right to take it?
Well, sure, it's all right.
Here you are. Good-bye.
Good-bye!
- (LAUGHING)
- Oh, don't leave, folks. Prizes up to $20.
- Ah!
- Step right up, ladies and gentlemen!
We're having fun here!
Gee, it was swell of you to stand up for me like that. Thanks.
Well, that's all right.
He had it coming to him.
Well, uh, now that you helped me get my money back, how about helping me spend it?
- No, that won't be necessary.
- What about a frozen custard?
- No, thank you. I believe not.
- Hot dog?
No. Really, I have an appointment.
I'm late already.
Won't I see you again? How about tonight?
Will you be on the midway?
Tonight? Yes, I think so.
I hope so.
I'll sure be looking for you.
- Do that. Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
You sure you won't change your mind?
How about some popcorn?
MAN: Get tickets now if you care to ride.
Train's now ready to leave.
Get your tickets for this ride.
All aboard if you care to ride.
- The train is now...
- One, please.
Please get tickets for this ride.
It's the longest, the highest, the fastest, the safest ride at the fairground.
Get tickets now if you care to ride.
Hey, Pappy, there aren't any seats together.
Oh. Say, mister, do you mind sitting in the seat behind?
Thanks a lot.
Thanks.
- All aboard!
- Okay. There they go! Hold your seats.
They're off on a race through the clouds. A thrill a minute!
- (SCREAMS)
- Sit down!
What are you trying to do, get yourself killed?
I'm sorry.
Haven't you ever been on one of these things before?
Not since I was a little girl.
- I used to be afraid of them.
- But you're not now.
That's what I wanted to find out.
Here comes another dip.
It's nearly over now.
Here's the tunnel.
GIRL: Johnny, stop that!
Everybody out, folks.
Everybody out.
- I'm going around again.
- You gotta have a ticket.
- Press pass.
- Oh.
- Is the lady going around again too?
- No, thanks. I've had enough.
MAN: The safest ride at the fair.
Get tickets now for this ride.
Go and get tickets for this ride.
It is the longest, fastest thrill ride at the fairgrounds.
Get tickets now if you care to ride.
MAN 2:
Three rings for a dime. Hurry.
- You feel safer down here?
- Oh!
- I thought you were...
- I changed my mind.
I was standing there watching you walk away.
Every step you took, your hair bounced up and down on the back of your neck.
It was really nice. I don't know if that's what got me, but here I am.
Now it's your turn to say something.
What can I say? I don't know you.
- I can arrange that.
- And all you know about me is that my hair bounces up and down when I walk.
- Everybody's hair bounces up and down.
- Mine doesn't.
I mean, girls.
Well, look over there.
Well, maybe it wasn't your hair. Maybe it was the way you held your shoulders.
- Walk away again. Let me see.
- All right.
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!
- Where are you going?
- You told me to walk away.
- Yeah, but I...
- Really, I have to go anyway.
- Why?
- Well, I...
Well, what? What are you afraid of?
- I'm not afraid of anything.
- Good.
Then what would be wrong with you and me sitting down over there and exchanging our ideas of life over a Coke?
Nothing wrong. It's just that...
I'm not saying it's a great idea.
I'm just asking what's bad about it.
What could we lose? Let's give it five minutes. What do you say?
Here we are, two people who know nothing about each other.
Maybe we should. Maybe it would be fun to find out what we're like.
- Maybe it'll be dull.
- What do we do if it's dull?
- We break it up.
- How do we do that?
One of us just says, "Let's break it up." That's the end.
You go east, I go west. No hard feelings. No questions asked.
- Ag reed?
- Ag reed.
Okay. Here we go.
Hold on! Here we go!
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a man I've yet to meet
Now, with rolly coasters, that's different. They're fun.
You oughta see the one in New York.
There's one in Chicago that's pretty good.
There's one out at the beach in Los Angeles.
It's not bad, but the one in New York, the one across the river, that's the one.
- It's got a dip of 200 feet.
- You've been everywhere, haven't you?
Not yet. When I first started out in this game,
I worked around on different papers.
But now, I'm afraid the great Des
Moines Register's got me hog-tied.
Someday, I'll work on a bigger paper though.
I'm sure you will.
Well, I think I'd better go the rest of the way alone.
I'd have a pretty hard time explaining you to my folks.
Yeah, I guess you would. Everybody has a hard time explaining me.
- See you again?
- Well, I...
Or would you like to say,
"Let's break it up"?
Oh, no! Well, I mean, do you?
Look, bobbylocks, don't worry about me.
Anytime I wanna throw in the sponge, you'll know it.
I just won't be around.
Well, I don't know what the family's plans are for tonight.
- I don't know where I'll be.
- I'll find you.
- How?
- I'm a newspaperman.
It's my job to find the right people at the right time.
You'll be seeing me. So long.
So long.
What's the matter with you?
What's the trouble, Blue Boy?
Ain't you feelin' good?
This ain't like you, son.
- Ain't sick, is he?
- Huh?
Sick? Oh, no, no.
He's in fine shape.
Just had a long trip. Kind of resting up a bit, that's all.
Oh. I thought he was sick.
Oh, no. He's never felt better in his life.
You see what a spectacle you made of yourself?
What are people gonna say about you?
- Hello, Hank.
- Hello, there.
- What you got this year?
- Never you mind.
She'll put anything you've got in the shade. You wait and see.
- Come on. Get along, there. Get along.
- Hello, Hank.
Hello, there, Frake. How are ya?
Ah. You got a duroc this time, huh?
- And a good one too. Get in there.
- She's got nice color.
Well, she oughta have.
Her mother before her was the most beautiful red sow in the whole world.
- What's her name?
- Esmeralda.
- And she'll win the sweepstakes sure.
- (GRUNTING)
Now you look like something.
I don't mind telling you, though, you had me worried, son, but I knew you'd come through.
Now you look like a real champion.
- Oh! Excuse me.
- Oh!
Why don't you look where you're goin'?
Gawking around like that, people'll think you've never been to a fair before.
I just thought we might meet somebody we know.
- So what?
- Well, why are you looking around?
Who are you looking for?
I sort of had a half date, with a guy I met here last year.
- Why don't you keep it?
- What would I do with you?
- Well, look, Wayne...
- MAN: I beg your pardon, sir.
- May I trouble you for a match?
- Sure.
- I think I have some right here.
- That's very kind of you.
Okay.
- Here you are. Thanks.
- Why don't you keep them?
- My brother has another pack.
- Sure, sure. Go ahead.
- That's okay.
- Thank you very much.
- You're certainly big with my matches.
- What do you care?
Your pockets are always full of them.
Look, Wayne, if you really wanna keep your date with that friend, I wouldn't mind.
- You wouldn't?
- No.
I hardly slept a wink in that old truck last night.
What I really wanted to do tonight was to go to bed early but I didn't wanna disappoint you.
Oh, don't worry about me.
Uh, maybe you'd better.
You do look a little tired.
- And I can get back all right.
- Ah, that's swell, sis.
Thanks. I mean, get a good rest now.
I will.
Hello.
MAN: Take home a beautiful pennant from the state fair.
Come right over. Help yourself.
Oh, pardon me. I'm looking for the chief of police's daughter.
- Have you seen her around here anyplace?
- His daughter?
I don't believe I know her.
There's the chief over there.
Why don't you ask him?
Okay. Thank you.
- Good evening, Chief.
- Good evening, son. What can I do for you?
Could you tell me where your daughter is?
I sort of had a date to meet her here tonight.
- What?
- Well, it wasn't exactly a date.
She said... I mean, I told her...
Well, let's see.
She's around here somewhere.
Oh, Violet?
Yes, Daddy?
This young gentleman tells me you two have a date to go out stepping tonight.
Huh?
Well, I guess I must mean her sister.
I haven't got a sister.
Looks like someone's been pulling your leg, my boy.
Yeah. That's a pretty good joke on me, all right.
Well, thanks.
How many, please?
- Huh?
- How many tickets?
Oh. One.
MAN: And now for your favorite, the lovely Emily Edwards, and That's For Me.
Right
Between the eyes
Quite a belt
That blow I felt this morning
Fate
Gave me no warning
Great
Was my surprise
I saw you standing in the sun
And you were something to see
I know what I like and I liked what I saw
And I said to myself that's for me
A lovely morning I remarked
And you were quick to agree
You wanted to walk and I nodded my head
As I breathlessly said
That's for me
I left you standing under stars
The day's adventures are through
There's nothing for me but the dream in my heart
And the dream in my heart
That's for you
Oh, my darling
That's for you
- There you are.
- Thank you.
- Who's that singing?
- That's Emily Edwards.
She's kind of cute, but she's not my type.
She's a redhead.
Now, with brown hair, that's different.
- Hello, Pat.
- Hi, Pat.
- Hi, girls.
- How are you doin', honey?
- Quiet, you.
- I guess you know a lot of girls, don't you?
Well, in my racket, you know...
For you
- I, uh, just spoke to your father.
- My who?
Your father. You know, the chief of police.
Oh, that. Didn't you know
I was kidding?
Well, I do now.
And just for that, you're gonna have to have a drink with me.
When I first saw you up there,
I couldn't believe you were the same girl.
Why not? Was I that bad?
I didn't mean it that way.
You were good, wonderful.
That's just it. A girl singer like you with Tommy Thomas's band,
I couldn't figure out why you went to all that trouble today just for me.
- Why shouldn't I? What's wrong with you?
- Oh, nothing wrong with me.
I mean, well, maybe there is, but don't tell me.
- Like to dance?
- Uh-huh. Do you?
Sure. That's why
I brought it up. Sure.
- We can get our drinks later.
- All right.
MAN:
The big feature ride of the fair.
Get your tickets for the next ride.
This is the highest, fastest, safest ride at the fairgrounds.
Get tickets now for the big, fast ride.
- Come on. I dare you.
- I'm game.
- MAN: How many?
- Two, please.
- What you thinking about?
- Why?
Oh, you sort of had a funny smile on your face.
- You really want to know?
- Uh-huh.
Well, I was just thinking about you practicing all that time with your mother's embroidery hoops just to get even with somebody.
I guess you think I'm kind of screwy, don't you?
No, I don't. I don't at all.
As a matter of fact,
I like that kind of a fellow.
That's lucky for me, because
I like the kind of a girl who likes that kind of fellow.
MARTY:
It's a grand night for singing
The moon is flying high
And somewhere a bird who is bound he'll be heard ls throwing his heart at the sky
It's a grand night for singing
The stars are bright above
The earth is aglow and to add to the show
I think I am falling in love
Falling
Falling in love
It's a grand night for singing
The stars are bright above
The earth is aglow and to add to the show
I think I am falling in love
Falling
Falling in love
Maybe it's more than the moon
Maybe it's more than the birds
Maybe it's more than the sight of the night
In a light too lovely for words
Maybe it's more than the earth
Shiny in silvery blue
Maybe the reason
I'm feeling this way
Has something to do with you
Say, you're pretty good in that voice department yourself.
I'm an old glee club boy.
The moon is flying high
And somewhere a bird who is bound he'll be heard ls throwing his heart at the sky
It's a grand night for singing
The stars are bright above
The earth is aglow and to add to the show
I think I am falling in love
Falling
Falling in love
It's a grand night for singing
The moon is flying high
And somewhere a bird who is bound he'll be heard
Is throwing his heart at the sky
It's a grand night for singing
The stars are bright above
The earth is aglow and to add to the show
I think I am falling in love
Falling
Falling in love
And you were something to see
I know what I like and I liked what I saw
And I said to myself that's for me
A lovely morning I remarked
And you were quick to agree
You wanted to walk and I nodded my head
As I breathlessly said
That's for me
BOTH:
I left you standing under stars
- The day's adventures are through
- Ow!
There's nothing for me but the dream in my heart
And the dream in my heart that's
For you
Oh, my darling
That's
For you
Hey, cut that out!
I'll get you for that. You wait and see now. You just wait.
You two sound like you had a wonderful time last night.
- Sure did.
- Mmm, terrific.
Wish your father was enjoying himself instead of brooding over that old pig.
Say, I thought you were going to bed early last night.
Oh. Well, I was going to, but I changed my mind.
I went for a ride on the roller coaster.
- It's much better than it was last year.
- Oh, okay.
I tell you, he's raring to go.
When I left him just now, he was strutting around prouder than a peacock.
- You'd think he owned the place.
- Thank goodness.
Maybe now you'll give me a little time.
Yes, sir, he's all right.
Wait till you see him.
There ain't a hog ever was or ever will be that can touch him.
For what we're about to receive,
O Lord, make us duly thankful. Amen.
- You said grace before, Daddy.
- Yeah.
I did? Well, I'm going to keep on saying it all day.
I just hope he stays like he is till the judges see him!
Why, they hardly tasted them!
And I like my sweet pickles best.
They don't have to taste much.
They're experts.
Don't be so jittery, Mother.
- There's that Mrs. Metcalfe.
- Hmm?
- Behind the lady in the red hat.
- Oh, yes, I see her.
So biggety. Why, she was just lucky last year.
Her pies weren't half as good as yours.
- Why, hello, Mrs. Metcalfe. Pardon me.
- Hello.
Going to win all the prizes again this year?
I don't know about all, but I have high hopes for my pickles and mincemeat.
Same as you.
- (MUNCHING)
- Look. They like your sour pickles.
This is the last year I'm ever gonna enter anything.
- It isn't worth it.
- Oh, Mother, you say that every year.
Please. (WHISPERING)
Thank you.
Well, aren't they going to announce their decision?
Not until they finish with the mincemeat.
Thank you.
I don't remember telling you to cover this part of the fair.
Hello, boss.
Thought you were specializing in human interest stories on the midway.
What's wrong with putting in a plug for the housewives of our state?
That, my friend, is Mrs. America.
Do tell. And what dainty putter-upper of what delicious preserve is the cause of your presence here?
Look, forget you're the managing editor of a newspaper and try to act intelligent.
Have you ever seen me with the type who's a good cook?
No, but I've seen you with every other kind.
You had to get around to these sometime.
Shove off. Let me finish this story. It's for your paper.
Sure. Only I hope it's better than the one you turned in last night,
"Fun on a Roller Coaster." Ouch.
Boy, you'd better hope the old man misses that one or he'll never give you a shot at that job in Chicago.
That's yours, isn't it?
Mmm.
Do you think they liked it?
They must have. They certainly ate enough.
MAN: (OVER P.A.)
Your attention, please.
Silence, please. ladies and gentlemen.
Quiet, please!
We are now ready to announce the awards. Sweet pickles.
First prize to Mrs. Edwin
Metcalfe of Pottsville.
Second prize to...
To Mrs. Agnes Field of Arcadia.
Sour pickles.
First prize to
Mrs. Melissa Frake of Brunswick.
Oh, Mother.
Second prize to
Mrs. Edwin Metcalfe.
And now, ladies and gentlemen...
Quiet, please. As you know, we occasionally give a plaque for distinguished achievement.
As you are doubtlessly aware, this plaque is only given in rare cases.
And on this occasion, my colleagues and I have voted unanimously that it be given to a lady who has concocted the most delicious, the most succulent and spiciest mincemeat ever entered in a state fair.
- (GASPS)
- The lady who wins this distinction is none other than Mrs.
Melissa Frake of Brunswick.
- Oh, Mother! Oh!
- Congratulations. I'm so glad.
I've got the most a woman can get in life, Margy.
- If I think any more about it, I'll cry.
- Stand where you are, please.
Hold it. Thank you.
Thank you very much, ladies.
Your picture will appear in the
Register tomorrow morning.
Good day.
- See, Mother? You're famous.
- I'm worn out.
I'm going up to the trailer and lie down.
I never knew what a strain it was to get something you really wanted.
- I'll take these, dear.
- Oh, my hat too.
Now you run along and enjoy yourself.
My horse is number 8,
Tessie In the green shirt.
Come on, Tessie! Come on!
Get up there. Come on!
Attagirl, Tessie.
Pass her! Pass her!
Attagirl, Tess!
Oh, she made it!
She won! She won!
Oh, Pat, your horse won! it can't be much fun for you just hanging around waiting to catch me between songs.
Can't think of anything
I'd rather be doing.
Anyway, we can... I mean, can we go someplace after the show?
I thought maybe we'd have something to eat or something.
Well, I can't tonight, Wayne.
- It's Marty's birthday.
- Who's Marty?
The boy I sing with in the band. We're giving a surprise party for him.
Wouldn't you like to come?
I was kind of counting on being alone with you.
I know. I'd like that better too.
But this is a party we cooked up a week ago.
We're giving it in my rooms at the hotel
- so I can't very well back out now.
- MAN: Hey, Emily.
- They're playing the introduction.
- All right, Marty.
Now don't go away.
I'll be right back.
Okay, let's go.
Listen, kids, I got the greatest number here...
McGee, if you ever scare me like that again...
I got the greatest number I ever plugged, and I'm gonna give you first crack at it.
Buzz off, McGee. We're busy.
Eh, just like all singers, they don't like songs.
- Hi, buddy.
- Hello.
- You in the music business?
- No. I'm a farmer.
A farmer. What a night I'm having.
Well, uh, you're a friend of Emily's, ain't ya?
That's right.
- My name's McGee.
- My name's Wayne Frake.
- You in the music business?
- Yeah, I'm a song plugger.
- I work on songs till they get popular.
- How do you mean work on 'em?
I thought songs got popular because people like 'em.
That's naive. How can people like a song if they don't hear it?
You got to get the big singers to sing it first.
How do you do that?
There's all kinds of ways, and none of them is easy.
You got no idea what a snook like me has to do to get a song on the hit parade.
Last week I fell down in front of Dinah Shore's taxi just to get in conversation with her.
Every Christmas, I got to remember to send Sinatra a new bow tie.
When a bandleader's wife has a baby,
I gotta stay home with it on the nurse's night out.
It's a big question whether Mairzy
Doats would have been a hit if I hadn't had known how to change a "didey."
- Is that a new song you got there?
- Yeah, and it's a honey.
A natural for your friend Emily.
You wouldn't wanna help me get it to her, would ya?
I am not at all niggardly when it comes to payola.
- Payola?
- Ah, it's a technical term. Forget it.
The man who wrote this song is starving in an attic in Brooklyn.
His wife ran out on him, left him penniless with two kids.
She even took the piano with her so now he can't write no more.
If this song ain't a hit, there's only one thing left for this man, the river.
On the other hand, if somebody was to get a great artist like Emily Edwards to introduce it with a band on the radio, this man's fortune would be made and his genius preserved for posterity.
How do you know he ain't another Stephen Foster?
- I don't. Only...
- Just read those words.
Here. Take a couple of copies. I'll hum the tune so you can see how they fit.
Follow me. (TAPPING FOOT)
Right there.
ALL: It's a grand night for singing
The stars are bright above
The earth is aglow and to add to the show
I think I am falling in love
Falling
Falling in love
Maybe it's more than the moon
Maybe it's more than the birds
Maybe it's more than the sight of the night
In a light too lovely for words
Maybe it's more than the earth
Shiny in silvery blue
Maybe the reason
I'm feeling this way
Has something to do with you
It's a grand night for singing
The stars are bright above
The earth is aglow and to add to the show
I think I am falling in love
Falling
Falling in love
La, la, la, la, la, la
- Hey, where's my drink?
- Let's see what else we've got here.
Look, Wayne, how about your singing a chorus?
No, thanks. You're doing all right without me.
- But I want them to hear you.
- You can't be as good as she says.
- You'd be surprised. Come on.
- No, really.
Come on. Don't tell me we have to coax you.
How about singing one of those corn-fed ditties you guys sing around these little towns?
- Come on, Wayne. Sing anything you like.
- Yeah, you can't tell.
You might have something we can use with the band.
As a matter of fact, if you need a new song,
I've got one right here I like very much.
He didn't expect to sing, but he brought his music with him.
- Would you like to try it with me?
- You do it yourself.
- Did you write it?
- No, I didn't. A fellow gave it to me.
- Okay, bud.
- Okay, bud.
This ought to be something.
Maybe you'll never be the love of my life
Maybe I'm not the boy of your dreams
But isn't it kind of fun to look in each other's eyes
Swapping romantic gleams
Maybe you're not a girl to have and to hold
Maybe I'm not a boy who would stay
But isn't it kind of fun carousing around the town
Dancing the night away
Isn't it kind of fun holding hands
According to a sweet and corny custom
Isn't it kind of fun making vows
Admitting that we both intend to bust 'em
Maybe we're out for laughs
A girl and a boy
Kidding across a table for two
But haven't you got a hunch that this is the real McCoy
And all the things we tell each other
Are true
I'm not a girl for sentimental tripe
I never go for the Romeo type
Over a dewy-eyed Juliet
No one has seen me drool yet
I don't say our hearts are tied
By love's eternal tether
But using words less dignified
Isn't it kind of fun to be together
Maybe you'll never be the love of my life
Maybe I'm not the girl of your dreams
But isn't it kind of fun to look in each other's eyes
Swapping romantic gleams
Maybe I'm not a girl to have and to hold
Well, maybe I'm not a boy who would stay
But isn't it kind of fun carousing around the town
Dancing the night away
Oh, isn't it kind of fun holding hands
According to a sweet and corny custom
Isn't it kind of fun making vows
Admitting that we both intend to bust 'em
Maybe we're out for laughs
A girl and a boy
Kidding across a table for two
- But haven't you got a hunch
- That this is the real McCoy
And all the things we tell each other
Are true
- Wonderful.
- That was great.
You know, you're right about that song, Wayne. I like it too.
- You do?
- "Billings Publishing Company," huh?
- A guy named McGee give you this?
- That's right.
How much did he slip you for plugging it tonight?
Wait a minute, Marty!
He didn't slip me anything.
Didn't he promise to come through with the old payola?
- He used that expression.
- I'll bet he did. That's great, Emily.
Your boyfriend cashing in on you.
- MAN: How do you like that?
- EMILY: Wayne!
Wayne.
Wayne, wait a minute.
I'm sorry, Emily.
I just couldn't help it.
He's been putting in digs ever since I got here.
I know he was asking for it, but please don't go.
You don't think I'd cash in on being friends with you like he said, do you?
Of course not. And he wouldn't have said it, only he's had a few drinks.
- Please come back.
- It just wouldn't work, Emily.
I'd let him have it the first time he opened his mouth.
Look. Why don't you walk around the block?
Give me a chance to get rid of them. How about that?
I'd hate to have you break up the party.
I'll tell them I have a headache.
When you come back, we'll be alone.
That's the way you wanted it, isn't it?
- Okay. How long?
- Come back in half an hour.
Emily, I...
- Half an hour.
- Make it 15 minutes.
All right.
Only a few stars left.
Yeah, and they look kind of tired.
Funny how a day creeps on.
So slowly at first you think it's never coming.
Then all of a sudden, it spreads out over the sky, the sun starts shining.
People loom up like that too.
Are you really gonna go home and marry that guy you're engaged to?
That's what girls usually do, isn't it?
Marry the men they're engaged to.
Yeah. They're usually sorry afterward.
Think you'll every marry?
Who, me? Sure. Sometime.
Only trouble is, if I ever found a girl I cared that much about,
I'd care too much about it to wish a guy like me off on her.
- Sounds kind of hopeless.
- I guess it is.
It's pretty hard for me to picture myself, what do they call it, popping the question.
Can you imagine me suddenly turning to some girl and blurting out,
"Will you marry me?"
No. I can see you wouldn't.
Well, bobbylocks, you've made a very wise decision.
Anyway, I'd be no good for you, no good at all.
Of course, you'd be awfully good for me.
Say, what about your old man's hog?
Aren't they gonna judge him this afternoon?
Oh, yes. I guess
I'd better be going.
- Wayne's probably in already.
- it's getting pretty late.
- Don't you want me to go with you?
- No. It's better if you don't.
- Will I see you tonight?
- In front of the roller coaster?
Well, I...
- Good night, honey.
- Good night.
- Pat?
- Yes?
I was only talking. I couldn't marry anybody but you, ever.
Well, Blue Boy, this is the great day, your hour of judgment.
Now take it easy there now.
Don't get your face dirty.
Look, Mother, Blue Boy's already won. There's his blue ribbon.
Oh, that thing?
That's only the class award.
That means he's won his class of senior boars.
I'm getting him ready now to go in for the grand championship.
- Is he all right?
- All right? Why, just look at him.
- (FANFARE)
- He's fit as a fiddle.
MAN: (OVER P.A.)
Class 51, Hampshire senior sows,
- pavilion number two.
- Better go in now, son.
Get seated.
We go in right after this.
- We'd better get going.
- Good luck, Pa.
- Thanks, Ma.
- You too, Blue Boy.
- We'll be pulling for you.
- All right. Bye. See you later.
Well, let's see.
Is your face clean, son?
Yes, you're all right.
You gotta look your best, you know.
You taking her in, Hank?
No, not yet. Just taking her out to put her on the scale.
Blue Boy, what's the matter, son?
- Oh, you think Esmeralda's gone home.
- (FANFARE)
No, she's just gone out to be weighed.
MAN: (OVER P.A.) Hampshire boars, get ready, please.
That's us, son. Come on. Get up.
Oh, don't act this way.
Esmeralda will be back.
She ain't gonna be judged until after you win.
- (MARCHING BAND)
- Come on, boy. Get up.
You hear that? That's the band.
They're playing for you, son.
You can't lay down on me now.
Oh, come on, fella, please.
Attention, please. Attention.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, I have the honor of introducing to you a man whom you all know,
Congressman James A. Goodheart.
During this great day of boar judging, you have seen hundreds of seemingly perfect boars eliminated, leaving only two contestants, the junior champion and the senior champion, both perfect specimens representing excellence of breeding.
The judges realize the importance of their decision, for the boar they decide is the better will be acclaimed grand champion boar of this year's state fair.
Introducing the first contestant,
Whirlwind... number 188.
Winner, junior champion boar.
Owner, Mr. R.C. Martin.
He's awful big, isn't he?
Blue Boy will outpoint him.
And now, for the second contestant, introducing Blue Boy.
- Where's Dad?
- Yes, now what?
Where is he?
Introducing Blue Boy, number 1494.
Winning senior champion boar.
Owner, Mr. Abel Frake.
- Whoa, Blue Boy.
- (SNORTS)
- (SNORTS)
- Whoa, Blue Boy. Whoa, Blue Boy.
- (SNORTS)
- Whoa, Blue Boy.
They didn't look at him very long, did they?
They'll be back.
Blue Boy, get up. Get up on your feet. The judges will see you.
Oh, this is terrible.
He'll lose sure.
- (SNORTING)
- Get up, Blue Boy. Blue Boy!
Come on, son. Get up. Son?
What's the matter with him?
Get him up.
- We can't judge him lying down.
- Come on, Blue Boy! Get up, will ya?
- (SNORTING CONTINUES)
- Blue Boy, come on! Blue Boy, come on.
Come on, son. Get up.
Come on, Blue Boy.
Get up, will you?
Come on, Blue Boy. Come on.
Just a little tired, that's all.
Attention, please. Attention.
I have the honor to announce the winner of this year's grand championship.
Hampshire boar, Blue Boy. it gives me great pleasure.
Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- I'm so happy!
- Oh, Pa!
- Congratulations, Mr. Frake.
My, my. Whoever wrote this must be a friend of the Frake family.
"As Mr. Abel Frake won the grand award,
"he was watched from the grandstand by his charming wife,
"and talented and beautiful daughter Marguerite."
- Come on, Wayne. It's getting late.
- Just a minute.
Say, you look mighty pretty tonight.
Is that a new dress?
- Uh-huh. Do you like it?
- Prettiest girl I ever saw.
Okay, I'm ready.
Not too late now. We wanna get an early start in the morning.
Might be a little late. It's the last night. So long, Dad.
- MARGY: Bye.
- ABEL: So long.
They look nice together, don't they?
Hmm? What'd you say?
I said we had two lovely children.
Who said we didn't?
I wish Margy would make up her mind about Harry.
Why? He won't run away.
He's one of those goody-goody boys.
I don't see anything wrong with that.
You were a good boy when I fell in love with you.
That's what you thought.
Well, since you're such a gay dog, you'd better take me to the midway tonight for a little fun.
- No, Ma, you're all tired out.
- Who said I was tired?
Say. Here's something interesting.
It's about that judge, the fella that gave you the plaque.
It says here how he had a kind of seizure afterwards, delirium tremens sort of.
"While Mr. Hippenstahl was unconscious,
"he kept murmuring something about mincemeat.
"Those nearby declared they could smell brandy on his breath."
You fool.
Now, just for that, you've got to take me out.
Oh, no, Ma.
I've got that nice tired-out feeling.
- You and I are going to the fair.
- I've seen the fair.
- You've seen the hog pavilion.
- (GRUNTS)
Are you going to get out of that chair?
Now, Ma, I'm up.
Now go on in and change your clothes. Go on.
I want some excitement.
I can hear 'em calling hogs in the clear Ioway air
I can sniff the fragrant whiff of an Ioway rose
You've got Ioway in your heart
I've got Ioway in my hair
I've got Ioway in my ears and eyes and nose
Oh, I know all I owe
I owe Ioway
I owe Ioway all I owe and I know why
I am Ioway born and bred
And on Ioway corn I'm fed
Not to mention her barley, wheat and rye
I owe Ioway for her ham
And her beef and her lamb
And her strawberry jam
And her pie
I owe Ioway more than I can ever pay
So I think
I'll move to Calif om-i-ay
- What a shame
- What a shame
- What a shame
- What a shame
You'll be good and gosh darn sorry when you go
- Don't I know
- When you leave your native state
You'll be feeling far from great
You'll be good and gosh darn sorry when you go
I'm a seed
Of Ioway grain
You're a breeze
That Ioway blew
I'm a drop
Of Ioway rain
You're a drip of Ioway dew
Oh, I know all I owe
I owe Ioway
- I owe Ioway all I owe and I know why
- Ioway
I am Ioway born and bred
And on Ioway corn I'm fed
Not to mention her barley, wheat and rye
I owe Ioway for her ham
And her beef and her lamb
And her strawberry jam
And her pie
That's right.
I owe Ioway more than anyone should owe
So I think I'll start in owing Idaho
All together.
- What a shame
- What a shame
- What a shame
- What a shame
- You'll be crying like a baby when you go
- Don't I know
When I leave my native heath
With my lip between my teeth
I'll be bawling like a booby when I go
You're a seed
Of Ioway grain
You're a breeze
That Ioway blew
I'm a drop
Of Ioway rain
You're a drip
Of Ioway dew
ALL: Oh, I know all I owe
- I owe Ioway
- I owe Ioway
- I owe Ioway all I owe and I know why
- I owe Ioway
I am Ioway born and bred and on Ioway corn I'm fed
- Not to mention her barley, wheat and rye
- Barley, wheat and rye
I owe Ioway for her ham
And her beef and her lamb
- And her strawberry jam and her pie
- Pie, pie, pie, pie
- I owe Ioway more than anyone should owe
- Oh
So I think I'll start in owing Idaho
Better stay
Better stay
You'll be good and gosh darn sorry if you go
Don't I know
When you leave your native state
You'll be feeling far from great
You'll be good and gosh darn sorry when you go
I owe Ioway for her ham and her beef and her lamb
And her strawberry jam and her pie
I owe Ioway more than I can ever pay
So I think I'll move to Californ-i-ay
I-O-W! I-O-W! I-O-W! I-O-W-A!
Hooray! Ioway! Yea!
What do you think of this imitation champagne, Ma?
First time I ever tried it, and I love it.
It's as good as that
French champagne any day.
- Did you ever taste French champagne?
- No.
Who's that little runt?
- Hmm?
- What's he grinning at?
That's Mr. Hippenstahl, the pickle and mincemeat judge.
Oh. Oh!
Well, that explains it. He's drunk!
- Quiet, Pa.
- Come on, Ma.
- Let's get out on the midway.
- All right.
Hey, buddy! I wanna thank you for the plug you gave that song last night.
It's all set with Tommy Thomas for Emily to sing it in Chicago tomorrow night.
- Chicago?
- Yeah. That's their next date, the Palmer House.
I'm going with them on the plane tonight.
Sticking close so they won't change their mind.
Emily didn't say she was... I didn't figure on them leaving tonight.
Sure, right after the show.
I wish she'd hurry up and get out here. I wanna talk to her.
Kind of went overboard for each other, didn't you, kid?
- Kind of.
- She told me.
Oh, they all tell me everything.
- You going back to the farm soon?
- Tomorrow.
That'll be good.
Come in.
- Oh, hello.
- I was just on my way out.
- I'll say you are. Where's your suitcase?
- Suitcase? What for?
The old man just phoned from Chicago.
He's gonna give you a crack at that job.
- The Eastern syndicate?
- That's right. A column of your own.
- I can't believe it.
- He's leaving for the coast in the morning and he wants you to fly up to
Chicago and talk to him tonight.
- That means the 8:30 plane.
- How much time have I got?
Practically none. I'm holding a taxi downstairs. I'll get your shaving things.
- Hey, wait!
- What's the matter?
I can't leave now. I've got a girl waiting for me out at the fair.
- What'll I do?
- Do? Get another girl in Chicago.
A girl waiting at the fair.
I break my neck getting this chance for you and you start yapping about some girl.
- This is different. This is not just a girl.
- I know. She's wonderful.
Only girl in the world. And I suppose this job is just a job.
The kind that comes up every day.
Look, I wanna make something very clear to you, sonny-boy.
The old man is funny.
When he wants you someplace, you better, or you're through.
- I know that, but...
- Do you want this job or don't you?
You've got about two minutes to make up your mind.
Thank you very much.
- What did she say?
- She sees a lot of money coming my way.
- Good. I can use some.
- I don't think it'll do you much good.
She says I'm going to marry three times.
MAN: There they are, folks, the eight fugitives from the Follies.
They did a little dance in New York, but the police commissioner objected.
He demanded that they take certain things out of the dance.
Understand? Well, rather than do the emasculated version, they come out here to give you the original dance with nothing cut out.
Just to prove to you what you're gonna see on the inside...
Okay, Mike, let her rip!
- Do you want to go in?
- Huh?
It means nothing to me, but if you'd like to see it,
I'd be glad to take you in, hmm?
Hmm?
What do you think?
Of course, like I say, it means nothing to me unless you wanna go in.
- You do? Come on.
- (CHUCKLES)
Two, please.
- Enjoying yourself?
- Yes, we are.
That's good.
What's that old buzzard doing, following you around?
Don't be foolish, Abel. He's seeing the fair, having fun, same as we are.
MAN: All aboard. Train now leaving.
Get tickets for this ride.
Another train coming in.
Get your tickets for that high, fast ride through the sky, on the big roller coaster the big feature ride of the fair.
WAYNE: But last night and all the things we said, was that just kidding?
- (ORCHESTRA)
- EMILY: No, Wayne, it wasn't just kidding.
Well, it certainly wasn't with me.
I thought that...
Oh, what's the difference what I thought?
But, Wayne, darling, I thought you understood that...
Well, after all, we were just two people who met at a fair...
And fell in love, didn't we?
Well, that was something
I hadn't bargained for.
Wayne, will you believe something?
Just one thing.
It's every bit as hard for me to give you up as it is for...
Well, then why do it?
Why give each other up?
Why don't you come with me, meet my father and mother and go home with us tomorrow?
- Because I can't, Wayne. I...
- Hey, Emily.
- You ready?
- No, she isn't!
I'll be right in, Marty.
Wait here, Wayne.
I have to tell you something, something I should have told you before, and I would have, if I hadn't been such a coward.
Please, wait, Wayne. Please.
You mind if I say something?
- Such as what?
- First, let me get something straight.
When you said that about taking Emily home with you, did you mean the works, a wedding ring and all?
That's it, the works. And that's the way it's gonna be.
Look, I'll give it to you quick.
She's married.
She's got a husband, see?
He don't work at it very hard.
They split up about a year ago.
He claims he's a songwriter, but he's just no good at it.
As a matter of fact, he's just no good, period.
She liked him, though. Sort of knocked her out for a while.
Come to think of it, you're the first guy she's looked at since then.
I guess I just don't understand the people in your business.
Take my word, they're the same as anybody else.
They make mistakes, sure, but don't everybody?
Are all the people in your town perfect?
Why didn't she tell me?
She told you why.
She didn't want to spoil everything.
Maybe she figured she had a right to a little happiness too.
You know what you and me need right now?
A drink.
How about it, buddy?
Ring the old pipe!
There she goes. 47! He's getting higher and higher!
48! Who's next?
Not bad. Not bad at all, Mr. Frake.
Not bad, huh? Thank you.
But you didn't ring the bell, though. Ho, ho, ho.
I know I didn't ring the bell, though. Ho, ho, ho.
- Who can? Can you?
- I don't know. I never tried.
- Why don't you?
- I don't know, but I will.
Step right up, neighbor.
Step right up.
- It's kind of heavy, isn't it?
- Allow me.
- Thank you.
- (CROWD LAUGHING)
Now, I suppose the idea is to lean your weight on it.
- Yes. Put all your 120 pounds in it.
- (CROWD LAUGHING)
Come on, Ma. I'm tired.
Let's go home.
I suppose it's too late to stop someplace for a cup of coffee.
Who said it was too late?
- Easy does it, pal. Easy does it.
- I'm okay.
Sure, you are.
What about this Eleanor, the girl from back home?
You say you graduated from school together, huh?
Yep. She's a fine girl too.
What does she look like, redhead?
- Nope. Blond.
- Oh. I like the redheads.
There's a redhead lives on the floor below me.
What a dish! I keep thinking,
I'll get off the elevator at the wrong floor, but I never do.
Why not? Why don't you?
And have my wife make a cripple out of me for life?
One shoe off, and the other shoe off.
Diddle, diddle, dumpling my son John
Hey, that don't rhyme like it used to.
Did I ever tell you about Eleanor?
She's a girl I went to school with.
- Yes. I know. I know.
- Wonderful!
Just the girl for you.
Wonderful girl.
PAT'S VOICE: Look, bobbylocks, don't worry about me.
Anytime I want to throw in the sponge, you'll know it. I just won't be around.
- You about ready?
- Yes. See you next year.
Yes, indeed. We'll be here.
Take good care of yourself.
We will.
All right, son, get aboard.
- WOMAN: Bye!
- Bye!
(SIGHS) I can't remember when I've been as tired.
It's that resting you did at the fair, Ma.
Three days' rest will tire anybody out.
- Good-bye, Hank!
- Good-bye, Frake! See you next year.
ABEL: You bet.
For goodness sake, what's the matter, Margy?
You're crying like there was never gonna be another fair.
We'll be back next year.
- I never want to see another fair.
- You can say that again.
You meet a lot of people who play you for a sucker and have some laughs at your expense.
When the fair's over, what?
Just chalk it up to experience, I guess.
Sure, that's why you go to a fair, experience.
Something new, different.
Yes, sir, the Frakes are coming home in grand style.
You got your plaque,
I got the grand award, we're all well and happy, and
Dave Miller owes me five bucks.
There you are. That's Melissa's plaque for mincemeat.
And this is mine. First prize for the best boar in the state.
So, you see, Gloomy Gus, you lost your bet.
Nobody got sick and nothing bad happened to any of us.
Only thing is, something might have happened we don't know about.
None of that now.
Come across. $5.00.
- Lemonade, Mr. Miller?
- Yes!
Thank you, Mrs. Frake.
Believe I will.
Would have done your heart good to hear 'em in church this morning.
Everybody talking about the Frakes and all the prizes you won.
- Well, that's nice.
- (CLEARS THROAT)
See you later. I won't be home for dinner.
- All right, son.
- MELISSA: Where are you going?
Oh, just for a little drive.
Did Wayne have a good time?
He looks a little down.
Had the time of his life, far as I can make out.
Mr. Miller. Abel?
No, not now, Ma. (WHISTLING)
Headache better, dear?
How about you, Margy?
Did you have a good time at the fair?
Answer that, Margy.
It's probably Harry for you.
Well, go on, dear.
Don't let it ring all day.
- Well?
- Let's not be hasty about this now.
Hello?
Doesn't anybody ever answer the telephone at your house?
Pat! Oh, Pat!
Here? In Brunswick?
Oh, yes. Yes, I do. I do, Pat!
That's all I wanna know. 'Cause you're going back to Chicago with me.
You're gonna be the wife of a columnist.
Yeah. How do I drive out to your place?
Where are you now? Is your car pointed toward the hotel or the Elk's hall?
Well, get in and keep it going in that direction.
Just keep going until you see me.
Oh, yes, and hurry!
Hurry! Hurry.
- (LAUGHING)
- Margy, you didn't answer my question.
Did you have a good time at the fair?
Oh, yes, Mr. Miller! It was the most wonderful fair in the whole world!
There!
You see? What did I tell you?
Margy! Margy!
That's Mr. Miller's car!
Well!
She'll be right back, I'm sure.
Oh, Pat!
- (HORN HONKS)
- BOTH: Hi!
Hi!
It's a grand night for singing
The stars are bright above
The earth is aglow and to add to the show
I think I am falling in love
Falling
Falling in love
Good evening, Lily. How are you?
Glad to see you.
- Hello, boys. How are you?
- Good evening, Reverend.
- Good evening. Glad to see you.
- How do you do?
- Good evening.
- I see you brought the twins too.
They had to come out.
I hope they stay awake.
- Hello there, Jean.
- How are you?
Come on in, now. Take your hats off, boys.
Take your hats off.
You see, Reverend?
It ain't every Wednesday night a scamp like Little Joe comes back to the fold.
- Petunia dragged him in yet?
- He's coming of his own free will.
Well, I'll believe that when I sees him stand up and confess.
Maybe he's let Petunia down again, Reverend.
You better step over to the house and make sure.
If he done backslid, he wouldn't pay no mind to a deacon.
- You better go yourself.
- Perhaps you're right.
Petunia felt so sure of him this time.
- Now, we don't wanna be late, darling.
- Just a minute, Petunia.
Oh, the Lord won't mind if you ain't wearing a necktie, Little Joe.
- I found the tie.
- Then what you worried about, honey?
Right now
I'm wrestling with the devil.
While I was looking for the necktie in the bureau drawer...
...I also found two calamity cubes.
And I ain't thrown them away yet.
If I been redeemed, why ain't
I pitched them right into the stove?
The fact you told me you found them shows you are trying to be good, Little Joe.
- Evening, Petunia.
- Evening, Reverend.
Bring them along so Reverend Green can burn them up.
- Burn what up, Petunia?
- Oh, Little Joe found some dice...
...and he thinks the devil's got a toehold on him again.
But don't worry, we'll be to the meeting tonight.
Hurry up, Little Joe.
Reverend Green's here.
I'll be there in just a minute, honey.
I don't think any man could be very bad with you to take care of him.
Oh, I reckon he knows I love him.
Yes, he knows I love him better than anything in this world.
And he also knows now, when he gambles, he ain't never gonna win.
How did you convince him of that?
I just showed him he can't win when I ask the Lord to make him lose.
Is that why his luck's always been so bad?
That's the only reason.
He just naturally got a talent for gambling.
Little Joe would've won every two bits in this town if I hadn't told the Lord...
...I didn't want us to make money that way.
You're a wonderful woman, Petunia.
Only last week he bought an Irish Sweepstake ticket.
Got stuck up there in the mirror, worshipping it every day.
"Guaranteed by two dream books and a fortuneteller."
But I've been talking to the Lord about that.
It ain't gonna win either.
What made Little Joe realize the power of your faith?
I'll tell you, Reverend, it's like this.
I've been praying every day for Little Joe to get a job.
This morning he got one.
And that's finally convinced him the Lord's in my corner.
- Good evening, Reverend.
- Evening, Joseph.
I hear you've started to work.
Yes, sir. From now on, you can address me as "mine host."
- I've gone into the hotel business.
- That's fine.
He means he's got a job down at that new hotel downtown.
Yes, sir. I'm operative in charge of elevator number two.
That's gonna be nice for Little Joe.
That hotel's air-conditioned.
You know, honey, when I get rich in the elevator game...
...maybe I'll air-condition our residence.
This one's already air-conditioned with half the roof gone.
Well, it's about time to start the services.
- You'll hurry along, won't you?
- We'll be there.
Reverend, when you call on the sinners to confess...
...you'd better assign me the rest of the evening.
Oh, you're not that bad, Joseph.
Now, those who wish to start out on this pilgrim journey...
...we all will sing and join in singing the song of invitation.
'Tis the old ship of Zion come on, children. Come on, children.
Go ahead, now, Little Joe.
Go on, honey.
- Amen. Praise the Lord.
- Little Joe's joining up, Lily.
That's nice.
Wasn't a minute too soon, neither.
Don't whistle at me through a church window, gentlemen.
- Can't you see I'm busy getting saved?
- Now, wait a minute.
Wait with that "getting saved" business until you pays the money you owe.
- And you owes me more.
- You owe me more than that.
And you'll all be paid.
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Wait a minute.
You can pay us now.
Domino Johnson's back in town.
Domino Johnson?
- You in fast company.
- Yeah, he's over to Jim Henry's café now.
Loaded with money.
- Give him my congratulations.
- He's raring for action.
- He won't play with any of us.
- And he won't play with me.
I got an appointment with repentance.
Wait a minute. This is your chance.
Your last chance to make yourself change before you gets repented.
Domino Johnson don't know you.
No, but you do.
And you know how unlucky I am.
- But this time, you'll play with our money.
- And with our dice.
And Georgia Brown will be over there tonight too.
Look, please let me go.
- Be yourself. You coming along with us.
- I gave up gambling for Petunia's sake.
Didn't you say you wanted Petunia...
...to have those nice things she didn't have before?
- Yes.
- All right, then, here's your chance.
Your last chance to make it the easy way.
Why, man, you can clean up big tonight.
Yeah, but they're waiting for me back in there.
Oh, you can get saved any day.
An opportunity like this only comes once.
Well, maybe I better cut down on my gambling gradual.
- What can I do, Petunia?
- Come on.
Come on, children.
Come on to the Lord. Peace.
Lily.
- Little Joe ain't there.
- Ain't he?
- Well, he was here when the others got up.
- Maybe he's a little shy.
He must be waiting outside.
Come with me, Lily. I'm scared.
Little Joe?
Little Joe?
- He wouldn't go to...
- Well, you know that Little Joe.
No. He wouldn't do that.
He must have gone home.
Come on, Lily.
But, Petunia...
Little Joe? Little Joe?
Little Joe!
He ain't here.
Lily, something awful's happened to Little Joe.
Petunia.
I got in a little trouble again, honey.
Little Joe!
I think he'll pull through.
We'll know in the morning.
- But can I go in, doctor?
- Yes, you may, Petunia.
But don't try to talk to him, because he'll be out of his head.
Lord.
A fool.
Fool.
No, no. No.
Lord...
...please don't take Little Joe from me.
I know how sinful he's been lately, but I love him.
And please forgive me for loving him so much.
But Little Joe ain't wicked.
He's just weak.
And if he dies now, the devil's going to get him sure.
And he don't deserve to be in a mess like that. Little Joe ain't that bad.
So if you'll just let him get well again...
...I promise you he'll mend his ways and give you no more trouble.
Amen.
Those ain't my dice.
He's got a... He's got a gun.
Who's there?
Don't let him in here. I don't know you.
Get him out of here.
Little Joe...
...rise up from that bed and report for duty.
Report? Report where?
Now, where do you suppose you'd be reporting?
A shiftless no-account like you is.
- Get up.
- I can't get up from this bed.
- I'm a very sick man.
- Little Joe, you ain't sick no more.
You are dead.
What are you doing here, Lucius?
What's that you called me?
Ain't you my old friend Lucius Ferry?
Lucius Fe...
You are speaking to Lucifer Jr.
Joe, the asbestos chariot is awaiting.
- Come on, grab him and let's get going.
- No, no!
- Come on.
- I ain't dead. I don't feel dead.
If you ain't...
...who is that laying in that bed?
That's me.
That's right.
Then who do you think you are?
I don't know.
I ain't never been twins before.
And you still ain't twins.
You's the spirit of that body, Little Joe.
And you're the one we've come for.
Petunia.
Petunia, don't let them get me.
Petunia can't hear you now.
Boy, you is gone.
Here I is, Petunia.
Don't look at him. Look at me.
How you expect Petunia to see your spirit?
To her, you just a hunk of thin air.
- Little Joe, your hands is cold.
- Course they is. I'm dead.
Oh, Lord, something's wrong down here. I feel it.
- You ain't gonna let him die, are you?
- That's right, Petunia, pray.
Pray harder. You's a faithful servant.
If Little Joe dies,
I ain't got nothing left to live for.
Don't let up, Petunia.
Keep plugging. Keep plugging for me.
I know you hear me.
If you save him on earth for me...
...I’m gonna save him for you up in heaven.
That is terrific praying.
Come on, grab this rascal.
Let's get him out of here.
- No!
- Get that leg. Take him on out of there.
Get the legs, number four. Pull him around.
Don't let him switch up on you like that!
What's going on here?
I'm in an awful mess.
Reverend?
Who gave you orders to incinerate this man?
We got our orders direct from the hot seat, from the big boss hisself.
And you better keep out of this.
- You're Lucifer's boy, aren't you?
- I am.
Look like old Lucifer been jumping the gun again.
Oh, no, he haven't either. Little Joe here's been 1-A on our list for a long time.
You've had lots of souls that you didn't get.
Yes, I knows that, but Little Joe never did do any repenting until after he was dead.
That don't count and you knows it.
What are you doing down here?
Answer me that.
I'll tell you.
We received a powerful prayer from Petunia here.
It was the most powerful piece of praying...
...we's heard up there in a long time.
- I was afraid of that.
Now, if you coal-heavers don't lay off while we investigate...
...you gonna have some explaining to do.
You don't have to check up on me,
Reverend. You know I been reforming.
I know very little about you, Joseph.
Ain't you the reverend in our church?
I am a soldier of the Lord.
And nothing must be done till I look into this case.
Don't let him bluff you.
We've been wanting to tangle with them birds for a long time.
Now wait a minute here.
What's the reason we can't talk this thing over sensible-like?
Now, what does your boss want with a no-account like Little Joe?
- You knows by rights he belongs to us.
- No, I don't, general.
And I thank you for letting me come with you.
Wait a minute, Joseph. Not so fast.
I was told to investigate, not to bring you up there.
But you won't be taking no chances, sir.
I can be a very handy man up there.
I can run the elevator...
...going up, tune harps and mind cherubs, or anything.
First thing you know, you'll have a bunch of dice-shooting angels on your hands.
Don't listen to him. Listen to Petunia.
- She knows how hard I been...
- Quiet.
I am listening to her.
Lord, if you just let him get well again...
...I promise you I'll get him back in the fold.
- But I promise you...
- Hold on here.
How come Petunia there knows what we're talking about?
I don't know.
Petunia's always been in pretty close touch with the Lord.
But this is a new one on me.
Looks like the Lord is letting her in on something.
That's strictly against the rules for human beings down here.
This is a problem.
Sergeant Fleetfoot.
- Yes, sir.
- Better zoom up...
...and get a firsthand judgment from the Lord.
Yes, sir. I won't be a minute, general.
- No stunting, now.
- Oh, no, sir.
Now, what for you wanna go through all this rigmarole?
You just messing up the bookkeeping.
I tell you what I'll do.
- I'll shoot you for him.
- Okay, you're faded.
Oh, no, Little Joe. Not you, him.
- You're a lot of trouble to us, Little Joe.
- Trouble?
Just wait until your boss starts checking up on his carryings-on with Georgia Brown.
Maybe you didn't know she's my pappy's favorite child.
We know all about that Georgia Brown affair.
- It's a long black mark against you.
- Little Joe just weak.
He was trying to get away from that old Georgia Brown...
...but she just overpowered him.
This coaching from the sideline has gotta stop.
That's dirty pool and you knows it.
Petunia's right, sir.
I was trying to get rid of that woman.
And I was making headway too.
Why, only last week
I says to her... I says:
"Georgia, we can't go on like this.
Why, it's grieving poor Petunia something fierce."
Oh, Little Joe, careful, now.
Well, that's what I thought anyhow.
Don't forget, we can read your thoughts up there too.
Well, that's what I ought to thought.
Little Joe, we's gonna have
Georgia Brown with us before long.
You are, sure enough?
Makes no neverminds to me.
No, sir.
That's right where she belongs.
Little Joe, that thought that weaseled through your soul just now...
...convinces me that you're not fit to associate with our folks up there.
It's just too dangerous.
Oh, my.
I'm just about the most miserablest person what ever died.
Boy, you ain't half as miserable as you gonna be.
Petunia!
Petunia, help!
Little Joe, you ain't breathing.
- Lily, Lily!
- I heard you, Petunia.
Oh, Lord, you ain't gonna let him die.
You ain't forsaken me, have you?
Lily! Little Joe ain't breathing.
- I'm afraid it's all over now, Petunia.
- Don't say that.
The Lord's not taken Little Joe from me so I won't see him again.
You better come get some rest.
If it wasn't for the best, the Lord never would've let this happen to you.
No.
Lord, I've heard your voice.
And I'm hanging on to my faith in you, no matter what happens.
- But don't take Little Joe from me.
- Okay. It's all right.
Don't take him.
You certainly have been a heartache to her, Little Joe.
General, I'm a rat.
Sergeant Fleetfoot, you made good time.
The flying was good, general.
- Tail wind all the way.
- What's the Lord's verdict?
The Lord said Little Joe ain't no fit company for our folks.
Oh, me. The jig's up.
But you ain't heard the whole thing out yet.
- There's a proviso.
- A what?
Quote, "on account of Petunia praying so hard...
...the Lord done give him leave to stay on this earth for six months more.
If he whitewash his soul in that time...
...he makes the grade with heaven."
- And what if he don't?
"Lucifer Sr.
Gets permanent control," unquote.
- You know Little Joe's never gonna change.
- Oh, yes, I can.
I done changed already. Yes, sir.
I'll spread the light and preach the word. Hallelujah.
Wait a minute, Little Joe.
There's one catch in this.
You're not gonna remember anything...
...when you wake up and become alive again.
- I ain't?
- No, you're not.
You see, your human mind is gonna be blank about all this.
Your human mind is over there in your human body.
How am I gonna reform if I don't remember...
...what a mess I was in when I was dead?
- It's gonna be like this, Little Joe.
We're gonna be around telling your conscience the right thing to do.
Of course, you won't see us, but we'll be there.
And is he gonna be around telling my conscience the wrong thing to do?
Oh, I'll be there, all right.
You can depend on that.
That's bad.
Well, I'll be seeing you, Little Joe.
So long.
We'll give him a fight.
Go back, Little Joe, to your human body.
I hope that in this second life...
...you fight a good fight.
I'll be in there pitching, general.
Good luck, Little Joe.
- Petunia! Petunia!
- Great day in the morning.
Here I am, darling.
- Little Joe.
- Petunia.
- You're alive.
- Oh, Lord. This is sure enough a miracle.
- I'll get the doctor.
- We don't need the doctor.
Tell the reverend, tell everybody.
Little Joe's all right.
Lord, I thank you. And right now
I'm so happy, I can't talk.
But I know you understand.
- Petunia.
- Don't move.
Be quiet.
Good morning, Petunia.
You're looking mighty happy this morning.
I was till this minute. What you and Dude coming here for, Jim Henry?
We is devotees of good singing.
But you ain't here because you're music lovers.
We was just wondering how Little Joe's getting along.
Oh, Little Joe just getting along fine.
Doc Jones says he'll be up and about soon.
I'm seeing to it he don't get mixed up with you and your crowd again.
That suits us. But there's a little business matter we'd like to take up with him.
We didn't want to bother Little Joe till he got better...
...but it's been over a month now.
Very thoughtful of you.
I suppose this business matter is money?
Yes. As a matter of fact,
I has the loU right here for...
- Four dollars. And you?
- Six.
Well, Jim Henry...
...you being such a bigtime sport...
...you wouldn't take advantage of somebody like me...
...who don't know nothing about gambling?
- No, no.
- Well, I tell you what.
Suppose we shoot your dice for,
I think the phrase is, "double or nothing"...
...for that money Little Joe owes you.
- That sounds fair enough.
And to show you that we mean you good, we gonna let you roll them.
You mean I can throw them down there on the ground?
- Yeah, sort of out of the way.
- I see.
- Now, look, I can practice a little bit?
- Oh, that's perfectly all right.
- A one and another one.
- That's snake eyes.
- Is that bad?
- It ain't good.
- A two and a one. What's that?
- That's bad news again.
Look here. Ain't there no good news on these things?
Oh, yes, the number's there if you is lucky.
Something tells me I ain't lucky.
Let me see you roll them, Jim Henry.
Anything to pleasure a lady.
You got your money, ain't you?
- Why, of course.
- Well, all you have to do...
...is to lay your money on the ground.
Well, coming at you.
Your announcer is Jim Henry.
Big natural, dice.
- What's the matter?
- I done changed my mind.
- I think I'll roll them myself.
- But you passed the dice to me.
I know, and now I'm passing the dice back to me.
- And these the same dice I had before?
- Oh, yes.
- All right...
- You don't wanna tire yourself out.
Oh, ladies first, Jim Henry.
Never forget your manners.
This time it's for keeps.
Seven.
Ain't that funny how my luck done changed all of a sudden?
I guess I'm just dumb and lucky.
That takes care of you business, little Jim Henry.
Now, put your money down here so I can take charge of you, son.
I... I... I think I'm gonna let mine ride.
You must have thought that
I didn't hear myself speak.
- Read it.
- Eleven.
Correct. Switch dice on me, will you?
That's the stuff you been pulling off on Little Joe. Get out of here, you two.
If I catch you here again,
I'll set the law on you.
Oh, Lord.
Please forgive me for backsliding.
But sometimes when you fight the devil...
...you got to jab him with his own pitchfork.
- You know something, Petunia?
- What?
When I gets recovered...
...I ain't gonna let you break your back working for me.
Oh, I don't mind, sugar, long as it's you I'm working for.
Well, I'm gonna be good to you from now on.
I'm gonna buy you electric washing machine.
You ain't gonna do nobody's scrubbing but your own.
Sure enough? Little Joe, you just about to kill me with kindness.
Oh, Petunia, you know I ain't never done nothing for you before.
Why you've worked your fingers to the bone to see that I had a pleasant recuperation.
You snatched me from the clutches of all those hoodlums I ran with.
I tell you, I feel like a new man.
And that's just the way you gonna continue to be.
How do you know that?
Oh, the Lord gives me proof in here.
How do you mean?
Little Joe, when you're good...
...something in here starts singing.
And the Lord seems to say,
"Petunia...
...all my angels are playing beautiful music...
...because they feel so happy for you.
Can you hear it down there?"
And I listen.
And sure enough I hear it as plain as if I was up in heaven myself...
...and they were teaching me their prettiest tunes.
Then I realize that's the Lord's way of telling me to be happy.
Petunia, how many tunes do you suppose the angels know?
Well, nobody can say that down here.
But if you just keep on being good...
...me and you gonna hear them together someday.
You mean way up there in the deep blue?
- You suppose they'll let us be together?
- Of course they will.
If we do the job right here, they won't let us down...
...when we're finally ready to go home.
Do you reckon the angels know any of the songs you sing?
They sure do.
Oh, I suppose they do sing awful pretty.
But I'd rather hear you any day.
Boogie!
Oh, boogie, boy.
Hey! Stop that noise!
What's going on around here?
Is this what you calls office efficiency?
- You imps is supposed to be working.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Well, boys, we's on the spot.
Pappy said we gotta get Little Joe, or I ain't gonna be the head man around here.
You know that means there's gonna be a shakeup in the Idea Department too.
Why is Lucifer so doggone bent on getting that Little Joe?
Pappy's gotta make a test case out of this one.
He won't let the Lord get away with breaking the rules...
...by giving Little Joe another chance.
If the Lord gets pigheaded about this case...
...I don't know how we gonna win out.
We never has yet.
Boys, we's got to pull something big.
We's got to get a colossal idea.
Like the time we got
King Pharaoh of Egypt...
...to force the children of Israel to make bricks without straw.
- Do y'all remember that one?
- Do I remember that one?
- Wasn't I the one who thunk it up?
- That's right, you was.
- Wasn't the Lord burned up about that one?
- He was that.
I didn't do so bad myself.
I was the one that thought up...
...flies.
- And you ain't had an idea like that since.
You's going stale. All of you.
Ideas like them only come once in a million years, Junior.
One of you better get an idea quick.
Or you all gonna be out there in your old jobs...
...heaving coal in the boiler room.
It's gonna be kind of tough on you boys...
...after this nice, cool, air-conditioned office.
Now, that's gratitude for you.
That's gratitude for you.
After all the wickedness we done promoted for the big boss...
...ever since Eve got Adam to nibble on that apple.
There's a great idea.
Who thought that one up?
Oh, I know you did. Don't tell me.
- Man, that's how I started my career.
- Yeah.
And here we are watching it finish.
If I could just get that psalm-singing Petunia out of the way.
Doggone it, she's in my horns at every turn.
Hey, chief.
How about setting Petunia up in a love nest with a rich racketeer...
...and then getting the joint raided?
- That is the most awful idea!
- I'm sorry.
The whole trouble is, I's stuck with a bunch of B idea men.
All the A boys is over there in Europe.
Say...
...how about?
- No.
- No?
Let me see, now.
I've got it!
I've got something terrifical.
Listen to this. Why can't we flood
Little Joe with money?
Barrels of money.
Make him rich and watch him come down here quicker than that.
- I don't know.
- It's awful good.
Think of all the success we've had with rich souls up there.
Give a man money, watch him act funny.
It ain't bad, Junior.
Now, how you figure you're gonna make Little Joe so rich?
- How about a sweepstake ticket?
- Well, ain't that a little corny?
Oh, no, man.
Ain't Little Joe always buying chances on some kind of ticket that don't pay off?
Yeah. I just remembered, he's got one right now.
Well, all right.
If Lucifer can fix it for that ticket to pay off...
...then we'll call in a girl that we know is gonna help us.
- Miss Georgia Brown.
- The same.
We as good as got Little Joe on the broiler right now.
- Sounds better than the apple gag to me.
- Oh, I guarantees it personally.
Boys, maybe we's in again.
Wait a minute. I'm gonna pull this one on the big boss.
- Get me Lucifer Sr.
- Just a minute.
I just got an idea.
How about taking Little Joe and making him rich?
Boy, where have you been?
Hello.
Hello, Pappy.
I think we just cracked that Little Joe case.
Oh, yes, sir. I just thought up an idea that's a natural.
Came to me just like that.
Can you fix it so Little Joe can cash in big on his sweepstake ticket?
You can?
Then he's just as good as in the bag already.
That's right. We make him rich...
...and with the cooperation of one of your favorite daughters...
Yes, sir. Yes, sir, that's the one.
Then all we does is just sit back and watches the fun.
Okay, then, Pappy.
You just tend to that ticket and leave the rest to me.
Oh, yes, sir. Thank you, Pappy.
How's Mammy?
So you still in the doghouse, huh?
Well, so long, Pappy.
Boys, he's crazy about it.
Now, all we's got to do is to sell Georgia Brown the idea.
She'll know what to do with that Little Joe.
My, my.
You sure are a pretty thing, Georgia.
Yes, sir, you certainly are a sight for the eyes.
Now, just look at yourself.
There's no doubts about it.
You just about the prettiest girl in town.
That's enough. Get going.
Oh, it's such a beautiful day.
Mostly anything could happen to a girl on a pretty day like this.
Wearing her best dress, her best perfume.
Your best perfume.
I wonder what Little Joe's doing right now.
He never could resist you.
And you kind of like him too, don't you?
Yes, sir. That little man certainly had something.
Wouldn't do no harm to sort of...
...mosey over and see how he's doing, huh?
Go on.
Just mosey.
Hey, hey! Hey, be careful.
Where you want this put, Mr. Jackson?
Just take it around to the rear entrance to my residence.
I guess he means the back porch.
- Petunia?
- Right here, honey.
- What you doing?
- Trying to keep your lunch warm.
- You're a little late today.
- I had to stop off at a couple of places.
Joe, you're up to something.
What you hiding behind your back?
A little gift for you.
Oh, Little Joe, you shouldn't.
And ain't they pretty.
Not pretty enough for you, Petunia.
There ain't no flowers pretty enough for my Petunia's birthday.
Birthday. Oh, Joe, this is the first time you've remembered my birthday in years.
Oh, it ain't nothing. I'm aiming to remember all of them from now on.
- What's on the ice?
- Oh, a nice cold pitcher of lemonade.
Oh, yes.
Just what the doctor ordered.
Look at you.
Standing all covered with God's good dirt and all the devilishness sweated out you.
My, but you a handsome sight.
Look at them muscles.
Ain't they killing?
- About to pop out of my sleeve.
- I bet you the strongest man on that job.
Oh, I toss them sacks around like they was full of nothing.
Why, the boss say if I don't slow down he's gonna have to unemploy a couple of men.
Joe, just what on earth are you doing?
Now comes the grand surprise.
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Have some refreshments on the house, boys.
What'll you have for a chaser?
How you like it?
Now all we need is some electricity so we can run it.
Come on.
Oh, honey.
Not on your birthday.
There ain't nobody got no right being happy as I am.
Well, come on. Smile, then.
Come on. That's it.
Now, you wanna do something to make me happy?
Sing us a little song.
- Oh, come on, Miss Jackson.
- Sure.
- The one you sang the first time we...
- Joe.
Oh, you know the one I mean.
Petunia!
Six o'clock already.
How come you so spry, Little Joe?
Oh, you can't wear out a man filled with the spirit of the Lord.
Which one of y'all is Little Joe Jackson?
- What do you want with him?
- Is you him?
Maybe I am. That all depends on who you are.
Well, I got a cablegram for him.
What's a cablegram?
- Something good?
- Well, sometimes it's good...
...and sometimes it's bad.
Well, how about this one?
Is it good or bad?
Well, I wouldn't know about that.
- Well, in that case, I don't want none.
- Oh, so you is Little Joe Jackson.
- You got to receive it.
- What do you mean, I got to receive it?
- This is a free country, ain't it?
- This is special for you.
There's your name right on it.
See there?
Looks like just a ordinary letter to me.
It is, except that it come from under the ocean.
Just sign right there.
Is this gonna cost me something?
We usually gets a little something for our services.
Of course, that's up to you.
Well, that's settled.
What you doing? Voting?
That's my signature when my secretary ain't around.
I'm a very busy man.
Clear out of here, will you?
Maybe I'd better read it to you, huh?
You trying to tell me I can't read?
Now, go on, beat it, while I look over my correspondence.
Okay. I was just trying to be helpful.
What in the world is all this about anyhow?
So that's it.
That's what you've been cooking up in your fire, you smoke-eating mole.
I told Pappy this was gonna take you by surprise.
What do you mean by fixing it for him to win the sweepstake?
- You're not gonna get away with this.
- This'll buy him a ticket to the boiler room.
This is the dirtiest double-cross since Lucifer's been in business.
Why, thank you, general.
You're rather flattering today.
Can't make heads or tails out of this thing.
- Must be an ad, I guess.
- Joseph.
That paper might lead you into temptation.
- Throw it away.
- No, no, don't you do it.
You wouldn't want Petunia to know about it.
Don't believe him.
Petunia would love to know about it.
- Throw it away!
- Hang on to it!
Maybe you'd better step in, Lord.
- Still here, Joe?
- I was just going.
- Going to the picture show?
- No. Me and Petunia's going...
...to a prayer meeting.
- Okay, deacon.
- I'll walk down with you.
- Okay.
Good evening, Junior.
- Does Little Joe Jackson work here?
- You just missed him, lady.
He went home.
Oh, my!
I guess we'll use the frying pan after all.
Petunia!
Honey! Petunia!
Oh, Petunia?
Where are you, Petunia?
Oh, Lily? Where'd Petunia go?
She said she's going to the store to get you some clothes.
Oh, yeah.
Doggone, I ought to fix that roof.
That would be a fine thing to do, Little Joe.
The main idea is to keep busy, you know.
Oh, I'm too tired.
I'll fix it in the morning.
General, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Just take a look over yonder.
Hello, Little Joe.
This is bad business.
Georgia Brown.
Wha..? What are you doing here?
I just wanted to say hello and see how you been.
Ain't no harm in that.
Is there?
Well, there ain't no harm in passing the time of day. I guess.
It's nice to know you're getting well again.
I hope you ain't forgot me.
Oh, I ain't forgot you.
Then maybe you'll be coming round to Jim Henry's place to see me.
- I tell you, Georgia, it's like this.
- Yeah?
It's like this.
It seems the last time I was there,
I got into a little bit of trouble.
Oh, that. Oh, the guy that caused all that trouble...
...that Domino Johnson, he's in jail now.
I know, but that ain't it.
Well, what is it, then?
Look at me, Little Joe.
Is you happy without seeing me?
- Well, the truth is...
- of course you're happy.
Tell her to get away from here before you spoil all your chances.
Tell the truth, I has been trying my best not to think of you lately.
You has, sugar?
Why, you lying rascal. You know you never could get her out of your mind.
Go ahead and tell her that.
Of course, I ain't saying
I altogether forgot you.
You ain't easy to erase from the mind...
...once a man gets to know you good-like.
Why does you want to forget me, sugar?
Well, it seems there was a lot of reasons why...
...but for the life of me, I can't seem to think of one of them now.
Of course, if you don't care about me no more.
Georgia, don't talk like that.
Why, you know I'd never do anything to hurt your feelings.
Oh, honey.
- And there goes his passport to heaven.
- Get her out of here.
Oh, this is the best fight we've won in a long time.
Go ahead, Little Joe.
Kick over the traces.
Now, stop that, Little Joe.
Think of the consequences.
Little Joe, cut that out!
Georgia, this has got to stop.
Little Joe, you ain't fooling me none with that there religion stuff.
I know you better than that.
You're just playing hard to get.
And I know why too.
- What are you talking about?
- This. This is what I'm talking about.
- You dropped it down at the mill.
- Oh, that's just a little old ad.
An ad? Did you read it?
You gonna be filthy with money.
- How filthy?
- Why, you big ignoramus...
...this here piece of paper says you've drawn the horse in the Irish Sweepstake.
- Say that again, slower.
- Listen to this:
"Mr. Joe Jackson.
Dear sir, we are happy to learn...
...that you drew the horse Runaway in the forthcoming Irish Sweepstakes...
...and that he is the favorite to win.
We hereby offer you a sum equal to $50,000 for your interest in..."
I'm gonna be rich!
I don't know whether
I'm dreaming or not.
I'm gonna be rich.
This must be the payoff.
This must be my reward for being a good husband.
Petunia was right. The Lord is wonderful! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
No, no! That's not the way it's supposed to work out.
Wait till Petunia hears this. Hallelujah!
Not quite the way you planned it, eh?
What are you gonna do with all that money, Little Joe?
Buy Petunia all the things she's never had.
Wait till she gets here.
But, Georgia, I wouldn't have known about this if it hadn't been for you.
I'm gonna show you how grateful I am.
I'm gonna buy you a diamond bracelet and a fur coat...
...maybe even your own nightclub too.
- It's all right, Petunia.
- Oh, Little Joe...
...I love you so much more now than I ever did.
This is the most wonderful thing that's ever happened to me.
Little Joe!
Petunia.
You double-crossing snake.
Sneaking that woman in my house the minute my back is turned.
- But, Petunia, you're all wrong. Listen...
- Listen for what?
Ain't I seen and heard enough already?
You gonna buy her a bracelet with the money you earned.
What's the matter? You gone out your mind? You gone crazy?
Yes, I'm going crazy.
And if I stand here looking at you another minute, I'll kill you both!
Listen, let me explain something.
Joe, for the last time, get out of my sight!
Oh, no.
Petunia.
You didn't even give him a chance.
Lord...
...why you let me love him so much...
...so he can hurt me so bad?
Why?
Hey!
Look who's present.
Knock me down if it ain't Domino Johnson.
- When'd you get out?
- Tonight.
- Only had six months' lease on that cell.
- Welcome home.
- Glad to be with you.
- Hey, big boy.
- Hi, y'all, babes.
- Domino!
- Easy, honey, easy.
- Hello, Domino.
- Hello there, Jim Henry.
- Hi, Domino.
- Hi, Dude!
- Nobody I'd rather see than you.
- Come on, have a little drink.
- Thanks. My, my.
Things sure look prosperous.
Last time, one of the characters tried to operate...
...with a pair of imperfect dice, remember?
I don't think Little Joe knew they were loaded.
- Well, he found out.
- What'll it be, Domino?
- A little rye.
- It's on the house. A little rye.
Duke Ellington's band.
Where'd all this prosperity come from?
As a matter of fact, most of the bankroll came from Little Joe.
Yeah, he's just loaded down with money.
He give me this 20 just for shining his shoes.
You better keep him away from me.
- You don't intend to start trouble with him.
- That's up to him.
As a matter of fact,
I'm here entirely for social purposes.
Suppose you tell Miss Georgia Brown that her old friend...
...Domino Johnson is back in circulation.
- I'm not sure she'll be in this evening.
- Still working here, ain't she?
Yeah, when she feels like it.
If she gets in at all, it won't be till late.
Then I'll stick around.
Got a game going upstairs?
- Yeah, a little stud poker.
- Well, I'll stroll up and take a few hands.
But don't forget to let me know when Georgia gets here.
We certainly won't.
If he sees her with Little Joe...
This time I ain't gonna use the door,
I'm going out the window.
- Well, look who's here!
- Domino!
Welcome home, baby.
- You gonna do any shooting tonight?
- Yes, sugar, but only with dice.
- My, you do look sharp tonight.
- Yeah?
Quiet. Which one of you kids is gonna mind my tires tonight?
I am!
Well, I guess I better let you all do it.
Here's a little change for you.
Catch it. Come on.
You better pick us up about 4 in the morning.
Very good, sir, and hot dog.
May I, Madame?
Great day!
Joe, that's the bestest-looking raiment...
...since they first invented clothes.
My, my, look at that jewelry.
It ain't nothing at all.
Wait till you see what
I spring on you next Saturday.
Now, if you'll all just step over to the bar and be my guests.
Georgia, that dress will be ahead of fashion...
...a hundred years from today.
- Yeah, yeah.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
The accessories are even cuter.
Georgia. Georgia.
- Remember, you're a lady now.
- I know it, sugar.
I'm just trying to impress them with that fact.
Hey.
You wanna see something swell?
Lookie there. Genuine silk.
I got a dozen of them.
Dude!
Tell the band to play Georgia's number.
Domino!
Hello, Little Joe.
How you doing these days?
I'm still alive and kicking, but that ain't no fault of yours.
Still cheating the boys with those one-way dice of yours?
Cut that stuff out.
Georgia, what are you doing hanging around with small fry like that?
Better than hanging around with a gambler like you.
- I won't take that from you.
- Look out, he'll go after you again.
That's all right. Let him.
- Only this time, I ain't running, see?
- Come on, boys. Break it up.
This is a social gathering.
You trying to get back in that jail?
Good evening, riffraff.
Hello, Jim Henry.
Thought I'd just drop round...
...and give your joint the once-over.
Why, Petunia.
- Is this really you?
- But not the same me...
...you used to break her back busting suds over a tub for you.
Why, you...
You're beautiful, Petunia.
Save that sugarcoated talk for your girlfriend.
Where'd you get the clothes?
Don't you worry about that.
The main point is you paying for them.
Of course. Of course I'll pay for them.
I didn't realize...
And that ain't all I'm collecting before I'm through.
Don't talk like that, Petunia.
You know I still love you.
Now, you just be a little more careful...
...what you say to your wife in front of me.
Georgia, you keep out of this.
- I'm speaking my mind.
- And I ain't heard a sound.
Little Joe, are you so dumb you can't see what she's after?
We're both after the same thing, but
I'm still the wife and got the inside track.
Petunia, don't talk like that.
Why, I was coming around to see...
Don't strain yourself.
I'm sending my lawyer round to see you...
...and he'd better find you in.
- What for?
- Money. What you think?
And if you ain't saved my half, brother, start sprouting wings.
- What's wings?
- That's one way of getting out of jail.
I know all about that sweepstake money...
...and I'm solid collecting my half, cash on the line.
Well, I don't know if I got that much left, Petunia.
No? Then you're just in the correct suit to be laid out in.
I'll shoot you for a drink, Jim Henry, with your own dice again.
No. Might as well give you the drink and pass up the formalities.
What'll it be, Miss Jackson?
- You may give me a double King Kong.
- Boy. Coming up.
Petunia.
Pardon me, but ain't you the gentleman that used my ex-husband...
...for target practice six months ago?
Yes, I had that pleasure.
Then permit me to buy you a drink for that good deed.
Oh, no, ma'am. The drinks is on me.
You know, Mr. Johnson,
I usually don't drink with strangers...
...but we have so much in common.
We both dislike the same people.
Brown! Ain't it about time for you to get into that cooch dance?
Ladies. Georgia, remember, when you in the presence of a lady...
...you got to act like one.
- I guess she's just jealous...
...because she ain't got what I got.
Quit kidding yourself.
Not only have I got everything you got...
...but a whole lot more.
- Well, you ain't got Little Joe.
And that's the main thing you got I don't want.
And if I run across any more secondhand junk...
...I'll pass that on to you.
- Petunia, you can't act like this.
- Oh, can't I?
Why, Jim Henry, I see you've worked yourself up with an orchestra.
- Yeah.
- Ask the boys to put me in the mood...
...so I can give out.
- With pleasure, Mrs. Jackson.
I suddenly feel a musical urge.
Mrs. Jackson, to your musical urge.
- Give up, general?
- Certainly not.
Well, you might as well.
You haven't forgotten that Little Joe's six-months' trial period is up tonight?
In fact, I think he has just 10 minutes left.
That's a lot of time when we're on the job.
And it looks like he's not coming down there alone.
Why, it looks like he's gonna bring
Petunia right on down there with him.
Little Joe!
Little Joe!
Look out!
- Hey there, what you think you're..?
- Get out.
Lord, do something about this.
Hear my prayer.
Send down your wrath and destroy this wicked place.
No, don't!
Little Joe, don't! He'll shoot you!
No! Little Joe! It's Little Joe!
Little Joe.
Little Joe?
This feels familiar.
Oh, me. I'm in for it again.
Little Joe, you got a funny feeling?
I got a feeling, but it ain't funny.
You know, I don't feel no pain now.
Of course you don't.
You're a ghost now, Petunia.
A ghost? You mean we're both dead?
We got killed in that ruckus.
I'm scared of what'll happen in the next couple of minutes.
How do you know what's gonna happen in the next couple of minutes?
Oh, Lord, I know I ain't got no right asking for forgiveness.
But I was doing all right until I had that falling out with Petunia.
Little Joe, you didn't throw me over for Georgia Brown, did you?
Excuse me just a moment, Lord.
How come you understand all that now?
Oh, I see it plain now.
Georgia Brown come around trying...
...to take you from me, but you resisted her.
Ain't this a fine time to be getting some sense.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry. But then,
I was only human. I didn't understand.
I wonder if the general's gonna see it that way.
General? What on earth you talking about now?
I ain't talking about nothing on earth.
I just hope he gets here before
Lucifer Jr. Comes busting in on us.
- Lucifer Jr.? Who's he?
- I ain't got time to explain that now.
General? You coming, general?
- General!
- Little Joe. Stop that shouting.
Yes, sir, general. Yes, sir.
Petunia, we've just balanced the books on you...
...and find you're eligible to enter the Pearly Gates.
We're discounting this little setback tonight because we know...
...you were just acting up to get Little Joe back.
Oh, thank you, sir. Little Joe coming along with me too, ain't he?
No, I'm afraid not.
Oh, me.
Little Joe, we've just finished your ledger.
- I'm afraid you're in the red again.
- I am?
Yes. Our records show that Georgia Brown...
...got about half the sweepstake money.
The other half was spent at Jim Henry's and other places like that.
You mean, you kept track of how he spent that money?
Yes, it's all down here.
I'm a dead pigeon.
Little Joe, you've heard the final report.
Your account is closed up.
But we've opened...
...a brand-new account for you, you rascal.
Little Joe, come along to Papa.
And what if I refuses to budge off this here spot?
Oh, we likes it when souls needs a little prodding.
- Give me my pitchfork.
- I was only asking, that's all.
- Come on, let's get going.
- No, wait.
- Pappy...
- Junior, sir. Pappy wants to see you.
Georgia Brown has just give herself to the Lord.
Georgia Brown? Why, that's impossible.
Why, she's the best sinner we've got.
She was, but she just repented all of her sins...
...and, boy, there sure was a mess of them.
We can't afford to lose her.
Georgia's first act of atonement was to hand over...
...all of her worldly belongings to the church.
The church?
That's bad.
Pappy's gonna burn about this.
You know, that's just what Pappy said about you.
He also told me to take charge of the Little Joe case.
In fact, you is demoted.
Demoted?
Why, Pappy can't do this to me.
Why, I put the... oh, Pappy!
So long, Junior.
They come and they go.
Yeah, they come and they go.
Georgia Brown atoning?
- Why, this is a great day for us.
- Just a minute, general.
Don't Little Joe get credit in the heavenly ledger for all that money she took from him?
I must. Let's see.
A fur coat and a diamond bracelet...
According to my figures, that just puts me under the wire by a nose.
In fact, I'm 2 cents to the good.
Well, it was a tight squeeze, but I made it.
Little Joe. You ought to know you can't bargain with the Lord.
You're attempting to take advantage of a technicality.
- I am?
- For shame, Little Joe.
Are you trying to rouse the ire of the Lord?
The voice of the Lord.
Yes, Lord.
Yes, Lord. That's about the way things stand, Lord.
Yes, Lord.
Come, Petunia.
The golden chariot's waiting for you.
No.
Oh, Lord, please be patient and listen to me again.
I'm not asking you to take Little Joe to heaven if he don't belong there.
And, Lord, getting to heaven has been the main thought in my life.
But somehow it never crossed my mind
I'd be going there without Little Joe.
And as I am to blame for all this,
I can't leave him.
I just can't leave him, Lord.
- Long climb, ain't it?
- It ain't much farther.
I'm feeling kind of funny.
You think I can make it?
Sure, you can make it.
Yes, you can make it.
I'm getting kind of weary.
- Can I make it?
- Yes, you can make it.
Do you think I can make it?
Petunia.
Can I make it?
Can I make it, Petunia?
Can I make it?
Petunia.
Are you all right, Petunia? Petunia.
- Petunia. Are you all right?
- Of course.
They didn't get you.
Doctor, do something.
- Lay him down.
- Lay down, dear. Quiet.
Do something.
Why, the fever's way down.
He's going to be all right.
All he needs now is plenty of rest.
And he's likely to be hungry pretty soon.
Oh, I'll take care of that.
Don't you worry about him, now, and I'll call in again later on.
And you'd better get some rest yourself.
Oh, I don't need any rest.
I got new strength now.
What's the matter, darling? You in pain?
No, I just remembered something.
Kind of a dream I had, I guess.
Oh, Petunia.
- Oh, Petunia.
- Now, Joe.
Petunia, get me that sweepstake ticket.
And them dice too.
They're on the bureau.
Now burn them.
Burn them up, right away.
All right, darling.
Put these in the stove, Lily.
Joe, what made you think of that right now?
Petunia, you was right.
You was right about me gambling and the bad company I was keeping.
I almost didn't get into heaven on account of it.
Get into heaven?
What are you talking about, Joe?
I had a narrow escape, I'll tell you that.
- And if it hadn't been for you, Petunia...
- oh, well, let's not talk about that now.
Let's talk about how happy you've made me now that you've come back.

Take Me Out to the Ball Game
WOLVES - WORLD'S CHAMPIONS
Hold it, boys. Steady.
- That's it. All right for you, Pete?
- Sure.
Change clothes and get back to work.
- Make it snappy.
- Mike, what have you got for us?
We have the same line up as last year.
Taylor behind the bat, Gordon on third.
Goldberg! Douse that heater!
We have that old double play combination:
O'Brien to Ryan to Goldberg.
Maybe.
You've got Goldberg, but I'm told O'Brien and Ryan ain't showing up this year.
Don't make me laugh.
Tell your readers that they're on their way here this minute.
They've been working out all winter and they're in the pink.
Okay. Thanks, fellas.
Did you hear from them?
I've sent them 10 telegrams, and they ain't answered one.
Here's one they'll answer. Where are they?
They're in Pottstown, Illinois.
Pottstown, Illinois?
Get a pencil and paper. Write this down.
"O'Brien and Ryan, Pottstown, Illinois.
"Who do you guys think you are?" Stop.
"Get your fannies on the first train to Florida or I'll throw you out of baseball!"
Wait a minute, make a change there.
Just say...
..."Please, fellas, we need you."

"Nelly Kelly loved baseball games
"Knew the players, knew all their names
"You could see her there every day
Shout 'Hurray! '
"When they'd play
"Her boyfriend by the name of Joe
"Said, 'To Coney Isle, dear, we'll go'
"Then Nelly started to fret and pout
"And to him I heard her shout
"'Take me out to the ball game
"'Take me out with the crowd
"'Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack
"'I don't care if I never get back
"'Let me root, root, root for the home team
"'lf they don't win it's a shame
"'Cause it's one, two, three strikes you're out
"'At the old ball game!"'
- You wanna chase them all home?
- Yeah, we wanna.
Why don't you stop stealing bows?
Why don't you mind your own business?
- You bonehead. I got a notion to...
- To what?
Denny, cut it out, will you?
You big lug!
Now wait a minute, Eddie.
Wake up, kid. We're in a hurry.
- What happened?
- Nothing.
This happens all the time.
Every once in a while he gets illusions.
He thinks he has muscles.
Are you pulling out?
Yeah. We've got to catch a train.
We're joining the ball club in Florida.
Goodbye, baby doll.
- See you next season
- 'Bye.
Lucky punch, that's what it was.
How many times have I told you to pick on somebody your size?
There ain't nobody my size!
I could have knocked the big lug for a loop.
- But I didn't want to hurt my hands.
- Sure.
You don't want me to show up at training with a busted hand, do you?
You save these pictures, don't you?
For the kids at the park, yeah.
That's me.
I'd sooner have my picture in front of a theatre.
You and your show business.
It's gonna be great to get back in that old ball game again.
I can hear the umps now.
"Batteries for today...
"...Rube Waddell and R. C. Schrick."
- Kind of chokes you up, doesn't it?
- Yeah, it chokes me.
When I think of all the dames I lost because I had to be in bed by 10:00.
Play a lot of checkers by 10:00.
No, sir, brother.
Give me vaudeville anytime.
And maybe a musical show. 50 girls.
Maybe even 100 girls. Oh, boy!
I suppose it would be more fun than playing checkers.
You suppose?
You know, Denny...
...you're getting old enough to find out.
To tell you the truth, Ed...
...lately, I have been thinking a lot about romance and about girls.
No!
Yeah.
- They smiled at us. Let's go talk to them.
- We don't even know them.
But I feel like talking.
I'm a very sociable fellow.
Let's go talk to those fellows over there.
It ain't the same.
SARASOTA BASEBALL PARK
- Drop our stuff at the hotel, will you?
- Yes, Mr. O'Brien.
Look who's here! How are you?
How you doing, kids?
Win a pennant again this season?
- How's the throwing arm?
- You got any pictures?
- There's the guy with pictures.
- Got thousands of them. There you are.
What a sight.
You got to admit, it's a great thrill.
Who's knocking it?
Kind of warm feeling comes over you, doesn't it?
It happens to me every spring.
PLAYERS ENTRANCE
Ryan! How are you?
- Good to see you. O'Brien!
- How you doing, Slappy?
Goldberg!
Eddie! Dennis! How are you?
How you been?
What about your vaudeville tour?
It was great.
We worked every town in the USA.
But we didn't work hard.
We had time for play.
The art shows, the birdwalks, the museums were nice.
Tell them about the girls!
The quail! The mice!
The mice!
Yeah, the girls.
"I kissed a gal in old Wyoming
"She rode a horse in a Wild West show
"When I said, 'Baby, I'm bent on roaming'
"She cried, 'We just got started' and she sighed, 'We can't be parted'
"But I left her broken-hearted at the rodeo
"Oh, yes, indeed
"Yes, indeedy
"Yes, indeed
"The boy said, 'No'
"Yes, indeed
"Yes, indeedy
"I left her broken-hearted at the rodeo
"I kissed a gal way out in Boise
"That's Idaho where potatoes grow
"I went away and her sobs were noisy
"I said, 'I'll see you later' and I hopped the nearest freighter
"Left her holding a potato down in Idaho
"Yes, indeed
"Yes, indeedy
"Yes, indeed
The boy said, 'No'
"Yes, indeed
"Yes, indeedy
"She's left with her potatoes down in Idaho
"I kissed a gal in old Poughkeepsie
"That's where the College of Vassar's found
"She couldn't study, love made her tipsy
"Her teachers wouldn't pass her so she just turned on the gas
"And now the sweetest gal at Vassar's in the cold, cold ground
"Yes, indeed
"Yes, indeedy
"Yes, indeed
The boy's a hound
"The sweetest gal at Vassar's in the cold, cold ground
"I met a gal when we hit Manhattan
"A scrumptious babe dressed in silk and lace
"Her eyes were stars and her skin were satin
"I told her how I'd missed her then she murmured that and this
"So I thought I'd try to kiss her, but she slapped my face!
"Yes, indeed
"Yes, indeedy
"Yes, indeed
Couldn't reach first base
"Yes, indeed
"Yes, indeedy
"I thought I'd try to kiss her, but she slapped my face!
"I kissed a gal down in Mississippi
"A Southern belle name of Emmy Joe"
That was her name?
"I thought for once love had got me dippy
"She called me 'Lucky Seven'
"Said my kisses were from heaven
"Then I learned she was 11
And I had to go
"Yes, indeedy
"Yes, indeedy
"Yes, indeedy
"Her age was just 11
So he had to go
"Yes, indeed
"Yes, indeedy
"Yes, indeed
The boys made hay
"Yes, indeed
"Yes, indeedy
"We're hot as electric wires
Twice as hot as forest fires
"And the biggest pair of liars!"
Liars?
What the hay?
"We're the biggest pair of liars in the USA"
Gilhuly!
- How are you?
- Hiya, Mike. How are you?
What's ailing him?
I've got some bad news for you.
This just came.
"From the law office of Hergesheimer,
Hergesheimer, Hergesheimer, Herge..."
Never mind the batting order.
"Gentlemen...
"...this will inform you that according to the will of Colonel J. B. Newhouse...
"...former owner of the baseball club known as the Wolves...
"...all rights and interests in said club...
"...have been bequeathed to the late
Colonel's young and distant relative...
"...one K. C. Higgins...
"...who will arrive in Florida on the 10th instant to assert ownership...
"...and actively participate in the management of said club."
- Who's K. C. Higgins?
- He'll probably want to pitch.
We got to take orders from a dopey kid who never swung a bat?
- Looks that way.
- Not to me!
I don't know about you, but I want us to win the pennant.
You don't cop any prize money finishing in last place.
This happened to Baltimore once.
They had to dig them out of the cellar.
- Lf this guy opens his trap, I quit!
- So do I!
Wait a minute. Quiet.
Wait a minute now.
How about a little fair play here, boys?
You guys don't even know this Higgins.
Now here's what I say.
He's gonna arrive here Sunday morning.
Until then, let's keep an open mind.
Above all, let's not judge him too hastily.
The little rat!
You take the back end.
Are you Mr. Higgins?
K. C. Higgins?
- Higgins?
- No.
Good.
- Are either of you Higgins?
- No.
- I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.
I never did have any sense of direction,
Miss...
- K. C., Miss Higgins.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
Florida Palms Hotel, please.
K. C. Higgins!
He's a girl!
Miss?
Are you looking for someone?
Yes, I am. Michael Gilhuly, he's the manager of the Wolves.
Could you point him out to me?
Lt'd be an awful long point.
He's down at the railroad station.
He went to meet the 12:10.
That's the train I came in on.
I must have missed him.
I wonder how he missed you.
Mike ought to be along very soon.
Where are your manners?
Give the lady your seat.
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
- Won't you sit down?
One of our very nicest chairs.
Go read your funny papers, kid.
Mike's in a nasty temper this morning.
Boy, is he mad!
What seems to be the trouble?
He's gone to get the new owner of the club.
Is that bad?
Bad?
On the trip down, you didn't run into a little fathead named Higgins, did you?
A little fathead?
Some, lamebrain from Providence,
Rhode Island.
Excuse me, but I'd better...
You better wait until Mike cools off.
Now, look, baby doll...
Just put yourself in my hands.
Fast worker, that boy.
Just met her, and he's rounding third.
It's a sad situation, miss. Picture this.
Here we are, the greatest team in baseball, the champs...
...and this little fathead from Providence will come here and teach us the game.
- How do you like that?
- It's very depressing.
Don't ever be a ball player.
I'll try and avoid it.
Let's talk about you.
What are you doing tonight after dinner?
I hadn't made any...
- After dinner?
- Yeah, how about stepping out a little?
Just the two of us?
Aren't you ball players supposed to be in training?
Who, me?
- I don't believe in it.
- You don't say!
What time do you usually get in?
We're supposed to be in by 10:00.
It's all right for the others, but I usually get in about midnight.
Except, of course, when I have an extra special date.
Then I get in about 2:00 or 3:00.
Tonight I could stay up until 5:00.
Really?
Won't Mr. Gilhuly get mad?
What I always say is, what the boss doesn't know won't hurt me.
You get it, sister?
I get it, brother.
Here he is.
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine,
Miss...
Higgins. K. C. Higgins.
- I'm afraid I missed you at the station.
- I'm sorry.
That's all right.
We've had a very interesting chat...
...Mr. O'Brien and I.
Haven't we?
We sure have, Miss Higgins.
Just call me "Fathead."
Take it easy, now, Eddie.
Papa!
What's bothering you, Ed?
You swing like a rusty gate.
- He's lost his batting eye.
- Yeah.
Mr. O'Brien, you're stepping in the bucket.
How's that?
I said, "You're stepping in the bucket."
Thank you.
Maybe you'd like show me how to do it.
If you don't mind.
I'd like to.
Slappy, would you get me the water bucket, please?
May I?
You see, here's what's happening.
Instead of stepping into the ball, like this...
...you're stepping over here...
...and into the bucket.
Let me get this straight.
When I stand at the plate, I'm like this.
No, I hold it a little higher. Up here.
You see?
And while waiting for the pitch,
I wiggle a little bit.
Like this.
Just to get myself set.
Yes, I've noticed that.
Now, as the ball comes over...
...try stepping into it as you bring the bat back like...
I'm so sorry, Mr. O'Brien.
Would you try it, please?
Pitch to him, would you, Joe?
But easy on that arm.
Yeah, easy on the arm.
Okay.
What a poke!
That's four bases in any ball park!
That's the idea, Eddie, but don't try to kill them all.
You know Charlie Davis of Cincinnati only hit 279 but he batted in 102 runs.
Why don't you get Charlie Davis?
Cut the cracks, Eddie!
Mr. Gilhuly, I seem to have taken over your job.
Not at all, Miss Higgins.
Please forgive me.
I'll see you back at the hotel.
Let's get busy! Get around there.
Come on, Dennis.
Look out!
Ain't that something?
She's the kind of girl
I've always dreamed about.
Wouldn't it be wonderful to be married to a girl who played baseball?
I remember this time last season, we were playing Scranton.
Great town!
Anyway there's a dame named Maxine that's kind of sweet on me.
A very refined, artistic little chick with plenty on the ball.
- A kootch dancer from the circus.
- That's what I mean.
Goldberg, give me the bread.
Anyway, this minx is really warm for me.
One night, she's walking me home after the show...
...when all of a sudden
I hear a flute playing a kootch dance.
You know like this.
- Good evening, boys.
- Good evening.
- Evening, Miss Higgins.
- Hello, Denny.
Sit down.
What do you think it is, a formal affair?
Is she gonna eat with us, too?
Hey, watch your language, fellows, and your table manners, too.
She called me Denny.
This may not be such a good idea.
You're kind of cramping their style.
They're not used to eating with skirts.
I mean, ladies.
The sooner they get used to seeing me around, the better it will be for all of us.
Yes, ma'am.
Would someone be so kind as to pass me the bread, please?
- Yes, indeed.
- With pleasure.
Thank you very much.
Mind your manners!
What's the matter?
I had my pinky out, didn't I?
Temper, Mr. Zalinka. Temper.
Have you boys seen the fashion page in this week's Vanity Fair?
There's the cutest pair of pants with a peg top and a narrow bottom...
...if you'll pardon the expression, and the sweetest pair of...
Look. We're plastered all over the paper.
Pretty nice.
O'Brien To Ryan To Goldberg
What does it say?
- Shall we tell them?
- Shall we?
By all means.
"O'Brien
- "To Ryan
- "To Goldberg
"What a great double play!
"The other team never can get to score
- "In every inning

- How about a game of checkers?
- Checkers? That's for firemen.
For ballplayers too, if you know what's good for you.
I know what's good for me.
Don't lock the door. I'll be in around 2:00.
What's the fine for breaking training?
$25. Why?
Let's make it $50, shall we?
The little dears do need their rest, you know.
How much money have you got?
Well, in round figures, exactly 38 cents.
And you?
Checkers.
I didn't say nothing.
- That's a quarter you owe me.
- This could go on all season.
- What's eating him, anyway?
- The call of the wild, junior.
Something's got to be done.
Something's got to be done.
Take a look.
Beautiful, isn't she?
Not bad for a dame who can field a hot grounder.
"'... The crowd
"'Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack
"'I don't care if I never get back
"'Let me root, root, root for the home team
"'lf they don't win it's a shame
"'Cause it's one, two, three strikes you're out
"'At the old ball game
"'One, two, three strikes
You're out
"'At the old ball game"'
Boys, I've got it.
This is what we do. First, we...
Fellas...
...come here.
Come here!
There's one way we can break training without getting into a jam.
Take her out on a date. We'll get two other girls and we'll go stepping.
I've got a hunch that girl is human.
Yes, and guess who she's crazy about?
You.
Me? Personally? You think so?
Sure. Denny, this is it.
If she's a dame, she wants romance.
And she's a dame.
Denny, here's your chance.
A touch of her hand, a subtle caress...
...a few tender little nothings whispered in the moonlight...
Denny, it's up to you.
But I don't know any tender little nothings.
It's been my experience, the athletic type like Higgins...
...might go for the caveman approach, like this.
Come here.
Handle her rough, Denny.
Rough?
No.
What do you want me to do?
First, go out on that balcony.
Let her see you.
Then let nature take its course.
Be nonchalant.
But I don't know about nonchalant and things like that.
Sit on the rail, look up at the moon.
Look up at the moon!
Never mind the moon.
Never mind the moon!
Make up your mind.
Attract her attention.
Cough!
Softly, you dope.
Hello, Denny.
Hello, Miss Higgins.
Katherine's the name.
Hello, Katherine.
What do I do next?
What did you say, Denny?
I said, what do I do...
- Talk to her!
- Say something!
- Go down and talk to her.
- How can I get down?
- Get down the tree!
- The tree?
Go down the tree. Go on. Don't stop now!
- Hello, Miss Higgins.
- Katherine.
Katherine.
- It's a lovely night, ain't it?
- Yes, it is, Denny.
And that's a great big moon, ain't it?
Yes, it certainly is. It's a lovely moon.
How's that?
I said, "It's a lovely moon."
Just stopped to think that...
...a lovely night like this and a great big moon, and a girl like...
The right girl, Denny.
Sure.
How would you be able to tell, Denny?
I could tell.
Right away?
Right from the very first time.
"I'll hear heavenly music
"I'll hear bells start to chime
"I'll hear thunder
"And I'll be struck with wonder
"But I won't have to look
"A second time
"If her voice is a song
"And her walk is a dance
"And if her laugh
"Is warm and free
"If I suddenly seem
"To be seeing a dream
"She's the right girl for me
"If the glow in her eyes
"And the light in her smile
"Could charm a bird
"Right off a tree
"I'll be charmed as a bird
"And I'll know in a word
"She's the right girl for me
"She'll have a simple, sweet appeal
"That wins my affection
"She'll be the kind who'll make me feel
"She needs my protection
"If the sight of her face
"And the touch of her hand
"Can make me happy as can be
"If my heart says, 'Come in
"'Darling, where have you been? '
"She's the right girl...
"...for me"
That was beautiful, Denny. Beautiful!
Miss Higgins, you're wonderful!
The way you picked up that grounder was just wonderful.
The kid's all right.
Yes. It's gonna be a gay social season.
There's some little red books in my drawer.
Get me Volume 3.
Volume 3.
One, three.
Give me that.
We'll get two other girls.
We'll be a party of six till we get to town.
Then it's every man for himself.
Let's see now: Alice, Stella.
How about Stella?
- Nothing.
- Nothing? Let me see.
Jesse Davis,
I think she owned a horse and buggy.
I don't think we'll go out tonight.
What do you mean?
There's the bag.
Hit it hard.
- You're out.
- Got me.
See if you can get it.
I'll go to second. I got it.
Out.
- Wonderful.
- That's fun, Denny, but...
...it is getting late.
I think I'd better be going.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Of all the stupid...
He's probably coming back for his baseball bat.
What a spot for a pinch hitter.
Pinch hitter? No, not me.
I'm poison to her.
We've got to get out of here.
The social season. The little red book.
Remember?
- That a boy!
- Okay.
She's wonderful! She's beautiful!
Did you see her figure?
Did we see her figure?
Wait a minute. What are you gonna do?
Take it up where you left off.
A fine pal he turned out to be!
Come on. Quit worrying!
He's just gonna fix it up for you.
He is? Really?
"If I suddenly seem
"To be seeing a dream
"She's the right girl for me"
Who is it?
It's me. O'Brien.
May I come up?
I hope you'll pardon me,
Miss Higgins, but I...
There's something on my mind and I...
Yes?
I'd like to apologize...
...for everything that's happened.
I've been behaving like an idiot, haven't I?
Yes, you have.
I just wanted you to know I was sorry.
Fine. Was there anything else?
- What?
- 'Cause it's getting kind of late.
Miss Higgins, don't go in yet.
Why not?
- Don't spoil it!
- Spoil what?
The whole picture.
The moonlight on the ocean...
...and the garden and the night...
...and you on a balcony.
Mr. O'Brien, you're very poetic for a shortstop.
Call me Edward.
Edward.
By the way, what'll I call you?
Miss K. C. Higgins?
No.
What does the "K" stand for?
Katherine.
That's nice.
What does the "C" stand for?
Catherine.
Two Katherines.
They couldn't decide which way to spell it, so they named you twice.
That's right.
- You sure they're talking about me?
- Positive. They're laughing, aren't they?
Look, Katherine, Catherine, we're wasting time.
Why don't we go for a stroll on the beach in the moonlight?
- But don't you think it's a little late?
- No.
Well, I do.
How about tomorrow night?
Perhaps. But you'd better go now.
Okay.
The stairs, please.
Goodnight.
Goodnight and sweet dreams, baby doll.
Kissing her hand!
The dirty double-crossing rat!
Calm down, will you?
He's just kissing her for you.
Then what? I suppose she'll kiss him and he'll come back and kiss me?
I know I won't like it!
Edward.
Yes?
You broke training tonight just to speak to me.
You risked a fine.
I'd risk my life.
You would?
Then I'm sure you won't mind.
Mind what?
It's going to cost you $50...
...baby doll.
Goodnight.
- He's only trying to help you.
- Looks like he's helping himself!
Wise guy, ain't you?
Trying to beat my time?
Forget it, will you?
You climbed the wrong balcony this time, buddy.
- Go away.
- Put up your dukes!
He walked right into it!
Hey, what's all this noise about?
You guys should be in bed!
- What's the matter with him?
- Nothing.
They were showing me their new vaudeville act.
Yeah, the new vaudeville act.
"Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou, Romeo?
"Deny thy father and refuse thy name.
"If thou wilt not be, but sworn my love
"And I'll no longer be a Capu..."
Go to bed, Goldberg! And you, too, Juliet!
WOLVES START HEAVY
PRE-SEASON TRAINING
WOLVES HEAD FOR HOME
WILL MEET SENATORS IN OPENER
TEDDY ROOSEVELT TO ATTEND OPENER
All right, boys, that's it. Come on.
What's going on out there, Mike?
The boys like to do a little clowning.
They do it before every game.
The fans eat it up.
It looks like the Senators to me, at the right odds.
- Three to two?
- I'll take $2,000 worth.
You've got it.
- Who's that skinny little runt?
- Denny Ryan, the second baseman.
He's cute.
And so active for a little fellow.
Denny!
Hiya. Pleased to meet you.
My name's Shirley.
Didn't you like it?
I don't like to mix clowning with baseball.
Maybe I ought to give up baseball and stick to clowning.
Mr. President, would you mind posing with this "big stick"?
Delighted.
Get a nice one in there now.
- Come on back. Come on back.
- Safe!
All right.
Send him around now, boys.
Strike!
- Would you like my opinion?
- Play ball.
Strike!
What's the matter? You blind?
Keep your eyes open!
Watch them, you robber!
Cut it out, O'Brien!
- Cut what out?
- Riding the umpire.
Miss Higgins says you're antagonizing him.
So what? He's an umpire, ain't he?
I guess she's afraid we'll hurt his feelings.
Safe! That's the old boy.
- He looks like the winning run.
- He's a long way from home.
- Strike!
- What? Why?
Lay off the umpire!
So sorry. I almost lost my temper, sir.
You'll pardon the suggestion, sir, but I have a cousin in the optical trade.
He can get you the finest pair of spectacles wholesale, bifocals, too.
Play ball!
Give that big mouth of yours a rest!
I beg your pardon, but I was not addressing you, stupid.
Ball!
Thank you, sir. Even you could see that.
You're out!
- I was safe for a mile!
- And I say you're out!
I say you're a liar!
He never even tagged me.
Of all decisions, that's the worst
I've ever seen! You blind robber!
- You going to take that?
- You don't belong here.
Umpires always know best!
You've been calling them wrong all day, you big burglar, you!
That's a very libelous remark.
I won't listen to that! Get off the field!
- You can't put me off!
- Yes, you can, can't you?
- Get off. And you are fined $50.
- I'm not going to pay it, you crook!
- You thief! You robber!
- Don't start anything.
- You burglar!
- Make it $100!
- And you keep out of this!
- Me? What did I say?
Play ball!
Certainly, sir.
Ball!
- What!
- Shut up, or I'll put you off the field, too!
That was right over the plate.
I couldn't even reach that with the big stick.
You could use it to match that big head of yours!
What'd you say?
You heard me. Your ears don't lap over.
Your nose don't either, but I could arrange it.
Play ball!
Ryan, come back!
Wait. What do you want, to start something, Buddy?
Sure.
Cut it out! Break it up! Play ball!
He's hurt. They'll trample him.
You're out!
Give him air.
There's $3,000.
- Better luck next time.
- The season's just started.
Look who's here.
Easy now. There.
- The poor kid. He's out cold.
- I'll make him come around.
I didn't know you was stuck on the guy.
Who's stuck on him? I ain't stuck on him.
It's just the mother instinct.
That's what it is, the mother instinct.
Hey, you. Come here.
He's a nice-looking little fellow.
Bring him over to the café sometime if he ever wakes up.
He's waking up now.
Mr. Ryan.
What happened? Are you all right?
Who are you, anyway?
- She owns him.
- What?
She owns me, too.
Can you do that?
What happened to me?
Who are you?
She wants to be your mother.
She wants to be my...
I'll have to take it up with my father.

I want to talk to you.
No, I'm sorry. I'm very busy now.
Why don't she leave me alone?
I got to see you, just for a minute.
I can't now. I'm busy.
Denny, why don't you talk to the lady?
She ain't a lady.
She's been sending me candy and flowers, she's been writing and phoning me.
What does she want from me?
You can't drive a horse up on the sidewalk!
Are you crazy?
Come here!
Why are you running away?
What's wrong with you?
She just wants to mother you.
With a whip in her hand? Are you crazy?
You bad boy, I got a notion to take you on my knee.
- You mean over your knee, don't you?
- I know what I mean!
What do you want with me?
I got an invitation for you, the whole team.
You, too, I guess.
An invitation to what?
Joe Lorgan's throwing a party
Saturday night after the game...
...down at Gibby's Wharf, and he wants the whole team to come.
I don't know...
Are you afraid the boys might enjoy themselves?
You'll love it, there'll be beer and food and music and dancing...
...and clams!

We're entertaining a bunch of ball players.
I don't get it
These boys are a cinch to win. You bet a big chunk of dough against them.
I like the odds. They're 4-to-1.
But they're unbeatable.
So was One Round Delgan until he was knocked cold.
- That fight was fixed. You yourself...
- You don't say!
You sure need fattening up.
I don't need anything.
Bones.
She don't feed you enough, that one.
- What one?
- The one that owns you.
She doesn't own me, and she feeds me plenty.
Then she ought to change your formula.
Is she your girl?
Yes. No. I mean, I don't know.
If I was your girl, you'd know.
Some people just never appreciate.
Appreciate what?
Just appreciate.
You know, come to think of it, she's really not your type of girl at all.
Will you do me a favor, and don't think about it?
She's wonderful.
Sometimes a person thinks a person is his type of person.
Suddenly, he meets another person who turns out to be really his type of person.
Do you know what I mean?
No. And I don't believe you.
Besides, when the right one comes along,
I'll know.
I'll wait.
Say, what's with you and Denny, or am I too personal?
Yes, you are. Much too.
I have a reason for wanting to know.
A personal reason.
You've been keeping me awake nights.
I have?
You have. Indirectly, of course.
Denny talks about you in his sleep.
Keeps waking me up.
Last night, for instance.
All of a sudden he woke up yelling...
..."slide, Katherine, slide."
Denny even dreams baseball.
He wasn't dreaming about baseball.
How do you know?
Because when I leaned over to wake him up, he embraced me...
...like this...
...and then he kissed me, like this.
You're right.
It couldn't have been about baseball.
That's what I said.
Okay, Eddie, okay.
Boy, I got to hand it to you. You win.
Win what, Nat?
Nothing, Miss Higgins.
Come on, Nat. What is it, tell me?
Something personal between us.
I bet him $1 that I'd kiss you before the dance was over.
You know something, Eddie?
Sometimes I don't get you.
Sometimes I don't get myself.
- Why'd you tell her?
- I didn't intend to.
Then why did you?
Because she's got Denny crazy about her and she doesn't care that much about him.
How do you know?
From the way she kissed me.
You're kind of mixed up, ain't you, fellow?
Kind of.
- At last.
- At last what, Denny?
You know, Katherine. You must know.
No, Denny, please.
Honest, from the minute you picked up that grounder and threw to third...
...I knew it was love.
- No.
It, it's just that I don't want you to build up any false hopes.
I like you very much but, well...
You mean, maybe when the season's over?
After we win the pennant?
- We'll talk about it then.
- Good.
Will you do me a favor?
Sure.
Will you kiss me? Right now. Hard.
Kiss you now?
- Here? Now?
- Right here.
No kick in it?
No. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Sure, it's all right. I understand.
Sometimes a person thinks a person is her type of person...
...and all of a sudden, she finds that...
...that person's really not her type, but another one is her type of person.
It doesn't always work that way, Denny.
It doesn't always work?
- What are you doing spying on me?
- Who's spying? I was just watching.
Some people just never appreciate.
Come here, you.
Well, come here.
Kiss me.
Did it have any kick in it?
Good.
I was beginning to worry a little bit.
Hello, Shirley.
Hi.
Dennis, you shouldn't have kissed me in front of all these people.
What's wrong with Mrs. O'Brien's boy, Eddie?
Heart trouble.
It looks like heart trouble to me.
What Irish lad could sit while the fiddlers are fiddling...
...the pipes are piping, the women are smiling like it's a wedding.
You should be leaping in the air, knocking your heels, doing a handsome clog.
Come on, get with us!
Go to it, Michael, my boy.
The Gilhulys were the greatest dancers in all Ireland.
This is what sent me over Cockney the night of the Big Wind.
Now you can see why the O'Briens were the first kings of Ireland.
- Good little hoofer, that O'Brien.
- Not a bad shortstop, either.
That infield wouldn't be much good without him.
- Where did you get that hat?
- Where did you get that hat?
Where did you get that hat?
"'Where did you get that hat? '
Folks ask me every day
"'lsn't it a nifty one? '
You often hear them say
"Put it on, it's funny
Can't you see the people smile
"It keeps me busy telling them
"The history of this tile
"It's the hat my dear old father wore
"Upon St. Patrick's Day
"Now talk about respect

What a wonderful clambake!
The most wonderful clambake there ever was!
Yeah, wonderful.
What's eating you?
As if I didn't know.
I told you, I'm not interested in Katherine.
She's not my type.
She's not my type, either. Forget it.
Sure, I'll forget it.
But you can't forget it.
Why don't you quit fighting it, Ed?
After all, she's beautiful and she's smart...
And she's got a great throwing arm.
Great throwing arm?
You just didn't look any further.
Remember the night we saw her swimming in the pool?
Remember?
No.
"No," he says.
In that gold bathing suit.
You're drooling.
Yeah, but Shirley's my type.
Yeah. She's kind of timid and sort of shy.
You should've seen me sweep her off her feet.
That's what they like, the rough stuff.
You got to treat them rough.
Caveman stuff.
They like that caveman stuff.
She hits me over the head with her own club...
...slings me over her shoulder, carries me out of the cave into the woods.
And what'd you do?
I don't know. I was unconscious.
You missed the best part of the dream.
You think so?
- Mr. Lorgan, how are you?
- Fine.
I'd like to have a chat with you.
I'll get a newspaper.
I'll be back in a few minutes.
Won't you have a chair, Mr. Lorgan?
What's on your mind?
I liked the way you handled yourself last night at the clambake.
Yes, sir, I liked it a lot.
Thank you, Mr. Lorgan.
What are you leading up to?
A job.
I'm thinking of opening up a café.
Big, swanky place for the carriage trade.
You know, I could use you as a show.
That's swell, but what about Dennis?
He's my partner, you know.
- I think we can work that out.
- Good.
How much will you pay?
You've been getting a lot of publicity.
I can double your last vaudeville salary.
- It's a deal.
- Good. When can you start?
Not until after the baseball season's over.
Not till then?
You don't think I could walk out now, do you?
We've practically got the pennant cinched.
I'm not interested in baseball.
I've got a chorus of girls waiting, ready to start to rehearse.
Thirty of them.
Thirty girls.
A bevy of beauties.
I'm sorry you can't make it.
Wait a minute.
Couldn't you hold off for a while?
The baseball season's almost over.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
Are you going to be in town for a while?
Sure. The season finishes here.
Couldn't you arrange to get away at nights for rehearsals?
No. I couldn't do that.
Then there's no use of talking any more.
- So long, Eddie.
- Wait a minute.
Look, I'll do it, but...
I'll do it, but keep it quiet, will you?
Sure. I wouldn't want to get you in a jam.
I'll tell you what. I'll call you tomorrow to tell you when we start rehearsals.
- So long.
- So long.
- So long, fellows.
- So long.
- How do you know it'll work?
- With Eddie? It's a cinch.
Didn't you see his face when I told him there'd be 30 chorus girls?
Look what one dame did to a guy named Samson.
Who was he, a fighter?
I'm all set. I'll get the act framed.
Then when the season's over, you're in.
Of course,
I'll have to sneak out every night.
You'll cover up for me, won't you?
What else can I do? I'm your pal.
That a boy!
You can't rehearse all night and play ball the next day.
A few bad breaks, we can lose the pennant!
Quit worrying, will you?
I can handle it. I'm in great shape.
WOLVES DEFENDING
PENNANT LEAD AT HOME
Wolves Lead Dwindles
Wolves Drop Four Straight
Pass me the milk, will you, Ray?
"Wolves continue slump in game with Chicago.
"The Wolves dropped another game today to Chicago...
"...who swept to a 6-5 victory aided by a flurry of last inning hits...
"...and three startling errors by..."
By shortstop, Eddie O'Brien.
Go ahead, read it.
What's got into him, anyway?
The kid's lost his pep. No coordination, no zip. He plays like a tired old man.
He ain't tired. He's been hitting the hay early every night. In fact, too early.
- That's very unusual for O'Brien.
- I should say so.
Something's eating him.
What do the other boys say?
Have they got any ideas?
No, not exactly.
- Come on, what is it?
- It's nothing.
If O'Brien stays in this slump, we can kiss the pennant goodbye.
So if you have any ideas, open up.
Come on.
Tell her.
It's really got two angles, see?
You take a race horse.
He's going great, winning every out.
But, all of a sudden he starts looking around.
He's getting restless, see?
What has O'Brien got to be restless about?
It's like he says, you take that race horse when he starts looking around...
...he's looking at another nag.
With a ribbon in her hair.
That sounds like a pretty silly reason for losing ball games.
But, if O'Brien wants to chase the girls, let him.
Who's stopping him?
As long as he keeps decent hours.
Yes, that other angle.
What else is bothering our little race horse?
You.
Me?
You're the other nag.
I'm the...
Really?
You want me to play up to O'Brien, so we'll win the pennant, is that it?
Can you think of a better reason?
No, of course not.
Personally, I'm only interested in his batting average.
I can't rehearse all night and play ball in the afternoon. I need some rest.
Get someone else. I'm through.
You'll have all next week to rest.
I don't care about your ball playing.
I've got to get this show set.
And I got to play baseball.
I feel like a heel letting the team down.
That pennant means extra dough to those guys.
I don't like that kind of talk.
Don't threaten me!
I'm not coming down, not tonight or any night.
I think that boy needs a little talking to.
Hello, Eddie.
Hiya.
What's your hurry?
I'm tired. I'm gonna hit the hay.
Wait a minute.
Let's have a little talk?
Just you and me?
Come on.
If it's about my batting average, there's nothing left to talk about.
That's why I want to get some sleep.
That's just it.
Maybe you're getting too much sleep.
That can happen, too, you know.
You see, it's this way.
You're just like a horse.
I mean, a racehorse.
You're all nerves.
You're too finely trained...
...and all of a sudden, after you win a race, well...
...you start looking around.
What am I looking at?
Don't you know?
It's a long time since I've been a racehorse.
Anyway, Eddie, what I'm trying to say is that...
...maybe you're getting restless.
You should relax more.
Get out and just bust out. You know?
I really think it might do you some good.
Get yourself a girl, maybe, and just...
...bust out.
What girl am I gonna...
..."bust out" with?
I don't know, but...
...if you can't find one...
...there's always me.
You?
You want to go out with me?
You're asking me?
It's for the team.
Sure, the team.
Your batting average, you know.
Sure, I know.
You've been making errors.
Am I making one now?
You're the prettiest manager in baseball.
You're certainly the prettiest shortstop.
I've been a foul ball up to now...
...but it's all gonna be different from here in.
Goodnight, Miss Higgins.
Eddie, wait.
Don't you want to bust out?
Right now all that counts is winning that pennant.
I'll take a rain check on the other.
I'm going to lay that pennant right at your feet.
But, baby, when I do, we're gonna bust out in every town in this league.
Hello, Eddie.
I hope I'm not intruding.
Good evening, Miss Higgins.
Run along. I'll see you tomorrow.
This is why you missed the rehearsal tonight?
I thought you said you needed a rest.
Rehearsal? What's he talking about?
Doesn't she know?
He's been rehearsing every night for the past couple of weeks.
Rehearsing every night?
For a show that I'm putting on.
The girls are gonna miss you tonight.
They need you badly.
- The girls?
- Listen, I'll explain all this tomorrow.
From now on, they can have him.
And the team can get along without him for the rest of the season.
Personally, I can get along without him for the rest of my life.
I guess I can get along without you, too,
Eddie, from now on.
It's beginning to penetrate my thick skull.
You must've bet a lot of money against the Wolves.
The little boy's beginning to get smart.
So you played me for a sucker.
I had to protect my investment.
There's no point in giving you the routine...
...about baseball being a great game, and keeping it clean for the kids.
- You'd just be wasting your time.
- That's what I thought.
Come on.
Wolves In Slump As O'Brien Shelved
PENNANT PLAY-OFF TODAY
Come on, folks. Get a program before the game starts. Program.
We want O'Brien. We want O'Brien.
Louder!
We want O'Brien!
This is the guy they need.
No, he went all to pieces.
What do you mean all to pieces?
Anybody can have a slump once in a while.
Look.
We want O'Brien!
Louder.
We want O'Brien! We want O'Brien!
I knew it was you, Eddie.
It's O'Brien, fellas. He's sitting right here.
Get in there and play!
Nobody asked me.
We'll carry you if it'll do any good.
Holy smoke! Look, it's Eddie!
Hey, Eddie!
That a boy, Eddie!
What are you going to do?
There's nothing to be done.
It won't hurt to talk to him.
Mike, there's nothing to talk about.
He's probably in no condition to play.
- Put him out there and see.
- We have plenty of time before the game.
No.
You can talk to him if you want to.
That a boy, Eddie! Get in there!
If he goes in, we can kiss our $20,000 goodbye.
You give up too easily.
What are you talking about?
What $20,000?
- Have you boys been betting against them?
- Shut up!
O'Brien mustn't play today, boys.
- That's it.
- Okay.
A change in the line-up for today's game.
O'Brien at shortstop for the Wolves.
Denny, come here.
- What are you doing here?
- They're gonna get him!
- Get who?
- Eddie. They're out to get him!
- What?
- I heard Lorgan and his men talking.
They've bet a lot of money against the Wolves.
They're bad luck!
They won't stop at anything!
- You've got to tell Eddie not to play.
- He'd play anyway.
But you've got to stop him from playing!
Sure. Stop him from playing.
Yeah, I'll stop him.
How about giving them the old routine, the gag?
- You got the soft ball?
- Right there.
Come on, let me have it.
Hurry up. Let me have it.
Fellas, come here. I think he's hurt.
Get a doctor!
Is there a doctor?
- Looks as if our boy was really hurt.
- Yeah. What do you know?
- I'm Dr. Winston.
- Right here, Doc.
- Open up, boys.
- Here he is, Doctor.
Better get him to the locker room.
- Get him up. Take it easy. Go ahead.
- Take it easy, boys.
There ain't nothing left for us to do.
Maybe he's stunned for a few minutes.
We must keep him out.
They don't know you. Pretend you're doctors and keep O'Brien out.
He'll be out, Joe.
Take it easy now, boys.
- Put him right down here.
- Careful with him, very careful.
- Give me room, boys. I'm Dr. Karl.
- I'm Dr. Stevens.
- How is he?
- It may be a concussion.
Concussion?
- Get out of here. We'll take care of him.
- Boys, back in the field.
Come on, Miss Higgins. He'll be all right.
I don't suppose you have a stethoscope with you?
Just caught me short.
Why don't you run along?
We don't all have to be here.
Thank you very much.
I would like to see the game.
What is it?
It's 2:10.
Run along and enjoy the game.
That's a nice fellow.
- He's a light sleeper, ain't he?
- Yeah.
Call it.
- Heads.
- You win.
He's safe!
He's safe!
- How is he?
- They say they may have to operate.
What?
Denny, what's all this about gamblers?
- Who told you?
- Shirley did.
Don't you start that!
I know you knocked him out on purpose.
Look, I was in a spot.
You don't want a dead shortstop, do you?
Why didn't you call the cops?
I was scared. Why didn't you tell me?
How did I know you were gonna bean him with a hard ball?
- Have you seen him?
- He's still out.
The doctors won't let me in.
They're gonna operate.
Operate! In there? That's impossible!
- That's what they're saying.
- I'm going in there.
Is it that bad?
You hit him next time, will you?
My knuckles are getting sore.
You can't come in here!
- Why not?
- Doctor's orders, and I'm the doctor!
This man's been hurt very bad.
Shut the door and get out of here!
Those two aren't doctors! Come on, quick.
You can't come in here!
He's safe.
Hold it!
Hold it! Enough!
He's safe!
There they are, Officer!
Wait a minute. What's the hurry?
Stop him somebody! Denny!
Stop him!
Just a second.
I hardly touched him.
I guess I don't know my own strength.
- Take him away, fellows.
- Come on, boys.
All right, play ball! Batter up!
Get in there and send Goldberg around.
Just watch me.
- Slappy, is he still out?
- Yeah.
I don't think he's seriously hurt,
Miss Higgins. He's merely stunned.
Darling!
Darling, please, look at me!
Eddie, can you talk? How do you feel?
I feel fine.
I feel wonderful.
Then you just lie right here and don't you move.
Who's moving?
Darling, I was so worried when
Dennis hit you on the head with the ball.
Where is he?
I'll murder him! I'll kill him!
Let me go!
He did it on purpose!
No, Eddie, he didn't!
Wait a minute! Hold it!
Let me at him!
Let me at him!
Get a hit. You can catch him.
Yeah! Give me a bat.
I can explain the whole thing.
Come on, Eddie!
Eddie, stop!
Eddie, stop!
Wait!

THE END
"While the Harvey system neither demands nor expects...
"...the impossible from any employee, it does insist upon honest...
"...excellent, hygienic, cleanly, prompt and cheerful service at all times."
Yes, siree, Bob.
And he means every word of it.
You've been with him a long time.
I've been cooking in Harvey Houses for the last 14 years.
You must be well-done by now.
Madame! You say your coffee is weak?
Give it to me.
I'll put it on the chair and let it rest awhile.
Just call me "Conscientious Connie," the queen of the waitresses!
I'm sorry, Miss Bliss.
That's all right, Ethel.
There's one thing you girls have yet to learn:
A Harvey girl is more than a waitress.
Wherever a Harvey House appears, civilization is not far behind.
You girls are the symbol and the promise of the order that is to come.
The restaurant we're opening in Sandrock is the first the town has ever had.
Its success depends upon how you conduct yourselves.
Now, how about some lunch?
It's lovely. I'm hungry.
- Here, let me help you.
- Thank you.
Have you ever eaten a Chillicothe sandwich, Deborah?
- Chillicothe? What's that?
- It's a secret recipe of my Aunt Melvina's.
Won her two blue ribbons and three husbands.
- Try it to see if you like it.
- No, thanks. I'm full.
- Would you like to try it?
- Why, yes. Thank you very much.
I always wanted to taste a Chillicothe sandwich.
Tastes just like chicken.
You have to try another before you can tell the difference.
Thank you. I hope I'm not depriving you.
If General Custer had our provisions, he'd still be standing.
I've wanted to meet you ever since we got on the train at Kansas City.
My name is Susan Bradley. I'm from Ohio.
- We're Harvey girls.
- What's that, a college?
No. We're waitresses.
We're going to Sandrock to open a restaurant.
Sandrock! That's where I'm going.
- Is that your home?
- No.
- Are you visiting?
- No.
- Going to work?
- Then why on earth are you going?
To get married.
- Does he live in Sandrock?
- Yes, he owns a big ranch there.
- What's his name?
- His name is H.H. Hartsey, Esquire.
Is he tall and handsome, and does he have raven-black hair?
And flashing blue eyes?
I like brown eyes.
- His are brown.
- You said they were blue.
Well, they are. I mean, one of them is.
I mean...
Well, to tell you the truth,
I haven't met him yet.
- How did you catch him?
- I answered a matrimonial ad in the paper.
Well, really!
I once sent my picture to a lonely hearts club...
...but it came back marked,
"We're not that lonely!"
Well, I think it's wonderful.
I think it's wonderful, too.
When I answered the ad, he wrote back.
Thank you very much.
- What wonderful curlicues.
- And commas after everything.
This is the first one.
- Would you like to hear a little of it?
- Yes, indeed. Please.
"There is a dream here, in this great land, that not everybody sees.
"Mountains and sunlight, and the cleanest wind in the world...
"...waiting for a man and a woman with a little vision."
What was so wrong with Ohio?
There was nothing wrong with Ohio.
It was just so old-fashioned.
There were several men in that town
I could have married, I suppose.
Only, it's so smug and sure of itself and so settled...
...that I wanted a chance to do something different...
...to see something different, a whole new world opening up.
And, after all, the Constitution guarantees the pursuit of happiness...
...but it's up to me to do the pursuing.
So that's why I answered the ad, and that's why I'm on this train.
I think you did the right thing.
- Would you like to see my wedding dress?
- Yes.
I must say, I admire your spirit.
Most girls would have come out here and gotten married in a navy blue suit.
That must be Sandrock!
Mrs. H.H. Hartsey, Esquire.
Mighty nice looking sign you're putting up there, Mr. Adams.
You being the manager of the place...
...I suppose you're optimistic enough to think it's going to stay there.
There are a lot of them around the country, Judge...
...and I haven't heard of any of them failing to stay put.
It's a pity you'll be disillusioned so soon.
- Hi, Judge.
- Hi, boys.
- How are you, Judge?
- Good day, Judge.
Hello, John Henry.
Hey, Mike, where's the boss?
Right over there.
Trent, I want to talk to you.
There's a lady singing.
- That's a good number.
- Terry taught it to me.
- Good work, Terry.
- Thanks.
- It's really Em's voice that puts them over.
- My voice? He's so young.
Trent, I got to talk to you.
What is stopping you, Sam?
The lady's finished her song.
- Hey, boss.
- Yeah?
- Is he good for a drink?
- Has he had it?
- Yeah.
- He's good.
Now, look here, Trent,
I've wasted all the time I've got to waste.
Got a match?
Mighty nice looking place you got here.
Next year, we plan to put up lace curtains.
Not if you have to shut down, you won't.
Who's going to shut us down? You?
You know what I mean.
You can't laugh off the new Harvey outfit.
Have you ever seen a restaurant?
They serve food.
Next, the church will open up again.
Mark my words.
Are you boys admiring each other's eyes or reading each other's epitaphs?
Em, the Judge is losing his grip.
He's afraid of a place that sells vittles.
Vittles and a pack of calf-faced girls.
Those girls can fill up a town faster than law officers.
- You listen to the Judge, Ned.
- This is my business.
Let's get one thing straight:
We're not partners.
You run the town, I'll run the Alhambra.
You'll get your usual cut.
But not just as much.
He's right. Look what happened at Larrup.
The men married the waitresses faster than they could replace them.
They did?
It's so quiet, you'd think it was
New England instead of New Mexico.
- Nice women can ruin a town, right?
- And how.
- The house will buy you a drink.
- That's a little better.
- Where's Trent?
- He's over there, at the bar.
Hey, Ned!
It's all due to you.
- How can I ever thank you?
- What?
- My bride's coming in on the noon train.
- You're married, Hartsey?
I ain't, but I will be.
She's come all the way out here from Ohio to marry me.
And here's the fellow what's done it.
It was him. He writ the letters for me.
He courted her for me on paper.
Hartsey, maybe you'd better hightail it to the desert.
- I'll meet her and send her back to Ohio.
- It's like a blind date for life.
You don't know what you're doing.
You can't tell by letters.
She probably weighs 200 pounds.
That's all right.
This calls for a celebration.
Hey, everybody.
Hartsey will be married this afternoon.
I'll treat to champagne.
Here's to H.H. Hartsey and his rosy happiness...
...coming in on the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe.
Do you hear that whistle down the line?
I figure that it's engine number forty-nine,
She's the only one that'll sound that way.
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe!
See the ol' smoke risin' round the bend,
I reckon that she knows she's gonna meet a friend,
Folks around these parts get the time o' day
From the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe!
Here she comes!
Ooh, ooh, ooh,
Hey, Jim! yuh better git the rig!
Ooh, ooh, ooh,
She's got a list o' passengers that's pretty big
And they'll all want lifts to Brown's Hotel,
'Cause lots o' them been travelin' for quite a spell, on the way to Cal-i-forn-i-ay
On the Atchison, Topeka
On the Atchison, Topeka
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe!
Oh, the roads back East are mighty swell,
The Chesapeake, Ohio and the A. S. L.
But I make my run and I make my pay,
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe.
Goin' back 'n forth along these aisles,
My lands, you must'a walked about a million miles
It's a treat to be on your feet all day
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe.
Here we come!
Here she comes, comin' down the line.
Raa-du-raa, du-raa, du-ra-ra-raa.
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe!
She's really racin' down the line.
Choo-choo-choo, choo-choo-choo, Santa Fe!
Looky, looky, looky, looky look!
Atchison, Topeka, Santa Fe!
Oh, boy, we're huffin' an' a-puffin' on the Forty-nine!
In this day and age, girls don't leave home,
But if ya get a hankerin' you wanna roam,
Our advice to you is run away
On the Atchison, Topeka an' the Santa Fe!
Faith and didja ever see such purty femininity
Arrivin' all at once in this h'yere town?
In this h'yere town?
Never seen the likes o' this for miles aroun'.
Round and round our heads are spinning,
New adventures are beginning.
What a length a gal'll go in tarfety 'n calico
To really put a cowboy on the bosh!
Cowboy!
Cowboy!
Kibosh!
Kibosh!
It's enough to make a feller wanna,
Wash your face and hands, we hope, you'll never be afraid of soap!
Button shoes and powdered chalk,
An' fancy smells and baby talk
Hit's awful what a gal'll stoop to do!
Even so, we aim to say,
We'd love to honor and obey, Bee!
Are there any more at home like you?
Hand me my hair-comb and my stickum,
Gonna get spruced up and out-trick 'em.
Put on the dog and out-city slick 'em.
Mister Harvey, Mister Harvey,
Fred Harvey knows exactly how to pick 'em.
We come from Dubuque, I-oway,
That's where the tall, tall, tall corn grows;
We come from Lousiana
Where the Miss-iss-iss-iss-ippi flows.
I was the Lillian Russell of Cherryville, Kansas, but they never gave me a chance!
I finished high school in
Providence, Rhode Island, and Providence, Rhode Island, is where I learned to dance!
Oh, I'm from Chillicothee,
Ohio!
My middle name's Hiawathy.
Ohio!
I'm gonna get the gold in them thar hills,
So, I said goodbye-o, Ohio.
We were schoolmarms from Grand Rapids, Mich,
Readin', writin', 'rithmetic were not our dish.
I was born in Paris,
I was raised in Paris,
Went to school in Paris, where I met a boy.
I was married in Paris, almost buried in Paris, but I finally left Paris...
Paris, Illinois!
So, this is the wild and the wooly West,
Give me my chaps and my checker'd vest!
Get me a gun and a holster for my hip,
Bang, bang!
Yip, yip!
What a lovely trip,
I'm feeling so fresh and alive.
And I'm so glad to arrive,
It's all so grand.
It's easy to see,
You don't need a palace,
To feel like Alice in Wonderland.
Back in Ohio, where I come from,
I've done a lot of dreamin' and I've travell'd some,
But I never thought I'd see the day
When I ever took a ride on the Santa Fe
Wanna take a ride on the Santa Fe!
I would lean across my window sill,
And hear the whistle echoing across the hill;
Then I'd watch the lights till they'd fade away,
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe.
- What a thrill!
- What a great big wonderful thrill!
With the wheels a-singin' Westward Ho!
Right from the day I heard them start.
'Cross the Kansas plains through New Mexico,
I guess I got a little gypsy in my heart.
When I'm old and gray and settled down, if I ever get a chance to sneak away from town, then I'll spend my busman's holiday. on the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe.
All aboard!
We came across the country lickety-split.
Goin' ninety miles an hour, fit to be tied.
I can't believe we're here at last.
When you go traveling, it's natch for you to take the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe!
I can't believe that anything would go so fast!
Then your pullin' throttle, whistle blows
A-huffin' and a-puffin' and away she goes
All aboard for Californi-a!
- On the Atchison...
- On the Atchison...
- On the Atchison, Topeka...
- On the Atchison, Topeka...
- On the Atchison, Topeka and...
- On the Atchison, Topeka and...
On the Atchison, Topeka an' the Santa Fe!
- Miss Bliss?
- Yes.
- I'm Jed Adams.
- How do you do?
- Welcome to Sandrock.
- Thank you.
I want you to meet Mr. Adams, the Harvey House manager.
Miss Walters, Miss Johnson,
Miss Harper...
Why, you rambunctious coyote!
I'll teach you.
- Wait a minute, ma'am. I'm Mr. Hartsey.
- I don't care who you are.
But, ma'am, ain't you Miss Susan Bradley, the lady that came out here to marry me?
That's Miss Susan Bradley back there.
If you ladies will please follow me.
We've been awaiting your arrival.
Really? That's very nice.
Who are they?
Ladies! Ladies!
How do, Miss Bradley?
Hello, Mr. Hartsey.
- Can I carry your bag, ma'am?
- My bag? Where?
I thought we was going down here to...
Yes, please, do. Thank you very much.
- Are you disappointed?
- Disappointed?
Well, I mean, you didn't expect a mangy old buzzard like me, or did you?
Yes, I did. I mean,
I don't think you're a mangy old buzzard.
I mean, I...
You look like a very kind and reasonable man.
Then you like me?
You mean you really like me?
I, of course, don't know you very well, but you...
...certainly look to me like a very kind and reasonable man.
Thank you, ma'am. I like you, too.
Thank you.
Of course, there's one thing I forgot.
I left it out of my letters.
I'm an awful housekeeper.
That's all right.
In these parts, we live outside mostly, anyways.
- I'm a terrible cook.
- Don't let that worry you, ma'am.
Out here, we just put things over a fire and take what happens.
Well, that's just fine, isn't it?
It's great. I can't wait for us to be hitched up, can you?
Can't wait.
- I'm going to be the happiest man in town.
- I'm going to be the happiest girl.
Well, after all, that's what I came out here for, isn't it?
Well, yes, ma'am.
Miss Bradley, I think you should know something more about me.
I chew tobacco and I drink.
I'm a terrible drinker.
And I gamble.
Gambling, that's my downfall.
Well, Mr. Hartsey, you sound as if you...
Could it be possible you don't want to marry me?
Wait, Miss Bradley. I want to marry you.
I want to marry you badly.
I want to marry you something awful, but please, ma'am...
...please say no.
Mr. Hartsey, I think you're wonderful.
Of course, if you insist, I'll say no.
I sure do thank you, ma'am.
Well, anyway,
I thought your letters were beautiful.
Gosh, I didn't even write them letters.
They was written by a fellow named Ned Trent.
Who's Ned Trent?
That was Ned's idea, all in the first place.
You know, I bet he thought that'd be some kind of a funny joke like.
- A joke?
- Yes, ma'am.
You mean,
I've come 2,000 miles for a joke?
- Where will I find this Ned Trent?
- Well, he's right inside there, ma'am.
Miss Bradley, you can't go in there.
Pardon me, which one is Mr. Trent?
- The guy over there without the hat.
- Thank you.
- Mr. Trent. Mr. Trent.
- See me later, I'm busy.
Wait a minute.
- Mr. Trent!
- Go away, will you?
Not until I've talked to you.
If it's about a job, grab a drink and I'll see you later.
- A drink?
- Open.
Call and raise.
- How many, Trent?
- Two cards.
How many?
Holding a kicker?
My grandfather always said that...
Hang your grandfather!
If he were alive, it's more than likely he'd hang you.
Who are you?
What are you doing in this place?
I'm just somebody who doesn't like you,
Mr. Trent.
I don't know if you're a thief or a murderer, but I know one thing: You're worse.
I never met, or read, or heard of anyone lower than you are.
You're a yellow-dog, Mr. Trent. Good day.
- Who was that?
- I don't know...
...but I'm sure going to find out.
Hey, wait a minute!
What was that all about, miss?
"When the setting sun lowers its mantle of gold...
"...over the valley that shall be our home..."
The letters! You're Hartsey's...
- But you couldn't be!
- Well, I am.
Susan Bradley.
Well, look, take this and go on back to Ohio.
Nothing's happened...
...except that a nice girl has had an interesting trip.
Oh, wouldn't you love it if I went back to Ohio?
Me and the other nice girls who came out here today!
Well, they won't.
Whatever you and the other cutthroats do, we won't.
Listen to me. If anybody leaves here, it'll be you and your kind.
Men who run gambling palaces and send lying letters to girls...
...and sell a lot of liquor to drunkards.
Before we're finished with this town, you'll swallow those letters you wrote...
...and yes, I hope you choke on them, too!
- Miss Bliss.
- Yes, Susan?
You've got yourself another Harvey girl.
Dining room to the left.
Lunch counter to the right.
Ample notice will be given before the departure of the train.
- Hi, Goldust. When did you blow in?
- Just passing through.
You've got too much class for these prairie dogs.
Come to the coast with me.
No dice, Goldust. Keep asking.
It's good for my morale.
- Going to have supper with me?
- As a matter of fact, I'm dining out.
- Harvey House?
- I'll stroll over and size up the competition.
Yours or mine?
What do you mean?
I'd still like to know what was in those letters.
If I did, I'd probably know you as well as you know me.
It's no mystery, Em.
Why do you go out alone in the desert all the time?
- Who said I do?
- Everybody knows you do.
What have you got buried in that valley?
You wouldn't believe this, Em, but I've got nothing in that valley.
It's nice to look at.
See you later.
- Your order, sir?
- I'll have a great big sirloin steak.
One steak.
- Welcome to the Harvey House.
- Thank you, Miss Bradley.
- How would you like your steak?
- Rare.
Rare. Potatoes?
- Just the steak.
- Just the steak.
If you can get it.
We're famous for our steaks, Mr. Trent.
We'll have your steak in a minute, sir.
Hey! What did she do that for?
I wasn't finished.
It's because of your manners.
In a place like this, you don't blow on your soup.
You fan it with your hat.
One sirloin steak, rare.
- We ain't got it.
- What?
No roast beef or lamb chops...
...and not a single one of those famous Harvey steaks.
- The meat's disappeared.
- And so has our manager.
I think I know what's happened.
- Anything could have happened.
- You think somebody stole all that?
I'm looking forward to the steak.
You shall have it, Mr. Trent.
Get out, you drunk!
Stick 'em up!
Come on. Stick 'em up, now!
Anybody that gets in my way...
...you're going to have to answer for the consequences.
So, come on. Stick 'em up!
Watch out, men. Be careful!
I'd rather have Deadeye Dick than a female with a gun in her hand!
Now, I'm from the Harvey House.
We got a lot of hungry people there waiting to be served.
And I don't want to hurt anybody.
Honestly, I don't!
But we're famous for our steaks, and I'm not going to let anybody stop me.
So, come on, get 'em up. Put 'em up!
That's right.
Now, you, tell me where that meat is or I'll shoot.
What meat?
Lady, your meat's in there.
Come on, boys. Get your hands up!
Mr. Adams, are you all right?
John Henry, go there and untie Mr. Adams.
I need strong men to carry this meat.
- Right away.
- Pick up the trays. Come on.
Get it back to the Harvey.
You ought to be ashamed.
We have people to feed there.
Come on, hurry up.
- Let's get moving!
- Mr. Adams, will you take this?
- John Henry, get these down here.
- Yes, ma'am.
Come on. Hurry up. March.
Come on. Out.
Thank you very much.
I just want to thank you all.
My!
Did I do that?
I am sorry,
I didn't mean to let it go off again.
You've been very kind and thank you all very much.
- Good night.
- Good night.
One steak, very rare.
Good night, Arabella.
Look at that little goose pimple, all moon-eyed over a song.
I just came out for a breath of air.
- Deborah's romantic.
- It isn't that. It's just that I like music.
Imagine coming 2,000 miles from everywhere to hear a song like that.
And from a saloon.
Why did you become a Harvey girl,
Deborah?
I thought it would be exciting.
What I really wanted to be...
...was a dancer.
But my family thought it wasn't respectable.
A dancer?
- And you, Alma?
- I lived on a farm.
- Why did you leave it?
- I was hungry.
Well, here we are.
Yes, the three of us.
I don't know if we're the three musketeers or the three blind mice.
The low-down, crawling worm.
Shooting at women!
Ladies, I'm afraid we can call that the opening gun in the battle for Sandrock.
You can fight it without me.
I'm taking the first train out of here.
Girls! Please!
You'll not let this crude theatrical demonstration frighten you.
We won't stay here to get murdered in our beds.
I'm sure, when you calm down, you'll change your mind and stay.
If I stayed, it wouldn't be because
I changed my mind, but because I lost it.
I'm leaving.
Girls...
...l'd hoped you'd have the courage to see this through.
But if you insist upon leaving...
...that's a decision which you'll have to make for yourselves.
Good afternoon, Judge.
So you're back? Still peddling religion?
Sandrock needs it a heap-sight more than folks on the circuit.
We don't aim to have a church in Sandrock.
You've already got a church in Sandrock,
Judge.
All I aim to do is reopen it.
Listen, we agreed you were going to stay out of this town.
You agreed. I didn't.
You can't scare me the way you did those girls last night.
- Bullets are an old story to me.
- What's this about bullets, Sam?
- Mind your own business, Ned.
- I'll see you later.
There's always a gun popping off.
That's how it is. Boys will be boys.
They fired a bullet into the lamp where the girls were sleeping.
That's what I mean.
No harm done, and we got rid of four of them already.
Pretty good?
Reverend Claggett, go ahead with the church.
Why, thanks, Mr. Trent.
Ned, the Reverend doesn't have a sense of humor.
- I'm not joking. Go right ahead, Reverend.
- I will.
You go over to those girls right away and tell them not to worry.
There'll be no more accidental bullets in their lives.
Wait a minute, Ned.
We're in this together, aren't we?
But let's stick to the Marquis of Queensberry rules.
We should lick a bunch of women with our hands tied behind our backs.
That's the biggest mistake you ever made.
If they want a church to let off steam in instead of the Alhambra...
...I guess the Alhambra can hold its own.
Now, go on over there and tell them.
Well, now, that's a promising idea.
I'm quite sentimental about flowers.
I was discussing it with Reverend Claggett.
Reverend?
I thought they'd closed the church.
Yes, but we aim to open it again real soon.
There are some people who don't like the idea of a church here.
Mr. Trent, for instance.
They don't like having you ladies here either...
...but we figure to overcome their objections.
Yes, indeed, beautiful flowers.
A church, lovely young ladies like you.
This town is going to be something to be proud of.
- May I?
- Surely.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
A man's apt to forget his manners in a rough country like this.
- I'm Judge Purvis.
- How do you do?
I'm Miss Susan Bradley and this is Miss Deborah Andrews.
- How do you do?
- It's nice to meet a man like you here.
The pleasure is mine.
I hope we'll see a lot of each other.
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Good day, Miss Andrews.
- Miss Bradley.
- Good day.
He's nice, isn't he?
Well, at least there's one gentleman in Sandrock.
Now I know who fired that shot...
...l'm going to do something about it right now.
Slumming, Miss Bradley?
- I was just looking for your employer.
- You've got your own backyard. Stay in it.
You certainly don't mind my coming over to pay you a little call, do you?
In return for the call you folks paid us last night?
What do you want out of Ned Trent?
Nothing.
I want to thank him for all the hospitable things he's done for us.
- You're letting it go to your head.
- Letting what go to my head?
Listen, don't fool yourself.
Ned ain't doing this for you personally.
When he told Purvis to cut out the rough stuff, it was no love message to you.
When he told Claggett to open up the church...
...it doesn't mean he'll put on a pair of white gloves...
...and cuddle up to you in the front pew.
If you meant anything, he wouldn't have sent Judge to tell you.
Ned Trent can talk for himself.
But you don't mean anything to him, see?
He don't consider you worth fighting.
He'll give you your flowers and church.
You can sleep all you want at night.
But still he won't recognize you the next time he looks at you.
You're in love with him.
Me in love with him?
Why, he don't even know I'm alive.
Him and his valley.
Valley? What valley?
He doesn't even know you're alive either.
- You're not very sure of yourself, are you?
- Listen, you little insignificant...
I may be little, and I suppose I am insignificant...
...but I must be getting somewhere, my friends and I...
...or a significant citizen like you could never be so very, very worried.
'Morning.
You the new blacksmith?
We just opened up and I...
My name is Peters.
Most people call me Marty.
Well, my name's Maule, but where I come from people call me Tex.
- Where do you come from, Tex?
- Massachusetts.
Take good care how you shoe this horse.
Last time, they done it all wrong, and I didn't like it, see.
- Horse is like my own brother.
- There is a resemblance.
That is, I mean to say, you can trust me, sir.
I'll shoe him like he was my own brother.
His shoes are about six and seven-eighths.
There's one up there.
I'll be back.
Chris! What's the matter?
Marty Peters was here. He left his horse...
Marty Peters!
The one that shot the last blacksmith?
Yeah. He seems to think a lot of this horse and... He did what?
It's really only a rumor based on circumstantial evidence.
- No eyewitnesses?
- A few...
...but nobody actually saw the bullet leave the gun.
If you're going to shoe that horse, you'd better get started.
Alma, I've a confession.
- I'm afraid of horses.
- That's all in your mind.
- Say to yourself, "I'm brave."
- I'm brave.
- "I'm determined."
- I'm determined.
- "I'm fearless."
- I'm fearless. I'm a liar.
Come ahead, Chris.
Show the horse you're not afraid of him.
Would you please sit down and give me your foot?
That's not the way, silly.
See?
It's very simple.
All you have to do is take the pincers and pry all the nails from the foot.
Then you take a rasp and file the foot down.
Then you take a hot shoe, red-hot, and burn his foot to a level.
Then he's ready for shoeing.
Place it on his foot and drive six long nails into it.
I suppose I'll have to do it.
No.
Lose something, Miss Bradley?
Mr. Trent. Do you mind if I come down?
Thank you.
This country's not healthy for a woman,
Miss Bradley.
Why? Do you mean because I tripped?
That could happen back in Ohio.
But back in Ohio they'd find you.
It's certainly a nice view from out here.
- Is this where you usually come?
- Yes. Whenever I want to be alone.
I think that's a very good idea.
Getting off by yourself every so often.
It gives you a chance to think things out.
- What are you thinking out?
- Me?
I wanted to get a good look at a fellow...
...who'd run a saloon on one side and help a church on the other.
You're a little bit mixed up.
I'm not helping any church.
My, your valley is beautiful, Mr. Trent.
Almost as beautiful as your letters.
I said I was sorry about the letters.
I'm not angry about that.
I've forgotten about it.
I know you had a reason.
You did it for a friend.
It was kind of like John Alden.
Alden?
Yes. Don't you know the story?
Well, it seems there was a man in love with a girl.
Priscilla, her name was.
And he sent John Alden to propose for him.
John Alden said he would.
It's a wonderful story.
Anyway, right after John Alden finished proposing...
...Priscilla looked at him and said,
"Why don't you speak for yourself, John?"
Go on. How does it end?
I don't know. It's pretty silly.
I don't think you'd like it.
Why not?
I like all the things Longfellow wrote.
Miss Bradley, do you mind if I ask you something?
Do you suppose if I wrote a letter, a serious letter, that...
...some girl might be willing to marry me?
I suppose judging by me, Mr. Trent, that she'd take you like that.
I don't know.
Sometimes you don't even have to write.
That's a lot of trouble.
Sometimes all you have to do is that.
Some girls are just a little harder to get than others.
- Like girls from Ohio?
- Yes, Ohio will do. Yes.
Thanks for the story, Miss Bradley.
- You'd better get back to town.
- No, I think I'll stay here.
- It's not safe for a woman alone.
- Really, what could happen?
You could pitch off that cliff.
- We've got cliffs in Ohio.
- There are coyotes.
- What else?
- Not to mention a few million snakes.
We've got snakes in Ohio, too. What else?
You got that in Ohio, too?
Yes, we've got plenty of that in Ohio...
Here, here, what's the matter?
You all right?
Of course, I'm all right.
I bet you think that's the first time I've ever been kissed.
Isn't it?
Big, strong man.
I bet you carry smelling salts when you go out with a girl.
- Did you want some?
- No!
- It's been a lovely afternoon, Mr. Trent.
- I enjoyed it, too, Miss Bradley.
- And now we part.
- Right.
And you disappear back...
...into the gilt and glitter of your charming establishment.
How many men do you think would stay here without the Alhambra?
Sure the men drink and dance in my place...
...and some of them lose their money...
...but at least they get something in return.
Fun, excitement...
...and a couple of hours of diversion.
And a headache and an empty pocketbook the next morning.
I was just going to pick up my slippers, and there it was.
- She might have been bitten.
- Or any of us.
I don't know why I ever came to this horrible place, I'm leaving.
Me, too.
Strange. How could a snake have gotten into that closet?
Is this your idea of fun, excitement, and a little diversion, Mr. Trent?
I told you we're fighting fair, didn't I?
- You can't fight fair and take their side.
- I killed the snake.
It doesn't matter, anyone could've done it.
The men who put the snake in there are still alive.
And you won't shoot them because they're your customers.
I just killed one of your pets, Sam.
- I don't get it.
- Get this.
If anything else happens to the Harvey girls, you'll answer to me.
- You joined up with the petticoats?
- I haven't joined anything.
All I'm saying to you is, lay off.
It's my turn. I'll get the next basket.
Hello.
Hello. I was just passing by and heard your song.
Do you like it?
It's beautiful.
I heard you singing it the other night.
I hoped you were listening.
Deborah.
- I wondered what happened to you.
- I heard the music and...
Susan, this is Mr...
O'Halloran, miss. Terry O'Halloran.
I hope you don't think there's anything wrong.
No. Of course,
I don't think there's anything wrong.
Let's get out of here.
Listen. Wait a minute.
My intentions are honorable.
Honestly, I mean, no fooling!
Miss Bradley.
I'll be along in just a moment.
Quite a run on Harvey girls we're having this morning.
Was there another matrimonial ad in some paper?
Look, miss, we hardly know each other, so suppose we keep it that way.
Just a minute.
I hear you and the Harvey girls are having a little party tonight.
It's a big party.
Don't you think you should stick to dishwashing?
We're minding our own business.
Suppose you stick to your own profession.
Our profession is entertainment, see.
And we don't like competition.
Well, we're amateurs.
Don't tell me you're afraid of us?
Afraid of you?
- Who are you kidding?
- Come on.
- Let me at her.
- Come on.
My arm!
You're tearing my dress.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Good evening.
- Won't you go in?
- Thank you.
Now, for the pièce de résistance!
Folks, we'll teach you a brand-new dance.
It's the first dance where a fellow puts his arm around the lady's waist.
It's a brand-new dance that's all the rage way back East...
...in Kansas City.
All right, girls, line up and demonstrate the waltz.
That's very good, girls.
Now, get yourselves partners.
Come on, boys. Join in.
Let's all have a good time.
- Come on. Let's have a good time.
- I tell you, I can't do it, so help me, ma'am.
Anybody want our tickets?
I'll go, Miss Bliss.
- I'll take your tickets.
- It's our turn to go slumming.
Thank you.
All right, folks.
Step lively now, and everybody choose your partners for the waltz.
Well, go ahead, ladies, choose your partners.
I'll bet you're glad to see me, Bucky-boy.
See you later. I'm already took.
- Hello, mister. Dancing?
- Yes, ma'am. I'd be right...
I'm sure he'd like to, but you see, he has a very bad leg.
Well, maybe some other time.
Well, Miss Cassidy, I ain't got no bad leg.
You have now.
- Now you're acting more like a man, Ned.
- I feel better myself.
Quite a little contest we're having.
Last year, if you didn't like somebody, you settled it with your fists or a gun.
- Now we dance it out, don't we?
- We're doing all right, I'm proud of us.
- All right, girls, we don't belong here.
- Let's go where we do belong.
Any of you gentlemen like to join us?
- How about you, Sam?
- It would be a pleasure, Ned.
Any of you gentlemen care for a little recreation?
Miss Bradley, something wonderful has happened.
Look at that.
Do you realize what's going on?
That's mighty fine, Reverend Claggett.
- It's wonderful.
- Yes.
It's more than that.
On this night, the male population of Sandrock, for the first time...
...turned down a wild time in favor of a good time.
Did you lose something, Mr. Trent?
Yes. I lost a fight, Miss Bradley.
The gingham curtains and the flower pots get the decision.
You mean you're giving up?
Not exactly.
There's a mining town, Flagstaff, about 100 miles from here.
That's where Alhambra's planning to move.
When?
Tomorrow morning, the breakfast train.
Is that what you came up here to tell me?
Yes.
What do you expect me to say?
I don't know.
I guess I hoped you'd be glad.
It might make it easier for me to leave.
All right then, I'm glad.
I only wish you'd left a long time ago.
So do I.
Maybe it wouldn't have happened then.
- What?
- Meeting you.
Yes, that was bad, wasn't it?
Two people as far apart as we are.
Yes.
Now, for the first time in my life,
I've got things to remember.
I take it that you don't like memories,
Mr. Trent.
They don't pay off.
They keep you awake nights.
Will you be awake many nights, Ned?
Every night.
I'll be wondering if I should've stayed.
Well, you couldn't.
If you did, it wouldn't make any difference, you'd be giving in to me.
A thing like this can't be one-sided.
We'd both have to give in.
Both of us together.
Where would that put us?
No place in this world...
...because it just can't be done.
Goodbye, Susan.
Can't leave you alone for a minute, can I?
Now, put out that fire.
- Sam, I won't let you do this.
- You're not? We'll see.
We're going to the Alhambra to have a little talk.
Go ahead.
This way, ladies and gentlemen.
Temporary quarters across the street.
Ample notice will be given before the departure of the train.
Right across the street.
Temporary quarters across the street.
Trust me, after this town,
Flagstaff will be a pleasure.
Do you want some sugar?
Em, I'll see you on the train.
All aboard!
- Where are you going, Ned?
- I don't know myself.
- Well, come on inside.
- Leave me alone. I've got to think.
You can think inside.
I'm sorry, Em...
...but I'm afraid my traveling days are over.
Divvy this up with the girls and say goodbye to them for me.
All right. Stay in Sandrock.
And thanks.
Thanks for nothing.
Goodbye.
- What happened to Trent?
- I gave him his walking papers.
Em, do you mean what you're not saying?
Every word of it.
I'll buy San Francisco and put it around your wrist like a bracelet.
I'll put it in your hair like a crown.
I've got a present for the girls in the next car.
Well, greetings from the Atchison,
Topeka and the Santa Fe.
Hello.
I bet we're going 40 miles an hour.
We're getting further and further away from Sandrock every second.
Yes, I guess so.
We should be in Flagstaff in a couple of hours.
Are you planning to stop there by the way?
I'll stop there if he does.
He?
Who?
Ned Trent.
What are you going to do in Flagstaff, wait on tables?
I don't know, but I will if he wants me to.
Look, would you accept an apology?
I'm afraid that maybe I was wrong.
I mean, you see,
I'm from a little town in Ohio.
I probably acted like a snob about girls like you.
I mean, what I thought girls like you were like.
And after all, it's only a matter of style, isn't it?
I mean, some people wear one kind of dress...
...other people wear another.
And this certainly is the barren...
...blistered end of creation out here.
I don't know.
Maybe it's good for the men to have a little entertainment.
You mean you want to join us girls?
I'd like to try.
You'd do that for him?
Well, that's what he wants, isn't it?
- What?
- You're getting off this train.
- No, I'm going to Flagstaff.
- You are.
No, please, don't.
I don't want to get off.
I'll go where he goes.
- He's not on this train. Look.
- What's the matter?
Thank you, Em.
Goodbye, Susan.
Goodbye.
I'd like to tell you a story about a guy, a girl and a bathing suit.
I saw her at every swimming meet the city ever had. Just like this one.
She was always lined up with a group of other girls...
She stood out like a swan in a bunch of mud hens.
I saw the starter take his place and call, "Swimmers up."
She hit the water and cut through it like a million-dollar yacht.
At the turn, it was neck and neck...
...but she soon pulled away, away out in front.
And that's where she belonged, out in front.
Well, she walked to her dressing room on air.
And I went right after her.
Well, she knew me and knew what I wanted...
...but the answer was still no.
I tried to convince her we could go places together, but she wasn't interested.
She didn't wanna go any place but home.
She lived in a little apartment near the college with all her trophies and her sister...
...a scatterbrained little chick who had a lot to offer...
...but couldn't seem to get anyone to take it.
I kept telling her the swimsuit business was crying for us.
With my ideas and her face and ﬁgure, we'd be a cinch.
She seemed interested, but was worried about her amateur standing.
But I felt if I kept after her,
I'd make her realize...
...there comes a time in every woman's life when she has to turn professional.
We started on a shoestring.
She was clever.
She designed and modeled her own suits.
They were new, different.
A little gag here, a little trick there.
And did they sell!
Say, she could sell anything.
The orders kept coming in and pilling up...
...and we shipped them out as fast as we could fill them.
Before you knew it, we were in big business.
-So what?
-So what?
Everybody and his brother will be there.
Not to mention LIFE and Look and the news services.
Sorry, I don't play polo.
Neither will the players when they get a load of you parading around the pool...
...in that swimming spectacle you're gonna stage.
-I'm going to stage?
-A tribute to our South American neighbors.
You're a good neighbor, aren't you?
Sounds like great publicity.
What about the club?
They're pretty conservative.
-I wonder if they'll go for it.
-They'll go for it.
As soon as you sell Mr. Cantord, the club president.
Me? Oh, now, just a minute, Joe.
You're the barker of this outfit.
I'm just the trained seal.
You balance this ball on that pretty nose of yours...
...and we'll both take a big, fat bow.
-Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go.
-Go where?
To Middlebrook, to meet the South American polo team.
Oh, Betty, get that gleam out of your eye.
You're not going.
Oh, Evie, this is my chance to meet a romantic Latin.
And a polo player is what I've always wanted.
Yes, last year, it was a football player you always wanted.
-The year before that, it was a cowboy.
-Well, l'm flexible.
You're too flexible.
Well, this time, it's the real thing.
This time it's love.
Love. Oh, Betty.
Evie, you might as well face it.
I'm madly in love.
-With whom?
-The South American polo team.
Betty, dear, you've got to stop throwing yourseIf at men.
-You're only going to get hurt.
-Not if my aim is good.
Besides, what's wrong with a woman chasing a man?
Well, it just isn't done.
Men are men and women are women, and, well, that's just the way it is.
Well, I don't wanna change it,
I just wanna get in on it.
If I don't stop dreaming of orange blossoms...
...l'm gonna have to sleep with a smudge pot at the foot of my bed.
-Are you hurt?
-No, not too bad. Just got my shoulder.
We've got a great masseur at the club.
Fix you up in no time.
Hey, Julio!
Call Jack Spratt, the masseur.
Who will be the lucky winner on tonight's Stroke of Fortune...
...the quiz show to end all quiz shows?
You don't have to guess anything, you don't have to say anything...
...and you don't have to know anything.
If you're lucky and have a telephone and can answer our call...
...you will receive $1000 and other valuable prizes...
...if you're lucky and have a telephone.
And now, the wheel is turning.
While we're waiting for the winning number, the orchestra plays.
Excuse, please, Señor, you make with the massage?
-Not now. Come back later.
-But, Señor--
You want me to lose a thousand dollars?
This is an important program.
They give away prizes.
Last week there was an old maid in Pomona...
...she won a 32-room house, a four-door sedan...
...a live-bait barge and a two weeks vacation...
...in a Tibet monastery, with all expenses paid.
Oh, but, Señor, you better come with me.
Señor O'Rourke, she hurt his arm.
Her did? Señor O'Rourke, you mean the captain of the polo team?
Well, why didn't you say so in the first place?
I wouldn't have won anything anyhow.
I listen to these quiz programs all the time. of course, they never call me.
They-- Sort of a waste of time.
Sometimes those quiz programs are not on the level.
Stop the music, stop the music!
-Long distance is ringing the winner.
-Probably some phony name.
-Mr. Jack Spratt of Clayport, California.
-Jack Spratt!
Whoever heard of anyone named Jack Spra--?
That's me! They're ringing me!
-No answer yet?
-It's locked.
-Keep trying, operator.
-Oh, the key, the key.
-Don't stop ringing!
-You'd better hurry up, Mr. Spratt.
-Well, I can't find my key!
-This is your last chance.
Oh, no, no, no!
Mr. Spratt doesn't answer?
Well, never mind, operator.
But Mr. Spratt will receive our consolation prize...
...of five crisp, new $1 bills.
Five dollars? Five dollars.
You'll never know what I went through to get all those phones.
Night after night in those phone booths.
I paid $30 for that radio, a fortune in box tops.
Wore out two pair of pants just sitting.
I lose half of my customers, and what happens?
They call me and I can't even get in, all on account of a little key.
A little key no bigger than--
Oh, no, no, no.
Oh, no, no, no.
Hey, mister.
-Where will I find the polo players?
-Oh, they are out on the polo field, I think.
Well, how do I get there?
Well, you go down this road until you come to a--
No, no, you go down this road until you come to a tree...
...and then you turn to the--
No, no.
You go down this road until you come....
Gee, I don't think you can get there from here.
Well, aren't there any polo players around here?
El capitan José O'Rourke is in the tack room, I think.
Well, how do I get to the tack room?
Well, you go down this road until you come to-- No, no, no.
-You go down this road until you come to--
-Oh, here we go again. Never mind.
Great country, South America.
You know, I've always wanted to meet one of those black-eyed Señoritas.
The Señoritas right here look muy bonitas to me.
Yeah, well, they may look that way to you...
...but whenever I meet them, they're always face-down on a table.
They only come to me to get them in shape for some other guy.
-Can you keep a secret?
-Sure.
Well, I wouldn't like this noised around, but I've never had a girl.
-No.
-See, my mother was very strict.
-Didn't have my first date till I was 24.
-Your mother wouldn't let you go out...
-...with members of the opposite sex?
-Yeah, but she wouldn't tell me...
...which ones was the opposite sex.
-I'll bet you've had plenty of girls.
-Too many.
Believe me, horses are more dependable. of course, one cannot make love to a horse.
No, unless one happens to be another horse. of course,
I don't have much choice myseIf.
You see, women don't like me, and, well, I don't like horses, so....
Well, amigo, maybe your approach is wrong.
Now, what is the first thing you do when you get a woman in your arms?
Well, I give her a salt rub.
Oh, no, no, I'm talking about love.
The first thing you do is kiss her.
Oh, no, I couldn't do that.
Oh, don't tell me you have never kissed a woman.
Well, have you ever held a woman in your arms?
Have you ever held a woman's hand?
Well, have you ever--?
Oh, amigo, you are in bad shape, aren't you?
-I don't know.
-But I will show you what to do.
First, you have a beautiful woman in your arms.
You hold her tenderly.
Oh, she's gorgeous and she's all yours.
-She is?
-Oh, yes.
-Would you mind if I held her for a while?
-Of course. Here, you take her.
You know, she's heavier than I thought.
Now, you must say to her:
-Why do l have to speak Spanish?
-Because it's a language of love.
-Women can't resist it.
-They can't?
Now, hold her tight.
No, tighter. Still tighter. Tighter.
-She's kind of big.
-All right, kiss her.
No, not like a baby, like a man.
Oh, amigo, I like you.
And you have made my arm as good as new. Well, hasta la vista.
Oh, in your language, that means "adios, amigo."
Gee, he sure looks romantic in that Groucho costume.
Gosh, anybody could get a girl if he looked like that.
What a guy.
Señor O'Rourke.
Speak to me, say something.
Oh, gee, he's unconscious.
What'll I do now?
Oh, no, I gotta give him a chance to defend himseIf.
Oh, Señor O'Rourke, I didn't know you were behind that door, honest. l wouldn't hurt a polo player for anything, especially a South American polo player.
My name is Betty Barrett.
I hope you don't think I'm bold for breaking in like this.
Gee, you're handsome.
Do you think I'm pretty?
You don't have to answer that now.
I live at the Savoy Apartments and if you're ever in the neighborhood...
...you might drop in sometime. Tonight.
Oh, Señor O'Rourke!
-Is this all right, Miss Betty?
-Oh, yes, but they like it hot.
There, that's better.
Are you sure my sister's not gonna be home this evening?
-Yes, I'm sure.
-Oh, I sure hope so.
No, I guess it'd be too obvious if I sat on his lap.
-Will there be anything else, Miss Betty?
-I wish to be alone tonight, Matilda.
You may go.
Come in.
-Oh, José, what a surprise!
-I am delightful.
What a beautiful--
It's an old native custom.
Won't you sit down?
Oh, I do not understand so good your language.
Well, sit down in your own language.
Merci, mademoiselle.
You understand Spanish good? Good.
Spanish is the beautiful language of love.
You speak it very fluently, don't you?
Tijuana.
Well, I wanna if you wanna.
My hors d'oeuvres. I prepared some of our native dishes for you.
Oh, I am delightful.
My beautiful-- Sacramento, California.
-Well, don't go away, José. “Babalu.”
-“Tico-Tico.“
Well, if Spanish does it, this ought to do it.
I made these just for you.
Oh, I am delightful. You made--
This thing,
I've lost so much weight, you know.
I made these with my own two little hands.
Oh, your little hands.
They are so.... So.... So so-so.
Gee, just like in the ads.
You are so gentle, so beautiful, so....
Tell me more.
Tell me more.
Oh, that's beautiful.
You sound so different when you speak Spanish.
You know, that's just the way
I feel about you.
And that means I want to hold you in my arms forever.
And now, please, turn over.
Oh, that's an old South American expression meaning...
...let's have some music.
Oh, that's beautiful.
Shall we dine or shall we dance?
-Well--
-Let's dance.
Oh, doesn't this music do something to you?
Gee, members of the same lodge.
Argentina, Brazil or Nicaragua?
Oh, your friend here says that he plays all the instruments.
How interesting.
Oh, nice. He has consented to do a number for us.
-I hope you don't mind.
-Mind?
Oh, he'd love it.
I'll sing too. José, come on.
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight we have a rare treat.
A countryman of mine from South America is gonna do a number for us...
...accompanied by his very charming companion here.
What would you like us to play?
Oh, yes. Go ahead.
The orchestra is yours.
Use any instrument you like.
I love those men who go:
Give me a South American drummer
And keep your butcher and your plumber
Oh, let me hear the fabulous fracas of the maracas
Give me the guy who strums the guitar
An ocho cuatro to the bar
I'll even take the yoke
From Buenos Aires musicians' local
Who does the vocal
Frere Jacques, Frere Jacques
Babalu, Babalu.
I love those men who go:
They've warned me time and again
But, oh, how I love those men
Those men
Those men
Excuse me.
I love those men who go:
But, oh, how I love those men
-Did I wake you?
-Fine time to get home.
Fine time before I got home.
Where have you been, with whom, and who said you could wear my coat?
Casa Cugat, José O'Rourke and nobody.
José O'Rourke? Not one of those
South American polo players?
Not just one of the players, the captain.
I hit the jackpot.
Betty, dear, can't you get in enough trouble here without going below the border?
Look, Betty. Now, no one wants a nice, substantial man for you more than I do...
...but these visiting firemen are strictly on a joy ride.
Now, believe me, honey...
...when you fall hard and they exit laughing, it's not going to be so tunny.
Oh, you've been out with them.
Certainly not.
But, Eve, he thinks I'm wonderful.
He says he's never met anybody like me.
That I believe.
-Betty, dear, you don't know this type.
-Yes, I do.
Tonight was just a buildup.
Next time, he'll show his teeth.
I love those men who go:
Betty, look, please.
Now, put down these animated beanbags and listen to me.
I want you to promise you won't see him again.
Nope. I got a date with him tomorrow.
I love those men who go:
Yes, I'll see that it's taken care of.
Of course. All right. All right.
-How do you do?
-How do you do?
-I received a telephone call this morning.
-Your name, please?
José O'Rourke.
Oh, yes, Mr. O'Rourke.
Miss Barrett's expecting you.
Miss Barrett? I don't believe
I've had the pleasure.
If you'd just be seated, she'll be back shortly.
She's showing some buyers through the tactory.
Oh, could I join them? You see, I've never seen a bathing suit in its natural state.
Oh, yes, of course.
-Miss Carroll.
-Yes?
-How far has the tour gotten?
-I think they're on the third floor.
Thank you. This way, Mr. O'Rourke.
-This way, please.
-Oh, yeah.
I usually make a rough sketch of a new idea...
...and then give it to our artists to retouch and refine.
The design is then put on the material...
...and the pattern is stamped by these pattern machines...
...onto this special pattern paper.
They look a little like old-tashioned piano rolls, don't they?
As you know, our bathing suits are made of silk from China...
...rubber from Malaya, wool from Australia, cotton from all over the world...
...and, of course, our own wonderful synthetic rayons made right here.
And now, if we--
If you'll step this way, please.
I'd like to show you another very interesting piece of equipment.
The spools of thread are putting together a patchwork of colors...
...which revolve into a beautiful harmony.
This strange-looking monster is knitting swimsuit material of Celanese...
...rubber yarn, Lastex and Mattletex.
Now, those in the rear are set to handle any type of material we intend to use.
We hang the pattern paper on, tie the yar--
As l was saying....
The automatic blade cuts through hundreds of thicknesses of material simultaneously.
See? And once the material is cut, it is stacked in sizes ranging from 10 to 20.
You know, any woman over size 20 should have her bathing suit made to order.
Oh, I agree.
Shall we go on to the finishing department?
And over there, the girls are sewing the very first seam.
On this shaft back here, the girls are working on the actual garment...
...sewing and finishing the neckline.
These girls are Mattletexing the waistline for perfect fit.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, you have seen the Neptune bathing suit...
...conceived, designed and created.
If you will kindly step into the salesroom, you will see it come to life.
The Riviera suit.
The Christmas package.
The Ballerina.
The Sarong.
The Scotch Mist.
The Pantywaist.
The Olympic, for the sportswoman.
And now, the Streamliner.
Lovely, Miss Barrett. Perlectly charming.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
You'll notice that the suit neither shrinks, sags nor stretches.
No, it doesn't, does it?
Would you mind telling me what company you represent?
Oh, I'm in business for myself
Would you mind turning around for me, please?
-Well, no, not at all, Mr...?
-O'Rourke. José O'Rourke.
-Did you say O'Rourke?
-Yes.
Lotus, my robe, please.
Mr. O'Rourke, would you mind stepping into my office?
-I won't keep you waiting long.
-Oh, Miss Barrett, for you, I'd wait forever.
Lotus.
Mr. O'Rourke, you're exactly what I anticipated.
You have the advantage.
I anticipated nothing like you.
You no doubt have some idea why I sent for you.
No, but I assure you I'm delighted.
Does the name Barrett mean anything to you?
No, not yet, but I have a feeling it will.
-What can I do for you, Miss Barrett?
-You can stay away from my sister.
-Your sister?
-I have plans for my sister.
Worthwhile plans.
And I don't intend to see them disrupted by a South American detour.
Oh, forgive me,
I don't understand this word “detour.“
Allow me to explain.
To detour is to take the bad road because the good road is unavailable.
But, Señorita Barrett, l am not unavailable.
And now, will you break the date with my sister?
Date? Well, l....
You have a date with her tonight.
Will you please break it?
Very well. If I must, I must.
Good. Thank you very much.
However, there is a slight condition.
I thought so. Well, how much?
Oh, it isn't money I want.
No? What do you want?
Merely that you consent to go in your sister's place.
Me? Why, you're out of your mind.
Oh, not at all, just a little lonesome after I put my horses to bed.
Mr. O'Rourke...
...your state of mind after you tuck your horses in is hardly any of my concern.
I'm sure you can find some other misguided female to take their place.
Oh, undoubtedly, but you see,
I am particularly drawn to your family.
So if I cannot go out with you, l....
You realize, of course, that this is just another form of blackmail.
Oh, Señorita Barrett, in my language, there is no such word.
If I go with you, will you promise never to see my sister again?
I promise.
Very well, it's a deal.
Oh, Señorita Barrett, your spirit of seIf-sacrifice is truly admirable.
-Where shall I pick you up?
-This address, 8:00.
-Good. Oh, do you have a car?
-Of course.
Oh, then we will go to dinner, drive along the ocean.
There'll be a moon tonight. I'm sure you can show me many points of interest.
Mr. O'Rourke, I will show you the most miserable evening of your life.
Oh, I don't think so.
Oh, there is just one more question.
How do I get this contraption off my finger?
It's very simple.
On this side, we have the oldest avocado trees in Southern Calilornia.
Over here, you will observe a small inlet known as Pirates' Cove.
Around the bend, there is--
Miss Barrett, I don't care what's around the bend, really.
You've shown me Pirates' Cove with no pirates...
...lnspiration Point with no inspiration and Lovers' Lane with no love...
...so I will take you home now.
Thank you very much.
Why are we slowing down?
And don't you tell me we're out of gas.
It's my car, remember?
Look.
Quote, “to detour is to take the bad road...
...because the good road is unavailable,“ unquote.
-Did I say that?
-Yes.
You also insinuated that l was a blackmailer...
...and several other unpleasant things.
Well, I'm sorry. But, well,
Mr. O'Rourke, please try to understand.
My sister Betty is somewhat of a problem.
She needs to find a man that's substantial and settled and, well, safe.
And I am not?
Well, are you?
No. No, I am unsubstantial, unsettled and definitely unsafe.
But not for your sister, no.
Don't worry, Miss Barrett.
I'll keep my end of the bargain.
Thank you very much, Mr. O'Rourke.
Jose, please.
Jose.
-And now if you'll take the road to the left--
-Of course.
Oh, do you mind if we stop at the stable a moment?
My best pony has been rather ill.
I would like to look in on her.
No, not at all.
I'll only be a second.
She is very beautiful in the moonlight.
Julio, tonight, I want you to play like you've never played before.
Patron, l have serenaded beautiful Señoritas...
...all over the world for you and l have never failed you.
And tonight, I won't fail you.
Oh, I'm afraid my pony's worse.
I'll have to sit up with her all night.
Oh, I'm sorry.
-Would you care for a cigarette?
-No, thank you.
-Your horses mean a great deal, don't they?
-Oh, yes, Señorita.
When they suffer, l suffer.
-What's that?
-Oh, just some of the stable boys.
They play at the drop of a sombrero.
Do you know what the music is saying? l have an idea.
I think maybe we'd better be going.
My heart beats faster, faster
Faster and faster
At the sight of you
My heart beats faster, faster
Faster than I have ever felt it do
You bring me madness, madness
Beautiful madness every little while
When you pass by
And you smile
My heart beats faster, faster
Not its own master
When I hear your voice
My heart hears music, music
Music for dancing
And it has no choice
And if I never kiss you
Tell me, what can my poor heart do?
But just beat faster and faster
Until it breaks
In two
There, that's better.
How does it feel, Linda?
Fine, unless I breathe.
Miss Felligi, we ought to have it a little lower here and a little bit higher there.
-Right.
-Eve, I've gotta talk to you.
Oh, come on in, Joe. I'll just be a moment. That's all. Thank you.
-I'll take care of the sketches, Miss Felligi.
-Yes, Miss Barrett.
-Where were you last night?
-Where were you this morning? l was getting over last night.
I spent three hours with the president of the club waiting for you.
-And you waited in the bar.
-Can I help it if he likes television?
I'm sorry, Joe.
I had something else to do.
Oh, I suppose last night wasn't important.
Well, of course it was, Joe, but, well, this was personal.
Oh, personal, eh?
Joe, lower your eyebrows. l'm strictly a career gal.
The only interest l have in men is whether or not they whistle at our bathing suits.
You know that.
Oh, now you're talking.
You know, honey, love has ruined more big business than the Sherman Antitrust law.
Unless, of course, one partner happens to be in love with the other. l have a picture of Sears falling in love with Roebuck.
That's not what I meant.
I'll pick you up at 8:00 sharp.
And this time, my little wet-foot, l'll deliver you to the president of the club personally.
Yes, master, yes.
Matilda, where's my little white coat?
Last time I saw it, it was going through that door on Miss Betty.
Oh, I see. Where was Miss Betty going when she went through the door?
To the other door.
Said she had to get out before you got in.
Well, do you know where she was going? l wouldn't fill out an affidavit, but I have an idea. l eavesdropped a phone call.
-To whom?
-A Mr. José O'Rourke.
Said she'd meet him at his apartment tonight. Alone.
Matilda, are you sure?
Sure, I'm sure. I heard it with my own two little pierced ears.
Well, that scheming, calculating....
-Miss Barrett. What an expected pleasure.
-I'll bet it is.
Well, where is she?
-Who?
-My sister Betty, of course.
-Oh, is she loose again?
-You know perfectly well she is.
Don't tell me that she isn't here, because I know she is.
-Miss Barrett, I gave you my word, I--
-Your word.
-What does your word mean?
-Oh, to me it means a great deal.
Why don't you sit down, have a nice drink and cool off, huh?
Mr. O'Rourke, I wouldn't drink with you if you were the last man on earth.
Well, what an interesting possibility.
Will you tell my sister to come out of your closet?
There is nothing in my closet except a few suits...
...one of which is minus a button.
At home, we have a skeleton.
-She's probably under the bed.
-I suggest you look.
I intend to.
You know, in my country, that practice is confined to old maids.
-Your button.
-Would you like to sew it on?
Oh, would you care for a shower?
Shirts, shorts, pajamas and miscellaneous.
Very, very funny. What about the other door, the one in the living room?
-Miss Barrett, please.
-I thought so.
-Well, one would think you didn't trust me.
-And one would be so right.
-Now, kindly step aside.
-Miss Barrett, I am a gentleman.
Step aside.
Very well. You win.
-Well, you do have a date with her?
-With your sister? No. Believe me.
Now, I will take it as an apology...
...if you sit down and have that drink with me. All right?
I'm sorry.
I'm not that sorry.
A lovely lady, soft music...
...a warm summer's evening.
You know, for an evening that started out so badly...
...it has definite possibilities.
No, no, no, before you drink, you must always say, ”Salud.”
You know, I--
-You know, on second thought--
-Yes?
-I really can't stay
-But, baby, it's cold outside
-l've got to go away
-But, baby, it's cold outside
-This evening has been
-Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice l'll hold your hands
They're just like ice
-My mother will start to worry
-Beautiful, what's your hurry?
-My father will be pacing the floor
-Listen to the fireplace roar
-So, really, I'd better scurry
-Beautiful, please don't hurry
-Well, maybe just a haIf a drink more
-Put some records on while I pour
-The neighbors might think
-But, baby, it's bad out there
-Say, what's in this drink?
-No cabs to be had out there
-I wish I knew how
-Your eyes are like stars right now
-To break the spell
-l'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
-I ought to say, ”No, no, no, sir”
-Mind if I move in closer?
-At least I'm gonna say that I tried
-What's the sense of hurting my pride?
-I really can't stay
-Oh, baby, don't hold out
-But it's cold outside
-Baby, it's cold outside
-I simply must go
-But, baby, it's cold outside
-The answer is no
-But, baby, it's cold outside
-The welcome has been
-How lucky that you dropped in
-So nice and warm
-Look out the window at that storm
-My sister will be suspicious
-Gosh, your lips look delicious
-My brother will be there at the door
-Waves upon a tropical shore
-My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
-Gosh, your lips are delicious
-Or maybe just a cigarette more
-Never such a blizzard before
-l've got to get home
-But, baby, you'd freeze out there
-Say, lend me a comb
-lt's up to your knees out there
-You've really been grand
-l thrill when you touch my hand
-But don't you see?
-How can you do this thing to me?
-There's bound to be talk tomorrow
-Think of my lifelong sorrow
-At least there will be plenty implied
-If you caught pneumonia and died
-I really can't stay
-Get over that old doubt
-But it's cold outside
-Baby, it's cold outside
-I really can't stay
-But, baby, it's cold outside
-l've got to go away
-But, baby, it's cold outside
-This evening has been
-Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice l'll hold your hands
They're just like ice
-My mother will start to worry
-Beautiful, what's your hurry?
-And Father will be pacing the floor
-Listen to the fireplace roar
-So, really, I'd better scurry
-Beautiful, please don't hurry
-Maybe just a little drink more
-Put some records on while l pour
-The neighbors might think
-But, baby, it's bad out there
-Say, what's in this drink?
-No cabs to be had out there
-I wish I knew how
-Your eyes are like stars right now
-To break the spell
-l'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
-I ought to say, ”No, no, Señor"
-Mind if I move in closer?
-At least I'm going to say that I tried
-What's the sense of hurting my pride?
-I really can't stay
-Oh, baby, don't hold out
-But it's cold outside
-Baby, it's cold outside
-You simply must go
-But, baby, it's cold outside
-The answer is no
-But, baby, it's cold outside
-The greeting has been
-You're lucky that I dropped in
-So nice and warm
-Look out the window at that storm
-Your sister will be suspicious
-Gosh, your lips look delicious
-Your brother will be there at the door
-Waves upon a tropical shore
-Your maiden aunt's mind is vicious
-Gosh, your lips are delicious
-Maybe just a cigarette more
-Never such a blizzard before
-You've got to go home
-But, baby, I'd freeze out there
-l'll lend you my comb
-lt's up to my knees out there
-You've really been grand
-l thrill when you touch my hand
-But don't you see?
-How can you do this thing to me?
-There's bound to be talk tomorrow
-Think of your lifelong sorrow
-At least there will be plenty implied
-If l caught pneumonia and died
-You really can't stay
-Get over that old doubt
-But it's cold outside
-Baby, it's cold outside
I called for Eve that night and waited a couple of hours for her.
But she never showed.
Well, it was too early to go home, so I dropped in at Cugie's.
The joint was really jumping.
I fought my way to the bar and sat down.
But this time I was smart.
This time, I stuck to the soft stuff.
Through the mirror I saw Lukie, the owner of the club, bearing down.
I'm one of the few people who like Lukie.
Maybe he deals under the table once in a while...
...but he always gave me a square shuffle.
He tried to buy me a drink, but I wasn't having any.
Then he asked me the $64 question:
Where's the mermaid tonight?
She stayed at home.
She has a little headache.
Too bad. Don't look natural to see you here without her.
Well, I'll probably drop in on the way home and see how she feels.
Well, you can save yourself a trip.
She's evidently feeling better.
-Nice-looking guy, if you like the type.
-And I don't.
Shall we?
-Do you know him?
-Only by reputation.
José O'Rourke, the famous South American polo player.
A 10-goal man.
-That's good?
-You bet it's good.
He's the whole team. Subtract him...
-...they haven't got a chance of winning.
-Winning what?
The big polo match at Middlebrook.
-Don't you read the papers?
-Only the race results.
Big game, eh? Any good bets around?
Lukie, this is a polo match, strictly society stuff.
Fifty bucks is tops in the locker room.
Fifty bucks? That's birdseed.
I bet that on traffic signals.
So this guy is the whole works, eh?
Without him, they haven't got a chance?
-What else do you know about him?
-Nothing.
Except he's dynamite with the ladies, undoubtedly out to feather his nest.
Right now, he's unfeathering mine.
You know, I never dreamed this morning
I'd hold you in my arms this evening.
The only reason
I'm in your arms this evening...
...is so my sister Betty won't be.
Oh, and all the time
I thought it was my charm.
Our song, remember?
Jose, how wonderlul to see you again.
The minute I heard the music,
I thought of you.
Remember?
Lovely thing. The music.
Jose, darling, how cute of you to have them play our song.
-Remember?
He has it played at the drop of a Señorita.
Let's sit down, shall we?
Señor O'Rourke.
-She just said that--
-I know.
“Our song. Remember?“
I'm sorry, Señor, but this is a table for two.
This was a table for two.
Mr. O'Rourke, Mr. Backett.
-Mr. Backett is a dear and old friend.
-Very old.
-I aged 10 years waiting for you.
-Joe, please, I'll explain later.
-Why should you?
-Well, Mr. Backett is my partner.
Well, it's a wonder you're not bankrupt.
Please, no.
Now, look, I happen to have a date with Miss Barrett this evening...
...and I don't want anybody to annoy her.
I had a date with Miss Barrett first, and who's annoying her?
You both are. Now, please, sit down.
-I'm sorry, Señorita, I apologize.
-Well, I don't.
And there are a few other things
I'd like to say.
Say them to me on the dance floor, then.
Come on. Excuse us, please.
What do you mean by creating such a scene?
“Creating a scene,“ she says.
She stands me up last night.
I call for her tonight, she's not there.
No message, nothing.
I come to the Casa Cugat alone, friendless.
-And sit in the bar.
-I had nothing but salted peanuts!
I wonder, worry, I grieve.
-I'm just about to call the morgue.
-Oh, Joe....
When in she comes on the arm of a professional guest.
-José is not a professional guest.
-Wait till the check comes around.
I go to your table.
I sit down like a gentleman.
This mallet-wielder insults me.
I try to delend mysell and I'm accused of creating a scene?
-Joe, please.
-Doesn't our business...
...our friendship, mean more to you than this Romeo from the Amazon?
Joe, I can explain, if you'll let me get a word in.
-He's not a Romeo, he's--
-Oh, really?
The man means absolutely nothing to me.
The reason I came out with him...
...was to keep him away from Betty, and he knows that.
She's crazy about him.
She would follow him right across the border...
...if I didn't nip this thing in the bud.
-Now, do you understand?
-Knowing your sister, I'd say maybe.
And you're not going to see him again?
-No, of course not.
-Good. Let's get out of here.
You've got a busy day at the office tomorrow.
Well, Joe, it's early yet, and I can't just walk out--
Take me home, Joe.
Get my things, would you, please?
So this will be the best game of the season.
-Now--
-Excuse me.
-Who's that?
-I don't know.
-Don't let it bother you.
-Of course not.
Know anything about polo?
-What's his first name?
-No, no, it's a game.
Very fast. Played with a mallet and a ball.
-Oh, you mean croquet.
-No, you dope.
Now, listen, and get this straight.
Go out to the Middlebrook Country Club tomorrow...
...and pick up a polo player named José O'Rourke.
-Bring him here.
-Suppose he don't wanna come?
Persuade him.
You know, boss, sometimes
I hardly know what you mean.
Hey, Julio, is José O'Rourke around?
Oh, no, Señor. He is out on the polo field.
He will be back soon, I think.
Well, I'll wait in the--
-He's pretty good, ain't he?
-Oh, that is nothing, Señor.
-Come out here, I show you a good trick.
-Really?
Hey, Gonzales.
-What's he gonna do?
-Knock the cigarette out of your mouth...
...with the whip.
-Out of whose mouth?
-Oh, do not be afraid, Señor.
He never misses. With one flip of the whip, he will cut the cigarette in half.
Yeah? I'll make it easier for him. There.
Okay, he do it with half a cigarette.
-Are you sure he can do this trick?
-Sure.
-He does it with my brother all the time.
-Yeah?
I'd like to see him do it with your brother first.
Okay. Hey, No Nose!
No Nose? I'll see you in the tack room.
Hey, Pancho, where does José O'Rourke hang out?
The tack room.
Gee, thanks, Mr. O'Rourke.
You know, that gaucho suit worked for me too.
I got a girl now. She kind of likes me too.
I hope you don't mind, but you know who she thinks I am?
-José O'Rourke?
-That's right, how did you know?
Gosh. Pardon me, we're in the midst of a conversation.
-Okay, buddy, let's go.
-Let's go where?
-Never mind, just get going.
-Here, don't push me, Mac.
-Come on, get going.
-I said, don't push me.
Now, I dare you to do it again. I dare you.
Say, you take directions nicely, don't you?
Look, I ain't got all day.
Lukie wants to see you.
Lukie? Lukie who?
Lukie Luzette, that's who.
You mean the fella, the guy, the one--?
Yeah, all three.
-Oh, what does he want with me?
-He don't tell me his business.
He said, bring in José O'Rourke.
So I'm bringing you in.
Oh, you've got the wrong fella.
I'm not José O'Rourke.
-I'm Jack Spratt.
-And I'm Little Bo Peep.
-Quit stalling.
-No, I wouldn't fool you, honest, I wouldn't.
I'm not a South American.
Look, no accent.
Now, wait a minute, now.
South Americans are always tall, dark and handsome.
-I'm a little bitty redhead.
-Oh, no, you don't.
Here, put me down.
Look, ask anybody.
They'll tell you I'm not José.
José. José, darling.
Hey, somebody who knows you.
-Oh, no. No.
-Get her in. Tell her to come in.
Oh, there you are, darling.
Guess that means we're engaged.
Oh, aren't you gonna say something?
Oh, I know. You're speechless with joy,
I can see it in your eyes.
Oh, I can hardly wait for the day when I'll be Mrs. Jo--
What's the matter? Aren't you happy about my being Mrs. Jo--?
Darling, you do want me to be Mrs. Jo--?
You keep that up, you're gonna have a slap-happy wife.
And I want you to be proud when people point us out...
...and say, “There go the newlyweds,
Mr. and Mrs. José O'Rourke.“
I'll tell Eve about it tonight.
I'd tell her now, but she's rehearsing the girls at the pool.
Oh, I forgot. My engagement ring.
I bought it today.
You'll get the bill for it tomorrow.
Well, l have to go now.
I think I go with you.
Well, come on, if you're coming.
Well, something seems to be holding me back.
What's the matter?
Is there something on your mind?
-Well, not exactly.
-Well, then I'll see you at the pool.
La traviata.
Here. Here.
So she's gonna marry you and become Mrs. Jo--
-Hey, get going.
-Okay.
Oh, pardon me, Madam.
Hey, did you see a redheaded guy go by here? Which way did he go?
-Albuquerque.
-Albuquerque.
Albuquerque?
-Well, kids, what's new?
-This is a cute little number.
All right, now, girls.
Come on, we're gonna try it again.
Betty, you put the record on and count it out, would you?
-Okay.
-Come on, gals.
Get into positions. Line up.
Get them started.
I'm gonna work out new formations...
-...before we try in the water.
-All right.
Ready, go.
Backstroke, two, three...
...four, live, six, seven, together.
Forward, two, three, four, live.
Breaststroke.
Go to position four. Tread water, right.
Up and down. Lay back.
Both, up and down. Both.
Pat, eight.
One, two, pat, two, three, slide up.
Six, seven, eight....
I wonder if José has a sister.
Three, four, five, six, seven, up, one, two, three, down.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three and turn.
One, two, three and turn.
One, two, three, four.
Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no.
Boss, I got him.
I got him locked up in there.
Good work.
I got a big wad riding on Middlebrook.
With this O'Rourke out of the running, I'm a cinch.
Why, you birdbrain. That isn't O'Rourke.
That's some stupid-looking redheaded goon.
Gee, I'm sorry, boss.
I'm sorry I made that mistake.
I hate myself.
I'll let him go and pick up the real guy.
Let him go? So he can tip off O'Rourke?
You let him out of your sight until after the game and I'll cut your throat.
This time I'll send someone with a brain.
Yeah, somebody with a brain.
That evening, on my way out of the factory,
I stopped to look in on Eve.
An old family custom. l was surprised to find her still at her drawing board...
...and a little curious to know what she was working on so late.
It was a sketch of a new swimsuit.
A very nice suit, except for one thing:
It looked exactly like a polo outfit.
-You like it?
-Frankly, no.
It's too reminiscent.
-Of a certain polo player.
-José?  
-That's ridiculous.
-Oh, ridiculous, is it?
Ever since that polo player rode into your life, you've been a different girl.
You've missed appointments, neglected your work.
We've built up something together, Eve.
Something that's pretty good.
I don't care to see it knocked flat by a gust of wind from below the border.
Joe, the business means just as much to me as it does to you.
As for José O'Rourke, l don't wanna ever see him again.
Well, now you're talking.
Maybe he did give me the idea for the suit.
So what? It's new and different.
I thought we could spring it at Middlebrook...
...when we give our water show.
Sort of a tribute to our South American neighbors.
Oh, that's my girl.
What say let's close up shop?
-How about a nice, cozy dinner?
-Nothing I'd like better, Joe.
-Pick me up in an hour, huh?
-Okay, honey.
And you forget what I said.
I should know...
...that the kind of guy who would appeal to Betty...
...couldn't get to first base with you.
Very pretty.
-What are you doing here?
-Watching you.
I came to return your gloves.
Thank you very much for the gloves.
Now, wait. Now, wait, wait a minute.
When are you going to return the things you took of mine?
-I've taken nothing of yours.
-Oh, but you have.
-My peace of mind, my every thought, my--
-Oh, José.
Please, leave me alone.
And I'd appreciate it a great deal if you'd leave my sister alone too.
-Well, are you opposed to marriage?
-Why, are you thinking of it?
Oh, yes. Very much, all the time.
-Well, that's a relief.
-I hoped it would be.
I suppose I really ought to apologize to you.
Well, it's about time.
You can hardly blame me for thinking your intentions weren't entirely honorable.
-Of course not.
-After all...
...l feel a very deep responsibility to my sister Betty.
-Well, naturally.
-But if you have marriage in mind....
Well, I guess if it's all right with Betty, it's all right with me.
Well, now that you approve of marriage and approve of me...
...there is only one thing left to clear up.
-What's that?
-It isn't Betty I want to marry. lt's you.
Me?
It's been that way from the beginning, but you wouldn't see it.
-You wouldn't listen.
-Well, José, I can't listen now.
This is impossible.
-It's all wrong.
-What's wrong about it?
-We can't do this to Betty.
-It's perfectly all right with Betty.
-Well, what about Joe?
-It will be all right with Joe too.
He'll find somebody else in the water, make a fortune with her....
Well, that only leaves you and me.
-Oh, no, José.
-Listen, I love you.
I loved you the moment I saw you.
I will always love you.
Now, are you going to get out of there, or will I have to go in after you?
No, no.
Don't come in. I'll come out.
Up to now, my relationship with Eve had been strictly business.
But I knew
I had always been in love with her...
...and tonight I decided to do something about it.
As I handed her the flowers,
I felt something was wrong.
Flowers, I brought you some flowers.
Thank you, Joe. They're beautilul.
Well, they won't be if you don't put them in water.
Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.
I'd say you were thinking, and not about flowers.
What's on your mind, honey, or would you rather not tell me?
Of course I wanna tell you, Joe, but....
Well, I just don't know how.
-If it's anything I said tonight, I'm sorry.
-Oh, no...
-...it's nothing like that.
-Then what is it?
As if I didn't know.
You sure he's the right guy for you?
-That he's sincere and honest and worthy?
-Yes, I'm very sure.
You weren't sure an hour ago.
Well, a lot can happen in an hour.
It was like a bolt of lightning.
I don't know.
I guess that's just the way it happens when it's real.
I'm very happy, Joe.
I'd like you to be happy for me.
-When's it gonna be?
-Tonight.
He isn't wasting any time, is he?
We're flying up to Yuma tonight...
...and right alter the game tomorrow, we're leaving for South America.
South America?
Well, you don't need me anymore, Joe.
The firm's well-established.
It can get along just as well without me.
You're the driving force.
I just did what you told me.
There are lots of girls coming up now.
Smarter ones, and prettier too.
Oh, Joe, I just wish it could have been you.
-That must be Betty.
-You haven't told her yet?
No, and I'm not looking forward to it either.
She hasn't had much luck with men...
...and the one man she's crazy about,
I take away from her.
Hi, sis. Hi, Joe.
Oh, I have something thrilling to tell you.
I'm so excited, I gotta sit down. l can't sit down, I'm too excited.
Your sister has something to tell you.
It may be a shock, so you better sit.
I know! You and Eve are gonna get married.
-Well, you're only half right.
-Please, Joe, let me tell her.
Oh, what is it?
Betty, dear, it's about José. l was all wrong about him--
Oh, that's wonderful. l didn't know how I was gonna tell you.
-Tell me what, dear?
-About me and José.
-What about you and José?
-We're gonna be married.
-Married?
-Yes, I'm so excited I could die.
-I don't believe it.
-I didn't believe it either, but it's true.
-Look, a ring and everything.
-It's a ring, all right.
-When did he give it to you?
-A few hours ago, when he proposed.
He's had a busy day.
Well, he wanted to get married right away...
...but I was worried about Eve, because she thought he was a heel.
We all make mistakes.
People aren't always what they seem.
-Well, Evie, then you give your consent?
-Of course she does.
She wishes you every happiness in the world, don't you, Eve?
-Of course I do, Betty.
-Well, that's wonderlul.
Then you two can stand up for me. l'm afraid we can't.
We have a lot of work at the factory.
Well, don't take it so hard, sis.
I'll still be around.
Hey, Matilda, what's for dinner? l'm starved.
Oh, no, Joe, he wouldn't dare.
-Let me go.
-No, no, this is my job.
I'll take care of it.
-Hello, darling.
-Don't you “darling“ me.
How dare you show your face around here?
-Of all the contemptible, despicable, low--
-Why, Eve, I--
I ought to slap your face, but you're not just worth the effort.
Let me in.
Let me in!
I must talk to you.
No use looking at that door, bud.
-I'd tackle you before you got hallway.
-Oh, football player, huh?
I suppose like most football players, you've got a slipped disc.
All I ever got slipped was 200 bucks before each game.
-Now, sit down.
-Look, don't get so rough.
I'm only concerned about your back.
A lot of football players have slipped discs.
-You don't have trouble with your back?
-I don't have any trouble.
Really? Even right there?
Just as I thought. You know,
I run across a lot of these cases in my work.
Yeah? What do they do?
I'd rather not tell you about it. lt'd only make you worry.
First, it throws you off to one side a few degrees.
And then a little more, a little more, a little more.
And finally you're at an angle where they just cover you up.
What do you mean? l ain't off no degrees.
You're not, huh? Get the chair.
Here, sit down and face me.
We'll make a little test right here.
Now, look me straight in the eye.
-Hey, you sitting up straight?
-Sure.
-Gee, there does seem to be a difference.
-I knew it.
Stand up.
You know, you could probably go like this for years before the final stages.
But then again, it could happen over night.
Hey, walk over to me.
-What happens in the last stages?
-Oh, I'd rather not tell you.
It's pretty horrible and, well,
I wanna remember you just as you are.
-Is there any cure?
-I could help you.
-But you haven't been nice to me.
-Is there a cure?
I don't brag, but my massages have helped hundreds.
-Would you give me a treatment?
-Oh, sure.
Get over on the table there.
Just stretch right out.
There, get up there. Every second counts.
You never know where those slipped discs might slide to next.
Here. How's that feel, huh?
See, this is much quicker.
Besides, you don't want any backtalk to me anyhow.
Here. Now we'll put a little pressure pack on here.
-How's that, huh?
-Yeah.
-That feel better?
-Yeah.
-That hurt?
-No, no.
Oh, it will.
You'll feel better when it stops hurting.
Now, we'll--
There. How does that feel, huh?
Yeah.
This is in case you walk in your sleep.
Now, for the final treatment, we'll give you a little hot poultice here.
Yes, sir. You should be done in about an hour.
Haven't been able to find out why José O'Rourke isn't in the game.
But the South Americans certainly miss him.
Well, I'm gonna go and find him.
There is the stroke, and it's over for a score.
That makes the score 2-0 for the North Americans.
Don't you understand what
I'm trying to tell you? He's been kidnapped.
José O'Rourke.
He's been kidnapped, kidnapped.
Pardon me, Señor.
Did you say kidnap?
No, but I'll try it that way.
He's been kidnapped.
Kidnap? Hey, Pedro.
-What did he say, what did he say?
-He don't know what it means too.
Oh, well--
Oh, I'd better call the police.
Hey, have either of you seen José O'Rourke?
Or do you know where he is?
Si, Señorita, José O'Rourke has been kidnapped, I think.
Kidnapped?
You mean he's been abducted?
Abducted? Hey, Pedro.
-Well, what did he say?
-He is still working on “kidnapped.“
Oh, this is awful.
I'd better go call the police.
-Hello, is this the police department?
-l have to report a kidnapping.
Hello, give me the police department.
This is the police department?
Well, look, my fiancé has been kidnapped, I mean, napped.
A description?
Well, he's about 6-feet-2, he's got red hair and brown eyes and he's....
He's here! José, darling, thank goodness you're safe.
-How'd you get away?
-I wa--
No time for explanations.
Get your polo suit.
-You gotta get out there and win the game.
-Yeah.
-Oh, no, no, no.
-What's the matter?
-Are you ill?
-Well, I've been duped.
-Duped?
-Yeah.
They filled a needle with dupe and they duped me.
You mean doped, you dope.
Did they hurt you?
Oh, it was terrible.
First, they stick me with a little needle, then they stick me with a little bigger needle.
Then with a little bigger, bigger needle.
To think you have to go out there and play polo.
Oh, I'm in no condition to ride a horse.
Why?
Where you think they stick the needles?
And there it comes out.
Bakersfield hit it, number four for North America.
Hernandez is on it, riding. They're all riding.
There's Nelson.
There goes North America, riding for another score.
That team is really galloping.
They're balanced.
They're riding as a team, believe me.
They're going along down the field.
It looks as if they're going to score.
No! No!
Sit down, son, sit down.
They're carrying Sanchez off the field.
The South Americans certainly need a miracle man today.
But where are they going to get a miracle man? Where?
-What's the matter? All right?
-The dupe.
Keep breathing. Once you stop breathing, that dupe will get you.
Now, open up your eyes.
-Now, get up on the horse.
-Where's the horse?
-In front of you.
-I thought that was you.
Come on, give him a hand.
He's been duped.
That's South American for doped.
Put your foot in his hand, not the stirrup.
That's better, yeah.
No.
Here, I'll show you how to do it.
You see?
-Now, go in there and win for us.
-Okay.
Wait a minute!
I'm not supposed to be up here, you're supposed to be. Come on.
Put your foot in the hand like that.
-Up, up. That's it.
-Here.
-No, you're on the wrong horse.
-Wait a minute. Put me down.
There must be an easier way to get on one of them.
Try it like this.
Oh, that's good, and then you....
There.
-That's good.
-Here, get in there and win for us.
You're supposed to be up there, not him.
Now, come on, over.
Here. Wait a minute.
What are you doing? l....
Put me down, will you?
Hey.
No, no, no.
-Here, that's it.
-Here.
That's it, put this foot over.
This foot over.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, I'm--
Oh, there you are.
Where did he go now?
Now, where's José?
Oh, there you are. Look.
Oh, I know. Look, you put your leg up like he did.
-Like here?
-Up here.
Like-- That's right. Now, you....
Where's my foot? Where's my leg?
Where's my leg?
No, that's not it.
You foot's coming off, your foot's coming off.
Oh, I broke my leg!
Look, this has gone far enough.
Get him on that horse.
Here, here, here.
Here, put me down.
Get back around the horse.
That's right. All right, now.
Back, boy, back, back.
Now, get in there and win.
No, wait a minute. Betty, let me explain. l can't ride, l....
Hey, you forgot your polo mallet!
-That's not a polo pony, that's a jumper.
-A jumper?
Whoa, boy, whoa!
But I don't understand.
Here, here, here.
Here's a player riding onto the field.
Look out!
What a spectacular entrance.
We can't see who it is from here. lt's number three. Yes, it is! lt's José O'Rourke.
O'Rourke? l don't get it.
How can you be there and here at the same time?
Split personality.
-Shut him up, Max.
-No, you don't, Lukie.
Well, patron, a redheaded fellow--
Yes, never mind.
How can I get to the polo field?
Grab the squad car outside.
-Come on, Julio.
-Well, Lukie...
...kidnapping isn't a very pleasant rap.
You won't need a television where you're going.
There's plenty of excitement in the game now with O'Rourke in.
Anything's liable to happen.
He's the sparkplug of his team.
O'Rourke's been hit.
He seems to be dazed.
He's lost control of his mount and is bumping into all the players.
There's the ball at the goal post.
Both teams are riding after it.
O'Rourke's got it and he scores with his cap...
...making the first score for the South Americans.
You were just wonderful in the game.
Come on.
Only two more minutes to play.
Ready for the next horse.
Oh, no.
The teams are in midfield.
O'Rourke is late for lineup again.
There goes the ball. Fordman misses.
Hernandez rides over the ball.
He's offside.
Nelson comes through.
The ball is rolling.
And a beautiful play by José O'Rourke.
He rode Nelson right off the ball, enabling Gonzales, his teammate...
...to go through to make the score for South America. That ties up--
There's very little time left in this last chukker.
You can expect some real action now.
Nobody's giving an inch.
There goes the ball down the field...
...and there goes O'Rourke galloping down the sideboard after it.
Hey! Stop!
That's my popcorn!
Hey!
There's a scramble for the ball.
Looks like O'Rourke has found it.
He's broken his mallet.
But nothing is going to stop
José O'Rourke today.
There he goes down the field, both teams chasing him.
Another beautilul shot.
They'll never catch him now.
The ball is in the clear now.
And there he goes again.
It's over for the South Americans. before I present this trophy to the victorious South American team...
...I would like to say that in all my experience...
...l've never seen such spectacular polo.
I take great pleasure in presenting this trophy...
...to the captain of the South American team, José O'Rourke.
I am proud to accept this beautiful cup on behalf of my teammates.
Wait a minute.
This cup belongs to José O'Rourke.
Señorita, I am José O'Rourke.
-You?
-Yes.
What some people won't do to get a cup.
Jose, tell this imposter who you are.
-I'm Jack Spratt.
-You see, he's the real Jack Spr--
What is a Jack Spratt?
Betty, I hope you won't hate me, but I'm the real impostor.
I'm not a polo player.
I'm not even a South American. I'm--
Well, I'm just a masseur.
Why-- You're wonderlul.
And I don't care if you are a masseur.
I like the French as well as the South Americans.
And I'd be proud to change my name from Barrett to Spratt.
-Did you say Barrett?
-Yeah.
-Do you have sister?
-Sure, Eve.
Wait a minute! l just don't believe it. I don't know whether to kiss you or kill you.
Well, kiss me.
I got two extra tickets on the plane.
We can make it a double wedding.
Oh, that's wonderlul! But where's José?
Oh, he's probably on a boat for South America by now.
-Oh, Betty.
-Eve! Oh, come on. Get ready. You're on.
-I can't. You don't understand.
-Let her get dressed.
I understand everything.
Will you get ready?
-Señor.
-What happened?
She fell for it. She thinks you're on your way to South America by now.
-Good, good.
-Joe? Joe.
Hey, you kids beat it.
Jose, hide in that cabaña right there.
I'll see what she wants.
Come on, Eve.
The ballet goes on in a few minutes.
Joe, you've got to hold it up for me.
I've got to find José and explain.
I can't let him go away feeling that--
Now, look, Eve, there are several hundred people out there waiting to see you swim.
-They're waiting to see a ballet.
-I don't care.
I'm not gonna do it.
Will you forget about José O'Rourke and Eve Barrett and think of me?
Just this once, think of me?
Oh, I'm sorry, Joe. l'm terrible sorry. l didn't mean to be so selfish.
I'll be ready in a minute.
José?
-Yes?
-It's all set.
Well, I guess this is what you call a happy ending, huh?
After all, I got the girl I wanted, she got the man she wanted and you....
Well, you got the business.
Yeah. Yeah, I sure did, didn't I?
-HeIIo.
-Why--
Well, fancy meeting you here.
Why, José! Where did you come from?
South America.
But why?
Shall we dance?
Well, that's the story of a guy, a girl and a bathing suit.
Happy ending too.
South America, take it away.
Good morning.
Sorry, Mr Murray is listening to an audition.
Will you leave a message? Thank you.
Here they come again.
Good morning. You got a lot of colour in your left cheek this morning.
- A little something to remember us by.
- That's awfully nice of you.
- Don't mention it.
- Yeah, don't.
Any chance of Mr Murray listening to the band?
Sorry, I haven't been able to get you an appointment.
Couldn't you sneak us in?
I'd like to, but Mr Murray isn't considering anything but a big-name band for Sun Valley.
(woman singing)
Hey, that's Vivian Dawn.
- Isn't she wonderful?
- Wonderful? Why, she's...
Yeah, wonderful.
♪ And a twinkle in your eye
♪ I remember, oh so clearly
I didn't know her eyes were blue.
I always figured they were kind of hazel.
Oh, get her off your mind, will you?
He's been dreaming about her for days.
That's the kind of girl I dream about.
But not the kind I get.
- ♪ So divine...

♪ It happened in Sun Valley
♪ Not so... Not so...
Stop! Stop it!
(music stops)
Jimmy, at rehearsals
I asked you not to do that.
- I'm playing it the way I arranged it.
- Well, I'll sing it the way I sing it!
Now just a minute...
- What happened?
- She didn't follow the music.
The leader crossed her up.
Who are they auditioning, the band or me?!
This band is just as...
- Miss Dawn!
- Now try to sell your band!
- Miss Dawn...
- Yes?
I think you're right. Any leader that would do that deserves to be walked out on.
- Well, thank you.
- May I help you on with your coat?
- Miss Dawn, I'm terribly sorry.
- I'm sure it wasn't intentional.
If he'd put his foot out and tripped her, it couldn't have been more deliberate.
- I beg your pardon, who are you?
- He don't know us?! How are ya?
This is Ted Scott, Phil Corey and the Dartmouth Troubadours.
- I'm their manager, Jerome K Allen.
- How do you do?
Miss Dawn, won't you continue your audition?
I wouldn't sing another note with
Jimmy Norton's band if... Not even if...
- Can you play "Sun Valley"?
- I can get a copy in ten minutes.
- What music have you?
- "The Anvil Chorus" to "Beat Me, Daddy".
Look at this. I know your style, and that's right up your alley.
Look at this. I know your style, and that's right up your alley.
I mean, it's your type.
If Mr Murray would like to continue with this band, I'm ready.
By all means, Miss Dawn.

- Thank you, Miss Dawn. Very good.
- Thank you.
I want to talk to you a minute.
That's a grand arrangement.
Who did it?
Modestly, I did. But it never sounded as well as when you sang it.
Modestly, thank you.
- Make a deal with Miss Dawn.
- And the band?
As long as we have her, we don't have to worry about a name.
(both) Thank you, Mr Murray.
Mr Murray, thank you.
You couldn't have made a better decision.
It's men like you that make this country what it is. When do we open?
Christmas Eve. But have your band at Sun Valley a week before.
Christmas Eve - that's five weeks from today.
Mr Murray, if this deal wasn't all set and you weren't entirely satisfied...
In a strictly professional way, how about a $500 advance?
You're a little short, huh?
No, money's the last thing I think of - before I go to bed.
We've been doing pretty good lately.
We're well heeled. We...
Tell you what. Carmen Miranda's closing at the Lido Terrace.
I'll book you in there until it's time to leave for Sun Valley - if Miss Dawn is agreeable.
She's agreeable.
The Persian Room at four?
Isn't that a little early?
We'd be the only ones there.
Isn't that a little early?
We'd be the only ones there.
What's wrong with that?
Nothing.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Gee, thanks, Mr Murray.
You'll never regret it.
Oh, boy, are we sitting pretty!
Have we got the world by the tail!
Honey, get yourself a Hershey bar.
With almonds.
We made it. We're all set.
We open next week at the Lido Terrace.
Cigarettes on me. Did I ever let you down?
Nifty Allen never lets you down.
Is there a Ted Scott around here?
- Why, yes. Who's calling?
- Uncle Sam.
Lido Terrace, Sun Valley and, who knows, right to the top.
- Mr Allen, will you come here a minute?
- Yeah, honey.
There's a man here to see Ted Scott.
Uncle Sam.
Glad to see you. Any relative of Teddy's is a friend of mine. Come in.
- I've had a hard job locating you fellas.
- Good timing. We just closed a big deal.
- I'm glad to hear you're working.
- You? Me too.
- I'm glad to hear you're working.
- You? Me too.
Hey, Ted, look who's here.
Your Uncle Sam.
- I haven't any Uncle Sam.
- We all have an Uncle Sam.
Did you forget to register for the draft?
It can't be income tax - we had none.
- This is for you, Mr Scott.
- A subpoena server!
If you had your life to live over again, don't do it.
- That Brooklyn dame must've believed you.
- Open it.
Here. You open it.
It's from the lmmigration Department.
They're giving you a refugee.
- A what?
- A refugee.
- A little baby.
- That publicity stunt you cooked up for us.
Almost got us ajob.
Remember the play Winchell gave it?
"Dartmouth Troubadours to adopt a little refugee tot."
- It arrives on the George Washington.
- What'll we do with it?
Don't look at me.
You signed the application.
Just because I'm the only guy that had a pen, you're not gonna shove this off on me.
Besides, we don't need publicity now.
We'll tell 'em we don't want the baby.
You can't. You're responsible - says so here.
Then we'll find it a place to live and all chip in...
Wait. What'll Winchell say?
He gave us a big build-up about sharing our laughter and tears with a little refugee.
What'll he say if he finds out we tied a can to it?
You can't keep him from knowing - not even when you're gonna have a baby.
- Figure it out.
- You figure it out.
- Didn't you tell me you wanna be a father?
- Yeah, but I wanna do it my way.
(man) Number 23.
- 23? That's us, dear.
- You wait here, honey.
- Number 23, officer.
- Right here, sir.
- Hello, sonny.
- God dag.
Welcome to America.
This is great. Nothing pulls publicity like a baby or a dog. Look at that.
Betty Jean, this is your new brother, Charles.
- Hello.
- Isn't he sweet?
- You gotta admit that's pretty cute.
- (man) Number 36.
Where's the paper? Suppose he called our number and we muffed it?
- What number did he say?
- Number 36.
Bingo!
Boys, get ready with the introduction.
Come on, you guys, get the cameras set.
(jolly tune)
- Here you are, number 36. Where is it?
- Right here.
(music falters / flat bass note)
- 36? That must be her chest measurement.
- Give me that.
I said I'd take a child, I didn't say I'd take a...
Well, she's too big for her age.
Is that your signature?
She's a refugee like the rest, and here you guarantee to take care of her and that she'll not become a public charge.
She's your responsibility now, mister.
Young lady.
She's your responsibility now, mister.
Young lady.
This gentleman is your sponsor.
- How are you?
- How do you do?
Hold it. Let's see more of your face, Scott.
- That's the way we greet friends in Norway.
- What a country! My name is Jerome K Allen.
- Come over here.
- How do you do, Mr Allen?
Number 41.
- Now let's get this straightened out...
- I have something to say to you.
I am so happy to be here.
Words cannot express how much I appreciate your kind and noble act... noble act...
I studied English in Oslo.
..your noble act of being sponsor to me, a homeless refugee.
I should always try to repay your kindness.
I thank you.
That was beautiful. You know...
- Now look, Miss...
- Karen Benson.
You didn't get your number mixed up, did you?
Number mixed? Oh, no. Why?
You see, I was expecting kind of a...
Well, sort of a... About that size.
Oh, I see. But the refugees' numbers are selected as the applications come in.
You never know who you'll get.
You got me. Don't you like me?
- It's not that...
- We're crazy about you.
We got the nursery all set, with dolls and prunes and spinach... What am I saying?
Grab her bags, Nifty. Let's get out of here.
- Did you have a nice trip over from Sweden?
- Yes. From Norway.
Pardon me. I keep forgetting.
That's the Empire State Building.
You're very young to have a wife and three children.
Where did you get that idea?
- Haven't you?
- Well, not yet.
Oh, then you're single.
Perhaps it'll be a burden to have one more mouth to feed.
No, nothing to worry about.
- Oh, then you're rich?
- Well, I wouldn't say that, but...
I'm glad you are - with so many relatives living in your house you need a lot of money.
Relatives? I haven't any relatives.
It won't be any trouble to keep house just for you and me.
- Look...
- I'm a good housekeeper.
I can cook and sew and darn socks and everything.
Would you take it easy...
(siren)
Air raid!
Air raid.
Oh.
- Is this my room?
- Yeah, but I'll have all this stuff taken out.
Oh, it's beautiful!
- Hello. How are you?
- How do you do, Mr Scott?
- Where's the little refugee?
- Well...
I am the little refugee.
- Well, you see how it is.
- I most certainly do.
And if you think I'll be a party to any such arrangement as this, you're mistaken.
- What's the matter with her?
- Nothing. Make yourself at home.
- It's going to be very pleasant for us here.
- Only one of us. I'll live upstairs.
- Why?
- Well, I...
Goodbye!
(door slams)
Look, Karen, we have to think about your future and make plans.
- I have plans made already.
- You have? What are they?
Find a man I like and get married.
Isn't that what every girl should do?
Well, sure, but what I meant was... Well, what did you do in Sweden? I mean Norway.
Look for a man.
Only I didn't find anyone I liked.
Didn't you ever think of pounding a typewriter or working in a beauty salon?
No. My father was a schoolmaster. I kept house for him. I'm a good cook, you know.
But when the war came, first I lost my father and then I lost my house.
That's too bad.
- You want me to learn beating a type...
- Skip it. Forget it.
Look, I have to run along. We're playing at the Lido Terrace downstairs. So long.
If you want anything, just... call on the phone and charge it.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- I'll see you later.
- Goodbye.
(whistles)
(♪ "In the Mood")
(sotto section)
(even quieter)
(returns to full volume)
- Oh, you were wonderful!
- Well, thanks. But how did you get in here?
I just told the man at the door I was living with you, so he brought me here. That's all.
- Anything wrong?
- No, no. Nothing.
- Have you had your dinner?
- Yes.
But I could hear you playing and I just had to see you, because I've made up my mind.
- You have?
- And nothing will ever change it.
I've found him.
- Found who?
- The man I'm going to marry.
Already? Gee, that's wonderful.
I'm sure you'll be very happy.
Oh, you will be too.
You'll make a wonderful husband.
Thanks. I'm... What?!
- It's you.
- Me? Now wait a minute...
I was sure of it when I first saw you, and just now when you played,
I knew I was right.
Listen, honey...
I said to myself, "He's been so wonderful to you. That's how you can repay him."
That's a very nice thought, but you don't have to carry it that far.
Maybe in Norway they marry to pay off the mortgage, but not here.
You get married because you want to... well, because you're in love.
I am in love.
Look, you're a very sweet kid, but you just imagine you're in love with me.
- Besides, I have a girl.
- Only one?
Only one, and I happen to be very fond of her.
- But you're not married yet.
- No, but...
Then there's time to change your mind.
- Well, hello.
- Hello, Vivian.
This is Karen Benson, who I told you about.
Miss Dawn.
- How do you do?
- I'm delighted.
I'm so glad Ted brought you down tonight.
Ted, she's much prettier than she looked in that newspaper picture of you greeting her.
- Sit down, dear.
- Thank you.
I suppose I'll be one more to ask that original question: how do you like New York?
I think I could like it very much.
Oh, she will. She hasn't had a chance to see much yet, just the ride uptown.
We'll have to do something about that.
You'll be popular with your men friends, having such an attractive sightseer in tow.
You'll be popular with your men friends, having such an attractive sightseer in tow.
- Perhaps I should go along to protect Karen.
- I don't need protection.
Oh, are you going to keep Ted all to yourself?
- Karen hasn't begun to think of such things.
- Oh, yes, I have.
Karen, you must be awfully tired. It's a long, tough trip from Sweden... I mean Norway.
- Oh, I'm not tired at all.
- I won't let him send you to bed.
She doesn't want to miss all this pretty music. Do you, Karen?
Come on, Ted, that's our cue.
When I come back, we'll really get acquainted.
Ted.
Does she know how to cook?
(knock at door)
Here you are, honey. From me to you.
Thanks, they're lovely.
Won't you come in?
How do you like America by now?
Nice town, isn't it?
(burst of rapid Norwegian)
- What happened?
- Could you get me that vase?
Why didn't you say so?
- Beautiful, ain't they?
- Have you seen Ted? Where is he?
He has to pack.
The band's pulling out of here tonight.
I'm gonna take you to meet my Aunt Rosie.
Ted is packing? Where are we going?
You're going to Weehawken to live with my Aunt Rosie.
You'll love it. She's the sweetest woman.
I'm not going with Ted?
What would you do in Sun Valley where the snow's up to your neck?
Snow? Is it like that?
Every day, except when there's a blizzard.
If it wasn't my duty, I wouldn't go.
- Ted doesn't like snow either, does he?
- Are you kiddin'? He has Eskimo blood.
He shoots around on those turned-up bed slats like they were roller skates.
And Miss Dawn, she likes to ski too?
Her? You couldn't get her near an electric icebox.
Then Ted would like me along. I'm good at skiing and skating, and he'll want company.
Honey, this is not a vacation, this is work.
Ted can't have you around with the band.
He told me to tell you that...
Oh...
- Why did he have to wish this on me?
- Why did he?
Because he can't meet an issue face to face.
You gotta look it right in the eye, right in the...
If it was up to me, you'd be on that train.
- Then why don't you take me?
- I would, but...
You're the manager, aren't you?
Making the decision is up to you.
- Yeah, but...
- You are a strong man.
If you decide to do anything, you do it, don't you?
- Usually, sure.
- If you really want to take me...
Honey, the moment I saw you with those helpless refugees,
I said to myself there's nothing you could ask that I wouldn't do.
- What time does the train leave?
But wait... It's out.
It can't be done.
Ted wouldn't stand for it. I know Ted.
That's too heavy. Take this one.
We gotta be strong. We gotta face the situation, look it right in the eye.
- I am.
- Yeah, that's what I said...
Karen, will you be reasonable?
Ted gets mad at the littlest...
I wanna tell you about my Aunt Rosie.
I'll take you to meet her when you and I come back from Sun Valley. What am I saying?
Hello, Mr Scott.
Miss Dawn, how do you do?
Mr Corey. Welcome to Sun Valley.
- What a place.
- The sleighs are right over here.
- This is going to be fun.
- First time I was ever in one of these.
- See you up at the lodge.
- OK, Mr Murray.
Say, when that coat has pups will you give me one?
Don't mind her, boss.
She meets all the trains.
I think she's been kicked in the head by a pigeon.
Come on, get me a steam-heated cab with a slow meter.
Nifty?
It's all right now, honey. You can come out.
- Have you told Ted yet?
- Not exactly. I'm waiting for the right time.
- Have you told Ted yet?
- Not exactly. I'm waiting for the right time.
Think he'll be awfully angry?
Are you kidding?
I got him just where he wants me.
This is wonderful.
Yeah, if there's enough room in this taxi cab for both of us.

Pardon me, could you spare ten cents for the Skiers' Aid Society?
- There you are.
- Thanks.
- Say, I go for you.
- You do? Haven't you got a boyfriend?
- I got 18 boyfriends.
- 18? All told?
No, one kept his mouth shut.
- Hiya, Nifty.
- Hiya, Ted.
- You happy?
- Like a kid who broke a date with the dentist.
Nothing could make you sore, huh?
Nothing could come between us?
Nothing... much.
Say, what's this build-up for?
Oh, not a thing.
What could be wrong in a place like this?
Oh, not a thing.
What could be wrong in a place like this?
What a day, what a day!
The nights ain't bad either.
This is magnificent.
Come and look at the view.
You look at it while I get dressed.
Will you come out and look at this snow?
It's as white as...
- Snow.
- Yeah.
(phone rings)
Hello?
Oh, hello, darling. I was just waiting to hear the sound of your voice.
Hey, lay off that phone and come out here, will you?
Hey, Ted?
Ted?
Could you spare ten cents for the Skiers' Aid Society?
- I just gave you ten cents.
- Oh, so you're the fella. OK.
- (knock at door)
- Come in.
- Like it?
- Like it? You look beautiful.
- Thank you.
- But are those the shoes you're wearing?
I like a tight clamp at the heel - gives better knee pressure.
Imagine that.
My skis are downstairs being waxed.
Where are yours?
Wait - you didn't really think I was going out there, sailing over the hills and dales?
Wait - you didn't really think I was going out there, sailing over the hills and dales?
- That's what you're dressed for, isn't it?
- I've never skied in my life.
But I can look the part. And if you teach me the words, I'll be able to talk a good game.
Well, you're missing a lot of fun. Come on, let me take you to the beginners' slope.
- After you get the hang of it, you'll be crazy...
- That's right, I'd be crazy.
But I don't want to spoil it for you. Go shoot the chutes. I'll find something else to do.
- You're the swellest girl I ever met.
- That's what I think of me too.
Why don't you give in?
Say yes and marry me.
Aren't you afraid we'd spoil a beautiful friendship?
There's only one way to find out.
Suppose it didn't take? Suppose I got tired of you writing arrangements for breakfast, or you couldn't stand me singing scales for lunch?
Be all right by me, as long as it was close harmony.
- Well, let's practise a little longer.
- Till when? Tomorrow?
Don't tempt me. I might surprise you and say yes when you least expect it.
Now run along and play.
- Well, I hate to...
- Yes, I know you do.
Goodbye.
OK. See you at rehearsal.
- Gee, honey, you were great.
- What happened? Where is he?
- He didn't see you. He went skiing.
- Skiing...
Hey!
Yell "track" when you wanna pass!
Hey, look where you're going!
What are you trying to do?
So you wanna play games, huh?
Well, I'll be...
That did it!
Hey, why don't you buy your own private mountain?
You should be barred off the runs!
You ought to know better than to do crazy stunts like that. Haven't you any sense?
Somebody ought to take your skis and lock 'em up.
Well? Haven't you anything to say for yourself?
I hope you're satisfied. What's the...
Hello.
How did you get here?
Didn't we have a wonderful chase?
Let's do it again.
Now just a minute...
You're a wonderful skier.
Your people must've come from Norway.
Mm-hm. By way of Dublin.
I picked it up when I was at college.
- Now suppose you...
- I learned it at kindergarten.
Will you answer my question?
How did you get here?
- Oh, that?
- Yes, that.
Well...
- Nifty didn't have anything to do with it.
- Oh, so that's it.
All he did was to tell me which train to take and lend me the money for the car fare and tell me where to hide so you wouldn't see me. That's all.
That's all. I told that guy definitely...
Do you realise the spot you've put me in?
I'm responsible for you.
Won't it be easier to be responsible for me here than in Weehawken?
Yes, but people might get the idea that...
It'd be different if you were a kid, but you're a grown girl.
- What can we do about it?
- Yeah, that's it.
You're here now and I suppose I'll have to let you stay.
But only for a few days, then you go to Nifty's aunt.
After all, I've got work to do. I can't go skiing around the hills with you. I have to...
Good night!
- What's the matter?
- I forgot about rehearsal.
I bet I'll beat you.
Take another look, Nifty.
See if he's coming.
I can't locate the guy.
I don't know where he is.
- Stall for time.
- OK.

(applause)
Boy, is she burning.
What do you mean, burning?
You could ski down the ice on her back.
Ted'll be here any minute. A guy can get lost in those mountains - they all look alike.
- You don't say.
- Sure.
In Switzerland sometimes they have to send snow hounds to find you.
Ted might not be back for days.
What am I saying?
- Who's that with him?
- I can't get over how white that snow is.
- It's Karen! How did she get here?
- Didn't you know? You took the same train.
- Hello, everybody.
- So you finally...
- Look what I found sliding down a mountain.
- Well, if it isn't Karen!
I'm sorry I'm late.
- Have a good time?
- The snow was perfect.
I'm glad you found someone to ski with so unexpectedly.
- What do you think of her following us here?
- What do you think of it?
Come and say hello.
Karen.
- Hello, Vivian.
- Hello, Karen.
- Nifty, what's the idea of all the mystery?
- What? Oh, Karen.
Well, you had so much on your mind... I just couldn't leave her back there without me.
- The great lover himself!
- So romance walked in on snow shoes, huh?
You should see her on skis.
She could give an avalanche six lengths.
Now I'll never see you, except at the piano.
You'll have to go skiing with us. Karen could teach you - she knows all the tricks.
Let's get this rehearsal over with.
Yeah, Ted, if you don't mind.
We've only been waiting a couple of hours.
But I'll bet she can't cook.
Oh...
- Come on, let's go.
- Wait a minute.
- Now what's wrong?
- Something's got hold of my foot.
- You have one ski on top of the other.
- Oh, that's right.
- Hello. I got your message and here I am.
- What message?
Aren't you glad you came?
It's a wonderful day for skiing.
- Didn't you leave word to meet you up here?
- I didn't know I was coming myself.
That's funny. The clerk at the hotel said that...
It is funny, isn't it?
I'll race you to the bottom of the lift.
- Race who?
- Both of you.
- Oh, no.
- It's only the bottom of the run.
- That's the trouble.
- Here you go.
Wait! Wait!
Help!
(yells)
Calling Dr Kildare!
Prepare for surgery!
I'm snow-blind! I'm snow-blind!
Hello, Round House?
Is Mr Scott there?
- Thank you.
- Hello, Sun Valley. Just a moment.
Hello, Trail Creek Cabin?
Is Mr Scott there?
Thank you.
Sorry, Miss Dawn, I can't locate him.
All right, thanks. Just forget it.

- You gotta teach me that pretzel dance.
- You'll have to learn it too, Vivian.
- Is there any reason why we can't eat?
- No. I'll order right away.
- Waitress.
- Yes, sir?
We'll all have a Sauerbraten mit Spatzen, cheesecake und beer. How's that?
Sounds terrible. I'll have a steak.
- And, waitress, champagne.
- Yes, ma'am.
Whose birthday is it?
In Norway we only have champagne at festivals or a wedding.
Darling, you're psychic.
I'm going to let you all in on a little secret.
I've accepted Ted's proposal.
We're getting married.
(Nifty) I'll phone Winchell right away!
No, after eight - it's cheaper.
Congratulations. Maybe now you'll get your minds back on your work.
- (Nifty) Why didn't you tip me off?
- (Vivian) We decided to make it a surprise.
After all, it's up to Vivian to say when.
I want to congratulate you too.
I wish you all the happiness in the world.
Til lykke - that means good luck.
Good luck - I hope so.
Honey, why don't you give in too?
We could have a double wedding - get a cut rate from the preacher and use the same rice.
I couldn't without Ted's permission.
He's responsible for me, you know.
Well, he won't be much longer, dear - not after you're married.
- Well, here's to us, Ted.
- To us.
- And to Karen.
- And to Phil.
- And to Nifty.
- That's sweet. And to you, honey.
Excuse me. Anyone planning to use the lift will have to be ready in 20 minutes.
- They're only running it for one trip.
- I'll get indigestion.
Don't rush. It'll take quite a while to accommodate all these people.
No, you and Phil and Nifty will have it all to yourselves.
But how will you get down?
A skier never takes a lift unless he's on a stretcher.
It's an old Norwegian tradition.
Haven't you had enough skiing for one day?
It isn't that. Everyone would think he's a svekling - that means a softie.
There you are.
We'll meet you at the lodge.
Too bad I didn't bring my skis. You and I could shoot around, do those flying jumps...
- And you would come down on a stretcher.
- Sure, I'd come down on a...
Pass the biscuits, please.
Better keep this around you.
- I'm worried about you skiing after dark.
- Oh, there's a swell moon out.
That's what I'm worried about.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
See you at the lodge, Ted.
- It's a beautiful night for skiing, isn't it?
- I'll say it is.
Ted! Will you stop a minute?
- What's the matter?
- My skis are iced up.
- Will you fix them?
- Sure.
Point your ski up.
- When are you going to get married?
- I don't know. That's up to Vivian.
Then it won't be long.
- Did you hurt yourself?
- No.
- Well, they're gone. Right to the bottom.
- I'm sorry. I slipped.
- Now what am I gonna do?
- Have the ski patrol bring up another pair?
No use giving them grief.
We'll have to use the lift.
It's stopped running.
I know. You wait in the cabin there while
I ski down and ask them to start it again.
- I guess you'll have to. But be careful.
- I will. Won't take me long.
(Karen) Ted!
- What happened?
- My knee...
The clamp on one of my skis broke and I fell.
This would happen!
Did you bang it up much?
It hurts when I walk on it, but I guess it'll be all right if I don't use it for a couple of hours.
By then the moon'll be on the other side of the mountain.
We won't be able to see our way back down the run.
Are both your skis outside?
If I made your clamps fit my shoes...
You couldn't.
Besides, one of my skis is broken.
Oh.
Well, I guess we'll have to stay here all night.
That's great. Now all we need is a blizzard to snow us in for a couple of weeks.
- Even the telephone's dead.
- Oh, that's too bad.
I guess they'll send out the ski patrol to look for us.
- They will?
- Sure.
They might have trouble finding us.
I'd better hang this lantern up.
Oh.
Ouch.
- Did you hang up that lantern?
- Mm-hm.
- Take off your shoe. Then your pants.
- My pants?!
- Roll 'em up. I'm worried about your knee.
- They're too tight.
- I'll take care of that. Which is it?
- The left one.
But you don't have to look at it.
If you just leave it alone...
My pants! What are you doing?
You can't do this!
- Pretty bad. Looks inflamed.
- Does it?
Mm-hm.
- Does it hurt when I bend it?
- No. No, no.
All it needs is a little work-out.
You can't let these things tighten up.
Nei! Nei! Nei!
It'll feel a lot better in a few minutes.
- There, how does that feel?
- Fine.
All right... Walk on it.
(groans)
- Then you're all ready to go?
- Yes.
- Why didn't they go an hour ago?
- They might've heard from them.
- I knew something like this'd happen.
- Don't worry, they're excellent skiers.
If one of them was hurt, they'd probably make for a ski hut.
There you are.
We got nothing to worry about.
Hey, suppose they have to stay in a hut all night?
Karen'd be compromised, and I'm engaged to her. Think of my position.
I am thinking, and it isn't of your position.
Get going.
This might turn into a calamity any minute.
I guess the ski patrol must be lost.
- What are you going to do?
- Fix a bed for myself.
If you think I'm sleeping outside, you're crazy.
- Oh, I didn't want you to. I'll fix a bed for you.
- I'll fix it. You fix your own.
That's close enough.
- But it'll be cold when that fire goes out.
- Here's another blanket.
Will you stop?
- I was just going to tuck you in.
- I don't want to be tucked in.
Well, don't you want to kiss me good night?
Maybe I'd better sleep outside - it's safer!
No, no. I'll go to bed.
- Good night.
- Good night!
So you think it's funny, huh?
You wouldn't have fun like this if you married... someone else.
She'll be awfully angry when we get back, won't she?
Well, if she's mad enough, she won't marry you.

Ted, do something about it. Karen, get your things - you're going back to Norway.

If my being up here has caused you trouble, I'm sorry, but it's better we sort this out, so let's be frank.
I will. There's a train out of here at 11:40 for New York, and tomorrow night, when you and your band are a sensational flop, my only regret will be that I'm not here to see it! Goodbye!
Oh!
Well, what happens now?
Let her go. Who does she think she is, telling us we're through?
And all those cracks about Karen!
We'll put on a bigger show...
Say, whose side am I on?
Don't bother me. I've got unfinished business - with the lady I'm gonna marry.

There they come!
Mr. President,
I have the honor to deliver to you the first shipment of gold from California.
Thank you, Captain.
On this auspicious occasion,
I feel compelled to say a few words.
From the soil of this great continent has come a precious metal...
Gold.
The majestic earth of this noble, fertile land, which has given us fuel for our homes in the form of coal from the great mines of Pennsylvania, food in the form of wheat, and corn, and barley.
From the plains of our western frontier...
I'm beginning to see now why you insisted
Caroline spend the weekend in the country.
I'm certain it's for her own good.
I'm certain you're certain, Martin, just as I'm certain you've overlooked the fact she'll be back in town tomorrow night for the White House reception.
What then?
Anything might happen.
It's possible the 4th Cavalry will receive its marching orders before tomorrow night.
Things happen quickly in the War Department these days.
You haven't overlooked a thing, have you?
Not a thing. Shh...

In conclusion I should like to say, our trust has always been in providence.
And time and time and again, that providence has seen fit to shower us with heavenly blessings.
The discovery of gold is merely another exemplification of those blessings.
May the good Lord grant us strength and the fortitude, the foresight and the integrity, the will and the means to exploit this new discovery for the everlasting good of mortal man.
Oh, welcome home,
Lieutenant Latham.
Hello, Alfred.
Things were kind of quiet while you were away.
Well, now that we're back, we'll see if we can't take care of it.
Any changes in the political picture?
We never heard how the elections came out.
Well, Senator McLean was defeated.
We'll be losing him next month.
That's a shame.
Lovely girl, the Senator's daughter.
Talented too.
What about Senator Frost?
- He was returned by a big plurality.
- Is that so?
Yes. Looks like we're gonna have him around for quite a spell.
That's fine.
You know, I remember when Senator Frost first come to Washington,
I said to Martha--
That's my wife.
I said, "He'll be the biggest man in the country," I said.
- Miss McLean.
- Robert.
- Caroline.
- Robert.
Please, Robert. No, not here.
You mustn't.
I imagine you'll find Washington rather dull after the west.
They tell me it's very beautiful.
It is beautiful.
Everywhere I looked you were there.
Oh, Robert...
I mean...
I mean, Lieutenant.
I want to hear all about your trip.
It must be very exciting to meet a man like Jake Carstair.
I've always been interested in the west.
It's so wild and dangerous they say.
Not half as dangerous as you in the moonlight.
The officers and their ladies are having a little celebration tomorrow night at the barracks.
I trust I may have the honor?
Oh, I'd love to, but...
But there's a reception at the White House.
Remember the balcony at the barracks the night I went away?
The President has asked me to sing.
There was no one else in the world that night, just you and I.
My father made me promise I'd attend.
That same moon will be there, waiting, and I'll be waiting too.
Hello, Father.
I as under the impression you were in the country.
I was. I went for a drive in the carriage, and suddenly I realized
I was such a short distance from Washington, I just drove in.
You remember Lieutenant Latham, of course?
Of course, very well.
How do you do, Lieutenant?
How do you do, Senator?
- And my Aunt Cissy?
- It's a pleasure to see you again, ma'am.
Congratulations, sir.
I was very happy to hear of your re-election.
I'm sure you were.
Come, Caroline.
Well, Lieutenant Latham's just been telling me all about the west.
It sounds terribly exciting.
With all the gold in California,
I'm surprised to see you back here.
All the gold is not in California, sir.
Then you plan on being stationed in Washington permanently, Lieutenant?
The plans of a soldier are quite as uncertain as those of a politician, sir.
One never knows.
I hope I shall see you again soon.
Coming, Cecelia?
Yes, Martin.
Good day, Lieutenant.
Tomorrow night.
Will you keep my place in your heart open, Robert?
The political experts say my father will be returned to office next election.
Sarcasm isn't very becoming to you, Jeannie.
You know, the first time I saw you, you were riding in the park, a beautiful white steed.
It was love at first sight.
I'm convinced now it was the horse.
For a diplomat, Martin, you certainly displayed very little tact with Lieutenant Latham.
Stop calling your father Martin.
It's disrespectful.
He loves it.
I don't believe in pretense.
I dislike Lieutenant Latham intensely.
Ha! It's obvious.
He's an opportunist.
He's interested in you solely because I'm in a position to help him further his career.
I think he's charming.
He has...
He has character.
Yes, and it's all bad.
How do you do?
I'm convinced the only reason you like him is because I don't.
How do you do?
You're the most obstinate daughter a man ever had.
She comes from a long line of obstinate people.
- Senator Frost.
- Abe.
I want you to promise me you won't see him again.
I'll promise no such thing.
Now see here, Caroline--
If you ask me, you're only rubbing her the wrong way.
The sooner you forget
Lieutenant Latham, the sooner Caroline will.
You're both wrong.
Well, anyway, with all his conniving, he hasn't been able to quite make himself welcome at the White House.
You shan't see him tomorrow night.
- Tomorrow night?
- The White House reception.
You haven't forgotten you're to sing for the president, have you?
Oh, no, no, I hadn't forgotten.
The President of the United States is expecting you to sing tonight and you're going to sing.
All right, Martin.
I'll go. I'll sing.
She's in no condition to sing, it's ridiculous.
Ridiculous?
It's fantastic.
In all the annals of medical history, no one ever heard of a cold developing so quickly.
Oh, your hand feels so cool.
Why, you are burning up.
Temperature.
She's on fire!
I better send for Dr. Carol.
Oh, no. No, I'll be all right.
You're ill, Caroline.
I just need some sleep.
Run along, both of you.
Why, I wouldn't think of leaving you in this condition.
Cissy, you go on.
Make my apologies to the president.
Nonsense.
You go, I'll stay.
No, no, no.
Please. I--
I don't want anyone to stay.
I-- I'll be much better if I'm just left alone.
Good night.
Have a good time.
Well, good night, dear.
I'll be home early.
Don't hurry.
Wonder how those got there.
I wonder.
I-- I feel much better.
But that's the way with temperatures.
They come and go quickly.
Yes. They're hot.
Yes. Uh...
Now will you please hurry and dress?
- We can't keep the president waiting.
- No, of course not.
Oh, why don't you both go ahead and I'll get dressed and take another carriage.
Fine.
Oh, by the way, don't bother stopping by the officers barracks.
Lieutenant Latham is out of town.
Oh, but that's impossible.
I saw him last ni--
His troop left at dawn.
The Secretary of War has sent them to guard the Carstair Mines of Sonora.
Well, I--
I think I'll go and fix my hair.
How could you do such a thing?
Me do such a thing?
I'm not the Secretary of War, my dear.
But you're his best friend.
- Father, I'll never forgive you for this.
- You will in time.
I'm going to marry Robert and you can't stop me.
I don't intend to sit idly by and watch my daughter throw her life away on a good for nothing rascal.
You can't just juggle people's lives around like you do in all of your silly old budget figures.
I'm old enough to know my own mind.
At least I'm old enough to know my own heart.
And I love Robert.
Oh, now, now. You--
You-- You--
You only think you do.
- But I do!
- All right! You love him.
Have it your own way.
Aw, but...
You'll get over it.
Time heals everything.
It can't. It wont.
Aw... Now, now, come, come, come.
Yes, it will.
Now, now...
You'll go away somewhere for a rest?
No!
I was just thinking last week.
Why, you can go up to New York and visit your Uncle John.
There's a new company singing at the Opera House.
You would like that.
Oh, come on now.
Tell me you would like that.
Wouldn't you?
Uh-huh.
Well, of course you would.
Now, here. Let's wipe the tears out of those pretty eyes and you go right down to the depot and buy yourself a ticket.
It would cost a great deal of money.
Well, we're not going to worry over trivialities, are we?
Here, $200 should be enough, don't you think?
Oh, it would cost a great deal more than that.
I guess it would just be too expensive.
Has money ever meant anything where my daughter's happiness was at stake?
Of course not. Huh?
You're such a sweet, understanding father.
You always know what's best for me.
You almost always get your own way too, don't you?
Well, almost.
Now, here.
You hurry up and get dressed.
Well, uh, maybe you better go ahead.
No need of us all being late.
Well, uh, all right.
- But you hurry, my dear.
- Yes, I will.
And, thank you, Father.
Oh, not at all, not at all.
Henrietta!
Henrietta!
What you up to, Miss Caroline?
- I'm gonna be married.
- Married? Tonight?
If I can catch up with him.
Have Joseph get a carriage ready.
Where you going, Miss Caroline?
I'm gonna pick that one too.
Yes, but where you going,
Miss Caroline?
- To Pittsburgh.
- Oh, Pittsburgh!
- Maybe Cincinnati.
- Oh.
- Maybe St. Louis.
- St. Louis?
- Maybe California.
- California!
Good heavens!
Just can't stand pryin'.
When a critter starts asking your name, it's getting too inquisitive.
There's a boat!
Grab a line!
Warren, will you stop twisting your hair?
Where's the baby's milk?
Uncle Harry's bringing it.
Careful now.
Look out for that cow.
Would you help me carry my--
Sorry, lady, got a load.
Would you help me carry my trunk?
I'm loaded down too, ma'am.
I wonder if you'd carry my trunk.
No chance, lady.
Keep your eyes peeled for a couple of stowaways.
I'll watch the other gangplank.
I certainly will.
Would you mind helping me with my trunk?
Would you-- Oh, never mind.
Madame. Perhaps I can be of assistance, madame.
Allow me to present myself.
My name is Prince Gregorio
Alexandrovich Strogonoski.
Uh... Oh, yes, his name is Koppa.
My full name is Kapi--
Uh, may I?
Well, it would be a great favor.
I must get ashore immediately.
Immediately, madame.
Uh, Koppa.
Carry the lady's trunk ashore, please.
Oh, surely, surely.
It's very nice of you to be so kind to me, Your Highness.
Madame, no trouble at all.
Uh, ready, madame?
Uh, Koppa, all right.
Madame.
Careful, though.
Ooh, thank you.
- Lovely trip.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.
I'm certainly grateful to you, gentlemen for helping me with my trunk.
It was a pleasure.
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
Would you mind carrying my trunk just a little further?
I'm terribly sorry--
Oh, but I have to get up there.
Please.
It's so valuable to me.
Why, it's worth its weight in gold.
Oh, with pleasure, madame.
- Delighted.
- Thank you.
- I beg your pardon.
- Mmm-hmm.
I'm looking for a Lieutenant--
I'm a lieutenant.
No, I'm looking for
Lieutenant Latham.
He's with the 4th Cavalry.
Oh, they left last night for Fort Bridger.
Oh, but they told me in St. Louis
I'd catch up with him here.
They're going to guard the Carstair holdings in California.
Yes, I know.
How can I get to Fort Bridger?
I'd be happy to escort you there, madam.
Oh, you would?
Of course, I'll have to get a three weeks furlough.
Oh, where can I get a stagecoach?
There isn't any.
Why don't you stay right here?
There's a wagon train leaving in the morning.
You might be able to arrange a ride with someone.
Be kind of rough.
Oh, I don't care if I can just get there.
- Where are the wagons?
- Down at the end of the street.
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.
Oh, thank you very much.
I think I can find them myself.
Coming, Your Highness?
Uh, yes, madame.
Surely, madame.
Koppa.
Now, my dear friend, Koppa.
We shall see if it's really worth its weight in gold.

Oh, Koppa, Koppa, this is no time to be fussy about breaking a rock.

Excuse me?
- Howdy, ma'am.
- Hello.
I'm looking for a ride to Fort Bridger.
- Fort Bridger?
- Yes.
Do you know anybody who'd take me?
I'd be glad to pay whatever is right.
Well, uh...
Let me see, uh, miss, uh...
Maybe I could arrange to take you along with us.
Just a minute, Lemuel.
If you was planning on giving this young woman a seat in this wagon, you should've thought of it 13 years ago and saved room.
My profit on the venture was $100,000.
Since then,
I've simply been living on the interest of the money.
Hold the light, please.
Mmm-hmm. Excuse me.
Thank you, my good man.
Interested in buying a wagon, lady?
Why, yes, I am.
It seems to be the only way
I'll ever get to Fort Bridger.
- Are you the owner?
- Yessum. And I don't mind saying you're lucky to find a first class outfit like this, ma'am.
Finest wagon this side of Pittsburgh.
Those horses look a little thin.
Well, to an experienced eye, ma'am, they might appear to be a little bit on the over-trained side, but you mustn't be deceived by appearances, ma'am.
There's blue blood in them steeds.
You see, they've been bred for ruggedness.
Take my word for it, ma'am, horses is just like women.
When it comes to work, it's the little, thin ones that cover the most ground.
Begging your pardon, ma'am, but there ain't nothing wrong with them that a little hay won't fix.
Well, all right.
How much is it?
Well, I'd be satisfied with $400, and $200 for the supplies, as flour, bacon, and beans, she's all ready to go.
I'll give you $500.
Well, you drive a hard bargain, ma'am, but throw in the pouch and it's a deal.
I'm going to open it.
- That's just right.
I'll... I'll be back later with a bill of sale.
Thank you very much.
Oh, Your Highness, would you put the trunk in the wagon for me, please?
Oh, wait a minute!
Koppa.
Do you know where I can get a room for the night with a bath?
Well, you won't find a room, ma'am, but there's a public bath house over on Main Street.
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it, ma'am.
And I wanna thank both of you too.
I don't know what
I would've done without you.

Has the lady with the nice singing voice come out yet?
No, I don't think so.
Thank you.
Here she comes now.
I, uh, beg your pardon, ma'am.
Yes?
I beg your pardon.
Well, you certainly can't figure men out, can you?
No. Isn't it marvelous?
I got sick and tired of it.
Well, I don't blame you.
He tried to deny it, but I said,
"If you're not drunk,
"let's see you get up off of that ground."
Warren, will you stop twisting that hair?
Stop it.
Interested in buying a wagon, lady?
Why, I just bought one.
This one.
You must be mistaken, ma'am.
This is my wagon.
- Oh, no, it isn't.
- Oh, yes, it is.
I got my papers right here.
But the man sold it to me not more than an hour ago.
I'm afraid you've been hoodwinked, ma'am.
I paid $500 for it.
That's more than
I expect to get for it myself.
Oh, how could anyone do such a thing?
I was planning to leave with the wagon train in the morning.
Oh, what am I gonna do?
You might drop over to the marshal's ma'am.
- Maybe he could help you.
- Thank you.
May I leave my luggage here?
- Yeah, sure.
- With my trunk?
Trunk?
- Howdy, Marshal.
- Howdy, Jack. What you got?
Plenty, including a warrant for some senator's daughter who's run away from home.
Well, what do you know?
Now, the Senator's headed this way by a boat.
He ought to get in some time tomorrow.
I understand there's a $5,000 reward offer.
See, I wouldn't mind bumping into her myself.
Got any idea what she looks like?
Sure, I got a full description of her right here in this bag.
Why don't you let me take you out of here?
It's much too good for you.
Four Queens.
Very pretty.
- Four Aces.
- Nothing.
- I'm cashin' in.
- I'm leavin'.
Hey, these are too small for me.
Keep 'em.
Thanks.
Whoo!
- Well, I owe you $250.
- That's right.
How about cuttin' the cards just once?
Double or nothing.
That sounds like a good idea.
After you, sir.
King.
Well, what do you know?
An Ace.
That'll be $500.
You mark a deck pretty fast for a young fellow.
Just a little bit faster than you do.
That's dollar sign, five-oh-oh.
Well, here's your $500.
Thank you very much.
My 500.
You shouldn't go around grabbing other people's money.
It isn't ladylike.
It's my money.
He swindled me out of it.
Me? Swindled you?
You sold me a wagon you didn't even own.
Do you realize that statement is libelous?
You know it's the truth.
If you people will excuse me, I--
You're not leaving here with my $500.
Why, it's practically the last cent
I had to my name.
And I need it.
I have to get to Fort Bridger.
- I'm le--
- That's very interesting,
- but if you don't mind, I'd like to--
- Now wait a minute.
I bought a wagon and paid for it and now I haven't got a wagon and something's gotta be done about it.
Please, lady, you don't have to shout.
Let's sit down and talk this thing over.
Well, we're not gonna get anywhere unless we have confidence in each other.
Then you let go of the money.
That would be overconfidence.
Well, I'll let go if you will.
That's fair enough.
Just a minute, folks.
There's something
I wanna say to you.
The last time the marshal come down here to make some arrests, the mirrors on the back bar got all busted up during the scuffle.
Now them there mirrors cost a heap of money, and they have to be hauled out here all the way from Chicago.
And that's why I'm warning you.
The marshal's on his way down here now.
He's got a whole hat full of warrants.
Five or six horse thieves, been ridin' kinda high.
Some girl who ran away from her pappy.
$5,000 reward for her return.
Then there's some other warrants for some card sharks.
It's been gettin' outta hand.
Too much double dealin'.
Then there's a few other warrants for various and sundry reasons, such as... murder, homicide, little bit of larceny...
Petty and grand.
Now I don't want nobody to think
I'm trying to thwart lawful justice.
'Cause I ain't.
All I'm trying to do is save my mirrors.
So I'm gonna turn the lights out here in the hall for a few shakes, and them that wants to get can get.
Turn 'em out, boys.
Oh, no, you don't, young lady.
Oh, I beg your pardon, ma'am. I--
All right, turn 'em on, boys.
Well, the marshal will be down here any time now.
What's going on here?
Not so fast, young lady.
You let me by.
I don't wanna tell you how to run your business, lady, but that's my 500.
But I have to get to Fort Bridger.
You said that.
Why'd you run away from your pappy?
None of your business.
Have it your own way then, so it's none of my business.
What's the matter with me?
I don't think very fast.
Are you going to give me that money?
I guess I'm just plain lucky.
I think you're just plain rude.
Here I've been trying to figure out how to get a stake to get started in California, and it's dumped right in my lap.
What are you talking about?
What the man at the saloon was talking about, the $5,000 reward.
Why--
You're really nice, aren't you?
Can you blame me?
Somebody's gonna collect the reward.
- Why shouldn't it be me?
- Because you're a crooked card shark and you can't go near the marshal's office.
That's right.
That means I'll have to have a confederate and split with her.
Do you have any friends here who'd like to get in on a good thing?
Who could I get?
How would you like to get in on a real good thing?
I'm already in on a real good thing.
I'll give you $10,000 to get me to Fort Bridger.
Let's see the money.
I'll give it to you in Fort Bridger.
Ah, who's at Fort Bridger?
Just some army officers.
Army officers don't have $10,000.
I know that.
Who's the richest man in California?
- Richest man in California?
- Mmm-hmm.
Jake Carstair, I guess.
Why?
He's the man who's going to give you the $10,000.
Is Jake Carstair your father?
- Huh-uh.
- Well, then--
- Oh, I see.
- Well, well.
Jake Carstair lives in Sonora.
What's he gonna do, meet you at Fort Bridger?
Mmm-hmm.
You do pretty well, don't you?
Where is this wagon you bought and paid for and didn't get and so on and so forth?
Oh, I, um...
Oh, it's right up there.
- Can you cook?
- Of course not.
- What are you going to do?
- No, that's fine.
2,000 miles of travel ahead of us, and I have to hook up with a gal who can't even boil water.
Oh, then you will take me to Fort Bridger.
There's just one thing.
I can tolerate horse stealing, grand larceny, murder, anything but lyin'.
If you're not telling me the truth, now's the time to say so.
You're standing on my foot.
You'll get your money, all right.
I give you my word.
- Is that the wagon?
- Yes.
Climb up on the seat.
Are we going to leave now?
The wagon train will catch up with us in the morning.
We stay here tonight, the marshal might run into us.
You wouldn't wanna disappoint old Jake Carstair would you?
No. No, of course not.
Come on then.
Would you mind giving me a hand?
Not this time.
Let's get this straight.
You hired me to drive you to Fort Bridger and that doesn't include playing nursemaid to you.
Are you always this insulting?
On this trip, everything's on a 50-50 basis.
That suits me fine.
You take of your 50,
I'll take care of mine.
Very well. Here.
Oh!
Oh, have they gone?
Yes, they've gone.
The Indians. I woke up and they're all lookin' at me.
Did you have to scare 'em?
We might wanna give the country back to them someday.
Your highness.
What do we do now?
- This is a surprise.
- Madame.
What in the world are you doing here?
Err, you see, madam.
We ah...
By a strange coincidence.
Yes, very strange coincidence.
We were just passing by your wagon.
- Back in Independence.
- Yes, Of course, back in Independence. and then we saw your valuable trunk absolutely unprotected, so...
So...
How do you do?
So, we say to ourselves...
Ah... we say...
- Eh...
- We say, Eh...
- Madam is careless.
- Yes, madam is very careless.
- We say.
- The town is full of thieves.
Ah, the town is full of strange characters.
- This trunk is apt to be stolen.
- Positively.
So, we will guard the trunk for Madam.
- No, Gregory sir?
- Yes, yes, exactly.
So we get into the wagon to guard the trunk and... imagine we... we fall asleep.
No.
Yes.
Yes, but when we wake up...
Oh, madam... When we wake up we're surrounded by Indians.
Indians!
Of course, our first thought was Madam's trunk.
Oh, it was a desperate flight... ummm... fight, yes.
Desperate, but we saved it.
- No?
- No.
- Yes.
- Yes!
How can I ever thank you?
Why, if anything had ever happened to this trunk...
I just don't know what I would have done.
So that's the-- Shh...
Well, I was careless, but thanks to you gentlemen.
Everything's all right.
- These are friends of yours?
- Yes.
And I might add, the only gentlemen I've met so far in this wild west barbarous country
Madam.
If you... gentlemen would excuse us, we'll be leaving.
Ah, with your permission, we shall accompany you to California.
Can you cook?
Sure, the last place-- Shh, shut up.
- Cook?
Me?
Of course not.
Then if you hurry you can get back to Independence before night fall.
But you'll have to walk fast.
What you mean, Independence?
Wait a minute.
I'm half owner of that wagon.
You speak for your half.
My half's full.
Hey there!
Howdy folks, you plannin' on tavelin' alone, was you?
No!
Uh, we just got an early start.
We were waiting to join your train.
Well, guess that's all right.
As long as you live up to the rules and regulations.
Who's the boss of the wagon?
I am!
Well, that is... we both are.
Married, I take it?
No!
Positively not!
Well, brother and sister?
We're no relation.
Well, that changes things considerable.
See, we don't allow no unattached females in this train.
Nobody's got time enough to assume responsibility.
- Well, I...
- I...
I guess we'll have to tell him.
On account of her family's objections, the little lady's trying to keep her marriage a secret but...
There's really nothing to worry about.
She's quite safely married to...
Ah, what did you say your name was?
Prince Gregory Stroganovsky.
You heard it.
That's her husband.
That... I mean him...
Get over there.
Everything all right,
Mrs. Stroganovsky?
How do you do, Mrs. Stroganovsky?
How do you do, Mrs. Brown?
No, no, my dear friend, Koppa.
It isn't clear to me.
It isn't.
One minute I'm single, the next minute I'm--
It's the custom of the country.
One moment you're single, the next you're not.
Yes, but nobody can prove
I'm married.
- But who wants to prove anything?
- What do you mean who wants to prove?
All I know what I hear people say is...
How do you do Mrs. Stroganovsky?
I'm Mrs. Brown.
I'm glad to meet you,
Mrs. Stroganovsky I'm Mrs...
No, no all right.
No, no wait a minute.
Your last name is Mr. Pitrowski, isn't it?
Now, now, suppose a woman you've never seen in your life says she's Mrs. Pitrowski?
It means that you're married to her eh?
- Ah ha.
- Then, why...
If a woman says she's
Mrs. Stroganovsky... then you all say she's
Mrs. Stroganovsky...
Why can't a woman say she's Mrs. Pitrowski and be Mrs. Pitrowski? Why?
Because my real name is O'Shanahan.
With a face like that?
Stay in close to the wagon!
Stay in close to the wagon, folks!
Stay close to the wagons, folks.
Did it occur to you,
Mrs. Stroganovsky?
There might be a very good reason why every one else is sticking close to the trail.
I don't remember anything in our agreement which permits you to dictate to me where I shall walk.
What a shame.
It's such a pretty dress too.
I left them simmer about an hour.
That's much too long for them.
Mr. Stroganovsky?
Mrs. Stroganovsky, how do you do?
Warren, stop twisting your hair.
Senator's daughter is single.
You sure this girl your taking me to see is marriage?
Yep, husband's some kind of count or duke or somethin'.
Well, we'll have a look at anyway.
- Excuse me!
- But, what--
I saw that you hit her!
I don't care if she's your wife or not.
I'm not gonna stand by and let you strike a poor defenseless woman!
What's going on here?
- He's beating his wife again.
- No!
- No use trying to deny it.
- Wait a minute he didn't--
Don't stand up for him.
How'd you like a little of it yourself?
- Who do you think you are?
- I'm the marshal.
- Let go of me.
- He's looking for some senator's daughter.
I don't care who he's looking for,
I'm gonna tare you up with my bare hands.
This is misunderstanding!
Please, please!
If you all go, everything will be all right.
I'm very grateful to you for what you've done for me.
Gregory... isn't such a bad husband.
He only beats me when he gets mad.
When I get mad?
Who?
The snake.
Well, then, Mrs. Stroganovsky, everything will be all right.
What did you say her name was?
- Strognanovsky.
- Princess Stroganovsky.
Well, she certainly fits the description they gave me of Senator Frost's daughter Caroline.
You sure your name is Stroganovsky?
Well, that's my married name.
Before I met the prince here.
I was just plain Maggie Murphy.
Sometimes I wish I was plain Maggie Murphy again.
Heaven knows I've tried to be a good wife.
But I know there've been times where I've aggravated him.
I'm sorry that I made him beat me.
Oh, it isn't just for myself.
Well, you see.
Pretty soon there'll be...
You know.
You poor child.
Oh, I hate to go to pieces like this.
I'm not very strong.
Guess, you better have a talk with a doctor.
Well, I used to dabble medicine when I was a young fellow.
May be I could--
Ah, no, thank you, Marshal.
We have a doctor here.
I'll carry you.
- I'm sorry to be such a bother.
- No bother at all.
Now, I've been right proud with every person in this outfit.
- That was a close call, wasn't it?
- Yes.
- I'm certainly grateful--
- Just protecting my 10000 dollars.
Your father certainly doesn't want you to get you to Fort Bridger, does he?
Oh, he just doesn't approve of my marriage.
He's probably the old fashioned type.
Thinks his daughter ought to marry a strapping young fellow and raise a family.
Of course you can't have everything can you?
What you gonna do in California?
Play cards?
Probably get married.
Oh.
What is she like?
The girl you're gonna marry?
Beautiful.
Likes to laugh and have fun.
Of course, she has a serious side too.
Someone has to have it, you know. It's an anchor.
Of course.
Kinda thought we might live on a cloud.
A cloud?
Yeah, those things up there in the sky.
I've got a lucky one.
I call it cloud number seven.
She has a cloud too, nice and fluffy.
Hers is cloud number one.
Kinda thought we might put 'em together.
You know, sorta combine clouds number one and seven.
And walk around on cloud 17 for the rest of our lives.
Gee.
- What's her name?
- Who?
Girl on the fluffy cloud.
I don't know.
I haven't met her yet.
Oh.
Guess maybe it would be all right if you put me down now, huh?
Yeah.
Guess, may be it'd be all right.
Well...
Thanks for knocking me down and everything.
That's all right. May be you can do the same for me sometime.
Bye.
See you later, Caroline.

The whole trouble is, my daughter is too cleaver for you.
She's outsmarted you.
Well, I'm going to get some action.
I'm going to handle this myself.
What time does the next stage coach leave for Fort Bridger?
It don't.
There ain't none.
Well, that's not gonna stop me.
- My compliments, sir.
- Thank you.
420, 440, 460, 480, 500 dollars.
You drive a hard bargain, Senator.
I can honestly say that outfit's worth twice what you're paying for it.
Finest wagon this side of Pittsburgh.
- Well, good luck, Senator.
- Good luck to you.
You hired me as a guide,
You told me that you had the finest wagon this side of Pittsburgh.
Oh, shut up!
There's a trail up here, that leads to Fort Bridger.
Ain't some of the folks plannin' goin' there?
Yeah, as soon as I get this chore finished I'll notify 'em.
Heh.
Warren, why do you twist your hair?
- It's fun for my fingers.
- Oh.
Go on.
I couldn't help it.
Something just came over me.
Something else is coming over you.
- Oh, you wouldn't dare.
- I wouldn't, huh?
No, please.
I'll teach you to push people into the water.
I'll be good.
Stop yelling.
A little water won't hurt you.
I didn't know.
Fort Bridger!
There's a wagon leaving for Fort Bridger!
Anybody wanting to take it, better hurry!
It's about a four hour drive.
We ought to get there before night fall if we don't dally.
Well we're camping here for the night.
Come on, Boyd.
Lets get to gettin'.
- Good bye, Mr. Bigelow.
- Good luck to you, Brown.
Glad to have you with us, Brown.
You get tired of digging potatoes in Fort Bridger.
Come on to California and dig nuggets.
Just a minute, Mr. Brown.
You got room for another passenger?
There's a lady here who'd like to ride into Fort Bridger.
- Well, I reckon we can manage.
- Who is it?
Mrs. Stroganovsky.
You bet you can come with us,
Mrs. Stroganovsky.
You're more than welcome.
And good riddance to bad rubbish I'd call it.
- Come on, I'll help you get your things.
- Johnny, don't--
Can't keep a man like
Jake Carstairs waiting.
Get the trunk and put it in the Brown's wagon.
Why... you mean the trunk...
I saw...
It's too late to argue,
Gregory Stroganovsky!
Your wife's leaving you.
Put the trunk there on the side.
Johnny.
Strange country, women marry me and leave me for no reason at all.
- Gregory let me assure you--
- Hurry up with that trunk!
Don't think it hasn't been a pleasant trip, Mrs. Stroganovsky.
Because I've enjoyed every minute of it.
- But, what about you?
- Don't just stand there.
The Brown's are waiting.
Come on, come on.
But, aren't you forgetting our agreement?
I owe you $10,000.
You give it to me when you get to California.
I may never see you again.
I'll find you. I'll take half your wagon as down payment.
- All set, Mr. Brown.
- All right.
Good bye, Mrs. Stroganovsky.
- Bye, your highness.
- Good bye.
Bye, Koppa.
Bye, Johnny.

Why did you let that fellow take away your girl from you?
- Well, he's as big as I am.
- What difference does that make?
If he tried that with me, you know what I would've done?
What?
- This.
- You would?
- Sure, then this.
- What then?
By this time I got him scared, so I give him this.
Oh!
Here and this.
You think it's hard enough?
Hard enough?
No!
Then I finish him off with this.
Ah, that's...
That's wonderful. That's wonderful.
Thanks.
If a woman is worth having, she is worth fighting for.
Not on your life.
I'm sorry, but there's nothing else leaving for California.
I beg your pardon, Ms. Frost.
Your best chance to catch Lt. Latham--
Thank you, but I've changed my mind.
I'm going back East.
That is if there's anyway I can.
In that case, I'll try and get a line on someone returning to Independence.
Thank you.
Johnny!
Johnny!
I... I couldn't help it.
I thought I could let you go, but...
I don't know what this
Jake Carstairs means to you--
Oh, Jake Carstairs doesn't mean a thing to me.
- You see, Johnny--
- I'm not very bright, am I?
Why didn't you straighten me out?
Johnny, there's something you ought to know about Jake Carstair
I don't wanna know anything about Jake Carstair.
Far as I'm concerned, he doesn't exist.
As far as I'm concerned, he never existed.
Let's go back east, Johnny.
Uh-uh. We're goin' to California.
I spotted a fancy carriage outside.
We'll be back to the wagon train in style.
Oh, we'll be great in California.
You'll have to teach me how to mark the cards and deal from the bottom of the deck and everything.
Do you mean that?
We'll get a new deck in California.

Since we missed her at Fort Bridger, where's our next chance to catch up with her?
Sonora, California would be my guess.
That's just about the end of the line.
Yes, I know that.
That's Jake Carstair's town, you know.
I used to hunt bear with Jake.
Before he struck it rich.
He didn't shoot bears, he just looked at 'em and they died of fright.
I remember one time when...
Hello?
Well, don't just stand there!
Go on!
I'll walk!
I love to walk.

So, I finally broke him with the habit of twisting his hair, all right.
That's fine.
Coming, Warren?
Coming.
This way please.
Come in.
Come in.
Coming, Your Highness?
Yeah, madame.
Koppa, Koppa.
I'll get a shave and meet you here in an hour.
How many times are you gonna shave?
All right, half hour.
Who's the man in the fancy coat?
Oh, that's Jake Carstair.
Carstair?
How's your shooting eye today, eh?
Umm...
Let her go.
All right. Hut.
How'd you like him to shoot at you?
Don't say such a thing.
Not even jest, he must be the best shot in the world.
Toss up a couple of them, Pedro.
Si.
That'll be enough for the day, Pedro.
All right, boys.
Let's all have a drink.
Caroline.
Caroline?
Don't tell me you're ready.
There's something we gotta settle right away.
I thought we could forget about him I have to get dressed. but I was wrong.
All you gotta do is tell him the truth.
Carstair's here.
Carstair?
Where?
Over there.
We'll tell him how things are.
Oh, no. I can't.
Well, I mean... Uh...
- What's wrong?
- Well, it's nothing.
- It's just that I-I...
- What?
You see, I...
I don't quite know how to say it.
What's the matter with me?
I don't think very fast.
You just don't want to hurt his feelings, do you?
- Oh, no. That isn't it, Johnny.
- You go ahead and get dressed.
I'll tell him myself.
Oh, no. No.
I-I-I'll tell him.
Umm-umm... You go get changed.
- I'll come with you.
- No. I'd rather see him alone.
Much rather. Which one--
- I mean, where did you say he is?
- Over there.
Oh, yes.
Well, I-I won't be long.
So you hurry too.
All right.
- Good luck.
- Yeah.
Mr. Carstair.
Mr. Carstair?
- Mr. Carstair.
- Yes.
Oh, are you Jake Carstair?
That's right.
Well, what can I do for you.
Well, I haven't got time to explain but you're the man
I was supposed to marry.
- What?
- Please do me a favor.
The man I'm going to marry thinks you're in love with me.
Oh, I know this doesn't make sense to you but Johnny...
He's the man I'm in love with.
He's standing right up there watching and...
Wait!
Oh. Things aren't as they used to be Jake.
I've grown up. I've found someone I love.
Oh, I-I know it's a shock to you to hear me say that but...
Well, there-there isn't anything for me to say but-but I'm sorry.
Please act hurt, will you?
How could you do such a thing?
I can't let you go.
- Caroline.
- Caroline.
I'll never let you go.
You're everything I have.
- My very life.
- Don't over do it.
Uh, one thing is not very clear to me.
Is she still Mrs. Stroganovsky?
Because if she is--
Because if she...
Where is this up-starter who's trying to take you away from me?
Probably cringing in some dark corner, ashamed to show his face.
You're wrong, Mr. Carstair.
So this is him, huh?
You mean to tell me you'd give up all the things
I could give you for-for this?
I know you're a big man,
Mr. Carstair.
You got wealth, and power.
If I thought she'd be happy with you,
I'd be all for it.
But I know she wouldn't be because she isn't in love with you.
She's in love with me.
She even told me so.
Well, I know when I've been licked.
I wish you both the best of luck.
Thank you.
Drinks for the house.
Drinks for the lovers.
Long may they wave.
Mrs. Carstair.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Carstair.
A toast.
A toast to your happiness.
And please, always keep a tiny spot in your heart for Jake Carstair who loved you but lost.
And here's to Jake Carstair, who loved me and lost but...
I'll never forget him.
Just a minute.
Oh, hello, my dear one.
Now who is it that you've loved and lost, Jake?
We were toasting this young couple.
Answer my question.
Who's the young lady?
Someone I just met.
I mean...
I'm Mrs. Carstair.
How do you do, Mrs. Carstair?
I can explain-- Don't you think you're a bit old to go about loving and losing?
Please, Mrs. Carstair, let me explain.
I've never seen your husband before in my life. I...
Johnny.
The thing which is not very clear to me is when, if you...
Johnny.
Johnny, wait a minute.
Please?
Johnny.
- Johnny, wait. I can explain.
- You lied to me.
Oh, I just wanted you to take me with you.
That's the only reason I made up the story about Carstair.
You did?
Oh, don't you know there isn't anybody else in the whole wide world but you?
Caroline.
Darling.
It's my fiancée.
Will you excuse me a moment, please?
You followed me. I knew you would.
- Robert.
- Let me look at you.
- There's something I have to tell you.
Johnny...
It's still not clear to me whether you...
Johnny.
Were you... Uh...
Please give me a chance to explain.
Caroline, what's the meaning of this?
This is the man I was coming out here to marry.
Well, go ahead and marry him then.
- Caroline, I demand an explanation.
- Later, Robert.
I'm the idiot that toted this bright young lady
3,000 miles so she could marry Jake Carstair.
Jake Carstair?
Yes. But from what I can see now, you're the one she's going to marry.
You must be the one because it certainly isn't going to be me.
You better hurry up about it before someone else races up and yells,
"Caroline, darling."
Caroline, darling.
Whoa, whoa. Hold him, hold him.
Stop him, stop him.
Are you all right?
You see what I mean?
The line forms to the right, Mister.
Are you all right, Dear?
Just a minute, Father.
Don't think for one moment that I'm running after you because I'm not.
Caroline, you'll make me the laughing stock of my whole regiment.
She will if you give her time.
Who's the old geezer?
Jake Carstair's brother?
Punch him right in the nose, Robert.
Caroline.
What's the meaning of this?
Just a minute, Father.
And one more thing, Mr. Lawlor.
Don't think you can apologize and come crawling back--
Caroline, I demand an--
I don't know who you are, young man.
But I'm on your side.
I resent that,
Oh, shut up.
Senator.
It's obvious there's been some misunderstanding.
There's no misunderstanding, Sir.
Your daughter's just a liar.
Robert, are you gonna stand for that?
I most certainly am not.
Shut up. It's really not her fault.
You see, she comes from a long line of liars.
I'm a politician.
My father was a politician.
- I remember--
- Now, wait a minute.
I've stood this just about long enough.
Caroline, what does this man mean to you?
If you expect to marry me,
I demand a full account of your conduct with him.
After all, I have a position to maintain.
Try this position.
This is too much.
All I want is peace and quiet.
No, no, no.
I wouldn't want a wife like this.
Trunk.
Trunk.
I don't mind tellin' you, brother you're gettin' the finest bell this side of Pittsburgh.

Ladies and gentlemen, this station has the honor to present...
...a weekly report on the New York scene by Alexander Woollcott, The Town Crier.
This is Woollcott speaking.
This evening, instead of reporting to you on the new plays along Broadway...
...I want to say a word about the swarm of young hopefuls...
...who arrive in New York each year...
...determined to make good on the stage if it takes a leg.
I have here over 1000 letters from such young people...
...asking what to do, where to start.
Every one of these people...
...thinks that he has more talent than 90 percent of the actors on Broadway.
Broadway. They call it
"The Great White Way."
But it shines with a radiance no electrical company can inspire.
It comes from the likes of you.
One word of advice, take what you can get.
Grab the chances as they come along.
Act in hallways, sing in doorways...
... and if you have to, dance in cellars.
Hello, everybody. How do you do?
We're gonna do a song and a dance and all for you.
Never seen a better crowd at any place.
We just wanna see you have a smile on your face.
So here comes our bag of tricks.
We turn on the show.
Drop the nickel in, Nicky, and here we go.
Hey! Hey!
New York, New York
Fascinating city
Magic castles rising in the air
Wall Street, Broadway
Guys are sittin' pretty
Every window hides a millionaire
So when defeatists holler
"There's no chance"
Just tell them this
But with a dirty glance
Once Mr. Woolworth
Didn't have a dime
And Irving Berlin
Didn't have a rhyme
And Thomas Dewey
Didn't have a crime
But anything can happen in New York
Once Rockefeller
Didn't have that oil
And Tiffany
He didn't have a pearl
And Ziegfeld
Didn't even have a girl
But anything can happen in New York
You, too, can be that big ball of fire
You, too, can have your name
In Who's Who
You, too, can climb up higher and higher
Until you reach that Rainbow Room
The Wall Street bankers
Didn't have a trust
The Automat
It didn't have a crust
The Hall Of Fame
It didn't have a bust
But even you can be one in New York
Yes, sir
You can be one in New York
You, too, can be that big ball of fire
You, too, can start from scratch
And get rich
You, too, can climb up higher and higher
Like Lord & Taylor, Bonwit Teller
Gimbel, Macy, Rockefeller
You can even be an Abercrombie Fitch
Once Mr. Morgan
Didn't have a yacht
And Joe DiMaggio
Didn't have a swat
The pot of gold
Didn't have a pot
But anything can happen in New
Don't mean innuendo
We mean only in New York
Yes, sir! Hey, hey, hey!
That's the show! Hey, hey!
Hey, that's us. Feed the little kitty, folks.
We take anything.
Hey, all the way.
Well, Nick, you got the armored car outside for us tonight?
- Boys, I've got bad news for you.
- What's the matter?
I want you to resign.
You mean, you want us to quit working here?
Oh, no, sir, Nick. We love you too much.
We wouldn't let you sit in this cellar all by yourself every night, would we?
Then I got to fire you.
- Fired?
- Why?
Look, I got the business, yes?
I got the wife, I got the three kids...
...I got myself, I got you, yes?
- Yeah.
But I only got three customers eating my spaghetti.
So, I've got to go out of business.
That's too bad, Nick.
Don't worry, Nick.
Spaghetti will come back someday.
Hey, what's this? Five bucks.
Wait a minute.
Who put this money in there?
- Five dollars?
- Yeah.
It couldn't be that icky from Waterbury, could it?
I don't get it.
She probably thought it was a buck.
I'll have to give it back to her.
Hey, you're not gonna cast that nice, fresh folding money back on the waters.
I hate to do it, fellas, but things aren't that tough.
And I better do it quick, before my stomach talks to my willpower.
Hey, wait a minute. Just let me hold it.
Goodbye, Mr. Lincoln.
Excuse me, lady, but I think you made a mistake.
- I found that in the kitty over there.
- Anything wrong with it?
- It's a 5.
- The kitty says you take anything.
You mean?
Gosh, that's an awful lot of admission just to watch us...
...when you can see the top shows on Broadway for $4.40.
I think your show is as good as some I've seen on Broadway.
You do? You do?
Oh, gosh, thanks.
We kind of think we're pretty good too.
The straw hats around here won't even listen to us...
...and the out-of-town trade very seldom gets down this way.
Where are you from?
What part of the country?
- I was born in Wisconsin, but l...
- Wisconsin?
Well, that's funny.
My mom was born in Wisconsin.
- You like New York?
- I get tired of it sometimes...
Wait til you start swinging out.
You know something?
You talk just like my mom.
She said that God made New York...
...just so that the good people would enjoy Wisconsin.
Your mother might have something there.
No place like it.
That's what I tell her in every letter.
Where else can a fellow shoot out of a firetrap like this...
...into a top spot on Broadway?
Sure, it happens every day.
Fellow comes in, sees something he likes.
Says, "That's it."
Your name goes up in lights.
- You're a hit overnight.
- Really?
- Sort of like Horatio Alger, isn't it?
- Yeah, yeah.
Only it hasn't happened to us like that yet.
The roof caved in on us tonight.
This bin's gonna close up.
But we're on the upbeat.
When we become headliners, we'll send you tickets, get your money's worth.
- You do that. I'll give you my address.
- Swell.
- There.
- Well, thank you very much.
Miss Jones from Wisconsin.
You've been darn swell to us.
If you need a couple of fellows to show you the city or anything like that...
Well, here, I'll give you one of our cards.
There you are.
Which of the Three Balls of Fire are you?
I'm the one you can't get any insurance on.
Tommy Williams.
You can phone me at Pitt-Astor Drugstore.
I'm there all the time.
It's kind of like an actors' clearing-house.
I'd like to show it to you sometime.
That's very nice, Tommy.
- I'm much obliged.
- Why, not at all.
You liked our act, didn't you?
You give a fella a lot of heart.
You know, the last person that made me feel this good was my mother.
That's a nicer compliment than I paid you.
You'll hear from me.
You just drop your hat and I'll come running.
Oh, and thanks again for this fiver.
You know, you made Santa Claus seem like a schoolboy.
It won't seem so much when you split it three ways and deduct the income tax.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hi, Tommy, Hammy.
- Hi, ladies.
- Tommy, I got that part.
- Swell, Sally.
- Wonderful.
- Great.
- Hi, sexy boy.
- Oh, hello, fellas.
- Been making the rounds?
- And how.
- Anything new?
- Yeah, did you have any luck?
I saw 14 producers, but nobody's producing.
Oh, dear. That's...
Hi, Bert. Keep those sidewalks hot enough nowadays, don't they?
- Stop looking at that 85c dinner.
- Boys, what will it be?
- Steak, medium.
- Chicken, fried.
- Squab, broiled.
- Yeah, I know.
- Three hams on rye and heavy on the ham.
- Oh, that's very funny.
- There was a call for you guys.
- Call for us?
- Yeah, the Thornton Reed office.
- Thornton Reed's office.
- Thornton Reed?
- Easy, buddy.
Don't you think it's too warm for jokes?
I don't know, but she says Thornton Reed
Productions wants you before 6:00.
How can we lose? We've been turned down by every producer.
Look here, Shorty, if this is a gag, you've seen your last banana split.
Hey, excuse me, ma'am.
This may sound crazy to you, but did you call us?
Well, who are you?
Well, we're the Three...
- Balls of Fire.
- Balls of Fire.
Right in there, please.
Well, go ahead. It's only a doorknob.
Well, hello.
But, miss, I thought that you were...
In Wisconsin?
I'm afraid not, not for 20 years.
- But, Miss Jones, l...
- Hey, you're not Jonesy?
Not the famous Jo... Holy...
Well, aren't you going to sit down?
Oh, yeah.
And I was gonna show you New York.
Maybe you will someday.
You know, I've never really seen it all.
Now, boys, to get down to business.
Mr. Reed is producing a new musical revue.
I have spoken to him about you.
- About us?
- Thornton Reed?
This is getting to be like
Alice in Wonderland.
So if you'll be at the old Amsterdam tomorrow morning at 11:00...
...I may be able to get him to watch your act.
But please, you mustn't tell a soul.
This is a very private audition.
Mr. Reed doesn't like actors.
Well, do you think you can make it?
- Make it?
- Right now, we've been there for hours.
Hello. Oh, yes, Thornton.
See you tomorrow morning at the theater.
- Thank you very much.
- Yes, Thornton.
You don't know what you've done.
What did you say, Thornton?
I mean, what did you say, Thornton?
Oh, I don't know.
I don't see any objection to Philadelphia.
Read that, please. Read that.
- Thanks very much. Goodbye.
- Bye.
Sorry. Come on.
- Hammy.
- Hiya, Jenny.
You look as if you swallowed the Academy Award.
I'm really riding.
Thornton Reed has just asked us to come over to a little audition tomorrow...
...at the old Amsterdam.
- Thornton Reed?
Listen, you better come over.
You never can tell.
- Thanks. That's one I owe you.
- But you better keep it quiet.
- Don't forget kids, 11:00 sharp.
- Thanks, Tommy.
That's all right. Shorty, remember those ham sandwiches we ordered?
Trade them in for top sirloins.
- How do you want them?
- On a plate with a lot of potatoes.
I'm not kidding. Tomorrow at the old
Amsterdam. Don't forget to tell Eddie.
Keep this under your hats, kids.
Thornton Reed's new musical, the old Amsterdam, tomorrow.
Actors working, yeah!
Wait a minute, Shorty.
That's kind of quick, isn't it?
- Pitt-Astor's super service.
- What did you do, send out for it?
This is what I've been telling you fellas about, eating acting.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
What's that?
Excuse me, I'll be back in a minute.
- Hey, you can't do that.
- Go away.
- What are you crying about?
- None of your business.
All right, come on, come on, break it up.
You've gotten your laugh.
I don't think I like you.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Now that we know each other...
- But we don't.
My name is Williams, Tommy Williams.
What's yours?
It doesn't matter. I'm just a failure.
Oh, well, I was a failure yesterday.
Now look at me today.
You mean, you even looked worse yesterday?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.
But I was a success yesterday.
You mean, you even looked better yesterday?
Oh, I worked and I slaved.
There were only three words in the part, but, oh, they were such beautiful words.
"I love you"?
No.
"The telephone, madam."
I never got past "the telephone."
I just haven't got any talent.
Well, you cry awfully pretty.
- You think so?
- Yeah, no question.
And I wouldn't worry about three tired little words.
You have talent.
Why, you're steaming with it.
It's coming out all over you.
And don't say you can't act, because you can act.
You're not unhappy, you're only making yourself believe you are.
And that's acting.
And that's why it's wonderful.
You mean I don't really feel badly at all?
Oh, of course, you do.
Of course, you do. Excuse me.
But those are 14-karat tears and you don't wanna waste them...
...because someday, they'll come in awfully handy at the curtain of the second act.
But don't you have to feel better to be able...?
Sure you do, but you don't want to let them touch you.
Why, I'll bet right at this minute you have more talent than Katharine Cornell.
I'll bet at this minute
I've got more talent than Barrymore.
That's what you've got to keep dreaming and thinking.
And when things get so bad that you just wanna holler murder...
...that's when you sell yourself a bill of goods.
And if you can do it then, you can sell anybody.
I guess I'm getting to be quite a speechmaker.
You know, you don't talk like an actor at all.
Oh, but I act like one.
You're through with that?
- Oh, yeah, here.
- Thanks.
Well, now that I've straightened your life out, what's your name?
- Penny.
- Penny, just like that?
- No puns.
- All right, one-cent.
- Where do you live?
- I live down that way.
- Would a nickel swing it?
- No, but two might.
All right, I'm declaring myself a partner.
- Come on.
- All right.
- Hey, where you going?
- I'm gonna fly this little sparrow home.
Well, stay out of the stratosphere,
Cock Robin. We've got an act to rehearse.
- You live far from the subway?
- I practically live in it.
- Hiya, Mary.
- Hello, Penny.
- Hello, Johnny. How's your mother?
- Much better.
- Thanks for the cake.
- Okay.
Well, here we are.
- How are you on steps?
- Terrific.
Hello, Papa. Papa.
Oh, hello, dear. Oh, hello, hello.
- Papa, this is Mr. Williams.
- How do you do?
- How do you do? I hope we didn't interrupt.
- No, not at all.
Barbara Jo is late again.
Penny, if she comes, you tell her she's a bad girl.
You know, every time I have an orchestra rehearsal for those children, why, I'm late.
- Goodbye, young man. Glad to know you.
- Bye-bye, sir.
- Oh, my.
- I hope I didn't drive him out.
He was just afraid I was gonna ask him if he collected from Mrs. Mulligan.
He just won't ask for money.
Boy, I'll bet this piano has played a lot of empty stomach music.
Yeah. Would you like a piece of cake?
- Cake? Did you bake it?
- No, but I bought it.
- Oh, bring it on then.
- All right.
Where's Papa Morris? I'm late.
Well, excuse me.
Are you taking a lesson?
No, no, I'm just tuning the piano.
You mean I won't be able to take a lesson?
You certainly won't. Where've you been?
This is the third time in a row...
- It's wonderful, wait till you hear.
- What?
They got the thing passed.
We're all going to the country.
Two weeks, for free.
Isn't that marvelous?
- All the kids?
- The whole settlement house.
Mr. Stone just told me.
And I'm president of the whole thing.
- Congratulations.
- This is Barbara Jo. This is Mr. Williams.
- Pleased to meet you, Mr. Williams.
- Mr. Williams is an actor, you know.
- A real actor? On the stage?
- Well, I...
Here's your cake. Here, Barbara Jo.
Gee, you don't look like an actor.
That's what most of the producers think.
- Won't you sit down, Mr. Williams?
- Thank you.
You know, Mr. Williams, there's a couple of things I don't understand about acting.
Only a couple of things?
When you're on the stage...
...you have your arms around the girl and say:
"I love you more than anything in the whole world."
- Yeah?
- Do you really mean it?
Well, that depends upon the girl.
Yeah, I suppose so.
But, gee, when Robert Taylor says it, he makes me believe it.
You know, Penny's gonna be an actress.
She's always acting.
- Eat your cake, darling.
- Well, I am eating it.
Oh, well, got to be going.
Big meeting tonight.
Wait until the kids find out they're really going.
Some of them never even seen the country.
- Tell Papa I couldn't help it.
- I'll tell him, but you better practice.
Why, Penny, you know I love to practice.
Goodbye, Mr. Williams.
Sure like to see you act sometime.
Well, thank you.
Bye, Penny.
- Won't you sit?
- Won't you sit?
Here we are, just as if we had planned it.
Yeah, you mean just as if we didn't.
You know, I have a feeling that you're gonna be that unknown quantity in my life.
What's that?
Something that brings a fellow good luck.
The springboard. The inspiration.
The thing that everything adds up to.
Gee, that's quite an assignment.
Not with what you have.
Just what have I, Mr. Williams?
Well, it's a combination.
A combination of something sweet and warm.
Plus a quality that's far away from everybody.
Reflection of talent, that's what it is.
There's something special lighting everything around you.
- I didn't know I had that.
- Sure, that's what you have.
And as soon as I see
Thornton tomorrow...
...why, I'm gonna tell him to take a good look at you.
Before you know it, we'll be dancing on top of the world, together.
Oh, gee, that would be fun, if it ever came true.
As soon as I get through with the audition...
...why, I'll come back over here and you'll see how true it is.
Well, just so you won't get lost.
I'll be at the settlement house filing envelopes.
And you can park your dream boat right outside the entrance.
- Now, will you do something for me?
- Lf I can.
- Will you sing me a song?
- How do you know I can?
Because you sing when you talk, when you walk.
Why, you're eyes are...
Why, they're singing right now.
They are?
Well, I'll be darned.
When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare
I like New York in June
How about you?
I like a Gershwin tune
How about you?
I love a fireside
When a storm is due
I like potato chips
Moonlight and motor trips
How about you?
I'm mad about good books
Can't get my fill
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks
Give me a thrill
Holding hands in the movie show
When all the lights are low
May not be new
But I like it
How about you?
I like Jack Benny's jokes
To a degree
I love the common folks
That includes me
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue
I like banana splits
Late supper at the Ritz
How about you?
I love to dream of fame
Maybe I'll shine
I'd love to see your name
Right beside mine
I can see we're in harmony
Looks like we both agree
On what to do
- And I like it
- And I like it
- How about you?
- How about you?
I'm so delighted
I've ignited the spark within you
Let me continue to make it burn
With you, I will be like a Trilby
So let's not dally
Come on, Svengali
I've lots to learn
When you're arising
Start exercising daily
For example
Just a sample
Bend and touch the floor
Fifty times or more
A fine start
To be a Bernhardt
A dictionary's necessary
But not for talking
It's used for walking
The Ziegfeld way
Is this okay?
That's the trick
You're catching on quickly
Should I take a bow?
Oh, let me show you how
- Just like partners on the stage
- Yeah.
If you can use a partner
I'm the right age
Hey, don't go under there.
The way our luck's been running,
I wish it was Friday the 13th.
- Oh, no, you don't.
- Wait a minute, what's the idea?
- This happens to be Friday.
- And the 13th.
It is?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Strange. Well, here we are.
Remember, this Thornton Reed is big-league.
This is a private audition.
No mugging, no pressing.
- Don't look anxious.
- All right.
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!
Look's like somebody's been reading our mail.
Easy, folks. Easy, folks. Do you realize you're getting on Mr. Reed's nerves?
Mason, where's the boy with my sandwich?
He'll be here.
I think he got lost in the crowd.
- I can't even get a 10c sandwich.
- Thornton, remember your headache.
Don't rub me down.
You're the cause of all this.
You and your discoveries.
I don't want to discover anyone.
I give you my word.
This time, I only told three boys.
Where, in Yankee Stadium?
This is wonderful.
Every actor in New York will love you.
I don't want every actor in New York to love me. I want my wife to love me.
- Drink this.
- I don't want it, I want my sandwich. I'm...
Mason, you've got to keep them back.
- Please, please, please.
- I'm keeping them back.
People, you must stop this nonsense.
All I'm doing is a little intimate musical, not the Passion play.
- Quiet, quiet, quiet!
- Listen, we want to give everyone a chance.
But unless you line up so I can see you,
I'll have to call the whole thing off.
- Come on, Jenny. Let's get in.
- Get in, Helen.
- Quit shoving back there, you pig.
- What's the big idea?
Mr. Reed, you don't know us, but we just closed the Tip-Top Inn in Albany.
Yeah, we're the Four Hot Licks.
- May...
- Ray...
- Fay...
- And Kay.
Oh, sextet from Madam Lucia
Oh, sextet
I love you, yeah
Please, please, some other time.
Mason, have them pass by in one line so we could get through with this.
Mr. Reed will see you.
- Keep in one line, keep moving.
- No, I'm sorry.
- Make it snappy.
- Yes, I could use you.
- Yes, no, too small.
- Just keep on going.
- No, too short. No, boys.
- No.
- What do you mean, no?
- But, Thornton...
- I mean no, I can't use you.
- Well, how do you know?
- How do l...?
- You haven't seen us do anything.
We're the Three Balls of Fire.
Once we get started, you can't put us out.
But I can put you out before you get started. Mason.
Thornton, wait. These are the boys I've been telling you about. They're tremendous.
In three years, they'll be greater than Astaire.
Then bring them back in three years.
I'm sorry, lad, some other time.
- Not now, that's all. I'm sorry.
- Mr. Reed, l...
All right, keep them going.
- Just keep on going.
- No, no, no, I'm sorry.
No, I can't use you.
No, no children. No, no children.
Wait, wait, don't send my brother to the chair.
Don't let him burn.
Please, please, warden, please.
Mr. Reed, I have some clippings here.
This is Maxine when she was a little girl...
Mason, Mason.
Maybe we ought to change our name to the Three Puffs of Smoke.
Private audition.
How do you like her, giving us that?
It's not her fault.
It's those producers. They're all the same.
Just send out nonchalantly for 1000 actors every time they get lonesome.
Well, I guess we're cooked, fellas.
Yep, on both sides.
What do we do now, Tom?
I've been pedaling that hocus-pocus about talent and ambition.
They don't want talent. They wouldn't know talent if it was wrapped up in the mailbox.
I guess it's back to the bulrushes.
Maybe I don't belong in show business.
I don't know.
It's all right, I'll do something else. Drive a truck, dig ditches, sell shoes, anything.
Take it easy, Tommy.
You know you're not serious.
We'll be back making the rounds again tomorrow.
- Something will turn up.
- Not me, brother.
What are you trying to do, split up the axis?
How long you gonna go through life singing?
How long are you gonna keep yourself in hock to producers?
Until you become a producer yourself.
Until you become a producer yourself.
That's very funny.
Until you become a producer yourself.
Sure. Why not?
There's nothing magic to it.
All you need is a little courage, taste, money.
Yeah, and we're loaded with courage and taste.
We've got lots of talent.
So why don't we sign ourselves up?
Four months ago, when we came to this city, we devoted our lives to the theater.
Here comes the Gettysburg Address.
We got the brush from the New York producers.
Living or dead.
We've got a satchel full of talent and no place to display it.
So we'll build our own showcase.
- Have you forgotten about money?
- Or are you planning to win a raffle?
Money? Well, anybody can put on a show with money.
Let's not be corny about this thing.
Oh, certainly, can't be corny, so let's forget about money.
What do we use instead?
Well, anything. We can use...
Well, you know... like a... a cause.
- A what?
- A what?
A cause.
A great, big beautiful cause.
Something that'll tug at their heartstrings...
...make them dig down in their jeans and bring tears to their eyes.
You better stop eating that salami.
Don't you realize that America is cause-crazy?
Why, they give shows for everybody.
China, the Red Cross, Bundles for Britain.
There must be some place they haven't thought of.
Right here.
Now you're talking.
How about a cause for eatless actors?
Actors? No, nobody cares about actors.
It's gotta be something solid.
- Like widows, orphans, dogs.
- How about mailmen or motormen?
- No, no, glamour.
- How about ball players?
They've all got chicken farms.
- Hey, I got it. I got it.
- Well, what is it?
How about chorus girls?
Well, how about them?
I'm sorry, Hammy.
I guess I'm just blowing bubbles again.
If only I hadn't written that big buildup to Mom...
...promised the city hall to everybody.
Hey, where are you going?
I'm gonna get a little air. I'm a little flat.
What's your claim?
Look, look, things can't be as bad as all that.
You don't know what happened.
Something awful happened to me, but I'm not crying, look.
You're a boy.
You know, you cry awfully pretty.
- I do?
- Sure, you cry beautifully.
Why, if I thought I looked that pretty,
I'd be crying my eyes out all the time.
You know what?
I'm gonna make you my official crier.
Well, and as soon as things get tough...
...why, I'll give you the signal and you can turn it on.
Why, everybody can cry if they're unhappy themselves.
It's not me so much. I've seen it.
But some of the other kids, they never even been there.
- And those old trustees...
- The who?
The Board of Trustees.
They promised we were going to the country for two whole weeks.
And now they tell us they can't give us the money.
Well, don't you worry about it.
You're still young.
You have lots of time to go to the...
Hey, what did you say?
We were gonna see cows and brooks and milk them and everything.
You mean, they backed out on you?
Why, I've never heard of such a thing.
Why, how dare they do that?
- Come on, we'll go see about it right now.
- See about what?
These kids have never seen the sunlight, babbling brooks, blade of grass...
...a bluebird flitting from tree to tree.
What has happened to the milk of human kindness? Where is he?
- Where's who?
- The whatchamacallit, the number one guy.
- The superintendent? He's inside.
- That's our man.
Why, the idea of these people, these children...
So all you have to do is give us the word and we're ready to go.
I like your enthusiasm.
I'm afraid it's a much bigger job than you imagine.
No, it isn't.
You see, Tommy's a professional.
Yes, I know, but where are you going to get all the talent?
Talent?
Why, the world is riddled with talent.
You can shake it out of trees.
It's right here.
This girl right here, she's the greatest singer of songs I ever heard.
You've got the greatest crying act in show business.
And as for myself, well...
And if that isn't enough, I can walk into a drugstore on 44th street...
...throw a rock, hit more talent than on any Broadway show.
Well, that takes care of the talent.
Now, where do you propose putting this show on?
In the auditorium?
They couldn't seat over
100 people there.
No, this has gotta be big.
This isn't gonna be any amateur night.
It's gotta be gigantic.
Like the World Series or the Aquacade.
This is Rose Bowl stuff.
Why, it looks as if you'll need a whole city block.
Yeah.
City block. Yeah. Sure, that's it.
Right in the neighborhood.
We'll rope it off.
Everybody will come to it.
We give them a sample, then pass the hat.
With the money we take, we'll hire the hall.
Put on a show for half a buck that'll send those kids to the country.
Well, I must admit you have a wonderful platform.
- Couldn't we, Mr. Stone?
- Please, please?
Well, in the face of all this enthusiasm, what can I say?
But I'm not guaranteeing that Mr. Busch will be swept off his feet.
Mr. Busch? Who's Mr. Busch?
The district leader. He's the only one who can give you a permit for a block party.
- Tough customer?
- A very tough customer.
Come on, we'll go there, see if we can cut him down to our size. Bye.
- Thank you.
- That's quite all right.
So here's this character sitting there,
Simon J. Busch.
Typical ward heeler.
Heater sticking out the side of his mouth, big black derby with heart to match.
So I go to work on him. I say:
"Mr. Busch, if you donate this city block, it'll send you to Congress."
He keeps on smoking.
I try to appeal to his sense of chivalry.
He can't even spell it.
I talk to him about his school days.
He never went.
Things are desperate and Barbara Jo was crying so hard...
...she looks like a road show edition of the Johnstown flood.
So I slide right into the theme song.
"Mr. Busch, you're not gonna keep these starving kiddies away...
...from the babbling brooks, and the birds that sing...
...and the vitamins A, B, C, and D.
You're not gonna be responsible for young America growing up with rickets.
Oh, no, not you, Mr. Busch.
Not you. Not a man who reminds me so much of Thomas Jefferson."
Then I had tell him who Jefferson is.
I tell you, he folded up like a wet tent.
He started to cry, tears came as big as Ping-Pong balls.
He just couldn't resist the cause.
It's the sucker shot of the century.
If we play our cards right, use those kids right...
...we'll land right in the middle of Broadway with four-forty written all over us.
And all the time, Mr. Busch just kept sitting there, smoking that smelly old cigar.
And just when I was sure he was gonna say no...
...Mr. Williams got right on top of the desk...
...and he told him what wonderful kids we were.
And if we didn't all get sunshine and fresh air, we'd wind up with pickets.
- With what?
- Pickets.
Darling, you mean rickets.
Well, anyway, he was wonderful, and Mr. Busch finally said he'd go it.
- And you know what, Penny?
- What?
All I could think of was...
...was Abraham Lincoln freeing the slaves.
I'm gonna tell him you said that.
- He'll like that.
- Oh, I wish you would.
- Gee, he's exceptional.
- Yeah.
Too bad he isn't better-looking.
Why, Barbara Jo, he's fine-looking.
He's got character in his face.
You know he turned down an opportunity in a Broadway show just to do this?
- Honest?
- Yes.
And you'll never know what that meant to him.
I couldn't have done it, not even my three little words.
Gosh, he never stops to think of himself.
But he'll be paid back.
You know, Penny, if it was anybody else but you, I'd be jealous.
If it was anybody else but him, you could have him.
- Is it all right?
- Yeah.
- Let's get it on the pole.
- Okay.
- How's that?
- Swell, Tony.
The tempo's perfect. Just right.
I know my dance all right.
Can I go now?
Sure, Ronnie. Sign your name over here.
- I'll have to take the children.
- Right. Thank you, Mrs. Crainen.
- Come on, children.
- Jenny, give me that.
Everybody, can I have your attention please?
After you get through with your work...
...whether painting a sign, practicing a song or dance, you can leave.
Other performers are coming in.
They have to rehearse too.
After your work, sign one of these cards before you go out. Thanks, everybody.
Oh, Penny, get your costume on.
We're gonna do our skit.
- All right.
- Will you come and see my costume?
I have no time now.
All right, everybody, let's have it quiet, please, quiet now!
Everybody, take those signs and banners and posters...
...and put them in the anteroom.
Move that piano here in this corner.
Hurry up, now!
All the rest of you, come on down here by the stand here.
Come on, right up close to the platform.
That's it. Now let me have your attention please! Quiet!
Now, look, we're gonna do the number first, so all of you get in your aprons and overalls.
Come on, now, let's move.
And don't forget, give us lots of zambo.
Go ahead, take it, Johnny.
When our grandmas and our grandpas
Were just girls and boys
They seemed to have
A lot more fun than we
Their party clothes were calicoes
And homemade corduroys
And a big event
Was called a husking bee
A banjo and a fiddle
And a big old-fashioned barn
Was all the preparation that they made
And if they tell you otherwise
Dismiss it as a yarn
Refreshments were confined to lemonade
Now, you may say it's corny
And I guess I must agree
But it was good enough for grandma
It was good enough for grandpa
And it's good enough for me
Hoedown
The country's gone hoedown
It's puttin' its toe down
And kickin' its heel
Hoedown is really a rare dance
A pioneer square dance
But with a new deal
One, two
Swing your partner lightly
While you hold her ever so tightly
Hoedown
And bring your best beau down
We're facing a showdown
And gotta make hay
'Cause hoedown's on its way
Stand in line and do the turkey
Like a Yankee Doodle Dandy
When you turkey, do it jerky
That's the trick
Now you're hoein' on down
Sashay, sashay, sashay around
While you're hoein' on down
Form a circle in the middle
Everybody allemande
Boys keep tempo with the fiddle
And your gal in the calico gown
Hoe on down with your calico gown
Do-si-do around
It's very romantic
Do-si-do
Do-si-do some more
And maybe she'll fall
Now it's time to do your honors
Then when you've gone
Through your honors
Promenade the hall
Hoedown
The country's gone hoedown
Its puttin' its toe down
And kickin' its heel
Hoedown is really a rare dance
A pioneer square dance
But with a new deal
One, two
Swing your partner lightly
While you hold her ever so tightly
Hoedown
And bring your best beau down
We're facing a showdown
And gotta make hay
'Cause hoedown's on its way
Hey!
Hoedown
And bring your best beau down
We're facing a showdown
And gotta make hay
So hoedown
Showdown
Hoedown on its way
- Mr. Stone, you sent for us?
- Yes, I did.
I just received this letter from the Board of Trustees.
I'd like to read it to you.
Oh, here we are.
"We are sending you 20 refugee youngsters from the British war relief...
...on the Fourth of July.
We want you to entertain them...
...and show them what a real
American Fourth of July is like."
This is a great honor for us.
"A shortwave broadcast has been arranged...
...and the English children will talk to their parents in London...
...directly from the settlement house."
The only difficulty is that the broadcast is scheduled for 3:00.
But that's the time that the block party is scheduled for.
Yes, I know, and I'm very sorry, Tommy.
But can't you postpone the block party till the following week?
- No, that's no good.
- We'll never get a permit again.
Wait a minute.
You say they're gonna broadcast, huh?
Well, why not hook up the broadcast with the block party?
From the sidewalks of New York, straight to the Lambeth Walk, huh?
Tommy, that's an excellent idea.
I'll speak to the board about it.
- But, Tommy...
- Wait a minute.
- You do that, will you?
- I will.
And I'll take care of everything.
Now, go on. Go on, now.
- I don't get it.
- Neither do I.
Those Bundles from Britain will be a fine act for us to follow.
- I hope they're a sensation.
- What?
- Don't you get it?
- No.
Three Balls of Fire.
Flashlights, newsroom, radio.
Kids torn from their mothers, thrown into our laps...
...and an international hookup.
- I never thought of the publicity angle.
What a showcase.
This is the cause we've been looking for.
We've been worrying about kids that nobody cares about to the country.
We don't need them anymore.
Penny, it'll be no time until we'll be dancing right up on top of the...
Penny, what's the matter?
Did you say we don't even need those kids anymore?
Penny...
Why didn't you guys shut me up?
Penny, I...
If you'll only...
What's the matter, did you run out of speeches?
You know, you make me feel pretty awful.
Well, you shouldn't.
You're getting everything you wanted.
First, you wanted a cause.
Well, you got it.
Then you wanted a showcase.
Well, you got that too.
Then you wanted to get to Broadway.
Well, you're gonna get there.
Of course, you may knock down a few people and climb over them...
...but you'll get there.
You're gonna be a big success.
You ought to be very happy.
Penny. Gee, you said that as if you hated me.
That's silly. I don't hate you.
I think you're wonderful.
- Your talent, your ambition...
- Well, then, what's the matter?
Nothing.
I just don't think you're Abraham Lincoln anymore, that's all.
Go on, there's your cue.
No, no. This is your party.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...I think it's wonderful the way you've turned out for our block party.
The purpose of this was to give you a sample of what you're gonna see later on.
And of course, to collect enough money to hire a theater.
We're gonna pass the hat now.
Everything we collect will go towards putting on our big show.
And we hope to raise enough money from that...
...to send the settlement house kids to the country.
And now, there's someone that
Mr. Stone feels that you ought to meet.
And nothing would have been possible without him.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Mr. Tommy Williams.
You really gave me away.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.
Thank you very much.
I, well...
Well, in the face of all this, there's just nothing I can say.
For the first time in his life.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a big surprise for you.
As our special guest today...
...we have a group of young people all the way from London, England.
In a few moments, their mothers and fathers will be with us too...
...by way of shortwave transatlantic hookup.
I now take great honor in presenting to you at this time...
...our little cousins from across the sea.
- Hello. Hello, Mrs. Downing.
- Yes, this is Mrs. Downing.
We have your daughter here.
All right, Elinor.
- Hello? Mommy? Is that you?
- Hello, darling. Yes. How are you?
Oh, splendid, Mommy.
I've gained 5 pounds.
How's Daddy and Rex?
Daddy's fine.
Rex is wagging his tail right now.
- How are you getting along, dear?
- Oh, hunky-dory.
- What did you say?
- Hunky-dory. That's American for "okay."
Okay, Elinor.
Hello, Mr. Phillips. Come in, Mr. Phillips.
- Hello?
- Hello, son. How are you, old boy?
Fine. I... l...
Is that all you have to say for yourself?
How do you like America?
Fine little place. Only they drive on the wrong side of the road.
Anything you want me to tell Grandmother?
Oh, yes. Tell her to change the mark on the kitchen wall.
I've grown a whole inch taller.
Good enough. Keep growing, Robert.
We'll be seeing you soon.
Righto, governor.
Oh, tell Billy Hammond
I'm learning to roller skate.
Thank you, Robert. That was swell.
And now, London, I want to introduce little Barbara Jo Conway...
...who is acting as official hostess to all your children...
...at the Fourth of July celebration down here on the East Side of New York.
Hello? Hello, London? Can you hear me?
Gosh, it's wonderful to have your children here.
We really wish you were here too.
And now we've got a special song for you and Penny Morris is gonna sing it for you.
Really, folks, I wish you could see her.
She's beautiful.
From the dark cafes of Paris
From the streets of Amsterdam
From the homes of old vienna
To the shores of Uncle Sam
Wherever freedom's hope is true
Each heart cries out to you
Don't give up, Tommy Atkins
Be a stout fella
Chin up! Cheerio! Carry on!
Keep a stiff upper lip
When you're in doubt, fella
Chin up! Cheerio! Carry on!
Oh, the sun's sure to smile

And you'll turn the blitz on Fritz
There's a whole world behind you
Shoutin', "Stout fella!"
Chin up!
Cheerio!
Carry on!
Carry on!
I knew I never should have opened this show.
Thornton, don't let these small-town critics get you down.
Oh, a Boy Scout could tell what's wrong with this turkey.
It's tired, it's stale, it needs air.
All we need is a couple numbers and jokes.
Jokes? I expected someone to come out and say:
"Who was that lady
I seen you with last night?"
Mason, call New York.
Get Jonesy on the phone.
I'll make a show of this yet.
Get me New York, Plaza 66601.
Say, how about changing the costumes on that hotel number?
Sure, only we'll change the costumes and the music and the backdrop...
...and the actors, every mother's ham of them.
- What are you gonna do, close?
- Thornton Reed never closes.
- Hello? Hello, Jonesy?
- Give me that. Jonesy.
Oh, yes, Thornton.
Yes, I've seen the notices. Yes, Thornton.
We need a new first-act finale and a new number in the second act.
Call every agent in New York, if you have to.
But be here tomorrow night sure...
...and bring some performers with you that can sing and dance.
Yes, and for the love of Philadelphia, don't bring them in wheelchairs.
Get Marelli. See if he can get
Lane and Abbot for Mr. Reed immediately.
- Excuse me.
- Well, Tommy.
Have you seen your pictures in the papers?
Yeah, say, how about that?
- Look, look. Oh, I've got more too.
- I suppose you'll send them to your mother?
Yeah, she'll think I'm running for president.
All hokum aside, Jonesy, how did you like us last night?
I was really impressed.
Well, if you like us, then we're on our way.
We got $42 last night and with your contribution, it makes 67.
All we need is a theater.
You find out about the old Duchess?
Yes, and Mr. Reed still owns it.
But I'm afraid it won't be any good to you, Tommy.
- Why not?
- Well, it hasn't been occupied in years.
Hasn't even any seats in it.
Well, it has a stage, hasn't it?
Yes, but it's a warehouse.
Oh, we don't care. We'll take it.
Here, I got the bread right with me. Here.
- Sixty-seven dollars.
- No, Tommy. I'd have to ask Mr. Reed.
And I can't bother him now.
He's having so much trouble.
Hello? Oh, hello, Marelli.
Did you get them?
But Mr. Reed will give them 1500 and feature billing.
All right, Marelli. Yes, I know you tried.
Thank you.
Don't see why he wouldn't let us have it for one night.
We'd fix it up and everything.
The Duchess? No, no, Tommy.
That's completely out of the question.
Poor Thornton.
I don't know what I'm going to do.
Look, you don't happen to know of an act...
...a good group that could be spotted a couple of times in Mr. Reed's show?
- Sure, I do.
- Who? Where?
- Right here. The Three Balls of Fire.
- No, no, Tommy, I need a big act.
Twelve, 15 people, and a singer.
What about our group and Penny?
How about the act we did yesterday?
- It stopped traffic. You said so yourself.
- I wonder...
No, no, no. Thornton wouldn't...
I don't know why not, though.
Look, could you get that wonderful girl?
What's her name?
- Penny. Penny Morris?
- Yes, could you get her?
Your gang from the drugstore.
Get them together and rehearse.
Do the number tomorrow afternoon at a matinee exactly as you did it last night.
You mean that? You mean?
You mean it? We're gonna...?!
Yes, for Mr. Reed's show tomorrow in Philadelphia.
Tomorrow. Sure, why not?
All right. Get them all together.
Be here in my office at 5:00.
We're taking the 6:00 train for Philadelphia, and may heaven have mercy on my soul.
Six o'clock, 5:00.
We'll be here. Okay!
All aboard for Philadelphia!
Don't move! Stay where you are!
Stop me if I sound crazy...
...but tonight, you, me, and all the kids from the drugstore are leaving on the train...
...and tomorrow in Philadelphia, we open in Thornton Reed's new show!
You think I'm crazy, but I'm not.
We're going tonight.
No luck, eh? Hallelujah.
Truth will out, talent will tell!
- Now, wait...?
- I can see it now.
Tommy Williams, Penny Morris, the Balls of Fire in lights as big as coconuts!
Success! Success, in three easy lessons.
Now what do you think of Williams?
- I think Williams is still Williams.
- What?!
You're going to Philadelphia?
Without me, because...
Without you? Penny, are you crazy?
This is it. What are you talking about?
The same thing.
Those little kids we promised...
That was before.
Thornton Reed, he's in trouble.
If we can save this show, we can land our own ticket.
What about Hammy, Ray, all the kids at the drugstore?
They waited all their lives for a shot like this.
But Reed's got a million dollars.
And you and I and Hammy and Ray can hang on till we get another chance.
- But, gosh, those little kids...
- No.
Oh, Tommy, don't you see?
It's not the two weeks in the country that's gonna cure them.
It's giving a kid something he's dreamed about...
...so maybe he won't feel like there's nothing left to go on for later.
Gosh, I wanna go to Philadelphia just as much as you do.
But if I did it, it would be just like stealing their stockings off the Christmas tree.
I can't do that. I just can't, that's all.
You don't get the point at all.
I'm talking about the lives and careers of 15 people. Artists.
I'm talking about Tommy Williams and Penny Morris, the performers.
That has nothing to do with kids getting to the country.
Let's get to be stars first and then we can...
Never mind, don't bother.
You haven't heard anything I've said.
- Don't make me do anything I regret...
- Go on! Go to Philadelphia!
I hope you stop the show!
Well, all right, then.
I'll get it fixed!
Mr. Williams! Mr. Williams! Mr. Williams,
I've been looking for you all morning...
- I'm sorry, I'm awfully busy.
- Please, it's awfully important.
Everybody's waiting in the auditorium.
Well, all right, hurry up,
I've got an appointment.
Thanks a lot. It'll only take a minute.
Hey, what's this all about?
- What do you want?
- Come on.
- Look, here he comes! Here he comes!
- Here he comes!
- Yeah.
- Come on!
Well, Mr. Williams, all the kids and myself...
...we had a meeting of the executive committee...
...and we were talking about how you gave up a big Broadway show...
...to do all this for us and we weren't doing anything for you.
Well, that's not right.
There's been a lot of talk around this place about getting us to the country.
But nobody ever did anything about it except you.
You just walked right in and didn't listen to anybody.
And now we're going.
After all the promises, we're really going.
Well, well, we just wanna say thank you.
But with 50 kids to do it, it would take an awful long time.
We know you're a busy man.
So we all chipped in and bought you a present, and here it is.
You shouldn't have.
You shouldn't have done this, because l...
Don't you like it?
Sure, sure I like it.
It's swell. In fact, it's one of the nicest presents I've ever seen.
You shouldn't have spent the money on me, though.
But I'm glad you did, because every time I look at this watch...
...l'm gonna see every one of your faces...
...and gonna remember what a swell gang you are.
Honest, you'll never know what it means to me.
All I can say is that
I haven't even started to earn it.
But I will.
And after it's all over with and all through...
...I hope that you'll be glad that you gave it to me.
And you don't have to worry about the country...
...because you're not only going, but you're gonna go first class too.
Penny. Penny.
- Hello, Mr. Stone.
- How do you do?
Oh, excuse me. Is Penny here?
- I think she's up on the roof.
- Oh, thanks.
Penny...
You better hurry.
You're gonna miss that train.
I just have one more speech to make and I have to make it.
You don't have to listen if you don't want to.
Go ahead, I'm listening.
All my life, I've been rehearsing myself to be a big man...
...and it's taken me just five minutes to find out that I'm only a heel.
Bunch of little kids chip in their nickels and dimes...
...to buy me a $5 watch marked down to 3.50. There it is.
And I'm so ashamed at myself that it took a bunch of 6-year-olds...
...to make me realize that there's more to life than just a song, a dance and an encore.
And that there's more to people than just sitting out front, being an audience.
Well, it's half past 1 and that's the end of my speech.
Oh, Tommy, that's a wonderful speech.
And life begins at half past 1.
Penny, I've got a couple of words
I wanna say to you...
...just this time, sitting down.
Only a couple?
Well, really three.
Well, go ahead and say them and get them over with.
Oh, I could say "I love you" just like all the rest of them.
That's still good, you know.
But it wouldn't tell you what I really mean.
I'll settle for it.
Oh, no, you're not gonna talk me out of my love scene.
Were you ever in a rainstorm...
...and you felt like you were the only person in the world that wasn't getting wet?
Did you ever look up and see a full moon and...
...well, it only looked like a half a moon to you...
...because you were looking at it all alone?
Penny, did you ever find someone and...
...and all of a sudden, you felt like you were taking off, right out into space...
...like a propeller going round and round and round, 30,000 revolutions a minute...
...and there wasn't any landing fields left in the world?
I've had that feeling.
And it all started in a drugstore.
- Penny.
- Yeah?
Tommy.
Oh, isn't it wonderful what you can find these days in drugstores?
- Yeah.
- Oh, gosh.
And that's about all there is to it.
I know, it even sounds crazy to me, but that's the way it has to be.
Well, I guess I'll have to send these railroad tickets back, then.
Gee, I hate to have you do that.
- Maybe if l...
- Tommy.
I hope you don't think we're ungrateful,
Miss Jones...
...because you've been simply wonderful...
...but this is the way Tommy and I have decided to do it.
Isn't it, Tommy?
Yeah, yeah, that's what we've decided.
You're giving up this great opportunity to help a bunch of kids you hardly know.
Helping people's hard work, isn't it?
Don't you worry.
You'll find it's worthwhile at the oddest times and the strangest places.
How soon can you get your show together?
Our show? Oh, in about 10 days.
Yeah, our only problem is getting a theater.
Well, there's no problem now.
- You mean we can have the old Duchess?
- Yes.
No, put your bread away.
If the theater's any good to you...
...you can have it as
Thornton's contribution to the cause.
He doesn't even have to know.
It's on Gilmore Street, about seven blocks from the settlement house.
- How about that?
- It's wonderful, I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything.
Just get your show started and make it good.
Thornton doesn't know it, and he won't until I'm ready to tell him...
...but he's gonna see your show in his theater from the front row.
- Oh, you see, Tommy?
- Yeah.
But Miss Jones, won't Mr. Reed be angry?
Very likely.
That's why it's got to be good.
Otherwise, I'll find myself in the country with the rest of the kids.
Gosh. Isn't it beautiful?
It's kind of run-down, isn't it?
It's wonderful.
Well, maybe after we clean it up and brighten it a little...
...but right now, it's giving me the creeps.
- It does?
- It's kind of like a haunted house.
Penny, every theater is a haunted house.
Ghosts with greasepaint...
...ghosts that sing and dance and laugh and cry.
You should think of all the shows that have been in this theatre.
Flops, successes, bad shows, great shows.
You can't tell me that that ever dies.
It's all around us right now, all the laughter and applause, cheers.
Why, it's on every inch of this old stage up here.
- Do you see what I mean?
- Yeah, I see what you mean.
Then when new ones come along, kids like us...
...that love the theatre just as much as they did...
...they're glad and they're rooting for us.
They're saying, "This is your chance.
Go on out there, we've had ours, now it's your turn.
There's your audience.
They're waiting for you."
Can't you just see it now?
Look.
The leader taps his stand with his stick.
The music starts.
The footlights gradually come up.
This is that one breathless moment when everything in the world comes to a stop.
Over in the wings, the light man at the board reaches for the switch.
Now the hands that pull the curtain are on the rope, waiting for the cue.
The curtain rises slowly.
I never saw them, but I feel as though
I'd been here watching them every night.
Richard Mansfield in Cyrano de Bergerac.
I know just how he felt, standing there, waiting for his cue.
Your nose is rather large.
- Have you quite finished, sir?
- I should say that is sufficient.
You humdrum dolt.
How dare you insult a splendid nose with such meager, piddling words?
Let me show you what you might have said had you had an ounce...
...yes, even an ounce of imagination or wit.
To wit, insolent.
What do you do with that nose when drinking?
Does it go above the glass or below the glass, for surely, it does not fit inside.
Descriptive. It's a rock.
It's a mountain.
What am I saying, a mountain?
It's a peninsula. Eloquent.
What is that dazzling thing, sir?
Is it a torch? A bonfire? A volcano?
Stamp it out before it blinds my eyes.
- Buffoon.
- Who, me?
So be it.
Prepare to die exquisitely.
- Poet.
- Yes, poet.
Swordsman, take your choice.
No, wait. You shall have both.
For while I fight with you,
I shall compose a ballad...
...and with the last line of my poem, my sword shall run you through.
Swiftly, my hat is tossed aside.
Slowly, my cloak is allowed to fall over my left free arm.
And to draw and we stand on guard.
Lunge, and my sword is met with yours.
Dancers of steel that dazzle the eye.
Back you go, in time to my verse.
And then, when I have finished my song, you die.
Pray now, while you still have life.
Prince, pray, with your final sigh.
Stay, look sharp, I've run out of verse.
And now, as I finish my song, you die
For it is Mary, Mary
Plain as any name can be
But with propriety
Society will say "Marie"
But it was Mary, Mary
Long before the fashions came
And there is something there
That sounds so square
It's a grand old name
But it was Mary, Mary
Long before the fashions came
And there is something there
That sounds so square
It's a grand old name
For she's my Daisy
My bonnie Daisy
She's as sweet as sugar candy
And she's very fond of Sandy
And I worry for my dearie
I would rather lose my kilt
Than lose my Daisy
For I would rather lose my kilt
Than lose my Daisy
Sure, I've got rings on my fingers
And bells on my toes
Elephants to ride upon
My little Irish rose
So come to your nabob
On next Patrick's Day
Be Mistress Mumbo-Jumbo
Jij-Ji-Bo J. O'Shea
Sure, I've got rings on my fingers
And bells on my toes

I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy
Yankee Doodle do or die
A real live nephew of my Uncle Sam
I was born on the 4th of July
I've got a Yankee Doodle sweetheart
She's my Yankee Doodle joy
Yankee Doodle came to London
Just to ride the ponies
Say, I am a Yankee Doodle Boy
He's a Yankee Doodle Dandy
A Yankee Doodle do or die
A real live nephew of his Uncle Sam
Born on the 4th of July
I've got a Yankee Doodle sweetheart
She's my Yankee Doodle joy
Yankee Doodle came to London
Just to ride the ponies
I am a Yankee Doodle boy
- Come in.
- Oh, Tommy, they're beautiful.
- Maybe I should have got a dozen more.
- No, one would have been enough.
Once, you told me I was gonna be dancing on top of the world...
...and tonight, I'm all filled up with things
I've been saving to say...
...but now that the time is here,
I guess I'll just go on and say them, huh?
But, Tommy... oh, no, don't go.
I want to thank you too.
You've done so much and...
...I guess I'll never be happier than I am tonight.
- Hey, Tommy, your mother's here.
- Oh, Mom! How are you?
Wait a minute. What are you doing, working your way through college?
I bought them all on the train.
I was saving them for you.
You've grown a little, haven't you?
Mom, I'd like you to meet some of my friends.
No, no, no. Don't tell me.
This is Penny, of course.
I'm awful glad to meet you.
How'd you know it was me?
Tommy writes such wonderful descriptions.
- And of course, this is Hammy.
- No, Mom, that's Ray.
In back of you, that's Hammy.
- Of course, the one with the blank verse.
- That's him.
- Fifteen minutes.
- I've got to go.
Excuse me. I'll see you after the show.
And here. This is for recognizing me.
You go on out and get your seat now.
See you after the show.
You come back, if you'll talk to me.
Here it is, son, this wonderful minute, just as we talked about it so many times.
Yeah, sort of jumped up on top of us, huh?
Yes, and the funniest thing is
I'm not the least bit nervous.
No, no, of course, you're not.
Of course, you're not. Here.
Give me a kiss for good luck, huh?
- You got your tickets?
- Yes.
- I'll see you after the show. Bye.
- All right.
Gosh, what a peach of a mom, huh?
- I wish Jonesy and Reed would get here.
- Don't worry, Jonesy won't let us down.
- You think he'll go for us?
- He'll go for us.
I hope they don't leave before our big number.
With Jonesy on one side and mom on the other, I'm taking the short end of the bet.
- Ten minutes.
- Hey, we'd better hurry.
I'm gonna go out front and see the house, huh? Be right back.
- Mr. Williams, how do I look?
- You look swell, Barbara Jo.
- Good luck to you.
- Thanks.
Tommy Williams. My boy.
Acting since he was that high.
- Tommy. Hey, Tommy.
- Yeah?
- She's here. Jones.
- Oh, swell. Excuse me, Maria.
Jonesy, am I glad to see you.
Where is he?
- He's not here, Tommy.
- Not here?
I'm terribly sorry, Tommy.
Does that mean he's not coming?
You promised us...
I know I promised you, Tommy, but I just couldn't ask him.
The poor guy is going crazy in Philadelphia.
The show isn't doing any business.
They're rewriting, recasting.
On top of all that, he twisted his ankle.
I had to sneak out of town myself.
Never mind, we'll put the show on, it'll be great and he'll hear about it.
- Won't he, Jonesy?
- Overture's in.
Come on, Tommy, you're gonna be late.
Hurry up.
Everybody, come here for a minute.
Come on around me.
Come on. Wait a minute.
I got something to tell you.
This is the first time in years that the curtain's gone up in the old Duchess.
Let's make them glad they didn't tear it down, huh?
What do you say?
Come on, places, everybody!
- Run for your lives!
- Stay where you are!
- Make a lot of noise!
- Keep still!
A bombshell just fell over Brazil
- Lay down your arms
- Run up your flags
You'll surrender to this jill
This bombshell that fell over Brazil
Her contribution
To the art of elocution
Is apt to start a revolution
Among the ladies at the Ritz
In Rio de Janeiro
When she sings "Mamae Eu Quero"
Every local caballero
Admits that it's a blitz
So give up the ship
Throw in the sponge
Get ready for a great big thrill
For here comes
That bombshell from Brazil
Hey, Ma!
- How was it?
- Sensational.
- You murdered them.
- Come on, we only got a minute to change.
I was nervous.
I forgot the second chorus.
- You were great. Keep on being nervous.
- Don't forget...
- Who's Tommy Williams?
- I am.
I'm Inspector Moriarity.
Who are these two apples?
- They're my partners.
- Your partners?
What do you think you're doing?
We're in the middle of a number.
We're on stage in a minute.
- Come back around...
- Slow down, Mr. Ziegfeld.
- You ain't putting on any show.
- What do you mean?
- We're not putting on a show?
- Who says?
State of New York, City of New York, board of health, and fire commission.
Shall I go on?
We're putting on a show. People bought tickets. They're out in front now.
That's what I'm talking about.
You can't lock people in a firetrap.
This theatre's been condemned for 15 years.
- I don't believe it.
- It's a plot.
Mr. Moriarity, you can't stop the show.
Please, don't stop it.
- Fifty little kids that never saw the sunlight.
- With rickets.
We've worked day and night like dogs, like slaves. My mother, she...
I know all about the kids and I've got a mother too...
...but if that audience isn't out of there in
15 minutes, I'll have to call the 8th Precinct.
- Mr. Moriarity, couldn't you...?
- I'm sorry, fellas, I know how you feel.
I almost was in a show myself once.
- Tommy. Tommy!
- Come in.
Come on. The orchestra's played your cue three times.
Aren't you coming out on the stage?
Yeah, I'm coming out.
Bet I get a million laughs too.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...l'm terribly sorry, but something unexpected has come up...
...and we will not be able to continue the show.
It's some fire regulation or something like that, something we knew nothing about.
And I'm awfully sorry that we can't give the show...
...because it's really a wonderful show and I'm sure that you would have all liked it.
Anyhow, we want to thank each and every one of you for coming here...
...and having faith in us and trying to help the send the kids to the country.
Everybody did their best.
So if you will stop by the box office on your way out...
...why, your money will be cheerfully refunded. Thank you.
Tommy, don't eat your heart out.
You did the best you could and we're awful proud of you.
Yeah. Everybody did their best and where did it get us?
Right out in left field.
No, don't help yourself, help everybody else.
Be a Santa Claus, make sacrifices.
If you can do that for the rest of your life...
...you'll be a big success, when you're about 165 years old.
- Tommy, you don't mean that.
- You can bet I do.
Where did it get us?
No money for the kids, no show...
...chance with Thornton Reed blown right out of the window.
Tommy, you mustn't let it make you bitter, please.
Faith, hope and charity.
Take those kids and wrap them in cellophane and give them back to the Indians.
From now on, it's the old rules for me.
I'll get a chance again.
When I do, look out.
Because I'm gonna take anything from anybody, at any time, any place.
- Tommy, l...
- No.
Mr. Williams.
They didn't take it. They didn't take it.
- Didn't take what?
- Come on, you tell him, Mr. Stone, tell him.
Tommy, it's amazing.
Everybody went right by the box office.
- They wouldn't take their money back.
- Some of them gave money besides.
Seven hundred and forty dollars.
Isn't it wonderful?
We got all the money to go to the country.
Now there's no need for putting on a show at all.
Yeah. You're right.
There's no need in putting a show on at all.
Tommy.
Mr. Stone, there's something
I'd like to say.
I know that the main purpose is getting
Barbara Jo and the kids to the country...
...but there's something else that we have to take into consideration.
Tommy and his friends gave up a lot more than most of you know about.
Getting this show on to them is just as important as going to the country.
So I think that it would be fair...
...if we let him decide if he wants to use this money to hire a theatre...
...and get his chance to put the show on.
And they can go to the country later on, maybe next year.
Well, I don't know what to say.
What do you think, Josephine?
Well, I suppose if it's fair.
Sure, we can go later on.
You'd give this to me?
Sure, if it's fair.
No, Jo.
You're not only going to the country, but you're leaving tomorrow morning.
- Mr. Williams.
- Splendid.
Where are they? It's ridiculous, fantastic fabulous. I absolutely can't believe it.
I want to find how anyone could do a thing like this to me.
- Where are they?
- Thornton. It's Thornton.
- Mr. Reed? I thought he was in Philadelphia.
- Run, don't walk, to the nearest exit.
Who'd...? There you are!
I knew you had a hand in this fiasco.
Now, Thornton, don't get excited.
We only...
I've got a $ 100,000 turkey in Philadelphia and what do I get?
Fire commission, board of health, police department, warrants for my arrest!
Thornton, I'm terribly sorry, it's all my fault.
But there's no harm done.
No harm done? They bring me back to town as though I were a criminal!
I thought they were crazy.
A show in my own theatre and I don't even know it.
Thornton, unravel. There isn't any show and there isn't going to be one.
Wait a minute, maybe...
Mr. Reed, will you listen to me for just a minute?
Mr. Reed, I'm so glad you're here.
It's against the law to put our show on for an audience.
There's no law against putting it on for you.
You didn't buy a ticket!
Now she wants to sell me a ticket!
- Mason?
- Yes, sir.
No, no, Mr. Reed, dear Mr. Reed, we spent weeks and weeks.
We gave up everything.
All we want you to do is just sit down.
I've got trouble enough without amateur...!
- Quick, Tommy, get them ready.
- Yeah.
Bring the curtain down. Mr. Morris, hurry.
Get the orchestra in the pit.
Please, just watch this one number, especially Tommy Williams.
And I give you my word of honor, it won't hurt a bit.
Come on, Daddy, the overture.
Here we are, six characters
Depressed and melancholy
Here we are, six characters
In search of a finale
We've racked our brains
And taxed our minds
To find a trick that's new
But still we haven't got
The slightest idea what to do
We might try a Russian ballet
But a ballet might disclose
That I am more athletic
Than aesthetic on my toes
Say, how about a circus?
We could all go acrobatic
Now, here's a trick I learned in school
To strengthen my sciatic
We could all go South American
And cut a South American rug
But I'd never arrive
I ain't hep to their jive
I'm just a Brooklyn jitterbug
Hold everything... I've got it, pals
Let's do an aquacade
It's true that I can't swim a stroke
But you ought to see me wade
What's wrong with doing something old?
Something tried and true
Well, how about a minstrel show?
Does that appeal to you?
A good old-fashioned minstrel show
- That suits us
- Well, then let's go!
Go and tell New York
To grab a piece of cork
And join that blackout over Broadway
Everybody's gonna be dancin' on air
When they hear them
Playing "Swanee River" in Times Square
Every southern lass
Is gonna cook with gas
And boy, that southern cookin's okay
And when you hear that moan
On the slide trombone
You'll wanna black up
For that blackout over Broadway
Go and tell the town
They ought to come on down
And join that blackout over Broadway
You'll see Andrew Jackson Brown
Straight from the south
And if he don't entertain you
You can shut my mouth
There'll be so much fun
That long before we're done
Those angels up in heaven will say
"Ain't got no time to stall
Spread your wings, you all
And start to black up
For that blackout over Broadway"
Every southern lass
Is gonna cook with gas
And boy, that southern cookin's okay
And when you hear that moan
On the slide trombone
You'll wanna black up
For that blackout over Broadway!
Gentlemen, be seated.
Mr. Tambo, Mr. Tambo
How do you do?
And incidentally, how do you feel?
Well, now, I feels just like a stovepipe
Nothing else, buddy
You feels just like a stovepipe?
Yeah, sooty
Now, Mr. Bones, Mr. Bones
It's good to see you
And incidentally, Mr. Bones
How do you feel?
How does I feel?
Well, man, I feels just like
A fireplace here of late
You say you feels just like a fireplace?
I said it, I feels grate
We all expect some dancing
When the minstrels come to town
So now may I present to you
Mr. Rufus Rastus Jefferson Davis Brown
By the light of the silvery moon
I want to spoon
By the light of the moon
To my honey, I'll croon love's tune
Honey moon, keep a-shinin' in June
The month of June
Your silvery beams
Will bring love's dreams
We'll be cuddlin' soon
Oh, make it soon
By the silvery moon
By the silvery moon
By the silvery moon
Oh, Mr. Interlocutor
Could there be something wrong?
We are waiting just
To hear Mr. Tambo do his song
Mr. Tambo
Do you feel good and strong?
Then get right up and show the folks
How you can sing that song
I hear tell there's a stranger
In the Jones household
- Yes, sirree, yes, sirree
- That's what I'm told
I hear tell there's a new arrival
Six days old
- Yes, sirree, yes, sirree
- Worth his wait in gold
Come right in
And meet the son
Christening's done
Time to have some fun
- Yes, sirree, yes, sirree
- Yes, sirree
Yes, sirree, yes, sirree
It's a big holiday everywhere
For the Jones family
Has a brand-new heir
He's a joy, heaven-sent
And we proudly present
Mr. Franklin D. Roosevelt Jones
When he grows up
He never will stray
With a name
Like the one that he's got today
When he walks down the street
Folks will say
"Pleased to meet
Mr. Franklin D. Roosevelt Jones "
What a smile
And how he shows it
He'll be happy all day long
What a name
I'll bet he knows it
With that handle
How can he go wrong?
And the folks in the town all agree
He'll be famous
As famous as he can be
How can he be a dud
Or a stick-in-the-mud
When he's Franklin D. Roosevelt Jones?
Go to sleep, my baby
And maybe you'll balance the budget
By and by
Oh, you're a lucky baby
With Franklin D. For your name
Mrs. Jones' baby boy
Is a welcome resident
Give him a fishing rod for a toy
He's the future president
When this rascal goes to school
ABC's won't matter
Teach him plain old 'rithmetic
And of course, some fireside chatter
My friends, my friends
Let's all shout hooray!
It's a big holiday everywhere
For the Jones family
Has a brand-new heir
We'll be proud to affirm
When he serves his fourth term
- Just you wait and see
- Yeah!
- He'll make history
- Yeah!
'Cause he's Franklin D. Roosevelt Jones!
Oh, ring, ring the banjo
For Franklin Roosevelt Jones
But when you hear the banjo
It's played by Mr. Bones
Way down on the levee
In old Alabamy
There's Daddy and Mammy
There's Ephraim and Sammy
On a moonlight night
You can find them all
While they are waitin'
The banjos are syncopatin'
Oh, what's that they're sayin'?
Oh, what's that they're sayin'?
While they keep playin'
And hummin' and swayin'
It's the good ship Robert E. Lee
That's here to carry the cotton away
Watch them shufflin' along
See them shufflin' along
Go take your best gal
Your real pal
Go down on the levee
I said to the levee
And we'll join that shufflin' throng
Hear that music and song
It's simply great, mate
Waitin' on the levee
Waitin' for the Robert E. Lee!
We're babes on Broadway
We're goin' places
When our new faces appear
It's a wonderful street
For babes like us to be on
We're here because
We want our names in neon
We left Topeka
We left Eureka
And came to seek a career
Oh, we're milkin' applause
Instead of milkin' a cow
'Cause we're babes on Broadway now!
Fun, fun, fun
And fancy-free
Da, da, dat
Da, da, dat, doit
Full of fun and fancy-free
That's the way I wanna be
I don't let my troubles trouble me
Dau, dau, dau
Dau, dau, dau
Fancy-free
Full of the, full of fun
Got no time to worry none
Too busy singin' in the sun
Sweet sun
If you should have a chronic ache
Pills won't make you strong
The only tonic you should take
Is a teaspoonful of song
So if you'd really like to be
Happy-go-lucky, just like me
Drown your frowns, my friend and you will see
You'll see
That you'll be full of fun
And fancy-free
Come along,
Lend an ear
See it for yourself
Meet a guy who's got a song
Troubles are on the shelf
He's so happy all the livelong day
Livin' life the simple way
Knowin' it's the only way to be
Just full of fun
Full of fun and fancy-free
Just full of fun
Full of fun and fancy-free
Everyone keeps askin' me
My recipe for livin'
It's simple as the ABC's
And hardly seems worth givin'
I've tried it out in every way
It always sees me through
It's made me what I am today
That's why I'm tellin' you
- I'm a happy-go-lucky fellow
- Ooh, doo, doo, doo
- Full of fun and fancy-free
- Doo, doo, doo
You can make the whole world seem mellow
- If you take it in your stride like me
- Ooh, doo, doo
Don't cross a bridge or peek 'round the corner
- Until you're there
- Oh
- Just learn to smile and in a while
- Doo, doo
You'll find trouble's a bubble of air
- Get a happy-go-lucky feelin'
- Doo
- Keep it and I guarantee
- Ooh
- That you'll find you'll wind up livin' in the sun
- So right
Full of fun and fancy-free
Full of fun and fancy-free
That's the way I wanna be
I don't let my troubles trouble me
Now some folks like the heavy stuff
With titles five feet wide
- Not me, I'm always out for fun
- Doo, doo, doo
- I like the lighter side, yes, sir
- Hooray
La, da, da, dee, la, da, da, dee Uh-oh!
Don't let my troubles trouble me
Don't cross a bridge or peek 'round the corner
Until you're there
Just learn to smile and in a while
You'll find trouble's a bubble of air
Get a happy-go-lucky feelin'
You know, you worry too much.
In fact, everybody worries too much.
Here. Just look at the morning paper.
Turn to any page.
You'll find the whole world worryin'... about some future age.
But why get so excited?
What's gonna be is gonna be.
The end of the world's been comin' since 1903.
That's, uh, B.C., of course.
Don't cross a bridge or peek 'round the corner
Until you're there
Just learn to smile and in a while
You'll find trouble
You bet, you'll find trouble!
Oh! Aah! Ohh!
Take it easy, son.
Why, you're just a bundle of nerves.
You see? Jumpy as a cat!
Comes from always rushin' into things.
Hmm! Now what have I done?
I guess I don't know my own strength.
Sorry to upset you, miss.
Have you on your feet in a jiffy.
- Upsy-daisy.
- Mama!
Your mama isn't here, honey.
But if I can be of service, the name is Cricket.
Uh, J. Cricket. You can call me Jiminy.
Oops! Sorry! Ha-ha.
Oh. Howdy, chum.
Why so glum?
Say, what's the matter? You worried about somethin' too?
Tsk, tsk. Never saw such a dismal pair.
A deadpan doll and a droopy bear.
You ought to try my recipe.
Be full of fun and fancy-free.
Life is a song... happy, gay.
So let's have some music.
Come on! What d'you say?
"Bongo"? Now, what in the world is Bongo?
Oh! "A Musical Story
Sung by Dinah Shore."
Well, what are we waitin' for?
Da, da, doo, da
A ringer!
It's a gift.
Da, da, dee, da, la, doh
La, da
Take it away, Dinah!
This is the story...
- of three bears.
- Yeah, I know.
The mama bear, the papa bear, and the itsy-bitsy baby bear.
But it's not the story you expect.
This is a love story.
It's about a little girl bear... and a big, burly, brawny brown bear... who wanted very much to be her boyfriend.
But mostly, this is a story about Bongo.
He was a circus bear.
He was born in the circus, grew up in the circus.
In fact, Bongo was the star of the circus.
In fact, Bongo was the star of the circus.
Why, he could juggle and dance while on a trapeze, walk a tightrope with the greatest of ease.
In jujitsu, he was beyond compare.
Once threw a bull at the county fair.
Super at wrestling and lifting weights.
Outboxed the champs of 1 7 states.
They all packed in from near and far... to see this death-defying star.
With mouths wide open, they watched his ascent... as he daringly climbed to the top of the tent!
Then, for a grand climax, he would gracefully plunge 300 feet... into a wet sponge!
Poor Bongo.
Naturally, you'd think he'd be handled with kid gloves, treated like a king... and pampered like a baby.
But, no! He was tossed around like an old shoe.
Bongo, the bear in the gilded cage.
His thoughts would wander to an imaginary life... far removed from the circus.
Bongo, Bongo, Bongo
Bongo, Bongo, Bongo
Some half-forgotten instinct kept calling him.
For you see, Bongo was a dreamer.
Hey, Bongo! Get going! You're on!
The call of the wild kept ringing in his ears.
Psst! Hey. Bongo!
He couldn't ignore it any longer.
Bongo, Bongo, Bongo
He had to answer the call of the great open spaces.
Come on out, Bongo.
Bongo, Bongo
Come on out, Bongo.
Come on out, Bongo!
Bongo, Bongo.
He was crackin' up!
Bongo, Bongo!
- He was losin' his grip!
- Bongo, Bongo, Bongo!
He had to escape, to get away!
Just gotta get away!
- Bongo, Bongo!
- Gotta get away! Gotta get away.
- Bongo, Bongo, Bongo!
- Gotta, gotta, gotta!
Bongo! Bongo!
Bongo! Bongo!
Bongo! Bongo! Bongo!
Bongo! Bongo! Bongo!
At last he was free.
Free. Free?
Oh! But this was even better than he'd expected!
"Oh, boy, "thought
Bongo, "this is livin'!"
Whoo!
He felt so good, he just had to run around... and jump.
Why, he even tried to growl.
"Oh, boy! A tree. That's for me!"
Just right for climbin' too.
"Oh, well. What if I can't climb a big old tree?
This is still the place for a fellow like me."
- Ooh, ah, ohh
- Just lazy and loafin'... and fancy-free.
- I love to hang around
- Ooh
The lazy countryside
Where things are nice and breezy
With nature's gang around
The lazy countryside
Where life is twice as easy
Where the crickets
You don't hear in the city
Keep a-hummin' in your ear
Oh, so pretty
And it's just too much for words
Listenin' to the chorus of the birds
I like to stay around
The lazy countryside
And while away the hours
Just kind of play around
The lazy countryside
As free as bees and flowers
There's more fun in takin' the sun in
And to roam the spaces wide
It's the place for me
Gee, but it's great to be
'Round the lazy countryside
There's more fun in takin' the sun in
And to roam the spaces wide
It's the place for me
Gee, but it's great to be
'Round the lazy
Countryside
"Oh, boy," thought Bongo,
"this is the stuff."
"To stretch out under a canopy of stars...
"studding the velvet softness of the night.
To sleep in the peace and quiet of the woods."
The stillness of the night descends like a sheltering veil.
Hush. All nature sleeps.
Then came the dawn.
Ohh. Bongo felt as stiff as a board... and as cranky as an old bear.
Bongo was discouraged.
A fine kind of bear he'd turned out to be!
He didn't even know how to act like a bear.
This rough, rugged stuff wasn't for him.
Especially on an empty stomach.
Uh-uh.
Bongo thought, "This is just too good to be true!
"I... I'm either hungry or I'm still dreamin'.
"Ow! I'm awake! It must be true.
Oh, this is much better than dreamin'!"
"This must be heaven.
I-it can't be real!
"It's just too good to be true.
But let me go right on dreamin', as long as I'm with you."
This is too good
To be true
I can't believe it's real
Can it be you
I really see
I never knew
I'd find an angel
And out of the blue
You came to me
You're all the heavenly things
That I've been dreaming of
Don't spread your wings
And fly away
But if you're only
Passing through
Then take me to heaven with you
Or is this a dream
Too good to be
True
This is too good to be true
I can't believe it's real
Can it be you
I really see
I never knew I'd find an angel
Out of the blue you came to me
You're all the heavenly things
That I've been dreaming of
Don't spread your wings
Don't fly away
But if you're only
Passing through
Then take me to heaven with you
Or is this a dream
Too good to be
True
The air grew still with a sudden chill.
No talk, no laughs, no chatter.
With the trees shaking, the ground quaking, the crowd began to scatter.
Out of his lair came the third bear, with murder in his eye.
He took in the scene of love serene with jealousy and surprise.
He was the roughest, toughest, meanest bear.
Lump jaw by name, a villain for fair.
Well... what's this?
It's no dream. It's a nightmare!
"He-He-Hello," was all Bongo could say.
"Hmm. Kind of unfriendly.
Probably doesn't know who I am."
"Just a moment. This is my affair."
"He-He-Hello, Lulubelle, dear."
Gosh, Bongo was surprised.
Why should Lulubelle turn against him?
That was no way for a lady to act.
Lulubelle's feelings were hurt.
All right.
She'd give Mr. Bongo just one more chance.
"What have I done?"
Poor Bongo.
It was too good
- To be true
- Ah
Gone were his dreams.
His world was shattered.
Why hadn't someone ever told him about all of these things... that really mattered?
- And now,
- Ah well, now it was just too late.
He'd never find out that when bears are in love, they always say it with a slap.
When a bird loves a bird he can twitter
When a puppy falls in love he can yap
Every pigeon likes to coo when he says I love you
But a bear likes to say it with a slap
When a whippoorwill's in love he can whipper
All the horses neck and all the turtles snap
Every deer and every dove has a way of makin' love
But a bear likes to say it with a slap
You can ask any bear, Oh
There's nothin' to compare
With a love tap
Strong or weak
So if you're ready for romance and you ever get the chance
- Grab your girl
- Give her your cheek
- So when love comes along Don't be silly
- Doo, doo, doo, doo
- Never ever waste your time like a sap
- Doo, doo, doo, doo
Let the others hug and kiss but the bare facts are this
That a bear likes to say it with a slap
- Slap, slap
- Give me a love tap
Grab your bears and swing 'em wide
Shake their fur and scratch their hide
Give her a slap
Give her a cuff
Go 'round that floor and strut your stuff
He slapped her once and he missed her jaw and he wound up smackin' his mother-in-law
Now here comes Grandpa gettin' in line, And here comes baby bear behind
- Whoo-hoo!
- Oh, oh, oh, oh
When a bird loves a bird he can twitter
When a puppy falls in love he can yap
Every pigeon likes to coo when he says I love you
But a bear likes to say it with a slap
When a whippoorwill's in love he can whipper
All of the horses neck and all the turtles snap
Every deer and every dove has a way of makin' love
But a bear likes to say it with a slap
You can ask any bear
Oh, there's nothing to compare with a love tap strong or weak
If you're ready for romance
And you ever get the chance
Grab your girl give her your cheek
So when love comes along don't be silly
Never ever waste your time like a sap
Let the others hug and kiss but the bare facts are this
That a bear likes to say it with a slap
Slap, slap
So when love comes along don't be silly
Never ever waste your time like a sap
Let the others hug and kiss
But the bare facts are this
That a bear likes to say it with a slap
"I love you, Lulubelle."
"I love you too, Bongo."
You're all the heavenly things
That I've been dreaming of
Ohh don't spread your wings
And fly away
But if you're only
Passing through
Then take me to heaven with you
Ooh
Or is this a dream
Too good to be
- True
- Is it only a dream
Too good to be true
Excuse me. There.
Now who says dreams don't come true? Well!
Three is a crowd, they say.
So I'll drop back another day.
" Miss Luana Patten."
Mmm! Well.
Of course, it's not cricket to read other folks' mail, but...
"A party!
Tonight!" Mmm.
"The house across the way.
"Charlie McCarthy. Mortimer Snerd!
Edgar Bergen?" Huh.
Never heard of him.
"Please come!"
Why, I'd be delighted!
Join the party
Come along
It's a cinch
Can't go wrong
Now's the time to see what you can see
The house is just across the way
Better hurry
Don't delay
You'll be full of fun and fancy-free
Oh, dear. Nanny goats and petticoats.
- I'm a caution.
- Yes, you certainly are.
Tell me, what is the secret of your lovely complexion?
- Well, I... I use saddle soap.
- I see.
Yes. If I'm not being too personal, Ophelia...
- Yeah?
- Uh, how old are you?
- Oh, I'm, uh, a girl my age.
- A girl your age?
- Yes.
- And how old is that?
- Uh, 28.
- Twenty-eight.
I thought you were a little bit older than that.
Well, I knocked off a few years for good behavior.
I don't care for that.
It's kid stuff. Ha-ha.
Well, we're awfully glad you came to our party.
- Well.
- Did you have fun?
Oh, yes, indeedy. I thought Charlie made a pig of himself with that chocolate cake.
- Oh, you're quite right.
- Yes, I am. Yes.
Yes, I agree with you.
- Well, good night, Luana.
- Good night, Ophelia.
- Bonne nuit, Mortimer.
- Uh... ma'am?
- Bonne nuit.
- Oh, yes, ma'am. Yeah, yeah. Bunny...
Uh, bunny, bunny wee, bunny wee. Bun...
Uh... uh, I don't know no bunny wee.
- Good night, Charlie.
- Uh, good night.
- You know, Ophelia, you look so sweet.
- Ah, what'd you say?
- I say, I think you look so sweet.
- Yes?
- I'm going to kiss you good night.
- Oh, help, help, help!
Help, he...
Isn't that a wonderful trick?
Yes, it is. Yes. I wish I could enjoy my first childhood... as much as he does his second.
Now, Luana, how would you like another piece of cake or some ice cream?
- No, thank you. I'm full up.
- Some candy?
- Care for a cigar?
- Me?
How about you, Mortimer?
- Mortimer?
- Uh... I don't smoke.
I don't mean that. Well, what shall we do now? Any suggestions?
How would you like to go down to the city dump and watch me slug rats?
- Certainly not.
- No?
How would you like to hear me tell a story?
Oh, I'd love it.
Wouldn't you, Charlie?
Well, I, uh... y-y-yeah... no.
This is a story that everyone should know.
Yes, but not everyone should tell it. And you know who.
Well, I'm going to tell it anyway.
Now, many, many years ago...
I think I'll run out and wind a sundial.
- You'll stay right here.
- Yes, sir.
Once upon a time, long, long ago...
Funny, nothing ever happens nowadays.
There was a place called Happy Valley.
Now, it was called Happy Valley... because everyone who lived there was happy.
- No! Well, there's a hunk of logic for you.
- Are you listening, Mortimer?
- Uh, Happy Valley?
- That's right, yes.
Now just try and imagine it. Can't you just close your eyes and see it?
Well, I can't see very good with my eyes closed.
My eyelids get in the way.
- You create a picture in your mind's eye.
- Oh.
That's not easy for him.
His mind gets in the way.
- Now try and paint a mental picture.
- Yeah.
I... I painted a barn once, I did.
- Well, that's very interesting.
- Yeah.
- It was... It was a red barn. It was. Yeah.
- Well, forget the barn.
- Yeah.
- And try and picture Happy Valley.
- Well, I'll... I'll work on it.
- That's the spirit.
Yeah. Yeah. I'll work on it.
Let's see, uh... Let's see, now.
It's, uh... Oh, let's say it's about, uh...
Uh, what was the question?
- Happy Valley.
- Oh, yeah! Yeah. That's right. Yeah.
- Let's see, uh...
- Think hard!
Yeah.
Let's see, uh...
Oh, I'm tired. All that work for nothin'.
- Can I try?
- Certainly.
Yes. I think I can see it, Mr. Bergen.
It's beautiful.
Yes, it was one of nature's garden spots, nestled among the green, rolling hills.
Can't you see the lovely brook as it flows through the valley?
Mmm. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The winding roads, lined with stately trees.
Trees. Yeah.
Lush fields and prosperous farms dot the landscape.
L-Landscape. Yeah.
And high on a hilltop overlooking the valley,
- shining like a jewel, stands...
- My red barn.
No, no. It was something much nicer.
- It was a majestic castle!
- Oh, that's pretty.
And something very precious is kept within these castle walls.
- My
- What is it?
It's a magic, singing harp. Listen.
What a happy day
What a sunny sky, kind of makes you sigh in a happy way
What a very merry day
All the world is gay
When your cares are light and your heart takes flight
And you're swept away
The air is sweet with clover
The clouds are turning over
Oh, yes
They're turning over
Just to show their silver lining
My, what a happy day
Never knew such bliss
Never read of this
In a book or play
What a lovely day
What a great big gorgeous, sumptuous thumping, bumptious
Hum-galumptious simply scrumptious
My, what a happy day
M-M-My, what a happy day
Never knew such bliss
Never read of this in a book or play
What a lovely day
What a great big gorgeous, sumptuous thumping, bumptious
Hum-galumptious simply scrumptious
Oh, my, oh, my
What a happy
Day
Yes, the voice of this golden harp... cast a magic spell of joy and prosperity over the valley.
- But it was too good to last...
- I knew there was a catch in it.
- for one day...
- They built a schoolhouse.
No, no. One day a mysterious shadow crept over the valley.
And then something dreadful happened!
Aaaaaah!
What happened?
When the shadow lifted, the golden harp was gone.
No longer was the valley happy, for without the magic of the harp, all was misery, misery, misery.
Just like the eighth grade.
Desolation spread over the land.
Everything was drying up.
- Dry rot.
- Yes, isn't it?
- Charlie.
- Yes, sir.
The fields of golden corn turned to dust.
Kerplop.
The laughing brook flowed no more.
To think that this was once Happy Valley!
Now it's Gruesome Gulch.
Days pass, weeks pass.
I pass. New deal.
What happened to all the people?
Well, suppose we look in on these humble peasants.
- Is that a peasant?
- That's a cow, stupid.
Well, at least they had milk.
Well, she used to be a good milker. But now...
She's an udder failure.
She was the bosom friend of a once-proud family.
Well, they're certainly out of the high rent district.
And there they are, three poor farmers, gripped by the pangs of starvation.
Still alive, still breathing, sharing a pitiful crust between them.
Share and share alike.
Sharing and staring.
Staring and sharing.
Uh, just tell it, don't ham it.
But are their spirits broken?
Have they lost hope?
Yes. Men facing famine, naught left but beans.
Ahem. Bean, you mean.
If it were one man and three beans...
But, no. One bean and three men.
Well, at least there are no bones in it.
Just look at that miserable creature, doggedly struggling to maintain life, a gaunt, lean bag of bones and feathers.
Truly a picture of despair.
But Donald doesn't whimper.
- Donald doesn't give up.
- Shut up!
I can't stand it!
Easy, Donald. Easy!
There. There, now.
There. Easy, Donald.
I... I'll be all right.
Yeah. I'll be all right.
I'll be all right.
He says he's all right, but I wonder.
He's suffered too much.
What diabolical thought is being hatched in the fevered brain... of this poor, demented duck?
Donald! No! No!
Nice bossy, bossy.
- Nice old cowsy wowsy.
- Donald!
Donald! No, Donald!
Give it here! Let me...
I just gotta eat.
I'm so... hungry.
The little fellow was completely out of his head.
- Cut it out, will ya? I get the idea!
- He was a pitiful sight.
- Weeks without food. Poor Donald.
- Yeah, poor me!
It was all they could do to restrain him.
You see, he had just about reached...
- the end of his rope.
- Yeah.
Oh, it was a sorry predicament indeed.
What to do? What to do?
Well, Donald may be nuts, but he's got the right idea. Kill the cow.
Oh, no, Charlie! The cow was their best friend.
Well, a friend in need is a friend indeed.
- So what?
- So, they need some steak.
No! If you're gonna kill the cow,
I don't wanna hear the rest of the story.
Well, she wouldn't have to know.
They could sneak up on her and surprise her. Yeah, that's what we'll do.
- We'll kill the cow.
- Oh, no, Charlie. You mustn't.
We'll get a stranglehold on her while she's asleep.
- a-a-and then push her off the cliff.
- Oh, no!
I ain't a-gonna listen to the story.
Well, it'll be your fault if they starve to death.
- Why don't they sell the cow?
- That's just what they did.
Well, why didn't you say so in the first place, and save a lot of time?
I could save a lot of time by not telling the story at all!
Your idea is not without merit.
Well, back to the scene of desolation.
Things are beginning to look much brighter now, because as Mickey goes to the village to sell the cow, the thought of prosperity... brings new hope to the famished farmers.
Even Donald has fully recovered, for soon their long-empty plates... will overflow with food.
Hey, look! Turkey, lobster sweet potato pie
Pancakes piled up 'til they reach the sky
Wa-wa, wa-wa, wa-wa, wa-wa
Wa-wa, wa-wa, wa-wa, wa-wa
Oh-h-h-h
I wanna eat and eat and eat and eat
And eat until I die
Turkey, lobster sweet potato pie
Pancakes piled up 'til they reach the sky
Lots of starches
Lots of greens
Fancy chocolate-covered...
- Beans!
- What d'you mean, beans?
Yeah, fellows. I sold the cow for some magic beans!
Beans!
But Donald!
These are not ordinary beans!
They're magic beans!
If you plant these beans in the light of a full moon, do you know what'll happen?
Yes! We get more beans!
- No, no, Donald!
- Magic beans! Phooey!
Poor Mickey, cheated into trading his cow for a handful of beans.
Tsk, tsk, tsk. What a mean trick!
Swindling an innocent farmer out of all he owned... and lying to him, telling him that the beans were magic.
Planted in the light of a full moon!
What a shame to deceive a simple little peasant.
Magic beans, indeed!
- Light of a full moon.
- Bergen? Oh, Bergen!
- What?
- There's something moving.
Why, yes. Well, maybe there is some magic in them!
All right, now let's all keep quiet and see what happens.
Mmm.
And all through the night, it grew, onward and upward.
That thing is a menace to aviation.
And so, with the coming of dawn, we find the bewildered farmers staring at a mammoth castle, miles above the earth.
Their curiosity was aroused, nothing could hold them back.
Who lives there? Man or monster?
Friend or foe?
A princess or a dragon?
Well, search me.
What drew them toward this place of mystery?
Hunger? Desperation?
Or perhaps it was love of adventure.
What a fantastic experience, perhaps mortal man... has never before set foot on this strange land.
- Well, somebody did.
- Oh, gosh! Who made them?
Well, it wasn't Cinderella.
Soon they reached the moat surrounding the castle.
But this didn't stop them. On they went, as if drawn by some irresistible force.
And then, suddenly, without warning, out of the sky above...
Ooh, dragonflies!
Yeah. A-flyin' front and draggin' behind.
- Gee, what whoppers!
- Yeah. Bombers!
Come back and fight!
Finally, they reached the castle.
The hard way.
This was the biggest adventure of their lives.
Forgotten was their hunger, forgotten was their fear.
It took courage to scale these massive steps, to make this journey into the unknown.
But these stouthearted lads never faltered.
Three minds with but a single thought.:
What mystery lurked within those cold, forbidding walls?
What strange spell hovered over this gloomy place?
Will no one answer?
Are they walking into a trap?
Do they go in?
You know, you could stand some rehearsal on this story.
Inside, the tremendous hall was as silent as a tomb.
Not a sign of life anywhere.
Caught with his pants...
- Charlie!
- Caught with his pants...
- Charlie!
- Well, his slip was showing.
They gazed in speechless wonder, almost afraid to breathe.
Suddenly they looked up.
What was it?
Food! Yum, yum, yum, yum!
Let me at it!
Oh! Who's there? Who is it?
- That's the harp!
- Boy, oh, boy!
How'd you get here?
I was kidnapped by that wicked giant!
- Oh. A... A giant!
- A giant!
- A giant?
- A giant!
- Bigger than 40 men.
- Oh, no!
An ogre who had the power to turn himself into anything, man or beast.
That calls for a drink.
It was this heartless monster that swooped down under cover of darkness, carried off the golden harp and...
- brought ruin to Happy Valley.
- No!
Ohh!
Ohh!
- I'm a giant.
- You are not.
- You're nothing of the kind.
- Well, I'm a small giant.
- No, you're not.
- I'm, uh... I'm tougher than 40 men.
- You're not.
- Well... uh, 20 men.
- No.
- No? Ten men?
Aren't you ashamed of yourself,
Charlie? Why do you act like that?
I don't know. I guess it's just a stage I'm goin' through.
- Well, take off that moustache.
- Yeow!
Now go over there and behave yourself.
Yes, sir. Everything I do is wrong.
But why did the giant want to steal the harp?
Because he was cruel and selfish. He didn't care what happened to the valley.
He just wanted someone to sing him to sleep.
Well, why didn't he turn on the radio?
Well, they didn't have radios in those days.
Yeah. That's why they called it Happy Valley.
- What did the giant look like?
- Well, he was...
Oh... I'll try and show you.
He looked something like this.
Ha. Looks like my pig Smedley.
Never mind the self-portraits. Ha-ha.
Well, no, that isn't right.
He... He looked more like... more like this.
There he is now. And the giant came home for dinner, roaring...
- Drunk.
- I was not!
- I mean, he was not.
- No.
Down the castle hall he came, roaring...
Fe, fi, fo, fum!
Fe, fi, fo, fum!
Fe, fi, fo, fum
He, hi, ho, hum
I'm a most amazing guy
A most amazing guy am I
Fe, fi, fo, fum
He, hi, ho, hum
I'm the stuff, I'm tellin' you for here's what I can do
I can change myself into an elf
Fly up high like the birdies
I can disappear into atmosphere
Peekaboo. 'Cause I know the magic wordies
Fi, fo, fe, foy
Fe, fe, fe, fe
Fifi? I don't know no Fifi.
Those are his magic words, you know.
Fe, fi, fo, fum.
- I smell...
- You're telling us!
Wait. He may be smarter than he looks.
Oh, I hope he doesn't find them.
Hey, Giant, you're getting warm.
Well, don't tell him!
- Behind the jar, stupid.
- Charlie!
Pot roast! Chocolate pot roast!
With stispacio...
With dismashmee...
With dismash...
With green gravy.
Feedy, fidey, fodey, fum!
Gesundheit.
Oh, no, you don't! You can't get away from Willie.
I gotcha!
I think I gotcha.
Yeah, I gotcha.
Willie.
What?
He'll have to talk fast to get out of this one.
Well, you leave it to Mickey. Just watch.
Ten, twenty, thirty, forty.
Boy, what a life line!
But what's this here?
What is it? What is it!
Uh-oh! I can't believe it!
- Is it bad?
- Why, i-it says here... that you can change yourself into anything!
Sure, sure! You wanna see me?
I can change myself into the darndest things!
Go on, gimme somethin'.
- Anything!
- Anything?
Anything.
See? Mickey never misses a trick.
- He's got a good idea.
- Well, uh...
Can you change into a fly?
A cute, teeny-weeny, itsy-bitsy housefly?
That's it. A housefly.
Aw, you don't want a fly.
How about a bunny with long, pink ears?
Ha. Well, of course, if you can't do a fly, why, uh...
All right. A fly.
- Why?
- Well, they're, uh...
- Because.
- Okay.
A teeny-weeny fly.
With pink wings.
Now for the magic wordies.
Fe, fi, fo, fum
He, hi, ho, hum
I'm a most amazing guy
Te, ti, te, ti, te, ti
You sure you don't want a pink bunny?
Hey, what is this?
You think you fool Willie.
Yeah, a couple more good ideas like that and they're finished.
Well, I'll admit the little fellows are in a bad fix.
But Mickey isn't one to give up without a struggle.
And with a little luck, they may still pull through.
This isn't the first time
Mickey's been in a tight spot.
Anybody wanna buy a tall, thin mouse?
No, thank you. Uh, I mean no.
Yes, things look pretty dark for the prisoners.
Looks like their goose is cooked.
Oh, Fate may yet deal them a winning hand.
Don't forget, there's still the magic harp. She knows the giant's weakness.
She could be my weakness.
There might still be a chance of escape... if she could only use her magic voice to put the giant to sleep.
If she can't, I know who can.
Shh. Let's all be quiet now, and see.
In my favorite dream
Everyone is so delightful
No one's mean or spiteful
In my favorite dream
Yes, and in my favorite dream
There my heart can go romancing
Dancing to a heavenly theme
But there's something else
I look forward to
It's a secret
But here's a clue
He's my favorite
You know who
You're the hero of
My most favorite
Dream
Oh, mercy. Forgive us.
In his right vest pocket
You'll find the key
The right vest pocket
Go carefully
Oh!
Ah... Ah... Ah...
I'll smash... Ah... I'll smash...
Ah... Ah... Ah...
Ah... Ah... Ah... Ah...
Ah... Ah... Ah...
Where is he?
Hello?
Nightmare.
Oh, boy.
- He made it!
- He did?
- Here he comes with the key!
- Let me have it, Mickey!
Well, it looks like success at last.
Free from the clutches of that terrible monster.
And now to find the beanstalk, climb down and return home in triumph, with a big surprise for Happy Valley.
But wait. Mickey's going to make doubly sure.
He's taking no chances.
Just in case the giant might wake up.
Oh!
Ha. Should have left well enough alone.
Come back here! Come back here!
And there goes the giant!
He's helpless now, tumbling over and over and over, down, down, down, down.
And so with the passing of the wicked giant,
Happy Valley echoed once again with song and laughter.
For with the return of the magic harp, peace and prosperity reigned throughout the land.
- And the people of the valley...
- We know.
Lived happily ever after.
You're a wonderful storyteller,
Mr. Bergen. Isn't he, Charlie?
Simply thrilling.
You're even better than the old-fashioned sleeping pill.
What's the matter, Mortimer?
Oh, the poor giant got killed, that he did.
- I don't like them sad endings.
- Oh, now, you don't understand.
W-Willie was a nice giant, he was.
He just got too big for his britches.
- But you don't understand.
- No, don't touch me.
I'll be all right.
Oh, excuse me.
What I'm trying to explain,
Mortimer, is that Willie the Giant...
- didn't actually exist.
- No?
No. He's a metaphysical phenomenon of your subconscious mind, a phantasmagoria of your mental faculties.
Yeah?
In other words, just a figment of your imagination.
- No!
- Yes.
So there's nothing to be upset about.
Hey! Has anybody seen anything... of a teensy-weensy little mouse?
No. I-I-I, uh...
Oh, Mr. Bergen!
Bergen, speak to me. Speak to me.
What's the matter with him?
Somethin' he ate?
Uh, no. It's, uh...
It's a fig, uh, fig... fig-a-mentation of his imagination.
- No!
- Yeah.
Well, uh, good night, Willie.
Uh, don't slam the roof.
You might wake Mr. Bergen.
Now some folks don't believe in giants
Castles up above
And others say that bears don't talk
And never fall in love
If you really wanna find
Happiness
Peace of mind
Believe in all your dreams
And you will see
You'll be full of fun and fancy
Free and full of fun
And fancy-free
Good day madame Chopin.
- Good day Monsieur Chopin.
- Good day, Professor.
- Good day, Isabelle.
- Good day.
Here's a pupil for you this morning, he's superb, he's superb.
- And how's Madame?
- The same thank you.
And how is little Isabelle this fine day?
Very well, thank you.
But it isn't a fine day, it's raining.
And what are you doing in this straw hat and slippers?
But only yesterday the sun was shining.
Who can keep track of all these changes in the weather?
From Paris this morning, who sent it?
Louis Pleyel, who's he? Let me ask.
Who owns the finest concert hall, the greatest publishing house in Paris?
Monsieur Pleyel.
Who was it when he was traveling through Germany 15 years ago.
Heard me play in the trio and shook my hand warmly and said... my dear friend, you were magnificent, I shall never forget you.
Monsieur Pleyel.
And now, who takes the time in far away Paris... to send an important letter to
Professor Elsner of Warsaw, Poland?
Who?
- Monsieur Pleyel.
- Monsieur Ple...
Yes.
Listen.
Listen.
My dear Professor Elsner, thank you for your letter... concerning the exceptional talent of your pupil Frederic Chopin.
If the young pianist should ever find himself in Paris... we shall be pleased to give him a hearing.
Respectfully, Henri Dupont.
Secretary to Louis Pleyel.
Well...
Frederic in Paris?
Naturally.
For the past year I said to myself
Joseph I said This gifted boy must be shown to the world.
The world is Paris, Paris is
Pleyel and Pleyel is your friend.
Well, here's the answer.
My dear Professor, Frederic is a little boy, how could he...
My dear Madame, in Paris last month... a young pianist by the name of Franz Liszt made his debut.
And he is 13 years old.
Frederic is only 11.
Well...
What about that little question of money Professor?
- Money?
- For his trip to Paris. Yes.
From my teaching of French, we're scarcely alive as it is.
Oh, yes. Money.
In fact, when did we last pay you for a lesson Professor?
I refuse to fill my head with trifles madame.
And that is final.
I didn't say go to
Paris tomorrow or next week but I do say let us plan for it and save for it.
There's a boy waiting to be heard.
And here is Paris, waiting to hear him.
Someday, those two facts must come together madame.
I insist upon it.
Such tones form a piano.
Mozart, as it should be played.
The brilliance, the ease, the tech...
Isabelle.
Frederic.
Frederic.
More Polish prisoners.
The Tsar is taking them to Siberia.
Let's hope Freddie.
And what about our lesson today?
Come now.
You don't understand, Professor.
I don't understand. What?
You are not a Pole. You are German.
So?
I cannot understand Siberia and freedom?
My dear boy, music and freedom are like one.
They both belong to the world.
A real artist wants freedom in every country.
Poland too?
Who'll listen to him?
Of course Poland.
You mean you would even help?
Help. What do you mean help?
Well, I've been talking to Jan and Titus.
When we grow up, all the boys are going to help.
Then put down the name, Joseph Elsner.
He's with you.
- Thank you.
- Professor Joseph Elsner.
We have secret meetings. Will you come?
- A pleasure my boy.
- But don't tell father, he'd worry.
I know.
I know very well.
Alright boy, let's start.
One more time please.
Is that Mozart?
No. That's Frederic Chopin. I wrote it.
Oh, you're composing now.
- Mozart isn't good enough.
- It's a waltz.
I'm glad you told me.
I would never know.
- Don't you like it?
- Off hand, not at all.
But how can I tell until I hear it.
Go ahead.
I think it's very nice.
I'll decide that please.
For a little boy, it's not bad.
It's feeling rather.
In fact, a fair talent for composition.
A distinct gift.
In fact...
That phrase was wrong.
Very ugly.
I like it that way.
Oh, you do?
You will please never say you like it, when you're Professor says it is wrong.
Here, I'll show you.
Such a stubborn little boy.
Here.
Alright, all right, if you want to be stubborn, go ahead.
Beautiful.
Frederic.
Do you know what a wonderful city Paris is?
Where all the great musicians and artists and writers are.
Yes, Professor.
Imagine playing there.
And a 1000 people are shouting
Bravo, Frederic.
Do you know what they would say then?
What?
They would say this Frederic Chopin is Polish.
His people ought to be free.
Why don't we see to it?
Do you understand what I mean, Frederic?
What a way that would be to help.
What a way?
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon, Professor.
Lovely day.
And you're wearing over-shoes.
Oh, you never know. It may start to rain.
A new dress?
Tonight, for Frederic's concert at Count Wyszynka's.
Don't tell me you've forgotten that?
No, no, no, certainly not.
Frederic is honored.
He would play for the Count and his guests while they platter with knives and forks and stuff their stomachs.
And you my dear friends will be allowed to stand in the pantry and peek through a crack.
And for such privileges
Madame, you go to this trouble.
People will see us coming and going Professor.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
- Ah Monsieur.
- Good day, Professor.
Will he play well tonight, you think?
Too well for Count Wyszynka.
Professor, if the count is pleased, he may decide tonight.
Frederic will be named to teach at the conservatory.
Fine place to bury a genius.
It would mean everything to us.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
It doesn't help matters to talk that way to Frederic about it.
Me?
Well, then Tsar is thinking about revolution.
- You actually mean...
- Calm, Professor, I know very well.
He's been seen with that crowd of young firebrands, Jan and Titus...
And that girl Constantia. All of them.
He's been going to secret meeting.
You don't say.
You didn't know of course.
Me?
I merely teach music.
Hands like Frederic's were not meant to carry guns.
I agree Monsieur.
The best way to serve his people would be to become great in his own profession.
My very words. My very words madame.
If if Frederic could find himself in places like...
Paris again?
Again?
When did I last mention Paris?
A week ago.
There you are, seven days.
By the way Monsieur, my small savings would be sufficient.
Excuse me. I have no time today for Paris.
Monsieur, one moment.
I think Frederic should practice on my piano for an hour or two before the concert.
It's slightly different, slightly better.
It would make him more relaxed, more confident.
I suggest he come with me now and stay through dinner.
We can meet with all of us at the
Counts in the pantry at the correct time.
- If you think so, very well.
- Thank you. Thank you.
Well, lovely dress.
Lovely day.
What's this you're playing?
When did you do that?
- I am the idiot.
- I see.
Well then. Let's listen a bit.
It's actually not bad. It's distinguished.
And its scene is magnificent.
What am I but the reflection of my teacher.
Of course. Naturally.
Liar.
Well, did you see Titus and Jan?
They're meeting us tonight.
- The Russian arrived? Is he going to speak?
- Yes. Yes.
- What am I going to do?
- You'll be there.
With this concert to give?
They'll start the meeting earlier, just for you.
Then if we leave punctually at 9.00 we'll be just in time at the Counts.
Father and mother won't let me out of this.
Also arranged.
- You're coming to my house, now.
- But...
To relax.
Professor, you are a remarkable man.
What have I been telling you?
- Come, get dressed.
- Yes.
- Oh, mama. How elegant.
- Not too far, Isabelle.
Look at the time.
Not here yet?
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?
Maestro Paganini plays next, then your son.
Where are they? Where are they.
Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
You want those rights too. So do my people.
We have that one hope in common.
Yet they tell us that the Polish people and the Russian people are enemies.
Not the tyrants of both people, however, the little army of leeches under the Tsar.
They aren't enemies at all.
In fact, they get along quite well together.
Strange, isn't it?
Tyrants must've something in common too, to teach our peoples to hate each other.
Giving us less time to think about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
'Cos if we should ever seize those rights, how awkward for the leeches?
The weapons in this fight are printing presses and fiery guts.
And they need money to buy them both.
You promise to be very troublesome to the Tsar.
In fact, in the interest of added safety he has thought it wise to send you a new governor of Poland.
A man with a bloody record.
The most efficient hangman he could find.
This hangman is on his way to Poland now.
His purpose is to hunt down meetings such as this.
He will set spies among you.
He will lay traps.
We're late.
I'm sorry, we must go.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
What would've happened if
I didn't remember things?
- Where have you been?
- I'm sorry Father.
Frederic.
Well?
You simply cannot get that boy away from the piano.
Look at him. How can he possibly play at such a state?
Frederic, it's Paganini playing.
Well, at last.
Be ready please.
Chopin.
Bravo Frederic. Bravo.
Bravo.
Encore. Encore.
Your Excellency, we thought the roads would prevent you arriving tonight.
May I present to you, his Excellency.
The Governor General Of Poland.
Newly appointed by his majesty, the Tsar.
A place for his Excellency.
- Please continue.
- Yes, yes. Continue.
You young man, continue.
Well, we are waiting.
I do not play before Tsarist butchers.
What did you gain by it?
Tell me.
What could you have hoped to gain by it?
Frederic will never teach at the conservatory now.
That is certain.
And I hope that is all, Professor.
I hope the punishment stops there.
Frederic.
Why did you do it?
Well, what are you waiting for?
There'll be an order for you arrest by morning.
- Get out of this house, Frederic.
- Out of the country?
Out of the country?
Where?
Where would he go?
Why not Paris?
- I hate to leave like this.
- You must Frederic.
Perhaps, the professor is right.
Perhaps, he's always been right about Paris.
- I have no heart for it.
- Try Frederic, try. And don't forget us.
Constantia.
Frederic.
This is Polish earth, Frederic, and don't ever forget it.
Frederic.
Pleyel.
Pleyel.
We should've stopped to clean up first.
Waste time to clean up? My boy, we're here.
Yes Monsieur.
Yes Monsieur.
Monsieur Pleyel please.
Monsieur Pleyel?
None other sir. We wish to see him.
- Tell him Professor Els...
- One moment please.
What's the matter with him?
He doesn't let me finish.
- Professor, don't you think...
- Quickly, your manuscripts.
Take them out. Where are they?
For immediate publication.
We should be ready with half a dozen of the best.
What is it you wish to see
Monsieur Pleyel about?
What is it. I wish to...
- You, you are not Monsieur Pleyel?
- No.
Of course, eh. I know Monsieur Pleyel.
- Who are you?
- Henri Dupont.
- Dupont.
- Yeah.
Ah, Dupont. His secretary.
Delighted, delighted.
Frederic Monsieur Dupont.
- Is Monsieur Pleyel in?
- Yes but...
Well, then tell him. No, no, don't say a word, we'll surprise him.
- Come Freddie.
- Monsieur, he's extremely busy.
- Ah but when he knows we're here.
- Could you please wait?
Monsieur, I ask you please.
Pleyel.
How are you, my dear friend?
Why, you look wonderful. Simply wonderful.
How glad I am to see you.
Well, I brought in Frederic.
Frederic.
Come in, come in. What's the matter with you?
There. There he is. As good as my word.
This is Monsieur Pleyel.
Shake his hand, Frederic.
How do you do Monsieur?
- Frederic...
- Chopin.
Chopin. Chopin.
You must excuse our appearance.
We rushed out from the coach to you.
You can understand that, my dear Louis.
Yes. Yes.
Must be quite a journey.
Indeed. Warsaw to Paris is no stones throw.
You're surprised. You gave us up, I imagine.
Gave you up?
Well, then, to be frank...
My dear friend, when Joseph Elsner writes he's coming, you can count on it.
What? Wrote?
Your letter must've been lost.
No. No. You answered me here.
Let me show you.
You see.
You remember.
I'm, I'm afraid it was some time ago...
Well, I'm aware it wasn't yesterday.
But after all, how long was it?
- Just 11 years Monsieur.
- Really?
Well, how time flies.
Well, let us not waste any more time.
You'd like to hear him of course.
I know it's just a formality.
Sit down, Frederic.
Monsieur, I'm an extremely busy man.
Naturally, so don't keep
Monsieur Pleyel waiting.
- Especially after 11 years.
- That's what I mean.
Go ahead. Sit down. One moment please.
- Perhaps another time, Professor.
- Now.
- Professor Elsner.
- Yes.
I must inform you regretfully that a concert for this young man under my auspices is out of the question.
Why?
Because, because for one thing.
Pleyel Hall is taken solidly for indefinitely in the future.
I expected that.
But when an exceptional artist appears you merely move everybody down one and you make a place.
Oh, you do eh?
If you were only a pianist.
But you would want to publish his music too.
Now where is he?
Believe me, his compositions are geniuses.
My dear sir. Genius sells three for a franc for every street corner in Paris.
What?
I, I don't understand.
I speak very plainly Monsieur.
- Come Professor.
- But...
But your letter.
He was then what they call an infant prodigy.
There might have been interest if you had brought him to me then.
But infants have a tendency to grow up.
And the prodigy becomes more prodigious.
Out of the question. Out of the question.
Professor, there are other auspices in Paris.
The best is Louis Pleyel.
I insist on Louis Pleyel.
I will accept nothing less.
Monsieur Pleyel, Franz Liszt.
My music.
Monsieur Liszt.
- Maestro.
- Ah, Pleyel.
Who wrote this?
This?
Dupont, who wrote this?
Monsieur...
I don't know.
Excellent.
Ah, the composer.
You do me a great honor Monsieur Liszt.
What do you call this?
Polonaise. It isn't finished.
Polonaise.
Spirit of Pole.
Magnificent.
Thank you Monsieur.
And you play it with spirit too.
As I am a patriot,
I should like to shake your hand.
I don't want to stop.
If I play the melody and you play the bass, we shall each have a free hand.
I'm in.
Monsieur Elsner, could he be ready in two weeks time?
Pardon me?
I said, could Monsieur Chopin, get a concert ready in two weeks?
You'll actually give him a...
A concert. Yes.
Isn't that what you came to Paris for?
What a city.
People not only look good, they smell good.
Let's go back to our rooms.
Eight hours practicing for one day is enough.
Relax.
You know where we're having dinner?
The most distinguished restaurant in Paris.
Celebrities at every table.
So, I reserved the table for another celebrity. Look.
On the walls, Frederic.
Victor Hugo.
Alexandre Dumas.
Liszt.
Balzac.
Balzac.
Pardon me.
Look.
The table reserved for Frederic Chopin.
Chopin.
Chopin. The great Polish pianist.
This way Monsieur.
Chopin.
- Ah, you know, Chopin?
- Never heard of him.
Never, never heard of the foremost figure in music?
Well, that's a confession of ignorance sir.
- Indeed.
- Indeed.
Why in Warsaw the public went mad about him.
On one occasion the famous critic Kalkbrenner heard him,
- and simply raved.
- I don't believe it.
An ignoramus wouldn't.
If you would aspire to culture sir, go quickly and get your tickets for tomorrow night's concert.
It will be a positive sell out.
How do you do Mr Kalkbrenner?
Now, Professor, what's the matter with you?
Little advertising never hurt.
Balzac.
What a world.
Believe me, those fellows knew a thing or two about advertising.
Come on, smile for a change. Relax.
What you? What you doing?
Something on the Polonaise.
This is not the way to relax.
Not the time for Polish themes. I said Relax.
You know who else comes here?
The great newspaper critics.
That fellow there is from Le Figaro.
And there's Le National.
Back there is Le Temps. Le Temps.
Oh. You made the rounds of the newspapers today.
Soup.
- Very, very hot.
- Yes Monsieur.
You said you wouldn't.
I just dropped in for a moment.
Where's the harm?
Haven't you said that,
A real artist would get to the top, sooner or later, by his own efforts.
But, why later? It can be sooner.
- What am I going to do with you?
- Or without me.
One critic I missed.
The most important one. Kalkbrenner.
They say he's a dyspeptic rascal.
But I'll know how to handle him.
I'll be very charming.
You know, I can be charming.
Ah. Chopin.
And the Professor.
George, let me introduce Frederic Chopin.
I told you about him and Professor Elsner.
Joseph Elsner.
George Sand and Alfred DeMusset.
I hope you like Paris Monsieur Chopin.
I'm sure Paris will like you.
Tomorrow night. I'll be there.
George Sand.
And The one with his nose in the air?
Alfred DeMusset. Great poet.
Yeah, he's sure of it.
Sand.
Sand?
Novelist, one of the finest in France.
Remarkable city Paris.
His voice was peculiar.
He is a woman, Professor.
- What?
- A woman.
The man is the woman.
Little unusual, isn't it?
How do you know?
Ah, well...
I read just one of her books, it's the story of her own life.
And does she say why,
I mean, does he say why she...
Why does she wear pants?
Well, she was afraid...
They wouldn't take a woman writer seriously, so she decided to take a man's name.
And from there drifted into pants.-
Remarkable city Paris. Eat, Frederic.
And what will you have next Monsieur?
Ah, let's see, the menu, it's gone.
The one with your music cords.
Where's the menu that was here?
I'm sorry Monsieur. I took it away.
- Away. Where?
- I'll get you another one.
It doesn't matter, Professor,
I remember the notes.
That's not the point.
This is a room full of artists and they are thieves.
Oh.
That's it.
Of all people.
That bilious dog gave me such an argument.
- This will be a play.
- Professor.
What kind of musical goulash is this?
If you please.
Man of your type should've nothing to do with music.
Goes without saying that your was absolutely flat.
You say that to me with my ear?
A donkey has ears but does he know music?
And for your information, this was written by that same Frederic Chopin.
I am Joseph Elsner, his teacher.
Professor Joseph Elsner.
You'll be reading about us sir.
On the contrary sir,
I'll be writing about you.
My name is Kalkbrenner.
Oh, my goodness.
Frederic.
What's the matter now?
Now, it's this collar, this, this button.
How do you get into this, without choking to death?
Help, I'm going crazy. Help me...
I'll fix it. I'll fix it.
You call this civilized?
I would tie up lunatics in a suit like this.
Look at you, not half dressed, we'll be late.
I've been dressing both of us.
Alright, all right. Take, take your time, take your time.
Be calm, be calm.
- How do you feel?
- Calm.
Well, don't worry. It'll pass over.
Imagine you're playing in your own room at home.
Pay no attention to the audience.
- There.
- There.
Well, why are you standing like this?
Have we got all night?
Mind me, Frederic, don't be nervous.
Don't be nervous.
Come in.
It's the post man, Professor.
This time of night? What's the matter?
A letter with four seals.
Four seals?
- From Warsaw.
- Sign please.
Frederic. A letter from
Warsaw with four seals.
Well, open it.
- Well, well.
- Alright, just a minute.
My dear, Professor Elsner.
- From Isabelle to you? Why to you?
- I don't know.
All of us are in good health and we send our most affectionate greetings.
I'm writing this to you so that you can use your own judgment as to telling Frederic...
Perhaps, I'd better not.
Go, on.
This very painful news.
The night of Frederic's departure...
Jan and our Russian friends were caught and imprisoned.
For aiding in Frederic's escape.
Frederic.
Late as time.
They are both dead.
They beat them to death.
Frederic.
We're not dressed yet.
We'll be late.
Jan.
Frederic, you have work tonight.
Important work.
Frederic.
Frederic.
- I'm sorry, Professor.
- Frederic.
Outrageous.
Please, he, he was terribly troubled.
This would not happen again.
I assure you it will not.
- You mean you would not consider...
- Certainly not.
I'm afraid you strongly overrated you pupil.
No, I, I've strongly overrated you.
Good Morning.
Up all ready?
Now the truth you didn't sleep?
Not very much.
How are the reviews of the concert?
Reviews? Oh, the concert.
Eh, I don't know, I haven't seen them.
That's the Polish theme.
Beautiful, Frederic, very strong.
Come on, Professor, you have every morning newspaper there.
- Oh, yes, I have...
- How are they?
Well, not bad.
Not enthusiastic...
In fact...
In fact they are the most abominable things I've ever seen.
You think they would admit that up to the time you stopped playing it was magnificent.
But, no, wait. I'll read you the prize of the lot.
By Kalkbrenner.
May his dyspepsia grow worse.
One passage here. Listen, to this.
Apart from the fact that the young man has no musical memory and exhibited the emotion of a school boy,
I would say about his playing, that he needs at least three more years of schooling, and a change of teachers.
The last dig, that's, that was for my behaviour.
And and and the...
Your Polonaise you played, you know...
You know what some idiot called that?
Barbaric.
It's a long walk back to Warsaw, Professor.
We'd better start.
Never.
You think we come to Paris after 15 years and go home after one attempt?
Never.
I refuse to walk back to Warsaw.
In fact, I couldn't.
My shoes need resoling.
This one I won't even dignify with a read.
What's this?
A genius such as this Frederic Chopin... appears only once in a hundred years.
You hear that?
A star has risen among us.
Brighter than we've ever seen.
George Sand.
The man who's a woman.
What's the difference, let him be half-goat.
Here's a talking point for Pleyel.
Here's a second concert in our pockets.
Come in.
Yes.
By a messenger.
By a messenger?
I, I don't have to sign?
- No Monsieur.
- Thank you madame Mercier.
Frederic Chopin, for you.
Yes. Well...
Well, what is it? What is it?
My dear, Chopin, it would please the Duchess of
Orleans if you and your teacher.
Would attend a reception at her home tonight.
George Sand.
The Duchess of Orleans...
How does George Sand know that...
It would please the Duchess?
Oh...
This is Frederic Chopin.
This is Joseph Elsner.
Professor Joseph Elsner.
Professor Joseph Elsner.
Oh, Frederic, I think I brought two left gloves.
Put the other one in your pocket.
- How are you my dear, Chopin?
- Monsieur Liszt.
Good evening, Professor.
This is all quite dazzling Monsieur Liszt.
Yes, I don't know what's underneath but the surface is very highly polished.
May I, steal your prodigy for a few minutes, Professor.
Certainly, certainly.
I'll get acquainted with a cup.
Madame, I bring you Monsieur Chopin.
Madame Sand.
If you'll excuse me.
I...
I wanted to thank you for everything you've done for me and for this invitation.
Not at all Monsieur Chopin, you belong here among all the other distinguished artists of Paris.
That's very gracious of you.
Might I ask a favor of you?
Of course madame.
I want you to promise me for this evening, you'll execute all my orders, completely.
And without any questions.
First order is, sit down Monsieur Chopin.
My dear Monsieur Kalkbrenner,
I promised you I would play this evening.
I deliver myself up to you.
Splendid. Splendid.
The Duke, the Duke, where is the Duke?
With your greatest permission.
Ladies and gentlemen, I present...
Ladies and gentlemen.
I have persuaded the greatest artist of our day to honor us.
If you would appear to the music room, you will hear Maestro Franz Liszt.
Your grace.
I have a request to make.
To create a proper atmosphere for the music I'm about to play.
I ask that the room be darkened.
What's going on here? The reception over?
For some people, yes.
For others, just beginning.
Oh, yes.
Well, thank you.
Beginning?
Liszt.
Liszt is playing.
But whose is it? I've never heard of him.
That my dear friend, is by my pupil Chopin.
Rather warm in here, don't you think?
Anything would sound good, played by Liszt.
Bravo.
Bravo.
Your grace.
Ladies and gentlemen, permit me.
One of the greatest artist of our time, Frederic Chopin.
And who are you to disagree with Franz Liszt?
Oh, Professor Elsner.
Could I discuss a little business matter with you?
Business? Now?
Isn't that rather vulgar?
And I want to publish Frederic's music as soon as possible.
Indeed, you better, because mark my words, sooner or later they're going to steal those melodies.
Exactly. Now you and Frederic will be at my office tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock.
- We can draw up the contract...
- Tomorrow at 10 o'clock?
Well, have to see what's on the calendar, besides...
I should like to consider this a little.
Oh, surely you're not thinking of asking for any better terms?
My dear, Louis, I can guarantee nothing.
Where's Frederic?
Leaving with Liszt and Sand, I believe.
- Oh, well.
- Gone, Joseph.
In fact, I'm afraid Paris has claimed him.
The more honor to Paris.
Can I drop you at your home in my carriage?
Oh, yes, I don't mind.
Arrived barefoot and leave in a fancy carriage.
- Pleyel, I would like to...
- I'm busy please.
Eh, what's that, Joseph?
Why I was saying, remarkable city Paris.
Remarkable.
To Frederic Chopings future.
Whatever demands to madame.
I owe it to you and to Franz Liszt.
Oh, it was a pleasure, my friend.
Though it was foolish of me to help.
You're a little too talented.
Tell me my dear, Chopin, what are your plans?
Well, to give concerts, I hope, as soon as possible.
Why so soon?
Artists must live, George.
And certain causes must live too.
I'm thinking of my people back home.
You see, there was a purpose in coming to Paris...
Ah, I thought so.
But I'm rather concerned about this, Franz.
Look at him, pale and drawn.
Now that's what purpose can do to a man.
No, I, I don't like this at all.
I suggest we take him to Nohant for a few days.
Very good idea.
And where is Nohant?
It is George's place in the country.
An entirely different world, where there are no purposes.
Will you be ready to take the early coach in the morning?
I'm afraid that is impossible.
- Wouldn't you care to go?
- Oh, yes, I would.
Well, then, why not?
Well, I feel that I should discuss a matter like this...
With the Professor?
- Yes.
- Of course.
Specially, such an important matter as a three day holiday.
I shouldn't make up my own mind about such things if I were you.
That wouldn't do at all.
It's a pity, Franz, but Monsieur Chopin won't be with us.
- I fell asleep.
- It's 5 o'clock.
And what are you doing?
Now, don't be alarmed, Professor.
I was going to wake you before I left.
Before you left?
I'm taking the early coach this morning.
Into the country to Madame Sand's place at Nohant with her and Franz Liszt.
I must still be asleep.
Just a short holiday. For a week, that's all.
But, wait, wait, we sign contracts with Pleyel this morning at 10 o'clock.
Well, a few days won't matter.
They do, Frederic.
When Monsieur Pleyel is ready, we should be there.
- I know but...
- And no but.
Please, will you listen?
Alright, Frederic, I'll listen.
But you can understand...
After all she's done for us,
I couldn't very well refuse.
I see.
So, without even discussing it with me?
Certainly in a matter like this, Professor,
I ought to be able to make one decision for myself.
I can't be tied to your apron strings forever and treated like a boy of ten.
Certainly, not.
Point is, you want to go.
Yes.
Because you're grateful, and, you find it rather fascinating besides,
I'm no connoisseur of woman with my weak eyes, but I can see that much,
I can understand anything.
But when it's a matter as important as Monsieur Pleyel...
Because you say it must be this very morning at 10 o'clock.
I simply say that when
Monsieur Pleyel is ready...
He'll be ready in a week from now.
And you can tell Madame Sand, since you must've holidays that she can wait another day.
- She's decided to leave this morning.
- I see.
And every selfish desire of the interesting Madame Sand is law.
- Why do you say that?
- Am I a child?
I have eyes.
I see trousers on a woman.
I know that the woman has a will of her own and I have ears.
I hear about her reputation,
Books that shocked the world.
And laws of conduct designed for herself, which is her own business except, when she interferes with business of Frederic Chopin and Joseph...
Bye, Professor.
Frederic.
Take care of yourself, the dampness is bad for you.
And have a good time.
Do you hear?
This melody is for you, George.
Thank you, Frederic.
It wants to say that I'm grateful.
I'll never forget these three days in Nohant.
You mean...
It was delightful.
So pleased to have known you.
George.
So pleased to know you, as long as I live.
Really?
We'll be in Paris together?
Oh, no, I'm afraid not, Frederic.
Franz and you will go back to Paris tomorrow.
I have some writing to do.
Here in Nohant?
For work, Nohant is much too close to the world.
There's an island off the coast to Spain Majorca.
That's where I am going.
But that's too far away.
I wish you could see it, Frederic.
Filled with sunlight and the moon there is incredible.
Such peace and beauty, you've never dreamt of.
I wish you could work there.
For a while.
Just a little while.
You could write miracles of music in Majorca.
Majorca.
This is where I work.
How can an artist serve a cause,
Frederic unless first he serves himself.
First you must find the best road for your talent.
And follow it in the face of anything.
What's your road, Frederic?
Playing music, concerts?
Many men can do that.
Your genius is creating music for smaller men to play.
Follow that genius, Frederic.
Or you are lost.
So is everything with it.
Work. Shut the world out.
This is what artists have been crying for down through the ages.
A place apart, away from the petty struggles of men who have no talent.
Be selfish with your genius, Frederic.
Stay here. Write music.
Send it back to Paris.
And I shall prove to you, how a billion rabble will send you BACK everlasting glory.
- Bravo.
- Beautiful, isn't it?
Yes, yes indeed.
Nocturne.
Look at the others. Every one magnificent.
Waltz. Mazurka.
Nocturne. Another nocturne.
Waltz Brillante.
Joseph, run through them.
That was all he sent?
All? Isn't this enough?
I was, I was looking for a particular work.
Oh, these must be charming.
Don't misunderstand but, this was a bigger work.
The unfinished Polonaise.
The one he and Liszt played. Here. Together.
I don't know about that, but these are magnificent.
And how they will sell.
Yes, I have no doubt.
Go on. Go through them, Joseph.
I'll take them with me.
Meanwhile, you are arranging for Frederic's concerts.
Concerts. Let him write works like these and there won't be concert halls big enough.
When he returns.
He told you he was not returning?
I, no.
- Well, why you think so?
- Well I merely, didn't he tell you?
Why, yes...
He'll return very soon.
Very soon.
Good day Monsieur.
Come in.
Ah madame Mercier.
- The matter we discussed a few days ago.
- Yes, Professor.
Alright.
Had no word yet?
I would've noticed a letter from Majorca.
So you would.
I'm afraid, I can't wait any longer,
Professor. I'll have to have these rooms.
I understand madame.
Tomorrow. Thank you very much.
Does it occur to you, that you may never hear from him?
It does not.
Only a simple old man like you would sit and wait for that young...
Be quiet.
You are addressing Joseph Elsner madame.
A great teacher of music.
As Franz Liszt will tell you.
And Frederic will be back when he is ready for a lesson.
Wherever I happen to be. Even in the Garrett.
And as for your rent, I can still teach.
And you will receive every cent of it, with a bonus for your incivility to
Frederic Chopin, the great artist.
George. Where have you been?
- Walking.
- In this rain?
You might have told me you were going.
I didn't think it mattered.
You have your own private world at the piano lately.
For example, this so called Polonaise jumble you have been playing for days.
It's merely a mood.
I thought I knew them all.
This mood is something else again.
Something that shuts me out completely.
I didn't mean to.
For all my attempts at frankness, I get... half expressed feelings and evasions.
George...
Isn't it apparent, that since these... endless rains began, that I haven't been well.
Is that all it is, Frederic?
And naturally...
I'm not in the mood for waltzes and graceful studies.
Your sure you are not aching for Paris?
For Professor Elsner and causes?
No.
In that case, you've only to make a simple decision.
George.
I only want to get out of this place.
We could go back to Nohant.
We can take Majorca back with us.
Living in the same way I taught you to live?
Yes.
No intruders, with the same contempt for what the world thinks or says.
Back in Nohant with me?
Is that what you choose?
Yes.
You certain, Frederic?
One and two and three and four.
Slow and deep and every note must dance and sing.
One, two, three, four.
Every note must dance and sing.
No, no, no, no, wait, my boy.
It's very uneven.
Maybe you sit too low, wait here.
Try this.
How's that?
I always used to do that with little boys.
I got wonderful results that way.
Now, again?
One and two and three and four.
Come in.
- Monsieur Pleyel.
- Joseph, how are you?
My dear friend.
Come in. This does me great honor.
I had enormous difficulty in finding you, Joseph.
- Oh, am very sorry.
- Oh, I don't want to interrupt.
Albert is very glad you did.
That will be all my boy. Friday Same hour.
- And practice. You hear?
- Yes, Professor.
Very nice talent. Here sit down.
Thank you, I can only stay a minute.
You might have told me you moved.
Actually, I was going to.
In another day or so.
First I wanted to establish myself.
How about a glass of wine, my dear Louis.
No, thank you. I have only a moment.
Establish yourself in a neighbourhood like this?
What is the matter with this neighbourhood?
I could recommend important pupils.
Important neighbourhood.
My dear friend.
Musical talent doesn't look for the correct neighbourhood.
A cup of tea, may be, eh?
Joseph, I came to tell you that Chopin is back.
Frederic?
When? Where, where is he?
He came back two days ago.
He is at Nohant.
Why didn't he tell me?
Oh, Elsner, you are stupid.
Where would he find me?
Still if he went to Madame
Mercier, she would tell him.
But back only two days after a long journey.
Why? What's the matter with me?
What are you doing?
I'm going to Nohant, what do you think am doing?
Perhaps you ought to write a note first.
Note. Who has time to write notes?
But you, Louis. You better see to the concert.
It's high time Frederic went to work.
Did you hear me?
- Yeah, yeah.
- And please have some wine.
No thank you.
Perhaps, I better be going.
Yes, you are right. I better be going.
Good day, my friend and thank you.
This way Monsieur.
Come in Monsieur.
How do you do madame?
You had a pleasant journey, I hope?
Yes, thank you.
You do remember me?
Professor Elsner.
I wondered.
Well. How is Frederic?
We were quite certain you had gone back to Poland, Professor.
To Poland?
No, no I assure you.
I'm right here in France.
Frederic?
You have no idea, after all this time, how this sounds to me madame.
Could you tell him am here please?
I never interrupt him when he works.
Very good rule.
I can wait.
But believe me, this is one interruption Frederic would not mind.
It is quite possible that he might.
Or let me put it this way.
He might be much happier to know you had gone back to Poland, Professor.
Pardon me madame.
I find that a very extraordinary idea.
It's very simple.
Frederic despises scenes.
In fact, he is quite cowardly about them.
And what he has to say to you, Professor, you will no doubt find unpleasant.
I would?
I would've to say that much has happened since he last saw you.
His outlook has greatly changed.
He has found his work in these surroundings.
He would like to go on living as he is living now.
If you don't mind, I would like
Frederic to tell me that himself.
As you wish.
Excuse me.
- Professor Elsner.
- Yes.
What would you say about the music, Frederic wrote in Majorca.
Why, very charming.
Is that all?
Beautiful.
I know Frederic's abilities quite well.
What is it that you want me to say exactly?
Has it made him the most talked of composer in Europe?
Yes and also talked about.
In a way I never thought to hear about Frederic.
In any case, there are other things to do now.
Things a little more serious.
In his music writing.
- And his concert work.
- Concerts are out of the question.
- Yes.
- He is too ill for that.
- Frederic?
- That is, he was ill in Majorca.
He couldn't stand the strain of concerts now.
- Well, maybe not now.
- Or any time in the future.
He hasn't the temperament for it.
Oh, how regrettable.
What with a little effort on Frederic's part,
I'm sure a suitable temperament can be found.
Especially, since these concerts have a purpose madame.
His purpose is to serve his own work.
And that purpose is best served by what he is doing now.
And your own, not too highly commendable purposes, they are also served madame.
Oh, naturally that's how you desire it.
And how Frederic desires it.
Yes, of course.
Example of your own life is... very persuasive no doubt, to one so young as Frederic.
The artist living quite apart.
Serving himself for his own greater glory and the world bringing gifts.
But, it will please not enter.
Merely set them down outside the door.
I'm sorry madame.
You are a lady of very strong will.
Used to having her way in all things.
But, I will not see you have this way with, Frederic.
- You've decided that, Professor?
- His whole life decided it.
And I shall have my way in this matter madame.
- As you are used to having?
- Where Frederic is concerned? Yes.
For twenty years, since he played his first lesson for me, since I listened to his first composition.
Since, I encouraged him take his place as the first musician of our time for a reason we both believed in.
Yes, I have had my way.
Frederic.
Frederic.
It's Joseph Elsner, Frederic.
Professor Elsner.
- How have you been?
- Fine.
- Fine, thank you. Oh, excellent.
- And the teaching?
Excellent, I have a pupil or two.
In ten more years, serious competition for you Monsieur Liszt.
I don't doubt it.
Something of Frederic's?
Oh yes, yes.
I happened to be passing and...
- Well, I enjoyed our meeting Monsieur Liszt.
- Professor...
We haven't seen you for a long time.
Monsieur Pleyel keeps me informed.
Did you know that Frederic is not well?
But, there is no danger.
- You agree there is no danger.
- Yes.
Well then, what can be wrong?
I'm very busy and Frederic is too, so...
- Well Monsieur.
- Well, he plays occasionally.
I mean, in some salon.
- Wouldn't you care to hear him?
- No, thank you.
Salons are not my circles.
- I shall see that you are invited.
- Thank you just the same.
Good day Monsieur.
Nevertheless, each time you shall be invited.
The news will undoubtedly disturb, Frederic.
This military upheaval?
A thousand miles from Paris?
I doubt it very much.
Ah, good morning, Frederic.
I'm late for my appointment, Louis.
Please forgive me.
How do you feel today, Frederic?
Just in the mood for business talk, Louis.
I haven't been sleeping well.
Find some relief from this tightness.
And I have a great deal of work to do.
Several things I have been trying to put on paper.
So, if it's nothing too important...
He brings the same old story, Frederic.
Every city in Europe will pay you a fortune for one concert appearance.
People are clamoring for you.
- You have the same old answer, Louis.
- Of course.
I realise, however, I still dream about just one concert in Paris.
Give up Monsieur Pleyel.
Frederic is heard to advantage only in the salon.
You want me to pound the piano.
Greet a lot of idiots in the gallery.
You will excuse me. I'm anxious to work.
Thank you for coming.
No, I don't believe news of Poland will upset him very much, my dear Pleyel.
Come in.
Yes?
Well?
Constantia.
Sit down.
Where did you come from?
- Monsieur Jollet, if you don't mind.
- A letter for you.
Thank you very much.
You have been so good to help.
Here, let me look at you.
When did you leave home?
You have been traveling for weeks.
What are you doing here?
Did you run away?
- No.
- No. No what?
No, I didn't run away.
You mean they sent you here.
I went to Pleyel to find out where you live.
I, well, that, that was the natural thing to do.
- What do you need?
- Nothing.
I knew I wouldn't find you with Frederic.
No, no, naturally not, I've been...
The city would be bad for him.
He needs the country.
You know he is ill.
I wrote it a thousand times.
Your letters may fool his family, Professor Elsner.
- But not us.
- Oh, I see.
I was trying to fool somebody.
Let me understand this.
The country air he needs is at
Nohant, with Madame George Sand.
Alright at Nohant.
What is the different where?
Professor, this last uprising,
I can tell you it was pitiful.
Clubs and knives against and cannons.
And our best people not there to led them.
They are in jail.
Every man who can speak or think or write or paint.
Titus, Carl all of them.
With money we can bribe many of them free.
If anything of the past, just a small spark is still alive in Frederic.
If anything is alive in Frederic.
What a preposterous statement.
He is the same boy you knew.
And I shall prove it to you, you'll see.
And I will not have him slandered.
You suppose that he could, but the man is seriously ill.
Money from the sale of music, he can live that's all.
Concerts where money is made has been out of the question.
What, what would you have him do?
Beg or steal as we would.
Use his reputation.
Gather his friends the great people of France that he lives with.
And bludgeon them for help without shame or pride.
Yes.
He could do that.
And should.
I will have a talk with him, Constantia.
Do you ever see him, Professor?
Do I ever see him?
Amazing question.
You have made up your minds to everything.
All of you.
See him. Constantly. Here.
Tonight. At the salon of the Duchess of Orleans.
Frederic will play and I am asked to attend.
Where ever Frederic plays will I please be there.
- From Franz Liszt?
- Yes, yes.
Frederic's friend. My friend.
Don't you see.
Your questions are absurd.
And of course, you'll go, Professor.
And when you see him.
Will you give him this?
Well, I...
I, I hadn't intended to go but... under the circumstances, I will.
Bravo. Bravo.
Your Grace will pardon me.
I shall continue in a moment.
You wish to see Frederic.
That is why I came madame.
Please.
Monsieur Elsner came to see you.
Good evening, Frederic.
You are more ill than I imagined.
Why did you come here tonight, Professor?
We've both been busy for quite awhile, Frederic but...
One day it was bound to be necessary, that we had a talk.
This is not the time or the place.
If it's important to Monsieur
Elsner, as it seems to be, why should you avoid it?
At any time or any place.
To save time Monsieur, since the guest are waiting.
There have been uprisings recently in Poland, Frederic.
I believe that is what the good professor came here to tell you.
I'm sorry to hear it.
Naturally.
And so is every decent thinking person.
These are the sorrows of this planet which we all regret.
They must be healed or burnt out, with time.
I beg your pardon but the struggles of people...
People who's struggle it is, Not Frederic.
Nor any man who has any obligations to his genius.
Peculiar.
How differently we once felt?
That genius is a rare gift.
So many ordinary people seem to robbed, to make one such man.
And the man worthy of the gift, should go closer to those people as it becomes more great.
Fight harder for them with that same genius.
But, what a waste of that gift.
And a man who loses all decency and honor who flowers into a selfish, isolated fop.
- Companion of a beast...
- Frederic.
We can't keep the guests waiting any longer.
One thing Freddie... it will just take a minute.
Constantia.
You remember her.
Constantia has come to Paris to ask for help.
For such men as Carl and Titus who are in prison back home.
I promised to bring her an answer.
The answer has been given.
I would help if I could.
Money.
Just money could break them free.
Isn't it clear there is nothing I can do.
Unless it's Frederic's life they want.
In my opinion madame, he is not living now.
Frederic.
Frederic.
This is where you live, Professor?
Yes, I, I know.
Well, how was the evening?
Well, charming, quite wonderful.
I think I'll walk a little.
A young lady is up there waiting for you.
Yes, I know.
Frederic, what's happened?
Forgive me for sending for you at this hour, Louis.
What is it?
Do they still ask me to appear in London, Rome Vienna?
Of course.
Then arrange such a tour in every city that wants me.
And make it pay, Louis.
Squeeze every last franc out of them.
An art you know so well.
But Frederic, are you sure of this?
The money is to go to Professor Elsner.
He will know what to do with it.
But perhaps we should discuss this further.
You must consider your health.
I want to start immediately.
Would you see to it please?
- No I...
- I'm deeply obliged to you Louis.
Isn't this rather foolish, Frederic?
You're evidently disturbed about this but...
It's childish to rush to extremes.
You can't do what is humanly impossible.
You realise that?
You realise that to make this tour is literally and actually suicide?
We'll send off to Pleyel and tell him that you've changed your mind.
It, it's late, isn't it?
It is very hard to tear myself away.
You see, we were talking...
- Until now?
- Yes. No, I walked a little...
He was terribly moved.
I can't quite tell you.
Of course, goes without saying, he'll do something. Anything.
Concerts would, of course be the answer but we have an idea how it looks.
I doubt that the concerts will be possible.
Still, he'll consider it.
- Really?
- I said he would.
If it's humanly possible.
You, you don't believe me?
You've made up your mind, eh? I'm a, I'm a liar.
Go back and slander Frederic at home.
Don't listen to me. I'm going to swear to you, Frederic is Frederic.
He's forgotten nothing. If he had an ounce of strength to give, he...
He, come in.
Joseph, I've just come from Frederic.
He's asked me to arrange a tour.
Did you hear what I said?
Frederic, on concert tour.
What's so amazing, my dear Louis,
I was just telling this young lady...
I was certain he would.
You think this is strength,
Frederic and high purpose?
I call it puling weakness.
You give your life into other people's hands, and the character you have left is what those people graciously let you have.
No one knows this human jungle better than I.
No one ever fought more bitterly to survive in it.
To have had some talent and ambition and to be a woman, in masculine eyes, something slightly better than a herd of cattle.
I buried the woman, wrote behind a man's name, wore trousers to remind them I was their equal.
Yes. And was fully as moral as they were.
No more, no less.
Maybe you think it didn't cost a woman something to do it.
Year after year, in the face of contempt and slander.
But there was the reward to remember.
I ruled my own life, and what I set out to do, I did.
You took that example and became great.
And now, if a thousand weaklings came to me to draw me into their hopeless causes, to ask me to lift their misbegotten lives with the wisdom I own,
I'd see every last one of them rotting, first.
That would be strength and dignity.
Frederic.
This is Polish earth, and don't ever forget it.
A man worthy of the gift should grow closer to those people as he becomes more great.
Fight harder for them with that same genius.
Do you realise that to make this tour is literally and actually suicide?
Encore, encore.
Bravo, bravo.
Professor...
Constantia.
The Professor?
He'll be here soon.
Franz?
He's in the next room, Frederic.
I would like to hear the piano.
Would Franz play for me?
Sorry to intrude Monsieur, but this was quite necessary.
Shall we pause for a moment?
No Mr Delacroix. Let us go on.
Yes Monsieur?
Frederic, is been asking for you madame.
He's dying.
Are you satisfied Monsieur?
Do you know anything that could replace a life as great as his?
Yes.
The spirit that he leaves behind in a million hearts madame.
Will you come to see him?
I think not.
Frederic is mistaken to want me.
I was always a mistake.
I certainly do not belong there now.
Good day Monsieur.
Continue Mr Delacroix.
Sleep.
She was too ill to come.
I understand.
You're always right.
It's better this way.
It's like coming home.
That's right, Frederic.
We're home.
The trip to Paris was wonderful.
Well...
Didn't I tell you?
Got any coffee on you?
Oh, yes?
Now I can retire.
Well, there's your good-neighbor policy.
Come on, honey.
That's good neighborin'. There we are.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, that international favorite, Tony De Marco.
You never saw a place like this in your life.
- Hello, kids. There you are.
- Hello.
I'll wait a bit on you till the other one.
- This place gives me a very uneasy feeling, A.J.
- Shame on you.
- Gimme your hat and get your mind off your wife.
- That hat's all right?
- Yes, your hat's all right.
- That's my hat.
She knows it.
Never lost one in her life.
Now, see here, A.J.
I should have been more fiirm.
When I told you that I am never seen in places like this, I meant it.
I don't know how you've managed to get me this far. I should have put my foot down.
- Don't be a square from Delaware.
Get hep to yourself.
- What kind of talk is that?
- I heard it on a jukebox.
- Well, I don't think I like it.
- I have your table, Mr. Mason.
- Thank you, Harvey. Come on, Pottsie.
Hey, Phil, do those two come here very often?
Well, I haven't seen the mortician before... but that old mountain goat in the blue serge... comes leaping in here two or three times a week.
That old mountain goat happens to be my father.
Well, you see, I like goats.
Lovely animals.
Some of my best friends are-
How about another goat- uh, beer?
No, thanks.
I think I'll horn in on the old goat.
The usual. Lemonades.
- What did you order?
- Lemonade.
How do you like Tony De Marco?
Great, isn't he?
I hope that woman's his wife, because if she's not, there should be a law.
That's a good one.
Good, eh?
A.J., look.
We have company.
- What are you doing here?
- I was about to ask you the same thing.
Well, we just dropped in for a nightcap.
- We missed the Westchester train, and Potter here suggested-
- Nothing of the kind.
- Andy, this is entirely your father's idea.
- What?
- Yes.
- Young man, I thought you had to get back to your outfiit.
Well, I do, but I didn't say when.
I've got till Monday morning.
How 'bout you?
Mrs. Potter give you a furlough too?
I promised my wife I'd be home before midnight. I like to keep my promises.
She expects me to, and I expect her to expect it.
Say, Peyton, supposing I get
Mrs. Potter on the phone...
- and explain that you and Dad just dropped in-
- Go ahead, son.
- She likes Andy, and anything he tells her will be okay.
- I'll call her, fiix everything.
- You be sure to explain to her that this is just lemonade.
- Lemonade.
- Lemonade.
And now, folks, the Club New Yorker proudly presents... its beautiful dance instructors, specially imported to teach you... that brand-new South American dance sensation, the Uncle Samba.
Our girls don't wait for leap year.
They choose their partners now.
And you don't have to wait either, gentlemen.
Look around and choose your nearest exquisite.
All right, girls.
Grab your partners and let's go.
Come on up. That's the idea. There we go.
There you are.
Hello? Hello!
Oh, hello, Andy.
Where are you?
Club New Yorker?
Oh. Potter's with you?
Dad brought him here after the dinner for a nightcap. Don't worry about him.
Don't give him anything stronger than lemonade.
The last time he had champagne was on our honeymoon. It was at Niagara.
He thought he was a barrel. He wanted me to roll over the falls with him.
I'll look after him.
Is Vivian there?
Put her on.
Hold on. I'll call her.
Oh, Vivian!
- Yes, Blossom.
- Phone, dear.
- Who is it?
- Andy.
Oh. Hello, Andy.
At the Club New Yorker?
He is?
How dare you drag my father to such a sinful place?
Tell your mother she has nothing to worry about.
My father, he's doing all right.
Say, that girl's a honey.
Who is she, Ruth?
- That's Eadie Allen, one of our new girls.
- Eadie Allen. Hmm.
Mr. Potter!
This is all your fault, A.J.
It was you who sicced that gypsy on me.
- She's no gypsy. She's a Brazilian.
- Well, whatever she is, she's a-
- She's a bombshell.
- Bombshell. That's exactly right.
Did you see that man with the camera?
Did you see that thing explode in his hands?
I was lucky to get out alive.
Now I'm gonna be fiirm. We are leaving.
Well, I talked to Mrs. Potter and everything's fiine.
- She was delighted to hear that you had taken up dancing again.
- She was?
Did you tell her about me out there dancing with that South American savage?
I knew I shouldn't have let you telephone.
I was only joking.
I told her nothing.
What I was doing out there, that wasn't Peyton Potter at all.
- Now, don't be modest. You were swell.
- Really. I've had enough.
- Mason, if you please.
- Old Pottsie can't take it.
Well, you go along with him.
I've got some unfiinished business.
Unfiinished business?
That must mean a girl.
Boy, I wish I were young again.
- Well, I'm glad you're not. Where would I be?
- Good night, Son.
Good night, Dad.
Oh, waiter.
Take a message to Phil Baker.
- Ask him to meet me at the bar between shows.
- Yes, sir.
And, waiter. Have him bring Miss Allen with him.
- There you are.
- Yes, sir. Miss Allen.
- You want to see me, Andy?
- Yes, but, well, where's Miss Allen?
Miss Allen? Oh, you see, between shows, she goes over to the Broadway Canteen.
This is her night to dance with servicemen.
- Didn't you tell her I wanted to meet her?
- She wasn't interested.
- I'm afraid you picked the wrong girl.
- Yeah?
I think I'll go over to that Broadway Canteen.
- I'm warning you, you won't get to fiirst base.
- I'm pretty good at baseball.
So was the mighty Casey, but even Casey struck out.
It'll take more than three strikes to keep me away from fiirst base.
- Fifty bucks says you go down swinging.
- I'll take that bet.
- Have you ever been in Tennessee?
- No. Is that where y'all from?
- You guessed it. And I bet
I can tell you where you're from.
- Where?
Heaven, lady.
Heaven.
Shove off, sailor.
- So long, angel.
- So long, Tennessee.
- Are you really an angel?
- The navy seems to think so.
My mom always told me, if I was a good boy, I'd see an angel someday.
You be a good boy now and watch that right hand. It's slipping.
Just lookin' for your wings, baby.
Lookin' for your wings.
- Do I really have to give you up?
- Sorry, it's the rule here.
The marines lay the groundwork, and the army takes over.
When I fiirst saw you,
I said, ''target for tonight.''
Hmm. You're not wearing them, are you?
- Not wearing what?
- Your marksmanship medals.
Ah, I wish you weren't so beautiful.
Why?
Well, then nobody would cut in, and you'd be all mine for the rest of the evening.
Have you been getting results with that line?
Aw, I'm sorry.
You're used to getting a pretty good spiel from most of these fellas I guess.
Oh, I don't mind them.
After all, they're a long way from home.
A long way from their girls.
You can't blame them if they get off the beam once in a while.
They're all pretty sweet.
Even the wise ones.
Say, would you think
I was too forward if I, uh-
If you what?
Well, if I asked you your name?
No, of course not. It's Allen.
What's yours?
- What?
- I said, ''What's your name? ''
Oh. Well, uh, it's, uh, Casey.
Casey? Hmm.
That's a pretty good name.
- ''Casey at the bat.''
- That's me.
- Huh?
- Well, I-
I mean,
I played a lot of baseball.
- Are you pretty good?
- Well, that depends.
Sometimes I, uh, don't even get to fiirst base.
- I like baseball.
- So do I.
I like dancing too.
- Huh? Oh, I'm sorry.
- That's all right.
Would you like something to eat?
- Why, yes. I guess I would.
- Doughnuts and coffee?
- If you led me to it, I'd eat hay.
- Well, come on.
May I have a couple, June?
Thank you.
There you are.
- Oh, cream and sugar?
- No, thanks.
You'll fiind those awfully good.
You can dunk if you'd like to.
- Dunk?
- Mm-hmm. Like this.
- Isn't that better?
- Yes, much better.
Here. Have another bite.
Couldn't we just talk?
I'm not awfully hungry.
Well, I have to leave pretty soon now.
I've got a show to do.
A show?
Are you an actress?
Well, not exactly.
Just a showgirl from the Club New Yorker.
- A showgirl.
- Mm-hmm.
- Gee, no wonder you're so glamorous.
- Now.
- Say, if I'm not being too forward-
- Yes?
You suppose I could walk to the club with you?
Or do you have a boyfriend?
I haven't a boyfriend. No.
- But we're not allowed to leave the canteen with soldiers.
- Oh.
And, uh, now I'm afraid
I'll have to say good night.
- Good night?
Won't I ever see you again?
Well, I'm here three nights a week.
Yes, but I won't have another leave for some time.
I'm sorry.
Best of luck, soldier.
Thanks.
- You're sweet.
- Thanks.
Well, looks like we've reached our objective.
- Good night, Casey.
- I wish you didn't have to go in.
- Good night, soldier.
- Couldn't I meet you after the show?
We could sort of go out and you could show me the town sort of. Will you?
- I'd love to.
- Really?
I'll be fiinished at 1:30.Just in time for a drink and dance at the Stork Club.
Then on to El Morocco, then just a quick look in on Monte Carlo.
After that, we'll go to Lindy's for a late bite... and then I know a swell spot on 52nd Street.
Won't cost you more than $50... that is, of course, if you don't tip too heavily.
We're gonna have lots of fun,
Sergeant.
- Those places are pretty expensive, aren't they?
- Yes, they are.
Well, I'm afraid I couldn't afford it, not on a sergeant's salary.
- Well, then what do you say we skip the whole thing?
- All right.
- Good night, soldier.
- Good night.
- Casey.
- Yeah?
Would you-Would you like to see the show?
- Gee, would I!
- I'll fiix it for you out front.
Oh, don't go to all that trouble.
I'll see it from backstage.
- Good night, Ben.
- Good night.
- Good night, Ben.
- Oh, Miss Allen...
I just had a nice talk with your boyfriend here.
Didn't know you had a sweetheart.
I, uh- I- I told him we were sweethearts.
I hope you don't mind.
Stop acting like Don Ameche, and get me a taxi.
- I've got one waiting.
- Thank you.
Let's go over by the rail.
First a taxicab, then the Staten Island Ferry.
- You certainly can pick 'em.
Well, you see, I thought it was nearer and really much cheaper than-
Any nightclub in town.
- You know, it is kind of nice to get out of the city at that.
- I'll say.
- It's beautiful out here, isn't it?
- Mm-hmm.
You're beautiful too, Eadie. I couldn't keep my eyes off you in that show tonight.
You ought to be the star instead of just one of the girls.
I won't be for long. Phil promised me a song in the new show.
Really?
I didn't know you could sing.
- Phil thinks I can.
- He's a swell guy.
You'll like him when you get to know him.
That sounds as though you're going to let me come around some more.
- Could be.
- Well, after all...
I suppose I'll have to hear you sing sometime, won't I?
Yes, I suppose you will.
Well, what are we waiting for?
All right, soldier, you win.
- Ready?
Hear the orchestra?
Yeah.
Where's it coming from?
- Where's your imagination?
Gee, that's swell.
- Did you really like it?
- You bet I did.
- Hey.
- What?
Look over there.
The evening star.
Over your left shoulder too.
That ought to mean something.
Oh, I- I forgot to tell you.
We're gonna have Benny Goodman and his orchestra in the new show.
- Oh, you are?
- Mm-hmm.
That's fiine.
I'm certainly glad
I met you tonight.
- Why?
- Oh, lots of reasons.
Do me a favor, will you?
Sing that song again.
- Oh, you don't want to hear it again.
- Oh, yes, I do.
- That sounds like an order.
- It is.
Okay, Sergeant.
- Here we are. Wait for me.
- Yes, sir.
- Well?
- Oh, no. I'm gonna take you right up to the door.
- Will I see you tomorrow night?
- I thought you had to go back to camp.
Well, I do, but you'll be at the
Grand Central Station to see me off.
I hadn't thought about it.
You'll think about it now, won't you?
Uh-huh.
- But you haven't even told me where you were going.
- Huh?
Well, I mean your camp.
Where is it?
Oh. Oh, well, uh-
- Well, that's a military secret.
- Is it north, east, south or west?
I- I can't tell you that either.
- You see, I've never been there before.
- Oh.
But from what the fellas tell me, it's really a paradise for soldiers.
- No.
- Yeah.
They say it's warm and beautiful there.
And at night, even the ocean sings you to sleep.
And the moon and the stars, why, they-
- Oh, that's swell.
- Yeah.
You'll be hearing from me the minute I get there.
My train leaves at 8:00.
I'll meet you at the information booth at 7:30.
Well, I, uh-
I don't know whether I can make it.
You see, I have a-
I have a rehearsal in- in the morning, and I don't know for how long.
Then I promised Mabel... from there I'd go to Brooklyn with her to see the Dodgers play.
I- I guess maybe I could miss seeing the Dodgers.
Won't hurt anything.
- Don't be late.
- I won't.
Remember.
Grand Central Station. 7:30.
I'll be there.
Good night.
- Good night.
Did you have a good time in town?
Well?
Vivian, I want to tell you about last night.
- You see, I-
- Andy, you don't have to explain anything to me.
I simply asked you if you had a good time.
Well, uh, yes, I did.
Well, that's all that matters.
You're a good sport, Vivian.
- But then, you've always been.
- Sure.
- You're a very lucky guy to have a girl like me.
- I know that.
However, don't think
I won't be properly jealous... if you go cruising around in that uniform... and get yourself a sweetheart in every port.
Oh, I'm a soldier, not a sailor.
A soldier can get in deep water too.
Sometimes way over his head.
I wish I could take this pool of yours back to the camp with me.
- You mean they don't have a swimming pool for you...
Or a nice man to bring you tall frosty drinks when you're thirsty?
Good afternoon.
How's the swimming today?
Super, Mrs. Potter.
Simply super.
Well, that's wonderful.
Too wonderful.
- Aren't you going in, Mrs. Potter?
- Oh, mercy, no.
The pool is Vivian's department.
I just have the towel concession.
Please. Don't rush those things back and forth too much.
These children are here to swim in the pool.
Yes, madam.
Hello, kiddies.
Have you seen the morning tabloid?
I suppose you'll show this to Dad right away and be properly outraged.
- Oh, no. I'm saving that until I need it.
Go ahead, Beezy.
Ask her.
- I will. Stop pushing.
- Well, go ahead.
- M-M-Mrs. Potter?
- Yes, my dear. What is it?
W-Would you care to dance,
Mrs. Potter?
Me? Oh, isn't that sweet of you.
Just being polite, of course.
Oh, no, he isn't.
I told him you like to dance.
Oh, I do. I love it.
But he is so young, and I am so-
Well, you know, so-so.
Oh, you embarrass me. Really, you do.
- Oh, go ahead, Mother. Beezy loves to dance.
- Yes, that's what I'm afraid of.
You know, I'm not 16 anymore.
I feel silly.
He wants to play.
Drop that.
Mrs. Potter,
I want to have a talk with you.
Come to my study at once, please.
Pass the ammunition, kiddies.
- You going to write me?
- Are those orders, Sergeant?
- I'm serious, Eadie.
- How serious?
Hearing from you every day would make me feel that you're marching... right up there with me at the head of the column.
And that's where
I want you to be, Eadie.
I will write you, Andy... every day.
All aboard. Leaving on Track 28.
Westbound Limited.
Chicago, Omaha, Denver...
Salt Lake City, Los Angeles... and San Francisco.
Westbound. All aboard.
Well, I guess that's me.
Wait a minute, Andy.
- You said you were going to Florida.
- I didn't say that, darling.
Yes, you did. You said you were going to a camp where it was warm and beautiful.
- But, Eadie, I-
- But I remember every word.
You even said the ocean would sing you to sleep.
- And the moon and the stars and-
- Well, that's right, darling.
The ocean will sing me to sleep.
And the moon and the stars-
The stars. Remember last night on the ferryboat?
- Yes.
- Well, look over your left shoulder again, will you?
- No, Andy. No.
- Please? Just for me. Just this once.
Just for good luck. Please.
Andy, you've got-Andy!
Andy!
That's the last time
I'll ever take you anyplace.
- Eadie. Well.
- Fancy seeing you here.
- Yes, isn't it fancy?
- I suppose you came down to meet our train, eh?
Yes, I did, but I was a little early.
Of course, you couldn't have been seeing a few soldiers off, by any chance.
A few soldiers?
Only one, I'll bet you. Sergeant Crazy.
It's Casey, Dorita. And what's wrong with saying good-bye to a soldier?
- Nothing.
- I call it nice works if you can get him.
- Where have you two been?
- To the cleaners.
- The cleaners?
- That's what they call the racetrack.
Dorita's never seen a race, so I took her out to Empire City.
I thought she ought to meet a few of the horses she's been supporting.
I've never seen a race myself, Dorita.
Tell me about it.
Okay, I tell you. First you pick the horses, to win, to place, to show.
Then you buy three tickets.
You sit and hold them like this.
The horse lose.
You tear up the tickets.
Then you pick three more, to win, place, show. You buy three more tickets.
You hold them.
The horse lose again. You tear them up.
More races, more tickets, more horse lose.
The day is over and what have you got?
I'll show you.
Hold this for me.
Like this, yes.
Horses.
Well, it looks like a white Christmas.
A.J., have you seen the San Francisco newspaper?
Why should I see the San Francisco newspaper?
Well, my secretary's hometown is San Francisco... and she gets the San Francisco newspaper every day.
- What's that got to do with me?
- Don't be stupid, old boy.
If it weren't her hometown, she wouldn't get the paper, would she?
And I wouldn't be able to show you this picture of your son receiving a medal.
So what? What?
Well, why didn't you say so in the fiirst place?
Look at that. Been in the South Pacifiic three months and already a hero.
Look at that. Been in the South Pacifiic three months and already a hero.
Why wasn't I told about this? Why didn't
Andy write me? Where's my mail, Miss Custer?
- Right there before you, Mr. Mason.
- Oh, so it is.
- Why were you keeping this from me?
- Why, that's a medal.
- It's a medal.
- Why, it's the same one as in the picture.
It's the same one, on a ribbon and everything. Isn't that handsome?
- Look at that.
- Oh! He's in San Francisco.
- No.
- Be home in about two weeks.
- No.
- Pottsie! My son back on American soil and a hero.
- Oh!
- Please.
- I tell you, we've got to get busy and make some plans.
- We certainly have.
Why not another stag dinner?
I had a very good time at that last one.
No, no. Right here.
Behind his name, he signs ''N.S.D.''
Yes, National Selective Draft.
You see, that's what that-
National Selective nothing.
It's N.S.D. No stag dinners.
No stag dinner, yes. Well, then a quiet little party at home. Just the two families.
He don't want a quiet little dinner.
He's young.
He wants excitement.
Why, he wants wine, girls, song!
Yes, well, there's the community sing every Thursday night. It's really-
Oh, that's so stupid, the choir.
I know what it is. His favorite spot.
The Club New Yorker.
Oh. Well, that lets me out.
Of course, he's your son. If you want-
Wait a minute, Pottsie.
I'm tied up with this board meeting... but you go right over to the Club New Yorker now and make arrangements for a party.
What are you talking about? I go to a place like that in broad daylight and by myself?
Oh, never mind. Now, come on.
Come on. I'll go with you.
Miss Custer, cancel my next appointment.
Where did you think you were goin'?
Come on, girls. Snap into it.
Put some life into it.
Close it in. Come on.
Watch your feet.
Up! That's it.
Lines. Now travel forward.
Come on. Forward. Travel!
Oh, kind of ragged, girls. Benson, I want you to set a new routine for this opening.
- Come on, Pottsie.
- Oh, A.J. -
If you're scared, hold my hand.
Mr. Baker, you remember me, Andy's father.
- Yes, indeed.
- My partner, Mr. Potter.
- Hello. And how's the sergeant?
- Well, if you're referring to my son... he's back from the Pacifiic and covered with medals.
Really? How do you like that?
Andy Mason a hero.
And that's why we're here.
He'll be home in a couple of weeks... and I want to arrange a party for him here.
That'll be fiine.
Only, the club is closed.
- We're rehearsing a new show to open in October.
- Oh, really?
In that case, Mason, I'm sure Mr. Barker here must be very busy with his chorus girls-
- Now, wait a minute.
- What's the matter?
- I've got an idea.
- It's too late, old boy.
- This time it's a real killer diller.
- A what?
Jukebox. Why don't you bring your show up to my place?
That is a ridiculous idea.
You're not well, A.J.
And it's the air in here.
I know. It's this fresh paint.
- Look, you can rehearse it there and present it at Oakwood.
- Oakwood? That's my place.
- Of course.
- What are you talking about?
That enormous terrace garden on the south slope.
We could put tables on the terrace and stage the show in the rose garden.
In my rose garden? I won't hear of such a thing. Those are my prize yellow roses.
We'll put the show on to sell war bonds.
We'll make it the biggest bond-selling drive you ever saw.
We'll charge our neighbors
$5,000 bonds for admission.
Why, we'll raise a million dollars... which would go to help Andy Mason and millions like him to get the stuff they need.
Mr. Mason, if you had a beard, you'd remind me... of my two favorite people-
Santa Claus and Uncle Sam.
Well, we'll consider everything settled.
You bring your whole troupe up for a week.
We got plenty of room for everybody, two houses. Bring 'em up for two weeks.
- Oh, be sensible. Actors for two weeks?
You couldn't feed 'em.
- Oh, now, now.
- You couldn't feed them.
- We haven't got time to be sensible.
I'll call you back later this afternoon and give you the details.
- Great.
- Oh, by the way... do you think the Brazilian bombshell will like the idea?
Well, I don't know. Why don't you ask her yourself? Here she comes now.
How do you like my new costume?
You think it'll knock their feet off, huh?
Sensational. Oh, Dorita, you remember
Mr. Potter and Mr. Mason.
I remember Mr. Potty. You are here to kick up some more heels, huh?
- No.
- Mr. Potter wants you to come to his house this weekend.
Ah-ah, you naughty boy.
You are what they call a fast-work man, yes?
- Mason, please.
- Well, it was really my idea.
We wanted you to come and help sell war bonds.
Oh. You know, I like you both.
I think you are very cute.
Phil, we're ready for Eadie Allen's number.
Okay. Why don't you boys watch the rehearsal?
I want to see what you think of it.
- Okay, Benny, here we go.
- All right, Phil.
What do you say?
How about it, Eadie?
- I'm all ready, Phil.
- All right, boys, hit the lights.
Come on, girls.
Clear the stage, everyone. Hit it, Benny.
- Wait till you hear her sing this song. It's a lulu.
Where'd you get all these station wagons?
Commandeered them from the neighbors.
I'm chairman of the transportation committee.
With Mr. Mason's $5,000 war bond admission, reservations are pouring in.
And at $200 a table, looks like a real sellout for the army and the navy.
- Say, that's wonderful.
- Did you ever saw so much flowers... and trees and shrubbers?
- Very nice, Dorita. Very nice.
- What are you do up in the dumps?
Eadie is worried because she thinks a certain soldier may be back from overseas.
Why shouldn't I worry?
He'll never fiind me out here.
The club is closed, I've left my apartment.
He won't know where I am.
I know exactly how you feel, Eadie.
I have a soldier too.
He lives right next door.
Andy Mason, Jr.
Maybe you know him.
- Andy Mason, Jr? Why, I know him well.
- You do?
Say, you're not by any chance engaged to him, are you?
Well, sort of. We've been sweethearts since I was 10 and he was 12.
- Andy's just back from Australia.
- Australia?
- Casey was in Australia.
- Really?
Wouldn't it be funny if they knew each other?
Yes, wouldn't it?
Mr. And Mrs. Potter, I want you to meet Benny Goodman and his boys.
- How do you do, Benny Goodman and boys?
- How do you do?
Go in the house.
You'll fiind everything you need.
- Walter and Edward will take care of you.
- Thank you.
Just make yourselves at home, boys and girls.
Mother, this is Eadie Allen and Dorita.
I think you've met Mr. Mason.
- Hello.
- Welcome to Oakwood, my dears.
- We're so pleased.
- Thank you.
Ah, I remember you from your pictures in the newspapers, or was it the police gazette?
- How are you?
- I'm very well to do. Thank you.
Ah, you do very well what you do do.
Now you young ladies will have the Magnolia Room. That is the room next to my daughter's.
- I'll show you up.
- I'm going to like here.
That hat. I'll have to watch my bell cords and lampshades.
Oh, Phil.
- Hello, Mr. Mason.
- Mrs. Potter, I want you to meet Phil Baker.
How do you do, Mrs. Potter?
This is a great pleasure,
Mr. Baker.
I've heard so much about you, from young Andrew especially.
I'm so happy to have you with us.
So happy.
I'm so happy to be here, Mrs. Potter.
It's lovely of you to arrange this holiday for my hardworking little troupe.
- So very lovely.
- Oh, it's nothing at all, really.
I'll leave you two to get acquainted while
I see that the boys fiind their proper rooms.
- Blossom!
- Philsy!
Blossom, you old cabbage, you.
Oh, boy, it's more like coleslaw now.
Oh, you haven't changed a bit.
I wish I could say the same for you.
- You could if you'd lie a little too.
- Do you remember Paris?
- Do I?
- Ah, Paris.
- Paris in the '20s.
- Oh, boy, were you a sensation with that accordion.
And you with your silver soprano.
What a set of pipes.
Ah, the pipes are not what they used to be.
They're a little corroded right now.
Phil, if anybody in Westchester ever dreamed that I was once on the stage and in Paris-
Scandalous. Do you remember the Count de Grace?
How could I ever forget him?
He used to call me his ''long-stem Blossom.''
Well, what the countess called you made international headlines.
- That was the night of the Beaux Arts Ball.
- You and I took over the show.
- Do you remember that Apache dance we did?
- Do I?
You sure it was in the '20s?
I'm positive it was in the '20s.
It was in the '20s, wasn't it?
Mrs. Potter!
Oh, Peytie. I was just welcoming Mr. Baker to Oakwood.
- Mr. Baker, Mr. Potter.
- How do you do, Mr. Potter?
I had no idea he was that welcome.
How welcome would you say
I was in round numbers?
The rest of the theatrical people are having refreshments on the terrace.
- Possibly you'd like to join them.
- You left your motor running.
He's a sweetheart. I'll bet he'd give away his last pint of blood.
In fact, I think he has.
I absolutely forbid you getting within
20 feet of that man again. You understand?
- Peytie, wouldn't you settle for 10?
- Well, 15 at the most.
Peytie, can I help it if I'm irresistible?
It's that vitamin B1. I told you you were taking too much. You're overdoing it.
- Peytie-
- I don't care to discuss the matter at all.
- All right, Cap, hook her up.
- Give me the slack.
- I love that melody.
- That's the music for Tony De Marco and Maria's dance.
Where are they?
Oh, Tony! Maria!
Don't look now, but here comes half of them.
Don't tell me they've been rationed too.
- I know, but what are you gonna do?
If you don't cut that out, the censors will. What's he saying?
He wants to know why you didn't tell him he had to dance in a rose garden.
- What's that got to do with it?
- They're Mr. Potter's roses and he's fond of them.
But he says you don't realize what your fiiendish little roses have done.
- What have they done?
- No.
- What'd he say?
- How should I know?
They had to send his partner back to New York with rose fever.
- She doesn't like roses, so Tony hates them.
- Is that so?
Where is he? There you are.
My roses aren't too fond of you.
- What have you got to say to that?
He says he's gonna sue you and your roses for ruining his partner's health.
- Sue me?
- Sí!
This is an outrage! Where's Mason?
He got me into this.
I'm gonna have you and your theatrical troupe thrown off this place forcibly.
- Mason! Mason!
- Oh, Mr. Potter! Mr. Potter!
Let him go.
Mason will cool him off.
What happens to me they wouldn't believe on the Goodwill Hour.
- Eadie, tell Tony he'll have to get another dancing partner.
- Another partner?
- Yes.
- But who?
- That's his worry.
- Okay.
I'll stay as I am.
- Tony!
Tony!
I'm sorry.
I've never seen him-
- You are beautiful!
- He speaks English.
It's wolf talk.
That's international.
Say, Vivian's all right.
She catches on pretty quick.
Well, I taught her a few steps when her father wasn't around.
I might have known. Mrs. Potter was a great dancer herself in her day.
- Really?
- She was so smooth, she could waltz around... with a glass of beer on her bustle and never disturb the foam.
- I guess Vivian takes after her.
- A block off the old chip, huh?
That was thrilling, darling.
I think you danced beautifully.
Baby, you were great.
I want you in the show.
Thank you, Mr. Baker, but I'm afraid of Dad.
He'd never approve of it.
- Why not?
- You know how he feels about shows and show people.
- My purple past, remember?
- Vivian's gonna be in this show.
Oh, Peyton will never allow it.
- Not even with some gentle persuasion?
- What do you mean?
- Let's see. I've got it. Your boudoir.
- What are you talking about?
I'm talking about the biggest scene of your career.
Come along, you old tenderized ham.
Well, at last,
I'm worth something.
- You know what to do now?
- No, my mama never told me.
- Don't you worry about me.
- Here he is.
- Come on, baby. Do your stuff.
- Come in. Oh, Peyton.
- You sent for me, dear?
- Yes, I did.
- What's Mr. Barlow doing here?
- Protect me. This man is blackmailing us.
- Blackmail?
- What's he want, money?
- Would it were money he wanted.
- What do you mean by that?
- He threatens me unless I allow my daughter- your daughter- our daughter to dance in the show with Tony De Marco.
Why, that's unthinkable!
Oh, you blackguard.
Oh, you gangster.
How could you think of such a fiiendish scheme?
Now, Mr. Potter, the only decision
I want you to make is this.
Shall I introduce Vivian as the charming child of Mr. And Mrs. Peyton Potter... or shall I simply announce, ladies and gentlemen...
- I give you the talented daughter of the notorious Blossom Murphy?
You know her name?
You told him your name?
- No, Peyton, he knew me in Paris.
- In Paris?
You scoundrel! Out of her dark past which she has lived down so beautifully... so gracefully, you come at a time like this to blackmail her.
Ugly word, ''blackmail.''
Don't say it again.
Blackmail, blackmail, blackmail!
- How much money does he want?
- I don't know.
As I said before, you cannot bribe me with gold.
It is the artistry that was Blossom Murphy... that I would restore to the world through her daughter Vivian.
Oh, Peyton, you won't make her do it!
You won't make her appear in that show!
- I would die!
- I see no other way out, darling.
Mr. Bailey has us in his power.
- Will you give your consent, Mrs. Potter?
- If Mr. Potter insists!
What else can I do?
But I'm not fiinished with you yet.
I'll see a good lawyer today to deal with you for this outrage.
- My brother in Brooklyn, he's a wiz on blackmail cases.
- Oh, is he?
- Yes.
- Really!
- Dorita, come in. I've got a surprise for you.
- What surprise?
- What was it?
- Dad's given his consent. I can appear in the show.
Marvelous!
Then everything's donkey-dory, huh?
- What you got there?
- Sergeant Mason.
- You like him?
- Sergeant Mason? He's Sergeant Crazy!
I think it's you that's crazy.
Oh, no, no, I'm not crazy.
My name is Dorita.
- This is the man I'm going to marry.
- What?
Then he's a two-time, double-cross snake in the bush.
- Dorita.
- Yes?
- Are you the woman?
- Of course I'm a woman. Do I look like a man?
You don't understand.
You see...
I think there was someone he was playing around with in town.
Look, nobody play around me, in town, in cities, nowhere.
I thought you recognized this picture.
At fiirst minute, yes.
But the second minute, no.
It was somebody else who looked just like him, like twin sisters.
Same eyes, same hair, same mouth.
- You were telling the truth?
- Scratch my heart.
Vivian, are you in?
- Oh, it's Eadie!
- What about it? Does that frighten you?
No, I'm cold as a cucumber.
- Come in, Eadie.
- I just heard the good news.
Phil's little blackmail party really paid off.
Isn't it wonderful?
I've always wanted to dance.
- Tony's very excited about you.
- Oh, I'm glad.
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing. I feel in the pinks.
Then stop looking like Lady Macbeth.
What's wrong with her?
I don't know.
Can I get you something, Dorita?
Oh, no, no, nothing.
I feel wonderful, if you don't mind.
- Why don't you sit down? You seem restless.
- Oh, no, no.
I like it here, just standing.
- Aren't you tired?
- Yes, I guess I am.
I think I go now and turn myself in and get some shut eyes.
- You know. Good night.
- Good night, Dorita.
- I'll see you in a few minutes.
- Yes, good night.
- Dorita, you're snoring again.
Dorita! Dorita, wake up!
What's the matter, buglers?
- Where did you get this picture?
- What picture?
You know what picture.
This picture of Casey.
Your birthday next week, no?
- Don't change the subject.
- I'm not changing anything.
Casey sent you the picture for your birthday. Only, he send to me.
And now you have spoiled surprise.
That's all.
No, I haven't. It's a much better surprise this way.
- You think so, huh? Yes?
- Mm-hmm.
Good. I don't get it.
Good heavens, 10:00!
I might expect this from you in person... but when your picture wanders into strange girls' rooms-
Really.
Well! What do you want?
Mr. Mason is serving everyone mint jalops, and I bring you a mint jalops too.
- It's delicious.
- You might have saved yourself the trouble.
- I am a teetotaller. I never touch alcohol.
- You don't touch. You drink it.
I'm very sorry, but I am a very busy man, and I am never disturbed at this time.
So I'm going to ask you to run away, and take those poisonous things with you.
No, I stay and be a teetotaller too.
Maybe show me how to teetotal.
Miss Dorita, I am a businessman.
I go in for no foolishness.
- I am entirely business.
- Oh, I like that.
Maybe you show me how to be all business too. Is it fun?
Well, uh, fun? Business?
Why, certainly not. It's not supposed to be fun.
- Oh, no?
- No.
Then I don't think I like it.
I like to have fun.
- You'll never make money that way.
- Oh, money, huh?
You have lots of, don't you?
Thousands and thousands of dollars, huh?
I've done rather well, yes.
Look, Dorita has only a little.
If she had only a few thousand, she would not work for a boss.
She would work for herself in her own nightclub.
Maybe you let her have a few thousands, maybe?
Well, certainly not!
I never heard of such nonsense.
I never invest in theatrical enterprises. Never.
Now, I want you to take these two slugs I think they call them... and you tell everybody you see that I'm not to be disturbed.
- What do you invest in?
- Oh, well, several things.
- I have an investment counselor, really.
- What is that?
- He's a man who handles my money for me.
- I have one of those too.
- Who is it?
- Phil Baker.
- Phil Baker, the actor?
- Yes.
- He handles your money for you?
- Only, when he handle my money,
I never see it again.
- Like these fiive horses with letters.
- Horses?
- Yeah.
- You need say no more, Miss Dorita.
I understand why you never see your money again. You're a foolish girl.
You should insist on sound investments.
Now, tell my wife-
- Maybe you could handle my money for me.
- Sorry. I have no time.
Oh, but how much time would it took? How much time?
It takes more time than I could afford to give.
Miss Dorita, I am in no mood to listen to fiinancial suggestions.
Oh, come on here.
Sit by me.
Come on here. Sit by me and tell me more about sound investments.
- Yes, yes. You have the busiest hands.
- You think so?
Sound investments?
Well, there are quite a few of them.
- Quite a few I haven't got money for.
Just tell me one.
- One?
- Yeah.
- Well, there's National Copper.
- National Copper.
- That's very safe.
That's pretty. I like it very much.
Thank you very, very nice. Yes.
Well, uh, then, of course, there's American Steel.
American Steel.
That's beautiful too. I like too.
Thank you very, very nice.
I could say Tel and Tel.
Tel and Tel.
I like that best of all!
- I hoped you would. Yes, I hoped you-
- Yes!
And did you play money on this Tel and Tel?
Very often.
Quite a lot of money, yes.
- And she come in for you?
- Yes, if that's the way you want to put it.
I want to put it that way, yes.
I want to put all my money on her.
- On Tel and Tel?
- Yes! Thank you very, very much!
Buddy, what's the matter?
I don't know.
- But it's happened.
- What happened?
- Does that mean anything to you?
- No.
- Well, it does to me.
- I don't understand.
Oh, nobody is more surprised than I am.
Mr. Potty, I'm afraid of you.
You are, really?
National Copper, eh?
- American Steel? Well-
- Don't move!
- Mrs. Potty.
Don't mention my wife.
We're going to keep this all on an even keel.
Mrs. Potty-
- Do you remember the other night when we danced together?
You do remember. Good.
You remember how I held you in my arms?
That's the way I'm gonna hold you now.
- No, no, no. Mrs. Potty!
- We'd like to be alone, please.
Darling, how marvelous! We were just discussing the invasion- the investments.
It's Tel and Tel, Miss Dorita.
You mustn't forget it.
That's one of our soundest investments.
You can't go wrong with Tel and Tel.
Can we, darling?
Tel and Tel!
Oh, Tel and Tel!
- Thank you very, very nice.
- Just a minute.
It wasn't my fault.
He swooped me off my feet.
- Oh, chop, chop, chop.
So-
Well, old swoopy, swapping swoops at your age.
What have you got to say about that?
I told you, darling, we were simply discussing investments.
I see. Is that the way it's being done nowadays?
No wonder you come home from the offiice so tired.
That's what I say, dear.
That's what I say. No wonder.
Oh. Ketchup.
No doubt.
And from a Brazilian tomato.
Darn it.
Hook me up, will you, soldier?
- Thanks.
- Excuse me.
- Hey, where are you going?
- Andy. Andy, welcome home, Son.
- Dad.
- I knew you'd do it.
Certainly looks good to see you again after all these months.
- That goes double, Dad.
- Why didn't you wire me?
I didn't expect you till evening.
I flew in.
Gee, it's great to be home.
But, Dad, what's going on around here?
The house is full of show people.
Don't worry, Son. I locked up all the silverware and put all the breakable stuff away.
I've got a big surprise for you.
- Oh, Vivian.
- Come in, Eadie.
- Does that do it, Nanette?
- I think it will.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- My, but you look pretty.
- I hope so. Andy's coming home today.
That's right. I'm looking forward to meeting your Andy.
- You'll like him.
- I'm sure I will.
- There, that does it.
- Thank you, Nanette.
- You're welcome, Miss Vivian.
- Well, what a coincidence.
- What?
- This frame. I have one exactly like-
What are you doing with this picture on your dressing table?
- That's the man I'm going to marry.
- Are you kidding?
No, of course I'm not kidding.
It's a very good picture of him.
- I agree with you.
- You do? You don't even know him.
- Not really, but I've seen him.
- You have?
Mm-hmm. Look.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
What would your sergeant think of this?
I'll bet Dorita had something to do with it.
You wait and see.
Tell me, Dad, what's the idea?
It's a little surprise party for you, Sergeant.
Being as you're opposed to bachelor dinners... we're staging a big show next door in
Potter's gardens, and you're the guest of honor.
No fooling? You're really doing all that for me? Gee, that's swell, Dad.
Brought up the whole
Club New Yorker.
Brought up the whole show.
Well, what do ya know?
Say, wait a minute.
Did you say the Club New Yorker?
- Sure.
- But that means Phil Baker and Dorita and Eadie-
- Eadie's here, isn't she?
- You mean Miss Allen?
- Yeah.
- Sure. She's one of their stars. You know her?
Know her? I'm in love with her.
I'm going to marry her, Dad.
- Now wait a minute, Son. Hold on.
- It's true.
I came up to tell you- to tell everybody.
See here, the excitement's upset you.
You don't realize what you're saying.
- You're gonna marry Vivian Potter, remember?
- Yes, yes, I remember.
- But that can wait.
- Yeah.
- Wait?
- Well, it's like this. You see-
I can't explain now, Dad. I've got to see
Eadie right away. Where is she?
- Why, she's next door with Vivian.
- With Vivian?
You mean to say that she's over there with Vivian right in the same house?
- Sure.
See here, Son.
Was this Eadie Allen the unfiinished business you had to attend to... that night at the Club New Yorker just before you sailed?
Mm-hmm.
Well, you've certainly got a nice fiinishing job on your hands.
- Yeah, I sure have.
- You're gonna need a bracer before you face those girls.
Come on.
How about a nice mint jalopy?
Oh, darn it.
She's got me saying it now.
- Dorita, what have you done with Sergeant Mason's picture?
- Sergeant who?
- Sergeant Mason- the picture that was in this frame.
And Casey's picture, it's gone too.
What have you done with it?
Dorita. Dorita, what are you up to?
Okay, I guess the jig is down.
I might as well make a clean chest of it.
Your picture and Vivian's picture is the same picture.
- What are you talking about?
- Sergeant Mason is Sergeant Crazy and vice-a-vice-a.
You and Vivian both got same sweetheart between you.
- Dorita, you know, I think you're a little-
- No, no, I'm not little.
I'll show you. Give me this picture.
You don't believe me, huh?
I'll show you. Look.
There's your Sergeant Crazy.
And I wash my face of the whole business.
Find it, Eadie?
Andy's picture.
Then she did have it.
- Are you, uh-Are you sure it's Andy?
- Huh?
- Well, I mean-
- Well, of course it's Andy.
Isn't he handsome?
I wonder what made her do a thing like that?
I don't know.
I guess it was just one of her tricks.
Oh, clowning, huh?
Yeah... clowning.
Dorita! Where's Eadie?
Oh, it's you. Shame on you, you Dr. Jekylls and Mr. Hydes.
- Then Eadie knows. And Vivian?
- I just spilled the cat out of the beans myself.
- You did. Gee, what'll I do?
- I don't care what you do.
I know what I'd do if girl take my man away from me.
- What do you mean?
- I break her into little hunks... and then I break him into little hunks.
And then I take all the little hunks and, uh-
Well, good-bye.
I must do some rehearsalings.
Vivian!
- Andy, darling!
Oh, let me look at you, you wonderful guy with decorations and everything.
Hug me again. Closer.
It's good to have you home again after all these months. I bet you didn't miss me.
Or did you?
Well, come on. Tell me.
Andy, darling, what's the mat-
Oh, Eadie, don't go.
Come here.
This is my Sergeant Mason
I've been talking so much about.
How do you do,
Sergeant... Mason?
How do you do?
- Well, aren't you going to introduce us?
- Huh?
Oh, uh, this is
Sergeant Pat Casey.
- Miss Potter and Miss Allen.
- Pleased to meet you, I'm sure.
Sergeant Casey has been helping me with my correspondence.
Receiving certain letters for me and handing them over.
- Certain letters?
- Yes, you see, well, it's-
That's right, Vivian.
You might as well know now.
This is my Sergeant Casey. We were gonna keep it a secret, weren't we, Pat?
- Were we?
- Why, Eadie, they did know each other in Australia.
- Uh-huh.
- Isn't it a small world?
- Yeah.
- Oh, Andy, listen.
I have to run now.
I'm in the show and I have a rehearsal.
So you'll excuse me, won't you?
Oh, uh, why don't you all take a walk or something.
You and Eadie can get acquainted.
Pat and I have so much to talk about.
Haven't we, Pat?
- Have we?
- Oh, that's all right.
Andy won't mind.
See you later, kids.
Eadie-
Pat, why don't you go watch the rehearsals.
Maybe some of the girls need hooking up.
Eadie, where are you going?
- What difference does it make?
- A lot.
I'm sorry, Eadie.
Desperately sorry.
- I was going to tell you, honest I was.
- Tell me what?
About this whole thing, Vivian and me.
It doesn't mean anything.
Just childhood sweethearts, that's all.
The families, you know.
- I bet if you even ask Vivian, she'd tell you-
- She has told me.
How much?
Plenty.
- Do you remember that night in the canteen?
- Uh-huh.
I told you you were sweet.
I meant it.
You were sweet.
And you still are, Andy.
But just because you guys over there go through a lot of-
Well, never mind.
But what do you suppose the girls you leave behind think of after you've gone?
- Their man.
- Yeah, I guess they do.
I don't have to guess.
I know.
- I wrote you every day, didn't I?
- Yeah.
At night I couldn't wait to get through at the club so I could get home to write.
I know you did.
- How do you know?
- I just know, that's all.
Yeah, you know.
You men know everything.
You can tear a girl's heart right out of her and cut it up into little pieces.
A girl knows that.
Every girl knows it.
And that's why I'm gonna let
Vivian go right on through... even though the stop signal's against her.
- But, darling, you-
- I'm doing it because she- she believes in you.
She loves you, Andy.
No girl with understanding would ever let another girl down.
But you can't do this, Eadie.
I- I love-
You love yourself, Andrew Mason.
Why don't you try sitting back among the crowd for a change... instead of up close at the ringside.
Oh, that's wonderful, Tony.
Do you really mean it?
- Certainly.
- Then I'll go.
- But what about your engagement to Andy?
- You leave that to me.
- Splendid.
- See you after the show.
- Okay.
- Oh, Eadie, isn't it wonderful?
I'm on my way to Broadway.
I'm going to New York with Tony De Marco.
- I'm his new dancing partner!
- What?
I don't know what the folks will say, about Andy, I mean.
Of course, it's only a family affair.
We never really loved each other.
- You mean that-
- Well, even Andy knows that.
Anyway, the folks started it.
Let them work it out.
- Eadie, come on. They're waiting.
- There's something I have to do.
I know- the fiinale. You can't keep those children waiting all night.
But you don't understand. It's your son.
I have to tell him something he doesn't know.
Then he's the only one who doesn't.
But just in case, I'll tell him.
You will?

Thank you. Professor, please.
I think this is the sweetest piece of two-timing I ever saw.
You want to end up playing in honky-tonks all your life?
Trudy, get into position, will ya?
Hey, Dan. Give me a hand with the scenery. Come on.

Come on! Come on!
Get back to your jobs!
What do you think I'm paying you for, to work here or enjoy yourself? Get at that bar!
You three come with me.
Trudy, honey, you were wonderful.
Listen to 'em yell.
- Come on! Let's go out for another bow.
- Wait a minute, you pinheads.
- What do you think you're doing?
- We're just trying something different, Mr. Sharkey.
Oh, you were? Well, you pulled a hundred people away from my bar.
- It's empty out there.
- Well, it just shows ya.
You bet it does! If it happens six times a night,
I'm out of business. Get out. You're fired!
- Now wait-
- Come on, Johnny. Don't argue.
All right. If that's all the appreciation you've got of what your customers want...
- it's jake with me.
- Get out, or I'll have you thrown out!
- We've been thrown out of and back into better joints!
- Go on, throw 'em out!
Sharkey did us a favor.
We're through working in honky-tonks.
Something'll turn up.
- And stay out!
- Johnny!
Johnny, I was looking for you while you was acting over at Sharkey's, but I couldn't wait.
- My boy, you was great!
- You all know Sam Weaver.
Know him? I've been bitten by him. How are ya? Scat!
Johnny, I got news for ya.
Great news, Johnny!
- Did you hit it?
- There's millions there.
Why, there's so much gold you can shovel it up like coal in a bin.
I knew something would turn up.
Did you hear that? Sam hit it.
And you were worrying about us getting kicked out of Sharkey's. Why don't you grow up?
Well, Johnny, I was just trying to tell you about a new lead I got up in Sonora.
But this time I can't miss!
All I need is another little grubstake.
- Oh.
- Well, Johnny, it's an investment.
Safe as Ralston's bank.
- But it's after banking hours.
- Uh, thank you, Johnny. You'll never be sorry.
Why, one of these days we'll be riding down Market Street in our own carriages... with harness buckles made of solid gold!
So long, Johnny. God bless you, my boy.
God bless you.
Bighearted John. We ain't got a job... don't know where the next one's coming from.
I know where my next one's coming from.
I'm going right back to my own little single.
Oh, don't talk like that, Beulah.
We have to stick together.
Johnny'll get us another booking.
Sure, he'll get us another booking.
And then what happens?
He's gotta try out a new act, and boom, we're out in the alley again.
Well, that's the only way we'll ever get anywhere.
Mr. Cornell, I wish to wish you all the luck in the world.
But you can include me out.
I am through.
Listen. That goes for me too.
When I'm walking around, I want my stomach smiling. I want soles on my shoes.
- Break up the act- is that what you want?
- No, they don't.
Never mind, Trudy.
If they want to quit, let 'em.
- I never begged anybody to stick with me if they didn't want to.
- They didn't mean it.
Gee, you were happy to be with him when everything was going all right.
- But as soon as we hit thebumps,
you talk about walking out. 
# Some other to win #
# Fight manfully onward ##
Why, Johnny's smarter
than Sharkey or any of'em. 
And someday he'll be right up on top,
and he'll take us along with him. 
This is no time to throw cold water on him.
He needs us as much as we need him.
What we ought to do now is give him a pat on the back.
That's all you've been doing is giving him a pat on the back.
- What do you get from him? The cold shoulder.
- No, it isn't.
I understand Johnny. He's trying to get ahead. He has his mind on other things.
That's right. It sure isn't on you.
If he didn't need you for his act... you may as well be painted on the backdrop.
Honey, she's absolutely right.
You don't need the guy.
You can get your old job back at the Tivoli in a minute.
Well, I don't want it. I'd rather stick with him. And you two are all wrong.
It isn't me. It's Johnny's showmanship that puts us over.
And if I'm willing and satisfied to believe in him, why can't you?
Oh, gee. Okay, honey. If that's the way you feel about it, we'll stick.
But remember, I'm doing it just for you.
And that goes for her too.
- Not a very big night tonight, is it, pop?
- Heaven will provide.
You think heaven would mind if I helped out a little bit?
We need everyone's help, brother.
Have you got a city license to use the streets and take up collections?
Oh, sure.
They'd have run me out of town long before now if it hadn't been for that.
Heaven's gonna provide for both of us, pop.

Would you bring righteous wrath down on your head?
Brother, remember, you're doing it in the sight of heaven.
I ask your pardon, sir. I didn't have a right understanding of what was going on.
- What do you mean, Sharkey, by bothering these good people? - Well, I-
Have you no respect for religion?
Get back to your gin mill.
Get along.
I got everyone but you and Sharkey.
You better kick in.
Okay. 500, if you'll stay away from my place.
- You got a deal.
- This ain't decent, it ain't. It ain't decent.

You're the last holdout on Pacific Street.
We all had to kick through.
- Give him his 500 bucks, Lou.
- Hey, Sharkey.
I'm gonna make you a very special offer.
To the other boys it was 500, but to you it's a thousand.
- Get out of here. Get out of here!
- Take it easy.
Okay. It's jake with me.
I'll see you in the poorhouse.
Wait a minute, Johnny.
He'll kick in. Listen.
He's got you licked sure as my name's Foghorn Ryan.
Hey, Lou.
Get the thousand.
"John Cornell, proprietor. " Now, that doesn't sound like the Barbary Coast.
Aren't they usually Mulligans or Hooligans or Sweeneys that run these places?
That's his name, and he's a remarkable fellow in a way.
- In a way?
- Pulled himself up by his own banjo strings.
That's right. Started out playing his banjo... doing a song and dance on an Oakland ferry...
- for whatever the passengers tossed in his cap.
- Really?
Well, quite a place.
Three cheers for Mr. Cornell. From ragtime to riches by way of the Oakland ferry.
Just a starter.
His real ambition is to climb Nob Hill.
Oh, don't tell me. From the Barbary Coast to Nob Hill isn't a climb. It's a career.
Not forJohnny Cornell.
It wouldn't even faze him.
He has plenty of ambition and brains to back him up.
And if nerve helps, he'll get there with bells on.
Oh, Ned, come on.
That's too much.
Good evening.

Doing the Grizzly Bear #
# The Grizzly Bear
The Grizzly Bear, The Grizzly Bear #
# I said the Grizzly Bear ##
- Honey, you were wonderful.
- Oh, thanks.
- Listen to 'em out there.
- Looks like we did it. 
- You were all great.
- Oh, the place is packed.
They're standing three deep in the bar.
If this is capacity tonight, can you imagine what's gonna happen when we really get started?
We're playing to the best people in town. You see who was out there? A bunch from Nob Hill.
You oughta be more careful who you let in the place.
That's all right.
That's the crowd I'm after, the carriage trade.
They're the kind of people
I want to patronize us.
That's about all it amounts to, Johnny.
They're patronizing us.
Brother, your social register's the Police Gazette. 
They won't give you a tumble.
No?
Well, Bernice, don't you think we've had about enough slumming?
There won't be another show for an hour.
You've seen everything.
- I've seen everything except, uh-
- Except what?
What I really came to see- the remarkableJohn Cornell.
Uh-oh. Get the check.
She's off again.
- What's this?
- White Seal.
'87. Compliments of Mr. Cornell.
Well! Now I know
I'll have to meet him.
Waiter, would you ask Mr. Cornell to come to our table, please?
Yeah, sure. Uh, yes, ma'am.
Here, bub.
You pour it.
"Here, bub. You pour it. "
That'll give you an example of what to expect from the proprietor.
He'll probably draw up a chair and offer you a cigar.
Good evening. I'm John Cornell.
Is everything all right?
Oh, uh, please let me thank you for the wine, Mr. Cornell.
My pleasure, Miss Croft.
Oh? Am I discovered?
Why, everyone knows
Miss Bernice Croft... especially if they've seen her drive her carriage through Golden Gate Park.
Thank you.
Won't you join us?
I'd- I'd like you to meet Ned Clark,
Phil MacRae and Dick Greenwood.
Uh, don't get up, gentlemen.
I only have a moment.
I have to see that things are kept going.
I think your entertainment's marvelous.
I'll probably spend the next week... snapping whalebone in my corsets trying to do the Grizzly Bear.
Well, I'm sure if you watched the entertainers you'd pick it up in no time.
Oh, but you don't know how frightfully dense I can be.
Oh, and persistent.
Yes, I am, when I want to learn something.
- Well, I could have Miss Beulah Clancy-
- Oh, dear, no.
Dancing with another girl would remind me of boarding school.
I prefer the headmaster.
Well, I could-
I'm giving a party at my home next Sunday night.
Won't you come and bring your friends?
Well, thanks. I'd like to.
Now, if you'll excuse me, please.
Bernice, I washed my hands of you entirely.
- What are we waiting for? Let's dance.
- Well, hello. 
- I'm so glad you came, Mr. Cornell.
- Good evening, Miss Croft.
- I want you to meet Miss Evans-
- How do you do?
- Miss Clancy-
- How do you do?
- Mr. Daley.
- How do you do? Miss Croft, this is a highlight in my career.
And when you really want to get this party rolling, just give us the high sign.
Would you let me present you to some of my friends first?
My Aunt Harriet and Colonel Weatherby.
Miss Evans and Mr. Cornell.
- How do you do?
- Miss Clancy and Mr. Daley.
Why, Colonel, what beautiful medals.
- Thank you. Civil War, my dear.
- Oh, that's a long story.
Well, I'd love to hear all about it.
Well, I'd be very glad to tell you... but I'm afraid that Harriet has heard it so often that, uh-
Well, that's exactly what I figured.
You will excuse us, won't you?
Come along, Colonel.
Some of the more conservative ones leave early. Then we'll have some fun.
- My encore, Bernice.
- Oh, Ned.
Ned, I'll give you the best of a bargain.
You recall Miss Evans?
- How do you do?
- Hello.
- And Mr. Cornell?
- Hello.
- Nice to see you.
- Ned's a marvelous dancer. You don't know what I'm giving up.
I think I do. But I'll try to be as unselfish as you are.
I did a bit of pirating, didn't I?
Now don't tell me getting you in here all to myself has been wasted.
Oh, I appreciate it.
I'd like to see everything in your house.
This is the kind of room
I'd like to have myself someday.
It was my father's study.
He was something of an art patron.
Yes, I know.
Edouard de Reske, Nellie Melba,
Adelina Patti.
All autographed to your father.
You know, he must have been a big man... building that opera house, bringing all those great artists to San Francisco.
Oh, exhibitionism, I expect, to prove how little he thought of money.
I see. And is that why you carry on?
No. It eases my social conscience... makes up for the shocking things I do.
I still think it's pretty fine. I don't know of a better way you could spend your money.
Well, I'm- I'm glad that you approve of something about me.
Aida.  Original manuscript.
"Produced at the San Francisco
Opera House, 1882."
You never gamble, do you?
- Not with women.
- Not very flattering.
Why?
I'll tell you why.
It's only a 50-cent hack ride from here to the Barbary Coast... but it takes a million dollars to come back up... if you want to stay.
Well, it would be nice having you for a neighbor.
Oh. Just a minute.
You wanted me to kiss you, didn't you?
Mr. Cornell, you're priceless.
- For worlds, I wouldn't have missed knowing you.
- 

Hey, Johnny. Oh, excuse me. 
The folks are waiting for Trudy to sing, and you'll have to do her music.
- That is, if you can spare him.
- To Miss Evans? Why, of course.
For a song.
Thank you- too much.
Perhaps that was a fortunate interruption.
We might have become much too well acquainted.
Maybe we will- the next time we see each other.
You all set?
I'll give Trudy an introduction.
Never mind. We're leaving.
Come on, honey.
- Hello.
- Be right with you.
- They just brought in the take, and I'm checking it over.
I don't know how you keep your mind on it.
Every time I come into this room, since you've had it fixed over... well, I kind of feel that the butler should bring in my card.
- Yeah.
- And if I didn't know that we was on Pacific Street...
I would swear that we was up on Nob Hill.
Why don't you pipe down and let me work?
What's this? "Dance Land: $1,846.35."
Whoo! That ain't bad.
- It'll do.
- That'll do?
Brother, you sure got chummy with money in a hurry, didn't ya?
I can remember the time when you retired on that kind of dough.
Yeah. So can I.
"Silver Palm Ballroom: $2,100.50."
Johnny! How are you, my boy?
Uh-oh! Here he comes!
Lock up the dough, quick.
Johnny!
You struck it rich.
- Hey, you. Come on. Get out of here, or I'll call a cop.
- How are you, Sam?
Oh, that's what I came to tell you, Johnny.
This time I got it. Gold!
We'll be rolling in it!
Why, it'll be raining down like a cloudburst.
- I got my hands right on it.
- No, you ain't.
Johnny, I found a new bonanza- an El Dorado, a Comstock- and no one knows about it but me.
- All I need-
- Is another little grubstake.
Well, Johnny, I was gonna work up to that gradual.
Just take your time.
The answer's no anyway.
What happened to the last one?
Johnny, I swear I never could figure that out.
It just wasn't there.
Oh, this one's different.
Why, I wouldn't even need a pick.
There's nuggets laying there like rocks on a creek bottom just waiting to be shoveled up.
- Give him $200, Dan.
- Yeah, come on. Get out of-What?
You heard me. Give him $200.
He's got a new mine.
You're telling me. And he don't need no pick for this one either.
Oh, Johnny, you'll never regret it, boy!
Why, one of these days we'll be pitching gold watches down Market Street... just to see how far we can throw 'em.
- Why, we'll be riding in carriages.
- Oh, sure.
On your way out, have a drink- the bottle with the skull and crossbones on it.
So long, Johnny. I'll be seeing ya.
God bless ya, my boy.
God bless ya!
That guy keeps bucking in to you, you'll be the best-dressed man on the breadline.
- Never can tell. He might hit it sometime.
- Ah, what are you talking about?
Green Mill Rollerdrome, only $428?
That won't even pay for the band and the waiters.
- It needs publicity. It hasn't caught on yet.
- And it never will.
People ain't gonna spend their money putting wheels on their shoes... and splitting their pants bouncing off the floor.
It's gonna be the biggest attraction in town, and you're gonna see it go over tonight.
- I know just what it takes. - Mm-hmm. So do
I. Andrew Carnegie and Hetty Green's bankroll.
Get out of that thing and put on some street clothes.
- Where we going?
- To the Rollerdrome.
Oh, them roller skaters make me dizzy.
Come in. 
- It's me, honey.
- I'll be right there. 
Ooh, don't whistle in the dressing room,
Johnny. It's bad luck. 
You should know that. 
You going someplace after the show?
No. It was so warm, I decided to freshen up and change my makeup.
Well, never mind the makeup.
We're going out.
Going out? Why?
Well, do you have to ask why when a fella tells you he's taking you out?
Well, when you ask me I do.
I'll have to ask you out more often then- so you'll get used to it.
But what about the midnight show?
Ah, skip it. The place isn't big enough to hold the crowd anyway... so if they don't like it, they can leave.
What's the matter?
Don't you feel like going out?
I never felt more like doing anything in my life.
A night off and no work.
Oh, Johnny, I can't believe it.
It sounds wonderful.
All right. Then get all dolled up and make it extra beautiful.
- Where you been?
- We were delayed.
Oh.
What do you think of that? They know us.
I should say so. As soon as it was known that Miss Evans-
- Paul, get us a bottle of wine, will ya?
- Yes, sir.
Wine, Johnny? What for? Whose birthday is it?
Will you stop asking why and what for?
It's our night out.
- Then what am I doing here?
- You're the master of ceremonies.
Go up in the bandstand.
The leader will tell you what to do.
Oh, now I know what I'm doing here.
Oh, I think this place is doing fine.
It's almost packed.
It's building up. A few more guest nights and it'll catch on.
What you need is some special attraction to get the customers started coming in.
Funny, isn't it, how different it looks from where you sit.
- How?
- Oh, it's such a relief to be just a customer once in a while.
You'll never know how much
I appreciate it.
Well, we're gonna have lots of nights out together from now on.
Thank you, thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
And now, before I introduce our guest star of the evening...
I give you Johnny Cornell's famous troupe of skating stars... that hit show, anyplace they land... those babes and boys on rollers, the Continental Cadets!
Thank you.
# It's tulip time in Holland #

Thank you, thank you, thank you.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, the big moment of the evening's entertainment.
The pièce de résistance- which means she's swell- the one you've all been waiting for... that lovely little lady, our guest, with the golden pipes of Pan...
San Francisco's own,
Miss Trudy Evans!
- Go on, honey. They're waitin' for ya.
- "Our night out. "
"Pick on Me. "
It's all fixed.
#When I was born my pa and ma #
#They looked at me and said #
# Oh, pshaw #
#The doctor said
It's a girl, I think #
#And Pa went out and got a drink #
#Then Ma said I looked just like Pa #
#And Pa said I took after Ma #
#AuntJane said
I looked like a quince #
#And I've been a stepchild ever since #
# Oh #
#They always, always #
# Pick on me #
#They never, never let me be #
# I'm so very lonesome
Awfully sad #
# It's a long time since I've been glad #
# But I know what I'll do by and by #
# I'll eat some worms #
#And then I'll die #
#And when I'm gone you wait and see #
#They'll all be sorry that they picked on me #
# Now, why do they always, always have to pick on me #
#Why do they never, never never let me be #
# I'm so very lonesome #
#Awfully sad #
# It's a long, long time #
# Since I've been glad #
# But I know what I'll do
Mmm #
# By and by #
# I'm gonna eat me some worms #
#And then I'll die #
#And when I'm gone #
#Just you wait and see #
#They'll all be sorry #
#Terribly, terribly sorry #
# Gee, they're really gonna be sorry that they picked #
# On #
# Me #
It's too bad I haven't got someone like you to entertain at all my places.
Then they'd all go over like the Rollerdrome did tonight.
You didn't mind going on, did you, honey?
No, but you could have told me.
I'd have been glad to do it anyway.
I'm glad to be a part of anything you do.
You are. That's half the fun of doing things- having you in on it.
- Is it?
- Sure.
It's wonderful the way you've made it all come true.
- Proud of me?
- Mm-hmm.
You've got about everything you started out for... except the house on Nob Hill.
Oh, I've forgotten all about that.
I know where I belong- doing what I'm doing.
They haven't got anything up there I want.
Too bad about Bernice Croft, isn't it?
- What about her?
- Ned Clark told me her gold mine was playing out.
She began speculating pretty heavily, and he tried to stop her, but-
Anyway, she's lost everything.
They're even going to auction off her things.
Well, I guess she had fun with it while she had it.
I wonder what a girl like her will do now.
She can't support herself.
That's the trouble with inheriting those big family bankrolls.
You're better off where you are, in show business.
Show business.
That's all that makes your life worthwhile, isn't it, Johnny?
I'm satisfied. You can't always have everything.
No.
I guess you're right.
 Lady bid $200. Ladies and gentlemen,
who'll make it 25? Who'll give me the 25?
- Twenty-five. 
- 225.
- 230.
- $230. Bid 30, gentlemen. $230. Make it 35.
- Thirty-five. 
- 235 and going at 40, 40, 40, 40.
- 240.
- $240. Who'll say 250?
- 250.
- $250. $250, ladies and gentlemen... for this beautiful, original
Sébastian Érard concert harp.
- Who'll say 300?
Come, come, come, ladies and gentlemen.
This bidding is ridiculous.
There isn't another Sébastian Érard instrument to be had this side of New York or Europe.
- Who'll make it-
- 350.
- Are you loco?
What do you want that harp for?
Why, you'll break off all your fingernails.
So, I want it. There's a lot of other things around here I want too.
$350.
Is that all I'm bid for
a beautiful instrument like this?
All right. 
350 once, 350 twice. 
Sold to Mr. John Cornell. 
You're hooked. When you die, where you're going, you won't need that thing.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, an exclusive
item from the Croft musical offering. 
A collection of opera scores as produced at the Croft Opera House... and I'm sure they require no further recommendations.
- Now what am I offered?
Thank you, Mr. Cornell. 
$3,000.
Who'll make it 3,500?
3,500. 3,500.
- 3,500?
- Just a moment.
There must be some mistake.
The opera scores are not for sale.
But, Miss Croft, they're offered in the inventory.
I said they were not for sale.
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Cornell. I shall have to ask you to withdraw your bid.
Boy, are you lucky.
Stay here and bid on the paintings and bric-a-brac for me.
Bric-a-what?
Well, that's a little more like it... coming from a guy whose old man used to be a hod carrier.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, what am I
offered for this fine Theobald Boehm instrument?
- Fifty bucks.
- Fifty dollars... from the stout gentleman with the diamond stickpin for this fine Bavarian flute.
Flute? Me?
I'm bidding on a flute?
- Why did you do that?
- The scores are not for sale.
Meaning they're not for sale to me... because I'm from the other side of the tracks and wouldn't appreciate them.
No. On the contrary,
I think you're one of the very few people... who would appreciate them and understand what they meant to my father.
Then why did you stop my bid?
Because some things are beyond mere monetary value.
But I'll make you a present of them.
They'll be delivered with the other things you've purchased.
But you can't afford to do that.
I'll give you 5,000 for 'em- 10,000.
You said once it was only a 50-cent hack fare up here from the Barbary Coast... but it took a million dollars to stay.
Well, you've just about made your million.
- I haven't made that much.
- You will someday.
But there's one thing you must learn... and that's to accept a gift with merely a simple "thank you. "
The scores are yours.
- Thank you.
- You're quite welcome.
And now, perhaps that I'll no longer be able to be patron to the San Francisco Opera... they may find a new impresario in Mr. John Cornell.
I'm afraid that would be a little bit over my head.
Oh, I'm sure nothing would be over your head that you set your mind to.
You have a way of saying things that-
That what?
I'll have to say this my way.
Suppose I set my mind on you.
I'd be flattered, but for the present I have other plans.
I'm taking whatever I have left... and shaking the dust of San Francisco from my worn-out sandals.
You see, John?
In some ways we're very much alike.
We both have an inordinate amount of pride, and I-
Well, I just couldn't remain here and have my friends feeling sorry for me.
Those are the kind of friends you'd be better off without.
I'm not that kind.
Well, I'm glad of that.
I might be glad to take advantage of it sometime.
But if I do come back to San Francisco, it'll be to everything I've always had.
So once again, John... for worlds, I wouldn't have missed knowing you.
Good-bye.
Don't say that.
Then au revoir.
That's better.
That harp is driving me bugs!
I thought she was out shoppin'.
What did Johnny want with that disappointed zither?
He was gonna build a number around it, but he hasn't gotten to it yet.
A number, eh?
And I know the number.
It's that enamel-puss society wench up on Nob Hill.
And if I didn't hit it right in the nose... why did he buy up nearly everything she auctioned off?
And now he's trying to buy the house too.
- Well, that's Johnny's affair.
- You said it.
Aw, honey, you ain't kiddin' nobody.
You're dead gone on Johnny, but you don't do nothin' about it.
Well, I can't very well throw myself at him.
Well, you could throw something at him.
I know if he was my man and I wanted him,
I'd go after him hallelujah and high water.
- Trudy, better get dressed. You got five minutes.
- Mm-hmm.
Well, I'm your man, babe.
You want me, don't ya?
Ha! I know you love me.
#Why, Bedelia, what do you mean by putting in this false alarm #
# False alarms, me foot
That scallywag tried to take me in his arms #
#Well, why not #
# Bedelia, I want to steal ya #

K- E-L-L-Y!
What a guy!
- Great show, Mr. Cornell.
- Thank you.
There's a gentleman waiting in your office, Mr. Cornell.
Thanks. Take a bottle of White Seal to
Mr. Dawson's table with my compliments.
- Who, sir?
- Douglas Dawson, the biggest producer in London.
- Table number 9.
- Yes, sir.
After the way I've been raving about Miss Evans,
I hope you're not too disappointed.
Not at all. You're quite right.
She's wasted here.
I'd like to drop backstage and have a chat with her.
Fine.
I think she'd be delighted.
- Evening, Burkham.
- How do you do, Mr. Cornell?
I received your message, and while
I don't generally transact business...
- after office hours-
- I was wondering why I hadn't heard from you.
I haven't been able to contact the lady since
I last saw you. I presume she's traveling.
Yeah, she was in Newport last week as a guest on Count somebody-or-other's yacht.
Yes. That's where I addressed your last offer.
The letter was returned.
I must say, Mr. Cornell, she doesn't seem to be much interested... in your desire to purchase her home... even though you keep increasing the amount you're willing to offer.
If you find out where she is, raise it again.
The newspapers say she's going to Europe.
- On that yacht?
- I really couldn't say.
- Say, Johnny, I just- Oh.
- It's all right, Dan. Come on in.
This is Mr. Burkham of
Burkham & Burkham Real Estate Brokers.
- Mr. Daley.
- How do you do, Mr. Daley?
Hello. Buying another honky-tonk, huh?
Say, what you peddling, bub?
Mr. Daley, Burkham & Burkham do not peddle honky-tonks.
Burkham & Burkham deal in high-class properties exclusively.
- He'd make a good straight man.
- Good night, Mr. Cornell.
If I have any further word from Miss Croft,
I shall contact you immediately.
Good night.
Listen, Johnny.
It ain't none of my business, but-
- Then don't say it.
- I won't.
But for a smart guy, you're making a champion chump of the world out of yourself.
You don't want to buy that house.
You're just trying to make a hit with her.
- I thought we agreed it's none of your business.
- I won't say a word.
But just listen to this, mister.
Nob Hill and the Barbary Coast don't mix no more than champagne and beer.
If it'll shut you up, she's on her way to Europe.
Some count's taking her.
Oh! Well, then let me be the first to congratulate you.
- Say, Dan, go down and check the bar, will you?
- I certainly will.
And I'll pour myself a big one just to celebrate your great victory.
Very well, Miss Evans.
We'll leave it that way.
When you make your decision,
I'll expect a cable from you.
Thanks.
And I really appreciate it.
And thank you, Ned.
You're still my most loyal audience.
- And always will be, Trudy. Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Say, it was nice of Dawson to come backstage to meet you.
- He like the show?
- He must have thought it was pretty good.
He made me an offer to go to London.
You're not thinking of taking it?
Yes, I am.
Trudy, you can't.
I can't let you go.
Why, losing you would be like losing part of myself.
I used to feel like that too, Johnny.
But, well, you have other plans, and...
I have to think of getting ahead, the same as you have.
But what's Dawson got to offer you that I can't give you?
London? You're a star over here.
You don't know how you'd go over there.
- Don't you think I could make good?
- Of course you would.
But I don't want you to make good for anybody else.
If you want to do a musical, I'll get a theater uptown. I'll buy the Majestic.
I'll get you the West Coast rights to any show you want... and I'll put you over bigger and better than Dawson ever could.
I always told you when I went up
I wanted you there with me.
I know, Johnny, but I wouldn't fit in up where you're going.
Oh, so Dan's been giving you that.
Well, for your information,
I'm not going up there.
Beside, Trudy, there's no place
I'd ever go that you wouldn't fit in.
Do you really mean that?
Have I ever lied to you?
Oh, I should have thrown that Dawson out... instead of blowing him to a bottle of wine.
Johnny, I didn't accept
Mr. Dawson's offer.
Well, what did you want to scare me like that for?
You almost had me believing it.
Take off your makeup, and don't give me that stuff about the midnight show.
- We're going out.
- Oh, the last time you asked me out-
Yeah, yeah. I know.
But this time, no entertainment.
Just dinner for two at the Palace.
Yeah?
Telegram, Mr. Cornell. 
Get dressed, honey.
Thank you, Sam.
- Well, hello.
- Hello.
It was nice of you to respond so quickly when I sent for you.
I knew you were the one friend
I could depend on.
At least you were the only one who seemed to care what had become of me.
I thought you were on your way to Europe on Count "Somebody's" yacht.
Oh, Count Faroni lost all interest in Bernice Croft when he found out... she wouldn't be able to support him in the manner to which he was accustomed.
He replaced me with a steel heiress from Pittsburgh.
- Well-
- Well, does that bring us back to business?
If you've decided to sell.
John, you're as easy to read as an open book.
The reason you've made me so many generous offers on my house... was your way of showing that you wanted to help me.
- Well- - You knew the money I got from the auction wouldn't last long.
Well, it hasn't.
I'm flat.
If you sell the house, it'll give you a new stack of chips.
That won't last long either.
And then what?
You see, like Count Faroni...
I have to be supported in a manner to which I'm accustomed.
But I thought that-
I know. I said you were an open book.
You'd not only offer to buy my house... but you'd offer me yourself and everything you had with it.
Well, I appreciate it, and I'd be an asset to anyone with a house on Nob Hill.
I didn't mean that.
I don't need anyone to make them accept me.
It's like you to say that.
I once told you we were both proud.
I wouldn't sell on those terms, and you wouldn't buy under those conditions.
Well-
Heavens, Johnny. If this is a proposal, don't stand there saying "well. "
Use a little imagination.
- Hello, Dan.
- Fine time to be showing up.
It's almost 1:00.
You know that?
There's been three wine agents here... and that real estate guy was here asking about buying the Majestic.
All right. I'll close the deal in the morning.
Listen, Johnny. It's none of my business, but a theater's a gamble.
You've been doing all right with the music halls and a Rollerdrome.
Didn't I promise you that I'd put you all up on top sometime?
Yeah. It was nice talk, too, when we didn't have a dime.
I know you're doing this mostly for Trudy, but, Johnny... if she knew what she was getting in for, she wouldn't want no part of it.
She'd be satisfied to stay right here.
Well, I wouldn't be. I'm through with honky-tonks and Barbary Coast.
- I'm gonna be respectable.
- What for?
Because my fiancée would like it that way.
Ah, your- Oh, my hearing.
You know, for a minute I thought you says your fiancée. Now, look, Johnny-
- I did. 
- You what?
I said "my fiancée. "
For your information, Mr. Daley, champagne and beer and Barbary Coast and Nob Hill do mix.
I'm marrying Bernice Croft.
- Well-
- Well what?
Well, it's too late now.
I always knew you was a sucker for gold mines, but this time, brother... you're gonna need one!
- What's the matter?
- Oh, nothin'.
Did Johnny close the deal for the Majestic Theater?
Mm-hmm.
Tomorrow morning.
By the way, he don't want to be connected with honky-tonks anymore.
- He's gonna be respectable.
- Is it as bad as all that?
It's worse. You know why he's doing it too, don't you?
- I know why he's buying the Majestic.
- That's what you think.
That's what I thought too. I thought it was gonna be for you, Beulah and myself.
But that ain't the half of it.
Well, I guess he's doing it for himself too.
After all, Johnny's outgrown Pacific Street.
He's an important person now.
Oh, no.
I've heard everything.
I thought that Croft dame was the only one filling him with that stuff, but if you're-
- Miss Croft hasn't anything to do with it.
- No, no, no, no.
She's just gonna sit out front and tell him how you and me should be doing our stuff.
Maybe you can like it, but not me.
I can take orders from the headman, but when the headman's wife starts running the show-
- Wife?
- Wife. That's what I said. Wife.
From now on he's gonna be known as Miss Croft's husband.
She's got the Indian sign
on him already. 
She's the one that made him
quit the coast for that society stuff. 
If that's the way he wants it, it's his wedding... and that's gonna be his funeral too.
Overture!
Beulah!
Hey, Beulah!
- Where have you been? Where's Trudy? You hear that overture?
- She's gone.
Look at yourself. You look like the last half of Finnegans Wake. 
- Get in there and put some powder on your face.
- She's gone to London!
Oh, she's gone to London. That's very funny.
The overture's on, she's-
- She's what?
- Trudy's gone to London!
- Gone to London?
- Yeah!
What are you talkin' about? This time of night you couldn't get a ferry boat to Oakland.
Gone to London?

Bravo!
Oh, Ellie! More flowers than I've ever seen before.
- And they brought me out for a dozen curtain calls.
- Heavens, miss!
And why shouldn't they?
Here, let me take these. I'll put them in water.
All right.
I can't believe it's true.
I've had opening nights before- lots of'em.
There was always someone there to sort of help you over the bumps... someone you knew would back you up.
It's funny, isn't it?
How scared you can be when you think you're all alone in a strange country... without-
Johnny!
Oh, Johnny.
I oughta punch you right in the nose for running out on me... but I feel just as proud of you as if I did it myself.
- You had that audience right in your pocket.
- Were you out front?
Sure. I cabled for tickets from Paris.
You didn't think I'd be within a thousand miles of you on your opening night and not be here.
I thought you were a thousand miles away.
I read you were in Italy.
Sure, I saw the works, from soup to Switzerland.
And what those babies don't know about show business over there would fill Carnegie Hall.
Show business.
That's still your first love, isn't it?
- Oh, I didn't mean that, Johnny.
- I know.
Bernice is in Paris- dressmakers and all that stuff.
She's sailing tomorrow, and I'm boarding the boat at Southampton.
- It's about time I was getting home.
- Yes, of course.
I guess you're itching to get back.
- And how are Dan and Beulah and the Grizzly?
- Fine. Dan's running the place.
I don't expect
I'll be seeing much of it from now on.
- Did you buy the Majestic?
- No.
It wouldn't have been any fun without you there.
I'm going high-hat in a big way.
- I'm taking over the opera house.
- Oh, that's wonderful.
Sure. I went into opera stuff while I was in Italy- and take La Scala, for instance.
It's only a high-class concert hall.
The only difference is you play to the carriage trade... and the people in the audience don't know what the performers are yelling about.
But I think I can show 'em back home how it should be done.
If you say you can, Johnny,
I know you will.
Gee, Trudy, it's like old times... having you give me a pat on the back and telling me to go after things.
That's someone else's privilege now.
Oh, she's all for it.
Keep opera in the Croft family and all that stuff.
Funny, isn't it?
Wonder where we'd all be now if we'd been satisfied just plugging along... on that old act we tried out at Sharkey's that night.
I wonder.
Well, we can all take a bow.
We were tops, and we proved it.
We've got everything we started out for.
I guess you've got everything you started out for.

We're from the newspapers.
- Can we see Miss Evans?
- London Times. 
- Just a moment, gentlemen.
- Thank you, miss.
Well, I, uh- I'd better go now.
Keep in touch with me, Trudy. I might want you for a big show myself sometime.
You bet I will, Johnny.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
- Will you grant us an interview?
- That was an extraordinary performance.
Was that your husband?
Tosca, 1,750.
Il Trovatore, 1,600.
Aida, less than 1,500.
Why, there were more people on the stage than there were in the audience.
This free list looks like the entire social register.
Is there a law against people paying money to hear opera?
Mrs. Cornell's friends. But when you sponsor opera, you don't expect to make money.
Who doesn't? A sponsor is an angel, an angel is a sucker, and a sucker's a sap.
If business doesn't pick up at the end of the week, put out the closing sign.
- But, Mr. Cornell-
- And cut out the free list!
I've been trying to tell you for over a month that the place was on the skids... but no, you were too busy up there with that spaghetti carnival at the opera house.
- I'm trying to get that out of the red too.
- It don't pay off, brother.
You understand?
What do you do?
You go and sell the Rollerdrome, then you sell
Dance Land, and now the Silver Palms, and why?
To supply them imported canaries with birdseed.
If you don't mind a suggestion, you'd better do something about pulling the Grizzly Bear out.
The sheriff's gonna be breathing right down the back of your neck.
She ain't kidding either, brother.
We ain't even got half a stock down in that bar.
Our old customers have to go someplace else because we can't supply their favorite brands.
Sure, all the good chorus girls have quit for live jobs.
Why, the ones we got left look like something that came across with the covered wagons- pullin' 'em.
Listen, you still got a chance to get out... if you'd bring Trudy back.
That's a swell suggestion.
I take Trudy out of a hit show in London to bring her back to work on the Barbary Coast.
She wouldn't think about that. She'd be on the next boat if you'd send her an S.O.S.
Forget it. I got myself on the skids,
I'll get myself off of it.
I'll get another singer.
I made a star attraction out ofTrudy.
I can do the same with another girl.
All right, if you don't know who your real friends are.
But you're playing a chump, and you have been since the night you fell for that society stuff.
I'll say you have. As long as you stuck to
Pacific Street, nobody could outsmart you.
And you'd still be smart if you'd-
If I'd what?
I'll tell ya.
If you'd shake that dame there before she breaks you, and come back to the Grizzly Bear.
- Who are you talking about?
- I told you it wouldn't do any good, Dan.
When a guy's being made a monkey of and likes it... he don't want to hear the truth. Come on.
Maybe you're right. And since we're being so frank, I've got something to tell you.
There you are. I knew you'd see we were just thinking about you.
- What is it?
- You're fired, both of you!
And I'm selling the Grizzly Bear.
- Madame chérie!
There must be some misunderstanding.
But it is already announced in the paper- closed, finished!
I, Chambinni!
What about my reputation?
He's treating us like common actors.
We are artists!
But I'm sure Mr. Cornell would have consulted me before he did such a thing.
Impossible. Impossible!
Why, we haven't sing
Rigoletto, Traviata, Nibelungen!
Shh!
If you are not an American multimillionaire... why did you want opera?
You're cheap!
- Shut up!
- You needn't shout.
I'll shout all I want to.
You guys are pretty hard to convince.
If I weren't in my own home,
I'd throw you out... and maybe you'd get it through your thick skulls that you're canned, through!
- John, please.
- I know, and I'm sorry.
But there's no more money.
Even you can understand that.
You guys are just a bunch of second-rate hams.
I didn't know that when I first got into your game because I was out of my own neighborhood.
Well, I learned. All right. I backed a turkey, a flop, and I'm through.
- So get out!
- He can't talk to me like that! I'm Chambinni!
Get out!
Listen to me.
That was a pretty exhibition.
All you needed was the proper atmosphere- sawdust on the floor.
That's right, and if
I'd had sense enough... to stick by the Barbary Coast where I belong, I'd be a lot better off.
I thought I could raise you above it.
- I thought my father's prestige might-
- Your father!
I'm sick and tired of hearing about what your father did.
I'm fed up with his opera house... and the art museum he gave the city... and the big blowouts he used to throw for the Crockers and the Floods.
He had a gold mine.
I haven't.
But you've dug me for one ever since you married me.
Whatever made you think
I married you for any other reason?
I never told you I loved you.
I needed money, and you needed social position.
Well, I gave it to you.
I'll send the deed for the house over tomorrow.
That's all there is left.
And for worlds,
I wouldn't have missed knowing you.
All right.
You can drive on.
# Then my heart am a-pinin'#

# Gee, but it's great to meet a friend #

#When she takes you by the hand #
#There's a feeling you can understand #
# Oh, gee, but it's great to meet a friend #
#From your hometown #
# Now, friends, have you ever stopped to think #
#While you've been traveling here and there #
#What a great, big lonesome world #
#This seems to be #
#And how hard it is to find a pal #
# Say, who's really on the square #
# But now my world has changed #
#As you can see #
# Gee, but it's great to meet a friend #
# From your hometown #
# What difference does it make

#When she takes you by the hand #
#There's a feeling you can understand #

- #A friend from your hometown #
- # Isn't it wonderful #
#A-what a-difference does it make #
- # If he is up #
- # If she is up #
# Or down #
Oh!
What makes you so clumsy?
- Trudy! Oh, honey!
- Oh, Dan! How are you?
- I'm so glad to see you.
- Beulah!
Oh, you look wonderful!
Listen, sit down here, tell us all about it.
- Gee, I never was so happy in all my life!
- Oh!
Look at her.
Well, this is something, ain't it?
Here we all are, back at Sharkey's again.
- This is the last place I ever expected to find you.
- I don't blame you.
It's the only place we could get a job, and Sharkey only hires us...
'cause every time he gets cockeyed, he enjoys throwing us out again.
Yeah, all the fun's on his side.
But he hires us because he figures he can kick us out again... whenever he feels like putting on another brannigan.
Well, he's bounced you out for the last time. I'll take care of that.
Aw, thank you, honey. Gee, you know, we've been reading all about you.
We think it's swell.
I'm so happy for you, Trudy.
Mr. Cornell certainly did you a favor when he gave you the bounce...
for a ride on
that Croft merry-go-round. 
Yeah. After she took him for the gold ring, she even made him pay for the divorce.
Yeah. I heard about it.
He's down at the beach now, spieling for a hula concession...
and you're sittin'
on top of the world. 
Well, he still knows more about show business than anyone in San Francisco.
Oh, you're right, honey, but you can't do anything for the guy... because he won't let anybody do anything for him.
He figures that you're doing him a favor.
 Aw, but come on. 
Let's talk about you, Trudy. 
Gee, but you look pretty, honey. 
Hurry, hurry, hurry, ladies and gentlemen.
Step right up and buy your ticket.
The big show is about to commence.
Remember, gents, this is only the free exhibit on the outside.
Inside we have a show full of snappy dancing... hula girls straight from the coral strands of their South Sea island home.
Remember? It's the biggest show on the midway, and it's about to commence immediately.
Don't stand too close there, brother.
You'll bother the ladies.
See Princess Halikalani, her grass skirts waving in the breeze... like tropical palm trees.
Why, she alone is worth the price of admission, which is 10 cents.
The 10th part of a dollar. A two-dollar show for a dime. All right, girls.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, after you've blown your eyes to this show... if you don't admit it's the finest show on the midway, we will refund your money.
- Johnny, my boy!
- Sam!
Look, Johnny!
Gold watches.
Here. See how far you can throw it.
Are you loco?
Come over here.
Johnny, you're spoiling all the fun.
There's plenty more where these come from.
- Say, wait a minute. Did you hit it?
- Did I hit it?
Why, Johnny, there's some folks calls me Sam the Millionaire.
Why, ifJay Gould was to come up to San Francisco... he'd have to look me up if he wanted to buy a couple of gold mines.
If Alf Vanderbilt was looking for a partner to buy a railroad, he'd have to-
Wait a minute.
Was it on the grubstake I gave you?
Johnny, your grubstake had kittens.
Why, I got more gold than they got rice in China. Yes, sir. It's a Comstock.
Why, there's nuggets there you can pick up in your bare feet with your toes!
Yes, sir. Now here's a little chicken feed.
And if you want some real money... we can go down to Ralston's bank with a wheelbarrow.
- Just a moment. I gotta let this sink in.
- Take all the time you want.
Time and money's all we're gonna spend from now on.
No, there's something
I gotta take up where I left off.
Oh, if that's what you want, we can build our own house up on Nob Hill... with solid-gold fittings in the bathroom.
No, we won't. I was talking about the Barbary Coast.
Say, meet me at the Palace Hotel in an hour.
- This joint owes me 12 bucks. I wanna get it.
- You livin' at the Palace?
I will be by the time you get there.
 #Hello, my baby
Hello, my honey #
# Hello, my ragtime gal Send me a kiss by wire Baby, my heart's on fire #

# Send me a kiss by wire

- #If you refuse me, honey, you'll lose me #
- What is this, a gag?
Listen, Johnny, so help me. I've dug up every singer in this town that ain't working.
- And that's about the last one.
- ##
I'm sorry, miss, but you haven't got what it takes to sell a song in a concert hall.
- It wouldn't do either one of us any good. Thanks anyway.
- Who do you expect, Jenny Lind?
I put in a call for two other gals.
They might show up.
- Mr. Cornell, the foreman would like to see you.
- I'll be right with him.
If they're not any better than the ones you've shown me, forget them.
Listen, ifJohnny catches on, he's gonna hit the ceiling, and you're gonna hit the floor.
- Will you let me handle this my way?
- All right. Go ahead.
But pretending you can't find any girl singers... and havin' that phony gold miner throw brass watches away.
Well, it's my idea of playing with matches.
So that's your cue to do all the worrying.
- Go on back up there and leave me alone.
- All right, mallet head.
Mallet head?
Hello, Johnny my boy!
How's it going?
Looks like it's going pretty fast.
You opened the bar a little early, didn't you?
I thought it'd look better if the bottles weren't all full.
They're not gonna look so good all empty either.
- What's the trouble, Joe?
- About the cabinet, Mr. Cornell.
- How do you want these doors hung?
- Let me see the layout.
You better put 'em on slides so they don't interfere with the bar fixture here.
Now, Johnny, that ain't nice.
I'm sober as a jaybird.
Nothing interferes with me.
Just pass you out all the money you want. Them's my orders.
- What are you talking about?
- Where the gold's coming from, son.
But I know a place in the Sierras... where there's nuggets like fleas on a dog's back... just itchin' to be scratched.
- And all for me and you, Johnny.
- You can have it.
I told you, I'm only using your money till I get started. Then you'll get it back.
You don't have to pay me back, son.
It ain't my gold dust.
- It doesn't belong-
- Sure. What are you talkin' about payin' him back?
You grubstaked him. Go on. Suck on that bottle and plug up your mouth.
Nobody gets anything out of me.
I'm tight as an oyster.
- Guy's bleary as a hoot owl. He's talkin' through his hat.
- Where were we, Joe?
Oh, by the way, Johnny. A new singer just came in. I'd like for you to hear her.
- Sure. Put her on.
- Don't you want to see her?
All I have to do is listen to her, and I can do that from here.
- But all this noise!
- I said I can hear her. Put her on.
All right.
You'd better put a partition here so it'll support the shelves.
- Yes, sir.
- There's something else I want to check while you're here.

Say, that girl's got a voice that really gets you.
Yeah. She's all right.
You better put some extra men on these doors.
We haven't got much time.
- Yes, sir.
- Johnny, what do you say? Can you use her?
- Hello, Johnny.
- Hello.
Are you lucky. Not a gal in this town that can sing without tripping over her tonsils... and in walks Trudy looking for a job.
It's quite a coincidence, isn't it?
Yeah. You can have her for $200 a week.
That's a pretty big drop from 2,000.
I'm afraid she's a little out of my class.
No, I'm not. I'm laying off for the summer anyway, and I wouldn't mind taking a cut.
I'm sorry, Trudy, but I couldn't ask you to.
Oh, what are you talking about, Johnny?
The Grizzly Bear wouldn't be the same without Trudy with us.
- We'll get along.
- Oh, John, you-
Johnny, I know you can get along without me... but I don't want you to.
I want to help. You and Dan and Beulah mean more to me than anything-
Sorry, Trudy, but it still goes.
I can't use you.
I couldn't let you come back and work for beer and pretzels when that's all I had to offer you.
I'm on my own now.
I don't need anything from anybody.
What are you gonna do with a guy like that?
He'd give his right eye to get you back, but he won't give in to himself.
Stubborn.

- Great show, Johnny. Best on the coast.
- Thank you, Frank.
- Congratulations. You sure put it over.
- Much obliged.
- You certainly do know how to put on a show, Johnny.
- Thanks a lot.
- Comin' back to the Grizzly. Like old times again.
- Congratulations, Johnny.
- Good work. Thank you, fellas.
- Johnny!
Come on. Have a drink with your old card Sam.
- You've had about enough, haven't you?
- Me?
Why, Johnny, I could drink prussic acid out of my own boat.
Wouldn't have no more effect on me than bird meal.
- What are you gonna have, Johnny?
- Seltzer, please.
Straight bourbon.
Johnny, you're lookin' at the man... who's got the greatest gold strike in the Sierras... all lined up.
You've cracked about that once before.
- You have all you need now, haven't you?
- Johnny, that's nothin'.
All the ones you and me didn't get ain't nothin' because this time we can't miss.
Why, I'll get you back every little grubstake you ever give me.
- And all I need is-
- What are you getting at?
Gold, son!
This time we'll hit it!
Where'd you get all that money you've been giving me?
Come on, answer me!
Where did you get it!
- L-
- Where'd you get it?
Oh, now, don't get mad, son.
What's the difference if that little gal of yours stakes you?
Why, we'll pay her back.
We'll get nuggets by the buckets.
- So it was Trudy. Why didn't you tell me?
- Johnny, don't take it so-
Get out!
Go on! Get out ofhere!
Stay out ofhere!
Give me a chord there, Professor.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
I just wanna tell you how wonderful it is to be back at the Grizzly... and how swell it is to have you back here with us.
But there was someone missing in the show tonight- the little lady that used to give you her heart with every song.
She's in the audience. Let her know you want her,
she'll be up here like she used to be. 
I refer to San Francisco's own, the one and only Trudy Evans!
And now, folks, there's someone else we can't forget on this reopening night.
The one who gave you
the Grizzly Bear. 
The one who, when he gets up here, will bring us all back together again... the impresario of the Barbary Coast,
Johnny Cornell!
Hit it!
Curtain!

Slow down for a minute, will you, please, Jenkins?
All right. Go ahead. Thank you.
- Where are we, Jenkins?
- Fifth Avenue, sir.
- I see that. But why are we here?
- This is your wedding anniversary.
Oh, of course, of course, my 15th.
Delightful occasion.
Thank you, Jenkins.
- Good morning, Mr. Cortland.
- I'd like to get a bracelet.
Diamond, of course. Here we are.
Is this something like we have in mind? Or perhaps this?
Oh, that's beautiful.
- I'll take that.
- Fine. That's my preference.
Will there be anything else?
No, thank you. Oh, yes, I wanna get something for my wife too.
- How much is this?
- Seven dollars.
Will you put this in one of your boxes?
- Yes.
- Incidentally, what is it?
- It's a Chinese backscratcher.
- Always wanted to have one of those.
- Shall we send it, sir?
- No, I'll give it to her myself.
- And about the bracelet, sir.
- I want that engraved.
Yes, and to whom?
To my dear, sweet...
- May I use your telephone, please?
- Of course, right over there.
I'll have her name for you in just a minute.
- The boss wants you on the phone.
- Thanks. I'm through with this table, Joe.
Someone's still a beat off.
- Hello, chief.
- What's the name of that pretty girl...
...in the front line of the modern group?
The new one with the dimples on her knee?
Oh, Sheila Winthrop.
Yeah, that's right.
- Miss Winthrop.
- Yes, Mr. Curtis.
There's nothing I admire more than independence...
...but sometimes it can be carried too far.
Our group is known for absolute precision.
All the other girls are doing this dance one way and you another.
I'm sorry. But I don't know that part of the routine.
- Would you like to try it with me?
- I'd love to.
Tommy, let's have the second 24 bars.
Ready? One and two and...
Tommy, let's have the second 24 bars.
Ready? One and two and...
- That's much better, thank you.
- Thank you.
All right, now listen, kids.
I want the whole number.
Places, please.
It's "Boogie Barcarolle," from the top.
I'll do it with you. Are you ready?
Music. Now, give me some nice straight lines, please. Go.
That's it. Take five minutes.
Sheila.
- Who do you think you're kidding?
- I don't know what you mean.
- You know that dance routine.
- That's right.
Then why do you muff it when Mr. Curtis is around?
- Because I like to dance with him.
- Is that all?
- I like the way he talks.
- Is that all?
- I like his personality.
- Is that all?
- Isn't that enough?
- Don't get your hopes up, dear.
- Why not?
- For eight hours a day, Mr. Curtis...
...is up to his hips in pretty girls.
And we all look alike to him.
- Really?
- Yes. To a hungry man, a lamb chop...
...is a tasty dish. But to the butcher, it's just a hunk of meat.
Mr. Cortland wants to see you in his office.
- I take it all back, dear.
- Thank you, Mr. Curtis.
- What do you take back, Marge?
- A remark I made about lamb chops.
- What do you take back, Marge?
- A remark I made about lamb chops.
Come in.
- You sent for me, Mr. Cortland?
- Yes, I thought we might have a chat.
- Won't you sit down, please?
- Thank you.
- You know that I own this theatre?
- Yes, I do.
Fine. Fine.
- I took an interest in your work.
- Really?
So much so that this morning
I was walking down Fifth Avenue...
...I saw something rather beautiful that reminded me of you.
I wanted you to have it very much, and so I bought it for you.
This couldn't be a diamond bracelet, could it?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it's engraved.
"To my dear, sweet Sheila."
Something I thought of.
- How lovely.
- We do understand each other, don't we?
- Yes, we do, don't we?
- Good.
Now, I've got a little plan.
I'm sorry.
- Hello?
- Mrs. Cortland is on her way in.
Thank you, Cummings.
- I'm terribly sorry about this.
- I quite understand.
Maybe this way would be better.
- You are lovely, my dear.
- Thank you, Mr. Cortland.
Oh, thank you, Miss Winthrop.
We'll consider the proposition closed then.
I'm thinking of putting her under long-term contract.
She's an old friend of the family.
My family.
Her father and my father, you know.
Like that:
- She's beautiful, isn't she?
- Who?
Oh, she? In a superficial sort of way.
Will you stop looking at me like that?
- Like what?
- You ought to know, you're doing it.
Do we have to fight on our wedding anniversary?
- How did you happen to remember that?
- Well, Jenkins told me.
Very thoughtful of Jenkins.
I was thoughtful too.
I bought you a present.
It's in my coat pocket, if you wanna go and look for it.
Oh. Oh, it's lovely, Martin.
- Interesting gadget, isn't it?
- Gadget?
- Yes, it's to scratch your back.
- Scratch your back?
Yes, it's Chinese. You scratch it up and down and crosswise.
What on earth are you talking about?
Oh, wait a minute,
I'll show you how it works.
- Where did you get that?
- Out of your pocket.
- My dear, there has been a mistake.
- I see. Who is "dear, sweet Sheila"?
The girl that just went out.
Don't jump to conclusions.
No, no, I won't.
We'll take it nice and easy.
But, Julia, you do not understand.
No, I know I don't, dear.
But I will when you explain.
- I bought that for Robert Curtis.
- Should look lovely on him.
Don't be ridiculous.
Robert is crazy about Miss Winthrop.
He asked me to pick a present out for her. So I did. See?
I'm disappointed in you. There was a time when your alibis were gems.
- Remember the Russian dancer?
- She was Portuguese.
Before you talked your way out of that, you rewrote the Arabian Nights.
Now you've lost your imagination.
I'm getting bored with you.
Bored? Is it my fault you reached into the wrong pocket?
You started the whole thing. That's the trouble around here, no privacy.
People reaching into wrong pockets.
No organization.
How's a man to run a theatre?
- Is this what you intended for me?
- Yes.
As a matter of fact, you know, that's quite a collector's item.
Ming dynasty.
But it also has its practical side.
You can scratch yourself in all sorts of places.
I imagine.
Oh, you're very thoughtful, Martin.
I'm sure Miss Winthrop will agree.
You don't believe me then?
Oh, of course I do.
But that's because I know you so well.
I'm just wondering how your story will sound to 12 strange men.
Twelve strange men.
Twelve strange men. She's batty.
What's 12 strange men got to do with this? Football team, 11 men.
A baseball team, nine.
Symphony orchestra, 100 men.
Twelve men.
A jury!
Robert, prepare yourself for a shock.
Julia's going to divorce me.
- I'll be first to congratulate her.
- How can you say that?
You know I don't want a divorce.
I'm happily married. I love my wife.
And besides, all this property is in her name.
She's gonna strip me right down to my underwear too.
You ought to think of that before you gallop after...
...something you can't catch.
Who is it this time?
Sheila Winthrop. I bought her this, and my wife found it in my pocket.
I imagine you had a good reason for buying that.
- I certainly did. We're good friends.
- Oh, I see.
- Besides, it's none of your business.
- I agree with you.
- Wait, you're in this too, you know.
- Me? What have I to do with it?
I told Julia you bought this for Sheila and that you were in love with her.
Oh, you did, did you?
I'm going to tell her differently.
You don't have to.
She doesn't believe it anyway.
Please, you've got to help me.
If you get me out of this jam, it'll never happen again.
No more galloping, I swear it.
Please, Robert?
- All right, what do you want me to do?
- Well, it's very simple.
I'll take Julia to the Crystal Roof for our anniversary dinner.
You bring Sheila and prove to my wife that you are in love with Sheila.
What? Well, what would Sheila think?
Make her believe it too.
If she doesn't, Julia won't.
That won't be difficult.
She has a friendly disposition.
Turn on the old charm, you know.
Fascinate her.
Do anything so long as you make my wife...
...believe I was telling the truth when I lied to her.
Is that all?
If you get a chance, you might put in a good word for me with Sheila.
Hello.
I said, hello.
Oh, hello.
I'm sorry. For a minute,
I was a long way off.
- Have a nice trip?
- Wonderful.
I'm glad you came back.
Incidentally, you dance beautifully.
- You didn't think so at rehearsal.
- Oh, that.
Confidentially, Sheila, I'm delighted every time you make a mistake.
I get a chance to dance with you.
Confidentially, I make mistakes for the same reason.
Good evening, Mr. Cortland.
What are you looking for?
Me? Nothing.
Why should I be looking for anything?
- Thanks, Sheila. It was lovely.
- That's your fault.
Look! There are Robert and Sheila.
- Oh, how surprising.
- Let's go over and say hello.
Just to be polite.
Just for a minute.
- Oh, Robert.
- Hello, Martin. Hello, Julia.
- Well, this is a surprise.
- Is it?
- Of course it is.
- Want to sit down?
Thank you. That's nice of you.
We have a table over here.
Way back is the best we could get.
I hope we're not gonna crowd you.
Sheila, how rude of me.
You know Miss Winthrop, Julia?
- Yes. How do you do, Miss Winthrop?
- How do you do?
It was outside of my husband's office, wasn't it?
I'm glad you both dropped by.
I was just about to...
- You first, Robert.
- Thank you.
I was gonna say,
I'm glad you both dropped by.
It makes a very pleasant occasion even more so.
Yes, doesn't it? And it's our
15th wedding anniversary too.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Robert, did you happen to see the lovely present Martin gave me?
- It was a backscratcher, Chinese.
- Ming dynasty. Ming.
When we were first married, it was orchids. Now it's a backscratcher.
Try and scratch your back with an orchid, I always say.
It seems to be a special occasion for both of us.
How did you like your present, my dear?
What present do you mean?
That's a funny thing about orchids.
I was talking to a guy the other day who breeds... Raises orchids.
He said he couldn't do...
You gotta make so much difference about the yellow ones. But...
Martin, what in the world are you doing?
- I'm tying my shoe.
- Try doing it with both hands.
- Well, what were we talking about?
- The present Robert gave Miss Winthrop.
Julia, can't you keep a secret?
I was saving this as a surprise, but now that you know it...
...I hope you like it.
- This couldn't be a diamond bracelet?
- Open it.
"To my dear, sweet Sheila."
The funny thing was that when my wife found that in my pocket...
...she thought that I was the one who bought it for you.
How could you possibly think such a thing?
Because I know Martin.
Do you like it, Sheila?
Like it? It's wonderful. It's the most gorgeous thing I ever saw!
Now what do you think,
Miss Susie Suspicious?
Ask me later.
Oh, Mr. Curtis, this is the nicest thing that ever happened to me.
- May I call you Robert?
- Please do.
Oh, I'm so deliriously happy.
I don't know what to do!
Oh, yes I do! I'm going to phone all my relatives.
- Sheila!
- Mr. Cortland...
...who is that with Mr. Curtis?
- Miss Sheila Winthrop.
- Oh, Winthrop. A romance?
- Yes. They're practically engaged.
You can quote her as being deliriously happy.
- Thank you.
- Ming dynasty.
"New romance in show world.
Robert Curtis and Sheila Winthrop."
And then it goes on:
"The announcement will be a surprise to the many friends...
...of the famous choreographer who is directing...
...the numbers for the modern revue at the Cortland Theatre."
What else does it say, Louise?
That's about all, except you are quoted as being "deliriously happy."
Who do you suppose put that in the paper?
Mr. Curtis, naturally.
And that's carrying things too far.
You'd think he'd quit after what I did to him last night.
- Did he know you were doing it?
- Of course.
He must have known
I was trying to embarrass him.
Apparently that newspaper article was to even things up.
- How do you know it was him?
- I'd believe anything of him.
I thought I liked him once.
Now I know the gentleman.
Hello? Who?
Tom! Of course she is.
It's your captain.
Tom, dear, where are you?
You mean to say you left the Army to run itself?
I've been transferred to Camp Weston near where my mother lives.
I was going to ask you and
Louise to visit us for a while.
That sounds delightful.
Why don't you?
That was before I read this morning's paper.
You mean it isn't so?
There's still a chance for me?
Fine! I'll be right up!
Hey! Why don't you watch where you're going?
You're the first driver who chased a man after he'd already missed him.
- Hey, buddy, who's car is that?
- Mine.
Parked it right next to a fire hydrant.
That wasn't there when I parked!
Oh, I'm sure it wasn't.
Every time it rains...
...those fireplugs pop out of the sidewalk like mushrooms.
What's your name?
Put it over here.
Let that be a lesson to you.
And that's what happened.
It was all part of a game.
I see. This Curtis fella pitched and you caught.
Before the party broke up, she did some pitching of her own.
- I'd say the score was even.
- I wouldn't.
Hello? Who is it?
Oh, just a minute, please.
Mr. Robert Curtis is in the lobby.
Should I tell him to go away?
No, tell him to come up.
It'll save me a trip to the theatre.
Will you come up, Mr. Curtis?
He sounded upset.
- I'd like to really upset him.
- You would?
You two wait in the other room.
I'll handle this.
All right, come along, Tom.
Come in.
- What about this story in the paper?
- What about it?
You took a lot for granted announcing we were engaged.
- You're saying you didn't announce it?
- I certainly am. Why would I?
What would I gain by such a ridiculous story?
That's the fella who almost hit me on the street. Do you have a gun?
But how can we get rid of his body?
- Never mind that. Just give me the gun.
- All right.
- Here.
- Oh.
I don't care who put it in the paper as long as you know we're not engaged.
May I compliment you on your chivalry.
I imagine the bracelet will more than make up for your hurt feelings.
- I'm going in and you can't keep me!
- No, no, Tom!
Stand aside, I know my duty.
- You, sir.
- Tom!
- What are you doing here?
- I came to attend a wedding.
There's gonna be one.
I tried to keep him out.
You know your brother's temper.
But, brother, dear, you don't understand.
Yes, I do. I heard every word he said, the dirty, no-good Yankee!
- Say, what's this all about?
- Honour, sir. My sister's honour!
- All I did was give her a bracelet.
- You admit you bought it?
- I didn't buy it.
- Then you stole it?
No, somebody gave it to me, and I gave it to her.
You did that and you still refuse to marry her, sir?
- I said we are not engaged!
- That's all I want to hear.
- Sheila!
- Darling.
- Yes?
- Sorry, Mr. Cortland. No news yet.
Fine thing! I own the theatre.
I shoulder all the responsibilities.
I pay all the salaries.
I ask one simple question.
I wanna find out how much
Robert Curtis weighs.
- And what's the answer?
- I don't know.
- I'm about to be sued, shot or sabotaged.
- Who's gonna do all this?
Sheila's brother has some silly notion about me and Sheila.
He's after me with the biggest gun ever.
- It's just a badger game.
- Just a badger game.
It serves you right for getting mixed up with women.
Serves me right? You caused it all!
Don't try to implicate me in your sordid affairs. I'm a married man.
This is serious. You've got to help me out of this mess.
The fella is gonna shoot me.
- Lf he shoots you, I'll fire Sheila.
- That'll be a big help.
Then get a gun and shoot right back at him.
I should call the district attorney.
Get this theatre mixed up in a scandal?
No, I'm in trouble enough already.
- Robert, they're gonna draft you.
- Draft me? How do you know?
I found this. You're to report to the Medical Board this afternoon.
- Everything happens to me.
- Drafted. Wow!
- I beg your pardon?
- That's the solution to my problems.
Don't be selfish. I can't run this theatre without you. Think of me.
I've had enough of you, your theatre and your schemes.
- Besides, the Army needs me.
- Oh, not as much as I need you.
What makes you so sure you can pass that examination?
- How much do you weigh?
- I don't know.
We'll soon find out. We'll get you on these scales in here, my boy.
We'll settle this right now.
Just as I thought, five pounds underweight. My troubles are over.
- No five pounds are holding me back.
- I'm going with you.
Oh, no, you're not.
- Next man, corporal.
- Yes, sir.
Robert Curtis.
Everything's fine so far.
Now all we have to do is check your height and weight.
- Take off your hat.
- I'm sorry, sir, I just had a shampoo.
- Take off your hat!
- Yes, sir.
Stop that jiggling.
I must've caught a chill.
If I could put my hat on.
No hat. Stand still.
Yes. Now? All right.
- Do you think you can you stand still?
- Yes, sir, I'm okay now, doc.
That's funny, I'd have said you were five pounds under.
I fool them all, doc.
All right. Report to Camp Weston.
You'll leave from Grand Central Station.
Thanks a lot, doc.
You say Little Neck, Long Neck,
Great Neck, Connecticut.
All I wanna know is when my brother, she's arrive.
I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you wanna know.
He's not so smart.
- Can you please give me information?
- Thank goodness you speak English.
We're going to Camp Weston.
Would it be better to take a train...
...and go to Cattaras, or make a change and go from there?
Why, yes, I... What was that again?
Is it better to take a train to Cattaras, or would it be better in the morning?
I don't understand you.
I'll put it another way.
We're going to Camp Weston.
- You understand that?
- Yes.
Is it better to take a train and go all the way to Cattaras...
...or be forced to take the midnight special?
- Shall I repeat that?
- No, please, don't.
- Where are you going?
- I wanna get one of these folders.
- I'll see you later.
- How long does it take to Camp Weston?
Okay, soldier.
Take a train and go to Cattaras.
You'll find this fighter force and get there on time.
- How's that again?
- I said take a train to Cattaras.
Don't change, find a place in the centre.
You'll find it a lot sooner.
Oh, you mean...
In plenty of time.
No, l... What did you say?
I said, I thought you said they probably have it near Camp Weston...
...especially on Tuesdays.
A comedian, huh?
Farewell, our hero
Well. Hi, Francis.
Slave driver sublime
I don't believe it. Hi, Jerry.
Don't be like Nero

Halt!
All right. All right. Now.
Who's making patty-cake with the feet?
- Was it you?
- Why, sergeant.
- You?
- Wasn't me.
- Were you doing it?
- Doing what?
- That.
- Oh, you mean this?
Say, you're not bad.
But don't do it again!
The supply officer wants to see you right away.
- I'll be right with you.
- Right.
Any of you men have any experience drilling?
- I have.
- March the detail to the drill field.
Hey, buddy, come here.
Put this in my tent.
Right shoulder arms!
Right face. Forward march.
Backward march.
Halt! Right face, forward march.
Backward march.
Right turn and face me slowly.
Left. In the rear right.
Back. Forward.
About face.
Right. Set apart. Left face.
Forward. Halt!
Look, do I have to keep telling you to go to the right...
...when I want you to go to the banks?
Don't counter it. Go.
Forward march.
On the double.
- On the double.
- On the double.
Now you're getting it.
Razzle-dazzle.
Halt!
I thought you said you had some experience in drilling.
I did. I used to work for the city. Street department.
Back in the ranks!
- What's the matter?
- Can't a guy get some sleep here?
It's that Curtis guy again.
Why don't you go to bed?
Get some sleep.
Quiet!
Hey, Swivel Tongue, you got a match?
I can't find my sleeping pills.
I'll get you a light.
Hey. I borrowed your flashlight.
- I said...
- Oh.
Oh, there they are.
Hey, you can't take those without a chaser.
Give me that cup.
I'll get you some water.
Oh, thanks, Swiv.
What's the matter with you?
- Quiet, fellas.
- Why don't you be quiet.
Hi, buddy.
What are you doing there?
I'm just getting some water...
Oh.
Watch.
Thanks, Swiv.
I tripped.
- I brought you back your flashlight.
- What?
- Your face is wet.
- Oh, go away and let me alone.
I was only trying to...
I brought back...
Ow!
Hey! I borrowed your flashlight again.
- What happened?
- I sat on this. It was in my bed.
- "You left town so quickly..."
- Go away, will you? Go on.
Hey, Swiv. Swiv, where are you?
- I don't know. I'm in the dark.
- Quiet!
Come here.
Let's have that light, will you?
"I didn't get to give this back to you.
Inasmuch as I refused it when
Mr. Cortland tried to give it to me...
...I see no reason why I should take it from you.
Sheila Winthrop.
P.S. May I compliment you again on your..."
- Chivalry.
- "Chivalry." Who's Sheila Winthrop?
I didn't realize it before, but she is a very sweet young lady.
That's the first time I ever heard of a rabbit giving a carrot back.
I just want to tell you I won't need your flashlight anymore.
Look here, Swivel Tongue.
If you come near me...
- Quiet!
- You guys be quiet.
It's him. He's making all the noise.
You'll wake everybody up.
One, two, ten.
- I'm a heel. That's what I am, a heel.
- Shut up, you heel!
Ouch! Ouch!
Ouch, ouch! Ouch!
- Ouch! Ouch!
- What's going on here?
- Come on. Get up. Wake up.
- Stop him.
Get up. Wake up.
Come on, come out of it.
So you'll hit me too, will you?
Two days in the guardhouse.
If you ask me, you got off easy.
- But I tell you, I wasn't drinking.
- You gave a good imitation of it.
I was just having a bad dream.
He kept jabbing at me with that pitchfork. The last thing I remember...
- There he is again!
- Hey you!
Say. Wait a minute.
- That's for the pitchfork.
- You'll get 10 years for this.
I just wanted to tell you that I'm really not Miss Winthrop's brother.
- What happened in New York was a gag.
- That gun was no gag.
- It wasn't loaded.
- I don't like your sense of humour.
You better keep away because every time I see you, I'll bop you.
- Do you know who that man is?
- No, and what's more, I don't care.
Okay, buddy, I'm gonna let you find out all by yourself.
- Mrs. Barton?
- Yes. I'm looking for my son.
- I'll tell Captain Barton you're here.
- Thank you.
Tom will be so glad to see you.
I hope. He spent his leave convincing us to come here instead of Florida.
Don't let her fool you. She could hardly wait to get out of New York.
Captain Barton sends his regrets.
He'll be delayed a few minutes.
- Where's the music coming from?
- From the guardhouse, ma'am.
- Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am.
Evening
Creeping down the mountain
Wak es up Mr. Firefly
Firefly
Bullfrog sitting there
Starts a-croakin' but I don't care
Since I kissed my baby goodbye
Baby goodbye
South wind
Shak es the whole magnolia
Moon Man lights the dingy sky
The dingy sky
Stars start sprinkling gold on the river
But still I'm cold
Since I kissed my baby goodbye
Since my baby and me
Parted company
I can't see what's the diff
If I live or I die
Oh, Lord I've tak en
Such a beating in the hood
Even cheating
Since I kissed my baby goodbye
Since my baby and me
Parted company
I can't see what's the diff
If I live or I die
Say, soldier. You're a beat off.
- Sheila, what are you doing here?
- What are you doing there?
I joined the Army.
I see.
From penthouse to guardhouse.
I got your letter and bracelet.
- I can't tell you how badly...
- Do you like it down here?
- The Army? It's wonderful.
- No. I mean the guardhouse.
I'm not a prisoner. I'm inspecting the place. It's part of a captain's duty.
Captain Curtis. How democratic of you to wear a private's uniform.
This is temporary. My tent burned and I had to order new uniforms.
Someday, you're going to tell the truth, and you'll feel like a new man.
Sheila, how can I see you again?
Keep sitting at that window, and one of these days I might be passing by.
- Where are you staying?
- Fallbrook Farm.
May I call on you?
Yes, indeed, captain. As soon as your new uniforms get here.
Sheila.
But I tell you, borrowing a captain's uniform isn't healthy.
- What's health compared to romance?
- Yeah?
What's romance to a court-martial?
Lmpersonating an officer is serious.
It's worth the risk. If you'll shut up,
I'll figure how he can get a uniform.
Even if he does, it won't fool anyone.
- Curtis knows that.
- Do you think he ought to chance it?
I know the girl ain't gonna be fooled by a uniform.
She will be impressed if Curtis risks trying to show up in one.
Now, all we gotta do is figure out how he can get a uniform and...
- Hey, Curtis.
- How in the world did you get that?
I've got a pull around here.
Besides, nobody was looking.
- Boy, am I worried.
- Wish me luck, boys. I'm on my way.
Just like Don Juan.
Boy, ain't romance beautiful?
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- I came to see Miss Winthrop.
- I expect her back any moment.
Won't you come in, Captain...?
- Curtis.
- Come in, Captain Curtis.
I was just about to have some tea.
Won't you join me?
- Thank you.
- I'm sure Sheila won't be long.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.
- Was she expecting you?
- Well, yes.
I don't think I've met you before,
Captain Curtis.
I just got here.
I was sent from Washington to make a general survey of Army camps.
How interesting! Sit and tell me about it.
You were sent from Washington.
I'm to recommend how to improve living conditions for new selectees.
- Indeed. Sugar?
- Thank you.
You see, the enlisted man is the backbone of the Army.
And sometimes officers are not as considerate as I think they should be.
Robert, what in the world...?
You said call when I got my new uniform. Like it?
- Well, Mother.
- This is my son, Captain Barton.
- Did you say "Captain Barton"?
- Yes. How are you, Captain Curtis?
Not very well.
Captain Curtis was sent from Washington, dear.
He's reporting on the relationship between enlisted men and officers.
Is that so?
That must be the others.
Will you let them in, Tom?
I invited some of his friends for tea.
Will you excuse me?
- This isn't another gag, is it?
- I'm afraid it isn't.
Why didn't you warn me?
How did I know you'd be silly enough to try a thing like this?
Where's the back door?
Captain Curtis.
I want you to meet my friends,
Captain Nolan and Captain Williams.
- How do you do?
- You know Miss Winthrop.
- Yes.
- How do you do?
I'm so sorry we're late, Mrs. Barton, but somebody stole my coat.
Dreadful. I hope this doesn't give you the wrong impression of our camp.
No, not at all. I'm sure the man who took it is already suffering for it.
Captain Curtis has been sent from
Washington. To investigate us.
Is that so? Tell us, captain, how do you find conditions here?
Splendid, splendid.
The officers are all fine men.
And very lenient with the selectees,
I hope.
Have you investigated our guardhouses, captain?
Not completely. I expect to spend much more time there.
Tell me. What action would you recommend in the case...
...of a private stealing a captain's coat?
- Well, I wouldn't have him shot.
- You wouldn't?
No, that's much too drastic. Besides, it would spoil him for active duty.
What would you recommend?
I'd throw him in the guardhouse until he learned. Which wouldn't take long.
- Yes. A perfect recommendation.
- Thank you.
If you gentlemen will excuse me,
I have an important engagement.
- Goodbye, Mrs. Barton. Thank you.
- I'll take you to the door.
- Do you realize the trouble you're in?
- Who is this Captain Barton?
A friend. Aunt Louise and I are visiting his mother.
- How good a friend?
- A very good friend.
But this is no time to discuss that.
You're in a bad situation.
I certainly am. While I'm in the guardhouse, he'll see you every day.
He's a nice young man. I hope he gives our camp a good report.
It won't be so bad, if you arrange to pass my window every day.
You're saying nice things again.
What's Mr. Cortland up to now?
Cortland hasn't anything to do with it. This time, I mean everything.
And this time,
I still don't believe a word of it.
I don't blame you.
Sheila, I'm sorry for everything that happened in New York.
How about starting over again from there?
Would you do that?
Well, yes. We could try if you're sure you'd like to.
I was never so sure of anything in my life. Goodbye.
Bye.
Where does the captain wish to go?
To the guardhouse.
And don't call me captain.
- Welcome home, Curtis.
- We were expecting you.
Hi, fellas.
Here, my good man. Take this back to the officers' quarters, and let me in.
- You haven't done anything.
- That's what you think.
What are you in for?
We fought a rear guard battle for you and got five days.
- Oh, that's a shame.
- How long are you in for?
Brother, I don't know, and I don't care.
I'm a man that's in love.
Yes, sir.
Hey, Curtis. There they are again. Same time every day for the last two weeks.
They're 10 minutes late today, by my watch.
Cheer up, Curtis. I'm getting out in a few months. I'll give her your love.
I wish you'd shut up.
Why don't you wish for a pardon and a horse?
All right, Curtis. Come on.
- What's up?
- Colonel Shiller wants to see you.
- About what?
- We forgot to ask him.
Ain't that awful? Come on.
Although we've received cooperation from men in your profession...
...this is quite the most generous offer we've had.
It's purely selfish, sir.
I just wanted to feel that I am having a part in this great work that you are doing.
Bringing your show down here certainly proves that.
Our obligation to the boys includes more than just teaching them to march.
Pvt. Curtis reporting to the colonel from the guardhouse.
- Bring him in.
- Yes, sir. Come in.
At ease, Pvt. Curtis.
- I think you know Mr. Cortland.
- Yes.
- Hello, Martin.
- Robert.
Mr. Cortland will bring his entire company from New York to put on a show.
- That's very generous of him, sir.
- Oh, not at all.
Do you think you could forego being a pioneer resident of the guardhouse...
...long enough to assist him?
- Oh, I'm sure of it, sir.
So the shock of being away from the guardhouse won't be too great...
...you will continue to spend your nights there.
- Yes, sir.
- Well, thanks again, Mr. Cortland.
Thank you, Colonel Shiller.
Have you arranged your quarters?
No, I haven't, but I'm gonna look around today.
I have an apartment in town you can use.
Robert, that's very nice. Thank you.
Inasmuch as Pvt. Curtis won't be using it.
Good day, colonel.
That'll be all, Curtis.
Now, what's your real idea in doing this show in camp?
Why, I'm surprised at you.
You know I've always wanted to do something for the government.
You'd think I was getting something out of this.
- Only my services for nothing.
- What do you mean, for nothing?
The government pays you $21 a month.
Where does that money come from?
The taxpayers. I'm a taxpayer.
- Let me thank you, Martin.
- Don't mention it.
If I didn't hate that guardhouse so much,
I wouldn't even be talking to you.
What are they for, to keep you from swiping medals?
Part of my deal with the government.
They wouldn't let you out except under guard.
Every time you get an idea, something happens to me.
All right. I'm your man.
The show is on.
I'll tell you why. Next door lives a little lady who's going to dance with me.
- Little lady? Who?
- Miss Sheila Winthrop.
Sheila Winthrop? Up here?
Robert, you don't want her.
Why, she's a dangerous character.
She almost broke me up with my wife.
Besides, I promised the part to somebody else.
Now it comes out.
I thought I recognized that look in your eye. Who is it now?
Well, she's a very nice little item named Sonya. A gorgeous creature.
I've given her my word...
Give her a bracelet instead, because Sonya isn't dancing in this show.
Robert, my pal...
You promised there'd be no more galloping over rooftops.
This is different.
She's a foreigner.
What's different?
A gallop is a gallop in any language.
Hey! This way.
Hey, sergeant, bring me in a house, will you? Right here. Put it here.
And I want a tree right here.
That's right.
Let me see, now...
Hey, boys! Bring in the ocean, will you?
That's right. Come on!
- Okay. Sergeant, is Miss Winthrop ready?
- Yes, she's ready.
That Miss Winthrop, she is so beautiful, and I hate her so much!
When will Mr. Curtis put me in her place?
Any day, Sonya.
I'm working on a new angle.
A new angle, old angle, this angle, that angle.
I want to dance, and all you do is "angle" me.
- Now, listen, you trust me, don't you?
- No.
Well, that's ridiculous.
Everybody trusts me.
My dear, I've a feeling you are
So near and yet so far
You appear lik e a radiant star
First so near
Then again so far
I just start getting you k een on
Clinches galore with me
When fate steps in on the scene
And mops up the floor with me
No wonder I'm a bit under par
For you're so near
And yet so far
My condition is only so-so
'Cause whenever I feel you're close, oh
You turn out to be
Oh, so far
- Sheila, you're wonderful.
- That's because you're a good teacher.
What's wonderful about you isn't anything I taught you.
What's wonderful about you is you.
That's bracelet talk.
Sure it is, but not the way you think it is.
That bracelet happens to mean an awful lot to me. It brought us together.
Well, that's one way of looking at it.
That's the way I look at it.
I bought it from Martin.
You did?
Robert, you're one of the most charming men I've ever known.
And the most unconvincing.
Oh, Captain Curtis, are we too late to see the rehearsals?
No, we're starting again in a few moments.
I'd like to speak to Sheila if you can spare her.
Yes, sir. Of course.
For a few minutes.
- I have something to tell her.
- Tom is being transferred to Panama.
Come on, Sheila.
I'll tell you all about it.
Isn't it wonderful? After all these years, they're going to be married.
What?
- I didn't know a thing about it.
- He's going to ask her now.
- Do you think she might say yes?
- Of course.
Our family's been planning it for years.
Don't look so upset, Capt. Curtis.
They won't be leaving for Panama until after your show is over.
Pardon me, please.
I have to change my clothes.
Oh, Robert?
Wait a minute, please.
One more chance to save my wife from a terrible fate. Sonya's threatening...
You're wasting your breath.
Where's that bracelet?
It's in your apartment, in my suitcase.
Sonya is... Where are you going?
To my apartment. Say one more word, and I'll throw those bloodhounds at you.
To the apartment.
After all I've done for him.
After all these...
Hey, I changed the name on the bracelet!
Say, that's fine. I'm a genius!
I'll bring them together again, and your conscience will be clear.
But I don't worry about my conscience.
I only worry about my career.
You let me do the worrying, huh?
All right. I let you do the worrying, but if your plan doesn't work...
Oh, it will work, believe me.
I wouldn't be mixed up in a thing like this.
It's pretty low, you know.
But it's a national emergency, my dear.
Well, Sheila?
- Aunt Louise, Tom proposed to me.
- Yes.
And out of the clear sky,
I realized I was in love with Robert.
Did you tell Tom?
Not yet. Tom asked me not to give him my answer until tonight.
What an eventful day this is.
When did Robert ask you to marry him?
He hasn't yet...
...but I think he will.
I suspected something like that.
I've been married three times.
- Four.
- That's right.
I keep forgetting poor Mr. Trapscott.
How do you do?
You seem familiar with Army regulations.
What happens to a private who goes AWOL?
- Well, it depends. Why?
- I'm afraid Robert's in quite a jam.
He's in his apartment in town, and Col. Shiller is due in half an hour.
- Why don't you phone?
- I have. He doesn't answer.
If anything happens to that boy,
I'll never forgive myself.
I'll go get him. My car's right outside.
- It won't be too much trouble?
- Not at all.
There's something
I want to talk over with him.
You've taken the load off my mind.
- See you later.
- Bye, dear.
- Will you pardon me, please?
- All right.
Martin, aren't you ashamed?
Martin, aren't you ashamed?
Can you forget those gophers long enough to do me a favour?
Sure. What's up?
Listen, I've got to go AWOL long enough to get a wedding license.
I've got to convince her I'm on the level when I propose.
- Miss Winthrop?
- Yeah.
I want you to keep those guards so busy they won't miss me for an hour or so.
By the time you change your clothes, we'll have everything under control.
Okay, fellas. So long, fellas.
Hi, soldier.
Hey, fellas, did a hat go by here?
Hey, Kewpie! Kewpie!
Where are you? Kewpie!
I got him.
Kewpie! Here it is.
Boy, are we lucky! If he'd got away, goodbye, Camp Weston.
- What's going on?
- We got a spy under there.
- A what?
- It's a foreign pigeon from Europe.
- What'll you do?
- We gotta get the major.
Keep your eyes on it.
Don't let it get away!
Wait a minute.
How can a pigeon be a spy?
They train them.
They import a trainer from the Army.
It's got a camera tied to its leg.
We caught it taking pictures of the camp.
- Well, I'm a son of a gun.
- Hey! Don't do that.
If that bird ever... You'd both be shot.
Don't let that pigeon get away from you, soldier. Come on, Swivel.
- What's going on here?
- Something's under the hat.
- What is it, boys?
- It's a spy.
- In the hat.
- In whose hat? Are you crazy?
It's a pigeon spy. European.
It's a spy, all right.
He's got a camera strapped to his leg.
Whoever heard of a pigeon that could operate a camera?
The son of a gun bit me!
Oh, Mr. Curtis. You frightened me!
What do you think you did to me?
What are you doing here?
This happens to be my apartment.
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
Mr. Cortland told me I could use it.
Well, now, that's mighty chummy all around, isn't it?
My, this is terrible!
What would people think?
Take it easy, my innocent little friend.
I'll be out of here in one minute.
Tell Mr. Cortland the next time he passes out apartments that don't belong to him...
The bloodhounds.
Robert, are you there?
Why, Sheila!
Lmagine you standing there.
Why, yes, it's Sheila.
You might let me in.
I'm not selling anything.
Sure, sure. Come in.
- Well, Sheila, how are you?
- I'm fine, but you're in trouble.
- What trouble did you hear about?
- You're AWOL. They're looking for you.
As trouble goes, that's nothing.
If you go back to the guardhouse, that's a lot of trouble to me.
Sheila, that's sweet.
Come on, I'll drive you back in my car.
That must be the boys.
Better let me handle this.
Hello, Miss Winthrop.
Is Pvt. Curtis in there?
I thought he was in the Army.
He'll be in the Army plenty when we nab him.
Well, there's no hurry.
We'll wait around a while.
- Is there a back way out?
- Back way?
This is a second floor apartment.
Oh, wait!
There's a fire escape outside the bedroom window.
- Hold it! We can't go in there.
- Why not?
Well, you see, that's my bedroom.
Don't be coy.
Well, I mean, there's work going on in there.
There's a plumber.
- What difference does that make?
- What difference?
- There you are.
- He's just fixing the shower. Come on.
Charming, wasn't it?
- You mean, that little...
- That dainty little garment. Yes.
What the well-dressed plumber is wearing, I guess.
It takes all kinds of plumbers to make a world.
It was simply adorable.
I'd love to know where he bought it.
No, I wouldn't do that. You don't know how some people feel about those things.
Plumber?
His voice is changing.
Sonya, come out of there.
Tell Miss Winthrop exactly what happened.
- Shall I tell her everything?
- Yes. What do you mean, everything?
- Don't you believe it, Sheila.
- I don't.
Sonya is trying too hard.
- Sheila, you're wonderful.
- I'm surprised, Sonya.
- This is the oldest game in the world.
- You think so?
If I were you,
I'd stick to plumbing exclusively.
A plumber? Aren't you silly?
Why didn't you tell me the truth?
How did I know you were one girl in 50 million?
Let this be a lesson to you.
Let's get down this fire escape.
By the way, what did you come to your apartment for?
- It was a surprise, Sheila.
- For whom?
- You.
- Tell me.
- No, I'd rather wait until after the show.
- Now that I know...
No. I'll tell you later.
Come on. Let's go.
That's it, isn't it?
I'm gonna feel awful about this.
You shouldn't have done that.
No.
Especially since it's for "dear, sweet Sonya."
What is?
I can see why you wanted to save the surprise.
- Holy smoke! Something's happened here.
- So it seems.
- But I bought this bracelet from Martin...
- Certainly.
And after he sold it, he went to all that trouble, just for the fun of it.
You know Martin's apt to do anything.
"One woman in 50 million" can certainly be simple-minded at times.
There's a perfect explanation.
Write it to me. A letter will reach me in Panama in about a week.
What's Panama got to do with this?
I'll be there with Capt. Barton.
We're leaving in a few days, right after the marriage.
- You've got this all wrong.
- The guards.
Would you please get me
Mrs. Martin Cortland, Adirondack 5636.
Thank you. I'll hold on.
- See you at rehearsal.
- Sure thing, baby. You said it.
Now, that's sensible.
Martin will be very happy.
Oh, he'll be tickled pink.
Everybody will be happy.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Hello? Hello? Julia?
This is Robert.
Yeah. Julia, Martin and I are putting on a show at camp.
Well, hello, boys.
I've been looking for you. Sit down.
Julia, what I called to say is, it looks like very stormy weather up here.
Do tell.
It's a tornado, honey. A hurricane.
In fact, the blow is so hard, it lifts you right off your feet.
Goodbye. I have to go now.
To the guardhouse, boys.
Sonya's gonna be very good in this show.
- I don't think we'll miss Sheila at all.
- I don't think so.
Is she really going off to Panama with that Barton fella?
So I've heard.
Too bad. It's your own fault.
You will play around.
I'm just a dirty dog.
Live and learn, I always say.
Live and learn.
Robert, do me a favour, will you?
Look back and tell me, is that Julia?
I wouldn't be surprised.
Did you have anything to do with this, you despicable, sordid...?
- Julia, why, this is a delightful surprise!
- Hello, Martin dear.
- Hello, Robert.
- Hello, Julia.
You'd think you'd telegraph and warn a person.
Not that I'm not tickled to death to see you.
- You look delirious.
- He's missed you terribly, Julia.
He's been pining his heart away. He rushed into town to buy you something.
A lovely little trinket, right there in his pocket.
Something to scratch with, no doubt.
Well...
"For my dear, sweet Sonya."
Listen, Julia, there's been a hideous mistake.
Oh, Sonya, would you come here a moment, please?
- I can explain everything.
- Better make it a good one.
It's Robert. I'm using his apartment and last night, he said:
"Martin, bring me the bracelet
I bought for Sonya."
Look at it. It's the same one he bought for Sheila.
He broke Sheila's heart playing around with Sonya, and she gave it back.
And then the cad had the name changed on the very same bracelet.
Boy, that was a pip.
Take back your filthy bauble, sir.
And in the future, do not make me a party to your low intrigues.
- Yes, Mr. Curtis.
- This little present is for you, Sonya.
Oh, how wonderful!
"For my dear, sweet Sonya."
- Oh, Martin! I love you, darling!
- Stop it! Stop it!
- What is the meaning of this?
- Sonya, this is Mrs. Cortland.
- Mrs. Cortland?
- Yes, my wife.
The woman I treasure.
Sonya, didn't you say something about having possibly to leave the show?
Why, yes. There's my sick uncle and my sick cousin and...
- And something might happen to you too.
- Yes.
Well, I'm happy to have met you,
Mrs. Cortland.
There goes your gal.
Boys, back to the guardhouse.
Let's go.
What do you mean?
What about the show?
Show? Without a leading lady?
Ready, boys?
Wait! There's Sheila. Get her back.
She's going to Panama. However...
...if you tried explaining what happened in my apartment with "dear, sweet Sonya"...
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- That's what I thought.
Boys, it's my right to serve my sentence.
Take me back to the guardhouse.
- Okay, soldier, let's go.
- Robert, my...
Now, Martin, my pet...
...l'm going to get to the bottom of this Sonya matter if it's the last...
Julia, I'm as innocent as a newborn babe, or a little older, perhaps.
Hey, Kewpie, Swivel Tongue, where do you think I'm going?
- Again?
- What happened?
- Oh, nothing. Show's off, that's all.
- Off? How come?
Miss Winthrop decided to go to Panama instead.
Now, I ask you, disappointing all those poor soldiers...
...is that fair of Miss Winthrop?
- It's a crime.
That's what I think. Understand?
Do you understand?
Well, what are we waiting on?
So you see, she walks right out on the show.
Yeah. They promised us a big shindig, and it's off!
- How do you like that?
- How did she get that way?
These two fellas tell me there's no show.
What are we, soldiers or mice?
- This Winthrop gal picks up and walks.
- What's the idea? She can't do that.
I'm sorry, but if Uncle Sam were to walk in here and ask me...
...to go back into that show, I'd...
We're all packed and ready to leave on our honeymoon, sir.
What's so important about a honeymoon?
When you've been married 25 years, as I have, you'll look back and wonder...
But never mind that.
One more word from you, and I'll be forced to have you disciplined.
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
Now, here's a problem for that charming
Captain Curtis to handle.
I have a funny hunch he's working on it.
- Miss Winthrop...
- You're wasting time, colonel.
You hear that? The whole blooming Army is calling for you.
And I might say, that includes myself.
- Sheila's changed her mind.
- The show's on!
- Well, what a pleasant surprise.
- Come on, let's get going.
Yes, sir, just one second.
I got a little business about the show.
I put a big military wedding number in this show for a purpose.
With Sheila and I as bride and groom, see?
What I had in mind was...
...suppose you fellas got a real justice of the peace to play that part?
That would save Miss Winthrop that little trip to Panama.
See what I mean?
- Yeah.
- Sure.
All right. Get to work, and no slip-ups.
See you in the auditorium.
All right, kids. Let's go.
- Yes?
- It's going fine, don't you think?
One more number and it's over, and that'll be even finer.
You're going to be the loveliest bride anybody ever saw.
If you recall, the Army said,
"Just dance with him.
You don't have to talk to him."
Oh, here comes the bride, no less
It's hot stuff, that fluffy dress
I must admit, though she's lit
She looks a bit sweet
No wonder her Romeo
Begins shouting hi-de- ho
As his bride starts to stride
To a boogie beat
There's a big increase in marriages
Due to a tune, they say
The wedding cak e walk
Is the roundelay
When newlyweds in fancy carriages
Leave the reception gay
The wedding cak e walk
Sends them on their way
Pasty choirs in tasty churches
Give it all they got
Prudish old preachers on their perches
Say, "Amen, it's hot"
All those bridal suites at Claridge's
Have radios that play
The wedding cak e walk
Night and day
If any person can show cause why they may not lawfully be joined together...
...let him now speak, or forever hold his peace.
Do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife?
I do.
Do you take this man to be your lawful wedded husband?
I do.
In accordance with the authority vested in me, I now pronounce you man and wife.
Will you stop, the show is over.
The real show has just started,
Mrs. Curtis.
Mrs. What?
Ladies and gentlemen... Just in time,
Capt. Barton and my dear friend, Martin.
Listen, everybody,
Sheila and I are man and wife.
Yes, the man who performed the wedding ceremony was a real justice of the peace.
You are, without a doubt, the...
Let go of me.
I believe Curtis was to be returned to the guardhouse right after the show.
Come on, Curtis.
I'll have this annulled, then have him arrested.
Think it over, darling.
A husband in jail is no use at all.
- You and your show!
- Listen, now that you're married...
...I can't let Robert be tortured like this...
...so I've got to tell you,
I changed the name on the bracelet.
I framed the thing up in his apartment, so that I could get Sonya into the show.
I'd have told you this before, but that old G-woman of mine...
Oh, you darling!
I wonder if they have daylight saving around here?
Hurry up, Swivel.
Curtis has to have a honeymoon.
He should've started digging from the guardhouse.
Oh, shut up and dig.
Mrs. Curtis calling on her husband.
The last I heard, the Curtises don't live here anymore.
They broke up, I heard.
I heard she might be coming back to him.
You did?
But it's rather awkward with the bridegroom behind bars.
Awkward? It's awful.
I could pitch a tent out here, and we could look at each other.
Curtis.
On recommendation of Captain Barton,
I'm releasing you for your honeymoon.
Colonel, you're a sweetheart.
Oh, sorry, sir. Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you.
Curtis? Curtis?
I guess we're lost.
It's pretty foggy tonight.
Yes. You see, we had a date with... we're going to China...

It's 9:30 already. The day's gone and we haven't seen a thing.
I got the rest of the day figured out.
9:45, the New York City Hall.
Hey, fellas!
Hey, fellas! Aren't we gonna do any more sightseeing?
I never been any place but Peoria.
I wanna take in the beauties of New York.
And I wanna take 'em out.
Back where I come from all the dames are covered with coal dust.
Wow! Get a load of that!
- Not bad.
- Not bad! Get him! "Mr. Particular!"
Who you got waitin' for you?
Ava Gardner?
Listen! I'm gonna take my time till I find me a real New York glamour girl.
I got a line that mows 'em down.
Home in Meadowville, it lands me the cream of the crop.
Meadowville? You may be a big shot in Meadowville... but don't forget the whole town could fit in that manhole over there.
Yeah? And so could you!
- Yeah?
- Yeah!
Hey, fellas! Break it up.
We're wasting the whole day.
Why can't we pick up dates and sightsee at the same time?
See? Look, 10:30, the Aquarium.
Then 10:45...
Sure, why not?
Ozzie, I got the whole day figured out.
"Oh, hello!"
Hold hands.
"Shall we dance?"
Our first kiss.
Wow! Wow!
Come on. Let's get the subway.
Pardon me, sir, but how do I get uptown?
Well, let's see. If you wanna go to...
And there you are.
I beg your pardon.
Is this the uptown platform?
Now, it all depends.
Get that?
Yeah, thanks.
Come on.
Then what'd he say?
So I said, "Listen, Mr. Gadolphin,
I won't work overtime, no matter what...
"...whether it's handling the bookkeeping accounts or you."
What'd he say?
So I said, "Listen, Mr. Gadolphin, you make just one more pass at me...
"...and yours truly is passing right out from the Grand Illusion Girdle Company."
- And what did he say?
- So I said...
Hey! One side, fellows.
- Say, what're you doin'?
- Puttin' up a little artwork.
There. Miss Turnstiles for the month of June.
"Meet lovely Ivy Smith."
- Gee, a real New York glamour girl.
- A debutante, I'll bet.
- She must be pretty important.
- I wouldn't say that.
Her picture's up all over the subway.
Well, like it says, they pick a new Miss Turnstiles every month.
Excuse me.
Look, "She's a home-loving girl...
"...but she loves high society's whirl."
"She loves the Army, but her heart belongs to the Navy."
"She is studying painting at the museums and dancing at Symphonic Hall."
Gee, she's wonderful!
A celebrity.
Yeah, what a girl!
She can do everything.
Look what it says:
"Meet lovely Ivy Smith.
"Every month some lucky little
New York miss is chosen...
"...from the thousands of girls who ride the subways...
"...to be Miss Turnstiles.
"She's got to be brilliant, beautiful, talented.
"Just an average girl.
"This month, the fortunate lassie is
Miss Ivy Smith."
Who? Me?
Yes, you.
Though a celebrity,
Miss Smith is a home-loving girl.
But she loves high society's whirl.
She goes out for the Army...
but her heart belongs to the Navy.
She studies painting and dancing at Symphonic Hall.
She's a frail, flower-like creature.
But oh, boy! What an athlete!
Gee, what a girl!
- Hey, cut that out.
- Gabe!
Come on. Let's get out of here.
Hey, put that back, you guys.
Why'd you do that?
I like her. I want it for my collection.
That's all you'll have of her.
Who knows? Maybe I'll meet her.
There are over four million women in New York City.
It'll take you a million years to find her.
Why, the law of averages says...
Miss Smith, act like you're putting a coin in a box.
Out of the way.
We're takin' a picture here.
Why don't we get one of these sailors in the picture? Stand here.
Miss Smith, give him the dime.
You put the fare in the box for her.
Hey, you're...
Aren't you Miss Turnstiles?
- How did you know?
- I saw your picture in the subway and...
- You mean you saw my picture at...
- Yeah.
Oh, that.
I'm terribly flattered you liked it well enough to take it with you.
- How's that, Max?
- Fine.
Drop the dime in the box, Sailor.
Hold it.
That's all, Miss Smith. Thanks, Sailor.
We're proud of our boys.
Thanks. I'm terribly late now.
I'll have to run.
Goodbye, Sailor.
Thanks for posing with me.
Hey, wait!
- We'll head her off at the next station.
- What?
In a cab.
Why do you always have to run after girls?
I'll tell you when your voice changes,
Junior.
Hey, Oz, come on.
Taxi. Taxi.
Sorry. No more fares today.
I'm turning in the cab. It's overdue.
Please, mister.
Hey! He's a girl!
What're you doing driving a cab?
The war's over.
I never give up anything I like. Get in.
- The subway station.
- It's right there. You too weak to walk it?
No, the next one, uptown.
All right, but only if he gets up front.
All right, Chip. Get up there.
- Get in there.
- No.
Come on. Get going.
- What's wrong with you?
- What's got into you?
I met her. I ran right into her. You said it couldn't happen and I ran into her.
What became of the line of jive that "mows 'em down"?
I didn't have a chance. Just watch me when we catch up with her.
Lady, faster, please.
Yeah, come on, lady.
For you, anything. What's your name?
Chip.
Chip, huh? Bet you can't guess mine.
There are over two million girl's names registered...
All right, you win. It's Esterhazy.
Brunhilde Esterhazy.
Pleased to meet you.
- Why don't you come up to my place?
- What?
Look, Chip, I've been waitin' for you all my life.
I knew you the minute I saw you.
You're for me.
I like your face, it's open, you know what I mean? Nothin' in it.
The kind of a face I could fall into.
- Kiss me.
- Please, Miss Esterhazy.
Just call me Hildy. Why don't you ditch these guys and come up to my place?
Lady, I hardly know you.
I've only got one day in town.
- I want to see all the famous landmarks.
- Stick with me, kid, I'll show you plenty.
Hey, here it is.
Oh, yeah, Columbus Circle.
- Hey, Esterhazy, what're you doin' here?
- Hello, Spud. What's on your tiny mind?
Don't sweet-talk me.
This cab is due back in the garage.
Bixby's waitin' to take it out.
Get in there or I'll report you.
Okay. Okay.
We must have just missed the train.
Taxi. Taxi. Taxi.
I'll bet we'll find dozens of glamour girls at Grant's Tomb.
- Sure.
- Taxi, anyone?
You don't wanna waste your whole day lookin' for one girl.
Taxi. Taxi.
And besides, Gabe, you always got the picture.
When we get aboard ship, you can hang it up in a locker.
The picture! Look, fellows, it's full of clues.
- If I follow them, I'm sure to find her.
- What?
She has to be at one of these places.
We can track her down easy.
Gabe, what's happened to you?
I don't know. All I know is
I gotta find this girl.
Get your red hot taxis here.
Wait a minute, fellows.
I don't want to spoil your day.
- You guys go ahead.
- What's it say on the card?
If we do this systematically, we can find her in a couple of hours.
It says she's studying painting in the museums...
Museums?
Come on. Let's try it.
Well?
Here I am.
- Where's the nearest museum?
- Museum of Anthropological History.
Okay, let's go.
Only if he gets up front.
What's the big idea?
I knew you'd come back.
They all come back.
How much do we owe you?
Never mind. Let's run it up a little.
I'm coming in with you.
This unique skeleton is the result of 20 years unceasing labor.
This dinosaur roamed the earth six million years ago.
Let us move on.
Excuse me.
Don't be frightened, lady.
They're all dead.
Hold it. It's fantastic. I've simply got to get the two of you together.
Oh, my dear, you are priceless.
Thank you. How about some cheesecake?
What a lucky girl I am.
I've got to get your measurements.
I'm a Junior Miss, size 11, very high-waisted.
Gorgeous.
Now, it's my turn.
Stop! How dare you!
I was only playin', lady.
What are you doin' tonight?
Now, just a minute. I want you to know that my interest in you is purely scientific.
I'm just a cold-blooded scientist... and I'm writing an anthropological study for this museum.
It's called Modern Man - What Is It?
- The name is Claire Huddesen.
- Pleased to meet you.
I took your picture just now because you look exactly...
like this Pithecanthropus erectus, a man extinct since 6,000,000 B.C.
I look like that?
I look like that.
Now, don't be moody.
You made an understandable mistake.
And now the head.
That subsuperdolichocephalic head!
Sailor, I love you for having that.
All my life I wanted someone to love me for my sakidophalic head.
Don't be bitter.
There aren't many of us left. We had a sakidophalic class reunion last year.
Not many of the old faces around anymore.
Well, that'll be all. You can go now.
How come a girl like you is interested in this anthropo... whatchamacallit?
You see, it's this way.
I've been running around too much with all kinds of young men.
I just couldn't settle down... so my guardian suggested
I take up anthropology.
He thought if I made a scientific study of man, I'd become more objective... get them out of my system, be able to control myself.
- Has it worked?
- Almost completely.
I was just asking if she knew where I could find Miss Turnstiles.
- Sure.
- Of course.
And I was just doing a bit of research.
Dr. Kinsey, I presume.
Really, I was just telling your friend...
Ozzie.
Ozzie, what a remarkable specimen he is.
An exact throwback to the Pithecanthropus erectus.
Hey, look. She's gonna put me in a book.
- Holy smoke!
- How about that?
Yes, you see, there are all too few modern males... who can measure up to the prehistoric.
"Modern man is not for me
"The movie star and Dapper Dan
"Give me the healthy Joe from ages ago
"A prehistoric man
"What has Gable got for me
"Or Mrs. Johnson's blond boy, Van
"I want a happy ape with no English drape
"A prehistoric man
"Top hats, bow ties
"He simply wore no ties
"Bearskin, bearskin
"He just sat around in nothin' but bearskin
"I really love bearskin
"Some guys care a lot for me
"But my excitement they can't fan
"Because I still await my primitive mate
"We've had a date
Since the world began
"My prehistoric man
"No psychoanalysis
"He never knew what made him tick
"He never paid, it seems, for telling his dreams
"Poor prehistoric Dick
"Jitters, jitters
"He never had jitters
"No repression
"He just believed in free self-expression
"I love self-expression
"He had honest calluses
"He never worked to pile up dough
"So unlike you and me
No ulcers had he
"Simple and free in the long ago
"Poor prehistoric Joe
"Bebop, bebop
"They didn't have bebop
"Tom-toms, tom-toms
"They sat all the day just a beatin' on tom-toms
"I really love tom-toms"
Tom-tom!
That's good!
Watch out!
We'd better get out of here. Come on.
Come on.
Come on, let's go!
- Calling car 44.
- That's us.
Report to Museum of
Anthropological History.
Investigate collapse of dinosaur.
- Collapse? Why, that's terrible.
- Why?
She's my favorite singing star, that Dinah Shore.
The professor at the museum seemed miffed.
How'd you feel if someone broke your dinosaur?
I never had one, we were too poor.
Well, can I drop the three of you someplace?
No. We're all helping Gabey find Miss Turnstiles.
Let's try all the other museums.
We're stickin' with you, Gabe.
We don't give up that easy.
Well, neither do I.
Toujours l'amour.
At least I'm catching up on my culture.
Where do we go from here?
She might be at the Symphonic Hall Building.
- Symphonic Hall?
- Yeah.
Wait a second.
I want to get something straight.
You're all going to the Symphonic Hall?
Yeah.
If she isn't there, you'll go someplace else?
Sure.
- And then someplace else?
- Yeah.
And you guys have to be back on the ship at 6:00 tomorrow morning?
Well, it seems to me if we split up, we'd get farther.
I mean, we'd get farther looking for her.
We'd keep looking but we'd look... in three different places instead of the same place.
Yeah. Maybe Hildy and I could go to the subway people for some information.
That's a splendid idea. Ozzie and I, we could look Miss Smith up... in the social register.
I have a copy at home.
Yeah. Yeah. That sounds practical.
Yeah. Very practical.
- We hate to leave you alone.
- I know you do. It's breakin' your heart.
- Shall we go?
- Come along, specimen.
- Well, we'll all meet at 8:30, huh?
- Okay. Where?
On top of the Empire State Building?
All right. 8:30.
We'll see what we can get done till then.
Well, so long.
Good hunting.
Which way do we go?
The way of all flesh, Junior.
The way of all flesh.
- I guess we pulled that off.
- Yeah. I'm glad we're alone.
Well, I'm glad you're glad.
It's about time.
Where'll we go first?
Now that we're alone, you can take me on that sightseeing tour of the city.
I was afraid you'd remember that.
A quick tour of the city, then up to my place.
No. Then we gotta go looking for Gabey's girl.
No! Then up to my place.
Where do you want to go first?
"My grandpa told me, 'Chip, my boy
"'There'll come a time when you'll leave home
"'lf you should ever hit New York
Be sure to see the Hippodrome"'
- The Hippodrome?
- Yeah, the Hippodrome.
"Did I hear right?
Did you say the Hippodrome?
"Yes, you heard right.
Yes, I said the...
"Hey, what did you stop for?
"It ain't there anymore
"They tore it down, you know, a dozen years ago"
I wanted to see the Hippodrome.
What year is that guidebook anyway?
1905! No wonder!
Don't you realize a big city like this changes all the time?
But there's one thing that doesn't change.
Come up to my place.
No.
"My grandpa saw the girlie shows and told me of one special pearl
"He said the hottest show in town
Was called The Florodora Girl"
- Florodora Girl?
- Yeah, The Florodora Girl.
"Did I dig that?
Was that Florodora Girl?
"Yes, you dug that
That was Florodora...
"What stop for did you, hey?
"You may not see that play
"That famous girlie show closed 40 years ago
"Come up to my place
"No
"My grandpa said I'd see New York
In all its beauty and its power
"From the city's highest spot
Atop the famous Woolworth Tower"
- The Woolworth Tower?
- Yeah, the Woolworth Tower.
"Hold the phone, Joe
Did you say the Woolworth Tower?
"I'm still ringing
Yes, I said the...
"Did you stop for, hey what?
"That ain't the highest spot
"Since that old guidebook date
They built the Empire State
- "Come up to my place
- Let's go to Cleopatra's Needle
"Let's go to my place
- "Let's see Wanamaker's Store
- Let's go to my place
- "Let's go to Lindy's, go to Luchow's
- Go to my place
- "Let's see Radio City and Herald Square
- Let's go to my place
- "Go to Reuben's
- Go to my place
- "Go to Macy's, go to Roxy's
- Go to my place
- "Cloisters, Gimbels'
- My place
- "Flat Iron Building
- My place
"Hippodrome
"My place"
Well, this is it. My little palace.
Gee, it's real homey. A swell view, too.
Yeah, on a clear day, you can see the backyard.
Come on. Put your bundles down.
Make yourself at home.
You know, Hildy, I feel that we ought to really try to find Miss Turnstiles.
Look, Chip, we tried before.
- Yeah, we did try.
- Sure.
- And we'll try again later.
- Sure, much later. Let's try this first.
Well, as long as we tried...
Lucy!
What on earth are you doing here?
I'm sorry, Hildy. I just couldn't go to work today.
I've got an awful cold and I didn't know you...
Of all the days you picked.
Chip, this is my roommate, Lucy Shmeeler.
She's a grand girl.
- How do you do?
- Hello, Chip.
I'm sorry. I've got to inhale.
Excuse me.
- Think she'll stay under there long?
- Sure. She'll be under there for days.
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
You know, Hildy, this is just like taking a picture.
If I had a camera, I could get the two of you together.
You could do that by just leaving the room.
Come here.
- Is that you, Chip?
- No.
I've got to get some gargle.
I got the gargle.
Well, I'm very glad to hear that.
Lucy!
Would you mind stepping into the other room?
- What for?
- I'd like to go over some figures with you.
- Figures?
- The rent, Lucy. The rent.
Hildy, we paid...
I'm going out.
With that cold?
I'm going to an air-cooled movie.
Hildy says...
- It'll do you a world of good, Lucy.
- Yes, it will. Yes.
Thanks. I'll do the same for you someday.
When will you ever get the opportunity?
- Goodbye, Miss Shmeeler.
- Goodbye, Mr. Chips.
"Hark! Ah, the nightingale.
The tawny..."
But I don't wanna be like Margaret O'Brien.
Now, be quiet.
Just wait till I get you home.
- Are you auditioning for Grab Your Spats?
- No, I'm only interested in classic ballet.
Plié!
But, Madame, my parents in Meadowville are so proud of me.
They're so thrilled that I'm Miss Turnstiles.
Second position.
I know that being Miss Turnstiles means nothing... but they think it makes me an important person.
Gee, it'd be just terrible if they found out
I'm working as a kootch dancer.
Third position. Me, I will not breathe a word on them about this... unless I must write them about payments.
- Madame Dilyovska.
- Fourth position.
Remember, you're a fortunate girl.
You study with great Dilyovska who has taught everyone... from Nijinsky to Mickey Rooney.
Fifth position.
I will make you big star.
I am best teacher this side of the world.
And now, my special exercise for the balance:
The upside-down frappé.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Good. Good.
Very good.
Pardon me, my dear.
I will be gone only short while.
Keep practicing.
Practicing.
Yes, Madame.
Clumsy mariner, look where you're going.
Hey!
- A gentleman should always knock.
- It's you, Ivy Smith.
And what if I am?
I knew I'd find you!
Don't you remember me?
I'm afraid we haven't had the pleasure.
I'm the sailor who posed with you in the subway.
Oh, of course.
I dimly recall, one meets so many people.
Yeah. Yeah, I bet you do.
Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm busy.
Listen, Ivy, you know, it was funny, me bumping into you like this.
I just happened to be passing
Symphonic Hall, and I said to myself:
"Gabe, my boy," that's my name, Gabey...
"...why don't you drop in, have a look-see at the girls?"
I had an hour to kill, so I thought
I'd give some lucky little chick a break.
If you play your cards right, it could be you.
What are you driving at?
I'm a pretty special guy and you're a pretty special girl... so why don't you and me do some fancy steppin' tonight?
Take in the swank spots. You know,
El Morocco, Stork Club, Roseland...
How about it?
Of all the uncouth nerve.
- Leave at once, you sailor...
- Miss Smith, don't get excited...
Of all the insulting lines. Do you think
I'd go out with any old sailor...
I've never even seen before?
Please, leave at once! I'm very busy!
I have a singing lesson upstairs, and I've got to change.
Okay, sister, it's your loss.
Look, I want to apologize for everything I just said.
I thought I'd pull that fancy line on you but it didn't work.
I didn't just drop in here accidentally.
I've been looking for you all day, ever since I met you.
Really?
Yeah. And then finding you like this,
I guess I lost my head.
I threw that big-shot stuff at you... because I thought it was the only way
I could impress a big celebrity like you.
You probably got millionaires, society guys running after you all the time.
Oh, yes.
By the droves.
Yeah. Well, I'm sorry I bothered you.
I guess I'm a little out of my depth.
Us small-town guys must sound silly to a native New Yorker like you.
Oh, yes.
When one is a native New Yorker... small town seem so provincial.
Back home in Meadowville, Indiana, we don't get to meet girls like you.
Meadowville?
- Yeah, did you ever hear of it?
- Oh, no.
I probably learned about it in geography.
I doubt that, the population's only 18,000.
That's not so small.
- They're all people, just like anyone else.
- That's right.
I think a small town's all right.
It's nobody's fault if they're from there.
They're usually born there.
We big-city folk must never forget that "the small towns...
"...are the backbones of the American civilization."
That's just the phrase Miss Hodges used in my American history class.
Did you have Miss Hodges?
I mean, Miss Hodges is such a funny name.
Yeah.
Well, tell me more about this place,
Meadowville.
- You really want to hear about it?
- Yes.
"There's not much to tell about my hometown
"Life is easy and the tempo slow
"But if you really want to find what's in it
"You'll learn in a minute
"All you have to know
"Let's go
"Come walkin' with me
"I want you to see our Main Street
"You'll know the whole town
"By just walkin down our Main Street
"There's the corner where the boys hang out
"As each girl goes by they rate her
"Whistle and try to date her, later
"Baby, are you goin' steady?
"And then we can stop and chat with the cop
"On Main Street
"He made an arrest way back in 1903
"He'll ask me,
'Who is the pretty stranger? '
"How proud I'm gonna be
"When you walk down Main Street with me
"How proud I'm gonna be
"When you walk down Main Street...
"...with me"
Gosh, Ivy...
I mean, Miss Smith...
Do you think that...
Would you go out with me tonight?
Oh, no. I'm afraid a date is quite out of the question. I'm busy.
One of your rich boyfriends?
Yes, one of them, or other.
But how long are you going to be in town?
Just today. I gotta be back on the ship tomorrow morning.
Gabey, I'd love to go out with you tonight.
What?
I have a big society party to go to but I'll break the engagement.
- You will?
- Yes.
- Shall I come and get you?
- Oh, no. I'll meet you.
- Good. 8:30?
What is here going on?
- Is this a friend of yours?
- Well, not exactly...
Leave at once, young man.
Well, goodbye. About 8:30.
On your way, bell-bottom.
Madame Dilyovska, I'm going out with him tonight.
Where?
We forgot to say where!
Top of the Empire State Building.
But it's so high up.
It won't seem high to me.
I'm in the clouds right now.
You will not keep that date. You will be at your job at Coney Island tonight.
But Madame Dilyovska, just this once...
"Meadowville, Indiana.
Dear Mr. And Mrs. Smith:"
- What are you doing?
- I am composing letter to your parents.
I will be at Coney Island tonight at 12:00... and if you are not there at that time
I shall regretfully have to mail it.
Madame Dilyovska, you wouldn't do that!
Why not?
But I have to meet him.
I'll leave him at 11:30.
You would better leave him at 11:30 or...
Look, there's Grant's Tomb.
I can see it just like in the pictures.
Let me see.
It says it was built in 1897 and more than 15 million people have seen it.
How do you like that?
Hey, this thing's quit.
Have you got another dime?
What do you want a dime for?
You can see me for nothing.
I got one.
Look, there's Symphonic Hall.
And it's so close, too.
You know, Hildy,
I feel kind of guilty about Gabey.
He's my pal and he looks after me.
I mean, maybe we should have looked for Ivy Smith.
Here we go again. I tell you, we never could have found her.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
There's the George Washington Bridge.
And the Music Hall.
Why didn't I come up here sooner?
I wasted my whole day away.
Thanks a lot.
Hildy, I didn't mean that. I'm sorry.
Get back to your telescope.
You two make a lovely couple.
I don't want to look through the telescope.
I'd rather look at you.
Whisper sweet nothings in my ear... like the population of the Bronx or how many hot dogs were sold... last year at Yankee Stadium.
Please, Hildy, don't be mad. I like you.
I think you're very pretty.
You're the prettiest cab driver
I've ever seen.
Tell it to your guidebook.
It means more to you than I do.
There.
Chip, you care.
Why didn't you tell me?
Gee, I don't know.
"I'd like to whisper sweet nothings
"Those words that everyone knows
"But my thoughts get mangled
"And all the words get tangled
"But since you ask me, here goes
"You're awful
"Awful good to look at
"Awful nice to be with
"Awful sweet to have and hold
"You're nothin'
"Nothin' if not lovely
"Nothin' if not dazzling
"Nothin' but pure gold
"You're frightening
"Frightening me when you say
That you might go away
"You're boring
"Boring into my heart to stay
"You're cheap, dear
"Cheap at any price, dear
"Cheap for such a diamond
"Cheap for such a pearl
"What I said before I'll say again
"You're awful
"Awful nice to be my girl
"You're old, dear
"Old with worldly wisdom
"Old like Gorgonzola
"Old like vintage French champagne
"You're so-so
"So, so kind of charming
"So, so kind of witty
"So I can't explain
"Can't stand you
"I can't stand you to give some fellow the eye
"Can't see you
"In the arms of another guy
"Who needs you
"Needs you to distraction
"Needs you till he's crazy
"Needs you rain or shine
"I'm the one who needs you
"And I think you're awful
"Awful nice to say you're mine"
Chip!
Hey, Oz! How are you?
Wow! What a view!
Glad I didn't join the Air Force.
Did you find Miss Turnstiles?
Not exactly. But I looked.
Yeah, I looked, too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, tough luck not finding her.
This must be the place.
- Gabey!
- Hiya!
- How are you?
- How you doin'?
You'd think they hadn't seen each other in years.
Hiya, Claire. Hiya, Hildy.
Gabe, I tried to find her.
We looked all over. But let's face it, the town's too big.
Sure, sure. Say, what's the matter?
Did you get into a fight?
- How did that get there?
- You know, Gabe, I saw her, too.
- Yeah?
- Just for a flash.
- Where?
- In Yonkers.
A lot of photographers around her.
Just had a quick flash and then I lost her.
- The town's pretty big, Gabe.
- Too big, yeah.
Too big. Yeah.
Look, fellas, don't worry about me.
I'm all booked up for tonight.
Yeah? Nice girl?
Sure.
Ivy Smith.
- No! Miss Turnstiles?
- What're you trying to put over?
So help me, fellas, I found her.
She ought to be here any minute.
- Hey, look! Cops!
- Duck, everybody!
I'm sure he's up here, that sailor, looks like the statue of Pithecanthropus.
We'll take a look around the building.
- Hey, that's my boss!
- Here, try these for size.
- Do you recognize the other guy?
- The professor from the museum!
- He seems to be looking for someone.
- Guess who, specimen?
Hey, what am I gonna do?
- I've gotta hide. Where am I gonna hide?
- There's no hiding place up here.
Come on.
My dinosaur... ruined. He broke it.
Look. Sailors.
- Having fun, kids?
- Yeah. Swell view from up here.
Do you happen to know another sailor, a fellow who goes to museums?
Museums? Please. Sailors got other ways of studying natural history.
You haven't seen another sailor hanging around here, have you?
No. We haven't seen anyone hanging around here.
What's the matter with you?
The altitude. It makes me sleepy.
You say this sailor was at the Museum of Anthropological History today at 11:30?
Yes.
You're sure of his description?
I'll never forget him.
He has black hair, blue eyes... about five feet, eleven inches tall...
looks exactly like the statue of
Pithecanthropus erectus, exactly.
We're looking for three sailors and a lady cab driver.
A lady cab driver! Oh, how revolting!
Claire, did you ever...
You haven't seen 'em? Come along, Tracy.
I guess they're not up here.
Awe-inspirin', isn't it?
Majestic, that's what it is.
- It does a man's soul good to...
- Come on, Tracy.
What's the matter? Lose something?
- You poor darling! You brave thing!
- Why didn't you get rid of 'em sooner?
All these hours in the air!
I could get my wings for this.
- Or a striped suit. Let's go.
- No, I gotta wait for Ivy.
I don't believe you met her at all.
Where is she?
She had some big society affair to go to.
Maybe she had trouble breaking it.
Society affair? What does he think
Miss Turnstiles is?
He thinks she's a big celebrity.
Why tell him she's nobody?
It's his one day in town.
Oh, I get it.
I don't know what could have happened.
She promised me she'd be here.
Ivy!
Gabey! I'm sorry I'm late. But...
I thought you'd never get here.
I had a lot of trouble breaking my engagement, but I'm glad I did.
Me, too. Well, here she is,
Miss Turnstiles.
What do you know?
Ivy, this is Hildy, Claire, Ozzie, Chip.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're off on a lark.
I've got one suggestion before we embark.
There are lots of nice things to do in the dark... but let's not go rowing in Central Park.
"We're going on the town
"New York
"We're riding on a rocket
"We're gonna really sock it
"Because tonight's the night
"We're goin' on a toot
"We're goin' to raise a riot
"The Brooklyn Bridge, we'll buy it
"And hit the Heights tonight
"Get high as kites tonight
"East side, West side, round the city
"One day, one night, that's the pity
"But we won't look ahead
"Or let the light of dawn get us down
"We're really livin', Jack
"We're goin' on the town"
Stop, fellas!
"What're we sayin'? Look over there.
The fleet.
"Doesn't she look sweet?
"What did we leave it for?
"What are we doing on shore?
"We're simply crazy about the Navy
"How's that?
"We love it more than we can say
"How nice
"We get lots of good fresh air
"The ocean is everywhere
"That's why we hate to get leave and go away
"It's just so touching
Hear them say
"'Hate to get a leave and go away
Hate to leave the ship where life is play
"'All the livelong day'
"Just think what we could be doin' today
"We could be swabbing the decks
"Sweeping the bunks with a broom
"We could be shoveling tons of coal
"Down in the boiler room
"Got news
"We got those shore-leave blues
"It's just so touching
"Hear him sob
He wants a pretty little deck to swab
"Polish up the railings and the knobs
Poor unhappy gobs
"Oh, we got news, we got the shore-leave blues
"Especially me
"I miss the chow
"And that's not all, my friends
"Just think of this:
"Travel
"Adventure
"See the world
"The Navy. The Navy.
"Absolutely nothing does it lack
"And in the morning, tomorrow morning
"They'll have to come and drag us back
"On a spree
On a tear
"We're going north, south, east, west
Everywhere!
"We're goin' on the town
"We're kickin' back the traces
"We're gonna do the places
"We've never done before
"We're goin' on the loose
"We're blowin' all our dough in
"And we'll keep right on goin'
"As if no one before had any fun before
"Hot spots, swank spots, roofs and cellars
"Three smart girls
"And three slick fellers
"We're gonna paint it red
"We'll fill 'em up and then drink 'em down
"Let's have a ball tonight
"We're goin' on the town!"
- Looks a wee bit crowded.
- Leave it to me.
Waiter! Table for six, please.
Best you've got.
I'm sorry, sir. We are all filled up.
All filled up? I hear that's what they always say in New York.
You better start scraping and bowing now because the lady with me... happens to be none other than the famous Miss Turnstiles.
Gabey, please...
Miss Turnstiles? What are you talking about? No room.
Hey, you heard me. Miss Turnstiles for June. Ivy Smith.
What is this, Miss Turnstiles?
Go away, Sailor.
Hey, François!
Build us a table, will you?
I'm sorry, madame. There are no tables.
Of course, madame. A table, surely.
Garçon! Table.
See that girl over there? Make a big fuss over her. Miss Turnstiles.
- Miss Turnstiles? What is that?
- Never mind. Just make a fuss. Go ahead.
Miss Turnstiles! We are so proud and happy to have you here.
Please come in. Our humble establishment welcomes you with wide open doors.
There, you see! It worked like a charm.
It was nothing, really.
Gosh, this is a great table, huh?
Yeah.
Those girls are pretty.
Well, folks, what will it be?
Say, what's in this Explodo Bomborino?
Sounds good.
Four kinds of rum, brandy, grenadine, lime juice, papaya juice... and the white of one duck egg.
Only 12 to a customer.
How about this one,
Dreamland Nightmare?
Vodka, champagne, prune juice, floating chopped chives...
- He'll have a beer.
- Yeah, beer all around.
Pardon me, madame.
I'm so sorry. It was an accident.
I didn't really mean to sit on your lap.
I hope you all aren't hurt, but I was pushed and...
Scram!
Hey, look!
Look out! Here she comes again!
- Where are those drinks?
- Here you are, folks.
Just what I wanted.
A mug of solid glass.
"That's all there is, folks!
So, goodnight to you
"We hope you like our Sambacabana review!"
Come on, let's dance before the stampede starts.
All right, specimen. Let's go primitive.
Just a minute, Ozzie.
- Oh, François?
- Yes, madame?
Champagne, compliments of the house?
Yes, madame. With pleasure.
Compliments of the house.
Luckily we got leave when we hit here, otherwise...
Champagne for Miss Turnstiles.
Compliments of the house.
Thank you. Isn't that nice?
Gee, that's terrific.
Gosh, I guess this happens to you all the time, wherever you go.
Yes, on and off.
What shall we drink to?
Let's drink to New York.
New York.
It must be so exciting in the Navy.
You go all over the world from one big city to another, and... you see all kinds of strange places... and you meet all kinds of girls.
Yeah, well, when you only spend a short time in some place you... don't want to get too involved with any one particular girl.
I mean, you might never see her again.
Of course, it's best to just have a good time and not think about tomorrow.
Yeah, when we push off tomorrow,
I guess this'll all seem like a dream.
That's why I think it's silly to get too involved, because...
I know.
Getting involved, it's so... so involving.
Oh, Ivy.
Wait! Don't tell us.
You were just asking this young lady where you could find Miss Turnstiles.
- Look! Champagne.
- The guy just come over and said:
"Champagne for Miss Turnstiles.
Compliments of the house."
Real champagne?
Yeah, not cream soda, not celery tonic, but real champagne.
This is great.
I never had champagne before.
Ozzie, if you say the bubbles tickle your nose, I'll drown you.
- Let's have a toast.
- All right. This one's for the boys.
Here's to the girls we found in the great big city.
And this one's for the girls.
Here's to being found.
"That's all there is, folks
So goodnight to you
"We hope you liked our little
Dixieland Revue"
Come on, let's dance.
We'd just go out and get crushed to death.
What a way to die.
Ivy, I didn't mean what I said about not getting involved with a girl...
I may never see again.
No?
No. This isn't just one of those things where a sailor picks up a girl... for just one day. I have a feeling
I'm going to see you again.
I'm so glad you said that...
I know you're glamorous and famous, Ivy, and maybe you came along tonight...
- ...just to be nice to a guy on leave...
- That's not true, Gabey.
I came along tonight because I wanted to be with you... more than anything else in the world.
Honest?
Yes, Gabey.
Then I know we're gonna see each other again.
In the meantime, we have the whole night ahead of us.
- It's only 11:30 now and...
Yeah. What's the matter, Ivy?
Gabey, I don't know how to tell you this but...
Ivy, what is it?
Gabey, I've something to tell you.
Hey, Gabe, Gabey!
Hiya, Gabe.
Hey, Simpkins, Kovarski.
Say, there are two guys from my ship.
Ivy, I want them to meet you in person.
Wait here, I'll bring 'em right over.
- But Gabey...
- I'll only be a second.
Hiya, fellas.
How's the big town treatin' ya?
- Not bad, not bad. Daisy, Ella, Gabe.
- Hello, girls.
How's the Meadowville menace doin'?
I hit the jackpot today.
Nothin' much, just the most famous girl in New York City.
Who, the Statue of Liberty?
Twice as famous,
Miss Turnstiles for June.
- Yeah? Who's that?
- Who's that? Are you kiddin'?
Her picture's up all over the subway...
Where is she?
Over here. Come over to the table.
I'll introduce you.
- Excuse us, girls. We'll be right back.
- Excuse us.
The grass is always greener, if you know what I mean.
How'd you meet a dame like that?
Magnetism, boys, sheer magnetism.
She was drawn to me...
- She must have gone to powder her nose.
- Oh, sure. Yeah.
I'll introduce you later, fellas.
Gabe.
- I just stepped out for a bit of air.
- Yeah, we read the note.
Too bad, Gabe.
What do you mean? As a matter of fact,
I'm kind of relieved.
You know these famous gals, so stuck on themselves.
Who needs 'em? Now that I'm on my own,
I'll have me a real time.
So long, girls.
See you back on the ship, guys.
Why don't you stick with us?
You could get another date.
Claire'll get you a date.
Claire, how about a girl for Gabe?
I don't know any girls.
I can get you a date.
My roommate, Lucy Shmeeler.
What?
She's a nice girl.
She hasn't been out in years.
- She's swell. You'll like her.
- You'll like her.
How about it? I can phone her right now.
Sure. Why not? The night's young.
Come on.
We'll paint this town pink, green and yellow.
Get in there. Come on.
"That's all there is, folks
So goodnight to you
"We hope you liked our little
Shanghai Revue"
- How you doin', Gabe?
- Great.
Not thinking about that Miss Turnstiles, are you?
Who's that? Never heard of her.
Bottoms up.
Where's that heavy date you promised me?
- What's keeping Miss Shmeeler?
- She should be here by now.
When I told her about Gabey, she was out of the house before I could hang up.
- Playin' hard to get, huh?
- Where is she?
Hello, Lucy.
Hello. Oh, hello, Chip.
Well, now we've all got dates.
Lucy, this is Claire, and this is...
Don't tell me. I know.
I'll bet you're Gabey.
No. He's the lucky fellow.
The luck of the Irish.
- Won't you sit down, Miss Shmeeler?
- Thank you, thank you. Yes.
Gesundheit.
That's the nicest thing anybody ever said to me.
Here. You got a cold, huh?
It's just a little sniffle.
Nothing a ton of penicillin won't cure.
But it's not catching.
No, not even if you get real close.
Come on, Hildy. We'd better dance.
Let's go, Claire.
Have a drink, Miss Shmeeler.
I don't mind if I do.
You know, I was planning a quiet evening at home... but when Hildy called and said that the Navy was in distress, well, I just flew.
Hildy can tell you
I'm just "a streetcar named impulsive."
- Well, here's to...
- Here's to us.
My, that's strong.
- Did you see The Lost Weekend?
- See it? I feel as though I was in it.
I mean, until you came along, Lucy.
That calls for a real toast!
Let's pretend this is champagne.
Champagne?
Yes, and we'll do the real old-fashioned champagne toast.
- Let's interlock arms...
- No, really...
Come on. It's so Viennese!
Hey, Gabe!
Hiya.
- It's a small world.
- Hello, fellas.
- How about that introduction?
- Go away. Can't you see I'm busy?
Give us a break. We want to see the most beautiful gal in New York.
We wanna meet the little bombshell.
- Come on, fellas. You know how it is.
- Gabey, you're smothering me.
Hello.
Miss Shmeeler, this is First Class Seamen
Simpkins and Kovarski.
- Pleased to meet you, miss.
- Yeah. We been lookin' forward to this.
It'll give us a lot to talk about back on the ship, won't it, Gabe?
Yeah.
Well, so long.
Goodbye.
Magnetism, that's what it is.
Sheer magnetism.
Goodbye.
Oh, they're sweet.
Excuse me a minute, Lucy.
I gotta get some cigarettes.
I don't think Gabey's very happy about this.
Amazing. Amazing deduction.
Look!
Drinkin' alone, partner?
We don't like that around here!
We don't cotton to it no how.
Looks like you're trying to ditch us.
You can't get away with it.
Reckon you're stuck with us.
Yep! We're your pals, pal!
"Oh, when you feel downhearted
You must remember this
"Things never are as bad as they could be
"When friends have all departed
There's one you'll never miss
"I'll be right with you
You can count on me
"Yeah!
"You can count on me
"You can count on me
"As the adding machine once said:
"'You can count on me'
"If you committed murder
And got caught like a dope
"And had to hang until your life was done
"I'd holler: 'Go no further
Boys, fetch another rope
"'I'm hangin' with him
I'll stick to you, son'
"Yeah!
"I'll stick to you, son
"I'll always be beside you
"I'll stick to you, son
"We'll go through life together
"As the fly paper told the fly:
"'I'll stick to you, son'
"Yeah!
"Stick to you
"Stick to you
"Stick to you
"Stick to you
"I'll stick to you
"Oh, if you miss your mother
A million miles from home
"Think of how you once clung to her knee
"Your mother's knee
"Although there is no other
On land or sea or foam
"When you're in town, kid, you can cling to me
"Cling to me
"Cling to me
"Cling to me
"Cling to me
"You can cling to me
"If through a lot of foolery
You lost your last red cent
"I wouldn't even stop to ask you why
"To ask you why
"I'd pawn my mother's jewelry
I'd steal my sister's rent
"It's all for you, kid, you can milk me dry
"You can milk me dry
"You can milk me dry
"As the cow to the farmer said:
"'You can milk me dry'
"If on an island
We two were cast astray
"I'd make it into paradise, indeed
"If rescue came you'd only shriek at them 'Go away! '
"Because you'd find that I am all you need
"I am all you need
"I am all you need
"As the dough told the pastry cook:
"'I am all you knead'
"I am all you need
"I am all you need
"As the dough told the pastry cook:
"'I am all you knead'
"You can count on me
"Feel free to count on me
"You can count on me
"I mean to count on me
"As the adding machine once said:
"'You can count on me'
"Two, four, six, eight
Who do we appreciate?
"You can count on me!"
This is where I live.
It was very nice of you to take me home.
That's all right, Lucy. And thanks.
Would you like to come up for a minute?
No, I guess not.
The others are waiting for me.
Besides, I'm not very good company tonight.
I guess I showed you a pretty dull time.
Oh, no! I had a marvelous time.
At last I have something to write in my diary.
I've been using it for laundry lists.
No, really, I'm sorry about tonight, Lucy.
You know, somewhere in the world there's a right girl for every boy.
I guess I found the one for me before I even met you.
I tried, but I can't forget her.
But don't you worry.
You'll find your guy.
You're a nice girl, Lucy.
Goodnight.
Oh, you bad boy.
Now, I won't wash my cheek for a year.
Goodnight.
"A Day In New York.
"A comedy in three acts."
Hey, Gabe!
Hello, Chip.
I got kind of worried that you wouldn't come back.
Thanks, Chip. I'm okay.
I know how tough you're takin' this, Gabe.
I know you know. That's why I love you.
Come on.
When I danced in Imperial Palace before Czar, he wept... tears streaming on floor.
I had to do next number in galoshes.
- Madame Dilyovska.
- Yes, what is it?
Miss Smith's young friend.
- Where is she?
- Who?
Ivy Smith. She had to go to a big society party. Maybe you know where she is.
Big society party! This party is at
Coney Island, the playground of the rich.
- Coney Island!
- Yes, at Tilyou Avenue and the Boardwalk.
I know where she is.
- What's she doing there?
- I don't know.
Let's go.
I know the shortest way out.
We'll be there in no time.
- If I don't get my cab back...
- Look! That's them!
That's the cab.
Hey, you, stop!
Hey, fellows... where's the fire?
We're the fire! Hey, it's them!
They're after us!
- Who?
- The cops!
- Hildy, step on it.
- Okay.
Hildy, they're catching up with us.
I can see their faces.
It's no fun for them, either.
They can see yours.
Do you think we can lose them?
I know a place across the Brooklyn Bridge where no one'll find us.
- What is it?
- Brooklyn.
Get up there. You can see better.
Are they close?
Any closer and we'd be chasin' them.
- You better go faster.
- Hurry.
- Give her the gun.
- Hold on.
All police cars in the vicinity. Coming off the east end of Brooklyn Bridge.
- Heading east.
- Okay. Let's go.
We just picked up another one!
- I bet we're losing 'em.
- They're multiplying like schmos.
Pull into that fruit stand!
I wonder who's minding the police station?
This is Tilyou Avenue and the Boardwalk.
I wonder what she could be doing here.
- Doesn't look like a society party to me.
- Shut up, Chip.
Inside we feature Princess Yvette... the girl who picks up the handkerchief with her teeth.
Ivy!
Gabey!
All right, step up. Step up, folks.
Ivy!
Keep away from me! Keep away from me!
Now you know everything.
Here I am, Miss Turnstiles, the famous celebrity.
This is my big society party.
Why are you here?
You're not in the blue book.
Why did you leave me?
I thought I'd never see you again!
I had to come to work. I work here.
That's what I do.
I'm a kootch dancer.
I have to work because...
I owe Madame Dilyovska money for my lessons, and I have to pay her.
Excuse me, I have to go on now.
Ivy, I don't care about any of that.
I don't care what you do.
All I care about is that I've found you again.
Ivy, I thought I'd lost you forever.
Why did you run away?
Because I couldn't tell you about this.
I lied to you so much.
Did you think that would have made any difference?
And Madame Dilyovska threatened... to write what I was doing to my parents in Meadowville.
Meadowville?
Meadowville, Indiana?
Yes, I'm from there, and I had Miss Hodges for American history, too.
Holy smoke!
Did you hear? She's from Meadowville!
- No!
- That explains everything.
- The cops!
- Ivy. You're on.
- Where am I gonna hide?
- Where have I heard that before?
Come on. We'll comb the joint.
You girls see any sailors back here?
Sailors? Who'd notice a sailor with you around?
- Hey, you're pretty cute.
- So are you.
Get out there. Make with the wiggles.
We gotta sell some tickets.
Come on. Follow me.
Dance, dance, dance.
Come on. This way.
Sing.
"Pearl of the Persian Sea,
"When will you come to me?
"Across the desert sands
"I wait with outstretched hands
"Pearl, pearl of ecstasy"
Wait for me!
They're all yours.
I'm taking you girls to night court.
The rest of you stay here for questioning.
Where are the boys?
The Shore Patrol took 'em back to the ship.
- But they didn't do anything.
- You can't do that.
- We haven't even said goodbye to them.
- Little one, don't get upset.
Just a minute. We got a right to know what the charges are.
- You want to know what the charges are?
- Yeah.
Well, first of all, speeding... stealing a taxicab, destroying a dinosaur.
In general, disturbing the peace of our fair city.
For that, you separate three sailors and their girls... without allowing them a goodbye kiss?
For that, you throw three kids on a one-day pass in the brig? Speeding.
Ivy, tell them why we were speeding.
Well, Gabey thought he'd never see me again.
There, there.
And your dinosaur.
Why, Professor, you ought to feel proud about that dinosaur.
You ought to feel proud that three sailors from the United States Navy... got off the ship for one day, and what did they do?
Were they thirsty for hard liquor? No.
They were thirsty for culture.
Were they running after girls? No.
They came running to the museum to see your dinosaur.
For months out at sea they were dreaming about your dinosaur.
Is it any wonder that seeing it face to face, overcome by emotion... that one of them fell against it and broke it a little?
I'll bet if that dinosaur could speak, he'd say... what any public-spirited citizen would,
"For the Navy, anytime."
And the cab. We didn't steal it.
It was my last fare for the day.
And the biggest fare this cab company has ever had: $287.50
And why did I keep this fare all day, ladies and gentlemen?
Because I know my duty toward the servicemen.
There was this one...
He was just a little fella.
A skinny, little runt. He kept pestering me and following me around.
I couldn't shake him off. And, finally, he kind of got under my skin.
You would have done the same.
He wanted to see the beautiful sights of our beautiful city of New York.
And I showed him plenty.
And what do you think these boys think now of our New York hospitality?
Where's our civic pride?
We should have hugged them to our bosoms and said:
"Boys, the town is yours."
How about the speeding?
As a matter of fact, they weren't doing much over 35.
- They were crawling at a snail's pace.
- They were practically going backwards.
Just a minute.
Folks, it's 5:15, and these kids have just got time enough... to get down to the ship and say goodbye to the fellas.
Now, I want to see some action, and I'm gonna start it.
Come on.
"Hooray for the Red, White and Blue
"Say hooray for the Red, White and Blue"
"I feel like I'm not out of bed yet
"The sun is warm
"But my blanket's warmer
"Sleep
"Sleep in your lady's arms"
Hey, come on!
- "New York, New York
- New York, New York
"New York, New York
"It's a wonderful town
"New York, New York's
A wonderful town..."
Do you have to play that?
You ought to know better.
Run out. Run away.
Run off somewhere where they don't know you.
Bury your violin in the deepest hole.
Still won't do you any good.
You think you hate music now.
You don't, you couldn't.
Music is a compulsion, an obsession.
You'll blow up if you don't play it.
What did you think a concert career would be?
Something you put together with toothpicks?
Little ink spots and finger exercises?
Drop a nickel in the slot and out pops a concert?
Look at them.
Look at your beauties.
How many minutes, days, months, years of your life are bedded in the waxed wood?
There's your biography.
Paul Boray, virtuoso, artist.
Why don't you leave him alone, Bauer.
All my life I wanted to do the right thing.
But it never worked out.
I'm outside always looking in.
Feeling all the time
I'm far away from home.
And where home is, I don't know.
I...
I...
I can't get back to the simple, happy kid I used to be.
The kid I used to be.
Take that whistle out of your mouth.
You can't deliver groceries and blow a kazoo.
- Hi, Pop.
- Paul, off with coat, up with the tapioca.
Nope. Leave your coat on. Wash your face. You're going out with Papa.
- Paul is going out with Papa?
- You're gonna buy him a birthday present.
Why, Esther, Saturday's my busiest day.
Besides, you cooked him a cake.
When I was a boy...
What was a birthday without a present?
All right. I'll build him a nice house with a ketchup carton.
Take him to Jeffers.
Let him choose.
- He's too old to play house.
- He's too young to know what he wants.
No matter. If he wants it, it's a good present.
Well, here we are, Paul.
Lots of nice things, aren't there?
- Hello, Mr. Jeffers.
- Hello, Boray.
- For the boy?
- Who else?
Look around, Paul. Pick something, anything up to a dollar and a half.
Well? The sheep.
But the small one's better. Look.
It's almost human.
Wouldn't you like that?
No, that's for kids.
Maybe there's something for big boys.
Let's see. Oh, here's something.
A windmill.
- Don't you like that?
- No.
- He doesn't like it.
- Your boy like baseball?
Well, who doesn't like baseball in America,
Mr. Jeffers? It's an institution.
Bang, bang, Babe Ruth.
- Who else plays it?
- Ty Cobb, Hans Wagner.
Bang, bang, Hans Wagner.
Bang, bang, Ty Cobb.
Wouldn't you like to be a Ty Cobb, Paul?
No.
He doesn't want that.
- Hello, Paul.
- Hi.
- Wanna take some piano lessons?
- No.
I'll give you a special rate, 25 cents.
You pay, you'll be my only pupil.
No, violin's prettier than the piano.
Don't judge all pianos by the way
I look. Try it on for size.
- Could I?
- Sure.
If you play the violin, you'll have to carry a pianist around with you.
Play something.
I know that. Just give me a minute.
Paul. Paul!
Paul!
Another Paderewski in the family.
Phil with his kazoo and you with a violin.
- You said I could have anything.
- A drum, a little horse.
A toy is all right. What does a boy want with a violin?
For wood and glue?
Take the fire engine.
Let him take the fiddle.
He could do worse.
For instance, he might grow up to be a piano player.
You ought to know, Sidney.
Pianist and composer.
Rates on request.
The unknown genius waiting to be discovered. Do I strike your fancy?
- Not too much.
- Unfortunately, I'm not my own type either.
Listen, Sidney, as a musician...
...how much do you make per week or per year?
- Money? Cash money?
- Yes.
I'll write a song entitled,
"If I had a Million, Would I Talk to You?"
I'm a bargain-basement genius.
You want my son to be genius number two.
What a future.
Paul, take the baseball bat.
- I want the violin.
- He wants the violin.
Statistics show a million boys are crying for baseball bats.
It isn't good enough.
He has to have a violin.
Paul...
...take the fire engine.
- No.
The windmill.
- The baseball bat.
- No.
Then take nothing. Here.
Come on home.
Don't take it too hard.
You could imagine how much trouble
I had getting a piano.
Mr. Boray, you forgot your hat.
I'm sorry, Mr. Jeffers.
- What happened?
- Your son.
Your ungrateful son.
A toy isn't good enough for him.
Paul.
Didn't you see anything you want?
Didn't he see anything?
He certainly did.
In a black box like a dead fish.
A violin no less.
- A violin?
- He'll scratch on it for two weeks...
...then it's in the closet with Phil's saxophone. Remember his saxophone?
You hoped we had a musician in the family...
...because he followed the organ grinder.
But it was the monkey he wanted.
He asked for a violin himself and you didn't buy it for him?
- Is that why you're crying, Paul?
- I'm not crying.
Well, you're not laughing either.
Go upstairs. Put on a new face.
Put on your birthday face.
What are you doing? I forbid it,
Esther. It's throwing away money.
Waste and foolishness.
What for, Esther? What for?
It means something when he asks for something himself.
Means he's got an idea he'll forget in a couple weeks.
Maybe, maybe not.
Maybe our Paul will be different than Phil.
Maybe our Paul will be different.
Every mother thinks she has a son who'll be different.
But it's foolish I tell you.
It's the one on the counter in the little black box. Ask Sid Jeffers, he'll tell you.
He's ready to blow out the candles.
- Hi, Gina.
- Hello, Gina.
Hello.
- Happy birthday.
- Did you bring me a present?
Make a wish, Paul. Make a wish.
- Happy birthday, Paul.
- Gee, I blew out all the lights.
All right, Sister, turn on the lights.
Do you like it, darling? Do you like it?
Will you put that thing away?
Hey, we're gonna play ball.
Anybody wanna play ball with us?
- Hey, Phil, where's Paul?
- He's practicing.
- Does he have to?
- He don't have to.
You mean he wants to?
Mr. Boray.
Mr. Boray.
- Me?
- Mr. Boray, we don't expect you...
...to be with us all the time. But would you mind keeping in touch with us?
This overture is written for full orchestra not solo violin.
- Let's try it both ways.
- Let's try it as the composer wrote it, Boray.
All right. I'm sorry.
All right. Once more from the double bar.
This time, Mr. Boray has promised to rejoin the orchestra.
It occurs to me, Mr. Boray, you are very fresh.
Well, that's exactly the quality that I like in your playing.
All right. From the double bar.
I'm right behind you, Gina.
Get it? See what I mean?
Bach is church windows.
Beethoven is a giant range of mountains. Wagner is a storm.
- Debussy is the wind in the trees.
- And you? What are you?
Me? I'm the dynamo that makes them tick.
I'm a self-starter. I'll knock this town on its ear once I get started.
Nobody sits on my head.
It's full of talent.
Last week, I met José lturbi.
He told me, "Practice.
Learn what they want and play it."
Paul, we've passed my house.
Oh, I'm sorry. Remind me to let you get in a word every once in a while.
When I get wound up, I just go on and on until someone changes the needle.
- I know how you feel.
- Do you?
Really?
It's funny, you know, I never open up like this to most people...
...not even Mom. It's only you.
You know what I mean?
I don't have to pose with you.
I don't have to fight or argue.
I can be what I am, no different.
No better, no worse. Just me.
- You know?
- I know.
Gee, I'm itching to get started.
A thousand concerts in my fingers waiting to get out.
Nothing can stop me. Nothing can get in my way. I don't feel alive until...
Hey.
If I told you I loved you...
...would you laugh?
- No.
Well, I do.
You see, I'm not laughing.
Evening paper!
Get your evening paper! Thank you, sir.
- Hey.
- Evening paper!
- Read all about it!
- Hi, Eddie, how did the Yanks do?
- They won both games.
- Great. Thanks.
Thompson, $ 11.33.
Credit, credit, credit.
Nobody pays anymore.
I know they gotta eat, Esther, but we gotta eat too.
The Depression is a Depression for us and everybody.
What Depression?
With two chickens in every pot?
It's no joke, Flossie. It's no joke at all.
Who said it was funny? I got a run in my stocking. Will you fix it?
It's the last decent pair I've got.
- Phil, is that you?
- Yeah. They got new signs in the park now.
Instead of saying, "Please keep off the grass," they say, "Don't eat the grass."
- Any luck?
- There's nothing, Mom.
Not one job between the Battery and the Palisades.
- It's like banging your head against a wall.
- Did you eat?
No, I'm not hungry. What are you doing home? Get canned, did you?
- I could go and get your job.
- You're welcome to it.
They got a new idea.
I gotta go back to work tonight.
Open evenings for the rest of the summer, three times a week.
The customer's always right.
Does he have to play that violin all the time?
He's not bothering anybody.
I'll crawl in a hole till his nibs gets the urge to stop playing.
I'll retire from the human race.
Don't make any noise,
Paul is practicing.
Don't go in the room, Paul is studying.
Don't do this, don't do that.
It's coming out of my ears.
- He's working hard.
- He's working hard?
Oh, I forgot. I'm the one who isn't working. I'm on a vacation.
I go strolling every morning to smell the flowers and look at the birds.
Sure, he's the busy bee in this hive.
Poor Paul, working his fingers to the bone to support a no-good brother.
Philip is right, Esther.
We're one family.
- What's good for one is good for the other.
- Don't blame him, Rudy.
What can he do? Help like everyone else. Is that too much to ask?
This practicing, these teachers.
He'll never amount to anything.
- It's not for us.
- But, Rudy...
Look at the Jeffers boy.
He plays music too.
But at least he's on the radio.
He gets paid.
- It's different with Paul.
- Don't he eat?
Don't he wear clothes?
What's different?
- What's wrong with getting a job?
- There's nothing wrong.
- But if you can be a...
- Statistics show...
...there's one of those in a million.
Philip, put your shoe on, please.
Paul Boray.
The genius who lives over a grocery store?
- Now, Esther...
- Paul.
Happy days.
What's right is right.
I was just...
My father keeps saying it's a waste of time.
He doesn't understand me or my ambitions.
Nobody sits on my head.
I'm not gonna be a parasite.
From now on,
I pay my way. I want a job.
At 3:00 in the morning?
What kind of a job?
Playing violin.
What else do I know?
That's just what this Depression needs, another violin player. Cigarette?
No thanks, I've got one.
Hire a costume and play gypsy variations in a Hungarian restaurant.
- Don't horse me around, Sid.
- I'm not, Paul. I'm not.
You're such a schnook. You think decisions are made with flashlight bulbs.
Pop, and I'm a gypsy fiddler, or pop, I'm a virtuoso.
Leave that cord alone, you'll tear my shade.
You're no help. You're laughing.
- You're sensitive.
- I didn't come here to be analyzed.
That's the trouble. You want advice.
What makes you think I know?
I play piano in a monkey suit with a bunch of other guys dressed up in monkey suits.
Piano.
Schmaltz. Listen, Paul,
I can be unhappy in any key.
Depressed is my favorite word.
You know why? Schmaltz.
That what you want?
I know what I don't want. I don't wanna feel like a heel in my own house.
I don't wanna live over a grocery store...
...while feeding on gum and chocolate drops.
Hot in summer. Worrying about the bill that wasn't paid...
...or the bill that's coming in today.
Not me, Sid. Not me.
And you want me to tell you what to do.
You want me to tell you you're right.
Well, maybe you are. I don't know.
You can't advise talent.
Talent's a way of life.
Not something you can decide in a minute.
Who knows if you're gifted enough to be a concert violinist.
- That's the point.
- Is it? What?
Maybe I'll end up teaching kids how to fiddle. There's no guarantee.
There's no guarantee for anything real.
Would you say, "I'll marry you if I have a guarantee"?
- You're a dead pigeon with guarantees.
- Don't give me any lectures.
I know you like a book by now.
You're proud and sensitive. A little too intense and much too precocious.
Sincere but suffering from the old American itch.
You wanna get there fast, but you don't wanna pay for the ride.
All I'm asking you to do is to help me get a job.
- You think you can take it?
- I can take it.
We're running overtime.
There will be a cut here, gentlemen.
Cut from letter D...
...to letter R. That'll be eight bars from the end. Is that agreeable, Mr. Jeffers?
Why bring personalities into the discussion? I'll do it.
- From letter D to letter R, gentlemen.
- Why don't we just play two chords?
One to open and close.
It'll sound just as good.
Even for me, and I don't acknowledge myself to be the best pianist.
- That's quite a cut, doctor.
- Sid's right.
- I beg your pardon?
- I agreed. You're cutting out the best part.
- Let me be the judge of that.
- It's a matter of the composer's intention.
I apologize for making you unhappy, sir.
I take it you are displeased.
- Oh, I'll play it.
- Oh, you don't have to.
You'll be happier if you're not forced to play in our company.
We will just have to struggle along without you.
Hey, wait a minute.
Give the kid a chance.
He's never played on the radio.
Don't waste your breath, Sid.
Well?
- What'd you think?
- Coffee?
Look, I asked you a simple question.
Sugar?
You want me to blow kisses and shout bravo?
- You sound promising.
- Thanks, that's a crushing compliment.
From now on, you can sign your letters, "Paul Boray, fiddle player."
- I have spoken.
- Cut the gags. What'd you really think?
Little too brash, a little over-brilliant.
You need more restraint.
- You didn't like it?
- It's not important if I like it.
- The idea is for other people to share it.
- That's right. For once, we agree.
The point about an artist is the sound he makes, the personal sound.
It's his own sound like no one else, on a piano, a violin, on any instrument.
That's communicated between artist and audience.
That's what you call personality.
If he's got that, nothing matters.
If he doesn't, he might as well quit.
- You might have it.
- Then you think I'm terrific?
- You took the words out of your mouth.
- Am I ready for concerts?
- Sure.
- That's all I wanna know.
- Where you gonna play?
- I'll talk to them down at the school.
Rozner likes me, he'll put in a good word.
Wait a minute. Take a look at this.
Here's a list of this week's concerts.
There must be hundreds of them.
There's pianists, violinists, sopranists, tuba players.
All kinds of virtuosos.
You know what you're up against?
- What's that got to do with me?
- Want a debut?
You'll need a hall, tickets, a couple of posters, some ads, publicity.
Let's say $ 750 will do it.
Do you have $ 750 kicking around loose?
- I thought a manager takes care of that.
- For you?
They never heard of you.
They'd put you on, sure.
Only you pay.
What does he do, pat me on the back and pick my pocket?
Who goes to debuts?
Relatives and enemies.
You need connections to get people to come.
A manager supplies the audience. If he's good...
...he'll get a couple of critics to hear you. That's important.
My playing. Doesn't that mean anything?
Sure, you fill the lull between intermissions.
What are you gonna play on? Can't play a concert on a cut-rate instrument.
You need a Strad or Guarnerius.
Do you have a spare 25G's to buy one?
I studied ten years, practiced till my hands feel like wood. For what?
Don't give me any of that.
You should've told me this years ago.
You weren't good enough ten years ago.
You still thought music was all moonlight.
You play the piano.
What have you done?
It's what you don't become that hurts.
Idealism is a luxury for the very young.
You're full of lectures.
You know all the answers.
- You give me a pang.
- Don't get sore at me.
- I didn't make the world.
- You're always giving out with advice.
You ought to mind your own business.
I didn't ask you to play for me.
That was your idea.
- You wanted my opinion? You got it.
- I asked for an opinion, not a sermon.
You have all the characteristics of a successful virtuoso.
You're self-indulgent and the hero of all your dreams.
You ought to dream yourself.
It might make you less cynical.
When I look at you,
I know what I wanna avoid.
One of us is offensive.
Why don't you blow.
Tchaikovsky. Couldn't have happened to a nicer fellow.
What do you want it on, whole wheat or rye?
Okay, we're both crazy.
- Where do we go from here?
- How about a party?
- Fine, send down for a couple beers.
- I mean the real thing.
- Hear of the Wrights?
- They invented the airplane.
Helen and Victor Wright?
It's hard to avoid them.
Pictures on the society page.
Very social.
They have a yen for La Vie Bohème.
Good food, good liquor, open house.
- They invite me for laughs.
- I don't feel in the mood for a party.
Don't be stupid, sweetheart.
Everybody goes there.
Maestros and dipsos, corn-fed composers and calypsos.
It's the breeding ground for successful careers.
Dozens of them have been launched at the Wrights. Go put on your tie.
I'll crawl into my society pants.
Leave your hair mussed, you look pretty that way.
I'll skip this round, thanks.
- How are you this evening?
- Fine, fine.
Quite a party. Does this go on here all the time...
...or are you new here too?
- I'm an old hand at these parties.
- Who's that?
- Who?
- Over there.
- That's your hostess.
So that's Helen Wright?
They say she drinks like a fish.
Rumor hath it so.
Haven't you met her?
No.
She probably hasn't seen you yet.
- She's extremely near-sighted, you know.
- Really?
- What's her husband like?
- Weak.
Not a bad sort, just weak.
- Is he around?
- Yes, he's here.
- Where?
- Here.
Oh, Victor, Helen's been asking for you.
Oh, has she? Excuse me.
What do you do? You a fighter?
You look just like a prizefighter.
- Monte, I bet he's a prizefighter.
- I play violin.
I don't believe you. Go on, play a violin. I dare you.
I bet you don't know which end the music comes out of.
- The middle. It comes out of the middle.
- Monte, make him play.
- Would you?
- Sure, why not?
Just by accident, I happened to have brought my violin.
Wonderful playing, isn't it?
Every time I look at you,
I get a fierce desire to be lonesome.
You can leave any time you like, you know.
You're too shy to tell me you detest me?
- Have we met?
- Never saw you before.
- I've enjoyed every moment of it.
- I've seen you somewhere.
- You ride the subways?
- Not very often.
You probably don't recognize me with clothes on.
I pose for the underwear ads, the body, scrawny.
Well, as long as you can't resist me, sit down.
I still think you look like a prizefighter.
Sid, they want me to play.
- What are you gonna play?
- Zigeunerweisen. Give me an A.
Hey! You just spoiled the beginning of an odious relationship.
Okay.
Who is that?
I don't know. It's someone new.
With that talent, he'll probably end up in jail.
Why?
I don't know. I've just got an idea that all talented people end up in jail.
I make a stupid remark and you laugh.
You're stupid, Teddy.
Like him?
I'm constitutionally given to enthusiasm about nothing.
Get my glasses for me like a good boy, Teddy.
The genius needs a drink, Teddy.
- Gin or Scotch?
- No, thanks.
Two Scotches with a dash of heather.
You play like a calliope.
I beg your pardon?
There's an original answer for you. He begs my pardon.
You're not the man who got up and gave his seat to the lady on the subway?
Do you come from the provinces?
I was born in New York.
Oh, here's that rare animal.
A New Yorker from New York.
New York is full of all kinds of animals.
Not all of them were born here.
Did you mean that as an insult?
I'm a very difficult person to insult, Mr...
- You do have a name, don't you?
- Sure.
I'm in the telephone book under violins.
Mrs. Wright, this is my friend Paul Boray.
And I'm sure that any friend of mine is not welcome here.
Bad manners, Mr. Boray.
The infallible sign of talent.
Shall I make a prediction?
Soon the world will divide itself into two camps.
Pro-Boray and anti-Boray.
Which camp are you in,
Mrs. Wright? Pro or anti?
Why...? Why did Helen ride him like that?
She's merely getting interested.
- What else, Mrs. Cline?
- How much are your apples?
- Five cents a piece.
- I'll have one.
- What are you having, a party?
- Philip.
Finish this order.
Something else, Mrs. Cline?
- Do you have any butter?
- Lots of it.
- How much a pound?
- Forty-five cents.
At the corner, it's only 30 cents a pound.
- Why don't you get it there?
- They're out of it.
- When we're out it's only 10 cents.
- I'm gonna put him on the stage.
We just got some fine Wisconsin sauerkraut.
- Paul Boray?
- Yes, he's my son.
- Sign here, pappy.
- What else, Mrs. Cline?
- I'll have a box of soap flakes.
- Soap flakes.
And a dozen of eggs.
Thanks, pappy.
Eggs.
A bottle of milk.
Paul!
- Paul!
- Yeah.
- Come down. Package for you.
- Coming.
All right.
- And a box of salt.
- Okay. Need anything else?
I think that's all.
- Well, open it up.
- What is it?
- Cigarette case.
- For you?
Well, where did it come from? What for?
I played at a party last night.
You got it for playing the violin?
Partly.
They liked the way I play.
Who liked your playing?
What party?
People named Wright.
Wright, who are they?
Oh, the Wrights.
They know everybody.
They can help me a lot, Mom.
- I hope you've forgiven me.
- I don't hold grudges.
They're a waste of time.
You shouldn't have sent this.
I spend my life doing penance for things
I never should've done in the first place.
Don't you like martinis?
Not particularly.
They're an acquired taste, like Ravel.
I never had much time for acquired tastes, except for Ravel.
You make it all sound very grim.
What do you do for amusement?
Play the violin.
- Is that all you do, play the violin?
- Almost.
- Go to concerts?
- Not much.
When they're good, I'm jealous.
When they're bad, I'm bored.
Hobbies, pleasures or fun?
It's there in the violin for me.
- Girls?
- A few.
That's all?
That's all.
You're a very strange creature.
No stranger than you.
Me? There's nothing very strange about me.
I was married twice before.
Once at 16, once at 21.
One was a crybaby, the other a caveman.
Between them,
I said goodbye to girlhood.
You're still very young.
Take that glint out of your eye.
- Glint?
- That gleam.
I don't know how men get that way.
Every time you meet a woman...
...you begin to plan on how and where you can club her wings down.
I'm different, remember?
I'm the fella that's gonna split the world into two camps.
Besides, I thought I was your favorite unknown talent.
You are.
You're a very talented violinist.
I like to help talent when I can.
I'm interested in you as an artist.
And not as a person?
Only as an artist.
By the way, you don't have a manager, do you?
- No, no.
- You should have one, you know.
Do you know Bauer? Frederick Bauer?
Well, I've never met him.
- Yes, Mr. Bauer?
- Check open dates at Manhattan Hall...
...for a recital, violin.
Mrs. Wright will pay for it.
Esther, people are watching.
You must not do that.
He sounds better here than he does in the kitchen.
Ask Mr. Boray to join us.
Gee, l... I don't know, I...
I never thought I'd be so nervous.
I feel as if I've been through a six-day bike race.
I'm all in.
If you don't sweat, it's not good.
That's when you begin to worry.
You know, I thought I was better in the second half.
I kind of got warmed up a little.
Don't you think I was a little cold in the beginning? You know...
...the first few minutes
I didn't have any control.
Forget it. It was only perceptible to the whole audience.
On the level, Paul, it was really first-rate.
- You left them in a quiet frenzy.
- I don't know. I don't know.
I'd give anything to do the concert all over again.
No matter how many concerts, you'll always have the penalty of not satisfying yourself.
Preserve that feeling of dissatisfaction and you'll be okay.
Hey, wait a minute. This has to go on a headwaiter tomorrow night.
I'd like to go hide.
I don't wanna see anyone.
I tell you, you're in.
Ask me, an actual eyewitness.
I found the concert completely stultifying.
What more do you want?
Let's talk about something else.
What about ancient Greece?
What's your opinion of Greek civilization?
Quit it, will you?
Did you see the house out there?
Half empty. Some debut.
Rows of empty seats staring me in the face.
And then I fluffed that fast passage in the Brahms.
Don't worry.
You won't hear from Brahms.
Cut the gags out, will you, Sid.
Cut it out or get out!
I can't afford it.
You're the only friend I've got.
He has fire, this Boray.
Rather like what you find in a Van Gogh painting.
A touch of the savage.
Good for art.
That's why I was never an artist, my dear.
I'll go backstage and get Paul.
- We'll see you at home, Gina.
- All right.
- Let's go, Rudy. I wanna get things ready.
- Esther.
Maybe we can take the picture for a souvenir.
- There'll be other pictures.
- But it's a beautiful picture.
You wouldn't want to offend her. Helen would be disappointed if you didn't show.
- My family's having a party. Thanks.
- Oh, come along.
- You should go.
- For an hour. How about it?
Okay, just for an hour.
Another one, Paul.
"The debut of a violinist...
...of uncommon power and integrity is the news this morning.
It is difficult to remember a first concert equal to it for vir..."
- Virtuosity.
- "Virtuosity, musicianship...
...and the highest type of interpretation.
Paul Boray is a young violinist of great gifts."
You hear? He's talking about you.
- Bunk.
- I'll take the bunk for an appetizer.
Don't believe everything you read in papers.
- You came home late last night.
- Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry, Mom.
I couldn't get away. Honest.
That's all right. It was nothing.
Just cake and wine.
Makes no difference.
Where were you?
At the Wrights. Mr. Bauer thought I ought to go.
- Those are nice flowers.
- Gina brought them.
Oh, she did?
- Oh, I'll call her later.
- Paul, this is important.
Daily Progressive, high-class newspaper.
"Boray is undoubtedly a gifted young man.
But his tone has an unfortunate tendency to go off pitch in moments of climax.
Time and experience will perhaps correct this fault."
Yellow journalism.
- I saw them at the concert.
- What?
I said I saw Mr. And
Mrs. Wright at the concert.
Oh, you did?
She's a very beautiful woman.
Listen to this:
"The concert was notable for the unfailing beauty of tone."
See, I told you.
The other one was jealous.
Statistics show 80 percent of jealous critics...
...are broken-down, disappointed musicians anyway.
- Customers. I must show them the papers.
- Here.
No, no. This one is prejudiced.
It's nice of the Wrights to show such an interest in you.
It's the fiddle, Mom.
They like the way I play the violin.
I hate to take up your time like this, Mrs. Wright.
- I appreciate it.
- Nonsense. It wasn't my idea.
Bauer thought of it. I have the reputation for good clothes, food and wine.
Bauer said something conservative.
Yeah, conservative and dark.
The curse of classics. They demand respectability. Not that. Take the serge.
- Mrs. Wright knows value.
- You mean that?
Yes. A suit mustn't have bones like ribs in an umbrella.
It's the drape that does it.
I wouldn't know. I just have time to get dressed in the morning.
Mrs. Wright knows quality when she sees it.
I like the stripe better.
You can be a very obstinate man.
I began young. I once had a very bitter argument about a baseball bat or a violin.
And you got the violin.
I'm not with the New York Yankees.
Obviously.
- In the stripe.
- In the stripe.
Thank you, Mr. Boray.
- Well, what do you think?
- Good. Excellent in many ways.
Then you forgive me?
Forgiving you, Helen, is like an old and not unpleasant habit.
I knew you wouldn't come if
I told you to listen to a recital.
I think symphony conductors develop selective ears.
They can be very deaf on occasion.
- Where did you study?
- At the National Institute.
- With Rozner?
- Yes, sir.
- Where can I reach you?
- Through Bauer.
Bauer. You're in good hands.
Phone my secretary someday.
I'd like to talk to you.
- I will.
- Thanks again, Mr. Boray.
Goodbye, Mr. Jeffers.
If the orchestra's hard up for funds,
I'd be glad to help.
Thanks again for coming.
Give my love to Lisa.
I don't think he knew we were gonna play.
He didn't seem to mind.
He left the first chance he got.
Mr. Hagerstrom, mind dropping me off downtown?
I have to report to my parole board every two weeks.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Helen.
Why are you angry?
Didn't Hagerstrom know
I was coming here to play?
No, not quite.
You might've told me that.
- I took it for granted you'd want to play.
- I wanted to. I respect him.
- But that's not the point.
- What is the point?
The way you did it.
Without him knowing.
Look, it was for your sake I asked him up here. I don't play the violin.
The patroness of the arts. What am I?
A substitute for this year's trip to Sun Valley?
Think it's pleasant to be patronized by a woman?
Doesn't it occur to you to be grateful?
Sure. I'm grateful for the debut, for Bauer.
I'm grateful for the chance to play for Hagerstrom. That's the list so far.
- I'm in your debt.
- I don't recall having mentioned it.
Didn't do this for me. Did it for yourself.
The way you buy a racehorse or a yacht or collect paintings.
You just added a violin player to your possessions, that's all.
You're a mass of prejudices, aren't you?
So much thought and so little feeling. You...
I'm in no mood to argue the point.
I'll settle for a drink.
- Why do you drink so much?
- Ask me no questions and...
As me no questions,
I'll tell you no lies. Remember that?
Sure.
I also remember, "Beware of the Greeks bearing gifts."
Hello, darling.
- Paul.
- Victor, you're just in time.
- Paul was scolding me for my manners.
- Was he?
It seems I don't know the etiquette of gratitude. Bourbon for you?
- Won't you have something?
- No.
They say people who drink a lot are frustrated.
Or thirsty.
Or unhappy.
- Did you like Hagerstrom?
- Your wife was kind to introduce me.
You should've heard him.
He has original ideas.
He's been expanding on my general uselessness. Soda?
- Please.
- He thinks I live a wasted life.
Oh, Sinbad and the mermaid.
What news of the guppies?
- Meet interesting salmon?
- You don't know what you're missing.
- The water was wonderful.
- The water knows where to find me.
I believe in progress and American plumbing. When I need water...
...I take a shower.
- Wanna play catch?
- No.
Would you?
- No.
- You ungrateful people.
You invite me to the beach, drive me out in style to the cool breezes.
Take me out of the nice, hot, steaming city, and this is the thanks I get.
And what's more, I'm hungry.
This violent inertia gives me an appetite.
- You haven't been out of that chair.
- Every man has his own form of exercise.
This is your party.
You know your way around here.
Where's the food, or do we munch seaweed to keep in the spirit?
- Sandwiches are inside if you want them.
- You mean, I have to walk inside?
Wonderful sea air.
Do you ever get confused with all these spare mansions you have kicking around?
Beach house, town house, country house.
Personally, I get confused in a hotel room with an adjoining towel.
You get the feeling that I'm not wanted here?
Why'd you run away?
I don't like to be mauled.
I was only trying to help you.
I don't need your help. I'm perfectly capable of taking care of myself.
- I have a certain amount of pride too.
- Who says you haven't?
What are you afraid of, Helen?
I'm just careful.
- Of what?
- Of the world in general.
- That's pretty vague.
- It's a woman's privilege to be vague.
You want people to think you're brittle and shallow.
The woman with a gay gag, a wisecrack.
You're not really that, you know.
My friends will be delighted to hear it.
You're lonely.
You think you can fool me.
We're too alike. I know you too well.
You don't know me at all.
Why did you ask me out here today?
I was coming out anyway, and I thought you might enjoy it.
That's not true.
I don't like insolence, even from guests.
Tell me, Mrs. Wright, does your husband interfere with your marriage?
Why don't you play something?
I don't like to play the piano.
It makes me too attractive.
- Sandwich?
- No thanks. I'm on a liquid diet.
Drink?
No, I gotta get back for broadcast.
Clear head, nimble fingers.
- Just one?
- Broadcast.
I play background music for a drama called Life's a Dream.
The girl's going blind. Her boyfriend just discovered there's insanity in his family.
Mama's a widow with a mortgage years overdue.
The brother's wanted by the cops.
Otherwise, their life is one laugh after another.
I'm a man of fragments. Little here, little there. Beach, broadcast.
Nothing complete in my life...
...if I had a life.
Now, where were we?
I'm tired of talk. I don't like brainy people. They're usually very dull.
I prefer a touch of the brainless.
They're a happier breed.
You're making a big mistake.
You're brainless, you mean?
I can do anything a brainless man can do, and I can do it better.
That sounds almost like a challenge.
- I'm all right. Leave me alone.
- But your shirt's torn.
Don't touch me.
I said, I'm all right.
Leave me alone, Paul.
What are you thinking?
Nothing.
Don't nibble on the grass.
It stains your teeth.
You might be sorry love was ever invented, Paul.
I'm not a simple person.
I have my faults.
Who hasn't? I have a quota of them tucked in my back pocket.
I don't keep mine hidden though.
I wear them like medals.
I'll take my chances.
Ever since I can remember,
I've been a law to myself.
People were stupid enough to put up with it.
You never did.
- And you liked that?
- No, I hated it.
I was afraid of it. I still am.
Why?
It takes a great deal of courage to look at ourselves as we really are.
I never wanted to.
So I drink.
That's the truth, pure and simple.
The truth is never simple.
I know that.
The truth is, I love you.
I can't fight you any longer, Paul.
Hello, Mom.
- There's some cold chicken in the icebox.
- This is plenty. Thanks.
Want some hot coffee?
This is fine.
Gina called. You had a date with her.
I'm sorry. I forgot.
- She's a nice girl.
- Yeah.
Maybe it's none of my business, Paul, but I wasn't born yesterday.
- I see what's happening.
- Nothing's happening.
You should know.
What do you think, Mom?
She's a married woman.
What do you think?
- I don't know.
- When will you know?
- They'll publish the scandal in the papers.
- Nobody's publishing anything.
Oh, they did it to better men.
You're a clean boy with a clean career, why get involved?
- I tell you, I'm not involved.
- You'll have to get up early to fool me.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Paul.
My opinion of Mrs. Wright doesn't matter...
...but I know you.
Inside, Paul, you want a wife, home, children.
- Let me live my life. I know what I want.
- Don't let your life get twisted.
It's not the same for you.
Your life is different.
You're not someone who can put work in one drawer, his life in another.
Everything you do, everything you think is a part of it.
Wind me up and I play. Concerts on request. Is that all I'm supposed to be?
I want more. I'm not a machine.
I've got feelings too.
You have to pay for what you get.
Special people got special things to pay for.
- What's left for me?
- Music.
Be careful.
The stakes are big. This isn't a two-hour trip to Chinatown. This is for life.
Think of the future. Think of what it'll be next year and the year after.
Think of your work.
So long, Fitzie.
Gina.
- It's good to see you. How are you, Gina?
- Hello, Paul.
I hear the tour went well.
Bauer thinks so.
Is he doing anything for you?
It's slow. I'm with the Block String Quartet.
Leopold Stokowski organized a youth orchestra.
I thought Mr. Bauer might arrange an audition for me.
- It's arranged. Let's have lunch together.
- I really must wait...
Sid's going to be there.
The Block String Quartet.
Why hasn't anyone told me?
Gee, it's nice to see you.
- Why is Sid always late?
- You know Sid. He has no sense of time.
It's a modern invention.
Sid has no use for modern inventions.
Maybe he's right. No one seems to have time anymore.
I've been up to my ears, the tour, recordings, Bauer. You know.
- No, I don't.
- You're not angry with me, are you?
You're a blank check in my emotions.
Any amount you want you can write in.
- Gina, what's the matter with you?
- You've changed.
Me? Maybe you've changed.
You're successful. You're in the limelight.
That makes you different.
Maybe I'm a little jealous.
We ought to be able to forget old friends, pack them away in some dim corner.
- That would be the kindest way.
- What do you expect me to say?
Roses are red, violets are blue and so am I?
I'm blue.
Gina! This is like old home week.
You look lovely. Has anyone told you? Let me be the first.
Helen, I...
Do you know Mrs. Wright?
This is Miss Rommeney.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Every day and every way.
Here, let me give you a kiss.
- Well, won't you join us?
- Sorry. I can't stay.
I just came to add my congratulations to the general acclaim.
Excuse me, please.
Hey, wait a minute.
Thanks for the lift downtown.
See? When I'm courteous, I'm ignored.
- Maybe I'll never see him again.
- You'll see him again.
Temporarily, he's on his way to placate a jealous woman.
- You hear about the tour? We stunned them.
- Sid, what is she like?
Helen?
She's as complex as a Bach fugue, born with a silver flask in her mouth.
Helen has a big alumnus association behind her.
- She's quite a gal.
- So it seems.
- You're quite a gal yourself.
- You're nice, Sid.
Say I'm wonderful or unbearable, but don't ever say I'm nice.
I was in love once. It took me two weeks to get over her.
I played all the 32 Beethoven sonatas.
It took exactly two weeks.
So it ain't funny. Why don't we get drunk.
Drink to laurel wreaths and curtain calls.
- To fame, fortune and success.
- I wanna get out of here.
Sure.
There's an old Irish saying. "Light your pipe.
There's only wind and smoke in the world."
Translation: Easy does it.
Easy does it every time, baby.
Want piano lessons? Twenty-five cents a lesson, you'll be my only pupil.
You think you're better than I am, don't you?
- For you, sir?
- Sure, why not.
- How many years did you study the whistle?
- It's a secondary instrument with me.
- The violin is my dish.
- Where did you meet her? Philadelphia?
- Is she one of your ardent admirers?
- Gina is an old friend.
Obviously.
Did you play hopscotch with her on the sidewalks in your youth?
She was at the Institute.
She's a musician.
That must give you a great deal in common.
- Invite me the next time you play a duet.
- I will.
Why didn't you call me?
Philadelphia isn't the end of the world.
I didn't want to.
Thanks. That's nice of you.
- I wanted time to think.
- How convenient.
Men want the convenience and none of the difficulties.
- What did you think about, Tchaikovsky?
- I thought about us.
- You don't expect me to believe that.
- I don't care.
- I'd like to slap your face.
- Why don't you try it.
I'm sorry I did that.
The glass is wet.
It makes circles on the table.
Let's get out of here.
- I'm tired of quarrels.
- It's not my doing. I didn't want it.
Did you think you could go away for weeks, never call or write...
...and come find me hanging in a closet like a suit you might put on someday?
Paul, what good is a woman if she's no use to anyone?
I...
- I owe you a great deal.
- Oh, give it to charity.
Let me help you.
Let me help in the small ways that I can.
You have talent, something solid to hang onto no matter what happens.
I envy you that.
I'll live without the grand opera love is supposed to be, only...
...don't close me out of your life.
Please don't.
Take me into your life.
You're married, Helen.
We're both old enough to vote.
It makes me laugh, how much alike we are.
This sparring around like two wrestlers looking for a hold.
At times, a sense of humor's welcome.
We don't laugh enough. That's our trouble.
It's your fault.
I think you were born angry.
- I don't like angry people.
- Evidently, you don't think much of me.
I love you, so I don't care what I think of you.
Mr. Jeffers, is Mr. Boray your protégé?
Our relationship is like
George Sand to Chopin.
Could you induce Mr. Boray to come to a small party tonight?
- I'll have to see the guest list first.
- Mr. Jeffers!
I'll have to call off our date.
I'm sorry. It's okay, let him in.
- I'm his cousin.
- They don't even believe I'm his father!
- I hope that hasn't troubled you before?
- Wait, Sid. Esther. I forgot.
Esther and the whole family are in there. Let's go in.
- Imagine. I'm his father.
- You're brilliant, Mr. Boray.
Paul, you were wonderful.
- My boy.
- Terrific, Paul.
I hope I can play as well as you.
Bravo! Bravo! Encore! Encore!
I'm the second greatest pianist.
I won't mention the first.
Too many guys would get sore.
- You're the most conceited.
- I like to be the best.
- Many objectionable people have talent.
- Is that so?
I know a lot of talented people who are objectionable.
- Is that so?
- Where's that magazine?
The one that said I'm the white hope of the musical world.
It's gotta be easy enough to find.
You bought 12 copies.
Here it is.
- Not bad.
- First, they discovered Bugs Bunny...
...then Jack Benny and Shostakovich.
Now the great Paul Boray!
What? Don't I rate their praises?
You rate a kick in the pants if you believe everything.
The prosecuting attorney in my life.
You won't let me think I'm good.
- Your schooling's ahead, Paul.
- That's tough.
You follow one success with another.
Then we'll see how tough you are.
- Mom, Pop, how are you?
- Hello, Paul.
Come on in.
- Hello, Sidney.
- Hello.
- How do you like it, huh?
- Wonderful.
Well, it looks bigger than it is.
It's only two rooms, a bedroom, this room and kitchen.
I'm gonna work in here.
Come on, look around.
We got a real view.
We can see the river.
You know, we can get a sea breeze too.
Why, it's an eagle's nest.
- How do you like it, Mom?
- Where did you get the drapes?
Mrs. Wright picked them out.
You like them?
- Nice drapes.
- That's the kitchen. It's not very big.
But then I'm not a very good cook.
Well, Sidney, what do you think of my Paul's apartment?
I don't know what to say.
Paul has an itch to live a life of fashion and nothing will cure him.
Everything's so expensive and fancy, but what is this ugly pot doing here?
My psychoanalyst told me it reminds me of something that happened in my youth.
So long as you're happy, Sidney, that's all that matters.
Esther, look, our picture's in a silver frame. It's nice, isn't it?
A woman told me this morning
I look like an owl. I don't see it.
I think Mom's still mad at me.
Paul, you know women. All mothers think their son's a baby till he gets bald.
No, I don't think she likes the apartment.
I don't think she thinks it's right. Do you?
Well, with all due respect, there are some things, but...
Paul, do what you think is right.
Statistics show you'll never be wrong.
- Now, what's through here?
- The bedroom, dressing room and shower.
A room for every occasion.
It's wonderful.
- What do you think you'll find, Mom?
- What I find wherever I look.
- I can't take this seriously.
- You don't know what you're doing.
- Mom, don't be old-fashioned.
- Is that what you call it?
It's your life, but remember, I told you.
All right. I'm in love with her.
Is that what you want me to say?
You know what she is. There's something wrong with a woman like that.
- Please, you don't know what you're saying.
- Believe me, it's no good.
- What can marriage mean to her?
- You never gave her a chance.
You never liked her, never tried.
- I won't have you talk about her.
- I need your permission?
Don't try to tell me what to do!
Paul, did you know man is 60 percent water? I read it in the paper the other day.
There's a leak here.
Talk to the landlord about it.
I'll talk to him.
- Is it really possible to hit the bull's eye?
- Yes, with practice.
- Like everything else, I suppose.
- Like most things.
Had a curious conversation the other day.
A friend of mine...
...wanted some advice.
He's having trouble...
...with his wife.
A young man involved.
And he, my friend, doesn't quite know what to do.
Of course, he hasn't the right to do anything.
- No? Why?
- He's only an excuse for a man, really.
Never done very much.
Never wanted to.
Fates and a few energetic ancestors...
...have allowed him to lead a rather soft and easy life.
On the whole, he prefers it that way.
Naturally, his wife...
...quite a personality in her own right, never liked that.
Always a bit contemptuous of him.
The peculiar thing is that he loves his wife very much.
In his own way, of course.
He's never been able to prove it to her.
Not man enough, I suppose.
Not enough character, as the Good Book says.
Still, he's learned to make less mess in public than any man living.
Of course, that's only a negative virtue.
It doesn't fool a wife for very long.
What do you know?
I hit the bull's eye.
So all things considered, he's thinking of giving his wife a divorce.
- You think that's a reasonable solution?
- Victor, stop it.
- Why don't you.
- There's nothing to stop.
- Rumor has it otherwise.
- Only rumor?
No backstairs gossip?
No anonymous letters?
I'm sorry, Helen...
...rumor is a dubious and rather nasty authority.
What can this boy give you?
Suppose you do marry him...
...how long would it last?
How long before you get tired of him, or he of you?
You know yourself better than anyone else, Helen.
Can you change now?
And if you don't, do you really believe he'll change?
He doesn't know what it means to be soft.
Nothing means anything to him but music.
- I never said I wanted to marry him.
- Do you love him?
You say you've loved me, Victor.
But what kind of a love has it been?
I know you've always been courteous and always remembered my birthday.
But is that the final sum and substance of our marriage? Courtesy and greetings?
I know what I am.
I know what I've become.
I've never had the chance to love.
You don't like emotions.
They're wearing. They make demands.
They interfere with the pleasant life.
So I've learned to hide away love and hate and everything strong in me.
I've tucked them away where they wouldn't bother us.
We've hung a sign on our lives,
"Do Not Disturb."
You can have the divorce, Helen.
- Mr. Boray, a note for you.
- Thanks.
- May we take it again from letter G, please?
- Certainly.
- Thanks.
- Letter G.
- Hello?
- Hello, Sid?
- Yeah?
- Have you seen Helen?
She was supposed to meet me
at the club for dinner.
It's 2:30 in the morning.
Have dinner alone.
- Stop kidding. Have you seen her?
- She was with Loeffler. Try Teddy's bar.
- Okay.
- If not, call me back in an hour.
I ought to be asleep by then.
Does she have to sing that?
Why don't you hire a good trombone player, Teddy.
Ask her to stop, Teddy.
She's annoying Mrs. Wright.
No offense, I hope, Teddy.
No offense, Mrs. Wright.
No offense.
Well, what do you know?
This place is haunted.
Hello, Paul.
How about a drink for the gentleman, Teddy.
What are you looking at?
Don't you want a drink?
- Gentleman's changed his mind.
- You've had enough.
I'm thirsty.
- Nothing for you? Sure?
- Nothing.
I wanna take you home.
The gallant knight.
Quiet. Soft music.
My friend's being considerate.
He wants to take me home.
- The way you took me to dinner?
- I'm sorry. I was held up.
- The rehearsal lasted longer.
- I can't spend my life waiting.
- I came as soon as I could.
- Wasn't soon enough.
Helen, I'm tired.
- Only the usual.
- I wanna go home, get some rest.
- Go ahead.
- You're coming.
Leave me alone.
Go back to your music. I'm tired of playing second fiddle to the ghost of Beethoven.
- Put it down.
- Mind your own business.
- No offense. Mind your own business.
- I said, put it down.
- Look, I don't think Mrs. Wright wants...
- Take your hands off him, Teddy.
I'm sorry. No offense.
That's my line, no offense.
No offense, anybody.
- Let me alone, Paul. I'm a lost crusade.
- Turn around.
You're a hangman's noose to me.
Please leave me alone.
Say good night.
Good night, Monte.
- Night, Teddy.
- Night, Helen.
Night, Mrs. Wright.
A French philosopher once listed
300 ways of committing suicide.
- Yeah?
- He left one out:
Falling in love with an artist.
Be careful, that's the only pot that was ever true to me.
Drink your coffee.
Here we go again.
Only a man who doesn't drink...
...thinks black coffee sobers you up.
- I envy people who drink.
- They know what to blame everything on.
- If it's so simple, why don't you drink?
- I have no character.
- Don't brag.
- How do you feel?
- Who, me?
Oh, wonderful.
I need a hot towel or a cold shower.
Either or both or vice versa.
I hate cold showers. They stimulate me.
- Then I don't know what to do.
- Try getting some sleep.
It's an idea, not original.
I had the idea hours ago.
You were playing games with phones and doorbells.
Maybe it's a personal idiosyncrasy of mine, but loud noises never put me to sleep.
- Sure there's nothing else I can do?
- Yeah, I'm sure.
Maybe I can play the Hammerklavier sonata.
Takes an hour if I leave out the repeats.
Good night, Sid.
- Sure you don't need me?
- Good night, Sid.
Okay, remember, I'm not taking any more calls tonight.
I'm entered in a dog show.
I have to be up at 6:00.
- Think I have a chance?
- You'll do great.
Autumn's a sad time of year.
When I was a kid, it meant the holidays were over. Back to school.
It's a pretty sight from up here. Not so pretty close up, though. Nothing ever is.
The Boray point of view.
The top of the world.
- What are you thinking about?
- What happened tonight?
I spoke to Victor.
He'll give me the divorce.
- Did you hear?
- Yes, I heard.
- He was very kind about it.
- Was he?
What else did he say?
- Nothing.
- What else did he say, Helen?
- I tell you, that's all he said.
- Then why the tears? Why the dramatics?
Why not? I'm losing a husband.
You're hiding something.
I know you too well. What happened?
- Why did you go out with Monte?
- He offered to buy me a drink.
- You do well enough without him.
- I like to drink.
- It's an escape you once told me.
- I once told you I loved you.
Why don't you remember that?
- Helen, Helen...
- Don't hold out hope. Beware of pity.
I love you. I wanna marry you.
Marry. It's an easy word to say, isn't it?
It rolls so trippingly off the tongue.
The bride wore white. No.
That's only for the first marriage.
Red for the second, black for the third.
- Stop it.
- What are you afraid of, Paul? The truth?
You don't want me, not really.
It's someone you made up.
You need the homemaker type. Outside of music, you cherish standard virtues.
No, you don't want me, Paul.
I'm too wearing on the nerves.
- Why hold up the wall? Let it fall.
- You don't know...
- I won't change, you know.
- I'm not asking you to anymore.
- It won't work, I tell you.
- How do we know?
Why don't you say it?
Speak out clear with courage.
Can't you say you don't love me and never wanna see me?
- I wanna marry you.
- You're married already. Married to work.
You're married to your music.
You'll never marry me.
Don't forget your music, Paul.
Don't ever forget your music.
- How I hate music. I detest it.
- Stop it. Stop it.
Don't fight. Don't try to fight anymore.
No, I won't. I can't.
I love you, Paul.
I love you.
- Hello, Mrs. Sheff. What can I do for you?
- I want some candy for my Monroe.
I have just what you want.
- All-day suckers.
- They're so small.
But the days are getting shorter,
Mrs. Sheff.
- And I want some bologna.
- I have some nice bologna with garlic.
Over on this side.
Oh, excuse me.
I'll be with you in a minute.
Mrs. Wright.
Hope you don't mind my coming.
I should've called.
Oh, don't apologize.
It's a pleasure. It's an honor.
I bet you haven't been in many grocery stores, have you?
It's too bad it isn't tomorrow.
I'm getting a new slicing machine.
Paul bought it for me.
Cuts bread and everything.
Would you believe it?
You push a button:
The slices come out even.
I don't think Mrs. Wright came to hear these things, Rudy.
- Will you come upstairs, Mrs. Wright?
- Thank you.
Mrs. Wright of Fifth Avenue, friend of the family.
- I've got friends on Second Avenue.
- I'll cut your bologna.
Why did you come here?
You didn't have to.
I have one virtue, Mrs. Boray.
I've never lied to myself.
I've lived a meaningless and absurd life among silly and rather futile people.
I tried to run away from it.
The easiest way, of course, was drinking.
- But it didn't work.
- And now it's Paul?
Another chance to run away.
Another chance to escape.
Oh, no. No, Paul never meant that to me.
Do you know why I tried to help him at first?
I thought he needed my money. But he didn't.
He wants to marry you. Marry.
You've been married before, Mrs. Wright.
How many times? Three, four?
And you've failed. And if you fail now, what happens to Paul?
What about his work, his music?
He's put his whole life into it.
Do you know what that means to him?
You talk about love. What love?
You only make demands.
You only think of yourself.
You give nothing in return.
Leave him, Mrs. Wright.
Leave him alone.
- How old was he then?
- Eleven.
You know, every time I play a concert,
I feel those critical knives being sharpened.
And my scalp begins to tingle.
Say, did Sid tell you about Helen and me?
- Yes, since you asked.
- She's getting a divorce.
Well, what do you think?
She's gonna marry me.
She'll add salt and pepper to your life.
She's quite a woman, if I'm any judge.
- Is she drinking?
- Not a drop.
Well, that's more than
I can say for myself.
- But then, I'm not in love.
- I know your type.
You believe in marriage only as a last resort.
- How are you feeling this evening, sir?
- Complicated question. Haven't time for that.
- Helen's tickets are still at the box office.
- Are you sure?
She may be a little late.
It's a long drive down from the beach.
My mother?
The box is empty.
Thanks.
Hello.
Just a moment. It's Helen.
Helen. Helen, where are you?
Why aren't you here?
Always the same thing. I have enough to think about without trying to figure out...
...where you are and what you're doing?
Don't you realize I have a concert to play?
Do you wanna ruin my concert, ruin my career, ruin everything, is that what?
Where are you?
What are you doing?
- Are you drinking?
- No.
No, I'm not drinking, really I'm not.
But I swear it, darling.
Please believe me, and don't scold.
I don't wanna be scolded anymore.
Yes. I should've called you.
I meant to come, up to the last minute.
I was all dressed and ready, as a matter of fact... What?
But, Paul, it's so quiet here.
It's such a long drive and then there will be so many people.
Please try and understand.
Don't make me explain.
It isn't as if I'll miss the concert. I won't.
The radio's on now. Can you hear it?
Paul?
You're still angry, aren't you?
Oh, yes, you are. I can tell.
Don't, Paul. Don't.
But of course I want it to go well. You know that.
Oh, listen to me. Listen. Darling,
I'm sorry. I don't mean to worry you.
You mustn't worry because everything's all right.
It's just that it's so quiet here.
The rest and quiet are doing me a world of good.
It's so beautiful and peaceful.
There isn't a soul on the beach.
I can see the sky in the water.
There's a smudge of smoke out there almost at the horizon.
It must be a boat, far, far out.
Paul, I wish we were onboard that boat.
So far out that we couldn't see anything but sky and water.
Nothing more.
What?
You didn't hear?
No.
No, it wasn't important.
Really, it wasn't.
Yes. Yes.
No, he's gone. I told him he could go.
There's no one here. I'm all alone.
But of course I'm all right.
There's nothing wrong.
I'll tell you what. Come down tomorrow and we'll drive back to town together.
What? Tonight?
All right, darling. Tonight if you want.
Oh, yes, I'll wait.
Paul? Paul, hello?
It's nothing. I just thought you'd hung up, that's all.
Who?
Well, you go ahead. Of course
I understand. And good luck, darling.
Paul.
I love you.
This is Robert Corten again, talking
to you from Symphony Hall.
We now come to our guest soloist
for this evening, Mr. Paul Boray.
Mr. Boray is making his entrance onstage,
followed by Mr. Sidney Jeffers.
Mr. Boray will play his own transcription
of music from Richard Wagner's opera...
...Tristan and Isolde.
The houselights are lowered.
Here's to love.
And here's to the time when we were little girls...
...no one asks to marry.
You know yourself better than anyone
else, Helen. Can you change now?
And if you don't,
do you really believe he'll change?
He doesn't know
what it means to be soft.
Nothing means anything
to him but his music.
Can't you realize I have a concert
to play tonight?
Do you wanna ruin my concert, ruin
my career, ruin everything, is that what?
Why don't we go home.
There's nothing we can do here.
I...
I need a shave.
Having to shave every day. It's silly.
Shave every day. Why?
Why do I have to shave every day?
She once asked me what it was like to live up here.
The Boray point of view.
It's lonely.
It all seemed so simple once.
Live your life, do your work, as simple as all that.
You find out it's not that easy.
Nothing comes free.
One way or another, you pay for what you are.
Yeah.
Tell Bauer not to worry.
I'm not running away.
[ENGLISH]
Over here.
Steve Martin's the name.
It grew.
Thank you. Tell you what I'll do.
You call out a tune, and I'll play it.
Stay in Your Own Backyard.
Too dirty back there.
- Any other tune?
- Banks of the Wabash.
Banks of the Wabash. All right.
Now I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll play it if you folks will sing it. Right?
The key of C, Professor.
So you won't sing?
Am I asking you to do me a favor?
I'm doing you a favor.
When you sing, what happens?
Your lungs get full of oxygen.
It puts roses on your cheeks.
As a matter of fact, you either sing out, or you get out.
Now that we understand each other, let's go, Professor.
The breath of new-mown hay
Through the sycamores
the candle lights are gleaming
on the banks of the Wabash, far away
Fine. Stand up and let the folks see you.
Don't be bashful. Come on, stand right up.
Come on, folks, let's make him stand up.
Attaboy! Let's have it again.
Give that boy a spotlight!
Professor, let's have the chorus again.
Oh, the moonlight's fair tonight
along the Wabash
From the fields there comes the breath
of new-mown hay
Through the sycamores
the candle lights are gleaming
on the banks of the Wabash
far away
- What's your name?
- Asa Yoelson.
Are you in show business?
No, sir, I'm not.
Where'd you learn to sing like that?
I sing with my father at the synagogue.
- Where?
- At the...
The synagogue!
Wait a minute!
Sonny, wait a minute!
Answer me, Asa.
Where were you all that time?
You came like someone who is running a race.
It's not good to run a race with God, Asa.
Where were you, Asa?
I was... singing.
You mean you stayed home?
- Practicing, is that what you mean?
- No.
Then where were you singing?
Stop cracking your knuckles.
In the street, maybe?
That's not exactly where I was singing.
Singing prayers in the street.
- No, not exactly.
- Exactly?
You must have been exactly somewhere... singing exactly something...
- and for some exact reason.
- Yes, Papa.
My name is Martin.
I'd like to talk to you for a minute.
Hello, Asa.
You're Cantor Yoelson. I'm Steve Martin.
- How do you do?
- I'm glad to know you.
Your son has a real voice.
You were at the synagogue today for the service?
Me? No. I just went by there to find out where you lived.
Then where did you hear my son sing?
- At Kernan's.
- Kernan's?
Yeah. The burlesque house a few blocks from here.
The burlesque theater?
- Don't you ever go there?
- No, I do not.
That boy's got a future in show business.
I've looked for something like him for a long time.
I'd like to make him a regular part of the act.
You've nothing to worry about.
I'm booked solid for the season.
I move on to Baltimore tonight.
- Baltimore.
- I know he's pretty young... but when a boy's got a voice like that, he ought to let people hear it.
You're right, Mr. Martin. Asa will sing.
But where his people have always sung.
I know how you feel.
It's a beautiful thing to sing in church, but there's a lot to say for the theater, too.
If you're worried about my taking care of him...
Excuse me, Mr. Martin.
I think I know what's best for my son.
I was afraid that's how you'd feel about it.
Sorry, Asa.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I want your promise that you'll never go to that place again.
I can't.
- I can't promise.
- Go to your room.
Ann, go downstairs and get a ladder.
Put it here.
- Why?
- Hurry up. Get the ladder.
What'd you bring me here for?
Why don't you let me find Steve Martin?
What kind of a car was that you jumped out of?
A cattle car.
What difference does that make?
All the difference in the world, my boy.
- Here's another one, Father.
- Let me go.
Yes, let him go, Riley. Don't mind him.
He just thinks he has to behave like a policeman.
I don't think he understands boys.
No? I've only got seven of them myself.
That's just what I mean.
Now, suppose you tell me about yourself.
Where are you from?
- Where was he picked up?
- In the freight yard.
He came in on a cattle car. Can't you tell?
If you knew about freight trains, you'd never pick a cattle car.
- I had to get here.
- To Baltimore? Why?
- He's got a job here.
- What kind of job?
- Singing.
- Singing? Where?
In a show with Steve Martin.
He's in Baltimore right now.
What about your family?
Do they know about this?
I see.
Before we do anything else,
I think you'd better have a hot bath.
- And something to eat, John.
- Come on, my boy.
Why don't you find Steve Martin and ask him?
That's just what I'll do.
Since it's singing he's interested in, why not let him sing?
Sing?
Tell me a little more about your work in the theater, Mr. Martin.
I've told you about all there is.
Pardon me, Father. I don't get it.
Why would you be bringing me here, asking me all these questions?
- Is there something you want me to do?
- I'll come to the point in a little while.
- Cantor Yoelson? I'm Father McGee.
- How do you do?
Mrs. Yoelson.
Hello, glad to see you again.
- You know Mr. Martin?
- We know him.
- Is our boy here?
- The description is like Asa.
I have a very strong feeling that...
So have I.
Singing without his cap on.
It's not so much what's on the head as what's in the heart... is it, Cantor?
Hello, Mama. Hello, Papa.
Beautiful song, wasn't it?
Get ready, Asa. We're going home.
I'll do it again, Papa. I'll run away.
- I'll find Mr. Martin someplace.
- Now wait, Asa.
I wouldn't have you in the act if I didn't have your father's consent.
Then I'll get in another act.
I'll keep running away.
- What are we going to do with him?
- We'll decide that at home.
Maybe we should decide now, Papa.
You said you would take very good care of our boy?
- You would consider this foolishness?
- I'm only asking, Papa.
If Asa is going to keep running away,
I have a right to ask.
I made inquiries about Mr. Martin.
He's a man who can be trusted.
I'm sorry I started all this trouble and I wouldn't have more to do with it... but considering his feelings about show business...
Show business!
Tell me, Mr. Martin, exactly what would Asa do?
The same as I did at Kernan's, Mama.
- Isn't that what you mean, Mr. Martin?
- Yes.
Mr. Martin's onstage asking everybody to sing, but nobody does...
'cause they're waiting for someone else to begin.
I'm up in the balcony, and Mr. Martin says:
"Come on, folks! Join in the chorus!"
"Don't be bashful. All together now."
All of a sudden,
I stand up in the balcony and start singing.
I'm dumbfounded at the kid's voice, and I say:
"Give that boy a spotlight!"
"Give that boy a spotlight!"
I love you
as I've never loved before
Since first I met you
on the village green
Come to me
or my dream of love
is over
I love you as I loved you
when you were sweet
when you were sweet
sixteen
"Next week, Philadelphia, then Pittsburgh.
"Feeling fine.
Your loving son, Asa Yoelson."
He's feeling fine.
Philadelphia, Pittsburgh.
Washington was too small for Asa.
- "Indianapolis."
- Indians! He'll come home scalped yet.
"Kickabock."
- Is this in the United States, Papa?
- Don't be foolish!
- No. That's pronounced Di-bi-kah.
- Dubuque!
Anyway, in Dubuque, he sang two encores.
Now spell "tedious."
T-E-D-O...
Wait a minute. That's wrong.
Try again. "Tedious."
You wouldn't know to spell it if you didn't have that book.
I'm not learning. I'm teaching.
By the light
of the silvery moon, moon
I want to spoon
to my honey I'll croon love's tune
Honey moon
keep a-shinin' in June
Your silv'ry beams will bring love dreams
We'll be cuddling soon
by the silvery moon
Just a minute.
How come suddenly in the middle of the song... you put in a "moo-moo"?
I thought it would be a little better that way.
You thought it would be a little better?
If the guy who wrote the song wanted to say "moo-moo"... he'd write it that way.
I just get tired of singing it the same way every time.
- So you thought up "moo-moo"?
- I didn't think it. It just came out.
It just came out?
Don't let it come out!
Sing that song just like it's written... and I don't want to hear no more "moo-moos."
- Yes, sir.
- How do you like that?
He gets tired singing it the same way... so he puts in "moo-moo."
As if that makes any difference.
And another thing... you're singing it a little faster every night.
Is that because you're tired, too?
No. That's because you're playing it too slow.
I'm playing it slow?
Excuse me.
I've only been in this business for 30 years, making a very nice living.
But maybe an old trouper like you ought to come on stage...
I thought of that.
I could sing much better on the stage.
You don't tell me.
Then I can sing right to them instead of the backs of their heads...
- and I could see how their faces look.
- The faces?
Unless you can see the people's faces, it's no good at all.
You don't say. And tell me, Mr. Yoelson... with that spotlight shining right in your eyes...
- how are you gonna see faces?
- That's easy.
If you turn up all the lights in the theater, then they can see me, and I can see them.
Asa in long pants.
Goodbye, my bluebell
farewell to you
One last fond look
into your eyes so blue
'Mid campfires gleaming
'mid shot and shell
Goodbye
- You don't wanna be in the act anymore?
- No, Steve.
I'm going home.
Don't be silly.
Your voice is changing, that's all.
In a couple of years, you'll get it back, better than ever.
And listen, the way you pulled that whistle out of the hat... that's showmanship.
Didn't you hear them applaud?
- But it isn't the same.
- What isn't the same?
The act's just as good as it was before.
When you whistle, their faces don't look the same.
Faces again. This kid'll drive me crazy.
Listen, I didn't say you're gonna whistle the rest of your life.
Just for a while.
Look, know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna work up some whistling routines... and you're gonna work on the stage with me.
What do you think of that?
And do you know something else?
Then you're gonna get billing.
Yes, sir!
"Meet that scintillating team of artists:
Steve Martin and Asa Yoelson."
Asa Yoelson.
"Now I whistle in the act.
Everyone seems to like it.
"Your loving son..."
- Papa, Asa isn't Asa anymore!
- What?
In Reno, Papa, he's picking up time.
Is time something you can pick up?
This is crazy.
This town they liked so much,
they named it twice.
He says he can't come home this summer.
Maybe next spring.
Since first I met you
on the village green
- Listen.
- What's the matter?
Come to me
for my dream of love
is all
I love you as I loved you
When you were sweet
When you were sweet
sixteen
What do you think?
Are we going into this again in the middle of the night?
- It's getting better every time.
- All right, it's getting better.
I told you, let it alone. Give yourself time.
- Go away. Go sing in the bathroom.
- Why not let me try?
You mean all of a sudden, tomorrow maybe...
- in the middle of the act, you wanna sing?
- Why not?
- You're daffy.
- Why?
We're changing no act in the middle of the season... and fall flat on our face.
We're gonna do like I said.
We're gonna knock off a month next spring.
Won't take no. Never stops.
This guy'll drive me crazy.
He's getting close to home.
We'll see him soon, Papa.
- Hello, Pop. How's tricks?
- Letter for you.
Mama. Always on time.
- Overture!
- Come on, Al.
Mama's excited.
Three more weeks, and we go home.
- I could use a nice month's rest.
- Not a month.
I don't want to stay home that long.
Just a few days.
We have to work on the new act and the stuff I'll sing.
I know. There'll be time.
Take it easy. Just relax.
- Stop arguing.
- Just humming a little.
When you sing, it means you're getting ideas.
I was thinking of something.
In Nashville and Charleston, the last two dates... why can't I sing just one chorus of Sweet Sixteen?
- No.
- Just to see how it sounds.
Won't matter if I flop.
Just in Charleston, then.
Let me sing it once the last night.
That little Connolly kid is awful sweet on you.
Give her a tumble and get your mind on something else.
- Don't you think of girls?
- I haven't got time.
All I'm asking is just one chance. That's all...
Stop arguing!
I bet the Kentucky Derby winner.
I win a snootful!
A snootful is right. You better get ready.
I got ready, boy, and I win!
Get yourself together.
You're on in a little while.
- I'll be there with flying colors.
- He can't go on like that.
We better tell Jonesy to skip the act, and get ready ourselves.
You get made up.
- I gotta try and pull this guy together.
- All right, but hurry up.
There's a big derby crowd out there tonight.
The house is packed. You gotta go on.
I'm raring to go.
Oscar Hammerstein and Lew Dockstader!
What are they doing here?
Down for the races.
Why did you drag me here when we could've been playing poker?
Anything on a stage, Oscar, and I love it.
I see them all.
- You're on, Mr. Baron.
- Ready.
Anytime you're ready to go, Lew.
Tom, you're all right? Where's Al?
He was with you, wasn't he?
Where did he go?
All right, Tom.
Tom, come on, get out there. Hurry up!
There's a little bunch of sweetness
that I long to call my bride
And believe me, I'm not happy
But, baby
Funny thing,
I've sung this song a thousand times...
Why I forgot it tonight, I don't know.
You'll hear me call her name
I got it now.
Rosie, you are my posie
You are my heart's bouquet
Come out here in the moonlight
There's something sweet love, I want to say
Your honey boy, I'm waiting
Those ruby lips to greet
Don't be so aggravating
Baron's developed a very nice style.
Very nice.
Rosie
you are my posie
You are my heart's bouquet
Come out here in the moonlight
there's something sweet love
I'm gonna sing about my baby, your honey
Your boy, I'm waiting
Those ruby, those lips to greet
Don't be so aggravating
My blushin' Rosie
my posie sweet!
Did you hear that finish?
Come on, Tom. Get out there!
I don't know any more of Tom's songs.
Take a bow and collapse.
Get yourself off! Go on!
- What's the matter?
- He's sick.
- Let me help you.
- I'll take him back.
Jimmy, get the adagio team. Hurry up!
I'll murder you!
Give me that key to Baron's room.
He could get thrown out.
But the way I sang that finish.
Give me that key.
We gotta get Tom on his feet.
Get that make up off and you get yours on.
The stage manager will be here to see if you died.
- I gotta go on!
- Get this through your head.
You've been on. You just came off.
- You got sick and quit after the first song.
- I did?
Don't you understand?
You weren't on at all. You couldn't make it.
- That idiot went on and sang for you.
- You were a big hit, Tom.
I'll talk to you later. Get that makeup off.
He's all right, Jonesy.
Nothing to worry about.
Mr. Hammerstein and Mr. Dockstader are here to see him.
Hammerstein? Dockstader?
- What's the matter? Let me in!
- Just a minute!
Are you all right?
Did you hear what I told you?
- See, you were a big hit.
- Keep still.
Come in, gentlemen.
He's feeling much better.
Just a little indigestion.
Mr. Baron, gentlemen.
Mr. Dockstader, Mr. Hammerstein.
I'm glad to know you.
You were great out there tonight.
- Sorry you couldn't do more.
- Thank you, Mr. Hammerstein.
This is Steve Martin, gentlemen.
How are you? My partner, Al Jolson.
- How do you do?
- Martin and Jolson.
I have an idea you might do very well at Hammerstein's Victoria... if you'd consider opening in two weeks?
I don't know, Mr. Hammerstein.
That's wonderful. He gets an offer to play on Broadway and he doesn't know.
That's a great break.
I don't carry a contract around with me, but anything will do.
- I'd like to talk to you.
- Who me?
Outside.
I'm certain we won't have any trouble about the terms.
Yes, sir, you're going to enjoy playing my theater.
What did you say your name was?
Al Jolson.
- Did you ever sing in blackface?
- Him? Never.
You see, he just whistles, Mr. Dockstader.
Blacks up behind the ears to whistle.
I've seen Baron work before.
Hammerstein hasn't.
- I'll go and explain to Mr. Hammerstein.
- I wouldn't.
Hammerstein knows what he's doing.
I don't tell tales.
As for you, Jolson... you can join Dockstader's Minstrels in St. Louis next week.
You don't mean it.
- You hear that?
- That's from heaven!
St. Louis next week.
We'd have to leave the show on Saturday.
We can fix that, can't we?
Sure. There's a lot of new stuff we're planning to put in the act.
- We'll have it ready Saturday.
- I can't use an act.
I only have a place for one man.
You mean you just want me?
What did you think?
What would I be doing with minstrels?
Steve and I have been together a long time and we're working up a lot of new ideas.
Not me. You.
But this is what a guy like you prays for.
- Dockstader's Minstrels in one jump.
- Where you can sing your head off.
You mean the job calls for a singer?
What are you talking about?
What did you think?
Then I wouldn't be interested.
See, I like whistling.
Steve and I argue about that all the time.
He wants me to sing... but at heart I'm a whistler.
It makes me happy.
- Martin and Jolson, five minutes.
- That's us.
Thanks a lot.
If you need a whistler, let me know.
Be with you in a minute, Steve.
When are you leaving town, Mr. Dockstader?
Tomorrow evening.
I might drop around to your hotel in the morning.
I wonder what the porter did with my bags. They're not here.
- Must be on the train somewhere.
- I'll see.
Hello, Jolson.
Hello, Mr. Dockstader.
I thought you were going to St. Louis.
I am. So are you.
- All aboard!
- Where's Steve?
He's not coming.
- Then I'm on the wrong train.
- No, you're not! This is the right train.
Steve wants you to go with me.
- I can't do it, Mr. Dockstader.
- But you're throwing away a great chance.
I want a girl
Just like the girl
That married dear old Dad
She was a pearl
And the only girl
That Daddy ever had
A good old-fashioned girl with heart so true
One who loves nobody else but you
And that's why I want a girl
Just like the girl
That married dear old Dad
Excuse me, Mr. Dockstader.
- It's been almost a year now...
- And you're doing fine.
You're making real progress and I have some ideas for you.
I'm going to move you into a quartet.
Thanks a lot, Mr. Dockstader, but you see, I had some ideas myself...
Steve Martin said you break out with a rash now and then.
Ideas about what?
I wanted to talk to you about the kind of song we're singing.
- Same one always in the same way...
- That's what they come to hear.
- It's tradition.
- But they might like something different.
My boy, minstrels have been doing fine for 50 years.
We take pride in doing it like it's always been done.
- I know that...
- But you've got a great point there.
We'll talk it over sometime.
She was a pearl and the only girl
That Daddy ever had
A good old-fashioned girl with heart so true
One who loves nobody else but you
Excuse me, Mr. Dockstader.
- I've been looking for a chance for weeks...
- I agree.
You've worked in that quartet long enough.
Time you moved up.
- I'm going to give you a chance in a duet.
- That'd be fine, Mr. Dockstader... but the point is, if I do,
I'd like to try a different kind of song.
I mean something with a style that's better for me... faster tempo, more rhythm.
I'd like to look for something like that.
Sure. Talk to you about that again.
Must be some song around you'd be happy with.
I want a girl, just like the girl
That married dear old Dad
She was a pearl and the only girl
That Daddy ever had
- Where you going to eat?
- I think I'll take a look at the town.
- I've never been in New Orleans before.
- Don't get lost. We've got a show tonight.
Mr. Dockstader,
Jolson hasn't showed up yet.
It's too late now anyway. Cut the duet.
I'm sorry I'm late...
It's intermission.
We had to skip your number.
I'm very sorry.
I just forgot.
I know that sounds crazy, but I heard some music tonight... something they call "jazz."
Some fellas just make it up as they go along. They pick it out of the air.
They tell me they play it for weddings, funerals...
Funerals?
Don't get the wrong idea.
You've never heard anything like this.
I sang with them. Nothing with words, because the song doesn't have any.
In fact, it isn't even a song.
But you can make it one and get words to fit.
It just needs to be worked on a little.
It's exciting.
It'll make the show a hundred times better.
I'm happy with the show as it is.
But you aren't, are you?
In fact, you never will be.
You'll always be chasing something up ahead... and keep forgetting your act in a little thing like a minstrel show.
So, maybe, we ought to call it quits.
Don't you think so?
Yeah, I think you're right.
Good luck, Jolson.
I hope you find what you are looking for.
Thanks, Mr. Dockstader.
Papa, you're not going to start again tonight?
Can't a man ask himself questions?
In six months, three cards.
I would really like to understand.
He leaves Dockstader and then no cards. Why?
Because he did not leave Dockstader for a better position... because, for a long time, he isn't working.
Excuse me, are you the Yoelsons who have a talented son in show business?
Yup, it's the right Yoelsons.
Mama, you got younger.
- Why didn't you say you were coming?
- Isn't this better?
- This way Mama's having a good cry.
- How are you?
- Look at him, a man.
- Did you eat, Asa?
- Eat? What's that?
- Mama, he didn't eat!
Come on, sit down. Papa and I just finished, but there's plenty. I got everything.
I got to tell Ann!
Sit down. Make him sit down, Papa.
Ann Murray!
Why is she so excited?
What's there to be so excited about?
Mama takes all the medals.
Still the best cook in the United States.
After what you've been eating, by comparison I'm wonderful.
Look at him. Shows you what you can tell from pictures. He is skin and bones.
You see...
That's nice, to put a cap on when you eat.
But, Asa... did you wear one all the time you were away?
- As a matter of fact, I didn't.
- For me, it's not necessary.
- Gefilte fish I made this morning.
- And horseradish, fresh-grated an hour ago.
Look out for it, Asa. It's very strong.
Who's that again? Not Ann Murray?
Of course. She grew up.
And look how pretty.
That's what I mean. It can't be.
She was just a funny little girl with funny ribbons in her hair.
Listen to that, Mama.
And you were such a prize, I suppose?
- Asa was a beautiful boy.
- You see?
- Let him eat. The fish.
- I can taste this already.
- Not too much horseradish.
- I don't have to worry about...
Magnificent.
See? I knew he would like it.
Wonderful, Mama.
Really, the best you ever made.
Mama, you're terrific.
- Tell me, Papa, how's everybody been?
- Mama and I have been well.
By the way, do you know who came to see us a few weeks ago? Steve Martin.
- How is he?
- I don't know.
He didn't look so well.
He said he was picking up time.
- Is that good?
- Lf you don't have a regular booking... that means you're picking up whatever work you can get.
- And you...
- Papa, please, he's eating.
- You can talk business later.
- I'm sorry.
It's all right, Mama.
It's true. I've been picking up a little time now and then.
- You see...
- But wait.
I'd have had regular booking if I'd wanted it. But I've had other ideas.
They sound a little crazy to anyone but me.
Like what, Asa?
Like spending most of my time in hotel rooms with songwriters... whenever I met up with one... trying to make songs out of music
I picked up.
Music nobody ever heard of before, but the only kind I want to sing.
Is this music so peculiar?
You sing it all the time, Papa.
- You want to sing prayers on the stage?
- No, just the feeling in prayers.
That's what's in the people I got it from... and that's what's in their music, even when it's fast and happy.
But they tell me it won't go, Papa.
It's never been done.
In fact, I'll tell you a secret.
They say your son's a little crazy.
Mama, our son is a little crazy.
But what can we do? He is our boy.
We have got to love him.
But about crazy people, Asa... it's very funny.
See, once they prove they are right, they are suddenly great people.
I'll go. Eat, Asa.
Hello. Yes?
New York?
Hello. Yes?
Who?
Al?
Asa? He is right here.
Yes, and who is this, please?
Baron?
A Mr. Tom Baron.
Hello, Tom? How are you?
Where'd you drop from?
How'd you know I was here?
I got your home address from an agency.
It's about this, Al.
You remember that contract with Hammerstein?
I was so bad that he paid me off if I'd stop singing.
That's how it happens I'm managing the new Winter Garden Theatre.
I got you to thank for the whole thing.
Look, my friend, we open in three weeks.
There's a spot in the show for you, if you want it.
If I want it?
Winter Garden?
Yes, I heard you, Tom. It's just a spot... but Broadway.
Except, tell me, Tom, what do I do?
- I mean, exactly what do I sing?
- I don't know.
Any one of the songs that's been written for the show.
Why can't I pick my own, Tom?
Not exactly my own.
It's stuff I picked up. Terrific songs.
They need to be polished up by someone good. Won't take much time.
They're terrific, but not written yet?
What's the good, if it won't help the show and I can't do what I can?
I don't care if it's the biggest show,
I rather pass it up.
Let me bring the stuff on and help me get it into shape.
You will? You're marvelous.
I can leave right away.
I'll be on that train in an hour.
- He just came home.
- Right, Tom, the minute I get there.
- Asa, you are leaving?
- Just right next door, New York. I'll be back.
Honey, what a break this is.
New York, Broadway,
Winter Garden, here I come.
How do you like that?
It's got to be his own song...
- and his own way of singing it.
- Hasn't changed a day.
Thanks a lot.
Don't tell him I had anything to do with it.
This could turn out to be a pack of trouble.
Al? Trouble? I can't imagine what you mean.
Show's running too long.
It's almost 11:00 p.m.
- Who's on next?
- Jolson.
- Cut him and jump to the finish.
- Wait a minute.
Tell the orchestra leader about it.
Look, I want to go on.
Where's Baron? Ask Tom.
Baron isn't running this end of it. I am.
- Hold it. You're not on.
- That's what you think.
We're cutting the Jolson number.
I'm next, folks.
- You lucky people.
- But he's here, in front of me.
Oscar, what are you doing with that phone?
This is no time to call up women.
- I can't get up there and pull him off.
- Close the curtains on him.
Oscar, if you insist on phoning, get one for me.
Hello, Oscar, remember me? Jolson.
Now, boys, take it easy.
Next they'll turn out the lights on me, but I wouldn't mind that.
Professor, my song, if you please.
Settle back, folks.
You ain't heard nothing yet.
Everything seems lovely
when you start to roam
The birds are singing the day that you stray
But wait until you are further away
Things won't be so lovely
When you're all alone
Here's what you'll keep saying
when you're far from home
Mammy
Mammy
The sun shines east, the sun shines west
I know where the sun shines best
Mammy
My little mammy
My heartstrings
are tangled around Alabamy
I'm a-comin'
Sorry that I made you wait
I'm a-comin'
Hope and trust that I'm not late
Mammy
My little mammy
I'd walk a million miles
For one of your smiles
My mammy
Mammy
My little mammy
The sun shines east, the sun shines west
I know where the sun shines best
It's on my mammy I'm talking about
Nobody else's, my little mammy
My heartstrings are tangled around
Alabamy
Mammy
Mammy, I'm comin'
I hope I didn't make you wait
Mammy, I'm coming
I hope I'm not late
Mammy, look at me
Don't you know me? I'm your little baby
I'd walk a million miles
for one of your smiles
My mammy
Asa smashed something?
That actor you wanted to interview for the new show...
- want to see him now?
- Send him in.
Hello, Steve. Haven't seen you in a long time. How have you been?
Fine. Glad to see you, Al.
Sit down. Just cleaning up.
Look, about this part, Al.
It's nice of you to think of me, but it might not be right.
- I'm considering a few other things...
- Sure, I realize that.
But it's like this. I've clicked on Broadway and things are piling up on me.
Music contracts, record-making, sheet music.
Now we're putting together a new show starring Al.
It's a great show.
You should hear the songs.
- We go into rehearsal next week.
- But what's this got to do with the part?
I'm telling you the part.
I need a man who knows show business.
I need a man to move in and help me run my career.
I need a manager. What do you say?
It's a nice part, Mr. Jolson, but not in my line.
You old dog, you got to do it.
I need you, been looking all over for you.
Quit kidding. You got Tom.
I have to run the shows.
Somebody's got to run Al.
- Come on, say you'll ride along with me.
- At my age, ride on a comet?
Tom, meet my new manager,
Mr. Steve Martin.
Great pleasure, Mr. Martin.
Great pleasure, Mr. Martin.
And I'm sittin' on top of the world
I'm rollin' along
Just rollin' along
Don't want any millions
I'm getting my share
I've only got one suit
just one, that's all I can wear
A bundle of money don't make me feel gay
A sweet little honey
is making me say
I'm sittin', sittin' on top
Top of the world
I'm rollin' along
Just rollin' along
And I'm quittin' the blues of the world
I'm singin' a song, just singin' a song
Glory Hallelujah, I just phoned the parson
Hey, Par, get ready to call
Just like Humpty Dumpty
I'm going to fall
And I'm sittin', sittin' on top
Top of the world
I'm rollin' along
Rollin' along
- The show isn't over yet, that's all.
- So what are you worried about?
Mama, when will you learn about show business?
Running time is everything.
You can have a smash show, but if it's too long, it can take a nosedive.
It happens all the time.
What's the matter, Miss Sally?
Just tell your old Uncle Gus everything.
It can't be as bad as all that.
Henry will never believe I love him and not Lester.
Why don't you just explain it to Henry?
He won't even listen to me.
- He won't?
- No.
Honey, Henry better listen pretty soon or this show's going to run till 1:00.
A lot of these folks live in Brooklyn.
They got to catch a train.
He really loves her and she really loves him, and it comes out all right anyway.
Henry, please come here and tell her you love her so we can get to the finale?
Come on, Henry. Come on out.
You remember Henry.
Go ahead, kids, do your stuff.
That's enough. Besides, you're getting paid.
Now that we got that set, take this curtain up.
Has he lost his mind?
Go ahead, take it up.
Hello, kids, how are you?
Wait a minute. Hold it. Don't go.
Don't mind the customers. Do like I tell you.
Everybody, come back and sit down.
Anyway, kids, you're tired... and this may go on for a long time.
Because I got another dozen songs in me and I'm raring to go.
Wait a minute.
I've made up my mind.
If I'm going to sing to you,
I want to see you.
Steve, tell the electricians to turn up the lights.
Go ahead.
All the houselights. Every one of them.
Houselights? Why?
How else you going to see faces?
That's more like it.
I've been waiting for this a long time.
I've been waiting for this a long time.
Professor, You Made Me Love You.
And if that ain't a song cue,
I never heard one.
You made me love you
I didn't wanna do it
I didn't wanna do it
You made me want to
And all the time you knew it
I guess you always knew it
You made me happy sometimes
You made me glad
But there were times, baby
You dog
You made me cry for
I didn't wanna tell you
I didn't wanna tell you
I want some love that's true
You know I do, indeed I do, yes, I do
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
what I cry for
You know you got the kind of kisses
that I'd die for
You know you made me love you
Beginning of the second year and still socko, Mama.
I want to get past those footlights and a lot closer to the audience.
I want a runway from the stage running right down the center of the house.
Then I can sing right at them.
Put a thing like that up, you lose 100 seats every performance.
And your show has twice as long a run, a clear profit.
Look, right down here...
Swanee, how I love you, how I love you
My dear old Swanee
The folks up north will see me no more
when I get to that Swanee shore
I love the old folks at home
Swanee, how I love you, how I love you
My dear old Swanee
The folks up north will see me no more
When I get to that Swanee shore
"Robinson Crusoe, after two years, still sockeroo."
What is "sockeroo," Papa?
Sockeroo, Mama? That's double socko.
Take a big Broadway show like this on tour?
Drag it all over the country into tank towns?
Al's out of his mind. It's never been done.
Neither was lighting up the audience, or runways.
But why this, Steve?
Because it's a brand-new audience, he says, millions of them.
People who never saw a Broadway show and never heard him sing.
But you go ahead, Tom, talk him out of it.
I will.
Here's a laugh.
Some boys at the club were saying,
"Give Sunday night concerts...
"so actors and people in show business can get a chance to see you perform."
How do you like that?
That's the most exciting audience in the world.
That's a great idea.
Make a note of it, Steve.
Tell Tom to arrange it.
Wait. The minute we get back to New York... you want to start to work on the new show, without even a day's rest.
So what?
Soon, you're doing eight performances a week again... like you've done steady for five years.
And now you want to add an extra show on Sunday.
That's a shortcut to the morgue.
Sweetheart, what you like doing keeps you healthy.
I know you'd rather sing to a live face than eat... but I call this winding up with nothing for yourself.
I'm talking about some life outside of a theater.
Like what?
Like slowing down a little and having some other kind of fun... like a family, like some girl.
Don't worry, pal, there's always been a girl.
- Look, when do we play Washington?
- Two weeks.
The night we open there, let's make it a real celebration.
Get a box for Mama and Papa,
Ann Murray and her folks... and tell Papa to bring the president.
- Of the United States?
- No, the synagogue.
Hamburgers
Hamburgers
Hamburgers
List'n to me while I tell you
of the Spaniard who blighted me life
List'n to me while I tell you
of the man who stole my future wife
- 'Twas down at the bullfight we met him
- Yes! Yes!
- And during his daring display
- What then?
And while I went out
for some peanuts and a program
that dirty dog stole her away
- The pig!
- Oh, yes!
Oh, no!
- Oh, yes!
- Oh, no!
So tonight
I will have my revenge
Tonight he will have his revenge
If I catch Alphonso Spugoni
- the toreador
- He'll rue the day
With one mighty swipe
I will dislocate his bally jaw
He will, he will
I'll get him, the blighter, I will
and when I get him, that blighter I'll kill,
he shall die!
- He shall die
- He shall die
- He shall die
- He shall die
- He shall die
- I'll kill him
- He shall die
- I'll kill him dead
I'll raise a bunion on his Spanish onion
If I catch him bending tonight
- He shall die
- He shall die
- He shall die
- He shall die
He shall die
He shall jolly well die
- He shall die
- He shall die
He shall die
Oh, it's too high
One of us should have stayed home
For I'll raise a bunion on his Spanish onion
If I catch him bending tonight
A Spaniard all of sudden.
- Mr. And Mrs. Murray, glad you're here.
- You were great. I enjoyed it.
Mr. Samuels, how are you?
How'd you like it?
When I sing in the synagogue,
I never get applause like that.
Papa, if you want to get ahead singing, you got to have Steve manage your affairs.
Asa, you look thin. You need a rest.
Rest? There's a new show coming up... and now a performance every Sunday night.
- Sunday nights, too?
- By popular request. Don't worry about it.
- AI, it was marvelous.
- I'm glad to see you, Ann.
I know him.
That's Roy Anderson, Al.
He was in school with us.
- Sure, hello, Roy.
- How are you?
We're going to be married next month, Al.
You and Roy?
What do you know!
We've been experimenting with talking pictures for years. We know it'll work.
But we want a star in our first sound picture.
But why Al?
It's logical. He's the biggest singing star and he's led the way ever since he began.
So Al should risk his career on a newfangled invention like this.
- What if this thing is a flop?
- With Jolson, we don't think it will be.
Before Al goes into anything like this, he's gonna knock off for a year and rest.
How many people do you figure see a good movie?
Fifty million in this country alone.
The rest of the world besides.
Never was an audience like that in history.
- That may be true, Al, but...
- It's an audience that never saw a live show.
People in small towns can afford a movie but can't afford anything else.
Audience of millions. Be singing to every one of them at the same time.
- That's really something.
- Ready for the finale, Mr. Jolson.
Stick around, Mr. Glenn.
We'll talk about it later.
Pictures that talk?
- Is that possible, Papa?
- Certainly. It's a new invention.
But tell me, exactly, how does this work?
It's very complicated, Mama.
You wouldn't understand it.
Al, The Jazz Singer is all set. All that's left to do is to make the announcement.
Al, there's your music.
Announcement? There's only one place to make the announcement.
Hi, folks.
Hello, Jerry.
Show people are crazy.
Work in the theater all week.
Sundays, you come here.
I'm crazy, too.
Tonight, folks, I'm only gonna sing
2,000 songs. One to a customer.
I should live so long.
Hold this, will you, Henry?
Sorry I'm late, but we were discussing a business deal in the back of the house.
As a matter of fact,
I'm gonna tell you about it right now.
See, tomorrow I leave for Hollywood.
I'm going into what they call "talking pictures."
Don't know what'll happen to me.
But if I wanna come back, you'll let me, won't you?
Thanks, I'll remember that.
So this is a kind of a farewell.
If you don't mind,
I'll sing till you ask me to stop.
You ain't heard nothing yet.
Well, I see a rival producer sitting down front.
Mr. Ziegfeld.
Ziggy, will you stand up and take a bow?
Try and stop him.
Not too much, folks.
Say, Ziggy, who's that pretty gal with you?
This is Julie Benson, the star of my next production, Show Girl.
Mr. Ziegfeld, you will please not advertise on my time.
Glad to know you, Miss Benson.
Look, I'm giving a little farewell party up at my place tonight, Miss Benson.
I don't live very far from here.
You can bring Mr. Ziegfeld along.
- What'll it be?
- Swanee.
Wait a second. Hold it.
I don't care what you mugs want.
I want to know what Miss Benson would like to hear.
Miss Benson, what is your pleasure?
April Showers.
Let's not keep the lady waiting, Henry.
Though April showers
may come your way
Just for you.
They bring the flowers that bloom in May
So if it's raining
have no regrets
because it isn't raining rain, you know
It's raining violets
And where you see clouds
upon the hills
you soon will see crowds
of daffodils
So keep on looking for a bluebird
And listening for its song
Whenever April showers
come along
Though April showers
may come your way
They bring the flowers
that bloom in May
So if it's raining
have no regrets
because it isn't raining rain, you know
It's raining violets
And where you see clouds
Where you see clouds on the hills
Look, look, they're not clouds, no, no
They're crowds of daffodils
So keep on looking for a bluebird
and listening
for its song
Whenever April showers
come along
Folks, I'm calling the next one.
I want to sing about that big, beautiful state I'm going to.
And I don't mean Florida.
Hit it, Professor!
Hit it, Professor!
California, here I come
Right back where I started from
Where bowers of flowers
bloom in the spring
Each morning at dawning
birdies sing and everything
A sun-kissed miss said, "Don't be late"
That's why I can hardly wait
Open up that Golden Gate
California, here I come
California, here I come, yeah!
Right back where I started from
Where bowers of flowers
bloom in the spring
Each morning at dawning
birdies sing and everything
A sun-kissed miss said, "Don't be late"
That's why I can hardly wait
Come on, open up, open up, open up
that Golden Gate
California
Here I come
California, here I come, yeah!
Right back where I started from
Where bowers of flowers
bloom in the spring
Each morning at dawning
birdies sing and everything
A sun-kissed miss said, "Don't be late"
That's why I can hardly wait
Come on, open up, open up, open up
that Golden Gate
California
here I come
I'm afraid I'll have to talk to you, my friend.
- Please, Mr. Jolson, I'll never do it again.
- You sure?
A million imitators of Al Jolson, but none of them touch the original.
That's a cute speech.
You know, I'd sort of like to touch you.
I don't know. It's funny.
I can't seem to make it.
That's good.
You know, you get prettier every time I see you.
- The first time was just a few hours ago.
- Yeah?
- Then you got prettier since then.
- Thank you.
- Look, will you do me a big favor?
- What?
Will you marry me, Miss Benson?
I'll do you a bigger favor, Mr. Jolson.
I won't marry you.
I didn't suppose you would, but you could think about it.
You'd have to decide tonight.
I'm going to California tomorrow.
- This last evening belongs to your friends.
- Wait. You mean in there?
Tell you a secret, don't even know most of them.
How'd they get there?
It always seems to happen.
You see, I ask a few people up.
Then they ask some people
I never heard of... and those strangers ask some other strangers and before you know it...
- You're singing for them.
- Yeah, just for three or four hours.
You work till midnight and then you come home and work three or four hours more?
I don't mind.
- You mean you love it.
- Yeah, I guess I do.
It's more than just singing.
I don't know how to tell you...
- You really don't have to, Mr. Jolson.
- Yes, I do.
I gotta tell you everything.
- AI, it's getting late and the gang wants...
- Go away, Steve, I'm busy.
Caught a cold. Can't sing a note. Go away.
You really ought to go in, Mr. Jolson.
No, I've got to tell you how I feel.
And it's gonna take me hours.
I shouldn't be rushing you like this.
You'll think I'm kidding.
But look, you see, I've been waiting for something for a long time.
I didn't know what it was.
Steve was trying to tell me, it was about...
All about getting everything and nothing out of life.
I didn't know what he was talking about, and then I saw you.
Yes, sir, then I saw you.
Look, got a great idea.
Suppose you and I got married and went to California together? How about it?
Of course, I'm rehearsing Show Girl, and we open in two weeks.
Yeah, that's too bad.
If it just wasn't for that?
And a few other things.
Go ahead, tell me.
That's what I want to know. Like what?
That street down there.
Broadway? What a street.
You know something, baby?
It belongs to me.
You know something else?
If you want it, I'll give it to you.
That's the point. It's yours all right.
It's your whole life, too.
But I don't think it'll ever be mine.
Why, it's gonna say "Julie Benson" down there in great big lights.
- Do you mean to say you don't want that?
- Yes, I want that.
- I'm just normal enough to want that.
- Sure. You're just a little scared now.
When you get some confidence you'll begin to love it... begin to feel it in your blood.
- That's the big difference.
- What's the big difference?
It was in your blood when you were born.
But I'm just a pretty good hoofer, and I got a lucky break.
All I know is, I want a lot besides this.
Like what, Julie? Gotta know.
Well, in the first place, like a real home.
Sure, everybody wants a home.
- You won't care for the kind I'm thinking of.
- Why not? Why wouldn't I?
It would have to be far enough away.
Maybe way out in the country, so that by the time you got there... and closed the door, you'd have forgotten all about show business.
It's funny, all of a sudden that's what
I've always wanted, to close a door.
I'll tell you something. I know the spot.
It's in Westchester.
Acres of pretty land, trees all around.
Go away, Steve.
Feeling worse all the time. Go away.
- Tell Ziggy I'll see Miss Benson home.
- It's getting pretty late, Mr. Jolson.
Late? But, baby, I'm going away tomorrow.
We're just getting places.
Come here, sit down.
Look, can you cut out that "Mr. Jolson"?
Why don't you just call me by my southern name: Honey.
I know what's the trouble.
You don't believe me.
You don't believe I want anything different.
I'm trying to tell you, I was barging through this big, beautiful world like a fool.
I do believe you, honey.
I always thought I'd like to fall in love with the man I'll marry.
You're absolutely right, and I'm not gonna rush you, baby.
In fact, we won't get married till I get back from California. How's that?
Hello, darling. How are you?
How'd the dress rehearsal go?
Fine, Al. Yes, honest.
But opening tomorrow night will be something else again.
I'm scared to death.
You got nothing to be scared about, honey.
You're gonna be wonderful.
Yeah, I'm still at the studio, working hard.
We shoot pretty soon.
It's gonna be all right, I think, when
I find out which end of the camera's which.
Get a good night's sleep and don't worry, you hear? You're gonna knock them dead.
Yeah, I'll call you again tomorrow night.
Goodbye, angel.
- She all right?
- She says she's scared. She sounds it.
Steve, if I got a plane, a special plane to fly right through...
I can be in New York for that opening tomorrow night.
- What can you do in New York?
- I don't know.
I want to be there. Get on that phone.
Get the plane.
- You can't walk out on the studio.
- Be back soon and work twice as hard.
Phone Ziegfeld, tell him to hold me a seat and not to tell Julie I'm coming.
... is rewarded when the world
will become aware
that Liza
is the fairest
of the fair
Liza, Liza, skies are gray
But if you'll smile on me
all the clouds will roll away
Liza, Liza
don't delay
Come, keep me company
and the clouds will roll away
I just made a date with Parson Brown
Liza, Liza
name the day
When you belong to me
all the clouds will roll away
Liza, Liza, skies are gray
But if you'll smile on me
all the clouds will roll away
Liza, Liza
don't delay
Come, keep me company
and the clouds will roll away
See the honey moon a-shinin' down
I just made a date with Parson Brown
Liza, Liza, name the day
When you belong to me
all the clouds will roll away
- Hello, baby.
- Hello, honey.
Hello? Who?
Al, how are you? Tell me, how'd it go?
What? I can't hear you.
Connecticut?
What are you doing in Connecticut?
You what?
- Meet Mrs. Jolson.
- Oh, my.
- Asa!
- I'm so happy, dear.
Mama, please. Please, give me a chance.
I don't understand. Married a few hours, he runs to California...
It'll take me a couple of months to make this picture, then I'll be home.
And that's where he's gonna stay.
Asa staying home. That will be a miracle.
Julie, there's only one thing the matter with Asa.
He's got to sing. It's a wonderful thing.
Success is beautiful.
But Mama and I have worried... because a home with love in it is even better.
The way you say that is a little corny, Papa, but you're right. Julie agrees with you.
What do you think we'll do?
We'll build a real home and settle down... out in the country where it's nice and quiet, with crickets and frogs.
I'll teach the frogs to sing Mammy, so Al won't be lonely.
Thank you, honey.
- Asa, are you serious?
- Sure.
In fact, Julie doesn't know this yet.
I've got an architect at work.
I told him, "Build a house for Julie.
The sky's the limit."
- That I approve of.
- So do I.
Here. Here have some gefilte fish with the horseradish, Julie.
Look out for the horseradish.
That stuff will curl your hair.
I think we'll have a barn, Mama, and some cows.
- I'm gonna milk them myself.
- You?
- You, milk cows, Asa?
- You have to get up at 5:00 a.m.
We'll keep the cows up at night so they'll sleep later in the morning.
Julie, you got too much.
There's a rainbow around my shoulder
and a sky of blue above
Oh, the sun shines bright,
the world's all right
'cause I'm in love
There's a rainbow around my shoulder
and it fits me like a glove
Let it blow and storm
I'll be warm 'cause I'm in love
Hallelujah, how the folks will stare
when they see that great big solitaire
Let Jolson sing it, mister.
He's doing all right.
Think so?
Yes, sir
There's a rainbow around my shoulder
and a sky of blue above
And I'm shouting so the world will know
that I'm in love
"Jazz Singer marks the end of silent pictures."
"First talking picture sensation."
I have followed show business for many years... but I must say,
I have never seen a thing like this.
- My expert.
- I haven't seen anything like it either.
- It's almost 3:00. Where's Asa?
- You know what a half-hour business talk is.
- You go to sleep. Tom and I'll wait for them.
- Who can sleep on a night like this?
Hello, everybody.
We didn't realize how late it was.
- Did you see the papers?
- We saw them at Glenn's office.
- They're really something.
- "Something," he says.
I'm sorry, baby,
I wanted to celebrate tonight... but we got to talking over...
I know, they want you to go right back to the Coast to make another picture.
- How did you know?
- That was tough to figure out.
They said the first talking picture will be a great hit.
- It ought to be followed with another one.
- You ought to go.
The point is I'd have to go alone. You can't leave your show in the middle of a run.
We'll just have to wait a little while longer.
What happens to the new Winter Garden show?
- That waits like Julie does.
- We'll talk about that later.
Wait a minute, Julie will be here,
Asa in California... so where will you build your house?
In Kansas City?
Don't worry, Mama, we'll build it.
You're terrific to take it this way.
Another bad break, but it won't be for long.
Then you'll get everything you want, angel.
In fact, while I'm gone you go ahead with the house.
Get it ready. Start building it. Start teaching those frogs how to sing Mammy.
Yes, we're closing Saturday. It's definite.
I want you to fly here when you're through.
You were coming east when you're through.
A little change in plans, baby.
A big surprise.
But, Al...
Be on that plane no later than Sunday.
I'm dying to see you.
California, here I come.
Here we are, baby, home.
This is really something.
- How are you, Henry?
- Meet Mrs. Jolson.
Great to have her here, isn't it?
Here, baby, let me take this.
You want something? You want to clean up, want something to eat?
- Henry will rustle up some grub.
- I don't want a thing.
Come on, let's go inside then.
Come on, fellas.
It's been a long time, honey.
Here, wait a minute, let me look at you.
- Never gonna let you out of my sight again.
- Good for you.
Sit down, Dick. This may take a little time.
- It's a little large, isn't it?
- It ain't exactly small.
You see, they used to play football here before they built the Coliseum.
You wouldn't care for a place like this, but don't let it get you down.
Darling, since we don't have to stay here very long, I just love it.
Yeah, that's right.
Yet, on the other hand, baby, you know...
Come here. Sit down.
Got something to tell you.
On the other hand, what?
On the other hand, he's talking through his hat.
We had a little dinner planned.
Forget what we arranged.
I can't wait, gotta tell her now.
What goes on here?
Honey, talking pictures are here for good.
They're getting better all the time.
In a few years, they'll have audiences nobody ever dreamed of.
Studio's got terrific plans.
All I know is a man would have to be insane to walk away from this now.
- AI, you went and did it.
- What?
You bought a house here. Or you're building one with sunken gardens.
- That was the surprise you talked about.
- No, honest.
- You ain't heard nothing yet, Julie.
- You said it.
- Now, baby, now, listen...
- AI, are you gonna sing Mammy?
Quit clowning. Look, you don't think I'd ask you to give up... the stage and dancing and just have you come out here and settle down?
I'd consider it.
I wouldn't let you do that. You're too terrific.
In fact, do you know what pictures need?
Talent, and something beautiful at the same time, like you.
- Wait a minute.
- Listen, show business is here now, baby.
You belong in it, you and me both.
If we're together, who cares where we live?
The world's gotta hear about you.
Your name on billboards in 97 languages.
Greatest star pictures ever had.
You can't miss. The document?
- You didn't forget to bring it?
- Here.
Your studio's about to own the biggest hunk of talent.
Papa's been working on this contract.
It's all ready to sign.
Wait a minute. Julie hasn't said anything.
- I can't think of anything.
- There you are.
Maybe she doesn't want her name in more than 17 languages. Or maybe none.
Don't listen to him. For weeks he's squawking about me rushing you into this.
This guy is out of his mind about pictures.
The latest type of Jolson rocket is taking off.
I've been riding those dizzy things for years.
It's all right with me.
But maybe you had something a little slower in mind.
Baby, what's he talking about?
Haven't the faintest idea.
My dear Mr. Martin, pictures need talent... and what girl would take 17 languages when she can have 97?
Shall I sign this now, Mr. Jolson?
Thanks, Steve, you talked her into it.
Here you are, baby.
Got a pen, Dick? We'll do this right now.
Call the studio. Mrs. Jolson's ready for her first starring vehicle.
Call the studio. Mrs. Jolson's ready for her first starring vehicle.
She's a Latin from Manhattan
You can tell by her manana
She's a Latin from Manhattan
And not Havana
Though she does the rumba for us
And she calls herself Dolores
She was in a Broadway chorus
known as Suzie Donahue
I can take a tambourine and whack it
But with me it's just a racket
She's a hoofer from Tenth Avenue
I'm a Latin from Manhattan
I'm a Forty-Second Streeter
She's a Latin from Manhattan
Senorita Donahue
- Here's to the real star of this family.
- I'll have a drink to that.
I thought I was pretty good.
- Now to Julie's next picture.
- Wait, let's not even think about it.
Not another one. Not right away.
I couldn't go through all that work again.
You can't stop now. You're up there.
Do another one and prove the first one wasn't a fluke.
You won't mind the next one, you're used to it.
And after the first dozen, you won't mind anything.
Dozen?
My mother said, "Always be kind to tired ladies, especially when they're pretty."
- Is the mob getting you down, babe?
- No, I like people, Steve.
I just wish sometimes there weren't so many of them.
Funny how they never get tired listening to him. Night after night.
Not so funny. He's a pretty remarkable fella.
That he is.
Soon, you and Al will wash up the pictures, and you'll knock off for a long rest.
That'll take a miracle, Steve.
When I'm finished, he's in the middle of one and vice versa.
We'll never come out together.
Then somebody's got to quit for once and wait for the other.
No waits, no delays in the life of the Jolsons.
Just a matter of putting your foot down once.
He'll know the right time, Steve.
He's happy, so am I.
And it's not nice to put your foot down.
Good night, my friend.
Remember those plans you had for that house in the East?
I just happened to think of that the other day.
Find a piece of land in the country around here, in the Valley, for instance... and get the thing built. You'd get a big kick out of that, wouldn't you?
I don't know, Steve.
That was just a romantic idea I once had.
What's wrong with this house?
It's got marble, even.
Good night, Steve. I'm absolutely dead.
I agree with you, baby. No more contracts.
I've told Dick how you feel.
But this last one, this isn't just another one.
This is you and me in the same picture.
It's one thing I've had my heart set on.
When we've done it, we've done everything.
Then we blow this town, do anything you want.
- The script is ready.
- It's good.
- You could shoot in a month.
- A hard month of dance rehearsals.
This will be fun.
Why don't you go away for a year and do this when you come back?
That's no good. Say yes, Julie.
- You can say no, too. You're a citizen.
- Shut up, Steve.
The stars are gonna twinkle and shine
This evening about a quarter to nine
My loving arms
are gonna tenderly twine, tweet, tweet, twine
Around you, around a quarter to nine
I know I won't be late
'cause at half past eight
I'm gonna hurry there
I'll be waiting where the lane begins
Waiting for you on needles and pins
And then the world is gonna be mine
mine, all mine
This evening around a quarter to nine
Good evening.
- How was the picture?
- Wonderful.
- Henry, it was a mild sensation.
- I'm glad.
There's nobody here.
What do you know? A big Jolson preview and no mob waiting at home?
- What do you suppose happened?
- It could be me.
- Could be you?
- I told Henry to tell any callers... that we went straight from the theater to Santa Barbara for the weekend.
- Suppose that did it?
- You're kidding.
Show you how it works. Listen.
Sorry, Mr. And Mrs. Jolson left for Santa Barbara.
That's too bad.
Say we stopped by, will you?
- Good night, Henry.
- Good night.
- Simple.
- Sweetheart, that's cute.
Should have thought of it a long time ago.
- You don't really mind, do you, Al?
- Mind?
You see, tonight's a different night.
The last picture's finished.
We're free. Not a contract in the world.
- The governor sent the pardon.
- That's right.
I thought a quiet evening around the fire, discussing plans for the future.
Look, sandwiches, coffee... and we'll play some records by a fella named Al Jolson, very talented.
That guy's washed up, hasn't even got a picture contract.
- Have some coffee, Steve?
- Thanks, Julie, I will.
Honey, you sound like a gal with a program all figured out.
First we shake this town for points east... maybe farther east than that, across the Atlantic, who knows?
Cream for you, Steve.
And when that's out of our system, there's a little matter of building that house.
That I gotta see if I never see another house in the world.
I kind of got a hankering to see it myself.
I'm glad to hear that, because I can have it up in no time.
I know every room in the place.
I've even got it furnished.
Just one thing... in our travels to find the right place to put that house.
You don't mean the East, do you, baby?
That was the original idea. Why change it?
We've gotten used to this country here.
I like it.
I don't know, it feels more like home than any place in the world... and it doesn't matter too much to you, does it, sweetheart?
No, not really. And if it does to you, Al.
Don't put it that way. There's nothing special you want in the East, is there?
No, that's true. That settles it.
It's going to be here.
- Wonderful!
- And you keep quiet.
Only, Al, we could get out in the country a little way, couldn't we?
- Sure, why not?
- Thanks.
That's all I wanted.
With no number on the house, and some vicious dogs in the yard... you can keep the callers down to practically nothing.
It's Friday. What about train tickets out of here, say, Sunday?
I can be ready tomorrow, but Sunday will have to do.
What's the rush?
Let's give ourselves a little time.
Let's say a week or so.
What do we want with a week or so?
No kidding, a week would wrap up everything fine for me.
- What have you got to wrap up?
- Not a thing.
He just thinks he has.
Nothing important at all.
Have a coffee, Al. It's great.
- Look, boys, is something cooking?
- No, there's nothing cooking.
It was just an idea, that's all.
A proposition about putting a company together and making our own pictures...
Nothing definite, just talking about it.
Of course, in a week or so it could gel.
It might be a pretty exciting thing to come back to. That's all it was.
Sorry, no gelling. First thing you know, you've set a date to make a picture.
Then we'll have to travel with one eye on the calendar or something just as bad:
Talking about a picture all the time we're gone.
- Not a peep. Give you my word.
- Fine, darling.
But I know this is silly, but it's gotten to be a sort of principle.
Once we do say we're going to quit for a while...
- Who said we weren't?
- Then, whatever this proposition is... it'll still be there in three months or six months...
And just as hot, so why bother now?
Why don't you lay off, Al?
What a beating I'm taking here.
But look, honey, remember me?
This is Jolson.
I go with the principle every time, but all I'm talking about is a couple of days.
When you want to spend them that way, Al, that's where the principle is.
It isn't the days.
It doesn't have anything to do with time.
If you can't see that, Al,
I wouldn't know how to...
Holy smoke, this is a kid stunt, isn't it?
I'll be right back.
First time I ever saw Julie cry.
- Something wrong with me, I guess, Steve.
- Yeah, has been for a long time.
You're going to hate to stop work and go away, aren't you?
It's going to be awfully tough, isn't it?
Not singing always is.
And here I am asking you to go away without any plans... without even any work to come back to.
Honest, it doesn't matter that much, baby.
You know how it is when an old fire horse hears the bell.
I didn't say it was your fault.
That's not what I'm trying to say.
What we've got to discuss is you and me.
Please, Al, just listen hard for once, will you?
You see, I'm like somebody with one desperate chance left.
I couldn't go on this way if I wanted to.
That means you'd have to change.
You'd have to get off this merry-go-round and quit for once, for a long time.
And I know you'd make promises and try to keep them.
But I'd know how you felt.
I couldn't have any happiness out of wishing the tiniest misery on you.
Any way you look at it, there's got to be misery for both of us.
And the way we feel about each other, rather than let that die a slow, painful death...
I think we ought to have the courage to quit now.
That's the one thing that can't happen.
- Be honest, Al.
- I never understood a thing.
You've heard of fellas who hit the bottle and wind up hopeless drunks.
Whatever drives me that way and won't let me understand... it's the same thing.
I've been like a fella who's been drunk all his life.
And you know, a guy like that will get so bad... he'll pass up the thing he wants more than anything else.
You don't have to tell me how you feel about me. I know that.
No, listen, baby.
I do have to tell you, because listen...
I've been kicked around in my time.
I thought I could take anything, but your saying you want to quit because...
Look, baby, if it means losing you...
It isn't even a contest.
I don't want any more contracts, or shows, or any singing in the world.
You can't make me a gift of your whole life.
I just couldn't take it.
No, look, baby, it's giving you nothing... except this show business, and that's cheated me all my life.
It stands to cheat me right now because I know what would happen.
I'd go on the same way, working my head off... living everybody's life but my own, and at the same time...
Iose the only thing
I was lucky to get out of it.
I know what you're thinking.
I'm kidding myself and don't know it.
Maybe, yes. I don't know.
When you've been all your life like a drunk... you can't quit all of a sudden.
Sometimes you crave this stuff.
But I am sober now, baby.
And I want you to help me.
If I start yelling, hit me over the head, tie me down.
Because when you go, baby,
I got nothing left.
So, be a pal, Julie. Do what I ask you.
- Hello, Henry.
- Sir, welcome.
Honey, it's a miracle.
Why, it fell from heaven.
You're over the threshold, you fool.
Put me down.
- It's a sensational job, Julie.
- Thank you, boys. Thank you.
Alice, Henry, the house looks beautiful.
You've done a wonderful job.
You've worked hard enough now.
Why don't you take the rest of the day off?
That's right. Go ahead.
- Don't worry about dinner. We'll get a snack.
- Kitchen snack. That's for me.
- Shall I take the bags up now?
- Don't worry. We'll take care of them.
Yeah, so long, Henry. Have a good time.
Checkers.
I used to be a champ back in Washington.
Come on, I'll play you a game.
Checkers, now? You just came in.
How about unpacking?
- We got months to unpack.
- Months.
Wood and everything. I'll light a fire.
We'll play right over here, nice and cozy.
It's not cold enough for a fire.
If he wants to light a fire in his own home, he can.
That's telling him, baby.
Move that lamp off.
We'll bring the table right here.
Steve, get this one out of the way.
- What'll I do with it?
- Put it anyplace.
Get that, will you, Steve?
- Where?
- In the library.
Put it there. Steve, the phone.
Let's take that telephone out, Julie.
Don't be silly. We need a telephone.
Why? People got along without them for thousands of years.
Anybody wants to get in touch with us, let them do it by carrier pigeon.
We've retired, sweetheart.
Come on, sit down.
I'll play you for who's going to be boss in this house.
- It's Dick Glenn, the studio.
- Not here.
- He wants to wish you luck in the new home.
- Tell him thanks.
If the studio has this telephone number, change it.
Your move, baby.
- Big fire, isn't it?
- Yeah, it sure is.
- Want to move this way a little bit, baby?
- All right.
Cozy, Steve?
For a Turkish bath, it's very nice.
- Is it a little warm in here, baby?
- It is, a little.
There's nothing like a five-alarm fire on a nice spring day.
You know,
I never wanted this table in the living room.
It should be in the library.
It's much cozier in there.
- You want to move in there now, honey?
- Yeah, let's.
We'll be with you in a minute, Steve.
Just sit down and relax.
It's your home, too, you know.
New Zealand. Go Into Your Dance was playing there lately. Funny.
Still hearing from places like that after all this time.
It's the fan letters from China I like to read.
- Where's Julie?
- She'll be back.
- For lunch?
- That's what she said.
- Where'd she go?
- Into town. I don't know.
Why didn't she tell me?
I could have gone along for the ride.
Your folks' wedding anniversary tomorrow.
You'll phone them?
- I wish we'd have gone east and celebrated.
- Julie wanted to go, and you said no.
I know. I just didn't feel like it then.
We should've brought the folks to California for their anniversary this year.
We talk about doing it every year, and never do. It would have been nice.
I wish Julie had told me where she was going.
She'll be here in a little while. Look, Al... this manuscript of Baron's new show.
You want to change your mind and read it, or shall I send it back?
I don't know. Better send it back.
- He's wired about it twice.
- Why doesn't he stop wiring?
We've told him 50 times in this last year,
I'm not interested in any shows.
Wait a minute. Tom knows that.
All he wants is your opinion, and any ideas you might have.
Tell him I'm sorry, Steve.
I don't want to read it. Haven't the patience.
- Hello, Al.
- There she is.
Surprise!
- Mama, Papa!
- Asa!
- What a surprise. Who thought of this?
- Steve.
- Julie.
- Mama.
No, Papa.
- Look, he's gonna cry.
- Go away.
A big boy like him.
This is the life.
You know, Mama, if I tried, I could get used to this.
- You go right ahead and try, Papa.
- You and Mama ought to move out here.
Henry, will you see who that is, please?
We've got acres of land.
We'll build you a house right next door.
Next door?
How would Papa get to a synagogue on the Sabbath?
You know, on the Sabbath, you mustn't ride.
It would be a long walk back to Washington, especially two trips a week.
Mr. Baron.
- Hello, everybody.
- Tom, how wonderful to see you.
- Looking fine. Where'd you drop from?
- New York, Steve. How are you?
- Cantor, please sit down.
- Thank you.
- Mrs. Yoelson.
- How do you do, Mr. Baron?
Al, you look wonderful.
- Hello, Tom. When did you arrive?
- Just flew in.
- Had no idea I'd find the whole family here.
- You lost no time finding me.
- That's right...
- You wasted a trip.
You can turn around and go back.
I'm not interested in your show.
Steve's told you that, hasn't he?
- AI, wait a second.
- I've quit. I've worked enough.
For you, too. Busting out here like this'll get you nothing.
Al, what's the matter with you?
You happen to be wrong, Al.
To cast a Broadway show these days... you have to come to Hollywood to find the actors.
I can't imagine coming here and not saying hello to you...
- after quite a few years together.
- Of course.
- You'll have lunch with us, won't you?
- Julie, I'd love to, but as a matter of fact...
As a matter of fact, we wouldn't think of letting you go.
Henry, set Mr. Baron up here.
Move over, Steve.
Come here, Tom, sit down.
Look, pal. Look, everybody.
There was a crazy fella here a minute ago, but I think he's gone now.
You can relax.
- How long are you staying?
- I'm flying back late tomorrow night.
Mama and Papa have the guest room.
There's a studio bed in the library for Tom tonight. With bath.
- What do you say, Mr. Baron?
- No, I really...
That's settled.
And tomorrow night you will attend the wedding anniversary dinner...
- of Cantor and Mrs. Yoelson.
- I wouldn't miss that for anything.
- But about tonight, I've got a hotel room.
- Sorry, you're staying here, my boy.
And look, son, I'm gonna read that little show of yours tomorrow.
Yes, sir, I'm gonna give it Mr. Jolson's personal attention and advice.
And tomorrow night...
What do you say to our having the dinner party here?
- What do you think of that idea, Papa?
- This I could also get used to.
It's gonna be beautiful out there tonight.
It's about time those two stopped talking in there.
- Luck to it, Tom.
- You've been a big help to me, Al.
I got a kick out of working on it.
Like old times. It happens to be good.
If I ever had any idea of going back to the old grind... it's the kind of a show I'd want.
Not that I have any such idea.
Matter of fact, I couldn't stand it.
- What do you mean?
- A show's a big job. You gotta be up to it.
Look at me.
Laying off for a long time like this.
Pipes not what they used to be.
I'll tell you something you never knew.
Every opening night of my life,
I used to have knots right in here.
No, that's all behind me, Tom.
Luck again, pal.
Al hasn't been as excited about anything in a long time, has he, Steve?
I don't know.
- Must be a good show.
- Not bad.
He gave Tom some good ideas this afternoon.
Julie, make him sing tonight.
I'm afraid we won't have any more luck than we had last night.
He'll play records again, but that's all.
Well, I can understand.
He has sung enough.
- Let the records sing for a change.
- Nice idea, Cantor.
Speaking of change, Papa, do you think it's been good for Al?
- Good? How do you mean?
- Does he seem happy to you?
Of course.
- Exactly like he used to be?
- A little more settled, maybe.
After all, it's time. He's no boy anymore.
- Dinner is ready, Mrs. Jolson.
- Good, I'll break this up.
All right, that's all, boys.
Join the party. Dinner's served.
That's that. Washes everything up.
From here in, Mama, we belong to you.
I'm hungry. Let's go.
My dear Cantor, if you'll give your arm to the bride and lead the way.
The Cantor and Mrs. Yoelson are the youngest couple I've ever known.
It doesn't matter how many years they've been married.
All that counts is the spirit.
And I wish them
100 more young years of happiness.
L'Chaim.
- Thank you.
- Speech, Cantor.
Yeah, speech, come on.
- No...
- Come on, Papa.
Thank you, Mr. Martin.
That was very beautiful.
In fact...
That wine was very good, Mama.
I mean, what you said before about the spirit, Mr. Martin.
By a strange coincidence... we actually said something just like that... the night of our wedding, while Mama and I were dancing.
I said, "Let's always dance."
And how we danced that wedding night.
Asa, you should have seen us.
I remember, you couldn't be there.
Anyhow, I thank you all.
That was very good, Papa.
Remember that, Asa?
I've heard you sing it a thousand times, Papa.
That was the waltz at our wedding.
Come on, Asa, sing with me.
No, you go ahead, Papa.
Listen to this.
As a little boy, he used to sing with me at the synagogue.
What's the matter? Too big a man now?
Mama, tell the truth.
Who was always a better singer, me or Asa?
You, of course, Papa.
Do you hear that? Come on.
Please?
How we danced
on the night we were wed
We vowed our true love
though a word wasn't said
The world was in bloom
there were stars in the skies
Except for the few
that were there in your eyes
Dear, as I held you close in my arms
Angels were singing a hymn to your charms
Two hearts gently beating, murmuring low
"Darling, I love you so!"
The night seemed to fade
into blossoming dawn
The sun shone anew
but the dance lingered on
Could we but recall
that sweet moment sublime
We'd find that our love
is unaltered
by time
- That's that.
- Thank you, Asa. That was very nice.
Cantor, you two have a fine dancing act there.
Do you think we could pick up a little time?
I can book you solid for the season.
It was a beautiful party, Julie.
I'd like to take over from here on.
Suppose we drive into town and you all be my guests at a nightclub.
- What do you say?
- Nightclub now?
Yes. We could see an early floor show, and I can catch my plane.
- No, let's not.
- Why?
Well, I haven't been in one of those spots in years.
We're just country folks, Tom.
We don't go for that fast life.
Anyway, Mama and Papa wouldn't be interested in a nightclub.
Yes, we would.
There you are.
And it's not your anniversary, son, it's theirs. Come on, let's go.
In all your years in show business, Papa, you didn't see anything like this yet.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm interrupting
the show to make an announcement.
We have a celebrity with us...
a man you've enjoyed and admired
for many years.
He's been away for a long time,
and we've missed him a lot.
But he still is the greatest entertainer
of them all.
Wonder who he means?
It's an honor to introduce...
That's right, it's Mammy
and the man who made it famous...
the one and only Al Jolson!
The idiot.
There's a slight chance,
if we ask him hard enough...
just for old times' sake,
Mr. Jolson might give us a song.
- This guy's crazy.
- Come on, Al!
Sorry, no.
They're not going to stop.
Better do it and get it over with.
Baby, it looks like
I'm not going to get out of this. I'm sorry.
Thanks, Eddie. Thank you, boys.
That was a big introduction.
Just talk into this?
Thank you, folks.
It's nice to be remembered.
I can't tell you how nice.
But about singing for you,
you see, I'm a little rusty...
but you asked for it,
so we'll just make it a quick one.
- What do the boys handle that I can sing?
- Anything.
Robert E. Lee.
I don't think I'll need this.
Watch them shuffling along
See them shuffling along
Go take your best gal, your real pal
Go down to the levee, I said the levee
join that shuffling throng
Hear that music and song!
It's simply great, mate, waiting on the levee
Waiting for the Robert E. Lee
Watch them shuffling along
See them shuffling along
Go take your best gal, your real pal
Go down to the levee, I said the levee
Join that shuffling throng
Hear that music and song
It's simply great, mate, waiting on the levee
Waiting for the Robert E. Lee
Great.
More!
They'll mob him.
All right.
Come on out, gang. Everybody.
Everybody in the show, come out and sit down.
You work hard every night and must be tired of doing this show.
Just sit down, and I'll take over for you tonight.
Haven't worked in a long time.
Gather around, make yourselves comfortable.
You ain't heard nothing yet.
You pick it, Professor. What'll it be?
Rock-a-bye!
Yes, sir. I think I remember that one.
Rock-a-bye your baby
with a Dixie melody
When you croon, croon a tune
from the heart of Dixie
Hang that cradle, Mammy mine
Right on that Mason-Dixon line
And swing it from Virginia
To Tennessee with all the soul that's in you
Weep No More, My Lady
You see, what he didn't have at home,
Mama, was an audience.
Live faces. Isn't that it, Steve?
And Old Black Joe, just as though
you had me on your knee
A million baby kisses I'll deliver
if you will only sing The Swanee River
Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye baby
with a Dixie melody
Rock-a-bye hush-a-bye
to a Dixie melody
When you croon, croon a tune
from the heart of
You see, Papa,
Al was sure he didn't want to sing anymore.
He wanted to be with me.
- I think I let him make the wrong decision.
- I don't get this, Julie.
I think Papa does.
To Tennessee with all the soul
that's in you, Mammy!
Mammy, listen what they're playing
They're playing Weep No More, My Lady
Sing it for me and Old Black Joe
just as though you had me on your knee!
A million baby kisses I'll deliver
if you will only sing The Swanee River
Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye baby
with a Dixie melody
April Showers!
You heard them, Professor.
Though April showers may come your way
Though April showers may come your way
They bring the flowers
that bloom in May
So if it's raining
have no regrets
because it isn't raining rain, you know
it's raining violets
And where you see clouds
Excuse me.
You soon will see crowds
of daffodils
So keep on looking for a bluebird
- Where do you think you're going?
- Home.
Throw some things in the car.
- I'll be gone by the time he gets back.
- Don't do that, Julie.
He tried awfully hard, Steve...
- but you and I know he's got to do that.
- Now, wait...
See that he's on that plane with Tom tonight. They'll do a great show.
- This is going to kill him, Julie.
- It isn't going to be so good for me, either.
But, look, when did you last see him as happy as that?
Have no regrets
Because it isn't raining rain
you know, it's raining violets
Steve, when he gets home nights after the show... don't let him sing too long.
You soon will see crowds
of daffodils
So keep on looking for a bluebird
And listening for its song
Whenever April showers
come along
I call it a hit.
- What'll your review say?
- Car, sir?
I like it too, so I guess I'll pan it.
That's logical.
My publisher resents Cohan impersonating the president of the United States.
Says our young readers dream of being president.
"I'd rather be right than be president."
Cohan may find out he isn't either one.
I don't see how George does it at his age.
I remember him when he was a little boy.
Congratulations, George, old boy.
You did a great job.
- Thanks. Thanks very much.
- Congratulations.
- You had him down to a tee.
- We're still treading on dangerous ground.
Imitating the president, a lot of people aren't gonna like it.
It's all good, clean fun.
Didn't they enjoy it in Boston?
- Never could do anything wrong in Boston.
- Ha-ha-ha!
Greatest man in the United States played by the greatest actor.
Nothing wrong with that, especially when the greatest actor is my husband.
- This could be treason.
- Don't worry.
I know a dollar-a-year man who'll take care of you.
- A lot would like to shoot actors.
- Save these telegrams.
The government needs paper.
You've got a list like who's who here.
There's everybody but Hirohito.
- We'll bring him in on a shutter.
- Here's mine.
- Won't you read all that cleverness?
- What makes you think I didn't?
I didn't know there was that much love left in the entire Western Union codebook.
- Hold that. Thank you.
- Uh-oh.
- Don't bother me.
- It's from the White House.
- That bothers me.
- Here.
You read it, Sam. These aren't my reading glasses. What's it say?
"George M. Cohan, the Alvin Theater, New York.
The president of the U.S. requests that you call upon him...
...at your earliest convenience in regard to a personal matter.
Kindly reply for definite appointment at White House.
Steven T. Early, secretary to the president."
Hmm.
There you are, Sam.
There you are. What did I tell you?
Coming at a time like this, with everything he has on his mind...
...this is not just a casual invitation.
This is important.
- I think we're in trouble.
- Don't worry.
They don't telegraph you to come and be shot at sunrise.
He doesn't get up that early.
Besides, I've got a run-of-the-play contract.
Fine time to make lame jokes. Hmm.
I'm worried, Sam. I'm really worried.
Halt!
- Yes, sir. What can I do for you?
- I've got an appointment.
- And the name, please?
- Cohan. George M. Cohan.
All right, sir, if you'll wait just one moment, I'll call.
Sergeant Lewis at the Pennsylvania Avenue gate.
- Good evening, Mr. Cohan.
- Good evening.
- We've been expecting you.
- Thank you.
Why, your coat's wet.
Didn't you come in the car?
No, I walked up from the station.
Washington's a great town to walk in.
I always get a kick out of it.
Yes, indeed.
Won't you come with me?
I was supposed to be off-duty this evening, Mr. Cohan...
...but when I heard you was coming,
I thought...
...I would like to see if you looked the same.
That depends just on when you saw me last.
Well, it must have been
30-some years ago.
I was valet for Mr. Teddy Roosevelt.
He got me a seat up in the gallery.
The play was George Washington, Jr.
And you was just singing and dancing all about the grand old flag.
Mr. Teddy used to sing it in his bathtub.
- It was a good old song in its day.
- Yes, sir, it was...
...and it's just as good today as it ever was.
Come in.
Well, hello there.
- How's my double?
- Your double isn't any too sure.
Give me time to work on that one.
Why, I was told you knew all the answers.
There was a time when I thought so.
Right now, I wish I did.
Yes, so do I. Sit down, Mr. Cohan.
Thanks.
- You know, I'm a little bit nervous.
- Heh-heh-heh.
I'm sorry I missed the opening of your show.
Maybe just as well.
Don't worry about it.
We understand each other perfectly.
- I think so.
- The Herald Tribune says...
...that you make a better president and I'd rather be right than I am.
Don't forget, that's a Republican newspaper.
I can remember you and your family very well. The Four Cohans.
Do you, really, Mr. President?
That's a long time ago.
Yes. It was while I was attending school near Boston.
I was a pretty cocky kid those days.
Pretty cocky kid.
A regular Yankee Doodle Dandy.
Always carrying a flag in a parade or following one.
- I hope you haven't outgrown the habit.
- Not a chance.
That's one thing I always admired about you Irish-Americans.
You carry your love of country like a flag, right out in the open.
It's a great quality.
I inherited that, got that from my father.
He ran away to the Civil War when he was 13.
Proudest kid in the state of Massachusetts.
So you've spent your life telling the other 47 states...
...what a great country it is.
I never thought of it just that way before...
...but I guess that's about the size of it.
And I lost no time, either.
It started with a very funny incident, about 60 years ago.
It was in Providence, Rhode Island, on the Fourth of July.
There weren't so many stars then, in the flag or on the stage...
...but folks knew that more were coming.
They were optimistic, happy and expectant.
The beginning of the
Horatio Alger Age.
My father was playing in a variety, breaking in a single.
Nobody was more expectant than he was...
...unless it was my mother.
She was busy right then on a smaller production.
Larry O'Leary is me name
By trade I am a dancing master
There's no one can teach the same
Nor teach it any faster
It's easy, very easy
If you watch every twist, every turn
Keep your eyes upon me
And surprised you will be
At the dancing you have yet to learn
Keep your eyes upon me
And surprised you will be
At the dancing you have yet to learn
- Any messages come for me?
- Not yet.
- Better take a bow, Jerry.
- Can't. I gotta leave.
- Watch that water!
- Max, I gotta leave.
- I gotta find out what's happening.
- Oh, for heaven's sake, Jerry.
Take up Number 3.
You're on. Go ahead. Light's up.
- Bye, Sally.
- Good luck.
You can't run through the streets in that outfit.
- They'll put you in jail.
- Have to catch me first.
Don't forget, Jerry, you're on again at 4:15.
- Don't worry. I'll be back.
- These things take hours sometimes.
My wife never held up a show in her life.
Excuse me, can I get through here?
The Irish are at the head of the parade.
- I'm not in the parade. I want to get through.
- Not a chance, brother.
You don't say so.
We'll get you there in a jiffy!
Here, this'll give you courage. Charge!
Nellie.
Nellie.
- Is she all right?
- She's doing fine.
- What is it?
- Well, all signs point to its being a boy.
Wait. He just got here and he's sleeping already.
All babies sleep 20 hours a day, Jerry.
That's why most of them never amount to anything.
- What'll we call him?
- Oh, I don't know.
- What do you say?
- Well, seeing that he arrived...
...on the Fourth of July, what about George Washington Cohan?
Well, it has a nice patriotic ring to it.
What do you think?
Oh, the George is fine, but the Washington...
...may be too long for a billboard.
Well, how about a nice short Irish name?
Dennis or Michael?
George Michael Cohan. Heh.
Yes, I like that name.
Oh, gosh. I forgot.
Hey! It's a boy!
Oh, Jerry.
Heavenly day, Nellie!
He's crying with a brogue.
The first thing I ever had my fist on was the American flag.
I hitched my wagon to 38 stars and 13 stripes.
I was 6 or 7 years old before I realized they weren't celebrating my birthday...
...on the Fourth of July.
Then my folks had a real break...
...when my little sister Josie made her entrance.
She grew to love show business...
...just as she loved everybody and everything.
We toured the kerosene circuit in a tank show...
...called Daniel Boone on the Trail.
Everybody doubled in brass.
Dad walloped the bass drum.
For some reason, they teamed me with a donkey.
I was a good Democrat even in those days.
Mother and Josie threw out handbills.
Their smiles would've sold tickets to wooden Indians.
They kept putting new stars on the flag...
...and the Cohans kept rushing out to meet them.
We had jokes to match every cornfield.
We sang at every milk station.

I was taken by surprise
By a pair of roguish eyes
While strolling through the park one day
We trouped through depression and inflation, the country's growing pains.
Froze in winter and roasted in summer.
But it was a good life.
It's a lucky family that dances together every day.
1891 found our fortunes flat as a pancake.
Then came a bolt from the blue, jobs for the whole family...
...in a show called Peck's Bad Boy.
We opened in Brooklyn. Heh-heh-heh.
The town was known for its spirited audiences even before it had a ball team.
Who keeps hammering on our opening night?
- What are you doing here?
- I'm the star, ain't I?
You have the leading part, yes.
That means I'm a star, and there should be a star...
...on my dressing room door.
That's the law of the theater.
Yes, Jerry, give the devil his due.
I know, but I'm nervous. I'll go blank.
I won't be able to remember a line.
Don't worry, Dad.
If you stick, I'll throw you a line.
And you too, mother.
Oh! Thief! Thief! Out! Out!
Why do you do this to me?
It's to jail you're going, me boy!
There, there, there, now.
Henry's not really a bad boy.
He's just mischievous, that's all.
Mr. Schults, I think that should take care of the damage. Don't you think?
Henry, I want you to promise the cop and Mr. Schults...
...that from now on you'll always be a good boy.
I'll promise, but I can still lick any kid in town!
- Fine work, Georgie.
- I'm proud of you.
- Great, Georgie, great.
- Nice going, kid.
- Real piece of acting there, Georgie.
- You're going places.
- Boy, he sure rolled them in the aisles.
- Thanks.
But what are you all so surprised about?
You could've told during rehearsals that I'd be a sensation.
Listen, there's nothing to this acting business.
I wonder what took me so long to become a star.
Excuse me. Hey, Vance.
Call a rehearsal for
Jerry, the time has come for George's first spanking.
That's right.
I'll hold him while you hit him.
Not me. I don't hit hard enough to make an impression.
I can't do it. He'd think I'm jealous because he got more laughs than I did.
Don't think I'm not, either.
Uh, several gentlemen to see you outside, Mr. Cohan.
Oh.
Gentlemen of the press, I presume?
It's started already.
Will you excuse me?
Let's see how tough he is!
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ought to be arrested, every one of those hoodlums.
It seems to me you're taking all this very calmly, Jerry Cohan.
Your own son almost murdered in cold blood.
Well, the way I figure, it's a fine tribute to Georgie's acting.
The way he plays the part, every kid will want to take a punch...
...at Peck's bad boy just to see what happens.
What?! Have I got to go through that every night?
Yes. And matinees Wednesdays and Saturdays.
Georgie, those boys did you a great favor...
...and they saved me a lot of trouble.
You know, most actors give their whole lives to their profession, not once scoring a hit.
You're lucky.
You're a hit at the age of 13.
I've been in this business a long time and never met a performer...
...who, in the long run, wouldn't rather be a great guy than a great actor.
That is, until I made your acquaintance.
Can't I be both?
Chances are, the way you're going, you won't be either.
If the hoodlums don't get you, a committee of actors will.
Actors are considered a very bad risk by insurance companies.
And any actor with a conceit like yours...
...well, we just couldn't afford the premium.
What your father really means is you're too sensitive.
You're too anxious to make good.
You love the theater too much.
Oh, I know you can improve, if you want to.
Sure, I can. Just watch me.
From now on I'm Peck's bad boy only from 8:30 till 11 in the evening.
- That's a boy, Georgie.
- I promise, Mother.
And don't forget Wednesdays and Saturdays, 2:30 till 5.
Yes, sir! And the other 21 and a half hours, I pattern myself after dad.
Heh-heh. Well, you could find a better example...
...but that's the general idea.
Jerry, what do you know.
Ed Albee's coming backstage to see you.
- Albee.
- That's B.F. Keys' partner!
He's big-time vaudeville.
We're in the big time.
He didn't send for us.
He's come here to see us.
Maybe it'd be better if I spoke business to him.
Georgie, I thought you said you were going to reform.
I'm sorry.
When he comes in here,
I want you to keep quiet.
Look at the condition of this room.
Josie, get the cheap makeup off the table.
Hurry up!
Quick, Georgie!
Get the stuff off that shelf there.
That's right.
Hey, Albee'll be right in.
He just stopped at the water cooler.
Jerry, if he offers you a cigar, don't take it.
I'll take it. That'll impress him if he thinks I can smoke.
You get behind that curtain.
Hurry up!
I don't want to hear a word out of you.
I don't even want to hear you breathe.
Josie, fix the chairs. The other one.
Here, take this. Oh, Jerry.
- Sit down, Nellie. Sit down.
- All right.
Come in.
Mr. E.F. Albee.
- Hello, Cohan.
- Mr. Albee.
- Meet Mrs. Cohan.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- Sit down.
Thank you.
I saw your show tonight. Not bad.
Have a cigar?
Uh, no, thanks.
Your show is no good for vaudeville...
...but I've seen a lot worse right here in Brooklyn.
We're opening a new theater in Philadelphia...
...the Bijou, on the Fourth of July.
If you can fix up a good vaudeville act, we'll double your present salary...
...give you 10 weeks' guarantee, and third or fourth billing.
- Double our salary?
- You'll be with the best in the country.
Vesta Victoria, Eddie Foy,
Warren Volk, Charlie Case...
Just a second.
I'm George M. Cohan.
You're opening a theater in Philadelphia on July 4th?
- Yes, that's right.
- That's my birthday.
Heh. Well, that isn't why we're opening the theater.
The salary's all right, but how have you got the nerve...
...to offer us third or fourth billing after my performance tonight?
Is this kid in your show?
Am I in the show?!
Who do you think was Peck's bad boy?
Oh, I beg your pardon.
I didn't quite recognize you.
You didn't? Then maybe you're not the showman you're cracked up to be.
George!
Well, now, maybe I'm not.
Maybe you're not quite ready for the big time yet.
Mrs. Cohan. Mr. Cohan. Good night.
- Good night.
- Uh, Mr. Albee.
- How do you do, Mr. Albee?
- Good evening.
- Call you a carriage?
- If you will.
Carriage for Mr. Albee!
See what happens because you wouldn't lay a hand on him all these years?
A mother isn't supposed to punish.
She just gives her permission.
Have I your permission?
- You certainly have.
- Ahem.
Don't you ought to get my permission too, Dad?
Not the hand! He plays the violin.
All right, not on the hand.
Not on the mouth! He has to sing.
All right, not on the mouth.
Come here.
Here's one place without any talent!
Ow! Ow! Ow!
- Who were Lewis and Clark, George?
- Acrobats?
Look at this swell write-up we got in the clipper.
You'd find us wherever new states sprouted on the prairie.
We played every town in America that had a theater.
Any mail for Mr. Cohan?
No. Your father picked up his mail.
I mean, for Mr. George M. Cohan.
The next 10 years rushed by like a circus train.
Dad seemed content with the sticks, but I was straining at the leash.
Here's your mail, Mr. Cohan.
Oh, thanks.
A couple of tickets for the show.
We played stock in Buffalo.
Being versatile,
I was playing my mother's father.
Oh, Daddy, he has left me.
All is for the best, my daughter.
In life, we trip, but right ourselves.
I was correct about man's love.
First, he considers his pleasure or his honor or his purse.
And only secondly does he think of the woman he says he loves.
Now I must go life's journey alone...
...and struggle on my weary way to find peace.
Courage, Emily, courage.
Living has taught your father many things.
Among them, to take the bitter with the better.
The road to happiness is paved with heartaches and stones.
- Good luck, Josie.
- Thanks, Mom.
They're all yours, sweetheart.
Good luck, honey.
Hey, George, there's a young lady, would like to talk to you.
Show her in.
All right, Miss.
- Mr. Cohan will see you.
- Thank you.
He's all yours.
I'm 18. I sing and I dance, and I'm going to New York.
Should I?
Oh, Mr. Cohan, you're so old and so experienced in the theater.
So fatherly.
Do you think it's wise?
I mean, my being 18, singing and dancing, and going to New York?
Well, ahem, that's very wise.
I mean, being 18 is very wise.
And as for New York...
...The Four Cohans open there this fall with their new show...
...with a new cyclorama and 2 carloads of scenery.
Really? When are you leaving here?
- Tomorrow night, right after the show.
- Oh. I can't leave till Wednesday.
- I graduate from high school Tuesday.
- Oh. That's too bad.
Oh, Georgie... Uh, excuse me.
You haven't forgotten we have a date tonight?
Oh, no, no, no. Of course not.
We're going roller-skating.
Roller-skating on a night like this?
Why, there's a moon out.
I'll be ready in five minutes.
Pipperino, isn't she?
- Yes. Is she your daughter?
- Oh, I'm not married.
- Your niece, perhaps?
- No, she's just a kid with the show.
We've been dating.
Isn't she a little too young for you?
No. She's getting along in years. She's 17.
Well, shall I sing for you?
I know I have talent, even if I am from Buffalo.
Well, we haven't got any piano handy.
Well, I'll dance.
Mm-hm. Ahem.
Well, uh, that's rather old, isn't it?
Everybody's done that. You don't want to be just an imitator, do you?
Oh, no.
Here's a step I made up myself.
But on the other hand...
...you don't want to be too original either, do you?
- No.
- Well, I tell you what you do.
You sit right here. You sit right here, and
I will give you an idea of what I mean.
It may not be much. I'm not the dancer
I used to be, but then who is?
Now, watch carefully now.
Oh, no, no!
- Don't you like it?
- Oh, but your heart!
My heart is every bit as good as it ever was.
Oh, so fast!
Such excitement, at your age.
Sit down and rest.
Maybe I have overdone it a little.
Oh, look at the perspiration on your brow.
Your wrinkles.
What happened to your wrinkles?
Well, I do have to make up older than I actually am, you know.
- How old are you?
- Eh...
Not yet 70.
You seem different from when I first came in.
Even your voice sounds younger.
Well, you see, it's a gift I have.
I'm always as young as the people I'm with...
...and you've made me feel very young.
- Very young. Heh-heh-heh.
- I'm glad.
Well, now, let's make plans.
Which manager should I take you to see first?
Uh, Klaw and Erlanger?
Good old Abe's a very nice fellow, but maybe a little bit too soon.
Uh, Tony Pastor?
Well, that's better.
Albee, Coster, Beale, and Proctor...
- Oh!
- Huh?
- Ooh!
- Oh!
Wait a minute, little girl.
You're not gonna let a beard and eyebrows frighten you, are you?
In show business, you'll see a lot of those.
I'm not sure I want to go into show business now.
With your talent and ability?
There are very few around who can sing and dance and act too.
How do you know I can do all those things?
You've never seen me.
I don't have to. I can tell a trouper a mile away, right on sight.
I feel as though I've known you for years.
- What's your name?
- Mary.
That's a very pretty name, a very pretty name. Now, Mary, you calm down.
Let's have a bite to eat, huh?
I always eat after the last show.
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.
I've been here since 2:00 this afternoon, trying to get up courage to come backstage.
You must be hungry after seven shows.
We'll have a nice cold bottle and a bird.
What's a cold bottle?
In show business we call that a piece of pie and a glass of milk.
Aren't you going roller-skating with that, tlick-tlick, Pipperino?
Nah, I'm tired of picking her up.
- What's the matter, Mary?
- Oh!
Got it.
I was born in Virginia
That's the state that will win ya
If you've got a soul in ya
Ain't no southern frown
In the city of Norfolk
Home of beauties and war talk
- Reckon you'll like it
- If you should strike it
That doggone town
Pretty good. There's a contract in my desk already made out.
Go and get it. Say.
If any of the Cohans ask you how you like their act, just tell them it was fair.
I get you.
Reckon you'll like it
If you should strike it
That doggone town
Ladies and gentlemen...
...my mother thanks you...
...my father thanks you...
...my sister thanks you...
...and I thank you.
Nice going.
That's tearing them out of their chairs.
All set up for you, boys.
Go get them.
Oh, Dad, after the way we went tonight, we're certainly ready for New York.
If we're a hit here, it's a cinch in New York.
- Nice going, kid.
- Thanks.
Oh, uh, Mr. Cohan, just a minute.
- Pretty fair act you folks have got.
- They seemed to like it.
That's a soft audience.
Got any open time?
- Yes, from now on.
- I'd like to make you an offer.
- We'd be glad to talk about it.
- Fine. Fine. Heh.
You know, they're always a soft audience here on Wednesday. Pushover.
- Oh. Mm-hm.
- Did you catch it?
Oh, you were wonderful, George.
- But I don't know. I miss that beard.
- Uh-huh.
- Did you get up on that number?
- Yes. It's a lovely song, George.
- I've learned it by heart.
- Good.
I did it with the orchestra leader, and you do it this show.
He knows your key, and you just follow him for tempo.
There's a notice on the call-board. You can't change your act after the first show.
The manager expects me to sing
"The Wedding of the Lily and the Rose."
Who were they applauding out there, the manager or me?
- Now, go on out there and do it.
- Oh, George, I can't move.
I can't go out there, not without rehearsal.
What are you worried about?
You're doing a George M. Cohan lyric to a George M. Cohan melody.
Yes, but it's my voice.
A George M. Cohan discovery.
Nobody ever had a better start.
There's your introduction. Go on.
Good luck, kid.
When they see it coming
All them babies take a chill
Diamonds glistening all around
And style enough to kill
Her steady fella broke a dice game
Down in Louisville
And buys her chicken every day for lunch "Come seven"
Dreamy eyes that sparkle
And she rolls them mighty cute
Colored gentlemen say
"That lady certainly is a beaut"
Go broke that she's a hot potato
She's a red-hot radiator
She's the warmest baby in the bunch
Ten consecutive weeks in New York.
That's the big time.
When you leave New York,
Philadelphia, Boston...
- Let me take a look at that.
- Excuse me.
What's going on here?
Take your makeup off.
I'll be back in just a minute.
Colored gentlemen say
"That lady certainly is a beaut"
Go broke that she's a hot potato
She's a red-hot radiator
Hey, Bill. What is this?
What's she singing?
Who told her to switch that number?
She's supposed to sing
"The Wedding of the Lily and the Rose."
- Now, who told her to switch that number?
- I don't know.
You don't know?
Bring down that curtain!
Pull out the houselights as soon as she finishes the chorus.
Give her a chance.
See how that song goes.
The song is gone.
Pull out the lights.
- No, don't do it.
- Who does she think she is?
Who does she think is running this theater?
What does she mean by changing her number?
The only reason I put her on was because the dog act got drunk.
- He'll be all right in the morning.
- Oh, she was your idea.
- And a very good idea too.
- Now I know who got the dog act drunk.
Who, me? Why, I've never been in a saloon in my life.
And style enough to kill
Her steady fella broke a dice game Down in Louisville
Now look at that. Could you ask for anything more than that?
Hmm? Just wait. She's wonderful, I think.
Don't you think so?
- Don't do that!
- Ha-ha-ha!
Don't do that! Pull out the lights.
Pull down that curtain.
She...
Get your props together.
You're on next.
Hey, boys, start limbering up.
You follow the jugglers.
You get that curtain up. You can't ring down on a George M. Cohan song.
A George M....? Oh, I see.
Oh, it's your song. You wrote it.
You can tell that by the applause.
Now, Mary, go out there and do an encore.
- Do one more chorus, and really do it.
- Oh, no. No, you don't.
Young lady, if you're gonna be trying out any junk like that...
...do it on a split-fee time, but you'll not be singing songs like that in my theater.
Now you take a little tip from me: you start packing.
If you've got any squawks, unload them on me. I'm the one that started all this.
Listen, squirt, any more interference on your part and you'll be blacklisted.
You won't even be able to get into a stage door of any theater...
...and what's more, as for those songs of yours...
...they won't even be played on a hurdy-gurdy.
- Are you trying to threaten me?
- Oh!
Mary! Mary! Don't pay any attention to him now.
Give me the key to your dressing room.
Drunk or sober, the dog act goes on in the next show.
And look here...
Bring down the curtain!
Cohan, you're fired.
You're canceled! You're washed up!
You and your whole family!
Oh, things were tough.
Well, at least I was in New York.
I had a trunkful of songs and play scripts...
...and a heart full of confidence.
I'm glad I had it.
I'm sorry. I can't use this, Cohan.
Youth needs confidence.
I'd learned my job the hard way, all over the United States.
Guys who had never been past the corner cigar store...
...were saying my stuff was no good.
A kid had to believe in himself to buck that.
Who is the man who will spend
Or will even lend?
- Harrigan
- That's me
Who is your friend when you find
That you need a friend?
- Harrigan
- That's me
I'm just as proud of me name, you see
As an emperor, czar, or a king could be
Who is the man helps a man
Every time he can?
- Harrigan
- That's me
- H
- A
Double R-I
G-A-N spells Harrigan
Proud of all the Irish blood
That's in me
And never a man can say
A word against me
- H
- A
Double R-I
G-A-N, you see
Tlick
Is a name that a shame
Never has been connected with
Harrigan
That's me
H-A
Double R-I
G-A-N spells Harrigan
Proud of all the Irish blood
That's in me
Never a man can say
A word against me
H-A
Double R-I
G-A-N, you see
Is a name that a shame
Never has been connected with
Harrigan
That's me
- Well, what do you think?
- I didn't like it. It didn't appeal to me.
What do you mean, you?
I'm the senior partner around here.
- I make the decisions.
- Well, what did you think?
It didn't appeal to me, either.
Which proves, gentlemen, that you have no ear for music.
He's got no ear for music.
I'm the senior partner.
I have a wonderful ear for music.
But what about the libretto?
It's a grand story, isn't it?
- I laughed all the way through it.
- That's my cue.
If Harold laughs, then I know it isn't funny.
Have Mr. Cohan sing the rest of the score for you.
Maybe you didn't like Harrigan because I haven't got a voice.
Oh, I think you have a lovely voice.
- Don't you think so, Mr. Dietz?
- Yes, you have a very nice voice.
In fact, if you'd like a job answering our phone...
Are you or are you not going to produce my play?
If you think I'd put any of my wife's money into that trash, you're crazy.
That's it, Mary. That's enough.
They've had their chance.
- Have you an appointment?
- Yes. Sam Harris.
I want to see them about this melodrama I have.
We have no time to listen to that junk.
You don't know it, boys, but your days are numbered.
You're making room for the likes of me.
And someday, Mr. Senior Partner, you're gonna come to me and admit you were wrong.
In 20 years of show business,
I never once admitted I was wrong.
That's his department.
- And as for your wife's money...
- Excuse me. I have an appointment.
- Who are you?
- My name's Sam Harris.
I have a melodrama here called Wildflower.
Wildflower.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
- Horses.
- Oh, and Indians. Uh-oh.
Don't let a couple of Gilberts like that get under your skin.
There's no sense in crying now.
Buffalo is such a beautiful city.
Is that what you're crying about?
It's a beautiful city, but I hate to go back to it.
Don't worry. You won't have to.
I'll show them yet.
I'm gonna have my name up and down Broadway... until I'm as well known as Hood's Sarsaparilla.
We'll whip them to a standstill.
- Like Grant took Richmond.
- I never really thought of leaving.
We'll make this whole business sit up and holler for help.
That's what we'll do. They'll all hear from us, every one of them.
I'm the senior partner.
I'll do the throwing out.
You don't have to throw me out. I know the way.
That's the last time
I'll ever bring you a play.
That's my department.
Now I will take it to Klaw and Erlanger.
They don't always think of box office.
Thanks.
- Too expensive.
- Didn't even read the second act.
Probably the biggest forest fire ever put on the stage.
I think he's a little upset.
Five-thirty. We'd have done eight shows by this time in Buffalo.
The juggler just paid three weeks' back board.
Put him at the head so he doesn't have to reach.
Where shall I put the magician?
Until he's paid, he sits at the foot of the table with the Cohans.
Oh, starvation corner.
And put the goulash at the head of the table and keep everything...
...but the noodles and the maple syrup out of the reach of the Cohans.
Noodles and syrup are just enough to keep them alive.
Anybody who owes me two months' board bill, I just keep alive.
I don't have to wait on them.
- Good evening, Madame.
- Good evening, Madame.
Oh, no, no, no.
- From now on, this is your seat.
- Oh, thank you.
And you, master magician, you sit over there with the Cohans.
Heh. Madame, someday I hope you will give me the pleasure...
...of sawing you in half.
- Ha-ha-ha!
- I just heard today...
...that Hammerstein was bringing over the Scotch actor...
...Harry Lauter, at 2500 bucks a week.
Hammerstein's a great showman. A lot of people have never seen a Scotchman.
- Take some goulash, Mrs. Cohan.
- Thank you.
Did you have that appointment with that man about your booking?
Oh, yes, he's going to give work to the act any day now.
What happened to that Boston offer you got?
That was a mighty sweet proposition.
Four weeks guaranteed at $300 a week and top billing.
Well, we didn't take it.
See, it just wasn't right.
Any act that lays off as long as you have, any offer's all right.
Butter?
We just thought we'd rest a few more weeks.
Yes, you see, my brother's writing some new material for us...
...and, well, we're just not ready to open.
You're not fooling anybody.
Everybody knows that you and Nellie and
Josie can get work anytime, anyplace. Heh.
But nobody wants Georgie.
Sure. He's made trouble in every theater this side of San Francisco.
You can't lay off just because every manager has blackballed Georgie.
His family hasn't blackballed him.
We may have to take hard knocks and make a lot of sacrifices...
...but if they want our act, they'll have to take him too.
We're not breaking up our act or our family. And besides...
All right, all right, let the blackballs fall where they may.
Madame Bartholdi, champagne for everybody!
- If I had it, who would pay for it?
- Dietz and Goff.
- They're producing Little Johnny Jones.
- Oh, George, really?
When Dietz heard the music, he said to heck with his wife's money, he's gonna use his own.
A second round of champagne on me, if you had any.
Pass that goulash down to this end of the table.
Oh, George.
Think of those billboards.
Book, music and lyrics, all by George M. Cohan.
- Oh, Georgie, I...
- Oh, now, take it easy, Josie.
- There's enough water in the goulash now.
- Heh-heh-heh.
Oh, uh, Dad, I'm gonna be tied up in rehearsal for the next few months.
Why don't you and mom and Josie take whatever offers in the meantime to fill in.
Well, I hate to see the act split up, George, but if you think so.
Oh, sure. You can play all that stuff around Chicago for Sullivan.
The money's good, and the jumps are short.
It's a good idea.
You get tired resting too long.
But it won't be the same going back on the road without you, Georgie.
Why, we'll be like a carriage with only three wheels.
But you will admit I was a bumpy wheel.
You'll roll along a whole lot easier without me.
- Oh, no, Georgie.
- Oh, but you will.
Is there a part in your play for a bicycle rider?
I used to be known as "Venus on wheels."
Mm-hm. I always knew you weren't a cook.
- How's everything going, George?
- Not so good, kid. Not so good.
I've been pounding the pavement so long, my socks have bunions.
- Say, Matt, would you put a head on that?
- You bet I will.
The villain says, "I'll tell the girl who you are unless you help me hold up this train.
Think fast. It's due in 10 minutes."
You'll have the audience standing with excitement.
I know, I know. The hero helps him, gets shot in the leg...
...and the girl nurses him back to health.
No, no, no. He gets shot in the arm,
Mr. Schwab, not the leg.
- You know what happens next?
- I won't be in the theater to find out.
I will be down the street watching a musical comedy.
Before I put $10,000 into a show...
...it must have songs, dances, and a lot of girls.
Mmm! Women, women.
Little rose petals.
Now, the big scene is where the hero saves the girl from a burning forest fire.
It won't be terribly expensive, Mr. Schwab.
I know where I can get a cheap fire.
You don't need much of a fire, just enough to burn that manuscript.
- Oh, here you are! I've been looking for you.
- What?
We gotta go to Dietz and Goff and sign those papers.
- Papers? What papers?
- What...? What papers?
You don't want to talk about it in front of Schwab.
You haven't discussed our musical with Schwab?
- Music?
- We promised Dietz and Goff.
I haven't said a word about a musical.
Good. Dietz said it's the best musical he's ever read.
Even allowed Goff to agree with him.
When I told him about those 20 ponies and 20 showgirls all coming downstage...
- Ponies and Showgirls?
- Just a minute.
- What are you talking about?
- Waiter, waiter!
- Check for this table.
- No, no, no. That's mine.
Oh, no, no...
Well, we won't argue about it.
- Glad to have met you, Mr. Schwab.
- That's mine.
- Come on, we can't keep Dietz waiting.
- You are a fine guy.
You have girls up your sleeve.
You have ponies and showgirls, and you don't tell me about it?
- What...? What's it about?
- We gave our word to Dietz.
No time for details.
It's about Todd Sloan in London.
- The famous jockey.
- Yeah. Come on, partner.
Jockey? Jockey sounds swell.
Just my luck to miss out on it.
Mmm. Well, good luck, boys.
Oh, uh, you forgot your manuscript.
Before we sign with Dietz and Goff,
I made some change in the lyric...
- ..of "Yankee Doodle."
- "Yankee Doodle"?
- It was perfect the way it was.
- Oh, you're gonna like this.
- Gives the number added value. Watch...
- May I...? May I listen a little?
- Well, think we should?
- I don't know.
- If you promise to be quiet.
- I promise. I promise.
All right. Come on.
There's a piano in the private room.
"Yankee Doodle."
"Yankee Doodle."
Uh-huh. "Yankee Doodle Candy."
Dandy. "Yankee Doodle Dandy."
"Yankee Doodle Candy."
I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy
Yankee Doodle
Do or die
A real live nephew
Of my Uncle Sam
Born on the Fourth of July
I've got a Yankee Doodle sweetheart
She's my Yankee Doodle joy
Yankee Doodle came to London
Just to ride the ponies
I am that Yankee Doodle boy
I have heard enough.
I will never forgive you for trying to palm off a forest fire on me...
...when you had that musical all the time.
Yes, but we gave our word to Dietz.
I can't understand it.
Why is Dietz's wife's money better than my wife's money?
Why?
Must you give it to Dietz and Goff?
- Must you give it?
- Well, I don't know.
I like Dietz, but I'm not too fond of Goff.
I'm crazy about Goff, but I haven't got any use for Dietz.
Gentlemen, you are in perfect agreement.
I will give you a check to bind the deal.
Here.
Thank you.
What's your partner's name?
I don't know.
What's my partner's name? Ha-ha-ha!
Well, don't toy with the kid at a time like this.
Tell him. George M. Cohan.
George M. Cohan. C-O-H-A-N.
And what is my junior partner's name?
Sam H. Harris. Shake.
- Hello. What should I write?
- Uh, Cohan and Harris.
Cohan.
- Mm-hm.
- And Harris.
I'm the kid that's all the candy
I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy
I'm glad I am
So's Uncle Sam
I'm a real-life Yankee Doodle
Made my name on fame and boodle
Just as Mr. Doodle did
By riding on a pony
I love to listen to the Dixie strain
I long to see the girl I left behind me
That ain't a josh
She's a Yankee, by gosh
O say can you see
Anything about a Yankee
That's awful neat
Little Johnny Jones
A jockey from the U.S.A.
Will ride the pony, Yankee Doodle
English derby day
Jones has broken records
Every track at every meet
So Yankee Doodle's gonna be
The boy they have to beat
Sergeant of the British Isles
Who followed his career
Have offered Johnny anything
To keep him over here
But all the money in the Bank of England
Couldn't pay
Enough to keep young Johnny Jones
Away from old Broadway
If you want to take a trip
The surest of sure things
Have your houses mortgaged
Hock your watches, pawn your rings
And put it all on Yankee Doodle
Johnny Jones is up
I'm gonna give America
The English derby cup
He's gonna give
America The English derby cup
I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy
Yankee Doodle
Do or die
A real live nephew
Of my Uncle Sam
Born on the Fourth of July
I've got a Yankee Doodle sweetheart
She's my Yankee Doodle joy
Yankee Doodle came to London
Just to ride the ponies
I am that Yankee Doodle boy
He's a Yankee Doodle Dandy
A Yankee Doodle
Do or die
A real live nephew of his Uncle Sam
Born on the Fourth of July
He's got a Yankee Doodle sweetheart
She's his Yankee Doodle joy
Yankee Doodle came to London
Just to ride the ponies
He is a Yankee Doodle boy
Yankee Doodle came to London
Just to ride the ponies
He is a Yankee Doodle boy
Good luck, Johnny
Success to you
All the best of the best to you
We'll make our bets
And leave the rest to you
Because you've got
What it takes to win
There they are, going to the post
All in good condition
That's Yankee Doodle on the end
A wonderful position
Look at him rear, he's broken line
He's simply wild to run
Now they're back in line again
There's the starting gun
They're off
Come on, Yankee Doodle
We have bet the whole caboodle on you
Run, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up
Yankee takes the lead
Break away there
Show them how to earn their hay there
How to run, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up
Show a little speed
At the quarter, he's gaining
At the turn now, he's reining his horse
Go, go, go, don't hold him back
Let him go
At the half mark, he's cruising
But seems to be losing his lead
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up
You simply have to win
He'll never win, he'll never win
The other nags are closing in
- He's gone to third from second place
- Looks like he's thrown the race
They've got him in a pocket
He can't get in the clear
They're in the stretch, here they come
He's falling to the rear
He's lost the race, but it's a frame
We'll find the blighter who's to blame
And clear the name of Little Johnny Jones
Aw!
Well, that's it, ladies and gentlemen, it's all over.
Yankee Doodle let them down.
So they'll either pasture him in clover...
...or have him hauling rubbish in London Town.
Good-bye, Johnny
We're through with you
We'll have nothing to do with you
You've been dishonest.
And we find that you'll be suspended for throwing the race.
I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy.
Yankee Doodle, do or die.
Yankee Doodle came to London.
Just to ride the ponies.
I am that Yankee Doodle boy.
For he was that Yankee Doodle
Boy
Women, women. Little rose petals.
Wonderful. You've got them eating right out of your hand.
- My congratulations.
- Thanks, Sam.
As long as those critics don't eat off my leg.
Don't worry about the critics.
You got a smash hit. It's in the air.
You can't stop anything that's in the air.
All aboard
We'll soon be sailing for
The city of old New York
Broadway nights
A million dancing lights
Thrilling sights everywhere you walk
London Town
We're bidding you adieu
Gee, we hate to say good-bye to you
All aboard
Good-bye to London Town
Hello to old Broadway
All right, on the boat.
Now, remember, Jones, watch for the skyrocket.
If it goes off, you'll know that I've obtained certain papers from Ansty's cabin...
...that'll prove you innocent of throwing the English derby.
It'll mean complete vindication.
So stick here on the pier and watch for the skyrocket.
Thanks, pal. I'll be watching.
Good-bye, Johnny. And don't worry, we still believe in you.
Thanks, kid. That'll help a lot.
- Good-bye.
- Bye.
Give my regards
To Broadway
Remember me to Herald Square
Tell all the gang
At 42nd Street
That I will soon be there
Whisper of how I am yearning
To mingle with that old-time throng
Give my regards
To old Broadway
And say that I'll be there ere long
We'll give your regards to Broadway
Remember you to Herald Square
We'll tell all the gang
At 42nd Street
That you will soon be there
We'll whisper of how you're yearning
To mingle with the old-time throng
We'll give your regards
To old Broadway
And say that you'll be there ere long
We'll whisper of how you're yearning
To mingle with the old-time throng
We'll give your regards
To old Broadway
And say that you'll be there ere long
Ha-ha!
We'll whisper of how you're yearning
To mingle with the old-time throng
We'll give your regards
To old Broadway
And say that you'll be there ere long
That was your department.
Is it the robin that heralds the first breath of spring?
How can you think of robins in the spring when we're freezing to death in Illinois?
Hey, Jerry, did you see the way they're billing you in Waukegan?
Come here. Look at that.
Funny, isn't it'?
"Jerry, Nellie, and Josie Cohan...
...the family of George M. Cohan, the new Broadway sensation."
Hey, the kid's doing all right, isn't he?
Look at that.
Well, that's true.
He is the biggest thing on Broadway.
Yeah, I know, but it ain't right.
We'll build our own reputation.
We'll be billed as we should be:
The Three Cohans.
All right, no need to get excited.
Don't think I'm jealous of Georgie's success...
...even though I am a better actor.
Of course you're not jealous.
Everybody knows that.
Oh, there'll be no stopping George.
All he needs is a little more experience, and he'll be a genius.
He mustn't know I'm better. It might interfere with him becoming a genius.
Still, it does look a little funny:
George being the toast of Broadway...
...and you folks gathering a few crumbs in the tank towns.
- Is either of you fellas Jerry Cohan?
- I am.
It's from George.
"Impossible to find three clever actors named Cohan...
...for my new show anywhere in New York.
Return immediately for rehearsals."
- What'd I tell you?
- The four of us back together again...
...and on Broadway!
Oh, you wonderful girl
What a wonderful girl you are
You made the world appear to me
Near to me, dear to me
Blue skies, gray skies
Main Street or Broadway skies
Under December or May skies
I'll be true to you
Everybody's going to the barber's ball
There ain't a-gonna be any sleep at all
Until the stars are gone
Until the break of dawn
We're going to dance
At the barber's ball
Even in the kitchen, you sound like a tetrazzini.
Heh. In Buffalo, they say
I have a nice little voice.
Yeah. A lot they know in Buffalo.
In Buffalo they thought I was an old man.
Well, how do you like your part so far?
Oh, I like it.
I like it because it's small.
I'd be afraid to try anything bigger.
You've got something on the leading lady.
You got the best song.
Here it is. It's finished. Come on.
- What about the lyrics?
- Gonna give it to you now.
Sit down and give me a pickup.
My mother's name was Mary.
She was so good and true.
Because her name was Mary...
...she called me Mary too.
She wasn't gay or airy...
...but plain as she could be.
I'd hate to meet a Mary...
...who called herself Marie.
For it is Mary...
...Mary...
...plain as any name can be.
But with propriety...
...society...
...will say, "Hm-hm. Marie."
But it was Mary...
...Mary...
...long before the fashions came.
And there is something there...
...that sounds so square...
...it's a grand old name.
For it is Mary
Mary
Plain as any name can be
But with propriety
Society will say, "Marie"
But it was Mary
Mary
Long before the fashions came
And there is something there
That sounds so square
It's a grand old name
Mm-hm. Yeah.
Gee, I never cared much for my name before. It was kind of common.
Gee, there are millions of
Marys around, but now...
But I didn't write it for the millions of Marys.
I wrote it for one particular, very special Mary.
Gee, it's a wonderful feeling having your name written to music.
- And not bad music, either, huh?
- Nope, it isn't.
But how will everybody know that I'm the Mary?
I want to make sure that everybody knows it was written for me.
They'll know, all right.
When they look at you singing that song and then look at me looking at you...
- ...they'll know.
- Oh, George.
Take that up an octave.
- George.
- Better.
Excuse me for butting in.
I've been looking all over town for you.
Strange that I should find you here.
Hello, Mary.
Mr. Harris, George has just written a new song for me to sing in his show.
- Think I can do it?
- Of course. You've got a nice little voice.
That is not a little voice, and you need an ear trumpet.
Come on, we've gotta get off to the Lyceum.
We've got to see Fay Templeton.
- What does she want to see us about?
- She doesn't. We want to see her.
You need a leading lady.
You've got your ingenue.
- George.
- Hmm, Fay Templeton. That's not bad.
She can do four years for us.
- Think she'll take it?
- I don't know.
- At least you can get her autograph.
- Or for her to get mine.
Bring her back to supper after the show.
I will if she's still speaking to us.
Would you like to buy it? Thank you.
There's one thing in our favor.
Erlanger's on our side.
- He's got influence with Miss Templeton.
- You talk to him, and I'll tackle Templeton.
You don't tackle a star like Miss Templeton.
- You approach her and very tactfully too.
- Well, if it's tact that does it, it's done.
If you get me in to see Miss Templeton,
I'll get you two passes to my next show.
Dan, look. Dietz.
Looks naked without Goff.
Heh. Yeah. Where's Miss
Templeton's dressing room'?
- Upstairs.
- I tell you what I'm going to do.
I'm gonna see to it that Miss
Templeton gets your flowers.
My respects to Mrs. Dietz.
Now, that was a very sweet gesture.
But you've got to remember, Fay, we're having a tough time...
...lining up a vehicle for you.
Now, you should listen to this man.
- He's just written a big hit.
- One hit.
He may be a flash in the pan for all we know.
And I heard about
Little Johnny Jones.
And I read the critics... Pfft.
...Of all the loud, vulgar flag-waving.
Well, it was a wow.
I haven't laughed so much in years.
The fellow's got the golden touch.
Maybe so, but not for me, Mr. Erlanger.
What I want is a quiet, dignified musical play.
I want to perform in a theater, not a boiler factory.
Come in.
- Hello, Harris. How are you, Cohan?
- Hello, Abe.
Everything's all right. You'll see.
Oh, uh, Fay, uh, may I present Mr. Harris.
- How do you do?
- And, uh, Fay, this is Mr. Cohan.
- George M. Cohan.
- How do you do?
We were just talking about you, George.
Miss Templeton's never seen your work.
Hmm. Been sick or in Europe?
No. I've been right here on this stage for two years.
Oh, buried.
Oh, uh, don't misunderstand me,
Miss Templeton. I, uh...
Well, I've never been at a loss for words before...
...but right now standing here in your presence, why, I hardly...
Well, I'd prefer to have these flowers speak for me.
- Why, Mr. Cohan, how sweet of you.
- Oh, it was nothing at all.
Excuse me for breaking in on you like this, Miss Templeton...
...but I would like to present my own flowers my own way.
- But, Mr. Cohan, I thought... Is he?
- Drunk.
May I have the honor of supping with you at Rex's tonight after the show...
...and drinking champagne out of your...
- Pardon me.... slipper?
- Excuse me, Mr. Dietz.
Haven't you forgotten that your junior partner, Goff, does all the drinking?
Yes, but on special occasions,
I take over...
May I put these in water for you?
- Well, really, I...
- I never saw Dietz drunk before.
Heh-heh. Well, uh, shall we get down to business?
If you like, Abe.
Well, George, how would you like to do a play...
...with one of the biggest stars in America?
- What do you think I've been doing?
- Heh. Yes.
You see what I mean, Fay?
Heh-heh. Isn't he a card?
Positively a riot.
Yes, well, George, what's your new story like?
That is, I mean, can you write a play without a flag?
Miss Templeton, I can write a play without anything except a pencil.
- Laugh. Now, look...
- There's really no use discussing anything.
I would never please the sort of people who revel in your antics and fireworks.
Oh, you're just being modest,
Miss Templeton.
If you'd let yourself go, you'd be just as noisy and entertaining as the rest of us.
You might even have fun yourself.
Abe, isn't it about time for the curtain to go up?
Look, if you haven't got time now, maybe a few minutes after the show.
I'm sorry. After the show
I'm going home to New Rochelle.
It's only 45 minutes from here...
...but it's like a thousand miles from all the noisy, neurotic people...
...one has to associate with in our profession.
Now, Miss Templeton, you can't...
- Fay, I warned you.
- That tact of yours. That wonderful tact.
What are you thinking about?
Well, have you thought it over, Fay?
I'm not interested in Mr. Cohan or his plays.
Now you're making a great mistake, Fay.
He's the most original thing that ever hit Broadway. You know why?
Because he's the whole darn country squeezed into one pair of pants.
His writing, his song, why, even his walk and his talk...
...they all touch something way down here in people.
Now, don't ask me why it is, but it happens every time the curtain goes up.
It's pure magic.
I'm bored by magic.
I know his formula.
A fresh, young sprout gets rich between 8:30 and 11 p.m.
Yes, that's just it, Fay.
George M. Cohan has invented the success story.
And every American loves it because it happens to be his own private dream.
He's found the mainspring in the antique clock.
Ambition, pride, patriotism.
That's why they call him the Yankee Doodle boy.
Now, if you'll take a tip from me, Fay, you'll do just what I'm doing.
You'll hitch your wagon to his star right now.
Abe, I've got to change for the second act.
Now, Fay, don't make up your mind too quickly.
Take a little time. Think it over.
Who's locked my door?
- Who is it?
- What's going on here?
He'll be through in a minute.
Excuse me. I beg your pardon.
I didn't realize who you were. Come in.
- May I?
- Why, of course.
What does this mean?
Would you mind telling me why you're still here?
Well, here it is, ready and dedicated to you.
- What?
- Well, uh, when you made that exit speech...
...you said you lived only 45 minutes away.
That struck me as being a perfect title for a show and for a song.
During the first act, you've written this new song?
Strange surrounding.
It took me longer.
He's worked so hard.
The least you could do is hear it.
- Yeah, it'll only take a minute, won't it?
- Depends on the encores. Heh.
Well, you certainly are persistent.
All right, go ahead.
- Mind if I change?
- Oh, thank you.
That's wonderful of you. Thank you very, very much. Go ahead, George. Play it.
Only 45 minutes from Broadway
Think of the changes it brings
For the short time it takes
What a difference it makes
In the ways of the people and things
Oh, what a fine bunch of Reubens
Oh, what a jay atmosphere
They have whiskers like hay
And imagine Broadway
Only 45 minutes from here
Only 45 minutes
That's good. It's rather different.
- You liked it, Miss Templeton?
- Ah!
Excuse me.
That's only a chorus number.
He's got one number called "Mary" that's perfect for you.
- She doesn't sing that.
- She is gonna sing it.
- No, no, no.
- Shut up.
It's the best thing he's ever done.
"Mary," hmm?
This looks very interesting.
It's only a so-so number.
If it's as good as "45 Minutes from Broadway"...
- Well, it isn't, and besides, you...
- What do you want to do, spoil everything?
- I can't let her have that.
- What difference does it make?
- She's gonna sing it. She will.
- But she can't sing it.
With Abe's money and your brains, we'll be able to make a million.
Shh!
For it is Mary
Mary
Society will say
"Marie"
But it was Mary
Mary
Long before the fashions came
Come in.
Oh! A little early for
Christmas, isn't it?
Well, I was just passing the flowers, and they threw in the candy.
George, I'm sure our song will live forever.
I've been playing it ever since you left, and the neighbors haven't complained once.
What happened with Fay Templeton?
Oh, she's dying to play the part.
But I haven't made up my mind yet.
Mmm. Ham or bacon?
- Bacon.
- Good. Ham makes me self-conscious.
You're hesitating about having
Fay Templeton in your show?
You know how those big stars are.
Temperamental and hard to get along with.
Asking impossible terms and conditions.
- I'll take my coffee black.
- You ought to give in to her.
But, darling, no matter what she asks?
- No matter what she asks.
- Why are you so concerned for Templeton?
Oh, I don't care for Templeton.
I'm looking out for you.
Think what it means for you to have a star like Templeton in your show.
Mm-hm. Always worried about me, aren't you? Ever think about yourself?
Not much lately. Haven't had time.
The minute I saw you without your beard...
...I knew here was a little boy who needed looking after...
- ...so I gave myself the job.
- Mm-hm.
There are a lot of singers, you know, but very few really good looker-afters.
Mm-hm.
Darling, how would you like a lifetime job of looking after?
Leading lady, run of the play...
...maybe a few heartaches after the curtain goes up...
...but I can guarantee you some laughs.
How does it sound?
I think I might like it, Mr. Cohan.
Could I, uh, see some of the script?
Mm-hm.
Hmm.
Not bad for a first reading.
The coffee's boiling over.
Darling, there's something
I forgot to tell you.
- Yes, dear?
- Uh, I gave your song to Templeton tonight.
Mm-hm.
Darling, did you hear me? I, uh...
I gave your song to Fay Templeton tonight.
Yes, I know. I knew you did, dear, when you brought the candy and flowers.
My mother's name was Mary
She was so good and true
Because her name was Mary
She calls me Mary too
She wasn't gay or airy
But plain as she could be
I'd hate to meet a Mary
Who calls herself Marie
For it was Mary
Mary
Plain as any name can be
But with propriety
Society will say, "Marie"
For it was Mary
Mary
Long before the fashions came
And there is something there
That sounds so square
It's a wonderful song, George, best you've ever done. It'll live for years.
Thanks, Sam. But I still think
Mary should have sung it.
Oh, that's all right. Fay has the song, but I have the author.
And there is something there
That sounds so square
It's a grand
Old
Name
Only 45 minutes from Broadway
Think of the changes it brings
For the short time it takes
What a difference it makes
In the ways of the people and things
Oh, and things
Oh, what a fine bunch of Reubens
Oh, what a jay atmosphere
They have whiskers like hay
And imagine Broadway
Only 45 minutes from here
It's awfully nice of all you boys
To see me to the train
So long, Mary
I didn't think you'd care
If you should never see me again
You're wrong, Mary
This reminds me of my family
On the day I left Schenectady
To the depot
Then they came with me
I seem to hear them say
"So long, Mary"
Mary, we will miss you so
"So long, Mary"
How we hate to see you go
"And we'll all be longing for you, Mary
While you roam"
So long, Mary
Don't forget to come back home
So long, Mary
Oh, oh, oh, oh
How we hate to see you go
So long, Mary
Don't forget to come back home
And we'll all be longing for you, Mary
While you're gone
So long, Mary
Don't forget
To come back
Home
Look at Cohan. He's got them lined up at the box office.
I've never seen the guy. Got his name all over the place. Look at that.
"Cohan and Harris present
George Washington, Jr.
Starring the author and composer,
George M. Cohan."
I wonder what the M is for.
Oh, modesty.
- Hello, Mr. Foy.
- How are you?
- Enjoyed your show last night.
- Thank you.
You always appear in the kind of stuff I like.
Thank you. That's very nice of you.
"George M. Cohan and his royal family.
Books and lyrics, music, and direction by George M. Cohan.
Printed by Sam Divensky."
That must be Cohan's alias.
Certainly keeps himself in billing, this George M. Cohan.
Don't memorize that one.
There's plenty all over town.
I'd like to forget it. Say, listen, you connected with this turkey?
Turkey? I hear it's pretty good.
It's a malicious rumor to gyp the public.
Who is this guy Cohan? Where is he from?
What is he, an upstart?
Oh, he's been through the mill. Small-time and big-time vaudeville, rep shows.
- Even followed dog acts.
- Must have looked like an encore.
- Say, uh, is he as good as Foy?
- Who?
Foy, Foy, Eddie Foy.
Oh, pardon me.
Pardon me, I didn't quite catch the name.
Would you mind spraying it again?
Eddie Foy.
The star that's got the big show down the street with a chorus of 70.
Why, I thought they looked a little younger than that.
I hear now that Cohan's in town,
Foy's gonna retire.
Foy won't retire till he's 90.
Is it gonna take him that long to discover he has no talent?
They tell me when he tries to sing, the orchestra puts up umbrellas.
Tries to sing? Why, he's a genius.
He keeps his audience glued to the seats.
That's one way of keeping them in the theater. Cohan does it with talent. Look.
Produces his own plays, writes his own books, lyrics and music, plays the leads...
- ...and is a great dancer.
- He dances, eh?
When does he get time to practice?
When you write your own plays, you don't have to. Cohan's done all right.
He's given the world "Yankee Doodle
Dandy." What's Foy done for his country?
He gave them seven kids.
- Does he dance?
- One of the best.
When does he get time to practice?
Say, listen, young fella, my name's Eddie Foy.
I know it. I'm George M. Cohan.
Oh, so you're Cohan?
Well, if I said anything accidental to make you mad...
...I want you to know
I'm darn glad I did.
I don't blame you. I'd feel the same way if I were up against Cohan.
- What do like to drink?
- Oh, moxie.
I can supply it. The attraction inside is a whole lot bigger than I am.
Come and see when your show closes.
There's a feeling comes a-stealing
And it sets my brain a-reeling
When I listen to the music
Of a military band
Every tune like "Yankee Doodle"
Simply sets me off my noodle
It's that patriotic something
That no one can understand
Way down south in the land of cotton
Melody untiring
It's so inspiring
Hurrah, hurrah
We joined the jubilee
And that's going some
For the Yankees, by gum
Red, white and blue I am for you
Honest, you're a grand old flag
You're a grand old flag
You're a high-flying flag
And forever in peace may you wave
You're the emblem of
The land I love
The home of the free and the brave
Every heart beats true
Under red, white and blue
Where there's never a boast or brag
But should old acquaintance be forgot
Keep your eye on that grand old flag
Rally round the flag
Let us rally round the flag
We took the red from the flame of dawn...
...the dawn of a new nation.
And the white was the white of the snow at Valley Forge.
The blue was the blue of the free, open sky...
...and the stars were the 13 sisters by the sea...
...who built their home and called it liberty.
To symbolize the spirit
Right!
The spirit of freedom
Right again!
The spirit that gave birth to American
Democracy
That's the spirit!
You're a grand old flag
What a grand old flag
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
His truth goes marching on
And that government...
...of the people...
...by the people...
...for the people, shall not perish...
...from the earth.
When Johnny comes marching home again
Hurrah, hurrah
We'll give him a hearty welcome then
Hurrah, hurrah
The men will cheer
The boys will shout
The ladies, they will all turn out
And we'll all feel gay
When Johnny comes marching home
We're one for all and all for one
Behind the man
Behind the gun
And now that we're in it
We're going to win it
We can't lose a minute
There's work to be done
We're with them
We're with them
United we stand
In peace and war
We're with them
We're with them
We'll fight as we did before
My country 'tis of thee
Sweet land of liberty
Of thee we sing
You're a grand old flag
You're a high-flying flag
And forever in peace may you wave
You're the emblem of
The land I love
The home of the free and the brave
Every heart beats true
Under red, white and blue
Where there's never a boast or brag
But should old acquaintance be forgot
Keep your eye on the grand old flag
Should old acquaintance be forgot
Keep your eye on the grand
Old
Flag
Like the wandering minstrel
I have slouched along the way
Wandering day by day
No selection of direction
Till I heard a lovely voice
Which seemed to softly say
Come along with me
Come along with me away
May I have your autograph, Mr. Cohan?
To what do you attribute your continued success, Mr. Cohan?
Oh, I'm an ordinary guy who knows what ordinary guys like to see.
Front row center, the greatest show on earth, the people.
To the people. God bless them.
Here, chick, chick, chick.
- Here, chick, chick, chick.
- Heh.
Oh, it's such fun, Mother, having cows and chickens.
And everything's running so smoothly.
Well, it's always been a dream of ours, Mary.
We kept hoping for 20 years that it might come true someday.
Imagine knowing how to feed chickens or how much to feed them.
And you're a farmer only three weeks.
Jerry and I have seen a lot of chickens in train windows...
...and we always wanted to raise some of our own.
You know, watch them hatch and feed them and eat them.
If we only could. They're so pretty.
- Georgie?
- Yeah?
- What'd you get Dad for his birthday?
- Oh, nothing much. Just a smoking jacket.
Is it bright? Lots of color?
I mean, will he like it?
Well, it's silk and very red and very yellow.
That'll do it.
Look what I got him, Georgie.
Well, now, there's a present.
That must have set you back a few.
Dad needed a new watch.
His old one's so loud, you can hear it right through his coat.
My future husband helped me pick it out.
Your future what?
Husband. We're getting married as soon as Fred's road tour is over.
Well...
Hm.
Hm.
Little Josie's gonna get married, huh?
Oh, it doesn't seem that long ago...
Hmm.
What happens to The Four Cohans?
Oh, just a simple case of subtraction.
You know, one from four leaves three.
- Three Cohans.
- Mm-mm.
That's only arithmetic.
One Cohan from four
Cohans leaves nothing.
Mom and Pop know?
Mm-hm.
Mom's been working on the wedding dress for weeks.
What are you thinking about, Georgie?
I'm gonna write you the most terrific wedding march ever put on paper.
It'll pack the pews.
Say, Dad, will you tell Josie that there's no reason to break up the act?
The Four Cohans are as much an institution as marriage is.
Oh, Georgie, no one knows that any better than I do...
...but we want to settle down and raise a family.
What's the matter? Can't he raise a family and be a stage manager too?
- Hmm?
- George.
George, I'm afraid your mother and I are breaking up the act before Josie is.
You hear that, Sam?
All three of them walking out on me.
There's been a 40-year run, remember?
We're giving you our two weeks' notice, George. Heh.
All we'd like to do now is spend the rest of our days here on this farm.
But you can't do that. You can't put an actor out to grass. Fresh air kills him.
We've gained nearly 10 pounds apiece.
You can work it off. The show is ready to go into rehearsal.
There are grand parts in it for both of you.
No, George, I...
We've had good times together.
And, well, new shows need new faces and new feet to go with you.
From now on, it's just you alone, son.
Well, what's this?
- A surprise, Dad.
- Happy birthday!
- For me? Heh.
- You get your own birthday.
- Look at the size of that one.
- Make a wish.
- Make your wish.
- I have.
A good one, Dad.
Which one do you want to open first?
How about opening this one?
Let me help you.
- This one will match your suit, Dad.
- Somebody gave me that last year.
Well, it looks fine.
Had it made up on that old backdrop you like so well, fireproofed and everything.
Oh, darling, that's a lovely watch. Heh.
I'm so glad you like it, Dad.
This is better than being on next to closing.
The only trouble is it's three minutes fast.
Heh-heh. Dad, press the little button on the side and see what happens.
It plays one on one and segues into "Dixie."
Here's some more ties that you won't like, Jerry.
I'll have to open up a store, huh?
Heh-heh.
- Oh, uh...
- Here's a letter from George.
- Don't open that now...
- You haven't written me a letter in 20 years.
I'm gonna open it now, and I'm gonna read it.
George, this isn't your party.
Sit down and let him read his letter.
"Dear Dad, this is your 62nd birthday, and God bless you.
Maybe I've never told you before, but no son ever had a better dad...
...or one to be prouder of.
You and mother have always given me more love and understanding...
...than I ever deserved.
And all the luck I've had is due to the things you two have taught me.
Nothing I can do could ever repay the debt.
But here's a little present for you and mother.
From this day on, you and I are partners...
...in every theater and theatrical property I possess...
...half and equal.
The Cohan Theater, the Astor, the Gaiety...
...and the Grand Opera
House in Chicago...
...and all my plays and songs as long as they...
...or you and I, live."
These are not my reading glasses.
Why didn't somebody give me some reading glasses for my birthday?
"Wish you all my love...
...your son and partner, George."
Well, George, on behalf of your mother and myself, I...
There she goes stealing the scene again.
One success followed another...
...but there was one challenge
I hadn't met.
Critics kept saying that musicals and cheap comedies were all I could write.
I could wave a flag, they said.
Nothing else.
So I wrote a legitimate drama, very deep and very significant.
No music, no gags, no flag-waving.
I called it Popularity.
The title showed how hard I was hoping.
I couldn't attend the opening because I was down the street...
...in The Yankee Prince.
- Open it up.
- Keep it closed, Buck.
Cohan, you're surely not going to your dressing room now.
You're good for at least another five curtain calls.
That's enough for tonight.
Mr. Cohan, are you sure you're feeling well?
I feel all right.
Any news from Popularity?
No, but they should be ringing down just about now.
You'd think my family would let me know.
Well, it's a good sign. They probably couldn't tear themselves away.
- What time is it?
- Seven-thirty.
- That clock right?
- Yes, sir.
That's an early show.
They ought to be here by now.
- Maybe something wrong with Mom and Dad.
- I've got reports on the minstrel show.
- What'd we lose this week?
- Oh, 10,000, more or less.
- What's the total loss so far?
- A few dollars under 200,000.
Hmm. That include the cost of the red ink?
Popularity better be a hit.
Got a lot of dough sunk in that too.
Eddie, call Wallachs and find out what's keeping them.
What did the papers say about the minstrel show?
Here they are. Rave notices again.
Hmm, rave notices. That's bad.
The better notices you get on minstrel shows, the more it costs you.
All except the last act.
Alecson suggests a new finish.
Hmm, I see. A new finish. Hm.
How about Saturday night?
- Close it?
- Close it.
- Saturday night.
- Mm-hm.
- Give the company two weeks' salary.
- All right.
- Oh, good evening, Mrs. Cohan.
- Good evening.
- Hello, dear.
- Hello, Mom. Hi, darling.
Dad, I was worried about you.
I wondered what happened.
Sit down. Right here. You sit down.
That theater's awfully cold, George.
Better have some more heat put in there.
- Take care of that right away.
- Remember that skating act in Camden?
They were there.
I wonder where they got the money.
Finnegan, Feeney, and Riley.
I remember them well.
Well, come on, tell me, how'd it go?
Well, the audience loved it, every minute of it.
The sets were beautiful, George.
Uh...
Why so quiet, Sam?
The toughest house I've ever seen.
The critics walked out at the end of the second act.
Hmm.
Mm-hm.
Come on, Dad. Come on, let's have it.
Heh. Well, there's no use beating around the bush.
Pretty bad, George.
Could've been a lot better.
All right, you write a bad play.
The only thing to do is forget about it.
Everybody's entitled to one failure.
Let's go to Delmonico's, have the party, just as though the show was a hit.
You take the girls on over there, and I'll see you in about a half-hour.
I've got some things I want to talk over with Sam.
Those critics have been after my blood for years.
They'll gang up on me and do a good job of it, but I'll beat them to it.
I'll take an ad in every paper right alongside their reviews...
...telling the public we've got the greatest show in town...
...sold out for 10 weeks in advance, we'll run a year.
The public will believe me.
- Listen, Georgie, you can't do that.
- Why not?
Too big a reputation.
You can't disappoint the public.
They'll never forgive you, never trust you again.
We stuck our necks out, and we got clipped.
Georgie.
You can't do this.
You'll always regret it.
- Sit down and take this.
- We'll be sorry.
- To the theater-going public.
- George...
To the theater-going public.
I wrote a play called Popularity.
Mr. Harris and I produced that play.
In the opinion of people we respect, it is a bad play.
In this, we heartily concur.
It is a very bad play.
I do humbly apologize and ask forgiveness...
...for having presented anything of which you couldn't possibly approve.
There will be five more performances.
Please miss them.
Signed...
Happy?
It's a wonderful second-act curtain.
Send copies of this to all the papers for the next edition.
Extra! Lusitania torpedoed by German sub!
This is it, George.
And we were worried about the success or failure of a show.
Now we've really got something to worry about.
It seems it always happens.
Whenever we get too high-hat, too sophisticated for flag-waving...
...some thug nation decides we're a pushover, all ready to be blackjacked.
And it isn't long before we're looking up anxiously...
...to be sure the flag's still waving over us.
Left foot.
Right foot.
On your toes.
I used to be a model.
You'll look awful pretty peeling potatoes.
- On your way, wise guy.
- Next.
Left foot. Right foot.
All right. Take this paper and report to
Sergeant Cooper for your examination.
Next. Name, please. Oh.
"George M. Cohan.
Occupation: actor, author, composer, and producer.
- Address: Devonshire Hotel."
- How do you know so much about me?
Don't you recognize me, Mr. Cohan?
I used to be a clerk at the Friars Club.
- Oh.
- Heh-heh. "Age: 39."
- Doesn't even give me a chance to lie about it.
- Thirty-nine? I'm sorry, Mr. Cohan.
- You're overage. Thirty-one's the limit now.
- What's eight or nine years, more or less?
- The Germans won't ask for a birth certificate.
- I know how you feel, Mr. Cohan...
...but you've got to be young and tough for this army.
It's no picnic, all those hardships.
The mental strain, the trenches, the fighting, the marching.
- And the mademoiselles.
- I hope.
- No, you'll never be able to stand it.
- Hardships and physical strain?
Young man, you don't know what you're talking about.
This war's a coffee klatsch compared to a season with a musical show.
I'd like to see these kids do what I do...
...in a performance and be on their feet at the finish.
I'll give you an idea of what I mean.
Well, thank you very much for your entertainment, Mr. Cohan...
...but I'm afraid we have more need of you here than over there.
Well, that'll make the war last a year longer.
- Good-bye, Mr. Cohan.
- Thank you, major. Thank you.
- So long.
- Good-bye.
Johnny, get your gun
Get your gun, get your gun
Take it on the run
On the run, on the run
Hear them calling you and me
Every son of liberty
Hurry, right away!
No delay. Go today.
Make your daddy glad
To have had such a fad
Tell your sweetheart not to pine
To be proud her boy's in line

- The generator's gone again.
Hit your lights so we can keep going, will ya?
- All right.
- Fine, thanks.
Hit your lights and keep them on the singer until the others come.
- Certainly.
- Fine. Thanks very much.

We'd won the World War.
Manhattan went wild with postwar hysteria.
But I spiked my shows with prewar stuff...
...the sentiment and humor an older
America had aged in the wood.
In a kingdom all our own
With little cupid on the throne
With a prince
And princess on my knee
You'll be as happy as can be
In a love nest
Cozy and warm
Like a dove nest
Down on a farm
And it's all daylong
They bray
Flowers all dripping with dew
And they join in the chorus
Of Nellie Kelly
I love you
He is the man
Who owns Broadway
That's what the daily papers say
Oh, where could you find another?
I'd like to be shown
Another like Molly Malone
But I love the name Billie
My dad's was the same
Billie
Still, it was lonely on the main stem.
Mother and Josie were gone.
Dad was by himself on the farm and had grown very old.
Every night I went to the theater,
I expected a phone call.
Well, finally it came.
You'd better give him two more ccs.
We might as well try to make him as comfortable as possible.
Yes, Dr. Anderson.
If you have to get back to town,
Dr. Llewellyn, I'll be here all night.
It's all right. I'll wait till George M. gets here from the theater.
- Cigarette, doctor?
- Yes, I will.
Thanks.
I remember I was a kid in medical college in Baltimore...
...when I first saw The Four Cohans.
They were a great act.
Yes, they were.
I always thought George M.'s sister was the loveliest dancer I'd ever seen.
Can't help thinking a theatrical era is dying in there.
His sister and his mother gone and now the old man.
In some ways, I think he was the best performer of the lot.
Well, I'd settle for his age.
There never was anything dull about his life, either.
And he's lived to see his son an American institution.
Yeah.
I'd settle for that too.
Hello, Mr. Cohan.
- How is he?
- Resting quietly.
Oh. I see.
I think you'd better go in alone.
We can't... We can't do that.
Wait till George gets here.
Where's George?
Here I am, Dad. Here I am.
Oh, that's good. I'm glad you came.
The booking office has been calling up all day...
...and they want us to play Des
Moines the last half of the week.
Don't worry about that.
We're not going to. I've canceled it.
We can pick it up on the way back.
- How did it go tonight? Mmm.
- Oh, fine. Fine. Yeah.
It's not every kid gets that gets the chance to play Peck's bad boy.
That's right.
Were you...? Were you nervous?
Did you remember your lines?
Oh, sure. Every one.
- "I can lick any kid in town."
- Heh. Good.
Now, don't you upstage your mother, or I'll whale the tar out of you.
Don't worry, Dad. I'll never do that.
I'll play the whole show with one foot in the trough.
No, no, no. We've been billed as The Four Cohans.
You're not gonna break up the act.
Don't worry, Dad. They never will.
We won't let them. Won't let them.
How many curtain calls did you take tonight?
Six. Six curtains.
- That's pretty good for a drama.
- Yeah.
- Did you make a speech?
- Mm-hm. I thanked them for us.
I said, "My mother thanks you...
...my father thanks you...
...my sister thanks you...
...and I thank you.
Well...
...it was a good combination, Sam, worked well for a long time.
Yeah, now that it's all over, who was the senior partner...
...and who was the junior partner?
You mean, who was Dietz and who was Goff?
Well, I bet it's the first firm in the history of show business had two senior partners.
Well, uh, you know how I feel, don't you, Sam?
Sure. I understand.
You know, when Dad died, with him went the last link with The Four Cohans.
All the backslapping and the applause, well, it became unimportant.
No more fun in it.
It didn't mean anything anymore with Dad, Mom and Josie gone.
So Mary and I are going away and enjoy ourselves...
...and visit places we've always wanted to see...
...old theaters where nobody ever even heard of us.
You'll have to go to Timbuktu.
We've got it booked.
George, you've always been the one with the words.
I never was much of a hand at saying things.
But we've done more than make a lot of money...
...and lose a little.
Sometimes friends drift apart.
Let's not let that happen to us.
No matter how legal the dissolution of this partnership is, Sam...
...50 percent of me will always be here in this office.
I'll remember that when the rent comes due.
You'll be more successful than ever.
But if ever the rent does come due and you can't meet it, well, you know...
...and by the same token, if I get stuck in Madagascar...
Heh-heh. ...you'll hear from me.
You'd better get out of here.
That ship will sail without you.
- Seasick pills.
- Mm-hm.
I won't go to the boat with you.
You know how red my nose gets.
What's this? We thought you guys weren't speaking to each other.
Can we have a picture of you tearing up your contract?
That's impossible.
We never had a written contract.
The only contract we've ever had.
Hold that pose. We want to show it to our legal department.
Shoot it, boys.
Life was less full, but it was by no means empty.
I still had Mary, a playmate as well as a helpmate.
We set out to rubberneck at the world.
Nelson monument. It's a good thing
I wasn't born an Englishman.
With the history their flag has,
I'd have waved myself to death.
Oh, George,
I didn't know you could yodel.
Learned it on the farm.
Nothing but hog-calling with frost on it.
It takes two men to impersonate a horse on Broadway.
And you always have trouble casting the front end.
But folks always come back to where their heart is...
...so we came back to the farm...
...the farm we Cohans had dreamed of when farmers were envying us.
Hey, mister, our radiator needs some H20.
Can we use your well?
Sure, go ahead. Help yourselves.
Come on, Jack.
Let's make this hop-up solid.
Okay, Jackson, come on.
This isn't any free jitney.
Radiator busted?
Nah. It's only got high blood pressure.
What are you gonna do about tires if those give out?
Oh, it'll run a lot smoother on the rims.
"Stix nix hix pix."
Greek. I'll bet that's Greek talk.
That ain't Greek. That's Swedish or Russian. Stix nix hix pix.
That's show business talk.
Here, I'll translate it for you.
"Stix," small towns, "nix," refuse,
"hix," rube, "pix," pictures.
"Small towns refuse rube pictures."
Stix nix hix pix.
- Stix nix hix pix.
- Stix nix hix pix.
A-stix a-nix hix a-pix
A-stix a-nix hix pix
- I thought that was new jive talk.
- New what talk?
- Jive talk.
- Oh.
- Are you an actor, sir?
- Used to be.
- What were some of your pictures?
- Not in pictures.
I was on Broadway in the legitimate theater.
Oh. What's your name, sir?
- Cohan.
- Cohen?
Cohan. George M. Cohan.
- You must have been before our time.
- Yes, guess I was.
Were you ever in some big shows?
- Yeah, a few.
- Like what?
Oh, uh, like, uh,
Little Nellie Kelly.
- The Tavern. Ah, Wilderness!
- Uh-uh.
Mmm. Raised in a vacuum bottle.
Well, I guess your parents must have seen me, uh, fathers and mothers.
Maybe they have. I never heard them talk about it.
Have you ever heard a song called, uh,
"Give My Regards to Broadway"?
- I don't think so.
- Mmm. No, sir. Who sang it?
- Who sang it?
- Oh, was it a theme song or something?
- Did that follow "Beat Me Daddy, 8 to the Bar"?
- Yes! Or "Jeepers Creepers."
Jeepers creepers
Where'd you get those peepers?
Jeepers creepers
Where'd you get those eyes?
Come on, kids. Time's a-wasting.
Well, we gotta scram now.
Swinging session.
Thank you very much, mister...
What was your name again?
Cohan. George Cohan.
Good-bye, Georgie.
You're cute!
Nice old guy. We gotta get to that session, let's go.
Come on, we got places to go and things to do.
Bye!
They did that.
I'm not angry, but it is very discouraging.
Kid asked me my name, and I said Cohan.
He asked me again, and I said Cohan.
Hm. Never even heard of me. Sixteen years old, and I bet you he can't read.
But you've been away from that theater for years, George. Years.
Nine or 10 generations have grown up since then.
Naturally, they don't remember you.
Nobody's got that good a memory.
Why not? Many generations remembered my father and mother in vaudeville.
That's because they were real troupers.
They stayed with it.
Your father could do a buck-and-wing when he was 60 years old.
- What makes you think I can't?
- I'd hate to see you try it.
Your father never sat around an orchard listening to his arteries hardening.
- Nothing the matter with my arteries.
- No, not right now...
...because those kids got you all worked up.
You're picking on me for a reason, Mary.
You're trying to get a rise out of me.
Come on, let's have it. What is it?
All right. Here it is.
I got a long-distance call from
Sam Harris this afternoon.
What about?
He's producing a new show by Kaufman and Hart.
They're good writers.
Nothing I could do to improve their stuff.
Sam thinks you could, if you played the lead.
Play the lead? Now, what is the matter with that man?
Hasn't he got any sense at all?
What's he trying to do, spoil our fun?
But are you having fun, George?
When we were in Europe, you haunted every theater...
...not knowing a word that was said onstage.
Going back, congratulating the actors...
They didn't even know what you were talking about.
...Just to smell that greasepaint again.
You think I'm stagestruck.
The only reason I ever go near a theater is to get out of the night air.
Fun? I'm having a wonderful time.
I have nothing to do with Broadway.
Sam says it's a great part, no other actor in the world but you could do it.
That's just some more of that Harris con.
He needs me about as much as he needs a hole in the head.
He really does need you, George.
He's in trouble.
If positions were reversed, he'd help you out. You know he would.
Besides, he never said so, but Sam's broke.
Can you think of any more reasons?
Yes. I want you to.
Well, that settled it.
I've never refused you anything, have I?
We do it. Come on, let's get packing.
We're all packed.
What?
We're all packed, dear.
Now you can start getting mad all over again...
...because I told Sam
I'd talk you into it.
What are you laughing about?
Just full of news, aren't you?
Telling me all kinds of things, huh?
Well, I want you to know
I knew it all the time.
I was listening in on the phone downstairs while you were talking to Sam.
Why, you devil.
You knew it all the time!
And what's more, I phoned Sam right back and told him I'd play it.
Oh, I ought to pop you.
- You... You...
- Heh-heh-heh. Oh!
- Oh.
- Oh.
It's really a wonderful job
For fellows like George,
Abe and me too
It's great to shake hands with a mob
And to hold every kid on your knee too
Every word that I speak
Goes into headlines
When I speak
All the papers hold their deadlines
But I have found a way
Of dropping a hint
Or a glint of the truth
That the boys cannot print
For instance
For instance
When I was courting Eleanor
I told her Uncle Teddy
I wouldn't run for president
Unless the job was steady
Don't print it
Strictly off the record
We entertained the royalty
But we were never flustered
We gave them Yankee hot dogs
With Colman's English Mustard
Don't print it
Strictly off the record
It's pleasant at the White House
But I'll tell you how I feel
The food is simply terrible
Just sauerkraut and veal
If Mrs. R. would stay at home
I'd get a decent meal
But that's off the record
When I go up to Hyde Park
It's not for just the ride there
It's not that I like Hyde Park
But I love to park and hide there
Don't print it
It's strictly off the record
I sit up in my study
Writing gags for Mr. Ickes
And insults for the gentlemen
Who'd love to slip him Mickeys
Don't print that
Off the record
I scrapped the Prohibition Act
When we required a bracer
And finished up the Boulder Dam
To give the boys a chaser
Don't print it
It's strictly off the record
And for my friends in Washington
Who complain about the taxes
Who cares as long as we can knock
The ax out of the Axis?
Don't print it
It's strictly off the record
I can't forget how Lafayette
Helped give us our first chance
To win our fight for liberty
And now they've taken France
We'll take it back from Hitler
And put ants in his Ja-pants
And that's for the record
Good work, kids. I'll see you at 11 in the morning.
And then came your wire, and I was really worried.
Well, here I am going on like Tennyson's book, giving you the story of my life.
I'm sorry. You should've stopped me.
Why, I wanted to hear the story of your life.
It has a direct bearing on my sending for you.
Do you know what this is?
The Congressional Medal of Honor.
Let's see what the inscription says.
I congratulate you, Mr. Cohan.
I understand you're the first person of your profession to receive this honor.
You should be very proud.
Oh, I am proud.
In fact, I'm flabbergasted.
First time in my life,
I'm speechless.
Uh... You're sure there isn't some mistake?
Quite sure.
This medal is for people who've given their lives for their country or done something big.
I'm just a song-and-dance man.
Everybody knows that.
A man may give his life to his country in many different ways, Mr. Cohan.
And quite often, he isn't the best judge of how much he has given.
Your songs were a symbol of the American spirit.
"Over There" was just as powerful a weapon as any cannon...
...as any battleship we had in the first World War.
Today, we're all soldiers.
We're all on the front.
We need more songs to express America.
I know you and your comrades will give them to us.
Mr. President, I've just begun to earn this medal.
It's quite a thing.
Well, it's the best material we could find, what with priorities and all.
Good-bye, sir.
And I want you to know that I'm not the only one that's grateful.
My mother thanks you, my father thanks you...
...my sister thanks you, and I assure you, I thank you.
And, uh, I wouldn't worry about this country if I were you.
We've got this thing licked.
Where else could a plain guy like me come in and talk things over with the head man?
Well, that's about as good a definition of America...
...as any I've ever heard.
Good-bye, Mr. Cohan, and good luck.
Good-bye, sir, and good luck to you.
Over there
Over there
Send the word, send the word
Over there
That the Yanks are coming
The Yanks are coming
The drums rum-tumming everywhere
So prepare
Say a prayer
Send the word, send the word
To beware
We'll be over
We're coming over
And we won't come back
Till it's over
What's the matter, old-timer?
Don't you remember this song?
Seems to me I do.
Well, I don't hear anything.
Send the word over there
That the Yanks are coming
The Yanks are coming
The drums rum-tumming everywhere
So prepare
Say a prayer
Send the word, send the word
To beware
We'll be over
We're coming over
And we won't come back
Till it's over over there
Happy holiday
- Merry Christmas, bud.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas to you.
Okay. Hi, Chief.
Come in.
Hello, honey.
Well, this is our last night in show business.
Some feeling, huh?
Some feeling.
I got the ring and the license.
- Honey, we're ready.
- Oh.
Say, there's a hook leftover at the top here.
Should that be?
Never mind, I'll take care of it.
- Jim?
- Huh?
Well, I think that tie's terrible.
Well, who cares?
Tomorrow I'm a farmer.
You'd better go change it.
Listen, honey, when you're flipping those twinkle toes who's gonna be looking at my tie?
You only have five minutes. Hurry.
Okay, I'm on my way.
What'd he say?
I didn't tell him.
Why not? We love each other.
You wanna continue dancing.
I know, but he gets a look.
Oh, he's always had that look.
It doesn't mean anything emotionally.
It has something to do with his liver.
Simply tell him you had made a mistake.
You don't wanna give up your career and live on a farm.
But he's already bought the farm.
And the license, and the ring.
Oh, I can't tell him.
All right, I will.
Right after our number.
Listen, darling, don't weaken.
Think of our life together.
Think of diamonds, of sables, of your own little penthouse.
Is that a promise?
Well, just think about them for the time being.
Ready, Miss Dixon.
Well, thank you.
Say, this thing didn't come out even.
Oh, I'll fix it. We have to hurry.
I love you.
I love you... and Jim.
I love Jim, too. But after all,
I mean, let's not be too chummy.
Here she comes down the street
My, oh my, ain't she sweet?
Why, here comes my hot toddy
Over my dead body
I'll capture her heart singing
Just wait until she gets a load of my dancing
Just wait till I start singing
I'll take her strolling down the road with my dancing
I can't go wrong, a tender song
And she'll discover my charms
Some fancy taps and she'll collapse
And fall right into my arms
I'll capture her heart singing
Oh, no, you haven't a chance
When I go into my dance
I'll take you through life singing
I'll make you my wife dancing
If you could dance instead of sing
I'd learn to love you somehow
If you could sing instead of dance
I'd take you home with me now
The way you sing don't mean a thing
You'd better stick to your dance
And as for you, your dance won't do
You'll have to sing for romance
I'll capture her heart...
- Singing
- Dancing
Not much of a Christmas present for you, is it?
I mean, both of us walking out on you.
Don't worry about me, kid.
I'll do all right.
Whata chum.
Can't you see what we're walking out on? The grind.
365 days a year.
When's the last time you had as day off?
I don't know. Maybe last year?
Do you ever hear of Thanksgiving or Labor Day or the Fourth of July?
- Vaguely.
- You know what they are, don't you?
They're holidays.
Days of rest. There's lots of 'em.
They mark 'em in red on the calendar so you can't miss 'em.
What happens in show business when a holiday comes along?
You give an extra performance.
Not for me, brother.
Lila and I are going up to that farm in Connecticut and we're gonna live by the calendar.
- Say, Jim?
- Mmm?
There's something you should know.
Oh, I know, Ted. I feel the same way about you.
You know, we've had our ups and our downs and we fought a little over the women we swiped from each other, but...
- I know, but...
- Sorry, Jimmy boy, but that's life.
Ted, if I'm not the best manager in the business
I'll eat a garage mechanic's shirt.
Fifteen weeks at the Park Club, sight unseen, for you and Lila.
$200 a week more than you were getting with the farmer thrown in.
What's the matter?
I haven't told him.
- You haven't told him?
- You haven't told him?
Haven't told me what? What...
What's this? What's the news?
Well, don't be upset, Jim, dear.
It isn't that I don't love you. I do.
I love everybody, but when Ted explained how much he loved me and...
All at once, we both realized that we belong together.
The two of us, dedicating our lives to making people happy with our feet.
The two of you, huh?
Dedicating your lives to making people happy with your feet.
That's sweet.
Well, I guess that kick I just got was a good start, huh?
Sorry, Jimmy boy, but that's life.
Yeah, it's best that you found out now, Jim.
You wouldn't wanna make Lila unhappy.
Oh, no. No, I... I wouldn't want to make Lila unhappy.
Not now, now that I really know her.
What a narrow squeak that was.
What do you mean by that?
Oh, nothing. Nothing, honey.
I'm just happy that you're happy.
That little speech sounds like the crack of a confederate money.
Well, kids, I'm still gonna rejoin the human race.
I hope you get a lot of work, holidays included, dance yourselves into beautiful nervous breakdowns.
You ever want to look me up, you know where to find me,
Midville, Connecticut, under a large shady tree, just being lazy.
Lazy, I want to be lazy
I long to be out in the sun
With no work to be done
Under that awning
They call the sky
Stretching and yawning
And let the world go drifting by
I want to peep
Through the deep
Tangled wildwood
Counting sheep till I sleep
Like a child would
With a great big valise full
Of books to read where it's peaceful
While I'm killing time
Being lazy
So Lazy Acres was a snare and a delusion, huh?
Oh, brother, there's the hardest work in the world.
Maybe you'd be happier back in town, Jim.
Of course, if you get that agricultural urge again, you can always raise a geranium.
Oh, no. Wait till you hear.
I think I've dreamed up the greatest idea I ever had.
And you've had some pips.
Oh, but this can't miss.
I'm turning the farm into an inn, but what an inn.
Here, read up, brother.
"Holiday Inn, Midville Connecticut."
- Open holidays only?
- Mmm-hmm.
Say, how many of those are there?
There's about 15.
That gives me 350 days a year to kick around in.
He would think of that.
Did you get your discharge papers from that sanitarium?
Oh, don't you worry, this is gonna work.
I'm having auditions out at the farm every day.
Say, if you run into any talent that's willing to work for a share of the table, will you send them out?
Sure, soon as I get back.
I'm flying down to
Miami Beach tonight to set an engagement for Ted and Lila.
Lila.
You forgot to order the flowers.
Now, don't get excited, there's a flower shop out at the airport.
I guarantee to have orchids in her dressing room before her first number.
Oh, boy, you better.
As I remember, this kid even expects presents on Father's Day.
Yeah.
Well, good luck, Jim.
So long, Ted. Have a nice trip.
I mean, yeah, thanks, I will.
That reminds me,
I forgot to give him a little
Christmas remembrance
I brought along.
Got one here for each of you.
Say, this is swell.
What is it?
It's homemade peach preserves.
I put them up myself, just before
I went into the sanitarium.
Boy, do I go for those.
Why, they're great on...
Or even plain.
They're non-fattening, too.
Well, it's a long trip back to the farm, I think I'll get along.
Will you say hello to Lila for me?
But you gotta wait and catch the act.
We got some new routines and then after the show...
I don't think they like this nightclub air.
Wait. Wait. You better wait for Lila's.
I think Danny's was the loudest.
Well, different tone.
Dawn patrol, huh?
Hello! Am I too late?
You would have been in another minute.
Danny Reed.
Listen, I have to wait on that man.
- But...
- I'll work five nights for you. Anything.
Just leave me alone and don't butt in.
What would you like?
Orchids, the finest you've got.
Corsage?
No. No. A dozen.
Loose, looking like they don't care.
All right.
There, "Lila, love, Ted."
Have them delivered to Miss Lila Dixon at the Club Pierre before 11:00 tonight.
Oh, I'm sorry, but our delivery truck is on its last trip and won't be back until after 11:00.
How about a messenger boy?
Oh, it's impossible to guarantee delivery this late on Christmas Eve.
But to help you out, I'll take them.
Oh, there you are.
A dozen orchids, please.
Lady, you're a lifesaver.
Here. Here's $5. Take your boyfriend out and show him a good time.
Oh, thank you, but let's consider this a personal favor.
Well, I can't leave town indebted to a stranger.
Would you like to see the floor show at the club tonight?
Oh, I'd like to very much, but...
All right, now you just give this card to Francois and he'll seat you at the entertainer's table.
Why, you're Mr. Reed.
Uh-oh.
I'm Linda Mason. Well, this is just a part-time job.
Actually, I sing and dance.
Mr. Reed, I want...
I know. I know, you've studied dancing since you were a little child.
You spent long weary hours in every theatrical agency in Broadway.
But just now I happen to be catching a plane to...
Of course, once you told me I was no good,
I could probably get a job at a bargain basement and like it.
Now look, honestly, as soon as I get...
Oh, of course. Sure, you worked hard, you want a chance.
So what? So I'm gonna give it to you.
- A job?
- Uh-huh.
A friend of mine is opening a place in Connecticut, Holiday Inn.
You take that card out there tomorrow, tell him I sent you and you'll be all set.
Mr. Reed, how could
I possibly thank you?
Don't. Just deliver those orchids and let me catch my plane.
This table's reserved for the band.
Excuse me!
Fussy, isn't he?
I think I'll have a bowl of coffee, huh?
- And the lady?
- Coffee.
We seem to be on the
40-cent tour here.
It is embarrassing.
I'm Jim Hardy.
Linda Mason.
Got a friend in the show?
Well, I'm here at
Mr. Reed's invitation.
Oh, Danny.
Then you know Ted Hanover.
What?
Yes, naturally.
Oh, my.
He's quite a man with the ladies, that Ted.
Well, after all, he's a very attractive man.
Do you know him?
Oh, yes. Yes.
Matter of fact,
I've been considering Ted and his partner for my new club.
Oh, you have a place.
Oh, yes. Yes.
I don't know, though.
His act might not go so well at a place as large as mine.
Oh.
Well, I've found that the size of a place doesn't matter, if one has sufficient personality.
That's what you found, huh?
You in show business?
I'm Linda Mason.
Oh, Linda Mason.
I could dance nightly
Just holding you tightly
My sweet
I could keep right on
Because you're so light on your feet
You're easy to dance with
There is no doubt in
The way we stand out in the crowd
Though it's called dancing
To me it's romancing out loud
You're easy to dance with
Loving you the way I do
Makes you easy to dance with
That is why I'm always right on the beat
All those charms in one man's arms
Make you easy to dance with
I can hardly keep my mind on my feet
Let's dance forever
Come on, say we'll never be through
It's so easy to dance with you
You're easy to dance with
You're easy to dance with
It's so easy to dance with you
It's so easy to dance
It's so easy to dance
With you
That was wonderful.
Oh, it's a great act, isn't it? Here they come.
- Who?
- Ted and Lila.
Hey, what's the matter?
- Hello, Lila.
- Jimmy boy.
- How are you?
- I'm so glad to see you.
It's good to see you.
I thought you were alone, Jim.
Who's your friend, and what's her hurry?
Don't ask me, she's your friend.
- Mine?
- Yeah.
What is she afraid of? Facing me?
Darling, I swear, I never...
"Darling, I swear."
You lie...
You're on.
So this is Holiday Inn.
Yeah. Will be if it ever opens up.
Well, why shouldn't it open?
Well, I ain't one to talk, but you could probably buy a half interest in this place for a barrel of apples.
Next train for New York's at
7:43, if I can flag her down.
Say, I'm looking for a job.
Where's the boss?
Right here, I'll be down in a second.
So, you're the big shot that didn't know whether
Hanover and Dixon were good enough for your place.
Well, that wasn't exactly hay you were throwing, either.
"I'm Linda Mason."
Merry Christmas.
All right, you're a fake and I'm a phony.
And we're both soaked.
- Are you hurt?
- I'll check later.
Come on, let's get out of this before you catch cold.
All right. Ooh.
Well, here's what cooks.
Oh.
Well, this is darling.
Was it as large as this when it was a farmhouse?
Yeah, it was built by a fellow who felt cramped in New York.
He finally ran out of lumber, though.
Oh, Mamie.
Coming.
Is your names Mamie?
- No.
- No.
Get back in the kitchen.
My, my. What's happened?
Oh, we had a little accident.
- Mamie, this is Miss Linda Mason.
- How do you do?
Please to know you, Miss Linda.
And these are her children.
That's Daphne, and that's Vanderbilt.
How do you do?
Mamie, will you take Miss
Mason up to the guest room and change her into anything that'll fit her while we get her clothes dry, huh?
Sure thing, Mr. Jimmy.
Come on, honey.
I'll see about getting the fire ready in the living room.
Is your names Miss Linda?
- No.
- No.
I don't know, it sounds like something you dream about at night and it would be wonderful, then you'd wake up in the morning and realize it couldn't work.
Oh, it'll work, if I can sell the idea to some performers.
They seem to think that profit sharing means taking bows on an empty stomach.
So that's why you're not open tonight.
Well, I'm also, sort of, particular about the kind of talent I'm gonna use.
Fifteen holidays a year.
Mmm-hmm.
You're a lazy fellow.
No, not especially.
Just have my own ideas about living.
My father was like you.
Just a man with a family.
Never amounted to much, didn't care.
But as long as he was alive we always had plenty to eat and clothes to keep us warm.
- Were you happy?
- Yes.
Then your father was a very successful man. Hope I can do as well.
Say, I came out here for a job. Could you use me?
Well, I might find a spot for you in my first show. What can you do?
I sing a little and dance.
Couldn't guarantee any salary at first, right now I've got the ledger and an iron lung.
I don't care if you pay off in eggs, just give me a chance.
Well, let's see what you can do.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
You know, I've written special music for each holiday.
This sort of gives me a chance to keep a little promise I made to myself.
I said I was gonna sing this song at the inn tonight.
I'm dreaming
Of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming
Of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases
Be white
I'm dreaming
Of a white Christmas
Just like...
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten.
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen.
And children listen
To hear
Sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry
And bright
And may all your
Christmases
Be white
Happy holiday
Happy holiday
While the merry bells keep ringing
May your every wish come true
Happy holiday
May the calendar keep bringing
Happy holidays to you
If you're burdened down with trouble
If your nerves are wearing thin
Park your load down the road
And come to Holiday Inn
If the traffic noise affects you
Like a squeaky violin
Kick your cares down the stairs
And come to Holiday Inn
If you can't find somebody who
Would set your heart a-whirl
Get in your car and motor to
The home of boy meets girl
If you're laid-up with a breakdown
Throw away your vitamin
Don't get worse
Grab your nurse
And come to Holiday Inn
Happy holiday
May the calendar keep bringing
Happy holidays to you
Happy New Year, Ted.
No!
Francois, have you seen Mr. Hanover?
Twice, sir.
What happened?
The first time, sir, he came from his dressing room with a telegram in his hand.
He ordered Scotch and soda, a bottle of each.
I know, I know. What then?
The second time he came from his dressing room he asked which way is Connecticut.
- Connecticut?
- Connecticut.
He said he has a friend there who knows about women, too.
Why didn't you stop him?
How could I stop him, sir, when I don't know which way is Connecticut.
Who said Holiday Inn wouldn't work?
Well, we're gonna divvy up a stack of important money tonight, huh?
Man, man.
I've got a landlady who's gonna ask for your autographed picture.
No.
Everybody get something?
All right, come on, now.
Go to bed, now, it's getting late.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Look, it's almost time.
Say, it's practically straight up, isn't it?
One minute to midnight
One minute to go
One minute to say good-bye
Before we say hello
Let's start the new year right
Twelve o'clock tonight
When they dim the light
Let's begin
Kissing the old year out
Kissing the new year in
Let's watch the old year die
With a fond good-bye
And our hopes as high
As a kite
How can our love go wrong if
We start the new year right?
That's it. That's midnight.
I'll see you out on the floor, all right?
All right.
Come on, everybody. Happy New Year.
Happy holiday.
Happy New Year.
I forgot my check.
You won't need that, but I think you'll need your coat.
Happy New Year.
Same to you.
You got to dance.
Oh, you got to dance.
Come on, you got to...
Why, Mr. Hanover.
Mr. Hanover.
That's Mr. Hanover.
Wait a minute, I got to go.
Oh, no, I don't want Ted Hanover,
I want you. This is New Years, kid.
I know.
Ted!
He wasn't drunk, it's a gag.
What happened?
Ted Hanover with his new partner.
They were great.
New partner?
You better get back.
Well, I am sorry, if I'd have known how he was...
Oh, he'll be all right in a week or 10 days. You better hurry.
Ted!
Ted!
Ted!
Oh.
How is he?
He's out cold.
Hot or cold, he can keep his dancing shoes in my office.
Did you hear that applause?
Yeah, it went pretty good.
And I was worried about his losing Lila.
- Losing Lila?
- Yeah.
Yeah, she eloped tonight with some Texan from Texas, with Ted's engagement ring on her finger.
But who cares?
You lose one girl, you find another. That's life.
That's good, huh?
Here we go again.
Come in.
- Good morning, Ted.
- Oh. Good morning.
Got a little head?
Where am I?
You're at Holiday Inn.
Well, how did I get here?
Who brought me?
You were clinging to the undercarriage of a jeep, I think.
Here, have a slug out of the mug.
- You mean you don't remember anything?
- Uh...
Let's see. I had a wire from Lila telling me she's going to marry some millionaire or something.
- I remember that all right.
- Mmm-hmm.
Then I had a drink.
A drink?
Boy, you were fractured.
And then I decided I had to talk to my old pal, Jim.
You don't remember anything else?
No. That's all, except that
I must have been killed on the way out here or something.
You really come up empty, huh?
Too bad about Lila.
I think you're better off doing a single.
You're a born soloist, you know.
Oh, no, no, Jim, I've got to have a partner.
And when I find her...
Yeah, I know, you'll fall in love with her.
- You haven't missed yet.
- Happy New Year!
Oh, don't do that.
Why didn't you tell me?
Letting me beat my brains out worrying about his losing Lila and all the time, he's got this girl on the leash.
What girl?
Boy, you must have been high.
Doing a complete dance routine with your new partner and you...
You don't know who she is?
I danced with a new partner?
When? Where?
Here. Last night.
Think, Ted. Remember?
Wait a minute. I remember.
I got here just about midnight.
There was a girl.
We danced.
What she look like?
I... I don't know. All I saw was a vague outline.
Can't you remember anything about her?
I remember dancing with her.
If I ever dance with her again,
I'd probably recognize her.
Great, that takes care of everything but finding her.
You were here, why ask me how she looked?
I only saw her from the back. She was...
About this...
She had a...
If I ever saw her from the back again, I'd recognize her.
Well, that's fine.
After I've danced with her,
I'll just turn her around for your okay.
This should be a cinch.
You saw her, describe her.
Who, me? Well, I wasn't watching very closely.
She was a medium...
Medium-built sort of a girl, with a medium face. She had a nice evening gown on with a belt in the back.
See, she was built just like a girl friend of mine.
A girl you don't know but her name was Consuela Stupkis.
She used to play the pinball machine a lot down at the corner drugstore.
I remember one time she was high man. Three weeks in a row.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
That's nothing at all, happy to do it.
See, I got a hunch, fellas.
I've got a hunch we're going to find this girl eventually.
And when we do we'll be glad we waited for her.
Listen, I'm not interested in getting any other partner, understand?
A chance meeting in the night. Destiny.
She'll be back.
Here's where we will find her on the next holiday.
- Here?
- Here.
I've got to go turn the roast.
Now don't worry, we'll find her.
If I see her from the back again,
I'll recognize her.
It's kind of a roundabout way to go at it, but let's try it.
Are you decent?
Yes, come in.
What's that?
Well, I thought it over and I believe that our number'll go a little better in blackface.
Oh. I thought we were going to do it like this.
Well, that's before...
Before I thought it over.
- I look terrible in the stuff.
- No.
I don't even know how to put it on.
I'll put it on for you.
I broke in as a bootblack, you know.
Here we go.
Oh.
For a month and a half
I've been dreaming of how pretty I was going to look tonight.
Well, here's my punishment for thinking so well of myself.
Oh, you'll have plenty of times to be pretty.
I was just going to ask you if you'd like to be in the rest of the shows out here.
You were?
- Will you?
- Will I?
Fifteen nights a year Cinderella steps into her pumpkin coach and becomes queen of Holiday Inn.
Well, what's the matter?
I wish I didn't have to work all the other days in the year to make these few possible.
Maybe a little later on when we start doing better you could stay out here all the time.
Did you hear what you just said?
Yeah.
Was it a proposal?
It will be when I get a few bucks in the bank.
You're a strange duck.
You don't even give me a chance to say darling and throw my arms around you.
Better save that till you see the bankbook.
Well, I guess I'm sort of engaged.
Say, what is this? A daisy chain?
Well, we were just looking for the back of a girl we don't know.
Upon a February morn
A tiny baby boy was born
Abraham
Abraham
When he growed up, this tiny babe
Folks all called him Honest Abe
Abraham
Abraham
In 1860, he became
The sixteenth president
And now he's in the hall of fame
A most respected gent
That's why we celebrate
This blessed February date
Abraham
Abraham
When black folks lived in slavery
Who was it set the darkie free?
Abraham
That's right, child.
Abraham
When troubles come down from the shelf
Who's heart was bigger than hisself?
Abraham
Yeah, ma'am!
Abraham
The country's going to the dogs
They shouted loud and strong
Then from a cabin made out of logs
The right man came along
And that is why we celebrate
This blessed February date
Abraham
The U.S.A.'s united thanks
Yeah
To one whose name was Nancy Hanks
Tell me!
Abraham
She gave this land the finest son
That's what she did.
Who ever went to Washington
Who dat?
Abraham
Abraham
When someone told him General Grant
Was drinking every night
He answered, "Go see if you can't
"Get all my generals tight"
That's why we celebrate
This blessed February date

Good night.
I give up. She's not here tonight.
You wait here, I'll go up and see if Jim's seen her.
Gus is waiting to take you to the station.
Remember now, day after tomorrow,
St. Valentine's Day.
Someone's coming, we better use the other stairway.
- Who is it?
- Bill-collector.
- Good night.
- Good night, Jim.
You better get inside before you catch cold. You haven't got a coat.
- Well, I...
- Go on.
I don't need a coat now.
Hey, Ted. Did you find the girl?
This is terrible, I wish we could recognize her from the front.
I feel like a wolf.
Why, Ted.
Ted!
- She's here!
- Who?
- I saw her!
- This way.
Let go of my coat.
This way, shortcut, shortcut. Come on.
Giddyap.
It's locked, it's never been locked before.
Let's try the other stairwell.
Let go of me, let go.
Go ahead.
Well, we've lost her again.
Did you get a look at her face this time?
No, we're still working from the rear.
How do you know it was her?
After all, she had an overcoat on.
I don't care if she had...
How do you know she had an overcoat on?
Well, she... If she didn't, look for a girl with pneumonia.
Come on. Let's get inside.
Say, Jim, when's your next show?
Next show? St. Valentine's
Day, I think.
- Day after tomorrow, huh?
- Is it?
That's our break.
We'll get here bright and early and stay until we find her.
We'll make an announcement asking her to identify herself.
- We won't miss next time.
- No.
Say, fellas, how did you like the show?
Well, we were so busy we didn't see much of it, Jim. Why?
I thought the people seemed to like the blackface routine.
Yeah, they did.
Don't you think a blackface number on St. Valentine's
Day would be novel?
- A what?
- It's no good, eh?
Just an idea I had.
Well, good-bye.
- Good-bye, Ted.
- So long, Jim.
Bye, Dan.
- Hey, lady.
- Yes.
You know we open in an hour.
You haven't even had a rehearsal.
Coming.
Oh, very smart.
You'll have to talk Gus into buying a horseless carriage.
I spend half my life between here and the station.
I think Gus will have to face the machine age sooner or later, won't he?
Did you escape those bill-collectors the other night?
Bill-collectors?
Oh, yes, temporarily.
Say, that reminds me,
I have a surprise for you downstairs.
Well, thanks. What reminds you?
Nothing, it's just... I mean,
I want you to remember the surprise when those doggone bill-collectors move in.
You sound sweet, but you don't make sense.
The inn is so romantic looking.
Nice? I posed for those cupids myself.
Hello, boys.
Hi. How are you?
Paid-up cards here tonight.
Where's the surprise?
Aha! Right here, a little home cooking I whipped up.
Beautiful.
"Be Careful, It's My Heart."
And I ain't kidding, either.
I wrote this just for you, honey.
Be careful, it's my heart
It's not my watch you're holding, it's my heart
It's not the note I sent you
That you quickly burned
It's not the book I lent you
That you never returned
Remember, it's my heart
The heart with which so willingly I part
It's yours to take, to keep or break
But please, before you start
Be careful, it's my heart
Be careful, it's my heart
It's not my watch you're holding, it's my heart
It's not the note I sent you
That you quickly burned
It's not the book I lent you
That you never returned
Remember, it's my heart
The heart with which so willingly I part
It's yours to take, to keep or break
But please, before you start
Be careful, it's my heart
I'm sorry, Jim, I couldn't resist it.
Wonderful, she's prefect, light as a feather.
You found her, Jim. You're a pal.
Yeah.
Young lady, do you realize that we've been searching for you for weeks?
- For me?
- Yes, ever since...
The girl in the flower shop.
Yes, Mr. Reed.
Where have you been working since New Year's Eve?
Here.
Would you mind letting me in on your secret?
Oh, it's no secret.
Ted Hanover is looking for a new dancing partner and we've decided to give you the job.
Oh, here now. Wait, just a minute.
Oh, no hard feelings, Jim,
I don't blame you for trying.
She is wonderful.
I feel as if I've known her for months.
Oh. Same old feeling, huh?
Let's see, Washington's
Birthday is the next show.
That will give us a week of rehearsals.
We can open the act here.
I'll take care of the invitations.
Strictly formal.
I'll get all the newspaper boys from New York.
Now hold everything. This is my inn, and I am not running it for a bunch of stuffed shirts.
What would you like, the dungaree set?
Well, that would be better than the bunch of chowder heads you drag in.
Maybe I can't use the act.
Not use Ted Hanover?
Well, the show is pretty well set.
You're in, but he's out.
But you could change the show for a special occasion like this.
Of course he could. He's just trying to hide his gratitude.
Jim, you better think up a number for us.
Well, just what do you visualize, Ziggy?
Ah, let's see.
For Washington's birthday I see, sort of, a romantic costume thing.
- Naturally.
- Something that just reeks
- with grace and charm, you know?
- Mmm-hmm.
I think the music should be sweet and gentle to...
Well, to create the mood, each time
I take her into my arms and kiss her.
That's it.
Don't you think it's getting a little stuffy in here?
I could say that you're homely
Just as homely as pie
But this is Washington's birthday
And I've got to say you're beautiful
'Cause I can't tell a lie
I could say that you're stupid
Nothing up in your crown
But this is Washington's birthday
And the truthful he
Of the cherry tree
Would look down on me and frown
I could say that I hate you if I try
But I've got to say I love you
'Cause it's February the twenty-second
And I can't tell a lie
Hit it.
Come in.
Well, honey, in spite of what good old Jim tried to do to us, your future starts as of tonight.
Now where would you like to go from here?
- From here?
- Yes.
New York, Havana, Rio? We have our pick of engagements, you know.
But I can't be your partner if you leave the inn.
Of course you can. There's no reason for you to remain buried here.
There's a very good reason.
I promised to be in Jim's holiday shows for the rest of the year.
Ah, but he tricked you into that while he was hiding you from me.
No matter how he did it, I've promised.
Besides, well, we're going to be married.
Married? Now wait a minute, let's be fair.
He didn't give me a chance.
After all, I love you, too.
Linda, from the very first moment we danced together,
I knew you were to be the one girl in my life.
You didn't even know my name.
Please. All right, forget about me, then.
Forget about Jim, think of yourself.
Here's your chance to do the one thing you like best.
Not only for 15 days a year, but always.
Sorry, but I promised.
Well?
I guess I should apologize for hooking up your number, huh?
Oh, forget it. I'm the one that should apologize to you.
Here I've been trying to take Linda away from you not knowing you two were going to be married.
Married?
Yeah, aren't you?
Yes, sure.
I mean, naturally, we're sort of engaged.
Oh.
Well, anyway, I've decided to bow out of here. Linda's all yours.
Well, you're a pretty game guy to take it this way.
Well, it's happened so often I'm getting used to it, that's all.
Good-bye, kid.
A lot of luck, Ted.
Thanks.
How are we doing?
Two minutes ago, I would have sold my chances for a tired dime.
But when a man is surprised to hear that he's going to be married, brother, that's when I go to work with a clear conscience.
- Everything's good, huh?
- Everything is perfect.
In your Easter bonnet
With all the frills upon it
You'll be the grandest lady
In the Easter parade
I'll be all in clover
And when they look you over
I'll be the proudest fellow
In the Easter parade
On the Avenue
Fifth Avenue
The photographers will snap us
And you'll find that you're
In the rotogravure
Oh, I could write a sonnet
About your Easter bonnet
And of the girl I'm taking
To the Easter parade
On the Avenue
Fifth Avenue
The photographers will snap us
And you'll find that you're
In the rotogravure
Oh, I could write a sonnet
About your Easter bonnet
And of the girl I'm taking
To the Easter parade
Hello!
I didn't exactly expect the welcome mat, but I thought somebody might say hello.
- Hello.
- Thanks.
What brings you here on this bright and uninviting day?
I've discovered something, my friends, about life.
Meaning what?
Well, I don't want success,
I want the true happiness you people have found here at the inn.
You're not gonna stay in the inn?
Not just stay, I want to be part of your shows, help you in your work, share your simple pleasures.
I asked you once not to interfere, Ted.
Please believe me, I am a tired, lonely and unhappy man.
But I could be happy here, helping the two people I like the best.
Will you take me in?
My motherly intuition tells me to throw him out.
Well, at least give him the benefit of the doubt.
I've given him plenty of doubt.
Are you kidding with that "sharing life's simple pleasures"?
May I go inside with you?
Why, of course.
My... My trunks will arrive this afternoon.
What do I do?
Move in the broom closet?
Jim, that's no way to talk to a man who's here to help you.
The world doesn't change.
A gentle smile often breeds a kick in the pants.
But for your sake,
Linda, I'll be big.
I'll give you a tip about these things, Gus.
They'll go up and back, but not sideways.
Yeah, well, I keep forgetting this blind thing can't see where it's going.
Yeah, well, unload the rest of this stuff in the back, huh?
Hey! What did you do, get up before breakfast?
Why, every morning.
I trust you slept well.
When I found out how late you got in,
I told Mamie to let you sleep.
- Life on a farm!
- Can't beat it, huh?
Jim, you've made me very happy!
That's fine.
Now, how about you making me happy?
You sound like a landlord with eviction papers.
Oh. This is good news,
Lila's back in New York.
I got a letter from her yesterday.
What happened to her millionaire?
Slight mistake there.
He didn't own millions, he owed them.
Poor girl, always straying to greener pastures and finding spinach.
Say, she was wondering if you'd be interested in taking her back as a partner.
I think it'd be a great idea.
Naturally, you would.
But I like it here with you and Linda.
Yes, and we love having you, too.
Uh, when are you leaving?
- Why didn't you say something?
- You look so silly.
- Where's Jim?
- Inside.
Good. I've fixed it. Here's the news in one luscious word: Hollywood!
Now, I told you, I'm not leaving here until Linda goes with me.
But this is the setup you needed to get her away from Jim.
Now, there are going to be two
Hollywood men here tonight to see the show.
One's an important director.
If they like your dancing, you and Linda will be on a westbound train tomorrow.
We better find out if Linda's interested.
We let her know when there's a contract staring her in the face.
- Look...
- Now I know you're in love with the girl but forget her until we get her away from here.
This is no time to be honest.
Well, what should I do?
All we have to do is to convince Jim that he'd be a heel if he stood in the way of a chance like this.
Oh, that'll be easy, like peeling a turtle.
Mamie says these go up here!
Yes, set them right down.
Say, Gus, how would you like to earn a slow $10?
Well, I don't care how slow, but sure.
It's sure, all right, here's the wrinkle,
I want you to go down to the station pick up a party and start for Holiday Inn but never get here.
Could you handle that?
Wouldn't be surprised!
Hello, long distance.
That's what I want you to do with Linda Mason.
Miss Mason? Our friend?
You're not supposed to understand it, Gus.
For that kind of money you ought to be able to go by way of Medicine Hat.
Hello, yeah. Just a minute.
Long distance, I want to get Parkway Hotel,
New York City, Miss Lila Dixon.
Didn't Linda say she'd be here for final rehearsal?
Oh, relax, our audiences aren't professional critics.
Gus, you made a wrong turn.
Shortcut.
Gus!
Shortcut, another shortcut.
How could you possibly expect to drive through this?
Well, I never had no trouble with a horse.
Oh, you'd better carry me to shore, and I'll walk back to the highway.
Well, I think you'd be better off waiting right here.
Gus, will you please do as I say?
Oh, all right.
- The other way.
- Huh?
Turn around. Gus, turn around!
Oh!
Gus!
- My hat!
- You pushed me.
Get my hat!
I swear the show will start any minute now.
You said that an hour ago.
Yeah, but this time
I'm sincere. Excuse me.
Who started the show?
I did. You're on.
But what about Ted's partner?
You've kept this crowd waiting long enough, he can go on without her.
Have you gone nuts?
I've rehearsed a double dance.
Let's say it with firecrackers and banners held high
Let's have a real old-fashioned noisy Fourth of July
Let's say it with firecrackers
They'll jump at up North
Let's have the kind we used to call a glorious Fourth
Let's salute our native land
Roman candles in each hand
While a Yankee Doodle band
Gets hotter than a firecracker
Don't need any long speeches
Or shouts of "Hooray!"
No words can say as much as firecrackers can say
Freedom! Freedom!
Here comes the Freedom Man
On this day of independence
On this Independence Day
Listen to an American troubadour from the U. S.A.
I'm singing a song of freedom
For all people who cry out to be free
Free to sail the seven seas
Free to worship as we please
If the birds up in the trees
Can be free
Why can't we?
I'm bringing a song of freedom
To all people wherever they may be
Free to speak and free to hear
Free from want and free from fear
Sons of freedom far and near
Who agree
Sing with me
That all God's people shall be free
I'm singing a song of freedom
For all people who cry out to be free
Free to sail the seven seas
Free to worship as we please
If the birds up in the trees
Can be free
Why can't we?
I'm bringing a song of freedom
To all people wherever they may be
Free to speak and free to hear
Free from want and free from fear
Sons of freedom far and near
Who agree
Sing with me
That all God's people shall be free
That all God's people shall be free
Will you give me a lift?
Sure, hop in.
Aren't you Ted Hanover's former dancing partner?
Yes, although I wouldn't exactly say former.
I'm dancing with him at the inn tonight.
But I... Doesn't he have a new partner?
Oh, she won't be there tonight.
I didn't know that!
I work at the inn.
Oh?
Waitress?
Yes.
I know your boss, Jim Hardy, quite well. Quite well.
Then he's responsible for your rejoining Mr. Hanover.
Uh-huh.
By the way, if I were you,
I'd look my prettiest tonight when I'm waiting on tables.
Jim says there will be a couple of men from Hollywood to consider Ted and me for pictures.
And Mr. Hanover's other partner will be missing this chance to go to Hollywood.
Yes, although she can't be very talented or they wouldn't be working at the inn.
Ted and I played only the best places.
Listen, you're late for the show already, if you'd care to let me drive
I know a shortcut that'll get us there 15 minutes sooner.
There's a farmhouse near here and I'll have us towed out in a couple of minutes.
Oh, for the love of mud, hurry!
Wait right here!
What else can I do?
- You're on now.
- But Linda isn't here yet.
You've got to save the pieces, keep those men interested now and do a number with Linda later.
What can I do?
Well, fake something.
Fake something, okay.
There's your cue.
Don't fail me, keep them flying.
I'll keep them flying.
Linda! What happened to you?
A bad job of sabotage.
Excuse me!
Well, Jim, you deliberately kept me from working at the inn tonight, didn't you?
- Yeah.
- You knew there would be men here from Hollywood who might offer me a chance in pictures.
You've decided I shouldn't have that opportunity.
Not even the opportunity to refuse.
I was afraid the offer might be too important for you to turn down.
The point is you don't trust me to make my own decisions because they might interfere with your own selfish plans.
I've had about enough of that, Jim.
Ted, Linda!
Mr. Parker, Mr. Dunbar,
I want you to meet the greatest dance team in show business, Hanover and Mason.
And the owner Jim Hardy.
Glad to know you, Hardy.
Nice little place you've got here.
Gentlemen, even though you haven't seen
Miss Mason dance, I can assure you...
Hardy, Hollywood is always interested in new ideas and we think this is a honey.
Frankly, we'd like to do a picture based on the Holiday Inn.
The idea behind it, how it works, the special holiday songs.
Of course, it's purely a speculative thing, far from foolproof and we can't afford to pay too much.
You don't have to start talking it down because the idea is not for sale.
Well, maybe I haven't explained enough.
We expect to use Mr. Hanover and his partner in the picture.
Well, I don't know how the others feel but I'd like to keep this little setup just the way it is.
Jim, would you be decent just once and let somebody else around here have a chance?
Wait a minute, Danny, after all, the place belongs to him he can do as he wants.
I guess it was just too good to last, huh?
A simple little layout, where we could do our best at the work we know without having any illusions of glory.
I can see now that I'm the only one who could be happy here.
Go ahead, take the idea, take the music, take Linda, take the whole darn thing.
But what about you? We'll need you in Hollywood to write the rest of the music.
Oh, no, I work right here.
I'll send you the music when it's written.
And don't bother me before, huh?
Guess maybe I was a little selfish, huh?
Is that the deal you wanted or should I have thrown in my shirt?
Chummy sort of a fellow, isn't he?
Listen, Linda, if you really want to stay here...
Don't talk that way. This is the chance you wanted, isn't it?
Of course. Boy, are we happy!
Happy Thanksgiving, Mr. Jim.
Same to you, Mamie. And staff.
Didn't I tell you children to stay in the kitchen?
Those wings ain't going to fly away. Now shoo!
Everything's ready and hot, Mr. Jim.
Thank you, Mamie.
I've got plenty to be thankful for
Are you kidding?
I haven't got a great big yacht
To sail from shore to shore
Still I've got plenty to be thankful for
You're loaded, Dan.
I've got plenty to be thankful for
Like what?
No private car
No caviar
No carpet on my floor
Still I've got plenty to be thankful for
You know you're better off than I am.
I've got eyes to see with
You need glasses.
Ears to hear with
Or fly with.
Arms to hug with
Lips to kiss with
Someone to adore
You're a little flat, too.
How could anybody ask for more?
My needs are small I buy them all
At the five and ten cent store
Sing it!
Sing it pretty.
Oh, I've got plenty to be thankful for
Why, you ain't ate a bite.
I'm pouting, Mamie.
Who is this?
That's Mr. Jones.
Jonesey! I'm sorry,
I knew him too well.
But you got to eat.
The trouble ain't with that turkey, Mr. Jim, it's you!
I feel all right.
I'm riding high, Mamie.
Well, why you close the inn and sit around like a jellyfish with the misery?
'Cause a slicker stole your gal and you ain't got fight enough to get her back.
Excuse me, Mr. Jim.
I tried to keep her here!
What kind of keeping is that?
Nothing but tricks.
If you went to Hollywood and told Miss Linda how much you loves her, and misses her, and told her that the way a lady likes to hear it told,
I'll bet you she'd be the quickest ex-movie star that ever exed.
You're crazy, Mamie
I'm crazy? I knows Miss Linda.
I knows her like I knows my own kids.
Why, she ain't the fancy type no more than you are.
What she wants is what you got right here.
But women has to have them things told to them the right way.
You could melt her heart right down to butter, if you'd only turn on the heat.
Mamie, you don't try to take a fellow's gal away from him after he's bought the ring.
Or as I recall, do you?
Now you're talking!
Oh, sure, women has to be told things the right way.
Yes, sir!
At last, the night I've been dreaming about actually here.
This is still my wedding, you know.
You make me feel like a kibitzer.
Now don't misunderstand me,
I'm happy because this marriage means that we can all settle down and stop worrying.
I wish I had your confidence without your viewpoint.
My fingers are crossed until Linda and I are on that plane bound for Yuma.
Now what's worrying you?
I don't know, except I've been this close to marriage before only to wake up next morning and find myself with no bride and a hangover.
Look, the girl said yes, the picture finishes tonight, there's a judge waiting in Yuma.
Come in!
Everything is all set and ready.
What could possibly happen to...
Hi, fellows!
Jim, what brought you here?
Train. Chug chug chug chug.
The wedding, when is it?
- Wedding?
- Yeah.
Well, we hadn't set any exact time.
Have you seen Linda?
No, no, not yet. But, say,
I saw your director, he told me he was shooting the finale tonight, thought I'd like to see how you make pictures.
He wouldn't... You wouldn't like what they're doing tonight.
Why not?
Oh, no, that's dull, technical stuff.
Well, I'm a dull, technical sort of a fellow.
Perhaps if you'd wait and see Linda tomorrow.
Oh, no, I want to see the finish.
The success of you and Linda means a lot to me, pal.
Say, why don't you be yourself.
What are you up to?
Well, I'm a son of a gun.
This is a beautiful hunk of welcome for a guy who comes coast to coast just to wish you a merry
Christmas and a happy wedding.
You remember how I suspected you when you came to live at the inn on Easter morning?
Silly, wasn't it?
Now I know he's up to something.
Oh, wait a minute now let's not be unfair.
No?
No, we're treating Jim like a poor country cousin.
- He doesn't mean any harm!
- No!
No, he just wants to see Linda.
So let's show him Linda.
Goodwill on earth toward men.
This... Where we going? What's this?
Hey, Ted! What is this?
I was afraid you'd gone crazy.
I'll keep him in here till you get Linda on that plane.
I better hurry and get my clothes on.
Yeah, in the meantime
I'll go down to the set and see how near ready they are.
Wait a minute, my clothes are in there.
Merry Christmas!
Jim, pal! Wait!
Stop! We were only fooling!
Only you could think of a thing like that.
Who you calling?
Nobody, the operator's gone.
Take it easy. Don't break your neck.
It's one of the most authentic reproduction jobs we've ever done.
Is it?
And all worked out from those photographs we took of your place in Connecticut.
Uh-huh.
Well, Mamie and the kids ought to see this. They'd never believe it!
Anything wrong?
Well, that Christmas tree's a little out of place.
I'd guess nobody would notice that but me or Linda.
We're going to start rolling in a couple of minutes.
Come along with me where you can see everything.
No, I'll just sort of stay in the background.
I don't want to get in your way.
Well, suit yourself.
I'll see you later.
Right.
All right, darling, we're going to follow you on the boom from here inside the inn.
And when you get in the other set, do your song.
Let's see, I think you have the mood, your Hollywood success was empty, you've lost the one man you love.
You know, the usual hope.
Just make me cry and you can get to that wedding.
All ready for rehearsal!
Please! Let's shoot it.
Okay, it's a take!
All right, everybody, quiet on the stage, it's a take.
Close them up. Come on, over there, quiet down, let's get settled, everybody.
Come on, everybody, let's get settled now. This is the picture.
Hit the snow!
All right, roll 'em!
Sorry, Mr. Hanover, but when the red light's on you couldn't get in even if you owned the studio.
Oh, but, pop, this is important.
I know, so is the light.
Hit the playback. Music!
All right, action!
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
...dreaming of a white
Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
Jim!
Cut it! Cut it!
That's it!
All right, gentlemen!
How could he get that far in five minutes?
The lady must have been willing.
But the world can't do this to us.
Here she comes down the street
I'll admit my defeat
I've won my hot toddy
Over my scarred body
I knew that I'd win singing
But wait until she gets a load of your dancing
We'll stay at the inn singing
All by myself I'll have to stick to my dancing
Oh, no, my friend, I'm here to end
Your dancing trouble and strife
This will be fun, Miss Hit-and-Run
Has come back into my life
We'll stay at the inn...
We'll have to begin...
Singing!
Dancing!
We've each other to cling to
You'll be easy to sing to
And you're easy to dance with
So let the old year die with a fond good-bye
And our hopes as high as a kite
How can our love go wrong
If we start the new year right?
NARRATOR:
Just a few miles from Hollywood...
...is the largest studio in the world...
...the home of Warner Bros. pictures.
This is the entrance to a world
of glamour and enchantment.
Through these portals pass
the most beautiful trucks in the world...
...bringing to the studio many different
things necessary to produce a picture:
Equipment, costumes, everything,
in fact, from an airplane to a hairpin.
It's just an average day in the studio
for most of our people...
...but it seems to be a special event
for the director.
Mr. Trent's on the phone, Raoul.
Hello, Arthur.
You're my favorite producer...
...and l'd do anything in the world for you except that.
All right, let's finish this clambake.
-Yes, this is King Vidor. Put him on.
MAN: Have you made up your mind, King? l've made up my mind, Arthur.
Get yourself another boy. l'm a director, not a butcher.
-Oh, Mr. Curtiz.
-Yeah?
-Mr. Trent is on the phone again.
-Tell him stop calling me.
-My third no is final.
-Yes, sir.
WOMAN:
Yes, Mr. Trent. l'll take care of it.
And David Butler is here to see you.
-You're in, Mr. Butler.
-Thanks, honey.
Come in, David. l have great news for you.
BUTLER:
Arthur. l want you to know...
...that Curtiz, Walsh and Vidor have been calling me all morning...
...fighting to do this new picture l'm producing.
-But l'm saving it for you.
-Well, thanks.
You're gonna direct Mademoiselle Fifi starring Dennis Morgan.
-Great.
-And Jack Carson. lt's been nice knowing you.
[lNTERCOM BUZZlNG]
Yes, sir?
MAN: Have you talked any director
into doing the Morgan-Carson picture?
No, sir. lt seems there's only one man who'll direct a picture with Jack Carson in it.
We have to start shooting by Friday.
Whoever it is, get him.
-But just a minute--
-Get him.
Yes, sir.
Warner Bros. started talking pictures, now they're gonna finish them too. l won't let them do it to me.
Do you know what it'd be like with that guy in charge?
-Yup.
-l love Carson, he's a wonderful guy.
But he's such a big ham.
With him in front of the camera and behind the camera...
...where do l wind up?
Yup.
He'll give himself every love scene with the girl, every good line, every close-up.
The only thing the audience will see of me is the back of my head.
That's better than the front of Carson's.
At least l'd like my own mother to recognize me.
Yup.
What am l knocking myself out about a picture for anyway? l always wanted to go to Broadway.
The theater, the thrill of an opening night.
Doesn't it make the blood pound in your veins?
Yup.
Well, thanks, Coop.
-You've been a big help.
-l have?
Yup.
MAN: Say, the studio isn't really serious about letting Carson direct a picture?
-Serious? They're mad about it.
MAN: l can understand that.
CARSON:
Jealous.
Well, well, well. Jack Curtiz in person.
That's the trouble with actors, Ronnie.
No appreciation for what we do to make you look good.
Morgan would love to hear you say that.
Don't think it's gonna be easy directing Dennis. l love him, he's a wonderful guy, but he's such a big ham.
Well, what makes you think you'll have trouble with him?
CARSON: You know Morgan, always trying to get his face in the camera.
-l may have to turn him around.
-So you can get your face in the camera.
CARSON:
Yeah, yeah.
Well, now, let me get this straight.
-You love Dennis.
-That's right.
-He's a wonderful fellow.
-One of the best.
-But he's such a big ham.
-The biggest ham in Hollywood.
-Good luck.
-Thanks.
-Hi, genius.
CARSON: Hello.
Oh, hello, Dennis. l was just saying some nice things about you. l know, l saw the razor.
Wait a minute, you didn't finish my nails yet.
You got teeth, haven't you?
-Hello, Mr. Morgan.
-Hello, Agnes.
-A New York haircut, nice and short.
-Yes.
Hey, wait a minute, Dennis.
Not too short.
Don't forget, we're gonna do Mademoiselle Fifi.
About the gay '90s.
We need some of that fluff around our necks.
-Very short.
-Yes, sir.
Dennis, as your director, l insist you look the part...
...or else we'll get you a wig.
Fine, while you're at it, get somebody to stand under it.
Wait a minute, you can't quit the picture now.
-You can't do this to me.
-Why not? lf you're not in it, they'll cancel the whole thing.
Don't be silly, Jack.
You're gonna be the director, the star.
You're gonna see the picture. lt's a round robin, you can't miss.
-Just a minute, please.
-Yes, sir.
Look, l may as well be frank. l'm broke, l need the money. l'm building a house, l just bought a car. l gotta make this picture right now.
Money isn't everything.
Money brings unhappiness. l gotta get a hunk of that misery or else the sheriff will get me. l'd like to help you, but l've got a deal for a show.
The producer's in town today from New York. l'm running through some numbers for him. Great score too.
Why don't you drop over the recording stage later and eat your heart out?
Pretty soon, that's all l'll have left to eat. l'm not a bit moved.
Tomorrow l'll be on the train heading East.
Yeah? Look for me, l'll be on the track.
Stretched across it.
No, l can't do it. l need the money.
[SlNGlNG]
I'm no music critic
Still I know the songs I like
And this bebop has got to stop
It's time to call a strike
You're making a big mistake. His voice will never get over in New York.
So if there's anything
That you can do about it
Give me a song
With a beautiful melody
He gets so far off-key he needs a compass to get back.
Play it with strings
Till it sings in my memory
You need a trained voice for your show.
His isn't even housebroken.
Remain in your heart
If it takes you way back to the past
It's the kind of a song that will last
And if the words to the tune
Seem to say what you're thinking of
Just sing the words to the girl
And she'll fall in love
His really isn't such a bad voice. lt's just a little delinquent.
And when you're holding her tight
You'll find I'm as right as can be
She'll be glad that she fell
To a beautiful melody
That's right, you phony tenor, trample it to death.
And when you're holding her tight
You'll find I'm as right as can be
She'll be glad that she fell
Because she's under the spell
Of a beautiful melody
You can't take him to New York after that, can you?
-l should say not.
-l didn't think so. l can't even take my wife to Pasadena. l'm the janitor.
Congratulations, you were great.
And we'll sign the contract tomorrow.
MORGAN:
Thank you very much.
When you hit New York with that song, it'll sweep the country.
Well, thank you, sir. Thank you.
Grace.
Here, take this to Jack Carson's dressing room.
Oh, no, l'm too young to die.
-Please, let me take Mr. Carson's lunch.
-Are you serious? l've been in Hollywood three months and l haven't had a chance yet to audition. l got news for you:
You're not getting one now.
Thanks. lf you're not back in half an hour, l'll send out a searching party.
What's the rush, young lady?
Sorry, Mr. Greenstreet. l was running to Jack Carson's dressing room.
That's a switch. They're usually running when they come out.
CARSON: Who's there?
-Lunch.
CARSON:
Come in, lunch.
But you can't stop building now, there's only one wall in the bathroom.
Look, l'll get the money. l'll--
Do you wanna buy half a house?
Combination sun deck and bathroom.
Look, any time you're ready. Unless you want me to eat out of your hand.
Oh, l'm sorry.
-This is a delicious lunch.
-l wish it wasn't.
-l better not get used to eating.
-Pot cheese and sauerkraut.
-lt's good for what ails you.
-lf it isn't, it'll give it to you.
You're new here, aren't you? l've been at Warner Bros. a little while...
...but in Hollywood three months, four days and 22 hours.
A native, huh? lt's so different from the little town l come from.
Oh, you probably never even heard of it.
Gurky's Corners, Wisconsin. l never heard--? l come from Milwaukee, that's only 1 4 miles from there. l'll never forget one Saturday in Gurky's Corners. l had the most wonderful....
What am l doing? l'm supposed to be depressed.
Well, l can't understand why.
You're a director and a famous actor.
Oh, l know if l ever get the chance to sing and act...
...l'll be the happiest girl in the whole world.
Nobody's happy in Hollywood.
You get knifed in the back by your best friend.
Well, l know if l ever get the chance to sing and act...
...l'll be the happiest girl in the world.
Uh-oh. l feel an audition coming on.
Look, bright eyes, would you mind leaving? l'm not in the mood right now.
How long have you been in Hollywood?
-Three months.
-You must have studied nights. l've been in every casting office in this town.
And they won't even look at me.
This is first chance l've had to be alone with a director...
...and show him what l can do, and you're gonna listen.
Oh, listen.
All right, Peter, maybe l am nothing to you.
A tramp you picked up at Leicester
Square to throw away like an old shoe.
But remember this, l am a woman.
[KEY CLATTERS]
Yeah, that's great, kid, honest, but you're barking up the wrong director. l won't have a job myself unless l keep Dennis Morgan off that train.
-And get him to sign for the picture.
-No, no. Don't leave us. l'm not thinking of myself. l know l'm dirt under your feet.
-But what about the baby?
-What?
-Your baby.
-My baby. l don't even know her.
Even the lowest creature crawling on this Earth...
...couldn't desert an innocent child.
Hey, wait a minute.
Come here, kid.
The lowest creature crawling on this
Earth. That's him-- l mean, that's it.
Hey, you got something.
-What's your name?
-Judy Adams.
-l could change it.
-How'd you like to play a scene for me?
You made me the happiest girl in the whole world.
Wait a minute.
Get me the Wardrobe, quick.
You do me this favor, l'll give you a part in my new picture.
-Now.
-Oh, Mr. Carson.
[HUMMlNG]
[KNOCKlNG ON DOOR]
Yes?
-My husband must never know.
-l'll be the last one to tell him.
Really, if he knew l came here, there's no telling what he would do.
Oh, that clears up everything.
-lt's been nice seeing you.
-But you don't understand.
-l am Mrs. Jack Carson.
-Mrs. Jack Carson?
Wait over there.
Go ahead, this is very interesting.
Jack and l were childhood sweethearts.
And last year, when he came back to Wisconsin, he swept me off my feet.
We were married in my hometown,
Gurky's Corners.
Jack said we had to keep it a secret. lt would hurt his career.
Yeah, with other girls. The snake.
But we can't keep it a secret any longer.
You see, l'm going to have a....
-No.
-Yes.
A baby. He doesn't deserve it.
Now, you shouldn't be standing.
Sit down and rest.
-Here, take this.
-Thank you.
When l phoned Jack last month and told him he was gonna be a mother-- l mean, a father, his whole attitude changed.
He became tender and kind, considerate. lt's hard to believe he's really human.
And then he sent for me to come to Hollywood.
Started building a house with a little pink and blue nursery.
Ran himself into debt.
And now that the picture's been canceled...
...there's nothing left for me to do but go back to Gurky's Corners.
Aw, you poor kid.
You know, when he told me he needed money and everything...
...l thought he was just kidding.
Well, it may be my death warrant...
...but l'll sign the contract for the picture. lt's a good thing it's still here. l'll see that you get that house and that pink and blue nursery.
Even though Jack will grab the room and make the kid sleep in the basement.
Here.
Oh, thanks.
Go ahead. Go on, go on.
This is Dennis. l have something for the front office.
Will you send a studio messenger over?
Sorry l'm late.
Thank you. lt's getting late. l better get these dishes to the commissary.
Yes, l guess you better.
Hey, nice going, kid. You were great.
Look, here's 5 bucks.
Load up on pot cheese and sauerkraut.
You'll have to load on plasma when l get through with you.
CARSON: Dennis--
-Wait a minute, l don't want this.
You promised l'd be in your picture.
Mrs. Jack Carson.
How stupid can a guy get?
-The wife-and-baby gag.
CARSON: Yeah, but, Dennis....
You ought to thank her.
She gave you a chance to be directed by Carson.
Direct? You couldn't teach Lassie how to act like a dog.
Oh, l don't know about that.
Where l come from, a promise is a promise, Mr. Carson.
Pink and blue nursery, that's where l ought to be.
-With a rattle in each hand.
-l was so anxious to be in your picture. l was even willing to double-cross Mr. Morgan. l'll see to it that you're as good as Jane Wyman was in Johnny Belinda.
-She didn't even talk in that one.
-Well, you can't have everything.
Now, you listen to me. l worked hard for this chance.
And you think you can brush me off with $5. l'm sorry l fooled you, Mr. Morgan.
But l don't think very much of you, refusing to help your best friend. l'm taking the next train back to Gurky's Corners.
What's with her?
What's she so upset about?
-What'd you promise her?
-You know, a part in the picture.
The usual malarkey.
Did you ever think she believed you?
Oh, how could she?
Everybody knows l'm a liar.
Maybe word hasn't reached
Gurky's Corners yet.
-Made me look like a heel too.
-Yeah.
That kid sounded like her heart was broken. l can't worry about every girl whose heart l break.
-l'd be staying up nights.
-Yeah, she'll get over it.
Yeah, sure.
[PHONE RlNGS]
Hey, maybe that's her. Or she....
Not that l care.
MORGAN:
Can't be her.
She was gonna take the next train to Gurky's Corners.
Hello? Oh, hello, Arthur.
Hello, Jack, Jane Wyman is here. l just told her she was going to play the title role in Mademoiselle Fifi...
...and that you were gonna direct her personally. lt came as a bit of a surprise to her.
No, no. That would be impossible.
Here, Mommy, take this.
Oh, thank you, Maureen.
TRENT:
Not without a complete rest.
Suddenly called out of town, huh?
-Well, l'll get another leading lady.
-l just talked to the boss. lf you don't get one by Friday, you'll be out of a job.
Okay, by Friday.
Why don't you put on a girdle and play the part yourself? l'm going up to the front office.
Maybe you could play my part too.
But, Dennis. Dennis, you gotta help me find a leading lady.
Look, we're pals, buddies.
When you came to Hollywood, broke, didn't have what to eat...
-...who gave you your first square meal?
-Salvation Army.
-Who phoned them?
-Who gave you the nickel?
That was a slug.
Look, Dennis, you know Alexis Smith, don't you?
-Yeah.
-Well, couldn't you just talk to her?
-No.
-Dennis.
Dennis. Wait a minute.
What about Eleanor Parker?
We might as well face it.
You're a wonderful guy and l love you.
-But you're such a big ham.
-You're such a big ham, l know.
No leading lady is gonna trust her career to you.
-What?
-Find yourself some unknown kid.
Somebody who doesn't know any better.
Of course. Sit down.
-Let Daddy take over.
-What are you talking about?
-Mrs. Jack Carson.
-You mean little Miss Pot Cheese?
Sure, it's the oldest story in the world.
Big star steps out of the part, little country girl takes over.
Little country girl becomes big star. lt's the great Hollywood fable.
-Hey, l think you got something there.
-Yeah. l'll discover her, l'll put her to picture, l'll direct her.
That beautiful doll will be grateful to me, very grateful.
Oh, no, l'll discover her. l'll play the love scenes with her.
We'll rehearse at my house at night.
And she'll be very grateful to me.
Wait a minute, she can't be grateful enough for both of us.
Anyway, it won't work. l mean, those things just....
They just don't happen in real life.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, l guess you're right. l was carried away.
Besides, l think she was playing you for a big sucker.
Yeah, country girl, huh?
Probably works behind the third bubble at the downtown burlesque.
Trying to con the two of us into a part in the picture.
-A couple of smart guys like us, huh?
-Ridiculous, isn't it?
-A couple of smart guys like us.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, l guess l'll get myself a glass of orange juice.
Well, l think l'll go get a glass of milk.
-See you later.
-Yeah.
Goodbye. Now....

-Gurky's Corners.
Miss, l've been on this job since 1 932...

My mother will be very surprised to hear that. l was born there.
Oh, born, huh?
Well, just a moment.
Excuse me, l haven't had this open in 1 5 years.
Gurky's Corners. Gurky's Corners.

And you have exactly 28 and one-half minutes to make it.
What track?
Why don't you go to San Francisco?

MAN [O VER SPEAKERS] :
Train 67 on Track 3.
-Play a song for you, señorita?
-Only 1 0 cents, we play beautiful song.
-For 1 5 cents, we go away.
-No, thank you.
Good, we are tired of playing anyhow.
-The way we play--
-Might cheer you up, though.
Very funny.
JUD Y: Thanks, l don't feel like hearing a song.
Judy, l've been looking all over for you. l wanted to explain what happened in my dressing room.
-You don't have to explain anything.
-Wait a minute, let him explain.
-Sounds interesting.
-What happened in your dressing room?
-Would you gentlemen mind moving on?
-Only 1 0 cents, we play beautiful song.
-For a quarter, we go away.
-lt was 1 5 cents before.
-Fifteen cents, two for a quarter.
-Here.
We got a good racket, lady.
Don't louse it up. l don't blame you for being angry with me.
When you hear what l have to say, l'm sure you'll be very grateful.
Chicago, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia.
Train leaving on Track....
But why did Mr. Carson make all those promises?
You've got to understand Jack.
There's nothing malicious about him.
He's really trying to be warm-hearted, generous and kind.
-You two really stick up for each other.
-You bet we do. lt's not his fault that his personality's just a little obnoxious.
You've really got something, kid.
-Believe me, l've seen them.
-l'd like to believe you, Mr. Morgan.
But how do l know l'm not being fooled this time too?
How do l know that you and the producer are like this: lf l'm not telling you the truth, may l never see the light of day again.
Game called on account of darkness.
Don't believe anything this walking Blarney Stone is saying.
He and the producer aren't like this:
Not like that:
They're not even like that:
Lookit, Judy, l'm gonna be honest with you.
We can't guarantee you're gonna be a star.
But we're gonna do everything to see that you get a break.
But l've been fooling myself. l can't act.
-Hasn't stopped him.
-Hasn't stopped him. l said it first.
No, l'm going home and marry Jeffrey Bushdinkle.
-lf he'll still have me.
-But this is your chance.
You've read about this:
Star steps out of picture.
-Country girl takes her place.
-Country girl becomes a star. l mustn't listen to you. l mustn't believe you.
You fooled me once, l mustn't let it happen again.
-But we're on the level, Judy.
-How can we prove it to you?
Danny.
Danny.
[MUMBLlNG]
He'll tell you.
Can't we make her a star?
MORGAN: Aren't we always on the level?
-Tell her about us, Danny.
Yeah, you hear that?
But l'm just a little waitress.
No Hollywood producer even looked at me.
Because you don't dress the part.
All you need is clothes. lsn't that right?
We'll get her an ensemble from top to bottom. lnside out too.
-That ought to do it, eh, Danny boy?
-Yes.
Oh, that sounds wonderful. l'll stay.
Oh, thanks, Danny.
You convinced her.
[SQUEALS]
-Did we make you miss your train?
-How could you? l am the train.
[HOOTS]
[lMlTATES TRAlN CHUGGlNG]
Oh, l've seen so many beautiful things. l don't know which to pick. l'm having the same trouble myself.
This dress would look wonderful on you.
-We'll take that. Have the lady try it on.
-Yes, sir. Come with me, dear.
Hey, what's the idea?
-l don't like that dress on Judy.
-Look, we have an agreement.
Today, she's mine. What l say goes.
All right, but tomorrow, she's mine.
And off comes that dress.
-l'll put it back on her Thursday.
-Friday, l'll take it right off again.
-Well, really?
-You--
You two boys ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
Think of what you're doing to that poor, innocent girl.
-But, Joan, you don't understand.
-Two grown men acting like grown men.
Why, Joan, you don't think Jack and l'd take advantage of a situation like this.
Are you kidding?
Joan, l told you, you don't understand. l've never denied you anything. Anything money could buy l've given you.
But that wasn't enough, was it?
Things are going to be different.
-They aren't doing anything wrong.
-Just a minute. Get out.
Get your things out before l throw them and you with them.
Get out before l kill you.
What's that for? l do that in all my pictures.
-Sweet girl.
-Yeah.
Oh, l just love Miss Crawford on the screen.
You know, l still don't like this dress on Judy.
Well, you know, maybe we're wrong about the way we're handling her.
-What do you mean?
-We shouldn't take her to Trent's office.
He always likes to discover his own talent.
Running an elevator, behind a soda fountain, dancing in a chorus.
Yeah, the old Hollywood fable.
Hey, l just got an idea. l knew you'd make it.
[TlRES SCREECHlNG &
HORNS HONKlNG] l can't understand it. l can't either.
But there it is.
Every girl l see looks the same to me.
About 5-foot-4, blond, and they all smile at me with that same sickening smile.
DOCTOR: l think these lenses will solve your problem.
TRENT: l certainly hope so, doctor. l don't need an oculist. l need an analyst.
[WHlSTLlNG]
-This ought to do the trick.
-What?
Even if she doesn't get the part, she can always pick up a few extra dimes.
Her name is McLaughlan.
She lives in the apartment below us.
And her boyfriend's a policeman.
Looking for Judy?
-l could change my mind.
-Don't bother with me. l've already had my career.
Judy's not in.
-You got any idea where l could find her?
-l'll break it to you gently.
Dennis Morgan, Hollywood Bowl, stars shining, full moon.
You poor boy. lt's wonderful of you to get tickets for the Bowl.
This is as good a time as any to tell you, Judy...
...l've got another ticket for you.
This is a railroad ticket to Gurky's Corners. lt would never have worked. lt started out as a gag and got away from us.
The two big brains, the star makers.
Believe me, go on back home before you get hurt.
Do you think it would be the first time l ever got hurt? l know it's gonna be tough and maybe l'll never succeed...
...but l've made up my mind and l'm a stubborn person.
Thousands of girls in Hollywood as stubborn as you. l worked in the five-and-ten, eight and a half hours a day...
...to earn money so l could take dramatic lessons from Mrs. Hoskins.
-And l took singing lessons too.
-From Mr. Hoskins?
Go ahead and laugh, but he's pretty good.
-He could even help you too.
-Probably, but that's beside the point.
Odds are against you. Why don't you go home where they're aren't?
Maybe l can't act and maybe l can't sing...
...but l wanna find out for myself,
Mr. Dennis Morgan.
And if you don't mind, l'll buy my own ticket to the Hollywood Bowl.
You win, kid.
Even if you don't get to be a star...
...Hollywood's gonna know it's been in a fight.
And l'm gonna do my best to see you get a break.
Oh, Mr. Morgan, you made me the happiest girl in the whole world.
Anybody around here seen Dennis Morgan?
-Do you feel a draft?
-No, why?
A big wind just blew in.
-Oh, Mr. Morgan.
-Sticks and stones may break my bones--
Come on. We better hurry.
-lsn't Mr. Carson going with us?
-Sorry, only two.
Hey.
Seventeenth row.
Lucky l got here in time.
-l'm Jack Carson.
-Yes? l'd like my usual tickets.
Seventeenth row.
Anybody wanna use the field glasses?
Oh, no. l'd rather guess at the whole thing.
Well, l'm glad they were sold out. lt's so much more beautiful from up here.
Except when the clouds get in your way.
You know, l kind of like this longhair stuff.
When l sit here listening to that Beethoven--
Wagner.
That stuff, it does something to me.
Makes a fellow feel like he needs a girl.
Does it make a girl feel like she needs a fellow?
All l can think of is how cold l am.
Wish there was some way to keep warm.
Maybe you'd like one of us to get your coat.
Oh, that'd be wonderful, Mr. Carson.
Allow me.
Why, Mr. Morgan. lt'll be a pleasure.
Well, as long as you're up, you're closer to the parking lot.
You're closer now.
All right, l'll get her coat for her, and she'll be grateful to me.
Very grateful. lf l get back soon enough.
Well, Judy, alone at long last.
Mr. Morgan, you shouldn't hold my hand.
-What would Mr. Carson think?
-What would Mr. Carson think with?
-And besides, Jeffrey wouldn't like it.
-Jeffrey?
Jeffrey Bushdinkle, my boyfriend.
-Nobody's named Jeffrey Bushdinkle.
-Except Jeffrey Bushdinkle.
You may not believe this, but he's really awfully nice. lf this were Gurky's Corners, you know what we'd be doing?
What?
We'd be down at Hanson's drugstore listening to the juke box.
And maybe even to one of your records too.
That sounds like a song cue, if l ever heard one.
[SlNGlNG]
If all my dreams are not about you
Blame my absent-minded heart
It's really quite regretful
That my heart is so forgetful
When you're away
It always seems to fall apart
If I don't show I'm lost without you
Blame my absent-minded heart
Did we meet in December?
There's so much it must remember
And if I haven't said
I've loved you from the start
Blame my absent-minded heart
[SlNGlNG]
If I don't show I'm lost without you
Blame my absent-minded heart
Did we meet in December?
There's so much it must remember
And if I haven't said
I've loved you from the start
Blame my
-Absent-minded heart
-Absent-minded heart
To coin a phrase, l hope l'm not intruding.
Oh, Mr. Carson, thanks for bringing my coat.
Yeah, you won't need it now.
You're warm enough.
Have you any future plans for the evening, Mr. Casanova?
-We were going to Schwab's for a soda.
-Oh, now, isn't that peachy? l'll be glad to drive you.
-Oh, thanks.
-Just a minute.
What'll it be, folks? l want a banana split with chocolate, strawberry, vanilla ice cream...
...maraschino cherries, and don't spare the whipped cream.
-What?
-She must be on a diet.
-Yeah.
-l always had that at Hanson's. l'll have a pineapple soda myself.
-What about you?
-l'm not drinking tonight.
Do you think you could spare me for a minute?
-l forgot about a phone call.
-Don't be too soon. l have a hunch he's up to something.
Aren't you?
Believe me, Judy.
All l wanna do is arrange a screen test for you.
-Really?
-Really.
And if Jack had any sense....
Let's see who the brain is calling.
What? Oh, gee, Mr. Trent, you shouldn't talk that way. l got my mother's picture in my pocket.
Oh, yes. Yes, Arthur.
Yes, if you insist, we'll test the new girl in Technicolor.
Spare no expense, huh?
We're like that:
What are you trying to do?
Drive me into an early ulcer?
We're not making tests of unknowns in Technicolor...
...black and white or pencil drawings.
Oh, no, no, three cameras will be more than plenty.
First thing in the morning, huh?
All right.
We'll go right to the recording stage.
Recording stage?
You won't even get on the lot.
-And that's the way it is.
-But l can't understand why.
-Having trouble?
-Oh, no, no.
Not at all.
Mr. Trent left word not to let Mr. Carson on the lot.
You and Trent are like this, eh?
This must be you.
Sorry, Mr. Carson, those are my orders.
Charlie, help me.
Forget about what Mr. Trent said.
We're trying to give this kid a break.
Gonna record her.
-Trent will thank you when he sees it.
-l got my orders.
Never mind. l'll take over.
Now listen, flatfoot, you heard my pal.
He wants to give the kid a break.
Now knock off and let him in.
-l got my orders.
-Come on now, scram, out of the way.
Listen, you don't scare me.
Come here, wise guy.
Just a minute.
Now, look, Charlie, l've got a reputation for being tough.
Do what l say.
Otherwise, people will start talking, stop going to my pictures.
Studio will lose money, they'll close up shop, shut down.
You'll be out of a job.
-l never thought of it that way.
-Well, think of it that way, will you?
Go ahead. Go on.
Go ahead. Get in there.
Now, look here.
You're not gonna open that big fat trap of yours, are you?
No, Mr. Robinson.
-My friends can go through?
-Yes, Mr. Robinson.
And smile.
-Thanks, Eddie.
-Ain't nothing.
What l won't do to keep my job.
Me too.
MAN:
That's fine, boys.
Now, the next number, we'll use the quartet.
Right over here, boys.
CARSON:
Hold it a minute, will you, Ray?
-Well, what is it now?
-Don't get excited already.
Well, what is it? l got some extra work for you, that's all.
Sorry, but l'm tied up with the Ernie Felice Quartet.
We wanna record a chorus of ''Big Fat Lie'' ...
...with Miss Adams for the test.
Sorry, Dennis, l haven't got the time.
Listen, Heindorf, as the director of Mademoiselle Fifi...
...l order you to do it. l won't do it. And if you don't like it, you can take it up with Petrillo.
Pardon me.
Are you the Ray Heindorf...
...the musical genius of the motion-picture industry?
-You boys know ''Big Fat Lie''?
-Yeah, we know it, Ray.
-Put her on the mike.
-Right.
Right this way, Judy. Here.
Here's a copy of the music.
A sheer coincidence.
What l'd like to know is this:
How can she possibly sing a song she never even heard before?
Do l ask that about your pictures?
[SlNGlNG] I kind of believed you
When you said your nights were lonely
Till the day that I came by
But when you whispered
That I was your one and only
That was a big fat lie
I should've been wiser than I was
And seen right through you
But the moon got in my eye
That stuff about
"I never lived until I knew you"
That was a big fat lie
You must've started to fib
When you were wearing a bib
And such a habit's hard to break
A little lie is okay
But when you lie night and day
That's more than even I can take
You told me we ought to marry
And I let you sway me
Kissed my happy days goodbye
And when you told that man
You'd honor and obey me
That, baby, was a big fat lie
Let's face it.
You're no George Washington.
An overexaggeration
Of a super prevarication
Just a big fat lie
-Great. You were great, kid.
-Thanks.
Just a second, actor. l'm the director in this picture.
Didn't you like it?
The pear-shaped tones came out pear-shaped...
...but the interpretation was all wrong.
How would you know?
Because she's supposed to be Mademoiselle Fifi.
You know, French, Paris,
Folies Bergère, l'amour.
When you sing, l wanna hear those postcards in your voice.
-l'll run through it once for her, Ray.
-Boys, let's take it again. l want the full orchestra.
No offense, fellas. lt's just that my voice is so rich that l need the full treatment.
-Make those violins moan.
-They won't be the only ones.
Sit down.
[SlNGlNG] I kind of believed you
When you said your nights were lonely
Till the day that I came by
But when you whispered
That I was your one and only
Chérie, that was a big fat lie
And you know that
You must've started to fib
When you were wearing
What you call a bib
And such a habit that's hard to break
A little lie that's okay
But when you lie night and day
That's more than even I, me
I can't take that
You told me we ought to marry
And I let you sway me
Kissed my happy days goodbye
And when you told that man
You'd honor and obey me
That, my petite, was a big fat--
[HORNS BLOW]
That, baby, was a big fat lie
CARSON:
Dennis, now watching, thinking. l'll give you a snap when to start.
Let me hear that playback.
Clear the center, everybody.
Got a lot of work here.
[MORGAN SlNGlNG
ON RECORDlNG]
-No, no, no, l wanna hear Judy's voice.
-Very pretty.
Judy, when you hear that song, act like you're singing it.
-Okay.
-And you, Dennis, just act.
-Or am l asking the impossible?
-Thank you very much.
All right. Let's go.
Judy, listen to everything Jack says, do exactly the opposite.
You'll be a big success.
-l'll take over.
-lt's all yours.
MORGAN: You can't run that camera.
Wait for the crew.
We can't. No time to wait.
Trent's liable to find out about this any minute.
After all, what is this?
Just a big Brownie. l haven't been making pictures for 1 0 years without learning something.
Listen, you've been living for 30 without much improvement.
Listen, wise guy, l'll handle my own camera and my own cue lights...
...my own playback, my own equipment.
May l make my own entrance?
Yeah, if that's possible.
-You're too kind.
CARSON: Okay, boys, l'm rolling.
Speed.
Action. l'll make this a screen test
Hollywood will never forget.
-Oh, have you got my pills?
-This is the third one today, Mr. Trent. l'm pushing myself too hard.
Three pictures going at once.
Two more in preparation.
You ought to get away on a vacation and forget about the studio for a while.
What's the matter?
For just a moment, you looked 5-foot-4, blond...
...and you were wearing that same sickening smile.
Are you sure you feel up to seeing the tests this morning?
We'll make a stab at it anyway.
[BUZZES]
CARSON [SlNGlNG ON RECORDlNG] :

Mademoiselle.
Mademoiselle, Mademoiselle Fifi.
JUD Y [SlNGlNG ON RECORDlNG] :
You must have started to fib
When you were wearing a bib
And such a habit's hard to break
What happened to his voice?
A little lie is okay
But when you lie night and day

BUGS BUNNY:
What's up, doc?
[GUNFlRE ON RECORDlNG]
[HOOTlNG & CHATTERlNG
ON RECORDlNG]
[SCREAMlNG ON RECORDlNG] l think l can hear them applauding.
Oh, you're in, baby.
You know something?
Maybe we ought to change this contract to 600 a week.
But l'm not worth that much.
Oh, Mr. Trent. Mr. Trent.
Why, Trent will come out of there raving about you.
-We'll make it 700 a week.
-Pardon me, please.
-Well, maybe 600's enough.
-l'm sorry, sir. l'm sorry.
How about 500?
Do you think l can get my job back at the commissary?
MAN [ON TV] :
--throwing the book at him...
...and how that French Killer
can take it.
There he goes.
He's down again, but not for long.
He's right back up again.
What men. How do they stand it?
The crowd is going mad.
They wanted action,
and they're sure getting it tonight.
Excuse me. l get excited at these things.
-l understand, l'm the same way myself.
-Yeah.
You can't tell me
these matches are not on the level.
The Swede is suffering.
Even though Mr. Trent had a nervous breakdown and has to go...
...the picture is canceled, and they foreclosed on your house...
...l want you to know l'm not discouraged.
He's hitting the Swedish Maniac
with everything but the referee.
All right, so I'm a liar.
What if you can't be in that Broadway show...
...because they found somebody else?
You might've been terrible in it anyway. l believe in looking at the brighter side.
Anything goes in there tonight.
Down on the mat again.
And they both got a hold.
Now what's gonna happen?
Oh-oh. What a switch.
Mr. Trent hasn't left town yet, you know.
Oh, if l could just get the chance to sing for him.
Whoa, nelly, he's really squeezing
and putting it on.
But the referee wants to see
and nobody's gonna stop him.
He's right in there for a close look,
but maybe he looked a little too close.
He's getting squeezed himself.
He can take it too.
He got himself in that fix.
It looks like he'll have to get out
of it same way he got in.
But you can't give up.
You've gotta be like them.
The Swedish Maniac and French Killer, fighting for their countries.
-Swedish Maniac and the French Killer.
-Two guys from Milwaukee.
Yeah, named Sam.
Gotta have that foreign bill up to draw in suckers.
-Otherwise, they wouldn't draw flies.
-Flies, they might. l don't believe it. lf that was a fake,
Hollywood wouldn't fall for it.
The French Killer's weakening,
the Swede's got him.
Hey, hold everything.
Say something in French.
-Mademoiselle from Armentieres.
-That's great.
What's Arthur Trent looking for?
An established star for Mademoiselle Fifi.
Okay, we'll give him one.
-Direct from Paris.
-We'll change the color of her hair.
Her makeup, her wardrobe.
--kicking, punching, biting.
They'll put the picture back on schedule, l'll get my house back, my new car.
[SPEAKS lN FRENCH]
His arms around the Killer's neck.
He's getting weaker
and weaker and weaker....
Here are your train tickets, Mr. Trent.
You have Compartment B, Car 1 6.
You know this will be my first vacation in 20 years? lt'll do you good.
Pretty decent of the studio to pay my expenses...
...make my reservations for me, tell me to stay as long as l like.
Who's trying to get rid of me?
Who wants to put the knife in me?
Why is everybody being so nice?
Mr. Trent, your nerves are getting the best of you.
Yes, l guess you're right. lt was awfully nice of the studio to arrange this trip.
But why so soon?
What are they trying to do to me?
[PHONE RlNGS]
Mr. Trent's office. lt's The Hollywood Reporter.
Oh, probably calling to say goodbye.
-Hello.
-Hello, Arthur.
Calling about a cable just received from Paris.
Yvonne Amour, star of Comédie-Française...
...rumored secretly signed by Warner Bros...
...arrives Pasadena today for lead in Mademoiselle Fifi.
Say, l thought that picture was postponed.
The wolves are moving in.
My chair isn't even cold yet.
Somebody else is taking over my job of producing Mademoiselle Fifi. l'll call you back and give you the whole story.
As soon as I find out myself.
Let me have a half-hour. l promise l'll give you an exclusive. l'll get the front office.
No. How do l know who's my friend?
How do l know who's my enemy?
Everybody's sweet to me.
-Please, better take another one of this.
-Sometimes, l even wonder about you.
Get me Publicity.
No, no, no, Publicity. l don't know the number.
The telephone girls too.
[PHONE RlNGS]
Yes? Oh, hello, Arthur.
The stills on who?
Anybody ever hear of a French pastry named Yvonne Amour?
MAN 1 : No.
MAN 2: Never heard of her.
You sure you got the name right,
Arthur?
No, l'm not double-crossing anybody.
You're my favorite producer.
[PHONE RlNGS]
Publicity.
The wire service wants some background on Yvonne Amour.
Yvonne Amour again?
A minute. Papers wanna know what time her train gets to Pasadena. lt's the New York office.
They never send us their releases, figure we can read it in the paper.
Arthur, we'll have the pictures over this afternoon.
Now, listen, boys. Send a couple of cameramen over to Pasadena.
We want some cheesecake on Amour,
''l love America'' with her legs crossed.
They want a biography.
Yvonne Amour, born in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower.
-How do you know?
-lt's a big tower.
Her father, a colonel in the French Foreign Legion.
Killed 1 6 years ago in northern Afghanistan.
Mother?
A Russian ballerina.
White Russian, of course.
So beautiful,
1 8 duels were fought over her.
-Living?
-Poor kid got caught in the crossfire.
-The rest you can make up.
-Skolsky's on the line.
We throwing a luncheon for Amour?
What luncheon?
A dinner, a party, the works.
We'll take over a whole sound stage.
Hors d'oeuvres, champagne.
Call the French consul, we're having frog's legs.
She was born in Paris under the Eiffel Tower.
Her mother's White Russian.
CHORUS [SlNGlNG] :
Fiddle-dee-dee, fiddle-dee-di

Oh, fiddle-dee-di
Fiddle-dee-dee, fiddle-dee-di
Life is an all-the-year-round

Oh, fiddle-dee-dee
I should worry, I should care
I should envy a millionaire

Don't ask yourself why
Be happy
Singing fiddle-dee-dee
Swinging fiddle-dee-dee
Singing fiddle-dee-dee

Ray, here they are now.
This thing's getting away from us.
These cablegrams were just to get an audition with Trent...
-...not to bring out the Foreign Legion.
-Ooh-la-la.
-How do we get out of here?
-lt's too late now.
We may all wind up in the bastille. l can't keep my eyes open.
My eyelashes are getting so heavy.
-Hold your head back.
-lf l do, my wig starts slipping.
-We're in trouble.
-Mademoiselle, welcome to Warner Bros.
[lN FRENCH ACCENT]
Oh, l love America.
PHOTOGRAPHER:

Will you come with me, please?
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Get in a little closer, fellas.
MAN:

Excuse me, l'll be right back.
You're gonna be happy in America, working in pictures.
Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKS lN FRENCH]
Get a load of that accent.
-We're in trouble.
-You said that.
Yeah, but now we're in mucho trouble.
You'll love making pictures,
Miss Amour.
[JUD Y SPEAKS lN FRENCH]
Of course, you do have to get up a little early, around 5:30.
On the set by 8.
Makeup, Wardrobe, those lights and those directors.
All work, work, work.
Nothing to eat, you have to diet.
Keep those hips down.
No fun, early to bed, early to rise.
Keeps your agent healthy, wealthy and wise.
-You'll love it.
-Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKlNG lN FRENCH]
Yeah, merci beaucoup.
We'll see you later, kids.
Poor kid.
And they'll probably make her a blond.
CARSON:
Pardon us. Pardon us, please.
Mademoiselle, may l present Mr. Arthur Trent...
...one of my favorite producers.
[SPEAKS lN FRENCH]
Oh, likewise.
Oh, likewise.
Shall we all eat before we lose our bon appétit?
Yes, yes, yes.
Mademoiselle Amour, may l present Monsieur Andre Bernet...
...and a delegation of your countrymen.
[SPEAKlNG lN FRENCH]
[SPEAKS lN FRENCH]
Mademoiselle has a fine sense of humor.
Yes. ln fact, she'd like to sing a song before we eat. Shall we?
[SPEAKS lN FRENCH]
Ray, may l present Yvonne Amour.
-Mr. Heindorf.
-Well, how do you do?
Her favorite song is ''Café Rendezvous.''
That song hasn't been published yet.
Does she know it? l study him. l know him.
-What?
-She knows him.
-Mademoiselle.
-''Café Rendezvous,'' boys.
[SlNGlNG]
At the Café Rendezvous
I was lonely, so were you
Your eyes said dance
I wanted to
When we danced
I heard you mispronounce
''Je vous adore''
And after our first kiss
You mispronounced
''Encore''
It was morning in Paris
[SlGHS] l knew you'd be enthusiastic about her.
To me
I was not sad
Because I knew
We would surely meet again
I know where and when
Tonight, I'll be waiting there for you
At the Café Rendezvous
Where did you say this young lady is from?
Paris.
-France?
-Yeah.
[SPEAKlNG lN FRENCH]
Oh, mademoiselle.
Blond? Blond.
[CHATTERlNG]
-l told you they'd make her a blond.
-You were right.
Well, it all happens at once.
The picture's canceled,
Trent's leaving for New York.
-Everything's finished.
-Yeah.
Well, it's up to you to tell Judy the bad news.
-Why me?
-You got us into this, didn't you?
-Hello, Mr. Carson.
-Oh, hello.
-Who's that?
-Oh, her name's McLaughlan.
She lives here too.
Gee, l don't know what to say to Judy.
[DOORBELL BUZZES]
-Hi, Judy.
-Well, when do we eat?
We'll have dinner in about five minutes.
-Come on in.
-Yeah?
-Go ahead, Dennis.
-No, you go ahead.
Yeah.
Grace is out getting the dessert.
Well, have you talked to the studio?
Dinner. That reminds me of a joke.
One cannibal said to the other cannibal,
''What's cooking in the big pot?''
The other cannibal says, ''Dinner.''
So the first cannibal says,
''Anybody we know?''
So the first cannibal says,
''Anybody we know?''
Yeah.
But have you talked to the studio?
Oh, yeah, the studio, huh?
-They loved you.
-What about Mr. Trent?
Oh, you really sent him.
Look, l know l messed it up.
But as long as you have faith in me, l won't stop trying. l want you both to know l'm not discouraged. Not a bit.
Why didn't you tell her the truth?
She thinks she's still got a chance.
Didn't have the heart.
Why didn't you tell her?
Well, l got a heart too.
But right now, it feels like a lump of pot cheese and sauerkraut.
''Mr. Jeffrey Bushdinkle.
Gurky's Corners, Wisconsin.''
Don't read Judy's mail. l'm not, but at least l can see where it's going, can't l?
Blow on it. You might steam it open.
Hello, Grace. l was just weighing it to see if there was enough postage on it. lf you wanna know, it starts off with ''Dear Jeffrey.''
Yeah, we figured that out ourselves.
What you didn't figure out is the rest of it. l don't have to open that letter.
Fourscore and seven years ago, l wrote the same one. l could've gone back to my home town...
...and married a guy who was crazy about me.
But no. l wrote him and said l chose a career instead.
Hm. Some career.
Lettuce and tomato on rye.
Hold the mayonnaise.
But this is different, Judy's got talent.
We'll figure out something.
Why don't you two stop giving her that hokey routine?
She likes this Jeffrey Bushdinkle and he likes her.
-l like Judy too.
-Oh, l like her very much.
From what l have gathered,
Jeffrey wants to marry her.
Yeah, but we can see that she gets fame and fortune.
-You gotta make her go back home.
-Oh, we can't do that. l tried once.
She won't leave as long as she thinks Hollywood is wonderful...
...and you two are knights in shining armor doing everything to help her. lf we could make her think we're really a couple of heels.
Oh, now, Dennis.
How could we possibly do that?
Yeah.
Hey, that redhead.
-Who?
-The one who lives downstairs.
-lrene McLaughlan?
-Yeah.
-You can help us.
-Sure, anything you say.
-Here's what we'll do.
-Yeah?
Dennis and l'll go downstairs, and when we get down there....
The Café Rendezvous.
Where are Dennis and Jack?
Oh, they just stepped down to the patio for some fresh air.
There's plenty of fresh air on the balcony.
Well, they wanted it perfumed a little.
-What do you mean?
-Shh. l hear them now.
-We can get you in pictures.
-Oh, you can?
Why, sure.
The producer and l are just like that:
Oh, Mr. Carson. lt sounds too good to be true.
You've heard the story a thousand times.
-Star steps out of picture.
-Country girl takes her place.
-Little country girl becomes big star.
MORGAN: Your name in lights.
Houses, cars.
Oh, it sounds wonderful.
But how do l know you're telling me the truth?
The truth? lf we're not, may we never see the light of day again.
[SHATTERS]
Why, Judy. l'm sorry, but l wish it had landed on you.
And l thought you were both so wonderful.
The next man who tells me he can get me into pictures...
...l'm gonna slap him in the face. l'm taking the next train back to Gurky's Corners.
Well, how does it feel to be a nice guy?
Awful.
-Oh, porter?
-Yes, sir? l'm in Room B. l'd appreciate it if you'd keep it as quiet as possible. l'm a sick man.
Yes, sir. l'll do my best, sir.
-Can l help you, miss?
-No, thanks. l've had enough help in this town.
Oh, just a minute, please.
Thanks.

Of course, it's not going to be easy.
May be a little rough at times.
A little rough at times.
A little rough at times.
A little rough at times.
[SlNGlNG]
There's nothing rougher than love
Though poets may okay it
There's nothing tougher than love
I've got a lot of cause to say it
Love, at its best, is strictly a thrill
Manufactured
Don't wait until
Your eyes start to glow
You'll wind up fractured
There's nothing rougher than love
No matter how you slice it
There's nothing tougher than love
But if you're gonna paradise it
You'll find, like me
It's worth all the tears
The doubts and the fears
The stormy weather
Hearts and flowers
All those torch songs after hours
Love is mighty rough once you fall
But there
-Is absolutely
-Is absolutely
Nothing like it
But there
-Is positively
-Is positively
Nothing like it
But there
-Is definitely
-Is definitely
Nothing like it at all
Love is mighty rough once you fall
But there
-Is absolutely
-Is absolutely
Nothing like it
But there
-Is positively
-Is positively
Nothing like it
But there
-Is definitely
-Is definitely
Nothing rougher than love

WOMAN:
What's happening?
-What's the matter, lady?
WOMAN: Oh, you scared me awake.
Something wrong, miss?
We must've hit a bump. Oh, l'm sorry.
Porter. Oh, this is terrible.
Porter, can't you do something?
My nerves are at the breaking point.
Mine's broke, but l'll do my best, sir.

If all my dreams are not about you
Blame my absent-minded heart
It's really quite regretful
That my heart is so forgetful
When you're away
It always seems to fall apart
If I don't show I'm lost without you
Blame my absent-minded heart
Did we meet in December?
There's so much it must remember
And if I haven't said
I've loved you
From the start
Blame my absent-minded
Heart lt is.
Why didn't Morgan and Carson tell me that face had a voice like that?
Mr. Trent, you'd better not say what l think you're gonna say. l can get you in pictures.
You said it.
But wait a minute.
You don't understand.
-Oh, yes, l do.
-No, you don't understand.
She doesn't understand. l'm not the kind of man who chases after girls.
You could've fooled me.
Miss. Miss, please.
You've got a great future.
You mean, little country girl becomes a big star...
...my name in lights, cars, houses.
-Yes, that's it.
-Uh!
But wait a minute.
Should l tuck you in, sir?
[PASSENGERS LAUGHlNG]
Mind if l join you for lunch?
They won't deliver it to my dressing room anymore.
Hey, what's that you're eating?
Pot cheese and sauerkraut.
She got you, huh?
No, no, no. l just eat it because it's good for what ails you.
-Lots of vitamins in it.
-Yeah.
Lumps of vitamins.
Well, just think...
...in a couple of hours, she'll be Mrs. Jeffrey Bushdinkle.
A fate worse than death.
We'll never see her again.
[KNOCKlNG ON DOOR]
Oh, it's only you.
Well, what do you want for 1 8.50 a week, Virginia Mayo?
Everybody's a comedian.
No straight men left.
Except one. lt's from Trent.
He heard Judy sing on the train.
He's changing Mademoiselle Fifi to an American girl.
-Wants her to do the part.
-Picture's on again. l'll get my house.
They'll unchain my car.
-There's only one catch.
-What?
She changed trains and he doesn't know where she lives.
But we know.
-Gurky's Corners.
-Gurky's Corners.
-Hey, let's go tell her.
-Yeah, let's.
Let's....
Let's not, huh? lt wouldn't work anyway.
She'd probably just spit in our eye again.
What's the use of knocking ourselves out for nothing?
Yeah, it's ridiculous.
-Couple of smart guys like us.
-Yeah, silly.
Well, l'll go get myself a glass of orange juice. l'll get myself a glass of milk.
-See you later.
-Right.
[''BRlDAL CHORUS'' PLAYlNG]
Sure this is the Adams' house?
Yeah, sure, this is it.
Hurry up. l've gotta save a girl from a fate worse than death.
Hello, stranger.
Let's keep it that way.
MAN: My friends, we are here on this occasion...
...to unite two young people in marriage.
Marriage is the foundation of the home and of the family, and of all civilization. lf any of you can show good reason...
...why these young people may not lawfully be joined together...
...let him now speak or forever hold his peace.
Go ahead, yell.
Tell her she can be a big star.
You tell her. You got here first.
Do you, Jeffrey Bushdinkle, take this woman for your lawful wedded wife?
JEFFREY: l do.
Do you, Judy Adams, take this man for your lawful wedded husband?
JUD Y: l do.
By virtue of the power vested in me...
...by the sovereign state of Wisconsin, l pronounce you man and wife.
What can she see in that cornball?
Let her lead her dull little life with her dull little Jeffrey Bushdinkle.
What some girls will go for.
He's got nothing.
Nothing.

Make mine music
Make mine music
And my heart will sing
Make mine music
And it's always spring
All the world goes romancing
When melody fills the night
And even the stars go dancing
To the music of the moonlight
Make mine music
And I'll dream of you
Make mine music
And the dream comes true
Music will play the shadows away
When everything seems to go wrong
So make mine music
And life will be a song
Make mine music
Gather round me, children, and I'll tell a story
Of the mountains in the days when guns was law
When two families got disputin'
It was bound to end in shootin'
So just listen and I'll tell you what I saw
Oh, the Martins and the Coys
They was reckless mountain boys
And they took up family feudin' when they'd meet
Every durn time!
They could shot each other quicker than it took your eye to flicker
They could knock a squirrel's eye out at 90 feet
All their fightin' started one bright Sunday morning
I remember!
Cos old Grandpa Coy was full of mountain dew ...
Just as quiet as a church mouse
He stole into the Martins' henhouse
Cos the Coys, they needed eggs for breakfast too
After that they started out to fight in earnest
And they scarred the mountains up with shot and shell
There was uncles, brothers, cousins
Why, they bumped them off by dozens
Just how many bit the dust is hard to tell
Oh, the Martins and the Coys
They were reckless mountain boys
At the art of killin' they became quite deft
Mighty deft
They all knowed they shouldn't do it
But before they hardly knew it
On each side they only had one person left
Only one person left
Now, the sole remaining Martin was a maiden
And as pretty as a picture was this Grace
- While the one survivin' boy
- Was the handsome Henry Coy
And the folks all knew they'd soon meet face to face
- After her, Henry!
- Go get her, boy!
- Knock him off, Gracie!
- Shoot that Coy!
So they finally met upon a mountain pathway
And Henry Coy, he aimed his gun at Grace
Right at Grace
He was set to pull the trigger when he saw her pretty figure
You could see that love had kicked him in the face
Oh, the Martins and the Coys
They were reckless mountain boys
But they say their ghostly cussin' gives you chills
Cos the hatchet sure was buried when sweet Grace and Henry married
It broke up the best durn feud in these here hills
Come on, everybody, let's dance!
Way down yonder, not far off, a jay bird died with the whoopin' cough
Do si do, little more dough, chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough
"Granny, will your dog bite?". "No, child, no, he lost his teeth a long time ago"
Now swing your partners,
And promenade the hall,
Same old road, same old train
Watch that monkey walk that rail
Now first couple out to the right
Go round that couple and take a peek
Come back to the centre and shake your feet
Round that couple and peek once more
Back in the centre and circle four
Swing your partner and call your hound
Right foot up and left foot down
Bottom of your foot make a hole in the ground
Now you're tall with a smile
Once and a half and go hog wild
Sooey, hog, sooey!
Look at him run!
What's the hurry, Henry?
Now you may think that this is where the story ended
But I'm tellin'you them ghosts don't cuss no more
Cos since Grace and Henry wedded they fight worse than all the rest did
And they carry on the feud just like before
Roll along, blue bayou
Through the silv'ry foam
In the deep where sleepy shadows roam
While we roll, blue bayou
In your dreamy light
Memories echo in my heart tonight
I hear the echo of our song of love
Murmuring low
And here am I
Still haunted by
The ghost of long ago
Roll along, blue bayou
Through the silv'ry foam
Roll the blue and sleepy shadows home
Roll along, blue bayou
Through the silv'ry foam
In the deep where sleepy shadows roam
While we roll, blue bayou
In your dreamy light
Memories echo in my heart tonight
Roll along, blue bayou
Through the silv'ry foam
Roll the blue and sleepy shadows home
Roll along, blue bayou
Through the silv'ry foam
Roll the blue and sleepy shadows home
Across the blue moon
Boy!
Hop in the old jalop and...
Head for the malted shop and...
All the cats join in
Down goes my last two bits
Comes up one banana split
And all the cats join in
Drop your jack in the old jukebox
Play your favourite disc
When you dance with the bobby socks
You dance at your own risk
RIP
Everybody swing
Yes, swing till the rafters ring
And all the cats join in
Rafters ringing, how they're swinging
All the cats join in
I'm so lonely and blue
When I'm without you
I don't know what I'd do, sweetheart.
Without you
The joy and tears that love endears
Would have no meaning
If I didn't have you
To keep me dreaming
At the close of each day
When I'm without you
And my heart kneels to pray
I pray about you
You take a star
And lead it far away from heaven
And the star will be lost
As I'm lost without you
At the close of each day
When I'm without you
And my heart kneels to pray
I pray about you
You take a star
And lead it far away from heaven
And the star will be lost
As I'm lost without you
Oh, what a lark to ride out to the park
And just to see Casey
They travelled for miles and they stand in the aisles
And just to see Casey
The ladies don't understand baseball a bit
They don't know a strike from a foul or a hit
But when they see Casey that dame has got it
Casey, the pride of them all
The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Mudville nine that day
The score was four to two
With but one inning left to play
Listen, ya bunch of bush leaguers, it's the ninth inning!
It's the wind-up! The blow-off!
Come on, unbutton your shirts!
Now get in there and fight!
Who's up next?
Cooney!
The coach was really worried when Cooney went to bat
For all he had to offer was 300 pounds of fat
Ah, but Cooney was determined, he tried to do his worst
He kept his batting average, all right
And as usual died at first
You're out!
Hooray for our side! Hooray! Hooray!
- Aw, shut up!
- Sit down!
- I'll kick the stuffin' out of him!
- Yeah, run that guy outta town!
Barrows was the next one up, and Barrows made a hit
Wow, he smacked a beauty - right in the pitcher's mitt
You're out!
A straggling few got up to go
Ah, but the loyal fans stood pat
They'd put up even money now were Casey at the bat
Ah, but Flynn preceded Casey
Of all the stupid guys
The bat is getting in his hair
Now the hair is getting in his bat
Egad! He let drive a single - much to his own surprise
Safe!
The next one in the line-up was "No Hit" Jimmy Blake
Of all the mugs in Mudville he was the biggest fake
But he was really blazing and to the wonderment of all
Blake the Fake tore the cover off the ball
And when the dust had lifted and they saw what had occurred
There was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-huggin' third
Cosy, isn't it?
You're safe!
We want Casey! We want Casey!
We want Casey!
Oh, Casey's the guy with his eye on the ball
But mostly the ladies
Casey's the guy who's the idol of all
But mostly the ladies
Casey is mighty and manly
Casey's a dangerous gent
Egad, when he goes to bat, hang onto your hat
He's batting a thousand percent with the ladies
Oh, Casey has nerve and he knows every curve
He's no hokey-pokey
He gets away with that old double play
He's sure okey-dokey
He makes all the ladies go gaga, it's true
No wonder they swoon when he comes into view
He was the Sinatra of 1902
Casey, the pride of them all
The pitcher's nerves were jagged and his knees began to shake
Ah, can't catch me! Can't catch me!
One eye was watching Flynn and the other eye watching Blake
While the frightened pitcher ground the ball into his hip
Defiance gleamed in Casey's eye
A sneer curled Casey's lip
And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air
And Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there
Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped
"That ain't my style," said Casey
Strike one!
... the umpire said
From the benches, black with people, there went up a mighty roar
Like the beating of the ocean on a stern and distant shore
Kill him! Kill the umpire!
... yelled the cutie from the stand
And it's likely they'd have killed him
Had not Casey raised his hand
With a smile of Christian charity great Casey's visage shone
He stilled the rising tumult and bade the game go on
He signalled to the pitcher and once more the spheroid flew
But Casey still ignored it and the umpire said, quote:
Strike two!
Unquote.
"Fraud!" cried the maddened thousands, and the echo answered "Fraud!"
But one scornful look from Casey...
And the audience was awed
They saw his face grow stern and cold
They saw his muscles strain
And they knew that Casey would not let that ball go by again
The sneer has gone from Casey's lip
His teeth are clenched in hate
He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate
And now the pitcher holds the ball
And now he lets it go
And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow
Somewhere in this favoured land
The sun is shining bright
Ah, yes...
Somewhere bands are playing sweet
And somewhere hearts are light
Somewhere men are laughing
Somewhere children shout
But there is no joy in Mudville -
Mighty Casey has struck out
Casey, the pride of them all!
Whaddaya know? The game is over.
Two silhouettes
Together in the afterglow
Two silhouettes
Become as one
When lights are low
And with the night slumbering on
We'll build a dream for two
A perfect dream
Set to a theme lovely as you
Two hearts on fire
Will soon inspire
The stars to dance
The flames that stray
Will light the way
To our romance
And when I hold you in my arms
To my heart's delight
Two silhouettes will drift away into the night
Two hearts on fire
Will soon inspire
The stars to dance
The flames that stray
Will light the way
To our romance
And when I hold you in my arms
To my heart's delight
Two silhouettes
Will drift away
Into the night
Will drift away
Into the night
Now, this is the story of...
Peter and the Wolf.
As you know, in the musical score of Peter and the Wolf each character is represented by an instrument in the orchestra -
Peter by the string quartet.
The bird, whose name is Sasha, by a flute, way up high.
Sonia, the duck, by an oboe. Like this...
And here is Ivan, the cat, represented by a clarinet in a very low register.
Grandpapa is an old bassoon.
The shooting of the hunters' guns by the kettledrums.
And there is also a wolf.
Little does that wolf know what's in store for him this day.
For our hero, little Peter, armed to the teeth, is setting forth to capture him.
There seems to have been a change of plans.
For Peter's grandpapa thinks that little boys like Peter should not go out to hunt the wolf.
This is very embarrassing for a great hunter.
This is Sasha, the little bird we told you about.
Excitable little chap, isn't he?
Forgetful, too.
"Hello, Petey. Where you goin'?
Can I go, Petey? Can I?"
"Oh, boy, a gun!"
"Loaded, too. "
"Goin' hunting? Oh, that's for me!"
"Everything's OK, Petey.
Come on, let's go. "
The wolf!
But it isn't the wolf at all.
It's only Sonia the duck.
"Hello, Sonia. "
"Hello, Petey. "
Now Sonia wants to join the party.
Imagination is a wonderful thing.
But sometimes it can run away with you.
"You coward!"
Now who's this?
Oh, it can't be...
Oh, no. It's Ivan the cat.
Hello, Ivan.
Ivan's a peaceful, fun-loving sort - maybe a little shy on brains. You know the type.
Hey, look out, Sasha!
"Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it!"
Oh, how can they ever get any place if they're going to fight among themselves?
Ivan, you ought to be ashamed.
"You big bully!"
"You cat in the grass!"
Come on, Sasha. Ivan's sorry.
He won't do it again.
And so, once more, our little band of intrepid hunters sets forth to find the wolf.
And they find him.
Sonia! Sonia!
Behind you! Look out!
W-O-L-F!
Oh, that wolf is everywhere!
Peter, do something!
Oh, no.
Look, Peter, why don't you...
Maybe if you could...
Then maybe, Peter... Oh, well...
Peter, don't just stand that way.
Don't stand that way, either.
Oh, Sonia!
This is no time to relax.
Poor Sonia.
Well, that's one gone.
Goodbye, Sonia.
Will this crime go unavenged?
Not if little Sasha can help it.
You beast!
Take this! And this! And this!
How do you like this, eh?
And this, eh?
How about this, eh?
Not so good, eh?
Good work, Sasha!
Trouble.
Sasha! Sasha, get up!
Get up! Get out of there!
Look out, please, for over-confidence.
This is bad.
This is very bad.
Saved!
Just when things are looking blackest...
Hark! What's that we hear?
What's this we see?
The hunters!
Misha, Yasha and Vladimir.
That's Vladimir in the middle.
Wait a minute, I'll show you.
W-O-L-F. Wolf.
Wolf?
To the rescue!
Oh, Peter, you're safe!
You've captured the wolf.
Oh, happy day!
I think I'll say that again.
Oh, happy day!
Oh, Peter, what a hero!
You too, Ivan.
Everybody's happy - except the wolf.
But little Sasha isn't happy.
He's thinking of his lost playmate, Sonia.
Sonia...
Sonia?
Sonia! Then you're not dead!
You're safe!
Oh, Sonia, this is the most wonderful, wonderful day!
The wolf is captured - Peter caught him!
One, two, three...
Johnnie Fedora met Alice Bluebonnet
In the window of a department store
'Twas love at first sight
And they promised one night
They'd be sweethearts for evermore
Johnnie would serenade Alice
Toora-lay, toora-li, toora-lu
He sang of a beautiful palace
Of a beautiful hatbox for two
But Johnnie Fedora lost Alice Bluebonnet
To a patron of the department store
Her beauty was sought by the girl she was bought by
For twenty-three ninety-four
Johnnie, O Johnnie
Your Alice Bluebonnet
Will always be waiting for you
So don't give up hoping
And don't give up dreaming
For true love will come smiling through
Johnnie Fedora was lonely and stranded
In the window of the department store
When, lo and behold
He was suddenly sold
And his heart became gay once more
Johnnie sang out like a robin
Toora-lay, toora-li, toora-lu
To strangers he'd come up a-bobbin'
"I thought you were someone I knew "
He looked for her uptown and crosstown and downtown
From the Brooklyn Bridge to the Jersey shore
It all seemed in vain
Till he heard the refrain
Of the song Alice sang of yore
Johnnie, O Johnnie!
Your Alice Bluebonnet
Will always be waiting for you
So don't give up hoping
And don't give up dreaming
For true love will come smiling through
Johnnie kept yearning, he kept on returning
To the window of the department store
His voice became hushed
He was literally crushed
And it started to rain and pour
Each place he went he kept calling
- Toora-lay
- Toora-li
- Toora-lu
- La la la
His spirits kept falling and falling
For his Alice was nowhere in view
But hey-noni-noni, an ice man found Johnnie
And he cut him to fit on his horse's ears
'Twas done without malice
For beside him was Alice
And they lived on for years and years
Giddup!
You Johnnie Fedoras
You Alice Bluebonnets
Whenever you find yourself blue
You'll find it's June in December
If you just remember
That true love will come smiling through
That true love will come smiling through
This is how it all began
Just a little back-page item about a voice that sang at sea
And then this fantastic news appeared on the front page
And then in screaming headlines
Extra! Read all about it! Paper!
A singing whale?
- Whaddaya know ?
- Imagine that
Huh! I don't believe it
I don't believe it
For who ever heard of an operatic whale?
I don't believe it
I don't believe it
And headline followed headline
Then doctors and experts
And men of anatomical biology
Debated and argued
And quoted ichthyology
Impossible! Preposterous!
We savagely deny it
Magnificent! Miraculous!
We certainly certify it
And even the great impresario
Of the Grand Opera
Raised an eyebrow
And tried and tried to figure it out
This whale, she's maybe swallowed an opera singer.
That's it! This whale, she's a-swallowed an opera singer!
I find-a the great Signor Donatelli in-a the fish market.
I discovered the great Lilli Garli in-a the honky-tonky.
Why not I find-a the opera singer in-a the belly of a whale, huh?
I do it!
Oh, get me a great big schooner and get me a good harpooner
Photographers and reporters from all the newspapers
Publicity! Publicity!
Publicity!
Publicity, yes. But to Whitey the seagull, it was opportunity - the big opportunity for his friend Willie the whale.
There was no time to lose.
He must bring these two together.
Well, there was Tetti-Tatti now.
And Tetti-Tatti was in for a wonderful surprise.
Because Willie hadn't swallowed any opera singer, he could really sing.
Listen.
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread
Two little chillun, lyin' in bed
One of 'em sick and the other 'most dead
Called for the doctor, the doctor said
"Feed them chillun on shortnin' bread"
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread
After all these years of casting his "Shortnin' Bread" upon the waters, now at last success lay just over the waves.
Willie! Willie, look!
That's you, Willie!
He's looking for you!
It's your big opportunity.
Willie's going to be a great star.
Our Willie, going to sing grand opera.
Goodbye, my friends.
I'm off to be discovered
I'm off to be discovered
At last, the long years of patient waiting, the endless hours of faithful practice were about to be rewarded.
As Willie sped to his audition he wondered what to sing for his opening number.
What would impress this impresario?
How about a bit of Figaro?
Yes, sure, Figaro.
There she's blows! There she's blows!
Figaro.
Figaro!
Figaro!
Figaro! Figaro! Figaro!
Figaro! Figaro! Figaro! Figaro!
Figaro! Figaro! Figaro! Figaro!
Figaro!
Shoot-a de whale!
Figaro!
Figaro!
Figaro!
Hurry up, hurry up!
Rescue the opera singer!
Don't-a worry, we'll a-save you!
Bravo!
Bravissimo! Bravo!
Ah, but they hadn't heard the half of it.
They hadn't even heard a third of it.
For Willie was no ordinary singing whale.
Willie could sing in three separate voices: tenor... baritone... and bass.
Why, Willie was a singing miracle.
Let-a me up! This is the mutiny!
Mamma mia!
He's-a swallowed two opera singers!
He's-a swallowed three opera singers!
Stubborn, deluded Tetti-Tatti.
For right before his very eyes was the biggest discovery in all musical history.
Just imagine, a whale singing opera on the very stage of the Met.
Bravo! Bravissimo!
Je suis Méphisto
Roi d'enfer
Je veux...
Ta vie
I got him! I got him!
Vittoria!
Now Willie will never sing at the Met.
But don't be too harsh on Tetti-Tatti.
He just didn't understand.
You see, Willie's singing was a miracle, and people aren't used to miracles.
And you, faithful little friend, don't be too sad.
Because miracles never really die, and somewhere in whatever heaven is reserved for creatures of the deep,
Willie is still singing - in a hundred voices, each more golden than before.
And he'll go on singing, amid the applause and the cheering, forever.
Did you see that? Did you see the way he looked at that bridesmaid?
Oh, no. He was just looking around and accidentally there was a bridesmaid.
Why doesn't he look at me?
Oh, he has seen you.
Did you catch that?
- Flirting right up to the last minute.
- Oh, don't be silly.
I'll never be able to trust that girl.
Oh, I won't need you anymore today, Thompson.
- Good morning, Mrs. Kent.
- Oh, good morning.
We've booked you and Mr. Kent on the
Southern Queen sailing next Tuesday.
Good. Did you get us a stateroom on the promenade deck?
Naturally. We've also arranged for your accommodations in Rio...
...at the Hotel Atlantico.
- The presidential suite.
- Of course.
- How do you do?
- Good morning.
Don't worry, in Rio, our man will meet you at the boat and escort you to the hotel.
Fine.
Here she is again.
You take care of her, Dudley, in a nice way. I got stuck last time.
Quite a character. Comes in here every few months.
Loads up on literature, plans elaborate tours.
- Never goes on one of them.
- Really?
- Why is that? - Well, she's just a singer in a honky-tonk.
Hasn't got a dime.
I think there are some papers here for you to sign, Mrs. Kent.
- Oh, how do you do, Miss Garrett?
- Oh, greetings, chum.
My, we haven't seen you, let's see now, since you didn't go to Switzerland.
I got a big kick out of planning that.
What looks good this time of the year?
How about the Canadian Rockies?
Canadian Rockies? Don't you remember?
I already haven't been there.
Oh, of course, I'm sorry.
What about a cruise through the Canal, and return home by train from Los Angeles?
The Canal's for schmoes.
Come on, what really looks good?
Well, South America's getting a heavy play.
We have some literature on it, if you'll just step right over here.
- Sure.
- Here are the papers.
- Hello, Miss Garrett.
- Hi.
South America, the seat of ancient cultures.
Museums, missions, archeological ruins abound.
South America.
You could tell by her manana...
Manana, that fractures me.
What has South America got besides romantic ruins?
Let's see. It says here there are approximately four men to every woman-
That's enough. Doesn't hurt a girl to be outnumbered.
- Pardon me.
- Yes?
- We're set up to take your passport photo.
- Oh, thank you. I'll be right in.
As long as I'm handy, I might as well have one taken too.
But, Miss Garrett, you've already had seven passport pictures taken.
But never as a blond.
- Are you going to tell your husband?
- Oh, no, no. Not yet.
I want some time to prepare him for it. Well...
Before you go, there's just one more thing.
- Uncle. Uncle.
- Yeah.
- What happened?
- Do you see what I see?
- What do you see?
- Isn't that Elvira down there?
Now, Michael, don't tell me you are still jealous of her.
- Well, why did they raise the top?
- I don't know.
Maybe they are afraid it will rain.
Let's face it, uncle. Elvira's a flirt, always has been.
Thought marriage would change her, it hasn't.
Just the opposite, my boy.
When a woman is married, she has to flirt twice as hard...
...to prove she's still got it.
Yes?
- Yes what?
- Whom do you wish to see?
Mr. Michael Kent.
Who are you?
Oh, I'm Mr. Kent's secretary.
Oh, since when?
Since 9:00 this morning.
- Who are you?
- Mrs. Michael Kent, since three years ago.
Oh, really?
Why do you say, "Oh, really"?
Well, I didn't know
Mr. Kent was married.
Well, you've only been here since 9:00.
He couldn't have gotten very far in the story of his life.
Shall I announce you to Mich
-? I mean, Mr. Kent?
Never mind.
I'll just walk in on Mr. Ke-
I mean, Michael.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, darling.
- Your hat's on crooked.
- it's supposed to be that way.
Oh, is it?
Looks very cute. Very cute.
We'll take care of that a little later.
Who was that you just drove up with?
I was hoping you wouldn't see me.
Well, if you must know, it was an automobile salesman.
You looked so chummy, could've sworn he was a friend.
He was just showing me how the car worked.
You didn't tell me you were getting a new car.
You didn't tell me you were getting a new secretary.
Where did she come from?
Oh, from the Acme
Secretarial School, I suppose.
By the time we're back from South America, she'll be able to type with all 10 fingers.
Oh, South America.
- What's the matter, dear?
- Nothing, nothing.
Oh, excuse me.
- Mr. Kent, you wanted to see these.
- Fine.
Put them out on the whole chain.
I want everyone to smell good.
Yes, sir.
Michael, every time you say,
"Oh, uh, um" like that...
...I know there's something on your mind and not in your throat.
- What about our trip?
- Well, darling, this is it.
I'm afraid we're going to have to postpone it again.
Postpone it? Why?
- Business. Something came up this morning.
- About 9:00 this morning.
Yes, yes, about 9.
Phone call from the West.
Great chance for a merger.
Listen, marriage is a merger too, you know, and a darned important one.
I know, I know.
If we can grab the Great
Western Drug Company...
...there won't be a hot-water bottle without our name on it.
That's a comfort.
Tell J.B. to put those on a national network.
You wanted me to remind you of your lunch appointment.
Yes, thank you, Miss Medwick.
Bye-bye, dear. May see you at dinner.
Glad you see it my way.
Come along, bring your notebook.
This is not only lunch, it's business.
- Would you please sign these?
- Oh, yes, yes.
That's a wonderful perfume.
Don't believe we carry that in our stores.
- Would you mind telling me what it is?
- It's called Tonight or Never.
It's your photo. A messenger brought it from the Baker Travel Agency.
A lot of good it'll do me now.
- Maybe we'd better put it in stock.
- Oh, yes, sir.
Well, if you don't want it, I'd be glad to keep it as a souvenir.
You're sweet.
Excuse me.
Would you mind finishing?
- Hello, dear.
- Hello, Uncle Lazlo.
Your hat is on crooked.
It's supposed to be that way.
I guess you heard Michael cannot go to South America.
Uncle Lazlo, couldn't you handle this deal yourself?
No, darling, I cannot do anything without Michael.
I am the president of the company, but he is my brains in the drugstore business.
When I started in this business nobody was helping me.
No. I was a soda jerker.
I was such a thin boy, my boss was such a guy.
One mistake, I got a punch in the nose.
But now it is different.
I am the success, so he does all the work.
No, no, no, I cannot let
Michael go, not for a day.
He's the great business head.
I didn't marry Mike for his business head.
He's so attractive, but he's such a wolf.
Don't you think it's a little strange that this business deal should pop up...
...the same morning he hires a beautiful new secretary?
I know what you are insinuating, but you are 90 percent wrong.
What about the other 10 percent?
Oh, well, I'm not saying that Michael has not looked at another woman.
Who hasn't?
I have looked at women, and the few that looked back, I married.
That cured me of looking.
I will tell you what, I still like women, but I stopped looking.
Well, that isn't me.
Is there a phone number on the back? Let me see.
- A nice girl.
- I thought you'd stopped looking.
Why, I know who that is.
That's that girl in the agency.
She's quite a character.
Elvira, dear, why not forget about
Michael and take this trip yourself. Why?
And leave him here with a free hand? Oh, no.
Don't be silly.
Even if you were here...
...if Michael wanted to play around in a city like New York...
...with a little caution:
If he thought I was away, he wouldn't bother about being careful.
How I'd love to go to South
America and catch Michael here.
My dear niece, not only is it impossible, but it cannot be done.
Uncle.
- What?
- I think I have an idea.
What
-? What idea?
Get me the Baker Travel Agency, and
I wanna speak to Charles, please.
Uncle, we're going nightclubbing tonight.
Night
- Nightclubbing?
Hello, Charles. This is Mrs. Kent.
- Uncle. Uncle.
- Yes?
This is the girl.
I hope you know what you are doing.
Waiter, have you a table for two?
Sorry, no formal dress allowed.
Why?
Makes the customers feel uncomfortable.
Oh, makes them uncomfortable. And how much makes them comfortable?
You rich guys think that money can buy anything.
How right you are.
Nobody would ever suspect you love music.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
That ought to prove I'm not rude.
We now present our singing star, an Oscar Farrar discovery...
...trained by Oscar Farrar, and appearing here through the courtesy of Oscar Farrar.
Incidentally, my name is Oscar-
Seems to escape me for the moment.
Miss Georgia Garrett.
Hi, baby.
Although I'm smitten
I've never written
Any poetry at all
Not even the kind That you usually find
On a schoolhouse wall
The poems that I've composed
I could never win a cup with
After trying and trying
And trying and trying
This is what I came up with
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love with you
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love I'm in love
In love-
So she's in love.
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love with...
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love with you
- What was the name of that song?
- "I'm in Love. "
- Did I do right by you?
- You always do.
But all this is beneath me.
Marry me so I can quit this job.
I'm getting tired of turning you down.
Marry me and get yourself a dependent. I'm deductible.
Oscar, you're a sweet kid, but just a little offensive.
I always wanted to marry a girl who could tune a piano on the side.
Once and for all, will you marry me?
- Answer yes or no.
- No.
We'll continue this discussion later.
Will you see me home?
Hey, Georgia, a couple of income-tax evaders...
...want you to have a drink with them. Table seven.
I'll drink with them, but autographs are out.
- Okay.
- Captain, did they ask for me too?
No one ever asks for you.
How did a sweet kid like you ever get into this kind of a racket?
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Miss Garrett, I'm Elvira Kent.
- And this is my uncle, Lazlo Lazlo.
- Hello.
If he isn't your uncle, is that my business?
You can believe me, she's my niece. I have experiences in nieces.
- Won't you sit down?
- Don't be surprised if I do.
That's cute.
We ordered champagne if it is all right with you.
So I'm stuck with it.
Say, haven't I seen you someplace?
Baker Travel Agency.
What's more they sent me your passport photo by mistake.
The schmoes, they sent me yours. It's right in my dressing room, you want it?
- There's no hurry.
- You can keep mine. I'm not going anyplace.
Well, neither am I.
Did you run out of money too?
Oh, no, no, no. My niece cannot run out of money.
I am the owner of one of the greatest drugstore chains.
When I came in this country I was a soda jerker.
I was such a thin boy, my boss was such a guy.
One mistake, I got a punch in the nose
- No, no.
- Miss Garrett.
- Listening.
How would you like to go to South America after all?
How would I like to go to
- Oh, you mean as a stowaway?
- No.
In a first class cabin, all expenses paid, and $ 1000 spending money.
What radio program do you two represent, and how did I win it?
Oh, no, nothing to do with radio or contests or anything like that. No.
What's the catch? There must be a catch.
There is.
You see, you have to travel under my name.
- Under your name? You tired of it?
- No.
- You see, I'm married and- - Oh, ashamed of it.
No.
- Miss Garrett, I don't trust my husband.
- Natch.
If he thought I was in South America, he'd play around quite openly-
And she would be here to catch him.
Well, why not let him play around? Keeps them off the streets.
Please. This is a legitimate offer.
Yes, it is.
Do you mean after all these years of planning and dreaming...
...and never getting out of Far Rockaway...?
You mean this thing is just gonna fall right in my lap?
Right in your laps.
Well, what am I asking questions for?
- Lady, have you got yourself a deal.
- Oh, good.
- Let's drink to that.
- Wonderful.
A votre what?
- What does that mean?
- Your health.
Mine's fine, thanks. How's yours?
- Don't pack that. I'll need that in New York.
- Beg pardon?
I mean, I won't be using it in Rio.
You can stop packing, Marie.
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.
I'll finish the merger by the end of the week, and then I can go with you.
I said I'll be finished in a few days.
Aren't you happy?
Oh, yes, I certainly am.
It's just that it interferes with all my plans.
Plans? What plans?
What she means is her boat leaves tomorrow and not in a few days, you know.
But another one leaves
Saturday. That's only 96 hours.
But- But- But, darling, you can't complete a decent merger in 96 hours.
She's right. If you should mess up this deal...
- ... you'll never forgive yourself.
- Yes, I will.
Then I'll never forgive you.
- Oh, the phone. - Now, look, darling, this is-
Hello. Oh, hello, Georgia.
Oh, I can't talk to you now, dear, I'm in a hurry.
- I'll see you on the boat.
- Who's this you'll see on the boat?
- George who?
- George who?
Oh, George who? Oh, not George who...
...Georgia. Just a girlfriend of mine.
But no, darling, you stay here and take care of your affairs.
Well, this seems very funny to me.
Very funny that you can't wait till Saturday.
Only four days.
- Don't you think it's funny, uncle?
- No, it isn't funny at all.
Maybe not to you, because you have no feelings of such matters.
What
-? I have no feeling? You have no feeling.
You are talking, talking, don't know what about.
She cannot postpone her trip.
It's settled with Georgia.
What's settled? Say, who is this Georgia?
You see, you haven't the faintest notion.
Georgia is the girl who has to-
You are driving me crazy.
Elvira, don't you think you owe me an explanation?
I can't hear a word you're saying, the shower's making too much noise.
Just what are you up to?
I can't talk to you right now.
I want one reason, at least one good reason...
...why you have to go off by yourself.
I can't talk to you right now.
If I can't hear you, at least let me see you.
Now, are you gonna wait for me? Yes or no?
- Oh, hello.
- Come in.
- Excuse me, are you Peter Virgil?
- I am.
- Peter Virgil, the detective?
- Yes.
My client suspects his wife is slowly poisoning him...
...and I was just examining the evidence.
No, there's no poison. It could stand a little sugar though.
Excuse me. See I...
I figure as long as there's no poison, why, I might as well drink it.
- Would you join me in a cup of evidence?
- No, thanks.
Well, sit down. What can I do for you?
Well, you'll excuse me for being blunt, Mr. Virgil.
Tell me, Mr. Virgil...
- ... are you a good detective?
- Naturally.
- Where did you get your training?
- In the Army. Intelligence G-2.
Well, were you good at your job?
We won the war, didn't we?
Before that I was a vaudeville hoofer, wrestler, and a magician's assistant.
So you can see, I'm a man of wide experience, Mr...
Kent. Michael Kent.
See how I wormed that name out of you?
Mr. Virgil, I'm here on a very delicate matter.
- I suppose you're married?
- Yes.
I know what I'm doing is not quite the right thing-
But what you suspect your wife is doing is even worse?
The fact of the matter is, Mr. Virgil...
...my wife is leaving day after tomorrow on a South American cruise...
...and, well, she insists on going without me.
To a man of your nature, that means only one thing, another man on the boat.
See, I don't know. That's what I want you to find out.
Well, you've come to the right man.
I've handled so many of these cases. I-
Excuse me.
Hello.
Oh, yes, how are you?
Well, certainly I shadowed your wife.
I hate to tell you this, but you were right. She's been two-timing you.
Hello? Hello?
He fainted.
Sometimes there's a shot.
Now, where were we?
Mr. Virgil, I want you to get on the same boat with my wife and shadow her.
- I'll have to leave all of my business.
- I'll make it up to you.
I can tell you right now without batting an eyelash, it'll cost you $ 1000 a week.
Well, that's a little steep, isn't it, old boy?
Yes, yes, it is, but
I'll probably get seasick.
Well, all right, all right.
I'll book your passage.
Move your chair closer, will you?
There's a little confidential information I must have.
Oh, excuse me.
Hello.
Well, what do you know...
...he didn't even wait for me to tell him.
It still isn't too late.
- Can't you wait two or three weeks?
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Here I am, we're sailing any minute.
- I can get you off the boat in a while.
Will you please not worry about me? I'll be back in no time.
Yeah, I know, but I'm gonna miss you so much.
You just have the feeling that I'm always near you.
I'll try. And, darling,
I want you to remember...
...that wherever you are
I'll be watching over you.
Oh, what a lovely sentiment.
Oh, isn't that the warning whistle?
Well, I didn't hear anything. Did you, uncle?
The whistle? Yes, sure I heard.
I still hear it.
- Well, goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye.
Have fun.
Come along, uncle.
- Well, goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye. Goodbye.
I didn't lie, just the whistle is a little late.
I understand running away from me, but not on such an elaborate scale.
It was very sweet of you to come down. Goodbye.
I'll give you one more chance to explain. Where did you get the money?
- I told you.
- You didn't tell me.
- That's right, I told you I couldn't tell you.
- You treat me like an empty suit.
- Are you going with somebody?
- Scouts honor, I'm traveling alone.
That's no fun. Georgia,
I won't let you do this.
It's not only walking out on your job and me...
...once you go, you cut down my list of friends 100 percent.
- Think of that.
- I have thought about it.
That's the gratitude I get.
I taught you everything you know, gave you a career.
I picked you up when you were working for
$45 a week and gave you a job at the club.
At a snappy 40 a week.
You can't expect to start at the top, although I've often wondered why not.
Oscar, you better go. I have so many things to do before we sail.
I know when I'm not wanted.
It happens to me constantly.
Oscar.
Aren't you gonna kiss me?
I don't know how. Will you show me?
You don't know how either.
B flat, that's your key.
Don't forget to put your shoes in front of the cabin every night.
- Be sure to write.
- I will.
- You sure you're not going with somebody?
- Goodbye, Oscar.
- You're sure everything's gonna be all right?
- Don't worry.
I want you to write me every chance you get.
If what I have can't go through the mails...
- ... I'll phone you.
- All right.
I've had a lot of these.
- I hope what I'm doing is all right.
- You're all right.
- Everything's all right.
- Okay.
- Oh, excuse me.
- Sorry.
Should I wait for you?
No, you'd better go with
Michael. He might get suspicious.
Come in.
- All clear?
- Nobody here but my uncle.
And I am practically gone already.
Have a nice trip, my da
- Oh, pardon me.
You have a
- Oh, excuse me.
- See you later.
- All right.
- Good luck to you.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- You all right?
Oh, you don't know what a tough time
I had getting rid of my boyfriend.
I'm beat.
Georgia
- I mean, Elvira, because that's gonna be your name...
...for the next few months.
Please be careful of your speech.
Mrs. Kent may be fatigued, but she's never beat.
Okay, I'm fatigued, but my feet hurt.
Michael.
Michael. I thought I lost you.
Well, you see, I was just seeing a friend about some business in South America.
Well, goodbye, Georgia. Best of luck.
I hope you have a wonderful trip.
- Thanks.
- And I almost forgot to tell you, I overtip.
- Okay. It's your money.
- That's right.
Now let me see, checked the passenger list, nobody knows me.
So far so good.
Now here.
I've written letters to my husband addressed from various ports.
Please be sure to mail them one by one at each place you stop.
- That ought to convince him.
- It's a cinch.
Well, goodbye again and good luck to you.
Oh, I almost forgot the most important thing.
How do you feel about men?
They're grand. I mean, they're the most important thing.
With your figure and my name, the men will be flocking after you.
Say, that's happened to me plenty under my own name.
Well, just remember, while your lips are being kissed...
...it's my reputation that's suffering.
- Yeah, I'll make a note of that.
- Good.
Oh, dear, I'm liable to be trapped on the boat.
- Well, goodbye, Georgia.
- Goodbye.
I hope you make me very proud of me.
I'll try.
Oh, do me a favor, have a wonderful time...
...but please stay in your cabin as much as possible and as alone as possible.
I'll make a note of that too and underline it.
Bye.
All ashore that's going ashore.
What's the matter with you?
- What's the matter with you?
- I think I forget.
- Forget what? - I for-
Nothing at all.
I think I get seasick.
- The ship isn't even moving.
- Why didn't you tell me that?
Late for work, aren't you?
Could you tell me what table
Mrs. Elvira Kent has reserved?
Table 64. Is that where you're stationed?
- What do you mean?
- Aren't you a new waiter?
Me? Certainly not. I'm a passenger.
I've got one of the most luxurious cabins on the boat.
- I beg your pardon.
- You should.
If I were not a headwaiter,
I'd be flustered.
- What gave you the idea I work here?
- It was a mistake.
You see, onboard, no one dresses the first night out.
Well, what's good enough for you is good enough for me.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
- My dear young lady.
- Yes?
I advise you to go to your cabin and get out of your clothes.
- Pardon?
- Don't go in there.
- You'll be frightfully embarrassed.
- Embarrassed? Why?
- Nobody dresses the first night out.
- They don't?
Even if it's chilly?
This I gotta see.
- You mean nobody dresses up.
- Of course. Didn't you know that?
Then what are you doing in that monkey suit?
Confidentially, this is my first trip too.
- Really?
- Yes.
My dear man, I've been on more world cruises than you could shake a stick at.
It's just that compared to my other gowns, I don't consider this very formal.
Is that so?
Well, if you don't consider that formal,
I'd like to see the rest of your wardrobe.
- Mrs. Elvira Kent.
- In particular, I have one little item...
- ... that's backless, strapless...
- Mrs. Kent.
- ... almost frontless.
- Mrs. Kent.
Mrs. Elvira Kent.
Oh, my goodness. Mrs.
Elvira Kent, that's me.
Hey, boy.
- Are you Mrs. Kent?
- Natch. I mean, naturally.
- Radiogram.
- Oh, thank you.
- Just a moment.
- May I?
No, no, I'll take care of it. Thank you very much.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
- That's all right.
I'm told I overtip.
Really?
- Would you excuse me, please?
- Yes, certainly.
"Don't dress first night out. " Now she tells me.
Mrs. Kent, now that I know your name, perhaps it's fair you should know mine.
- Immaterial.
- It's Peter Virgil.
I was wondering if you're as hungry as Mr. Virgil.
I could eat a cow.
Well, then our dress notwithstanding, will you have dinner with me?
If I'm overdressed, I might as well overeat.
Unless you've some other dinner engagement?
Oh, no, no, no.
Oh, now, surely you must have some friends onboard.
I don't mean male friends.
I mean, girlfriends often go on cruises together.
I don't know a soul on this tub.
Except Mr. Peter Virgil.
Well then, chin up, eyes straight ahead, and what care we if the peasants stare.
Carry on.
Oh, waiter.
Come here. Table for two, please.
I'm sorry, the dining room's just been closed.
What do you mean closed?
First you ritz me, then you try to starve two perfectly good paying customers.
The man is only doing his duty.
- After all, it's our fault that we dawdled.
- Did we dawdle?
Just the same, thanks ever so.
Why don't you try the cocktail lounge? The pretzels are delicious.
That's an excellent suggestion. I'm famished.
- More pretzels, please.
- More pretzels. Yes, sir.
Yes, thank you.
Tell me, Mr. Virgil, what business are you in?
I stick my nose into other people's business.
- You know how it is when a man's retired.
- Retired? Retired from what?
I made my fortune in the entertainment business.
Oh, really?
I invented a new system for clearing audiences out of theaters.
- You're cute. You know something?
- Thank you. What?
- I've always had an ambition to be a singer.
- Is that so?
Most singers have secret ambitions to be society dames.
I don't see why you're wasting your time with a married woman...
- ... when there's many attractive single girls.
- Oh, yes, yes.
The single girls look for husbands, while married women run from their husbands.
Frankly, I'd rather be with those that are running than with those that are looking.
Don't you want to be married?
Well, most husbands I know speak very poorly of marriage.
- What of your marriage?
- Would you believe it?
- I haven't felt married.
- Yours must be a very unusual marriage.
It certainly is.
I think we had quite enough dinner, thank you.
What would you like to do now?
I wish I could.
Isn't that lovely?
- Hello.
- Good evening.
- Oh, and you do sing?
- A little.
- You know this song?
- Yes.
- Could you raise it a little, please?
- Sure. B flat, fellas.
It's you or no one for me
I'm sure of this Each time we kiss
The lady's in love
Now and forever And when forever's done
You'll find that you are still the one
- Please
- The lady said please
Don't say no to my plea
'Cause if you do
Then I'm all through
There's this about you
My world's an empty world without you
It's you or no one
She don't want no one
It's you or no one for me
Baby, you're the one for me
- I shouldn't have done that.
- I won't report you to the Social Register.
I'm bored with it all, strictly entre nous.
I wish I didn't have to keep up appearances.
Oh, I'm tired of pretending too.
Let's both let our hair down.
Let's follow our impulses wherever they lead and make this a real vacation.
I think you've got something there.
- May I?
- Of course.
Anything above the third rib I consider formal.
- Mrs. Kent?
- Yes?
- I mean, Elvira.
- Yes?
May I see you to your cabin?
- Well- - For you, Mrs. Kent.
Thank you. Would you tip him, please?
- Yes.
- I overtip.
Oh, yes, of course. That's right.
Well?
No, thank you, Mr. Virgil.
I'll find my way alone.
So nice meeting you. Good night.
- Really?
- Yes.
The tourist trade, the tourist trade
Aye, it's all for the tourist trade
We never sunbathe Tell you why
It's atmosphere for the passerby
To find us asleep in the shade
It's so very necessary
Aye, the tourist trade
The tourist trade, the tourist trade
Aye, it's all for the tourist trade

Hello, New York?
Havana calling Mr. Michael Kent.
Plaza 43444.
Desires to reverse charges.
Reverse charges?
Just one moment, please.
Havana calling, Mr. Kent.
Wishes to reverse the charges.
Oh, yes. I'll accept it.
Hello.
Yes, yes, I'll accept the charges.
- Hello. Who?
- It's me, Peter Virgil.
We're in Havana. I thought
I'd call and give you the news.
Yes, yes, of course.
Well, what is the news?
- No news.
- What do you mean "no news "?
She hasn't looked at another man.
Professionally, I'm very disappointed.
Well, personally, I'm not.
You mean she hasn't spoken to another man?
Well, she's spoken to me.
What? You two know each other already?
Well, naturally, I had to make her acquaintance.
Well, was it difficult?
Tell me, who spoke first?
I did
- Look, don't worry.
The slogan of my firm is
"Never kiss a client's wife. "
Well, don't change slogans in mid-ocean.
- Hello, is this Mrs. Elvira Kent?
- Yes.
It is? Well, this is
Mrs. Elvira Kent speaking.
Oh, excuse me, this is
Georgia, Georgia Garrett.
I'm taking my work so seriously I don't know who I am.
Good. Have you been sticking close to your cabin?
Have I? I've only spoken to one man, and he's harmless, quite.
I thought I warned you about that.
I figured if I don't speak to any men at all, it's sure to attract attention to me.
Oh, by the way, Mrs. Kent,
I know it's not my business...
...but have you got anything on your husband?
I'm afraid his conduct has been impeccable.
- Caught him with the goods.
- That means he's been behaving himself.
Too bad. Well, maybe he'll do something unimpeccable before I come back.
Goodbye. And look, keep in touch with me, will you?
Okay. Goodbye.
I thought you were waiting outside.
Well, I suddenly remembered
I had to call New York.
- Girlfriend, huh?
- No, no, business. And you?
I was calling New York too.
- Boyfriend, huh?
- Better than a boyfriend. My husband.
- You were talking to your husband just now?
- I just hung up.
- Does that surprise you?
- Yes, it certainly does. I-
Poor darling. He was home waiting for my call.
He's quite a treasure. I think I'll send him a letter.
Well, don't you have to write it first?
Oh, no, I'm way ahead on my letter writing.
Bless his heart.
- Look, do you see a doorway over there?
- Sure.
- Do you hear somebody singing?
- Sure.
Well, then I guess I'm not crazy.
Shall we absorb some of the local color?
Let's.
Table for two, please.
Bring us a couple of drinks of something tall and cool.
Oh, Havana. Isn't it romantic?
You know, you amaze me.
You made this trip 100 times, yet you make it sound like it's the first.
You know what my secret is?
- No, what?
- No.
No, come on, tell me.
Well, I keep telling myself this is my first trip.
Pedro, you must teach me that song.
Oh, you speak Spanish.
Just like a native.
We have so many requests for this song. And I have some English lyrics.
- Oh, thank you.
- Will be 25 cents, please.
The tourist trade.
Aye, the tourist trade.
You sigh, the song begins
You speak and I hear violins
It's magic
The stars desert the skies
And rush to nestle in your eyes
It's magic
Without a golden wand
Or mystic charms
Fantastic things begin
When I am in your arms
When we walk hand in hand
The world becomes a wonderland
It's magic
How else can I explain those rainbows
When there is no rain?
It's magic
Why do I tell myself
These things that happen
Are all really true?
When in my heart I know the magic
Is my love for you
Gee, now, that's a beautiful song.
It's magic
There's something about the way you sing,
I don't know, it does something to me.
It's magic
Why do I tell myself
These things that happen
Are all really true?
- When in my heart I know
- When in my heart I know
- The magic is my love for you
- The magic is my love for you
Here you are.
- Will you have dinner with me tonight?
- Why not?
We've had it together every night so far.
- Just a moment, sir.
- I gotta catch that boat.
Your tickets.
Don't you trust me?
Your table or mine?
Say, I've got an idea.
What about table nine?
- Table nine?
- That's in a nice dark corner.
- Georgia.
- What's the matter?
Nothing. If I'm gonna be ready in time,
I'd better start dressing right now.
- Wait a minute. What's the hurry?
- I'll see you later.
Georgia.
May I help you, sir?
Well, you're not exactly my type, but you can take my bags.
- Good evening, madam.
- Good evening.
- Did you give the message to Mr. Virgil?
- Yes, madam.
I told him that you weren't having dinner because you were indisposed.
- Thank you.
- Yes, madam.
- Did you bring a little herring?
- Yes, madam. Marinated.
The purse is right over there, help yourself.
It's all right, I overtip.
Thank you so much, ma'am.
- Who is it?
- It's me, Peter. How do you feel?
Terrible. Just terrible.
Well, we'll fix you right up. I brought a doctor.
I don't need a doctor. I just want to be left alone.
But I can't stand in this passageway all night, young lady.
It's drafty, and I'm catching cold.
Take two aspirins and go to bed.
Thank you very much. It sounds like a very good idea. I'll do that.
But first, I'll have to examine you.
It might be something contagious, you know.
All right, doctor. Just a minute.
Come in.
You better stay outside. We don't want to start an epidemic.
Now, tell me, where does it hurt?
Everywhere.
Oh, well, then, I suppose we should start looking someplace.
- Yes, let me see your tongue.
- What's the matter?
Oh, I get dizzy when I bend. I must be coming down with something.
Oh, thank you very much, yes.
Oh, may I feel your pulse?
Yes.
You might as well feel mine.
If you'd be so kind. Thank you.
Yes, your pulse is normal.
Yours is fast.
I was sure of it.
Well, I suppose I ought to tap something.
- Here.
- Oh, thank you so much.
Now say, "Ah. "
- My diagnosis was correct.
- What do you recommend, doctor?
- A sea voyage. - A sea-
But then we're on one, aren't we? I'm so sorry. How silly of me.
I'll give you an injection and put you to sleep.
That shouldn't do you any harm.
Will it hurt, doctor?
Well, it shouldn't, but
I'm a bit clumsy, you know.
- Couldn't I just read myself to sleep?
- No, I'm afraid not. Now just one moment.
I feel faint.
Who got jabbed, me or you?
I seem to smell food odors.
That's always a bad sign.
And herring too.
Why do I smell herring?
I guess there's a school of herring following the ship.
No, no, not marinated herring.
I don't feel so hot.
I think I better be going.
- Good night, doctor.
- Good night.
- And I hope I sleep well.
- I hope so.
Well, doctor?
Yes, she'll live, but I can't make any prediction about myself.
- Would you mind helping me to my cabin?
- Not at all. Is something wrong?
Thank you very much. No, I don't feel too good. I sort of...
- Oh, mess boy.
- I'm the purser. What can I do for you?
There's something wrong with your list.
You haven't got Georgia Garrett listed.
- What was that name?
- Georgia Garrett.
Georgia as in marching through.
Garrett as in starving in.
I'm sorry, if she isn't listed, she's not onboard.
Don't be coy. I've been chasing her all over the ship.
Tell me, do you know this tomato?
Why certainly. This toma-
This lady is Mrs. Michael Kent.
Oh, she's Mrs. Kent now.
- And what is Mrs. Kent's stateroom? - Twenty-three, B deck.
Thank you. Take the next two weeks off.
Sure
- What?
I haven't eaten all day.
Come in.
Oscar, how'd you get on this boat?
- I lied about my age.
- You chooch.
- You followed me here, huh?
- That's right.
I was sitting alone in a restaurant...
...the waiter put down a check, and you weren't there to pick it up.
Oscar, please go away.
Incidentally, I picked up your last two paychecks.
It was barely enough to pay for my plane ticket.
Didn't even leave me enough to buy you a present. I feel like a cad.
You crook. You can go to jail for that.
Marry me and you won't have to testify.
I'm so sleepy.
And you know I don't love you.
I don't know whether to believe what I'm hearing or what I'm feeling.
Where's the radio room?
- Top deck, sir, next to the lounge.
- Thanks.
I have all the seductive powers of a sedative.
You chooch.
Will you please send this radiogram at once? And send it collect.
Good morning.
Well, good morning.
Good morning. I use the expression loosely.
- How are you?
- I feel just fine.
You'd be interested to know that I feel fine too.
- I was sure you would.
- I wanna thank you.
- You left me in good hands last night.
- Yes, yes, I saw as much.
- That doctor sure gets results.
- Of course, sometimes he needs help.
That specialist that was called in on the case after.
Specialist?
Can you explain to me why that man was in your cabin kissing you?
- No.
- Well?
Well, can you explain why you were watching my cabin?
- No.
- Well?
- Well, maybe-
- Maybe what?
Well, maybe I'm narrow-minded.
But I don't like married women who play around.
- What if the other man was you?
- That's beside the point.
- It is, is it?
- Yes, it is.
Everything they've said about women like you on boats like this turned out to be true.
- Or don't you follow me?
- I've wanted to, Peter, anywhere, anytime.
Well, don't.
- Peter, you can't mean that. - I ca-
I've only one thing to say to you, Mrs. Kent...
...I would certainly hate to be Mr. Kent.
You chooch.
- Good morning, madam.
- Good morning.
I'd like to get higher than a kite.
Yes, madam. What shall it be?
I don't know, I don't drink.
Well, how about cherry
Never mind. I'll get my kicks my way. Just forget it.
- Hi, fellas.
- Hi.
- Why so glum?
- I don't know. I'm in the mood, I guess.
- Bright or blue?
- You start it, I'll finish it.
You can take the moon
Gather up the stars And the robins that sing merrily
Put 'em in a box
Tie 'em with a ribbon And throw 'em in the deep blue sea
You can take the flowers
Down in Lovers' Lane
And that sentimental poetry
Put 'em in a box
Tie 'em with a ribbon And throw 'em in the deep blue sea
Not for me all that stuff
The dreams that ruin your sleep
Not for me Had enough
Love is one thing you can keep
You can take the plans
And the wedding bells
And whoever sings "Oh, Promise Me"
Put 'em in a box
Tie 'em with a ribbon And throw 'em in the deep blue sea
'Cause love and I we don't agree
The hansoms through the park
The kisses in the dark
All the promises made faithfully
Put 'em in a box
Tie 'em with a ribbon And throw 'em in the deep blue sea
And you won't go wrong
If you take a song
Sung by Frankie boy or Mr. C
Put 'em in a box
Tie 'em with a ribbon
And throw 'em in the deep blue sea
Not for me all that stuff
The dreams that ruin your sleep
Not for me Had enough
Love is one thing you can keep
In the icebox
You know what you can do
With good old "Tea for Two "
And the girl for you, the boy for me
Put 'em in a box
Tie 'em with a ribbon
Throw 'em in the deep blue sea
- 'Cause love and I we don't agree
- At all
- 'Cause love
- Love
And I We don't agree
Thanks, fellas. Excuse me.
That was fun.
So it's you.
I accept that as a greeting.
Very funny. Oscar, what do you want?
For one thing, I'd like to get this Mrs. Kent business straight.
- Oh, please, why don't you go home?
- I can't swim.
If you really love me, you'll pretend not to know me.
Listen, I didn't come all this way and spend all your money to pretend I don't know you.
Does that instrument interfere with your work?
- You're in some kind of trouble, aren't you?
- The worst kind of trouble.
Oscar, I'm in love.
- Don't you think you're being forward?
- Not with you.
That was a short romance.
It's all so complicated.
You remember the night when that classy couple asked me to have a drink?
They turned out to be Mrs. Elvira Kent and her uncle, head of a drugstore chain.
What a deal they threw my way.
A chance to cash in on all my dreams, so I accepted.
My first night onboard, I met him.
There must be something about salt air, he looked so wonderful to me.
By the time we reached
Cuba, I was in love with him.
Head over heels, if you know what I mean.
Oh, Havana was heaven.
And all the time I had to pretend that who I was, I wasn't.
Then, this morning, what does he give me? The gate, hinges and all.
So here I am. He thinks I'm married.
If I kiss him, I lose him.
On the other hand, if I tell him the truth, who will he hate most, a cheat or a phony?
I know you're phony, and I don't hate you.
You don't know what it's like to want someone.
Don't I? Oh, well...
...I guess I'll just have to bury myself in my work.
- Is that your "Brooklyn Rhapsody"?
- Who said anything about Brooklyn?
It's now the "Caribbean
Rhapsody. " I'm adaptable.
- Have you finished?
- I don't want to.
People will like it, they'll make a big fuss over me.
I'll be the toast of the town. Then what happens to that boy you and I love?
Aren't you being modest? I have confidence in you, Oscar.
Everybody has confidence in me. That's my trouble.
In high school, I was voted the boy most likely to succeed.
In college, they said I had a brilliant future.
I wonder what ever became of me?
It's you
Or no one for me
I'm sure of this
Each time we kiss
Now and forever
And when forever's done
You'll find that you are still
The one
Please don't say no
To my plea
'Cause if you do
Then I'm all through
There's this about you
My world's an empty world
Without you
It's you or no one
For me
It's magic.
You know, that's a mighty dangerous song.
And this night isn't helping any either.
It's one for the books.
Just like they said in the folder.
They didn't leave anything out tonight. Breeze, moon, stars.
And all working overtime.
Makes a man feel-
Wants a woman in his arms.
And vice versa.
- If only you weren't married.
- How I wish I could tell you I wasn't.
How easy it would be if you weren't married, I'd take you in my arms.
- Like how?
- Like this.
- Then what? - On your lips, I'd- I'd plant a kiss.
Such as?
But then you have a husband.
And you have principles.
- Elvira.
- Yes, Peter?
Something I've gotta do. I can't help myself.
Well, if you can't help yourself, you can't help yourself.
I gotta send a cablegram.
Another radiogram to be sent at once.
Send that one collect too.
You'll let me know how it comes out, won't you?
Mrs. Kent, a message from Mr. Farrar.
I have a message for you from Mr. Virgil.
I'm first. Mr. Farrar would like you to join him at the Flambio for dinner.
That's my message.
Mr. Virgil said he had to go ashore to make a call...
...and would you meet him at the Flambio?
- Flambio?
- Flambio.
In Trinidad, in Trinidad
The women are good But the liquor is bad
In Trinidad, in Trinidad
The women are good But the liquor is bad
May we sing you a song, sir?
Not about a good woman.
There's no such thing.
Run when you see a pretty woman.
When you sing calypso, you don't say, "When you see a pretty woman. "
When you see a pretty woman.
- When you see a pretty woman?
- That's right.
You sing, we'll follow you.
What can I lose that
I haven't already lost?
Run, run, run
When you see a pretty woman
Run, run, run
When you see a pretty woman
Love is the common enemy
The moon and the stars are the artillery
When they attack You'll find there's no retreat
You will lose your heart
Unless you use your feet
Oh, run, run, run
When you see a pretty woman
Run, run, run
When you see a pretty woman
I know a girl whose kiss was warm
I never thought that it could do me harm
There never was a better girl like her
But her husband Was professional wrestler
Oh, run, run, run
When you see a pretty woman
Run, run, run
When you see a pretty woman
Woman say come in out of rain
More better you stay out in the hurricane
You catch a cold But it is worth the pain
Better off catch cough
Than catch a ball and chain
Oh, run, run, run
When you see a pretty woman
Run, run, run
When you see a pretty woman
Tropical heat is very bad
Has played dirty trick
On many nice young lad
The brain go flip The heart is go flip-flop
Woman blow you kiss And then you blow your top
Oh, run, run, run
When you see a pretty woman
Run, run, run
When you see a pretty woman
Run, run, run When you see...
Oh, I beg your pardon. I didn't see you coming back there.
- Go in after me.
- After you.
I insist, please.
- All right, fine.
- Thank you.
- You on the same boat?
- Yeah, the Southern Queen.
Good evening. What is your pleasure?
- A double.
- A double what?
Double anything.
- And you, sir?
- The same.
Women.
I agree with you 100 percent.
They're a bad influence on a man.
Not only that, but they're habit-forming.
You know, I can't think of one single good thing to say about them.
That's a mighty smooth drink.
Another.
Me too. Only this time, make mine a triple.
A triple, sir. Very good.
Who said you can't live with them and without them?
The same guy who said more truth than poetry...
...and I wouldn't care to meet either of them.
The cause of all human suffering, you know.
To think that we gave up a perfectly good rib.
And not that they appreciate it.
What does yours look like?
Well...
- Funny, mine looks exactly the same.
- Yeah?
- I drink to your woman.
- I drink to yours.
- One more for me.
- I likewise.
- I'm beginning to feel those drinks.
- Me too. Should have had something to eat.
Yeah, that's always a good idea.
Is yours a blond too?
This season. I've loved her as a brunette, a brownette, and a redhead.
A little peroxide will never come between us.
Speaking about figures, curves?
Curves?
When you put your arm around her waist you gotta go into second.
What color are her eyes?
Now, I never could tell.
Every time I look into them, I get dizzy.
My experience exactly.
Hey, we could be talking about the same girl.
What's your girl's name?
- Georgia. Georgia Garrett.
- Georgia Garrett.
No, no, that's a different girl.
Mine's gonna be here any minute.
- I want you to meet her.
- Mine will be here too.
I bet they'll like each other at first sight.
While waiting, what do you say we have another drink?
Just the thing. Yes, sir.
Fill them up again, bartender.
That is a wonderful suggestion.
I came through, didn't I?
Boy, you can say that again.
- I come through.
- Yes, sir.
Of course, the rub is that mine is married.
How about yours, is yours a Mrs.?
At the moment.
I don't know about you...
- ... but I'm really getting a little high.
- So am I.
I don't know what he puts in those drinks, but he's really won me over.
Dare we try another?
Second the motion.
Coming right up.
- Oh, waiter.
- Yes, miss.
Do you see those two gentlemen sitting at the far end of the bar?
- Yes.
- Would you be so kind...
...and give them these messages?
Thank you.
- Here you are.
- Keep the change.
- Thanks.
- I'm not leaving till I get this recipe.
Excuse me. The lady send this.
The lady send this.
What do you know, she's standing me up.
Yeah? Well, shake hands.
Mine isn't coming down either.
I'll show her. I've got a good mind to catch a plane to New York.
Maybe I ought to go to New York myself.
I'm certainly not doing any good here.
- You mind if I go with you?
- Have you got two tickets?
Oh, I got better than that.
In that case, be my guest.
Steady, steady, steady.
They'll never let us on that plane if we're drunk.
You know, these slanting floors will never be popular.
Peter. Peter.
Good morning, Mr. Virgil, it's 9:15.
Lovely day, temperature normal.
Hey, you, you've had your beauty rest. Come on, get-
Are you looking for the gentleman?
- Do you know where Mr. Virgil is?
- He didn't return to the ship.
We received a radiogram from him and Mr. Farrar.
- Mr. Farrar too?
- Yes, madam.
They said they were taking a plane to New
York, and would we forward their baggage.
Thank you.
Thank you, madam.
Fasten your safety belts, please.
Fasten your safety belts, please.
Sorry, sir, but will you fasten your safety belt, please?
- Yes, sure.
- We're landing in Rio in a few minutes.
- What? Where did you say?
- Rio.
Hey, Peter, wake up.
- Wake up. - Wha-?
Hey, one thing I'll say about that Trinidad liquor.
- Not a sign of a hangover.
- Maybe this will bring it on.
- That stewardess says we're landing in Rio.
- Rio?
She's probably just not used to flying.
Would you mind looking out the window?
- Didn't you ask for tickets to New York?
- I certainly did. In my best Spanish too.
But the official language in Trinidad is English.
Do you suppose that had anything to do with it?
These all from the Southern Queen?
No, there is another car coming.
Cigarette? Be my guest if it doesn't run into too much dough.
After you.
Thank you.
Hey, we can check right now.
Here's the bulletin board.
Due today, Southern Queen.
We better claim our baggage before they ship it back to New York.
Yeah. Well, look, you go, will you? My girl's onboard.
- She'll think I'm running after her.
- My girl's onboard too.
- Let's make them both suffer.
- Calling Mr. Virgil.
- Calling Mr. Virgil.
- Hey, Virgil, that's me.
Pardon, there is a phone call for you from New York.
- You can take it on the house phone here.
- New York?
New York?
Tell them to transfer my unemployment insurance down here.
Hello.
Hello. Hello, Virgil?
Well? What's happened?
Well, how have you been?
How's the weather up there?
Listen, I didn't call you 5000 miles to discuss the weather.
- It's a very nice day here.
- That's funny, it's a nice day here too.
Never mind that. Why haven't you called me in all this time?
Well, that's
- That's because I didn't want to give you the bad news.
Bad news? What's the bad news?
Hold on for a minute. Something new has just developed.
Elvira.
Peter.
Hello? Hello?
- I don't know what to say- - How silly for you to try to run away.
- Think of the time we've wasted.
- Those few days made me realize...
- ... that you don't really love your husband.
- Not another word about my husband.
- Would it be wrong if I said I loved you?
- It would be wrong if you didn't.
Aren't you gonna introduce me?
Darling.
Always thinking of your own selfish pleasures. I'll try the other shoulder.
Darling, this is my boon drinking companion, Oscar Farrar.
Oscar, this is Elvira Kent.
How do you do, Mr. Farrar? You can't imagine my feelings at meeting you.
In that case, try to imagine mine.
Say, Oscar, is she anything like your girlfriend that you were telling me about?
You mean Georgia?
Oh, no, not at all.
Well, I have to phone down about the baggage.
- Phone? Oh, excuse me.
- Oh, thanks, Oscar.
Do you feel you're growing away from me?
- You're a peach. Thank you.
- I'm used to that.
- Hello, Mr. Kent.
- Virgil, what took you so long?
Believe me, it was in the line of duty.
Listen, Virgil, what's been happening with my wife?
- Plenty.
- Well...
Well, tell me. I'm a grown man. How bad is it?
Pretty bad. I'm a grown man too, and I hope it gets worse.
This connection must be bad.
I can't understand what you're babbling about.
But whatever it is, do something to stop her.
I'm going crazy here.
Mr. Kent, I've been taking your money under false pretenses.
I'd advise you to give me my two weeks notice.
Goodbye.
- Yes, Mr. Kent?
- Miss Medwick, get me my broker.
Call Randall. I want to check the changes in the routine shipping report.
Also get the wire that came yesterday concerning the Canadian merger.
Anything new, Humphrey?
No, ma'am. It all looks very businesslike and proper to me.
Let me for a minute. Excuse me.
He's talking to her.
So she's going out of the room without even looking backward.
You can go to lunch, Humphrey.
After all these weeks, you'd think he'd give her a pinch or a pat.
On the shoulder, I mean.
You sound disappointed that he hasn't.
I think I'll see what else is happening.
- Wait a minute.
- You know, it's very irritating.
Here I give up a wonderful cruise to trap my husband and what happens?
Nothing.
Just goes to show you can't trust men.
And that girl is having a perfectly wonderful time under my name.
I haven't heard a thing from her.
Who knows what's going on there.
Just goes to show you can't trust women either.
The best thing you can do, Elvira, is to get on the first plane to Rio.
What for?
Then you can phone Michael to join you, and you can take the boat back together.
Half a cruise with a whole husband is better than no cruise with no husband.
Maybe you're right. Come on, let's go.
Oh, and this one too.
- You know what to do while I'm gone.
- Yes.
The car is downstairs.
Your bags are in it.
Thank you. I'll be right with you.
Get some displays pushing hair tonic and triple malts.
- Yes.
- Miss Medwick, you'll pack those too.
If anything comes up, wire me at the Hotel Atlantico.
- Yes.
- Here's your briefcase.
- Thank you.
- And bon voyage. We'll all miss you.
- Thanks. Where have you been?
- Hello.
I was seeing a lady friend of mine off at the airport.
- You can see me off too. I'm leaving for Rio. - For Rio-? When?
I have a chartered plane waiting.
Is that as fast as going by regular airlines?
Much faster. I want to get there as soon as possible.
Michael, you have company.
I'm going with you.
Oh, Michael.
Good, good, good. But
I'm not interested.
What can I do with that type of music in my show?
Mr. Plinio, take my advice, as one musician to another, you need me.
Mr. Farrar, as one businessman to another, I can't afford you.
You can't afford me? Why, money's of the utmost indifference to me.
- All I want is a chance to play.
- That's not the point.
I'm spending a fortune to redecorate this place so I can reopen for the Carnival.
And to get my investment back, I need an attraction. A real attraction.
I need someone with a name.
What do you think my mother gave me, a number?
Let me play it again.
Very generous of you, but I can't use it.
That's what I admire about you, you have such an open mind.
Maybe you'd like it better if I set lyrics to it.
In your eyes
It's magic
I wish those amateurs would stop interfering with a serious musician.
Say, I know that voice.
Fantastic things begin
When I am in your arms
When we walk hand in hand
She not only sounds good, she looks good.
Take it from me, that girl has all sorts of talent.
Do you want to sign her up?
She could be the finest singer, but if she hasn't got a name...
What do you mean?
Why, that's Mrs. Elvira Kent...
...one of the classiest society dames in New York.
Mrs. Elvira Kent?
Why, when she came out, she made all the other debutantes look like social climbers.
- A society singer.
- Right, and very talented.
- That would be something new.
- Want me to talk to her?
Oh, no. You wouldn't know how to handle an important lady like that.
I'll... I'll talk to her.
Mrs. Kent, you will not be angry with me?
Why should I be angry with you?
I was about to offer you a contract to sing in my Casino Room.
Beg your pardon?
I knew you would be offended, but it's a good proposition, $ 1000 a week.
A thousand bucks
-? Dollars. For me?
Of course, it's obviously nothing for a lady in your position...
- ... but if I said a thousand, I can say 2500.
- Are you kidding?
Once you say 2500, it's not difficult to say 5000.
After you pay your taxes here and in
United States, it will cost you very little.
I'll tell you what I'll do, Mr. Plinio,
I'll sing for you for 1000 a week.
- What?
- But not as Elvira Kent.
Well, suppose I took another name. Any name.
Let's say Georgia Garrett.
What's wrong with that?
Listen, if you use a name like Georgia
Garrett and sang like an angel even...
...I could still shoot llamas in the balcony.
But if I had Mrs. Elvira Kent...
Did I say 5000? I mean seven.
Okay. I'll do it.
Wonderful. Wonderful.
It's no accident that I happen to have the contract right with me.
- What a coincidence.
- Here.
Senora, I predict that you are going to be the greatest attraction I ever had.
- I know she will.
- Thank you.
I'm sorry that your husband will not be here to see you.
Oh, I'm so sorry too, but he's such a busybody.
Goodbye. See you later.
Goodbye.
- How do you do?
- How do you do, sir?
Where can I find Mr. Peter Virgil?
Mr. Peter Virgil? I believe you'll find him in the Casino Room.
- Thank you.
- I'll stay here and register, you know.
Where's the house telephone?
- You may use this phone right here.
- Mrs. Michael Kent, please.
- Mrs. Michael- - Thank you, but what's the number?
Three fourteen.
- Why don't you rest for a while?
- I'm not tired. Just excited and happy.
But by tonight you'll be slaphappy. You're not used to this.
Take the advice of an old trouper.
While you can, go upstairs and catch forty winks.
I'll need 80 now.
Pardon me.
Mr. Kent. I didn't know that you were coming down here.
After that telephone conversation, where did you expect me to be?
I'm glad you did come down. I wanna explain the problem I'm facing.
All you need to explain is the meaning of this.
That just means that your wife has a wonderful voice.
My wife has a terrible voice and that's not all.
I didn't pay you to let her sing in a nightclub.
I was hired to shadow your wife. To stop her from singing would have been extra.
What about that man? That other man?
Well, I've almost finished a complete written report, Mr. Kent.
I don't want a written report,
I want my wife. Where is she?
Well, she's around somewhere.
Oh, she's around somewhere.
A fine detective you are.
No, I'm gonna do the decent thing. Your wife is in her room, Mr. Kent. Go to her.
- What?
- Maybe it was just being away from you.
Maybe she does really still love you. Maybe it was the tropical skies.
- Maybe it was just- - Tell me what you're raving about.
- I don't know.
- You what?
Well, I mean, it hurts too much to talk about it.
Go to her, Mr. Kent.
It's the best thing for everybody.
- Mrs. Michael Kent is not in her room.
- I saw Mrs. Kent step into the elevator.
- Oh, the elevator.
- Yes.
Where you going?
- Nowhere.
- Say, what's the matter with you?
- Mrs. Michael Kent's room, please.
- Is Mrs. Kent expecting you?
Well, what difference does that make? I'm Mr. Kent.
Room 314.
- Thank you. Come on.
- You're welcome.
- I said, come on.
- Good, good, good.
I was going off duty in 10 minutes, but I think I'll stay.
Michael, I think it's better you go alone.
I don't want to spoil your nice reunion.
- Going up, sir?
- Yes. All right, uncle.
Hello?
- Yes. - Darling,
I wanted to-
Oh, I beg your pardon.
I must be in the wrong room.
Really? If it was the right room, that's no way to open the door.
Yes, you're so right. I'm so sorry.
Would you like to play three-handed gin?
That's all I need.
Come in.
Say, you gave me the wrong room number. My wife isn't in 314.
I'm sorry, but she is, Mr. Kent.
But there's a strange girl up there. You'd better look it up again.
Three fourteen is correct, Mr. Kent.
Rio is getting more like Paris every day.
Don't be so excited.
Now let me get this straight. Mr. Kent is here?
That's right. Your husband.
- If we have a fourth, we can play bridge.
- I've got to think.
You have no time. You must leave immediately.
- What's the matter?
- Bec- Shut up, Oscar.
Michael, Michael. Come, come, come.
Me and my ambition to travel.
Darling.
Darling, it's me, Michael.
Who are you and what do you want?
- Isn't this Room 314?
- That it is.
Isn't this Mrs. Michael Kent's room?
Do I look like a Mrs. Michael Kent?
I must be dreaming, I... Well-
Wasn't there a woman in this bed five minutes ago?
- I'm no blabbermouth. Will you get out or-? - Excuse me, sorry.
It must have been that plane trip I took.
My goodness, it's getting so that a man isn't safe around here at Carnival time.
- Run along, run along.
- All right, I'm sorry.
It was my mistake. I didn't mean any trouble by it.
What are we gonna do now?
He's sure to find out.
Put on some decent clothes. I'll start packing.
That's right. I will help you, darling, come.
- Mr. Lazlo.
- I take off my glasses. Come, come, come.
What is the number of
Mrs. Kent's room, please?
Three fourteen. Who, may I ask, is calling?
Mrs. Michael Kent, and I'll be back.
What if there is bloodshed in 314?
We're going to do the whole third floor over anyhow.
I'm checking out.
- Is there something wrong, Mr. Virgil?
- Yeah, everything.
- Listen, Virgil.
- What's the matter?
I'm going crazy. I can't find my wife. She's disappeared.
She probably couldn't face you.
- For heaven's sake, what's this all about?
- I might as well tell you the truth.
I've fallen in love with your wife.
- What?
- She's fallen in love with me.
- What?
- The only thing I'm ashamed of...
...is it was on your time.
Virgil. Peter Virgil, you're fired.
Your bill, Mr. Virgil.
- Mrs. Kent.
- A fine job you've done for me.
So I'm going to sing tonight, am I?
Excuse me. It seems I'm caught between two bags.
Oh, and I see the way you've taken care of my reputation.
- Uncle Lazlo, you too?
- Yes, me too.
- Well, I am surprised.
- You are not surprised yet.
You will be surprised when I tell you that Michael is here too.
- What?
- Yes.
- Oh, what am I gonna do?
- I have a wonderful idea.
We will tell him that
- It's not good. No.
I just wanna find out who's in that bed now, that's all.
- Darling!
- Oh, so you finally made it?
Oh, Michael, I'm so glad you came.
It's been so lonely without you.
That's not the way I heard it. Oh, I know all about your little escapades.
This Peter Virgil you're in love with happens to be a private detective.
I hired him to shadow you.
Everything you've done has been reported to me.
- That's a lie.
- How do you do?
He is not a detective, and he hasn't met your wife.
You're back. You can't deny there's something between you and Virgil.
He confessed everything before he checked out.
Checked out? Oh, I gotta go.
Say, what has she got to do with this?
- Michael, if I- - Elvira, you'd better tell me. Tell me.
Michael, I can't-
Who are you? What are you doing here?
Don't you think we've been seeing too much of each other?
Elvira, what's the meaning of this?
Uncle. Why are you hiding in the closet?
I will
- I will tell you.
It's awful. There is such a hurly-burly in this Rio.
I was happy to find a quiet place.
Quiet place?
Well, you're not gonna sing and that's final.
Shout all you want to.
They paid to see Mrs. Kent, and that's who they'll see.
- Oh, no, they're not.
- But, Michael, it'll be fun.
Why, I sang for the Milk
Fund benefit, didn't I?
Yes, and for two years after that, everyone was drinking their coffee black.
But, Oscar, the contract is illegal. I said I was Elvira Kent.
You have Mrs. Kent's permission to use her name. They can ask her.
Please, let's forget it.
No, you've gotta do it for the sake of your country.
If Elvira ever gets out there to sing, she'll set the good-neighbor policy back 20 years.
I suppose if I'm lucky, they'll take me back at the Club Casa.
Five shows nightly at 40 a week.
I can go back to haunting the travel bureau, piling up literature on places I'll never see.
If I'm lucky, I'll meet a man who won't pretend...
...to be in love with me because it's his job.
Who are you to complain? If he's a phony that makes two of you.
You two should be very happy together.
He left thinking I was Elvira Kent.
I'll never know how he feels about Georgia Garrett.
Thank you.
Why, Mr. Virgil, I thought you went back to the States.
- I was going, but I didn't.
- I beg your pardon, sir.
- Can I help it if I can't help it?
- Yes, sir.
Waiter, table for Mr. Virgil.
And now, it is my great pleasure to introduce to you the star of our show.
The beautiful New York society lady who will charm you with her singing...
...Mrs. Elvira Kent.
Just a moment, please.
Ladies and gentlemen, I came here tonight with every intention of singing for you...
...but first I'd like you to hear from a very good friend.
She dreamt for years of visiting your beautiful country...
...and always wanted to sing in a glamorous place before a distinguished audience.
Will you give her that chance?
Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss Georgia Garrett.
You sigh, the song begins
You speak and I hear violins
It's magic
The stars desert the skies
And rush to nestle in your eyes
It's magic
Without a golden wand
Or mystic charms
Fantastic things begin
When I am in your arms
When we walk hand in hand
The world becomes a wonderland
It's magic
How else can I explain those rainbows
When there is no rain?
It's magic
Why do I tell myself
These things that happen
Are all really true?
When in my heart I know
The magic is my love
For you
Oh, it's magic.
It sure is.
A fine detective I turned out to be.
I didn't do so well as a married woman either.
You need practice.
SUBTITLES: LUÍS FILIPE BERNARDES
Tudo bem.
And what brings you to Rio?
I think I came here for the UNO.
- UNO?
- You know.
Não faça isso, menina, não faça isso, menina...
...que eu fico louco, fico louco.
Fico maluco.
Did you arrive on this ship?
I'll have you know I came here on my own private boat.
Yeah, on a tramp steamer.
Entendi tudo, entendi tudo.
Mas pequena bonita aqui é mato...
...aqui é mato.
And what do you do for your 'ganha pão'?
- For my what?
- For your living.
- Your living.
- I'm not leaving, I just got here.
No, no, senhorita não compreendeu.
- What do you do for your money?
- Oh, that's different.
Tell him, girls, I'm tired.
# Haven't you heard about Linda? #
# Linda's the star of the show #
# Well, follow me, sisters #
# While I tell him how my tootsies #
# Got these callouses and blisters #
# It's a long story #
# It's a long, long story #
# When I was just a tot of three #
# My mother used to scare #
# the living stuff out of me. #
# She'd say, Lindy, #
# Come up here and do your tapping #
# - Get up here, girl #
# - I said, tappin'... #
# Mama, what can happen from tappin'? #
# That's what I said to her #
# I told her just that #
# She said, you can get #
# Into a Broadway show #
# Meet a rich millionaire #
# With a load of dough #
# Well, I worked real hard #
# Until I reached my peak #
# Captain of the chorus at twenty a week #
# And then I met him #
# He was rich #
# He was wonderful #
# He was rich, he was marvelous #
# He was rich #
# I thrilled when I touched him #
# And then... and then he touched me #
# Not often #
# just a five here and a ten there #
# Yeah, he touched me all right #
# Now I got the bills to prove it #
# It's a long story #
# It's a long, long story #
# Linda, now that you're in Brazil #
# You'll find someone, you will #
# Most assuredly will #
# Who will fly with your heart #
# To a heaven so high #
# Till the world and its gold #
# Is a dot in the sky #
# Ai, ai, #
# Thank you, buddy, but I... #
# Came to Brazil to get back to New York #
# To retire on Park Avenue #
# Cause my mother is now 52 #
# And she wants to produce a review #
# She said to grab #
# A Brazilian with a million #
# In the casino, cafe or the beach #
# And if you can't find #
# A Brazilian with a million #
# Take two #
# With a half a million each #
# Save one for me #
How uh... how's it going, Frank?
- Great.
- Oh, great.
Great?
He says it's...
Well, of course it's great!
All right, take out your house and bring up your foots.
Now listen, kids, this is the opening show.
I want to get out there and sell this number...
...don't give it away.
Nice work, kids.
Steve! Steve!
Oh, you were swell, Linda.
You too, Tito.
Thank you, Steve.
Who said we couldn't get along without the great Vicki Dean?
Now, don't kid yourself.
We still need one of Vicki's numbers before we hit Broadway.
Why, Steve, darling,
I believe you're still biased.
Could be. Vicki's still tops in staging stock numbers, you know.
Is that your only interest?
Smart girls shouldn't ask needling questions.
Now go pour yourself into your next costume.
Don't forget the party in my dressing room between shows.
Yeah, I'll be there.
Life can be a funny thing,
Linda darling.
Yeah? I'm not getting hysterical over it.
You burn for him, he does not burn for you.
I burn for you, but you do not burn for me.
Sounds like a wet match.
Here. Go change your clothes and stop talking lie a lovesick pyromaniac.
Huh?
Senhorita Vicki Dean, New York City.
You are the one who is behind the scenes of Senhor Farraugh's Revue.
Was! Was!
Fortunately Senhor Farraugh's scenes are behind me now.
Senhor John Habour,
Pippinville, Iowa, U.S.A.
- Home of the clean tooth.
- Huh?
Oh, my company's product,
Pearly Dent toothpaste.
It contains the fenolinamide mercuro-bystolic oxilite
Huh?
No other manufacturer can make that statement.
I am very grateful, senhor.
I will keep it for a souvenir.
No, you don't keep it.
You use it.
Of course.
Thank you.
A long stay, senhorita?
No, just for the night.
We leave for the States in the morning.
Oh, where will I find Sr. Farraugh?
Backstage. Or in his suite.
202, down the corridor.
Thank you.
I won't be more than 10 minutes, dear.
- I hope.
- Even 10 minutes...
...is a long time to be away from you, precious.
What did you say, John?
Oh, I just said, even ten minutes...
I said even 10 minutes is a long time to be away from you, precious.
Don't be embarrassed, John,
I heard it.
I just wanted to hear it again.
Steve only called me precious when he forgot my name.
- He didn't want to spoil me.
- I'd like to spoil him.
You sure you don't want me to come along with you?
I could talk to him man-to-man.
- He isn't a man, he's my ex-husband.
- Well, even so...
Darling, this is woman's work, believe me.
All right, but if he gets rough remember...
I'm here.
As if I could ever forget it.
Will you keep still?
How do you expect me to get anywhere with you if you keep slipping away?
Sweetest picture I've seen since Whistler's Mother.
Oh, go away. I'm...
Well, well, well, hello, Vick.
Hello, Steve.
Still too big for your britches, I see.
You've got your 'Rs' mixed, this is Rio.
Thought you were in Reno.
That's been over for some time.
All set to go back to work.
No. My stop here is strictly personal business.
Here, give me that.
Why don't you use a crowbar and a rope?
Brass widowers can't be particular.
Now let's not feel sorry for ourselves.
Uh, would you mind if I sat down?
There's always a lamp burning in the window for you, dear.
Well, I jumped out of that window two months ago.
In case it slipped your memory.
That's where you made your greatest mistake.
But I'm glad you realized it and came back.
It's no mistake and I'm not back.
I just stopped off between planes for New York to get a good night's sleep.
Hm, seeing me in your dreams, eh?
Oh, no, Mama doesn't dream about you anymore, Steve.
You wouldn't know the old girl from Adam.
Oh, yes I would.
You stand next to Adam and I bet
I could pick you out 9 times out of 10.
You're repeating your act.
You used that the night you proposed.
I see you still remember it.
I remember everything.
That's why I divorced you.
- May I have one of those?
- Oh, sure.
- And a match.
- Hm, sure.
Thank you.
You know, Vicki, I sort of wished you hadn't done that.
- Done what?
- Divorced me.
It makes a fellow lose faith in himself.
Gives him a feeling he isn't wanted.
Look, junior, it may come as a surprise, but that's what divorces are for.
Oh, that's nonsense.
You got that old-fashioned idea that divorces last forever?
Till death do us part?
Today divorces don't mean a thing.
Just a few words mumbled over you by a judge.
We've got something between us that nothing can change.
Sure we have. I know that you're a stinker that'll never change.
I agree with you only because you undoubtedly got proof.
Your desk is just like your life.
Two telephones because you're two-faced.
Memos, bills, also powders, and for a paper weight there used to be a picture of me.
Wishful thinking. Very indicative.
You know I'm glad you threw it away?
All you did was knock it over reaching for the telephone.
I knocked it over for keeps the last time, Vicki.
Somebody drew a mustache on it.
Anyway, it didn't look the same after you left me.
Why did you promise not to tangle things...
...and then try to gum up the whole divorce?
Well, you know how it is, you don't miss the water till the well runs dry.
A goon your age hiring a plane to sky-write...
'Vicki, don't be hasty.
Remember my dimples. Steed.'
You must admit it was very original.
So original it tied up the whole proceedings...
...while the judge went out to look it over.
Vicki, I've still got that dimple...
...in the same place.
And I only did what any husband would do...
...who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
Home? What home?
What home? The home I promised you, don't you remember?
Oh, yes, of course.
The one we were going to have right after the honeymoon.
Three years ago!
Well, was it my fault that Oscar Ravel wanted a floor show in two weeks?
I don't know. All I know is that
I spent my honeymoon...
... in the smoking room of the El Lobo putting on dances.
- Vicki, the fact remains...
- Please, Steve, that's all washed up.
- Let's not fight that battle over again.
- Good!
I'll tell you what, Vicki.
You come back, go to work on the show.
If we find out we don't get along together, we can get married again.
- What?
- Sure! I haven't got any hard feelings.
Steve, you're really wonderful, in a loathsome sort of way.
Well the fact still remains.
You walked out on a show half produced.
You can't do that to these people.
You used to be a pretty good producer yourself, remember?
We were a good producer.
The two of us made one.
We worked together, we belong together,
Vicki...
- ...like caviar and champagne.
- Or like ham and eggs?
Well, we worked from those up to better things.
We made that climb together.
Oh, Vicki, I haven't got your touch!
- Will you please let me tell you...
- Honey, you don't have to apologize...
...for what you've done.
Just get in there and do your stuff.
Only this time don't spoil everything by marrying me.
Oh! I suppose I proposed to you!
Practically. I still claim
I'd been drinking that night.
Any gentleman would have forgotten all about it.
You... you!
Hello!
It's for you!
Hello... Oh, no, we're just sitting here talking over old times.
Yes...
Oh, hello, Louise.
No, no, Steve, this is Tito.
You know, Tito! La-la-la-la...
I go on in a few minutes with Veloz and Yolanda.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Louise, but...
Well, you get a dog show now and then.
Yeah, well those things happen, Louise.
Well, I was thinking of junking the whole number...
...and throwing in something else.
Walked out? Well, did you try giving away free dishes like I suggested?
They did?
Did they hit anybody?
Don't shout! Well there must be some way of getting them in.
Club them, if you have to!
We're not going to play the second show to an empty house. Goodbye!
Trouble, trouble, trouble, from every department.
Well, add one more from my department.
You know, Vick, you got back just in time.
I was just telling the kids in the cast...
Will you listen to me? All I want is your signature on this divorce service.
Unless my memory fails me,
I've already signed one of these.
Your memory didn't fail you, but your ink did.
- Huh?
- Quit acting.
You know you signed the original one with disappearing ink.
Did I?
This time my lawyer requested you use my pen.
It's filled with indelible ink.
Under the circumstances, are you divorced or am I still responsible?
Oh, I'm divorced, but I have to prove that you accepted service...
...or I can't remarry.
Honey, in that case you've nothing to worry about!
What do you mean nothing to worry about?
It just happens that I'm in love!
Don't fight it, Vicki.
It's bigger than both of us!
- Not with you, you conceited, irrespon...
- Temper, temper, temper.
Do you see this? People use them as a preface to marriage.
- It's an engagement ring.
- Engagement ring?
I tried to tell you but you wouldn't let me.
I'm getting married, Steve.
Putting the lid on your tempest teapot.
I have a one-way ticket out of this brawl...
...I used to call my career.
It isn't a vice, Vicki, that you can swear off.
It's a way of life. Your way.
Oh, you'll be like the old fire horse.
First puff of smoke you'll be back in harness.
Running the other way.
- You know what you want.
- Yes.
- You won't accept any substitutes.
- No.
Even if life has something better to offer.
Life has offered me a husband and I've accepted.
A real husband!
So you got a real husband.
I will have, as soon as we get back to the States.
We? You mean he's here with you?
Yes. I met him in Buenos Aires.
- Rich, I presume.
- A comfortable income.
- Hello, Steve.
- Oh, hello, Caroline.
- Hello, Alice.
- Hi!
Hello, Mrs. Farraugh, glad to see you back.
Thank you, Frank.
It's Miss Dean again.
- Big cattle rancher, huh?
- Toothpaste.
- Did you say toothpaste?
- I did.
You mean that soapy stuff...
...that gets all over your dressing gowns in the morning?
What's wrong with toothpaste?
It's a nice, clean business.
Oh, sure, it fairly takes my breath away.
I mean, it's got the flavor of romance and adventure about it.
Oh, I can see you and the children...
...filling those little tubes on cold wintery nights.
John happens to be vice-president of the Pearly Dent Company.
Oh, that's what I like to see.
A young man with both his feet firmly planted...
...on top of his desk.
- Will you...
- Shh! The Copacabana number's on.
This'll knock your eye out.
- If you don't knock it out first!
- Shh!
Veloz and Yolanda, Tito Guizar and a page from your notebook.
What a terrific combination!
- Two daiquiris, please.
- You are expecting someone?
- No.
- Alone at Copacabana? Impossible.
Not exactly. I'm stepping out with a memory tonight.
- A blond memory?
- A brunette memory.
Tell me. How did you meet her, senhor?
# I heard her voice beside me say #
# A daiquiri #
# I looked at her, said, 'If I may #
# The same for me #
# Copacabana #
# Copacabana #
# You and your Carnival air #
# So devil may care, #
# Encourage me #
# I offered her a wedding band #
# Right there and then #
# She said I want one on my hand #
# Never again #
# Copacabana #
# Copacabana #
# Dance for the fond memory #
# I find with every daiquiri #
# Copacabana #
They're lovely, aren't they?
Yeah, I'm planning to use them in the new finale.
Planning? You mean you haven't got one yet?
Oh, sure, sure. What's more, it was received with deafening silence.
But I'll think of something.
You know, I wish I...
Uh... hm.
That's true beauty.
Sheer poetry.
You look at that you realize why you're working.
- Let's go.
- It's like a poem.
I said let's go.
You know, I'm building a whole new finale around them.
Something allegoric.
Veloz will represent man, the unconquerable.
And Yolanda will represent woman, the... unconquerable.
You'll want them to come for you with a net?
The chorus will weave through it all...
...carrying Latin American flags, representing, of course, all the Latin American countries.
Oh, brother!
Oh, this is the finish.
I want you to catch it!
- Very good, Frank.
- All right, take your curtain calls.
Now do you see what I say about the finish?
I want to get something with more snap to it.
Like bubble gum?
No, I want to hit them with something big.
It's all right if they don't hit back in self-defense.
That's my point, Vicki.
You've got that infallible instinct.
Well, I mean, if anything's wrong, you know it, and with what we've got here...
Are you going to sign this or do I have to call out the marines?
Much applause.
I cannot take so many bows.
What's the matter with a lot of bows?
Because the blood rushes to my head.
- Oh, Vicki!
- Hello, Tito.
- Are you back for good?
- Good or bad, I'm leaving tomorrow.
I was just telling Steve yesterday.
If you could only be here for the opening.
The show is so wonderful.
- Oh..
- We want you to...
Save it!
Uh, we hoped you'd get back in time to save it.
- Well, what is there to save?
- Nothing, nothing.
We'll throw out everything if we have to.
- But the audience keeps...
- So quiet! So darn quiet.
Oh, listen, tell Linda to keep that opening number moving, will you?
- It died the first show.
- Died?
Oh, you noticed it too?
Oh, sure, Steve, sure.
Well, I'll see you later, Vicki.
Uh...
All right, all right,
I'll sign your paper!
I can be generous, even if you can't.
But before I sign myself away I want to meet your toothpaste impresario.
- What for?
- What for? So I can study him!
I want to model myself after him.
I want to compare my own shoddy personality... with that of this paragon of virtue!
- What's the matter, you afraid?
- No, of course not!
All right, then let's get at it.
At least when I'm with John he opens doors for me.
He treats me like a lady.
What do I treat you like, a water buffalo?
I don't know any water buffalos, but I do know John.
He's sweet and considerate.
He wants a home and children.
Sound like the guy I should marry.
Well, well, well, so this is the plucky little man who's going to make a brave new world for Vicki.
- No, no, he's...
- I can see my wife's raised her standard.
- You must be mistaken.
- Can't mistake the mark of sterling.
- Be good to her, John...
- Stop it, you fool!
She doesn't ask for much, a nod, a tender word, a gentle caress...
- Excuse me, but...
- We don't need any comics.
It's the little things that count with Vicki, things like undying love...
...and her destiny of petty annoyances.
Believe me, John, if I had to do it all over again I...
I...
Ai, ai, ai, what a thought.
- You can say that again.
- But... I'm John.
- Hm?
- John.
- Oh, over there.
If you ever need anything, fella, money, a friend, a word of advice, a new deal,
- You know where you can go.
- I'll buy that.
- I happen to be John Habour.
- You're John Habour?
- Yes.
- Well, who is... who are you?
I'm Sonny Kirkeby.
Well, see here, Sonny, is this matter any concern of yours?
No.
Well in the future I'll thank you to keep your nose out of my business.
There's a wise guy in every lobby.
I'm terribly sorry about this, Mr. Habour.
- Oh, that's quite all right.
- It's a natural mistake, John...
- You don't mind if I call you John?
- Not at all.
After all, we're practically related, aren't we?
In a way, I suppose that's true.
Of course Vicki led me to expect a much older man.
- Now, just what did I say that...
- It doesn't matter.
I realize you didn't mean older in years.
Tell me, John, do you always carry an umbrella?
Well, it looked a little dubious outside...
...and I thought we might do some sightseeing.
Atta boy, health comes first,
I always say.
Well, shall we go?
Where are we going?
We're going on the terrace, have supper and watch the show...
- Didn't Vicki tell you?
- Vicki did not...
...and we're doing nothing of the sort.
Oh, that's Vicki for you.
Changeable and unpredictable.
But you'll get used to it.
You want me to sign that paper in John's presence, don't you dear?
All right, have it your way, but it won't get you anywhere.
That's what you grow to love about Vicki.
She gives in after you beat her brains out.
Well, you seem to have a full house.
Why not, they're all friends,
Louise's and mine.
- Which one's yours?
- I'll let you know after the show, or I might lose him, too.
Reservation, senhor?
Oh, desculpe-me, Sr. Farraugh.
I feel a little embarrassed with so many people dressed.
Don't you give it a thought, John.
They'll just think you're some harmless drunk that wandered in.
# To buy you some bread roll #
# You need dinero #
# Mucho dinero #
# You can't live on besos #
# You gotta have pesos #
# Mucho dinero #
# A gay caballero with poco dinero #
# Doom gets the air-o #
# And if you should doubt it #
# Try doing without it #
# Mucho dinero #
Uh, have a seat, John.
- You got a waiter handy, Fernando?
- Um momento.
Well, what'll it be, Vicki, a rhum passion?
You used to go for those the big way when you were younger.
Well, I'm old enough to know better now.
Scotch and water, please.
I'll have the same.
Do you feel like a little passion, John?
- Don't mind if I do.
- That's two scotches and water and uh...
- ...a passion.
- Muito bem, senhor.
Well, well, well...
Two little love birds.
How does it feel, John?
It feels pretty good, Steve.
Pretty good!
Well, I felt the same way before I took the leap.
Shook me up a bit when I landed, though.
But you haven't got a thing to worry about, John, not a thing.
The first few years are the hardest and... I had those.
Oh, but you're getting a great little woman.
- Great!
- I think so.
Yes, she grows on you.
Like a tender vine.
You must be reading my mind.
You know, that's what makes her such a cracking-good showwoman.
A wonderful imagination.
Do you know she once imagined
I was the only guy in the world?
Somebody should have told me there were others.
I would have shopped around.
But I will admit that I never had anything before I married Vicki.
But I had to find that out after we were married.
Oh, now, Vicki!
Oh, you'll get used to that, John.
You see, she's allergic to her past.
She breaks out in rash statements.
But she's the life of the party.
- Always good for a laugh.
- Yes, and she sings too.
- Oh, you found that out?
- Naturally. She's told me everything.
Well, I think that's the best way.
I'm glad you know about the time we got drunk together...
...before we were married.
I don't think I recall.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry!
Me and my big mouth.
- Yes...
- Well, let's change the subject.
- Don't you dare!
- Well, I mean, I didn't realize...
Oh, I merely invited Vicki up to my apartment for a bite to eat...
...or something.
- Or what?
- Or nothing.
I was too busy working.
I'll say you were.
You were in the middle of an inspiration, broke in to the leading man, hotel room 3:00 in the morning.
- Oh well, I wasn't alone.
- Of course not!
You brought the whole orchestra with you to prove your point.
- Remember the fellow with the base drum...
- How would I forget that?
Oh, I'm sorry, John.
Show business.
You sure you won't miss all that too much, Vicki?
- No.
- Why, of course not, John,
You can give Vicki what she really wants.
Regular hours, luncheons, housework, plenty of fresh air...
- I can give her that, all right.
- I'll bet you can.
Uh, where did you say you were going to settle?
Pippinville.
That's funny, it sounded just like you said Pippinville.
I did. Pippinville, Iowa.
Population 10.000
We're only 30 miles from Des Moines.
Oh, well, it's nice to be near the center of things.
Pippinville was just a hamlet till Pearly Dent toothpaste came in there.
- Just a small cavity, eh?
- My mother has a lovely home there.
We're going to live with her.
Oh, isn't that swell?
A home with mother in Pippinville?
It's a mighty fine town.
We grow corn higher than your head.
- I'll bet.
- At least it's a new brand.
- Oi!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Perdão, senhorita.
- You owe me one.
Well, to the bride and groom.
No more numbers, no more routines, no more songs and rhythms to worry about.
- You wanna bet?
- Save your money.
You know, I could prove to you that you're kidding yourself...
...but why destroy your illusions?
- I'll take the chance.
- Okay, you asked for it.
If Madriguera's next number doesn't get you going,
...I'll sign your paper.
Give you my blessings, five dozen diapers, and promise faithfully to brush my teeth twice a day with Pearly Dent toothpaste.
It's a deal.
# To play the minute samba #
# takes a minute #
# A minute #
# Sixty seconds of Brazil are in it #
# Are in it #
# So maestro won't you kindly violin it #
# We will time this new tune #
# Do begin it #
# Come on get ready, get set #
# One, two, three #
# Go! #
# And if you play it in a minute #
# What a thrill is in it #
# The samba, samba, samba #
# The minute samba #
Don't forget, now, twice daily with Pearly Dent.
And, to start you off,
I'll give you the brush.
It's amazing.
All right, I'll sign.
- You sure you don't want my fingerprints?
- No, thanks, I've still got those.
Ah-hah! Not with disappearing ink, you don't!
- Give him your pen, John.
Delighted.
I give you emancipation.
Now I know how the slaves felt.
- Now I know how Lincoln felt.
- Before or after he was shot?
I'll take charge of that this time, if you don't mind.
I'm glad to see you assert yourself, John.
You have to do that with Vicki.
She practically made an introvert out of me.
Oh, 14 psychoanalysts and a Zulu witchdoctor couldn't do that.
Wouldn't a rivet job save wear and tear?
It's an idea of Mother's.
Father was always a little careless.
- I'd say reckless was a better word.
- Well, I say, better be safe than sorry.
Well, there we are, snug as a bug in a rug.
- And thank you very much.
- Don't mention it.
Just tell'em where you got her.
Well, let's make merry, shall we?
It's almost showtime.
Oh, frankly, I must apologize for the show...
...it hasn't worked out the way I wanted.
- What's wrong?
- Oh, Vicki'll tell us that...
...after she's seen the show.
I'm not saying and I'm not seeing.
Let's go, John.
Oh now, wait, Vicki. Cooperation's the life blood of enterprise.
Yes, I know.
Steve's had me anemic for years.
Isn't it amazing what a signature on a little piece of paper will do?
Vicki Dean is no longer responsible for Steve Farraugh's tough luck.
Oh, Vicki will want to help you, won't you, dear?
It's such a little thing.
A little thing?
Doctoring up a sick show?
Well, thanks for trying, John.
But you'll have to learn that when Vicki says no she means no.
And there isn't anything you can say about it.
Vicki will be glad to help you.
I'm sure she will.
I hope you don't regret this, John.
Regret it?
Since when do men regret looking at beautiful women...
...and listening to lovely music, eh, John?
Yes, sir!
Well, that's settled. I have to go backstage for a minute but...
I'll be back before the show's over.
Not a bad sort, Farraugh, when you get to know him.
Oh, yes indeed. He's capable of making some girl quite happy...
...slap happy.
Enric.
On the second chorus of Linda's number double the tempo.
You know, step it up?
Just this show.
Without a rehearsal?
It'll throw her higher than a kite.
Oh, she can handle it.
Go ahead, try it.
Come in.
Hi! Oh, I'm sorry
I couldn't make your party...
...but I had some business to take care of.
The way I heard it, you're back doing business the same old stand.
She couldn't stay away from Daddy, huh?
She just stopped off to return a couple of insults.
She's hot-footing it for matrimony again...
...and she's got her New-Deal candidate with her.
- Holy wedlock?
- Uh-huh.
And you're not going to throw a monkey wrench in the works?
Why should I try to stop her?
She's never reached the age of reason...
...and she's well passed the age of consent.
If she wants to fill my shoes with a squirt of toothpaste,
...well, that's her business.
I got my own worries.
Oh, yeah...
- About your number for this show.
- Yeah?
I want you to take that second chorus half tempo.
Half tempo? That's too slow...
It'll give you a chance to beat out the taps.
More oomph, more shmalz.
I've already told Madriguera.
Okay, Steve. You name it.
- I'll do it.
- Yeah... swell.
If this show is half as good as the dinner show, we're in.

You double-crossing skunk!
Smile to your public when you say that, dear.
Listen, baby,
I know what I'm doing.
So do I. Trying to make me look bad so Vicki'll stay and help.
You look good to me, darling.
A troupe of skunks like that couldn't make you look bad.
And if you ever get to Pippinville, just scamper through on all fours.
- Listen, Vicki...
- Goodbye, it's been jolly.
Sorry...
There goes a perfectly good idea...
- ...you kicked right in the face.
- Serves you right!
- You didn't care where you kicked me.
- I'm beginning to.
Your public, dear, your public.
Your uh... your name Irikie Bowers?
- That depends.
- On what?
Is your name trouble?
I'm Steve Farraugh,
I own the show inside.
Hey, you got a lot of good-looking tomatoes.
I got a lot of lettuce to go with it if you can give me a little information.
You can get that for a nickel in any telephone booth.
Uh-huh.
I'm looking for a smart guy to heist a wallet.
Wrong number.
I'm coming to the 2.000 cruzeiro question.
- That means $100 to you.
- Hold the phone!
I'm just the guy for you.
Used to work the subways in New York.
Got so good he could snatch a man's suspenders on Times Square...
...and his pants wouldn't fall down when he hit Brooklyn.
What did you do with all those suspenders?
That's my business.
- How's business?
- Oh, pretty good. I...
Where can we talk?
Step right into the office.
The girl's out to lunch.
Próximo avião da Panair.
Partida para Belém, e de lá, Miami.
Well, darling, we made it in spite of your dire forebodings.
I don't get it. Steve must be slipping.
You sure you got the tickets?
The tickets? Of course.
I felt sure he'd try and stop us...
...and curious about what method he'd use.
- My wallet! It's gone!
- End of curiosity.
- The tickets, the firm's money!
- And the signed divorce papers.
But it's impossible.
The safety pin's still fastened.
Did he brush up against you, or shake your hand, or pat you on the back or anything when he said goodbye?
No, no, it was very informal, he just said...
...'Good luck, old man, any wife of yours is a wife of mine.'
- Why do you ask?
- He had an actor once... who wanted to walk out on him,
Steve asked him for a light and then had him pinched for arson.
That's ridiculous, you may not like the man but he's not a pickpocket.
Let's don't talk about him if we can't laud him.
I had this safety pin after I left him...
All right, all right, take the luggage back to the taxi.
Show's over.
I'm terribly sorry.
Have you any idea where the wallet could be? Have you got a hunch?
Yes, and if you want me to call my shots, it's in Steve's pocket.
Will you please stop undressing that orange and listen to me?
- Pretty, isn't it?
- Everything we owned was in that wallet.
Including the divorce papers.
When you can't trust a safety pin what is the world coming to?
Think of the psychological effect on millions of babies.
Have a piece.
You must have been hatched out of an ice cube.
Opposites attract.
Aw, Vicki, I know how you feel.
It's a tough break.
- And you had nothing to do with it.
- Cross my heart!
That's the wrong side.
Well, I was going to say it's a cinch to replace the money and...
...I can wangle you a couple of airplane tickets, but the divorce papers...
- That's another thing.
- But that's the most important thing.
Yeah, you'll just have to call your lawyers in Reno...
...and have them mail you another form.
Oh, that'll hold us here four days at least.
Rough.
Maybe uh... you could do a little work just to while away the time.
What sort of work?
Oh, I'm not averse to assistance if it'll make you happy.
You're a born weasel!
You know, someday I'm going to resent these short, nasty biographies.
Well, if it's too short, I can double it.
Maybe John could bribe the airport and the telephone company with toothpaste.
All right, stop twisting my arm.
What's it worth to you?
I'll double your salary and kick in the airplane tickets.
What about the $5.000 that belongs to John's firm?
You might as well kiss that goodbye.
We'll skip the kisses and I'll take the goodbye.
Now wait a minute, wait a minute!
You talked me into it.
When do you start?
Right now.
I just wanted to make sure that you knew where that wallet was.
- Give me the police.
- Ask for the chief. His name's Castro.
- I meant to call him.
- I'll save you the trouble.
Tell him I enjoyed spending the day with him...
...and we must do it again sometime soon.
After my wife libels me with criminal accusations.
You mean you and...
Steve Farraugh, you are without a doubt the nastiest, cruelest, meanest, foulest, lowest, contemptible...
Hey, you cleaned it up!
Oh, what's the use?
You win!
I've got one foot in a bear trap and another on a banana peel.
Atta girl! You call Reno and charge it to me.
Limit your call to 3 minutes, please.
Come in!
Look, Tito, it won't cause you any trouble at all if you handle it right!
Tell Linda Vicki's staying over to help her...
...in spite of all that I did to get rid of her.
Why didn't you tell me he had a chain to him?
Tito, will you do as I tell you?
Take Linda out to lunch, buy her a bottle of wine.
On me! Sure the imported stuff from California. Hold it.
- Good work Irikie, here's your payoff.
- Nothing doing. That's American dough.
And I need some ready cash.
That's hot.
I ain't got enough on me to finance a bag of peanuts.
What is that, a bale of hay?
Oh, that.
Phony dough, strictly for laughs.
Made in Flatbush by a near-sighted amateur.
It's all screwy. The bald eagle's wearing Washington's wig...
...and George is laying an egg.
You can keep it, if you like.
Maybe you can keep it for stage money.
- On me it don't look good.
- Swell. I'll give you a check.
Cash it at the desk.
Hello, Tito.
Look, I'm not worried about Linda.
It's Vicki. I want to get her out of the rut and into the groove.
Uh-uh-uh, not with your pen.
Too bad you tipped that gag about the disappearing ink, boss.
Here. This'll make it stick.
Two thousand cruzeiros.
Look, Tito, she's got to work with Vicki!
Linda's not running the show!
No, Linda's not running anywhere.
Well, stick the two together and see what cooks!
All right, so it's goulash, that's better than nothing.
Thanks, senhor.
If you know anyone else wants to get took, just yell taxi.
Well... See you in the line-up.
See you around, Irikie.
Hello, Tito.
Of course I know what I'm doing.
I want Vicki where she belongs, back in the show.
Why?
Because I'm in love with her!
Oh, back so soon? I guess you're anxious to start working?
Yes, the sooner I start, the sooner I'm through.
Now, about that finale. I'd like to try something new and unconventional.
You don't say!
On our way here from Buenos Aires our plane stopped in a small town.
Fresh!
And John and I went to the market place.
And we saw the most fascinating native types.
It was wonderful.
Have you got a match?
You could see the same thing right here in Rio, you know.
They've got a guy... he carries chickens on his head.
- Yeah! Galinha! Galinha!
- It's terrific!
Tell me, do they have those coffee carriers?
You know, the ones who chant while they work?
Do they have?
Listen, you happen to...
Hundred pound sacks!
Padoom, padoom...
Wonderful! We'll weave the chant right into the music.
Sure!
Oh, and they've got street fighters!
This'll kill ya.
They fight with their feet!
- No!
- Yeah! They go...
That's amazing!
I've never seen that before!
Well, as long as you're so hot on the idea, why don't you go get a doll on paper, draw some sketches, it'll help you design the costumes.
That's right.
I forgot my purse.
Oh, yes, of course, here we are!
Why don't we take a tour tonight right after the show?
Just the two of us!
I used to be a very good escort, if you remember.
I'll take John. I'll be lucky if you escort me to the door.
Oh, of course, how silly of me.
Yes, well, I'll see you later?
Goodbye.
I've hired a car and driver, so we'll go to all the important avenidas, the praças... the Copacabana, the Urca, the Atlântica... we'll wind up at the Samba Lêlê, everything on me, of course.
You can deduct it from our wedding present.
I hope you don't mind if I take forty winks in the car,
I'm not used to these late hours.
Why, not at all, old man, you can sleep wherever you want.
You're in my hands.
It's like sleeping on the paws of a grizzly...
Oh, hi, you two. Want to come along?
We're off to see the town.
- No, thanks, I've been to town.
- I wish you would, Miss Lawrence.
Steve and Vicki are going to talk shop.
Maybe you and I could amuse each other.
That's the most one-sided offer
I've had all day.
- Oh, you're too modest, Miss Lawrence.
- No, thanks.
Well, if you change your mind, we'll be at the Samba Lêlê later.
Oh, fine, bring Tito,
We might as well turn this into a safari.
- A penny for your thoughts.
- Don't waste your money.
It's Steve again?
If that dame is leaving him, she sure is taking a long scenic route.
Linda, I wish I could help.
Would you like to buy me some supper?
Even second fiddles help in an orchestra.
Where's that hokey-pokey chiseler who runs this flea circus?
- Chiseler in a flea circus?
- You mean Steve Farraugh?
That's him, the two-time creep.
You sound as if you belong to my club.
What's he done to you?
Take a gander at that.
A check to nobody, for nothing, signed by no one.
Yeah, well, it was for 2.000 cruzeiros when the cheap magician gave it to me for heisting a poke.
Oh, I know a pig in a poke but I don't know a heist in a poke.
I left my scarf in the dressing room.
Would you be a darling and get it for me?
Sure, I will get it right away.
Now what's the story?
He wants to get some papers back to the giver guy.
So he comes to me, recommended, mind you.
How do you like that guy?
Oh, if there's one thing
I can't stand, it's a crook.
- This is the 'feira'
- Huh?
A marketplace, to you foreigners.
Cinco centavos bolinho.
Cinco centavos bolinho.
Cinco centavos bolinho.
Quer comprar?
Cinco centavos bolinho.
Cinco centavos bolinho.
Galinha!
Galinha!
Sorvete!
We set this native atmosphere to music, Steve, and it spells 'soco'.
You don't see this on a $2 tour.
It gives the authenticity we need.
Authenticity!
Now why didn't I think of that?
Because you don't know what it means.
Olha o Tito Guizar!
Oh, there's Tito.
He's alone.
- Alone?
- What are those, penguins?
Look at that guy Farraugh.
Ridin' high on my dough.
Senhores e senhoras.
O querido cantor mexicano Tito Guizar...
...vai cantar agora...
Do you think you can get the wallet back?
Lady, you don't know it but in about
2 minutes he's going through bankruptcy.
And we'll be the receivers.
Muito obrigado.
Em primeiro lugar...
...vou cantar em inglês para os meus amigos americanos.
I just said I am going to sing in English for my American friends.
And for one American friend in particular.
# You never say yes #

- I gotta talk to you in private.
- Oh, well you...
...picked a great spot.
It's about that check.
I just decided I'd rather have the cash.
- There's nothing wrong with that check.
- Sure, it's as good as new.
- Any bank in Rio will honor it.
- Honors yet.
Well, my account is in that bank near the hotel. Are you familiar with it?
Familiar with it?
I bet I could even find my way around that bank in the daytime.
Well now, if you don't mind, let's just forget the whole thing.
You're pretty good at drawing blanks.
Wait a minute! You're trying to hold me up for more dough.
Oh, is that bad manners?
Will a couple of extra sawbucks finish this discussion?
Money talks, boss.
Uh-uh, that dough talks too long a sentence.
Well... here you are Irikie, now... let's just drop out of each other's life, shall we?
- Oops!
- I got it, I got it...
Watch the shoving.
That's all right, we'll get it...
Well, so long, Irikie.
I'll be avoiding you.
Don't mention it, boss.
Pardon me.
# Yo digo que sí #
# Me dissen que no #
# Tengo que buscar una linda mujer #
# Que cepa querer #
# Que cepa besar #
Just a minute, Bud!
I beg your pardon.
Did you lose something?
# Yo digo que sí #
# Me dissen que no #
# Tengo que buscar una linda mujer #
Por favor, não façam isso!
Por favor, não façam isso!
Polícia! Polícia!
Polícia! Polícia!
Jesus, the cops!
- Here, here, here!
- Oh, you can't pin this on me!
Senta, senta!
See here, officer, this gentleman is a friend of mine.
Yeah, we were cub scouts together in Peppermintville!
Just a minute, officer, you can't do that!
- You can't incarcerate him...
- Just a minute!
May I join you?
Oh... John!
Washington will hear of this!
I have friends in Missouri!
Por favor, por favor, não...
Can't you induce Leo to stop pacing?
- They don't feed here till 7:30,
- He has a right to be nervous.
I most certainly have.
What if this gets back to Pearly Dent?
I can just see Mr. Frydecker's face.
- What... what can I say?
- There's only one thing you can say.
Help!
Oh, this is what I get for trusting humanity.
I got half a mind to spill it to Junior.
You've got half a mind but this isn't the time to strain it.
And where's our Mr. Farraugh?
Crawls out through a crack in the woodwork...
...and leaves us flat on our... habeas corpuses.
Well, he's arranging it with the chief to get us bailed, isn't he?
And seeing the American consul.
Well, don't plan on spending the day at the beach.
Steve wouldn't lend a helping hand if he had three of them.
Oh, I forgot to warn you.
He doesn't like to have his picture taken.
He's very sensitive about it.
What we do?
You push the button. I'll see that he's looking at the birdie.
What humiliation!
I won't stand for it!
Why don't you sit down, darling?
There's nothing you can do about it.
Sit down? How can I sit down?
It's easy.
Just take the end of this bunk.
A businessman like you should be able to make both ends meet.
A man in my position in this predicament!
You know, in a way I blame that...
What's that?
Good.. good grief!
I've been shot!
- We've all been shot!
- Relax, folks!
Little Stevie's busted this case wide open.
We're all as free as the swallows of Capistrano.
Someone out there just took a photograph of me.
It was more like a family group.
Phot... oh, John that's impossible.
They don't allow photographers in here.
- Must be your imagination.
- More likely your imagination, innocence.
If ever I saw a flashbulb that spelled idea, that was it.
All right, don't worry, every editor in town's my pal.
If there's a picture, I'll kill him.
- Are you positive, Steve?
- You're in my hand.
- Not entirely. Just his throat.
- Oh, poor little girl.
Up till 4 a.m. Well, we'll whisk you home, tuck you in beddy-bye...
... where you can get a good rest.
Because you start rehearsal at 7 a.m. sharp!
Well, small-timer, you gonna let him get away with this?
I don't like to start no fights in the jail.
Don't be so sentimental.
Come on!
I'm terribly sorry, John. This must have been a horrible experience for you.
- What about me?
- You've got work to do, dear.
Just a minute, wise guy.
What about that check with the phony ink?
It came back from the bank marked NSF.
- NSF?
- Not Sufficient Fluid.
- Do I smell something peculiar?
- So it's reaching you.
You should have seen the fade-away check this guy gave me.
You could cash it, maybe, with a pair of sneakers and a good wind behind you.
Check? What are you talking about?
Now don't give me a blank look too!
Maybe this chump here's got a better memory.
- Do you pay or do I sing?
- Please don't sing,
- I have a splitting headache.
- Oh, do sing.
You have such a pleasing voice.
Oh, this is no place to talk business, son.
If there's anything wrong with your salary check... you can come around to the hotel in the morning and I'll pay you cash.
I'll be there. Any more phony passes and I speak my piece.
- Come on, babe. I'll ride you home.
- So early? The party's just warming up.
The party's over, honey.
It's a little fellow I had in the show, he couldn't sing or speak his piece...
...so I had to discharge him.
You're a verbal Houdini but you can't talk yourself out of this one.
- Get in, John, we're leaving.
- Yes, of course. Come on, Steve.
Without Steve!
Now wait a minute, you're jumping to conclusions!
I've jumped my last time for you.
Let's get going, driver.
What about the show, the finale?
I mean, you gave me your word!
I just thought of a better word.
But you've got those sketches.
Rightfully, they belong to me.
Oh, if that's all that's worrying you, you can have the sketches.
Before you hire somebody to steal them.
Let's go driver!
But... you...
Have you a telegram for Mr. John Habour?
Ah, sim, Sr. Habour, immediately.
Good heavens!
Vicki, look at this!
- Oh, this is awful, terrible.
- You should have kept your mouth closed.
I don't mean the picture, what about the story?
Whatever it is, you're stuck with it.
Do you realize what a thing like this could do to me?
I can see...
Transamerican News Service...
You shouldn't have irritated Steve.
He said he could kill the story.
The only thing Steve could kill is man's humanity to man.
Your telegram, senhor.
And one for you, senhorita.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, listen to this!
"Horrified and shocked at nightclub scandal, stop"
"May lose us Buenos Aires contract, stop."
"Return there immediately, explain and secure affirmance..."
"...or consider your association with Pearly Dent at an end."
"F.F. Frydecker, the President."
Oh, how could this happen to me?
- Get a load of this.
- My career.
It's from my lawyer, some very interesting news.
- Everything I've worked for.
- Listen, this concerns us both.
I've got to get to Buenos Aires by the next plane.
All right, John.
I'll see that we get there.
But every cent I had was in that wallet.
How can we possibly get there?
We're already started and
Steve Farraugh is our first stop.
- Steve?
- Yes.
He's going to give us an all expense trip.
# Cinco centavos iô-iô #
Well, well, what a little paste can do.
# Cinco centavos, iô-iô #
Wait here. I've got to see a guy about a character who hasn't any.
Hiya, babe. Say, out of the can you look out of this world.
Thanks, you look pretty unearthly yourself.
Did you get the 30 pieces of silver from...
- He gave me half on account.
On account he couldn't help himself, no doubt.
- You still got that check?
- Sure.
Hang on to it and stick around outside.
- What's your promotion, sister?
- A little larceny. You'll love it.
All right, folks.
All swell, kids, take five.
We'll run it through again later.
I can just see you on your knees trying to put the pieces together.
Keep that picture, darling.
That's what I tried to do with our lives.
Aw, Vicki, I knew you wouldn't let me down.
You can skip the boyish enthusiasm.
I know all about the wallet routine.
Uh-oh, did you tell the Iowa Casanova?
- Not yet.
He'll only have you thrown in the clink and I don't want that.
- Loyalty, a priceless virtue.
- Priceless? Not on my adding machine.
Now, listen, Vicki, on the level.
I haven't got the wallet.
I lost it last night in that fight.
The police are looking for it now.
Oh, hi, John. I'm terribly sorry about all you've been through.
It's all my fault. I needed Vicki.
I needed her badly.
- To fix up the show I mean.
- Oh.
Have you seen the morning paper?
Just my luck. The one editor in town I couldn't fix.
Perhaps you'd like to see the result.
John, there's only one decent thing for me to do.
That's get you passage on the next plane to Buenos Aires...
...and I'll dig up enough cash to get you there...
...and tide you over till your wallet shows up.
Enough cash for us both to get there.
I'm going with John, you know.
Oh... oh, of course.
I suppose it's worth the risk.
- Risk?
- Well, uh... on top of the scandal and all you two traipsing off to Buenos Aires... nothing shabby implied, you understand, but to narrow-minded people... what with the divorce shaky already...
- It hadn't occurred to me in that light.
- Don't listen to him, John!
Don't you know by now how his warped mind works?
Oh, you...
You can pull out your fangs, you've injected your poison.
Well, if you must humiliate me this way...
I haven't enough cash available for the both of you...
You can't use this.
- What's wrong with that?
- What's wrong with it?
Why, nothing's wrong with it.
It's uh...
It's payroll money.
Grab it, John!
It's the only way you'll get it.
Now count it.
Wait a minute!
This is highway robbery.
I mean, there are courts of law, you know.
- How am I going to pay the cast?
- Borrow it.
- I did. That's it!
- Four thousand five hundred.
- You are sick! Twenty-five hundred.
- Money, money, money. You American.
We haven't much time to catch that plane.
Did I detect a note of gaiety?
Fatalism, my dear. After all, if John's wallet shows up, it'll be a happy ending to this sort of incident.
- You've got wind of that wallet!
- Not at all.
Come on, Vicki, we've got to pack.
Have the maid pack for me, dear.
I'm going to sit right here on a hunch.
Pull up a hunch and sit down.
Vicki, are you sure we both ought to go together?
After all, if he looks at it that way, other people... might...
I'll pick you up here.
All right!
Music! Go!
Keep in time.
- Perdão, senhor, where will I find...
- Over there.
Left! Left! Left!
Oh, that's fine.
- Perdão, senhora. Last night I was...
- Shh! Later.
May I... may I sit...
- Shh!
Galinha!
Galinha!
Now, when I say go, turn and start the other way.
- Go!
- Oh, no!
Oh, yes.
And... one, two.
One, two.
Now, you hold that for two beats and then you say...
We hope you liked the show.
- Stop it!
- All right.
Stop it, Steve.
This is ridiculous.
If you're going in for comedy, why don't you hire a comedian?
I don't have to.
Apparently I married one.
You're taking my perfectly good idea right into the ash can.
If you don't mind, I'm running things around here.
Better save your breath. You may have to do some running later.
My dear young lady, in case you've forgotten, this is Steve Farraugh.
What ever became of you?
Oh, yeah? Well I was in big time when you were still skipping rope.
I should have saved that rope.
My first mistake was in calling this a Vicki Dean production.
Your second mistake is not listening to my advice.
I don't intend to have my reputation pushed around.
If we ever hit Pippinville,
I'll have your name taken off.
Oh, don't be so superior. All I'm trying to do is give you a suggestion.
All right, don't give it to me, give it to them.
All right!
Come on downstage, everybody.
I want to talk to you.
Now, let's go back to the place where the ice cream man enters.
Perdão, senhor. Last night
I was minding my own business...
Very commendable.
You keep up the good work.
Thank you, You know,
I was listening to the music...
Well, well, well, this is a small world.
You're a very honest man.
I am! Are you?
This belongs to John Habour.
Yes, that's me.
John 'Pearly Dent' Habour.
And what's more, I'm gonna give you a large reward.
- Is there anything else you want?
- Yes... identification.
- You don't trust me.
- Yes... I trust you.
- But I ask that young lady.
- Now, just a minute!
- You interest me.
- I do?
Yes, for the show. You're so typically South-American.
But I'm a native of Austria.
My name is Ludwig Kriegspiel.
Well look, Joe, I've taken a fancy to you. I like you.
- I like you too.
- Oh, that's fine.
- Now give me the wallet.
- Oh, I don't like you that much.
Look, Ludwig, what's your profession?
Well, I used to be a time wast... a wine taster.
But now it's sort of a hobby.
How would you like to make
1.000 cruzeiros?
Oh, I couldn't afford that.
What, me?
It just so happens that I need a personal wine taster.
How would you like to taste wine for me?
- Good wine?
- Yes.
- Sherry?
- Yes.
- Madeira?
- Yes.
I don't like madeira.
I'll give it up!
Then that's settled, hm?
Ya... but what about my wife?
- Have you got a wife?
- Have I got a wife, ha.
Twenty years ago I came here as a tourist to see the sights.
She was one of the sights I saw.
Look, Ludwig, let's get to the point.
Doesn't your wife want you to work?
Oh, she encourages me to be a wine taster.
In fact, she drove me to it.
Now look, keep your wallet in your pocket and your mouth shut.
You're working for me now.
- But what will I do about John Habour?
- Shh!
Forget it! Is he thinking about you?
- I don't know.
- There you are. There's reciprocity.
- Is that so?
- By the way,
I want you to taste my cigar.
Have a smoke.
Have you got a match?
There, there.
Vicki! Vicki, I've decided.
You shouldn't go with me.
- You've decided?
- Yes, we've got to think of my job.
After all, you know, there's a lot in what Steve said.
Starting another scandal might be dangerous, you know.
You mean you want me to stay here while you go to Buenos Aires
- In this place?
- Only until the wallet shows up and...
...you have the proper divorce papers.
Yes, I understand, John.
I've been very nearsighted.
Well, impulsive, shall we say.
Well, I'll write you every day.
And remember, I...
Get a lot of rest, dear.
That's good.
Say, what is this?
Aren't you going with John?
No, I'm staying.
I'm going to wait for the wallet.
That's much better.
You mean John's going alone to the airport to buy his ticket?
He's old enough to buy his own ticket.
Now go away. Don't bother me!
Yes, but I...
Hold the music.
Okay, boys and girls, take five.
Oh, Frank, how are the sets coming along?
We're working on them, but did you say all...
Yes, all black. So that nothing can be seen.
- Use black throughout.
- What about the other...
The girls will come onstage through doors.
So the doors must be mechanically perfect because they must open and close...
- What are you going to do...
- The lighting will be from a spotlight...
...directly on the performers. So I'd like the electricians at all the rehearsals.
Gosh, it's swell to have you back with us, Miss Dean.
Thanks. But it's just for a one-night stand.
I'll be leaving as soon as a certain wallet shows up.
- What?
- Oh, you heard me!
You've got to catch him at the airport ticket office.
- Catch Mr. Habour.
- That's right.
He'll give you a roll of bills.
I'll tell you what to say.
I know what to say.
Thank you, Mr. Habour.
Wait a second. You don't even know the reason you're going.
He's going to give me money.
Who am I to look for another reason?
Wait a minute,
I'll tell you... Here!
- Now give him that wallet.
- Yes.
And this note...
...he'll give you a roll of bills and you bring them right back to me.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, yes.
- Okay now, get going.
- Where shall I go?
Oh, to the airport, I know...
Enric... in the new setup for the finale could you give me a...
...an effect that would sound like the rhythm of the coffee carriers?
I think so. Let me try.
- Mr. Farraugh, I'm here.
- Shh!
- I wish to make my report.
- Shh! Can't you see what's going on?
No, I can't see a thing.
- What happened?
- Some days if anything goes right, it's a miracle.
- You didn't catch John Habour?
- You won't believe this.
There's only one airport in the city.
And that is the airport
I couldn't find.
- You missed him entirely?
- To put it another way, yes.
He had already departed for Buenos Aires.
Oh, well he got off anyway.
That's something.
- Give me the wallet.
- I was just thinking...
Stop thinking on my time!
Give!
- This job, is it steady?
- Is it steady? Do you see these girls?
They've all been working for me for over 40 years.
- Over forty years?
- Hello, Steve. Hiya, Grandpa.
Grandpa? At her age, she's one to talk.
I don't know about this job.
Now, wait a minute, I haven't time to argue, I've got a finale going on.
Now you stay here until I get back.
Here, hold this cigar for me.
Oh, pardon me.
What are you, a Peeping Tom?
Oh, to that I can only say
I'm flattered.
What are you doing outside my door?
Well, it's a combination of fortunate events.
- You see, it all started with a wallet.
- A wallet?
Yes, I'd be very happy to tell you all about it.
- Don't tell me, just show me.
- All right, I...
Would you please hold this.
Thank you very much.
You see, the night was beautiful.
- The evening was young...
- You mean you found that.
- It found me.
- Do you know who that wallet belongs to?
To Mr. John Habour.
But Mr. Farraugh says...
He says that to everybody.
Forget that.
I'm Mrs. John Habour.
Hand it over, please.
Have you something on you to prove your identity?
In this costume, are you kidding?
Well, I don't know...
Look, if you're doubtful, I'll describe to you what's in the wallet.
- Can you?
- Well, yes!
- All right.
- $7.000 from Uncle Sam's mint.
Two airplane tickets to New York.
And a signed divorce service from Reno, Nevada.
And, and... three bicarbonate of soda tablets.
No, five. I know John's wallet.
Three. You don't know my stomach.
Here.
- Oh, thank you, thank you...
- Thanks a lot!
Hey...
Oh, all right.
I forgot to take off the cellophane.
Silly!
Ha-ha-ha.
Better get onstage, Linda.
- I've been thinking...
- I told you not to move!
You're working for me!
I have the feeling my job is done.
I've delivered the wallet.
- Delivered it?
- Yes. To Mrs. John Habour.
- That one?
- No. That one.
- You chowder head!
- Oh, don't bother to fire me. Here.
I bought my own cigar.
I'm going into business for myself.
All right, smart girl, where is it?
- In storage.
- Cough it up.
What makes you think you can sign for it?
- John's in Buenos Aires.
- That makes Vicki next to kin.
Okay, join the crowd, knife me!
I guess I've been kidding myself, Steve.
She's still on your wavelength, isn't she?
That's beside the point.
If you send that girl to Pippinville, you'll have it in your conscience for the rest of your life.
My conscience is rugged.
Now you test yours for a while.
Now wait, Linda, wait..
Linda, wait!
# Venha, venha, venha, moreninha #
# - Sai, vai pra lá, seu Nicolau #
# You are leaving Brazil #
# That's cause for regret #

- Curtain.
- Curtain.
There'll be no curtain bows.
Steve's too exhausted.
- Look, Linda, listen!
- You were thrilling. A star is born.
There's gonna be a dead star here unless she kicks in with that wallet!
Come on, give it to me!
- Congratulations...
- Thank you...
You were best. You'd steal anything, even your own finale.
Well, the doors were stuck...
I mean, the stage was...
Well, I didn't want the roof to fall down on our heads.
Look, Vicki, are you still soft on this character?
I... You know I'm marrying John.
When you get the signed divorce papers and the wallet back.
Naturally!
What would you do if uh... they showed up?
Why... I'd catch the next plane for Buenos Aires, of course.
Well, looks as if we both have lost something.
Thanks for the gesture, Linda, but give Vicki the wallet.
The wa...
Okay, Steve.
Get out of this one, if you can.
- Everything there?
- Yes.
Well, there's a plane leaving for Buenos Aires in 40 minutes.
- You can just make it.
- Oh, but the show isn't right yet.
It needs a lot of polishing before it hits Broadway. I've got a lot to do...
Don't you worry your little head about that.
You pack your dugs and hurry off to John. He loves you, Vicki.
I know, but he'll be busy.
I've got a couple of ideas and...
No, no, no, you're out of it.
Now stay out of it.
You rate a home and a family...
...and all those little things
I could never give you.
And John will make you happy.
He's a nice reliable guy.
- But Steve, I...
- I know I gave you a lot of headaches...
...but that's all over now.
Goodbye, kid, thanks for everything and think of me now and then, huh?
Miss Dean, long-distance call from São Paulo.
- São Paulo?
- São Paulo is the capital...
...of the State of São Paulo, Brazil.
I know, but who could be calling...
Hello?
John?
Yes, John.
The police were waiting for me at the airport when I got off the plane here.
The money I used to buy my ticket in Rio was...
...counterfeit.
Oh, you poor darling!
Yes, I think I know exactly how it happened.
I've got your...
...wallet, John.
Oh, yes, right away, uh...
Well, of course we can get it straightened out and...
...we'll see that you get back to Pippinville.
No, wait a minute, Vicki, don't do that, honey...
You never cried before.
Listen, Vicki, I'll get the ambassador to spring John.
I'll even get him to put the fix on toothpaste business as well.
Oh, Steve...
I thought you really meant it when you let us take that money.
- I thought you wanted to get rid of me.
- I never was a chump, honey.
I thought you didn't love me anymore.
How could I help but love a girl like you?
A model of all the virtues. Square, aboveboard, sincere,
- Hey, babe.
- Uh, not now, Irikie, later.
Oh, excuse me, I just didn't want to take no chance on muffin' this.
I thought you might show me how.
I haven't got time to sample your gin fizz now, Irikie...
- Some other time.
- Oh, sure.
Gin fizz? She told me to dip this in lemon juice.
- All right, Irikie, I'll drink it now.
- Dip what in lemon juice?
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
Dip this in lemon juice, eh?
Hm! I didn't know a lemon could do this.
No offense, dear.
Ah-ha!
- Some cocktail.
- You didn't finish your drink, dear.
I'll dry it off for you. They got some nice new blotters at the bank.
Don't you know it's illegal to collect twice for the same job?
Oh, is that so?
Gee, I must be an awful heel.
Well, anytime you need a heel, look me up.
- Hey, hey, hey!
- I've got to send this money to John...
- He's in jail.
- Who told you about that lemon juice gag?
Oh, didn't you know?
I got a wire.
My lawyer. He restored the original signature on the divorce paper.
Good show tonight, wasn't it?
You got that wire before John left, didn't you?
I did... I mean, I don't know, I...
Steve, don't look at me that way.
And you could have left with John, couldn't you?
I had to find out two things,
I found one didn't matter...
- ...and the other one was...
- Come here...
Steve, we may be married but there are some things you can't do...
And some things you can do.
SUBTITLES: LUÍS FILIPE BERNARDES
How's your love life?
Well, thank your lucky stars
Yes, thank your lucky stars
It's doing fine
Keep your love life
As sweet as candy bars
And thank your lucky stars
Like I thank mine
Everybody's living on less and less
But you're okay
You're such a big success, oh, yes
You've got your love life
And that's the only thing
They won't be rationing
They don't know how
So thank your lucky stars
Right now
Thank your lucky stars right now
Such a talent.
We must get her for the benefit.
Positively.
- Lovely, Dinah, lovely.
- Thank you.
Have you met our guest for tonight?
- Oh, John Garfield?
- Yes.
- Oh, certainly. I've known Johnny for years.
- You have?
Uh-huh.
- Confidentially, I'm just a little bit worried.
- You are?
I've seen him in all those pictures, but tell me, is he really that tough?
Tough? Oh, Don Wilson...
...John Garfield is the sweetest, mildest, gentlest boy...
...you'd ever wanna meet in the whole world.
Really?
Sure.
I'm warning you, Cantor.
Stop telling me what to do.
If we get out there and you cross me up,
I'm gonna flatten you.
I don't say that your way is wrong, only if you'd stand on the right side of the mike...
- I'll stand where I stood.
- You'll be hiding my face.
Is that bad?
Now look, this is only a radio show.
You read your lines. I'll read mine.
- Don't fool around with that microphone.
- Fool around? Me? Cantor?
I never interfere with anything.
With me, it's strictly live and let live.
Now, get ready, John, because we go right on. You know what I mean?
And here comes Eddie Cantor with his guest star...
...that bad boy of Burbank,
John Garfield.
Well, what are you gonna do for the folks, John?
Nothing. I ain't talking, see?
Not till I get paid.
Let's not argue over money.
How much you want?
- Five thousand bucks.
- Let's argue.
Garfield, I'll admit you're a great dramatic actor.
In radio, you're helpless.
You can't tell jokes, don't sing.
Sing? Now, wouldn't that be cute?
Garfield singing a song.
Why, I could just picture it. I'm in the death house. Waiting for the hot seat.
The reporters want the story of my life.
I ain't got time. I tell them:
It all began way back when...
My mama done told me
When I was in knee pants
My mama done told me, John
I'll never forget the day my mama done told me.
Picked me up on her lap, stroked my golden curls.
I was just 19 at the time and she said:
A woman's a two-face
A worrisome thing
Who'll leave you to sing
The blues in the night
Now the rain's a-fallin'
Now the train's a-callin'
A- hooey, da-hooey
It's a lot of hooey. I heard a train whistle, see? So I blew town.
I met the rat that started me on the road to crime.
Fish-eye Looey. I wanted to kill him.
I grabbed him by the throat.
I squeezed and squeezed.
I wanted to pay him for making me an outlaw.
- Shunned by society. A stinker.
- John.
- Let go of me.
- But he got away.
From Natchez to Sing Sing
From Memphis to Alcatraz
Wherever the rock piles grow
Ha-ha.
I've been in the best jails
Why, sure, I've seen me the best frails
And just like my mama done told me,
I met a two-faced woman.
Two-Kisser Bessie was her name.
They was handy, those two faces.
She could crack a safe and look out for the cops at the same time.
She was nuts about me till she fell for another guy, Fish-eye Looey.
I wanted to knock him off, see?
I went to his hideout.
I broke down the door.
He wasn't there. I waited. I nabbed him.
- I squeezed and squeezed.
- John.
I squeezed harder and harder.
Suddenly, I hear the sirens: Whoo!
The bulls. Somebody's tipped them off.
Somebody squealed to the cops.
My mama done told them.
My old lady, a stool pigeon.
I'm trapped. Trapped like a rat.
They're coming in on me.
They're getting closer, closer:
Oh, they got me.
Oh, Mama.
Mama, I gotta talk fast now.
You was right.
I've been in some big towns.
I heard me some big talk.
But there's one thing I know.
I can't die till I get even with Fish-eye.
Fish-eye.
A woman's a two-face
A worrisome thing
Who'll leave you to sing
The blues in the night
Good. Good. Good.
Thank you, John Garfield.
Thank you very much and good night, John.
If you please, Cookie Fairchild.
Potatoes are cheaper
Tomatoes are cheaper
Now's the time to fall in love
Why, the butcher, the baker
The candlestick maker
Gave the price a downward shove...
Here we are. Step right in the bus, folks.
We're leaving in a minute for a glimpse...
...at the homes of Hollywood's biggest movie stars.
It's the biggest 50-cent value in Hollywood.
Don't miss this opportunity.
You can tell the folks...
...you saw Bette Davis picking flowers in her own backyard.
There's a million thrills in Beverly Hills.
Take a glamorous trip through the Sunset Strip.
Come on, driver. It's 25 after 5.
Just let me get two more suckers, will you?
I mean, customers. Just two more.
No waiting. No delay.
We leave in exactly...
Hey, Pete.
Will you please give me a break?
It's tough without trying to out-shout that guy.
Okay. Okay.
- Hi, Pete.
How are you, Mr. Butler?
- Got a Sporting News?
- Yes.
- How's it, Pete?
- Haven't seen you in quite a while.
Olivia de Havilland, Alan Hale.
Step right this way...
- Are you going to the fights, Mark?
- Hello.
Oh, hello, Joe.
What's that for?
Have you given up acting?
No, but, well, a fella's gotta make a living between pictures.
- Oh, I see.
- Say, you're directing a picture over...
...at Warner Bros.
- That's right, Joe.
You think there might be something there that I can play?
Here's the man to ask, Joe.
This is my producer, Mark Hellinger.
- Joe Simpson.
- Hello, Joe.
Mr. Hellinger, you really ought to use me,
Mr. Hellinger.
- I've been reading your stories for years.
- Well, that makes two of us.
I'll tell you what you do.
Give me a ring at the studio.
Would 6:00 be too early?
I don't get in till 9.
I'll hold the wire.
- See you later, Joe.
- So long, Joe.
That's a funny guy. Clean him up and he's a ringer for Eddie Cantor.
That's his trouble, Mark.
I had him play a small part in a dramatic scene...
...and the audience died laughing.
I had to shoot the thing over without him.
That's why nobody wants to use him.
Pretty rough deal. Guy can't get a break because he looks too much like a star.
Yeah. That's a new way of becoming a failure.
- Hi, Pete.
Hi, Tommy.
- The Cantor show?
- Yeah.
- What time is it?
- Oh, about 5:27.
- What's all the excitement about?
- Something big, Pete. Big.
And when Tommy Randolph says big, it's big.
Say, this is too much.
Hey, what's the idea, Joe?
Tommy, I thought you were a pal of mine.
I can't stand that popeyed baboon.
Why don't you relax?
Aren't you imposing a little?
Don't be impatient, folks.
How about it? Show the little lady all the homes of the movie stars.
I'm sorry. I got an hour.
I gotta get back to my ship.
What better way can you spend your last hour than a bus ride?
Are you kidding?
Listen, we've been here for two hours.
When are you going to...?
I hope you'll be listening again next Wednesday.
Until then, ladies and gentlemen...
...this is Eddie Cantor saying good night, everybody.
Come on, Dinah, John.
John.
I can think only of that Dinah Shore.
We must get her for the benefit.
When I am conducting her with my orchestra...
...oh, boy, oh, boy, what effects I will get.
Orchestra and pia... No, no, no.
- We will talk to her.
- Here.
- To Dinah Shore?
- Yes.
- Are you crazy?
- Why?
That's not the way to get Dinah.
If you wanna get Dinah...
...you don't talk to Dinah Shore.
If I want Dinah Shore,
I don't talk to Dinah?
No, no, no.
You talk to Eddie Cantor.
He's got her under exclusive contract.
That is we should talk to Eddie Cantor, but we won't.
- Break it. You're double-park...
- Leave.
We should talk to Cantor but we won't?
No, because if we talk to Cantor now, he'll want to be in the benefit.
- Oh, that's bad?
- We don't want him in the benefit.
We do want Dinah Shore.
However, if we talk to Cantor at the right time...
...we may be able to get
Dinah without Cantor.
- Do you understand?
- No.
- Pardon me.
- A fresh guy.
What's the matter with these?
There you are.
Let's have a little system here.
I know you want everybody's autograph, so go from one star to another.
This way, please.
Oh, come on.
- Here you are, young man.
- Can we go home now, Uncle Eddie?
Yeah. Shh. Quiet.
Mr. Cantor, I feel you're one of the greatest artists in the world today.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.
- I'd feel complimented...
...if you'd honor me with your autograph.
- Yeah. Have you got a pen?
I'll be very happy indeed.
- It's for a little boy.
- That's all right.
Anything else I can do for you?
No, thanks. You've done enough already.
It's a pleasure, sir. Come in again.
Don't waste it, Tommy.
That all belongs to Eddie Cantor now.
- You got it.
- Got it?
Listen, when Barney Jackson tells you he'll get you a contract, you get a contract.
Yippee! Oh-ho!
Careful. Careful. Careful.
That ink's still wet.
Barney, you're a great agent.
How much do I get?
- A hundred bucks a week.
- Hundred bucks?
Thanks, anyway, pal.
I guess that's all right for a start.
And my commission?
Sixty bucks in advance.
Oh, sure. Just wait till he hears me sing.
He'll tear up that contract, give me twice the salary.
- He doesn't know what you're giving him.
- But he'll find out.
There's 60 bucks, right?
And there's your contract and good luck, kid.
Thanks. When does he wanna see me?
Oh. You're supposed to report to Cantor's house tomorrow.
- He's expecting you at 11:00.
- Okay.
No matter how big a star I get to be,
I'll never forget you for this.
- I know you won't.
- So long, Barney.
So long, kid.
Mr. Jackson. Mr. Jackson.
Oh, wait a minute.
Mr. Jackson.
Mr. Jackson.
- Well, hello there, Pat.
- Hello.
I was upstairs in your office and the furniture's gone, even the chairs.
What's going on around here?
I'm moving into a new suite of offices.
A gorgeous place, carpets, the chairs that thick.
- I see. Well, what about "Moondust"?
- "Moondust"? "Moondust. "
Yes, that's my song, remember?
You guaranteed to get it published in two weeks a month ago.
I bet you thought I forgot all about it.
Look, those things take a little time, arrangements, copyrights.
I think I do.
- Give me back my $50, Mr. Jackson.
- Leave everything to me.
- Barney never let a client down.
- Listen here.
I might be from a small town, but I was not the village idiot. I want my $50.
I'll give you a tip.
Show biz is all new to you.
- You're still green, a novice.
- Maybe.
You've got a lot to learn, gotta have grace, poise, self-assurance.
- What's that to do with it?
- When you sell a song...
...don't let them know you're an amateur.
You gotta be professional, aggressive.
Be egotistical, understand?
- Well, sure but...
- There's $50 worth of advice.
And now we're even. So long, kid.
So long, Mr. Jackson.
Even?
Union Depot, buddy.
Wait, you big...
Hey, stop that man.
Follow that cab.
Yes, ma'am.
Hurry up, please.
Wait a minute. What am I doing?
This isn't a taxi.
Oh, heck.
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.
If there's anything I can do to help...
- Come on. Let's get going.
- We want our money back.
What are you doing?
You've been stalling for over two hours.
Come on. Get going, will you?
We're passing the homes of some of our greatest stars.
On the left, you'll see the residence of Walter Houston.
What kind of a song was that you said you wrote?
- It was a beautiful, sentimental ballad.
- That'll be refreshing.
All you hear is
"Scrub Me, Mama, With a Salad Fork. "
Or "Beat Me, Baby,
With a Boiled Potato. "
Song or no song, what you ought to do is go home.
Oh, I couldn't go back to Elk Falls even if I wanted to.
- I haven't got the money.
- Oh, don't worry. I'll help you.
I have plenty of friends.
We all live together.
Hedy Lamarr, Lana Turner, Betty Grable, all have homes over there on the left.
- Most of my friends live in Gower Gulch.
- Gower Gulch?
Yeah, all picture people.
Nothing very fancy but they're a great bunch.
I can't understand it.
Nobody even wants to hear my song.
Oh, this is a tough town.
Look at me, driving a bus so I can eat.
Me, a fine dramatic actor.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, on your right the home of Stewart T. Hollingshead.
- Who?
- Stewart T. Hollingshead.
The great Vitagraph tragedian. You must remember him in Death Before Dishonor?
Never heard of him.
Never heard of him? His greatest role:
The famous deathbed scene.
His family clustered around his bed.
Oh, I can see him now.
There he lies, droning with pain.
He raises himself up on one elbow and says:
"I want you to promise me one thing and one thing alone.
My son, before I die...
Before I die... "
Hey, Mama, ain't he funny?
He looks just like Eddie Cantor.
Oh, Mama, he pushed me, Mama.
That's great, Spike.
Now give us "Otchi Chornia. "
Uh!
Uh!
Phew.
Uh! Uh!
Hey.
Hey.
Baa, baa.
Spike, you're a cinch.
I'm gonna see to it personally you boys get a radio spot.
Here comes Whirlaway on the outside.
Come on over, Joe.
- Are you sure they won't mind?
- I'm positive.
This is one place you can stay as long as you like.
- Oh, swell.
- Come on, now.
Joe, Joe, great news. I got it.
I finally got it.
You got it. He got it. You got what?
My radio deal. A hundred a week, option's for five years. I'm set.
- Are you kidding? On the level?
- Yeah.
- He got it.
- He got it.
- I got...
- Yeah.
- Well, hello.
- Hello.
I beg your pardon.
This is Pat. She's a songwriter.
This is my friend Tommy.
- Howdy, Pat. A great night.
- How do you do?
They're throwing a party. Meet the gang.
Gosh, what news. What a break.
Who did you sign with?
- Eddie Cantor.
- Eddie Cantor. That's fi...
Only four minutes from Vine Street, but it's like a different world.
Here's where we all live, honey.
Not classy, but it's enough when you're on short dough.
Well, this is something even Ripley wouldn't believe.
Didn't cost us a dime.
We built the whole thing out of old discarded movie sets.
- Quaint, isn't it?
- Well, it's either very quaint or very corny.
Quaint or corny, I love it.
Good old Gower Gulch.
Kind of hate to leave it.
But... Well, it's hardly the right address for a radio star.
What do you do on the radio?
What do I do?
I sing.
Songs? Popular songs?
I don't mean "Shortnin' Bread. "
Oh, gosh. Oh, I suppose you sing whatever they tell you to, though, don't you?
Me? Not a chance. I sing what I like.
Really? Any song you want?
- They're not gonna tell Tommy Randolph.
- Oh, that's wonderful. Look...
I'm gonna pick all my tunes exclusively from the hit parade.
I'm smart enough to sing nothing but hits.
Now, here's a piece of furniture with a reputation.
- Oh, is it?
- Sit down?
- All right.
- Yes, sir. This is really something.
Humphrey Bogart and Ida Lupino...
...played a terrific love scene right in this thing.
My, still warm, isn't it?
Kind of romantic here, all right.
The moon and the stars and the moon.
Come on, sit down.
You know, my latest song was about the moon.
- Would you like to hear it?
- Some other time.
When Bogart was making love to Lupino right on this bench...
...he put his arm around her.
Yes, that was wonderful.
But I think Ida was much better in
Give the Little Girl a Break- Did you see it?
Not that I remember.
There was one scene where she goes to the home of this great singer.
She pleads with him. She pleads.
She says:
"You've got to listen to my song, do you hear? You've got to.
You've been putting me off long enough.
'Yes, Miss Dixon. No, Miss Dixon.
I've got to go, Miss Dixon. '
Don't you think I know you're not interested in my song? Or the moon, for that matter?
You've got it all figured out, haven't you?
You've been awfully smart, haven't you?
Well, get this: I wrote that song for you.
For you, do you hear?
You made me do it.
Yes. Yes, that's it. You made me do it. "
And then she sings that beautiful song about the moon.
I don't remember that picture at all.
Come on.
I'll show you where Joe and I live.
Here we are.
Home, sweet home. Cozy, isn't it?
"Home, Sweet Home. "
That's a good song.
Yeah. Step inside and look around.
All right.
Well, not much privacy, is there?
That's us. Always open house.
We salvaged this from The Roaring Twenties-
Remember Jimmy Cagney in that picture?
Do I remember Jimmy Cagney?
He was wonderful.
That big scene where he backs the crooked producer up against the wall and he says:
"Look here, sonny boy.
Are you gonna listen to this kid's song? Or do I slap you in the kisser with a grapefruit?
So it's not on the hit parade.
It's not on the hit parade.
So what? You're gonna put it there, see?
Because little Jimmy told you to, see?
When you sing it, you're not doing me a favor. No. You're doing yourself a favor.
But just the same, my mother thanks you, my father thanks you...
...my sister thanks you and I thank you. "
And then he does that terrific dance routine.
All right, don't knock yourself out.
I'll listen to your song.
- Oh, swell. You'll love the title. I call it...
Tommy.
- Tommy Randolph? Tommy.
- Yeah?
Come on back, will you?
- Who are we throwing this party for?
- Okay.
- Hurry. Hurry up.
- Let's go.
Wait, aren't you gonna listen to my song?
You heard what Charlie said. Come on.
Here he is now.
- Okay, okay, do you want action?
- Yes.
- All right. We'll give it to you.
- Yeah.
- Let them have it, Spike.
- All right.
Sprinkle me with perfume rare
And I'll be on my way
Stick some slickum on my hair
I may be gone all day
Oh, I'm ridin' for a fall
Dudin' up, dudin' up
In my shirts and ties

Oh, I'm ridin' for a fall
Dudin' up, dudin' up
In my two-tone shoes
For the gal with the baby blues
Oh, yes, I know
She's a dangerous critter, I know
She's a dangerous critter, I know
She's a dangerous critter, I know
But I can't quit her
I'm ridin' for a fall
Dudin' up, dudin' up like I wasn't wise
To the gal with the big blue eyes
Oh, yes, I know
She's a witch of a woman, I know
She's a witch of a woman
I know, she's a witch of a woman
I know
But I'm so human
I'm ridin' for a fall
Dudin' up, dudin' up like I wasn't wise
To the gal with the big blue eyes
Oh, yes, I know
People died of her cookin', I know
People died of her cookin', I know
People died of her cookin'
But, oh, she's so good-lookin'
I'm ridin' for a fall
Dudin' up, dudin' up like I wasn't wise
To the gal with the big blue eyes
- Oh, yes, I know
- Oh, yes, I know
- She's a quick on the trigger, I know
- Oh, yes, I know
- She's a quick on the trigger, I know
- Oh, yes, I know
- She's a quick on the trigger
- I know
But, oh, that figure
I'm ridin' for a fall
Dudin' up, dudin' up like I wasn't wise
To the gal with the big blue eyes
Oh, yes, I know
- She'll be spendin' my sugar
- I know
- She'll be spendin' my sugar
- I know
- She'll be spendin' my sugar
- But, oh
Oh, you can't rhyme sugar
I'm ridin' for a fall
Dudin' up, dudin' up like I wasn't wise
To the gal with the big blue eyes
- Yes, I'm ridin' for a fall
- Yes, I'm ridin' for a fall
Dudin' up, dudin' up like I wasn't wise
To the gal with the big blue eyes
Dudin' up, dudin' up like I wasn't wise
To the gal with the big blue eyes
Dudin' up, dudin' up like I wasn't wise
To the gal with the big blue eyes
You made the mistake of your life signing up with that Cantor.
He'll clip you somehow.
Joe, will you just take me to the man's home? I can take care of myself.
I'll breeze in, knock the old boy dead with numbers.
- After we settle the billing...
- You'll sing him "Moondust. "
- Yeah.
- "Moondust"? What's "Moondust"?
Well, that's my song.
Tommy's gonna sing it for his new boss.
Yeah, I kind of promised Pat last night.
Why not?
- If a guy's got influence, he should use it.
- That's right.
If you'll sing that song, you'd better get familiar with the lyric.
Go ahead. Read them.
Let's see, now.
"Moondust" by Irving Dixon.
- That's my pen name.
- Irving?
- Well, Berlin did all right with it.
- Yes, he did all right, yeah.
I'll just give you the first chorus.
"Moondust, you shone from above.
Moondust, you lit up my love.
Moondust, you gave love a shove right into my arms. "
Solid, huh?
- Yeah, yes, very good.
- Yeah, that's good. That's good.
"Moondust, why did I fall?
Moondust, why did love call?
Moondust, you had so much on the ball.
That you made me fall for his charms. "
- Arms and charms, that's nice rhyme.
- Yeah?
- Quite unusual. It's like moon and spoon.
- It's solid.
Now, dig this finish.
"Though he looked like grade A beneath that old Milky Way, he left me.
But now I'm wise.
There's no kiss on my lips.
There's a total eclipse because, moondust, you got in my eyes. "
All it needs is a little more moondust.
Yeah? I got a lot of extra choruses too, you know?
- You'll never top that one.
- Oh, thanks.
You think this song is right for Mr. Cantor?
Nobody else should ever have that number.
Let me get this straight.
You want Dinah Shore for a benefit?
- What kind of a benefit?
- It's just one of those things.
You know, for allied charities.
Allied charity? You mean the Cavalcade of Stars this Saturday?
That's it.
Every star in the business will be there.
It will be the biggest, the greatest.
It will be a nice little show.
Little show? Why, it'll be sensational.
- Well, of course you can have Dinah Shore.
- Really?
- Olaf, how long have we been at that thing?
- About 15 minutes.
Enough. I don't wanna get tired.
Can you have Dinah Shore?
You certainly can.
She'll be marvelous.
Dinah will come and sing a song.
I'll do seven or eight numbers, half an hour, with applause, 45 minutes.
Before I get through, it'll be a great show.
A great show.
Mr. Cantor, really,
I don't believe that you understand.
You don't grip the point we are driving into.
Even if we didn't have a reason to not want you...
...which we got, we still don't want you.
- Yup.
- No, no, no.
What Dr. Schlenna is trying to say is...
...that we are using motion-picture names exclusively.
Motion...? I've been a star for years.
Won't you call me a name?
Oh, definitely.
But not the kind I could put in lights.
That's very funny.
I know what you're thinking about.
I'm gonna use old jokes. Like when
I walk into a store and the woman says:
"Sonny, would you mind holding that door open?"I said,"Sonny?
I'd like to have you know
I'm the father of five girls. "
She said, "Would you mind repeating that?"
I said, "Not if I can help it. "
Oh, yes. I've always laughed at that one.
I don't do those old jokes anymore.
How would you like to hear a song they wrote for me today?
- No.
- Fine. I'll let you hear it.
- Oh, but, we haven't time.
- Olaf.
A couple of choruses.
It'll take half an hour.
Olaf, do you remember the number?
- I'll fake it.
- Just a minute, Olaf. That's fine.
Boys, sit down.
I always like to give the help a treat.
They love me.
Uh-oh.
- He's on again.
- If I have to hear him sing once more...
...I'll scream.
- Here we go again.
- And what about the roast beef?
Never mind the roast beef.
We gotta watch the ham.
Come on, everybody.
One way of keeping your help, entertain them.
Come on, everybody.
Get ready for your treat.
I always try out my new songs on the household staff.
If they laugh, I use the new song.
If they don't...
We'll get a new staff.
Play, Olaf.
Thank you for your cordial invitation
Mrs- Jones
But with nightclub life, we're through
Nonessential spending brings inflation
Mrs- Jones
So here's what we're planning to do
We're staying home tonight
My baby and me
Doing the patriotic thing
I've got my income-tax return to hurdle
And she'll be saving mileage
On her girdle
Don't wanna roam tonight
We're snug as can be
Hoping the phone will never ring
The landlord never told us
When we moved in this flat
That you can use the fireside
For more than a chat
We're staying home tonight
My baby and me
Doin' the patriotic thing
We're staying home tonight
Baby and me
Having a patriotic time
It's not that Mommy
Doesn't trust her poppy
It's just that we don't trust our old jalopy
Don't wanna roam tonight
We're snug as can be
Being alone is just sublime
While I sit in my slippers
And munch a piece of fruit
She'll iron out the wrinkles
In my victory suit
We're staying home tonight
My baby and me
Having a patriotic time
We'll play a game of rummy
It's cheaper than The Ritz
The winner wins a kiss
And just in case of a blitz
We're staying home tonight
My baby and me
Having a patriotic time
Her coffee could be sweeter
But I'm not in the dumps
Because every time she hugs me
It's like two extra lumps
We're staying home tonight
Baby and me
Having a patriotic time
What? Only one bow?
They love me.
- Wait for me. I'll be out soon.
- Good luck. We'll keep our fingers crossed.
Boys, I can't understand it.
Me with my experience in benefits.
Why don't you want me? Why?
Well, Mr. Cantor, to be brutally frank...
...you have the reputation of taking over everything you participate in.
Me? I take over?
Yes, please.
Yes, the whole town knows it.
You're nothing but an old fussbudget.
- Me?
- That's right.
You are an old fudgerbudget.
A buzz... Buzzerbudget... Fudge...
What he said.
- But, boys.
- No, no, no...
Boys, I am merely trying to help.
Merely trying to help.
That is the trouble.
We don't need help, Mr. Cantor.
I'm staging this show.
We are striving for an esoteric production.
Satirically, intime-
Aesthetically, entrez nous-
And we don't want it stunk up.
Yes, yeah. That's what we don't want it.
- What?
- Stunk up.
That's... That I can say.
Listen, all we want is Dinah Shore.
If you want Dinah, take her. She's yours.
As for myself, I want nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
- Oh, well, thank you, Mr. Cantor.
- Thank you. Thank you.
I want nothing at all.
You'll make me chairman of the committee?
- Chairman of the committee?
Why, certainly.
- That is out. Definitely out.
- Right. If that's the way you feel about it...
...no Cantor, no Dinah Shore and no sandwiches.
- No, no, no.
- Very well. Come, Schlenna.
Wait a minute, boys. Let's not be hasty.
Of course, we can talk this thing over...
Hi, Mr. Cantor.
I'm glad to see you. I'm Tommy.
You see, you don't have to rush away...
Who?
Tommy Randolph.
You know, radio program.
- Radio program?
- Yeah.
Look, I'm busy. I'll see you.
- As I was saying...
- Take your time.
After all, we got a whole career ahead of us, eh, Eddie?
There's no point to any further discussion. Come.
You don't understand.
I'm sure that we can iron this thing out.
We don't want to iron.
We just want Dinah Shore.
I discovered her.
I discovered Dinah Shore.
- She isn't the only one, eh, Eddie?
- Of course not. Why, she...
Look, young man, I'm a little bit busy and I'll see you in a few minutes.
Is that all right?
How can you think of Dinah working without me?
It's like bread without butter, ham without eggs.
- Like Cantor without Randolph.
- Cantor without Randolph.
- Who's Randolph?
- Who's Randolph?
Combination of Dennis Day,
Kenny Baker and Bing Crosby...
...all rolled into one, that's all.
- Look...
Whoever you are, just take a nice long walk or a swim, will you?
Will you do that for me?
- I'm sure that we can get together.
- Not on your terms, Mr. Cantor.
Your whole attitude has been highly uncooperative, extremely ungenerous.
Wait a minute. Wait.
- You can't talk like that to Mr. Cantor.
- Quiet.
- He's the most generous man I've met.
- Speak up.
- Everybody knows Mr. Cantor's generosity.
- There you are.
- What was I yesterday?
- Yeah.
- Nothing, nobody.
- Nobody.
- What am I today?
- What?
A star. And you wanna know why?
- Go on, tell them, son.
- I'll tell you why.
Because this man, the soul of generosity, took me, an unknown kid...
...without an audition.
Took me and signed me up to a contract.
The boy is right. He's absolutely ri...
Contract? What are you talking about?
What kind of a contract?
- I've got it right with me, boss.
- Well, who-?
- Nobody's going around insulting Eddie.
- No, no, no.
Not while he's got me for a hundred bucks.
Say, this is a contract.
Silly of me to forget.
Oh, Olaf.
That's all right.
You've got plenty on your mind.
Plenty. Olaf, this young man has a contract with me.
Let's show him inside, shall we?
Don't trouble yourselves, Eddie.
Oh, no trouble at all, eh, Olaf?
It's a pleasure.
I'll see you in a minute, gentlemen.
Tommy's been in there quite a while now.
- I wonder how he's coming out.
Stay out of here.
Gentlemen, have you reached a decision?
Oh, yes. Yes, Mr. Cantor, we have.
- And against our better judgment...
- We must have Dinah Shore.
So we have decided to make you chairman of the benefit committee.
But it is clearly understood the position is entirely honorary...
...and you are not to interfere with the show.
Me interfere with the show? Me...?
If I interfere, I hope I never take a bow again as long as I live.
Why, I won't even come to rehearsal.
One, two
Now you're dancing
One, two, watch your tempo
Play that music
Pizzicato
You girls get over there
Hold that tempo
Now, girls, follow me
One, two, three, four
Look. Look. Look what he does with that beautiful music...
...and my orchestration.
Your orchestration.
What about my dance routine?
- He's ruined it. He's ruined it, I tell you.
- I know it.
And why? Because you had to make him chairman of the committee.
And why?
Because you had to have Dinah Shore.
Please don't blame me with your blaming.
Blame you? Who's blaming you?
I am. That's who.
Please. Well, why don't you insult him like we discussed it?
Why don't you insult him like we discussed it?
I will tell you.
Because you are more disgusting than me.
Is that so?
Who do you think you are anyway?
Wait a minute, girls. Hold everything.
Boys, stop playing the music.
Stop the music.
Gentlemen, you are ruining my rehearsal.
Your rehearsal? Our rehearsal.
You're ruining our rehearsal.
But, boys, what have I done?
We had this number rehearsed and perfect four hours ago.
And then you came into the picture.
And let me tell you, we're about fed up with you and your interference.
Fed up, do you hear me? Up to here.
- Aren't we, doctor?
- Higher.
You see?
I can't understand it.
You should thank me for coming.
The music was bad.
The lighting was no good.
But one thing I will say, who designed that costume?
- That's my work. I did.
- Congratulations.
Someone should give you a hotfoot up to here.
Higher.
- What's that animal it shouldn't happen to?
- A dog.
That's it.
Now, girls, we'll try it again.
Boys, close your curtains.
I wanna keep this very intimate.
Come down here.
This will be the biggest thing
I've ever done.
And I've done some big things.
Sometimes I even frighten myself.
Now, listen to me.
We've got to do something about Cantor.
We gotta get rid of him. You take him away someplace and talk to him.
- Oh, no.
- Talk to him.
I don't want to talk to him. No, no.
He told me today three times the story of his life. No. No, no, no.
The story of his life?
Why, that's it.
That is it. The story of his life.
Doctor, you're a genius.
Naturally.
Keep the line straight. You're doing fine.
It's by accident. That's it.
Mr. Cantor.
- Yes, sir.
- You're wanted on the telephone.
- Thank you, son. Son?
Hello? Just a minute, please.
- Who's winning?
- I am.
I've got half of your game. Yes?
Mr. Cantor, this is Colonel Robert E. Jefferson...
...of the Montgomery Post Gazette, sir.
Yes, sir.
Look, I'm a very busy man and I'm not doing any advertising this year.
We allow as how you're very busy, sir...
...but what we all down...
Down here wants from you all up there...
...is the complete story of your life, sir.
My life?
A pleasure, colonel. I'll make it brief.
Just pull up a chair.
You begin right at the beginning, sir, and don't omit any of the details...
...no matter how boring they may be, sir.
Yes, sir.
Fine. Well, colonel, my ancestors crossed the plains in the first covered wagon.
If you ever saw my ancestors, you'd understand why the wagon was covered.
Ha-ha-ha. Don't print that.
- I was born in September...
- Psst. Boy.
Yes.
- Tell Dr. Schlenna to put...
...that Jack Carson-Alan Hale number on right away.
The Carson-Hale number, Dr. Schlenna.
Weren't you on the bill with me
In Dallas?
Or was it the Palace?
Or was it the Strand?
Didn't you have a blond with you
Named Alice?
Yes, that was in Dallas
And wasn't she grand?
I know your face, it's a face in a million
Shake, brother, shake
With a brother vaudevillian
- Hello. Hello.
- Hello. Hello.
You look all ready to go
But where you're goin' to go
I certainly wish you'd let me know
- Goodbye. Goodbye.
- Goodbye. Goodbye.
A happy follow am I
And though you'll call me an awful sap
Who? Me?
I found a wonderful spot on the map
I'm goin' North
He's goin' North
Not talkin' about South
Not talkin' about South
Not talkin' about West
One place he loves best
I'm shoutin'
I don't wanna live without the...
- Why don't they write a song about the...?
- North
- You heard him say North
- Not talkin' about East
He never mentioned East
I just wanna feast
Oh, boy, what a feast
- These eyes on Syracuse and Albany
- Buffalo and Schenectady
North is my favorite direction
Pointin' to the State of Maine
Pardon me, boy
If that's the Chattanooga Choo Choo
Well, I guess I must be
On the wrong train
- Because I'm heading
- North
I think you mean it
I've been back and forth
You've really seen it?
Oh, Mother
You can take a rock and slam me
If I should ever call you Mammy
Way up North
- Two, three, four
- Two, three, four
- Six, seven, eight
- Six, seven, eight
Stop, I'm goin' North
He's still goin' North
Too lazy down South
Hates the sugar cane in his mouth
Too lonely out West
Pardner, get it off your chest
I can't begin to tell you how I love the...
- Cities and states and counties of the...
- North-
He knows his own mind
Northeast will not do
He's quite particular
Northwest gets me blue
He's perpendicular
Head straight
For Saskatoon, Saskatchewan
Labrador and on and on to the North
That's my favorite direction
Pointin' up to Hudson Bay
Pardon me, boy
But when the midnight choo-choo leave
For Alabama
I won't be goin' your way
- Because I'm headin'
- North
He'll never have a famine
I've been back and forth
He lives on Nova Scotia salmon
You'll find me
Where there is no cotton pickin'
Never again to fry a chicken
Way up North
- Stop, the North is my favorite direction
- Stop, the North is my favorite direction
- Pointin' to the Arctic Sea
- Pointin' to the Arctic Sea
Pardon me, boy,
Is this the road to Mandalay?
Well, you can go to Mandalay but not me
Because we're headin'
- North
- Is that your attitude?
I've been back and forth
In every latitude?
We are the only act in vaudeville
That never will be content
Until we're way up
- Mush
- Hey
- Way up
- Way up
We're not from Dixie
- Way up
- Way up
- We are from hunger
- We are from hunger
- Way up North
- Way up North
Yes, sir. Anyway, colonel, thanks to perseverance and clean living...
...by the time I was 2 years old,
I made money to retire.
So I kept right on working.
When I was 3, I entered school, but at the end of the first term, I quit...
...and opened up a school of my own.
Some months later, I was married and everybody congratulated my wife-
I was the catch of the season-
- Hello.
- How are you?
Congratulations, Charlie. I'm glad somebody in Gower Gulch got a job.
Yeah, that's swell.
Just heard about it, fellows.
Don't let these Cherokee union suits fool you.
We got all dolled up to take publicity pictures with Edward G. Robinson.
We made him an honorary chief.
It's a newspaper plug for Cavalcade of Stars-
That's that benefit Saturday night, isn't it?
Yeah. I've got to get out of these things.
My girdle is killing me.
The Cavalcade of Stars-
Boy, that's really gonna be a show.
Bette Davis, Ann Sheridan,
Humphrey Bogart.
What a benefit. Every big shot's there.
I'm my best in front of a professional audience.
If I had a chance to sing for a crowd like that, I bet I'd get a dozen contracts.
You want an aspirin? What's the matter?
- I've got an idea. Why don't you do it?
- What don't I what?
Go to the theater and tell them to put you on Saturday.
Pat, you forget one little item.
You know I have a great voice, so do I.
They don't.
Let me give you a tip.
In show business, you've got to have poise.
Be professional. Be aggressive.
Be egotistical. You understand?
With my personality,
I couldn't get through that stage door.
Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.
Joe, can you get him in?
After all, Davis and I are pals.
Bette Davis, the actress?
No. Max Davis, the doorman.
- Come on, then. What are we waiting for?
- Wait a minute. I'm not so sure.
Yeah, but it's worth a try.
If it works, it'll be a break for you.
Oh, and for "Moondust" too.
- Yeah, "Moondust. "
- Yeah, "Moondust. "
- Well, let's go.
- Let's go.
She said, "Let's go. "
This ought to make great reading-
Inspirational stuff- Now, to continue-
By that time,
I had five lovely daughters, all girls.
That's the year I made
Whoopie for Ziegfeld.
Am I boring you, colonel?
Yes, indeed.
Oh, certainly not, Mr. Cantor.
No, of course not.
It's most interesting. Pray, continue, sir.
- Mr. Farnsworth.
- What do you want?
- Have you got time for Ann Sheridan?
- Have I got time for A...?
The question is, has Ann Sheridan got time for me?
Have we got time to rehearse her number?
Oh, the number? Yes. Go ahead with it.
Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead.
Go ahead with Ann Sheridan.
Come on, boys, boys, boys.
"And so, young ladies, feminine charm and dignity must be preserved.
Let man pursue, let woman elude. "
It is always thus that love is born.
Here is a book, enormous, on how to conduct our lives.
Everything will come to her who waits
But how long must a lady wait for dates?
Somebody please inform us
Exactly how love arrives
You've got to join in the chase yourself
Now, here's my story, so brace yourself
Love isn't born on a beautiful April morn
Love isn't born, it's made
And that's why every window
Has a window shade
Love can't do much
For a couple who don't quite touch
Love needs a chance to advance
And that's why folks who never cared
For dancin', dance
So, my precious young dove
If you're waitin' for love
Better make the most of your charms
For the feelin' won't start
In the gentleman's heart
Till you're in the gentleman's arms
Love isn't born
That's a fable to treat with scorn
Let's call a spade a spade
When he says
"Dear, come up and see my antique jade"
Remember, love isn't born
It's made
How true, how true, how very, very true
It's all a game
How wise, how wise, how very, very wise
To fan the flame
That old Prince Charming story
Was a fake
The Sleeping Beauty
Must have been awake
You've got us all believing in you
Continue, please continue
Love has to climb
It can't suddenly ring that chime
Climb, sister, time is short
Sister, won't you be a sport?
You'll find there's no partition
In a davenport
No partition, no partition in a davenport
Love doesn't act
Till the cards are discretely stacked
Here is a fact to face
Yes, you gotta face the fact
A man won't take a taxi
Just to get no place
How they hate a taxi gettin' no place
So, my precious young dove
If you're dreamin' of love
Better lead him into the trap
For you'll never remain
On the gentleman's brain
Till you're on the gentleman's lap
- Love won't exist
- Oh, no
If you constantly slap that wrist
You do and you'll be
Right off his list, you'll fade
Yes, you gotta be careful
So don't keep cryin' wolf
At every gay young blade
And when you walk alone and forlorn
And then you hear a Cadillac horn
Remember, love isn't born
It's made
- Uh-oh. Max Davis.
- What about him?
- That's not him.
- Huh?
Well, let's go home and wash the bus.
- No, wait. Let's wash this up first.
- That's right.
When Tommy Randolph says he's gonna get in someplace, nobody keeps him out.
Now you're talking. That's what I call taking the bull by the horns.
Yeah, but look at that bull.
Hello.
- Where are you going?
- There. I gotta see a man about a job.
You must have skipped reading when you went to school.
Why, nobody gets in there.
Now, blow, will you? Blow.
If Tommy wants to get in, nobody keeps him out.
Nobody except the doorman.
Uh-oh. What now? Another idea?
And what an idea. Come on, Joe.
Now wait, you don't understand.
I understand my orders.
Nobody goes in there without a written pass.
Now, blow, kiddie.
You can't do it. You can't break my heart and toss me aside like a flower.
- You can't do it, Harry.
- But... But... But Harry.
Oh, don't hit me again. Please don't.
All I ask is bread for our three little babies.
Oh, please, Harry. Don't twist my arm.
You've got me mixed up with somebody else. It's Joe.
You beast.
How can you let your children starve...
...while you buy champagne for that hussy?
- Can I be of assistance?
- How dare you interfere in a conversation.
Will you mind your business?
Champagne?
- I was only...
- Keep your mouth out of this.
- If we need your help, we'll ask for it.
- Yes.
You think you're a wise guy or something.
Yes, I'm a wise guy or something.
- Go on-
What about it? Plenty about it.
You think you're tough, huh?
I'm tough.
Wanna make something out of it?
Take off them glasses, shrimp.
All right, there.
What are you gonna do about it?
Well, hello, gentlemen.
How do you do?
We're very busy and I'm...
- Oh, hello. How are you?
- Hello.
That was some clambake at the pool yesterday.
- Cantor made a horse's neck out of me.
- Horse's neck?
Together with us, that makes one complete horse.
Nobody can treat me like that and get away.
If I ever lay my hands on the broken-down runt...
- Yes, yes, go on.
- I'll break every bone in his body.
You will kick him a few times too, yes?
And maybe step on his face a little?
Well, I don't wanna bother you with my headache.
- I came to get in the show.
- In this show?
- Yes. Who do I see?
- You see us.
- No, no, no.
- No?
Yes, of course. Go right ahead. Not us.
We can't go over the head of the chairman.
- No, we can't.
- See the chairman of the committee.
Swell. Where do I find him?
Right in that office, there. Walk right in.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.
- You don't have to knock.
Then came the stock-market crash and I opened up an antique shop. Such antiques.
No, no. None of my jokes.
Come in. Well, of cour... Well, naturally.
Pardon me.
They told me I could find the...
You again?
Olaf.
Stay out of here.
Oh, I'm sorry, Joe.
Please, Pat, if you get any more ideas, leave me out of them.
- Well, you made a great sacrifice, Joe.
- Yeah.
At least we know
Tommy's sitting pretty.
Well, anyhow, sitting.
Oh, my jaw. How can you eat like that with the fall you took?
Where I landed, it doesn't hurt my appetite.
I can't help feeling we're overlooking something.
- There's a way to get Tommy in that show.
- I'd be in it if it weren't for that weasel.
I'll get even with him if I have to break every sidewalk in town.
Now you know how I feel.
I hope I never hear his obnoxious name again.
Eddie Cantor.
Please forgive me for laughing, but every time I see that ridiculous face...
Mr. Cantor, I simply must have an autograph.
- I'm sorry but I don't happen to be the...
- Those glasses didn't fool me.
I'd know little Eddie anywhere.
And those silly, silly eyes.
You will give me your autograph, won't you, pretty please?
- Look, I don't wanna disappoint you...
Go on.
Sign it.
Let the lady go back to her table, Eddie.
Eddie? Oh. Oh, oh.
Oh, thank you, you dear, dear funny man.
And remember, if you ever come to Peoria,
I'd like to spend some Wednesday with you.
Don't you forget now.
Goodbye.
Oh, I beg your pardon. Goodbye.
You see, I'm haunted. It's a curse.
Wait a minute, Joe.
- What's the matter, Pat? You got a pain?
- No, she's got another idea.
- I'm gonna fill the bus.
- No, wait.
If you were Eddie Cantor, you'd let Tommy sing tomorrow night, wouldn't you?
Of course he would. He's my pal.
All right, we'll cut his hair a little bit, take off those glasses...
...and presto,
Joe Simpson is Eddie Cantor.
Now, just a minute.
He goes down to the theater and tells them to put me on. I can see the whole thing.
If you can see me at the theater, you need glasses.
- No, I'm not gonna do it. Not even for you.
- Oh, but, Joe.
He's right, Tommy. It's too much to ask.
After all, a part like this requires great acting.
Acting? What do you mean, acting?
What a part. An actor's dream.
A chance to impersonate your own worst enemy?
- Too bad. Joe couldn't handle it.
- No.
Who couldn't handle it?
I, sir, am an actor.
Well, yeah.
But I don't think we can risk it.
But you've got to. This is my big chance.
What do your think, Pat?
Well, okay.
Thank you, Pat.
I'll never forget you for this.
- But how are we gonna get rid of Cantor?
- Huh?
You can't have the two of us running around the theater.
- Yeah, we've gotta get rid of him somehow.
- Yeah, but how?
You can't give him back to the Indians.
Indians. That's it.
Indians. Indians.
Uh. Uh-huh.
Sure, Joe. Be glad to help you out.
Don't do anything to him that won't hurt.
Don't worry.
We'll talk it over when you get here.
Thanks a million.
- How'd you make out?
- What did he say?
- What did he say? We're all set.
- I told you.
- Yeah.
- Good old Charlie.
- I'll show them I'm an actor.
- A great actor.
- This is the start of your new career.
- No more tourists, bus.
- What a pleasure.
- Hey, Joe.
Two suckers in the bus.
- Well, business before pleasure. So long.
- So long, Joe.
- Goodbye. See you later.
- Yeah.
Oh, if this only works.
- Pat, you were wonderful.
- Oh, sure.
- Sometimes being a genius comes in handy.
- No kidding.
When I get to be a star,
I'll thank you for it.
- Oh, think nothing of it.
- I think more of it than you realize.
Here's a cute number. "No You, No Me. "
It's kind of appropriate too.
Without you, I'll never be much
Without you, my plans will fall through
So I have prepared this reliable
Collection of facts undeniable
To point out how much I depend on you
No sunny little sunbeam
No springtime
No tasty little apple
No pie
No tricky little trombone
No swing time
No one and one, no two
Nothing could be more true
No rainy little raindrop
No ocean
No lovely one to sigh for
No sigh
Oh, honey.
And there's my little song of devotion
Which all adds up so obviously
No you, no me
No 60 little minutes
Oh, no hour
No healthy little moo-cow
No cream
No alternating current
No power
No great Tchaikovsky tunes
No hit-parade moons in June
No pretty little mirror
No reflection
No pretty little dream girl
No dreams
Plus lots of other terms of affection
Which all add up more personally
No you, no me
In other words, I'm hot on your trail
Mm-mm.
No sale
Mr. Farnsworth hates animals.
Better get this out before he sees it.
- Mr. Cantor ordered it and he got it.
- Well, don't say I didn't tell you.
I tell you, Schlenna. It is chaos.
Just utter chaos.
- You hear his latest idea?
- What?
He wants us to dress the girls as boiled potatoes...
...and have them dive in a tank of sour cream.
- Ridiculous. It would splash.
- Why...?
- Mr. Farnsworth.
- What?
- Attend to these?
- What?
- Just initial them.
- Why? Don't argue.
Please don't argue with me.
I tell you I can't stand anymore.
I can't stand it. No.
Seven hours till curtain time and Cantor wants to change our finale.
Oh, I tell you, he's just wrecking my life.
Thank you, Schlenna. Thank you.
I know exactly how you feel.
I know that I have your sympathy.
But if that man, Cantor, makes one more suggestion...
No, no. You must not lose your grip.
Whatever happens, keep...
A lion. Please, help. A lion. A lion.
- A lion.
- All right. No danger.
You just look him straight in the eye, huh?
But, here, halt, halt.
This I don't believe.
- What's the idea of these animals?
- They're for the Harlem number.
Mr. Cantor changed the scene to the jungle.
- Oh, he did, did he?
- Yes, sir.
You have those beasts sent back to Walt Disney.
- Where they belong.
- Yes.
- Why, this is preposterous.
- Preposterous.
- It's ridiculous.
- Ridiculous.
Schlenna, this is the end.
Yes, I can see that.
And Dinah Shore or no Dinah Shore,
I'm gonna tell him that right now.
- Mr. Cantor, we have...
- Go on, go on. Get out of here...
...and shut that door.
Mr. Cantor's occupied.
- Out, out, out.
- Oh, excuse me.
Out.
- Hey, hey, you.
- Hey, hey, who? Why you hey?
I'm talking to you.
Where would Eddie Cantor be?
If he would be where I like him to be, he's already crisp on both sides.
Wait. You know who you're talking to?
- No, you know who you are talking to?
- No. I don't care.
You, see. I was happy not to meet you. Goodbye.
- Just a minute, come back.
- Oh, no, no.
Come back here.
Don't you believe
Eddie Cantor wants to talk to me?
He's been sending me notes all day.
I'll show some notes to you.
- Notes to me?
- Yeah.
Notes to you too?
I'm a musician. I know more about notes than you do.
All right, all right. Cool off.
This is no time to be burning up all that good beef.
Keep your hands to myself.
And when I talk to you, keep a silly tongue in my head.
- Well, what did I do?
- Did I send for you?
- Why, no, but...
- Did I start this?
- Well, no, but...
- You mind my business and I mind yours.
Get out, stay out and never come back.
You understand?
Why, sure. If that's the way you want it.
Chiseler.
Let the old man bulldoze you, eh?
Yeah, that ain't like me.
Gee, I hope none of my movie fans hear about this.
Schlenna. Schlenna.
- What?
- Did you did it so fast?
- That big brute, Olaf. He's in there and he...
Oh, I tell you the whole thing is just hopeless.
Farnsworth, I got you into this complication.
- And it's up to me to make a mess out of it.
- Why?
I mean, who? How?
I tell Dinah Shore she's out of the show.
That is perfect and that will do it.
But you be firm with her, won't you?
Why, Dr. Schlenna, how nice.
Miss Shore, there is something
I must say to you.
Oh, please don't say Miss Shore.
I'm Dinah to you.
Oh, yes. Well, Dinah...
You're gonna scold me for not learning the ending. But I know it now. Listen.
- Is that right, doctor?
- Yes, beautiful.
Is beau... But, Miss Shore, Dinah...
- I just dropped in...
- And it was darn sweet of you too.
Imagine visiting me.
A great man like you.
But what I came... Like me?
You're not only a great conductor, but I think you're a terribly nice person.
But all I came here for is...
- You do?
- Yes.
- You know something, doctor?
- What?
- The minute I laid eyes on you...
- No, no, no.
...I had the most irresistible desire...
- Please, I have a wife in Malibu.
Oh, your wife won't mind.
I really can't resist it.
- I have little grandchildren.
- Won't you let me do it now?
- L... What?
- This.
Gee, Dinah, Dinah.
I just had to get that out of my system.
Now, what was it you wanted to talk to me about?
- Well, we just thought that...
- Yes?
Dinah, we thought when you are ready we run through your number.
All right.
You run along and I'll be right down.
And any time you want to...
- Please help yourself.
- All right.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Joe, I hate to do a thing like this to a nice fellow like you.
In all my life, I no see such a face.
He is repulsive, isn't he?
But do your best.
Don't you worry. When I finish, you're gonna look repulsive just like him.
Oh, Joe. The boys are getting impatient.
How's it coming?
Great. I'm getting uglier by the minute.
Angelo, what's cutting?
Haven't you finished yet?
Look, I am not a magician.
To cut hair, takes just so long.
- Angelo.
- Shut up.
If you want artistic job, you see Angelo.
If you want speed, you see Mr. Henry Kaiser.
Hey, Tommy, you know it's 1:00?
Yeah. Let's get going.
Hey, what I got here?
Wash bowl or Rose Bowl?
Look at this, Angelo.
You left the sides too full.
Look at that kisser.
How could he let anyone photograph him from the side?
You had a pan like that, you wouldn't show more than half of it.
- That's fine, Angelo. It's perfect.
- That looks pretty good to me.
- There, I'm all finished.
- Oh, and you made good time too.
Here you are, Joe.
Thank you, Angelo.
I think you did a great job.
- Thank you.
- I'm beginning to hate myself already.
Well, here you are. And this is for you.
- What's the matter? Five cents of tips?
- So long, Angelo.
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go.
We gotta hurry, now.
Come on.
Gentlemen, final rehearsal.
And for Dinah Shore, play like you never played before.
Play good.
The early birdie used to sing
Go to work, go to work
Better go to work
And a day was a busy thing
But now without you, you
That birdie sings another tune
Stay asleep, stay asleep
Better stay asleep
All morning, night and noon
The dreamer, the dreamer
I reckon that's my name
Since you're gone away
But how am I gonna see you
Unless I dream all day?
All the long and miserable day
They call me the dreamer
They tell me it's a shame
How lazy I seem
But how am I gonna hold you
Unless I dream, dream, dream?
So I stroll among the trees
Like I didn't have a chore to do
And I let the summer breeze
Come and kiss me like a real and true
Kiss from you
The dreamer, the dreamer
I reckon that's my name
Why change it?
What for?
I wanna stay a dreamer
Till you're home once more
So I stroll among the trees
Like I didn't have a chore to do
And I let the summer breeze
Come and kiss me like a real and true
Kiss from you
The dreamer, the dreamer
I reckon that's my name
Why change it?
What for?
I wanna stay a dreamer
Till you're home once more
Till you're home and waking me up
Once more
Till you're home
And waking me up
Once more
I don't wanna press you, are you still pressing my coat?
- I'm on the trousers now, boss.
- Well, then shake a leg.
You get it? Trousers? Shake a leg?
Oh, yeah. That's a hot one, boss.
- Olaf.
- Please, boss, stop. You're killing me.
I can't help myself. Every word that comes out of my mouth is a scream.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
Come in.
What's going on? You're in the wrong room.
Gene Autry's two doors down.
We come bring heap, big greeting.
How!
Lookit, I'm on the warpath.
- Will you please get out?
- How.
The same way you came in. That's how.
We come, take you in Indian brotherhood.
Make you honorary chief.
Boys, that honorary gag's been done so often, it's corny.
You no want be chief?
We tell white squaw from LIFE magazine go away.
Wait a minute. You mean there's a lady here from LIFE magazine?
- Uh.
- Where? Outside?
Uh.
Gonna take picture?
Put them in magazine?
- Uh.
- Say, I'll bet I'll look good at that, huh?
Uh-uh.
- That's fine. I'll do it.
- Good. You put them on war bonnet.
Oh, come here. Finchley, Olaf.
Look, I'm a warrior.
I'll bet this'll keep my wig warm.
Let's see the mirror. See how I look.
I'll bet at that I could pass as an Indian.
That is, with reservations.
What's the matter? Tired of your jobs?
- Oh, no, boss.
- Well, let's go.
Remember, the men you wanna see are Farnsworth and Schlenna.
They're both burned at Cantor.
So handle them with kid gloves.
Handle them.
Don't know what they look like.
Joe, you can't miss. Schlenna looks like a beer barrel. Farnsworth, like a moose.
- A moose?
- Here's his clothes and step on it.
- They'll be out in a minute.
- Hurry up. Put them on, Joe.
Little chief look good.
Must wear many feathers.
Yeah. I hope I don't get caught in a badminton game.
What's he doing now?
Maybe they are going to smoke a piece of pipe.
Yeah, pies of peep.
Pike's Peak.
Pipe of peace.
Well, if they do, I hope there's a mickey in the tobacco.
- You got it straight?
- Yeah.
Schlenna's a beer barrel and Farnsworth is a moose.
Duck, here they come.
How do you do? Step right up here.
It won't take a minute.
- Thank you.
- Look right into the camera, please.
Wearing this suit reminds me of a gag I once did.
Don't move your head.
Indian comes up to me, says,
"It's tough for us Indians. "
I said, "You don't like it...
...why don't you go back where you came from?" Laugh.
Knocked them silly. How's this?
Just about perfect. Still.
Okay. Let's have it.
Hurry up, boys. Come on.
Look, look, look.
They are kid-snatching him.
My, my, my.
We should maybe call the police. No?
- No.
- No.
Get going. Good luck.
Don't you think we give him one more tap to make sure?
Oh, he'll be fine.
See you later, Mr. Cantor.
- Okay.
- Your glasses, Joe.
Oh, I'm such a dope.
Keep thinking, Joe.
Why did you hit me, Ida?
Gee, what a celebration.
You don't think they will be too easy on him?
- Easy? On Cantor?
- No.
Those Indians?
Look what they did to General Custer.
And he was a very nice fellow.
Oh, and I didn't know him.
Hello.
Oh, pardon me.
I've had enough of you, you wolf.
- And now a toast.
- Toast?
I give you the American Indians, and I add my admiration.
And I give the Indians Eddie Cantor, and I add my wife's relatives.
Come, come. Get to work.
My, when I think of what that owl face could have done to our finale...
His finale would have been our ending.
Imagine Schlenna, moments ago, that egotistical screwball...
...was making our lives miserable.
- Where is he now?
Who cares, as long as he isn't here.
- Hello.
- How do you do?
Tell you, we are the luckiest people in the whole world.
Why, Eddie.
What's the matter?
- What's wrong? You look fine.
- Why not? I am fine.
But you passed us like we was intimate strangers.
- Yes, didn't you know us?
- Know you?
Well, of course I know you.
Well, of course. You are the beer barrel and you are the moose.
A moose? I'm a Rotarian.
Who's a moose?
You are the moose and I'm the barrel of beer.
Oh, remember?
Oh, a moose. Oh, yes, yes.
Listen, I know you fellows have been unhappy with my ideas...
...so let's forget them, huh?
- What?
You don't want the avocados coming out of gopher holes?
Avocados?
No, no avocados.
And no lady potatoes splashing in the tartar sauce?
- No? No? No?
- No lady potatoes. No. No. No.
Forget them.
Go back to your original staging.
Well, well, well.
All I want is to have my protégé sing tonight. Remember? Tommy Randolph?
Randolph? The boy, what, took you out from the door twice? The boy?
- Yes. He's my dearest friend.
- Your dearest friend?
Why, yes. Will you do it, please?
- Schlenna?
- No.
I tell you. You promise not to butt in again and it's a deal.
I promise. Tommy is waiting outside.
I'll go and get him.
I'll go and get him. He's on the outside.
Schlenna, you're right. That blow on the head has caused loss of memory.
- That man has amnesia.
- On him it's becoming.
- Well, anyway, our troubles are over.
- Yes, they are over.
- Unless he remembers what he forgot.
- Oh, well, in that case, look.
If he does?
- We'll keep this handy, huh?
- No, no, no.
Come.
Miss Hattie McDaniel and Mr. Willie Best.
On-stage, everybody, for the "Ice Cold Katie" number.
Private Jones is campin'
On the doorstep of Miss Katie Brown
She must be the very, very coldest
Creature in this town
- He's been there
- For seven days and nights
And now his leave is through
- And still she won't
- Still she won't, still she won't say
I do
Brrrr
Ice-cold Katie
Won't you marry the soldier?
Ice-cold Katie, won't you do it today?
Ice-cold Katie
Won't you marry the soldier?
Soon he'll march away
Yeah, ice-cold Katie
He's a-dyin' to hold you
Keep that date, he came a-hurryin' for
Ice-cold Katie
Won't you marry the soldier?
Soon he's off to war
Here I am outside
Ringin', ringin', ringin' on your bell
Ringin' so long
He's gonna be A-W-O-L
Ice-cold Katie
Won't you do what I told you?
Ice-cold Katie
You're the talk of the town
Ice-cold Katie, please marry the soldier
Melt, melt, melt on down
Ice-cold Katie Brown
Here comes the justice
Lord, bless the justice
Here comes the justice now
I was here at 7
I was here at 10
I was here at 11
- And I positively won't be back again
- I don't blame you
- Is the ring all ready?
- Ask him
- Did the bride get sense?
- No
Is the groom a-feelin' steady
After all the matrimonial suspense?
Is there cake and candy?
- Is the choir in tune?
- We is
Is the fee handy?
The private may be leavin' mighty soon
Kate, Kate, Kate, Katie
Won't you step outside?
Everything is ready but the bride
Ice-cold Katie
Won't you marry the soldier?
Ice-cold Katie, won't you do it today?
Ice-cold Katie
Why don't you marry that soldier?
Soon he'll march away
Ice-cold Katie, he's just dyin' to hold you
Ice-cold Katie
How he grumbles and groans
Ice-cold Katie
Won't you marry the soldier?
Private Jones, don't you know
You ain't got no
Got no, got no time to spare?
Don't you know we're all sailin'
Sailin', sailin' over there?
Ice-cold Katie
Won't you do what I told you?
Ice-cold Katie, ain't a moment to lose
Ice-cold Katie
Won't you marry the soldier?
Looks like rice and shoes
Spread, spread, spread the news
Here goes the justice
Just watch the justice
Here goes the justice now
- Do you take this woman?
- Of course
- Do you take this man?
- Go ahead
Well, young man and young woman
You'd better get a little loving
While you can
- That's right
- I now pronounce you man and wife
- That's over
- I never had such trouble in my life
Private Jones, don't you know
You ain't got no time to spare?
Don't you know they are sailin'
Sailin', sailin' over there?
Ice-cold Katie
Won't you marry the soldier
Ice-cold Katie, with the shivery frown
Ice-cold Katie
Went and married the soldier
Ice-cold Katie Brown
She got her man
Oh, Katie, she got her man
Oh, Katie, she got her man
Oh, Katie, she's
Katie Brown
Help.
Help. Let me out of here.
Quit that yelling, Cantor.
- Shut up.
- I will not shut up.
- Do you fellows realize who I am?
- Yeah.
- That's what makes it such a pleasure.
- Oh, boys, please.
I've gotta get back to the theater.
Remember, the show must go on.
It'll go on, all right, but without you.
Here, Junior. Here, boy.
Here, Junior. Junior.
- That's Junior?
- Yeah.
Well, what's Senior, a horse?
And don't holler at him. He hates noise.
And he loves the taste of blood.
He'll be awfully disappointed.
I'm anemic.
Now, don't go away.
We're going out for a bite.
Watch him, Junior.
Fine thing. They're going out for a bite and you came in for one.
Here, Junior.
Come back here, Junior.
See what I have in my hand.
Bite the rope, Junior. It's delicious rope.
It's imported. Bite it.
Bite it in the back like a nice little doggie.
Come on, bite it, will you?
That hurt.
Indians.
Indians. Indians.
Help. Help.
Maple syrup. Now I'm a wheat cake.
Get out of there.
Get away from my toe, you heel.
Junior.
What?
Junior, get... Get away from there.
Stop it. Stop it.
Junior, is that your family?
Oh, get me out of here.
Indians. Indians. Get out.
Go on. Go home, you mutts.
Oh, leave me alone, please?
What have I done to you?
Get away from there. Get away.
Operator. Opera...
Stop with that thing.
I'm trying to get the Indians.
This is more important.
Are you sure of that middle, now?
How can I concentrate on the song when my dress suit isn't here yet?
We're in trouble.
The Indians don't answer.
- Maybe they're not there.
- That's just it.
Suppose Cantor broke loose, he comes in and finds out what we've done.
Suppose these people learn
I'm Joe Simpson.
I can't understand about my suit.
I've been doing business with that pawnbroker for years.
Suit. If Cantor shows up here, we'll all get new suits.
And I don't look good in stripes.
Your glasses. Quick, Joe.
Hello, Mr. Farnsworth.
- Hello.
Something strange has happened.
Do any of you know a person by the name of Joe Simpson?
- Simpson?
- Joe Simp... Joe Simpson?
- What an odd name.
- Yeah.
Boy, come in here.
This suit was delivered here to a Joe Simpson.
Nobody else seems to know him either.
Lock it up in the basement dressing room.
Joe Simpson. Of course.
That's Mr. Randolph's tailor.
Sure. This is from Joe Simpson, is it?
We thought you said Joe Simpson.
- Farnsworth.
- What's the matter?
It's half past minutes after 8.
The audience is packed with people.
I know. It's a complete sellout.
A complete sellout.
The standing room is so crowded.
No place to sit down.
Marvelous. Start the overture.
See you later, Eddie.
- Good luck, Randolph.
- Thank you, Mr. Farnsworth.
- Great reception, Dr, Schlenna.
- Naturally.
Intelligent people.
Boys. Boys.
Indians.
Indians.
- Hey, have you got a union card?
- Yeah. Huh?
There he is.
Hello, Hamilton. What's up?
Told the head nurse I might need a few guards.
Violent case, eh?
Paroccipital pressure on the lower brain.
- You know how they get.
- Who's the patient?
A secret. His family wants it kept quiet.
He's a big Hollywood star or something.
Dr. Kirby wants him calm before the operation.
Oh, guy's gone haywire, huh?
I know these schizophrenics.
Hallucinations.
- Keep imagining they're wild people.
- Right, Freddie.
He thought he was a headhunter.
Then he was an Australian bushman...
...and just yesterday, he was a Wild West cowboy. Yippee.
Get the police, quick. Don't let them catch me. They're after me.
What I've been through.
Well, look who's here.
You're safe now.
We'll help you. Won't we, boys?
Sure, positively, Eddie.
Well, what do you know?
Our patient is Eddie Cantor.
I always thought he was a little wacky.
There, my poor man.
Have you been running?
Yes, they've been chasing me and chasing me and chasing me.
Well, sit down.
- Who's been chasing you, Mr. Cantor?
- The Indians.
- Three of them. They're outside.
- See? The Indians are chasing him.
Not only the Indians, but dogs.
Fifty of them. Licking my feet.
Fifty dogs, all licking your feet?
- Yeah, but I fooled them. You know how?
- No, how?
I got off the seesaw and I left them there with the maple syrup.
- He left the dogs with the maple syrup.
- Clever, wasn't he?
- Don't you think so?
- Yes. Yes. Very Clever.
Now, let's take off all our clothes and relax.
No, what are you doing to me?
I didn't come here for this purpose.
I'll see my lawyer about this.
You can't get away with it.
You can't get...
Now, there we are.
Now, don't we feel better?
Well, big chief, let's all go into the teepee and have a nice, quiet powwow.
Now, wait a minute. Teepee? Powwow?
Are you guys crazy?
- Now, be a good little Indian.
- Indian? I'm no Indian. I'm Eddie Cantor.
You know Cantor with the five daughters?
Sure, we know you. Great White Father.
No, wait. Where are you taking me?
You can't do that to me. Where are you going? What are you doing to me?
- Hey, just for...
Get back there.
I don't wanna get back.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, Dinah Shore.
I wish you were coming home now instead of just going away.
I'll miss you so much.
But until we win the war, I guess it's the uniform first and love second.
Yes, darling.
All I can say is what so many other girls are saying today.
I'll be waiting.
And I'll be dreaming of the light in your eyes.
And happy in the thought that when you do come back...
...we'll all be living in a better world.
Not this mixed-up world of 1861.
How sweet you are
How sweet you are
How dear your tenderly smiling face
Through days all bitter and gray and grim
Through nights
When even the stars are dim
How sweet to know
My heart can glow
From just the warmth
Of our first embrace
The world's a lovelier world by far
When I remember
How sweet you are
How sweet you are
How sweet you are
How dear your tenderly smiling face
The world's a lovelier world
By far
When I remember how sweet
You are
That's enough, boys.
All right, Freddie. Here you are, Marty.
Bring him out and hang him up to dry.
All right, guys.
All right, isn't that refreshing?
Come on, upsy-daisy.
Put him down here, boys.
Doesn't that cold water turn him the prettiest shade of blue?
How's he ticking?
According to his pulse, he's been dead for three weeks.
What's my name?
Who launched me?
Be a good man. We're quieting your nerves so Dr. Kirby can operate on you.
Oh, that's only natural.
No surgeon wants to operate on a...
- Operate? Operate on what?
- On your brain, Eddie.
Impossible. If I had brains, what would I be doing here?
Let me out of here. Let me get out.
Take... Take it easy. Take it easy.
Okay, we gotta calm him down.
Give him the vacuum massage.
That'll fix him. That does it every time.
- How much is he getting?
- What's your dial say?
- Fifty.
- Better make it 75.
- Seventy-five.
- Okay.
Good evening, mates. Good evening, good evening and good night to all and sundry.
One over there, my man.
I would like to buy a drink for all the gentlemen in the house.
Hear, hear.
Oh.
I can see the question in your eyes
I can see the twitching of your ears
Now, it's not to be repeated
But, gentlemen, be seated
And I'll tell you where
I've been for all these years
If he's very nicely treated
And we have his toddy heated
He'll tell us where he's been
For all these years
I was out on the blue Pacific
With a cruiser of the fleet
Hopping over the side
For me Saturday dip
Go on, go on
When I noticed a Jap torpedo
Whizzin' by beneath my feet
Comin' lickety-split
And headed for our ship
- Fancy that
- So I stopped her with me left
And I turned her with me right
And I aimed her very careful
And I shoved with all me might
And I sank the sub what sent her
And I roared with righteous wrath
That's what you jolly well get
That's what you jolly well get
Disturbin' me Saturday evenin' bath
Hooray, he's won the war
- He's won the war
- He's won the war
But I'm modest to the core
Hooray, he's won the war
And though he's rather shy
I'm terribly, terribly shy
He will admit he's won the war
Cheerio.
I was captured around Benghazi
By a Nazi regiment
After polishing off
Half a thousand or more
- He's balmy
- And it took them two pairs of tanks
To drag me into the general's tent
Where they started to search
The uniform I wore
- My word
- When they took away my gun
I was pleasant as could be
But then they took a letter
What my sweetheart wrote to me
So I bashed their blooming brains in
And I lived to tell the tale
Well, that's what they jolly well get
That's what they jolly well get
For readin' a gentleman's private mail
Hooray, he's won the war
He's won the war
And I won the one before
Hooray, he's won the war
I hate to tell the tale
But give him a barrel of ale
And he'll admit he's won the war
I was havin' me leave in London
Back in 1941
Havin' breakfast in bed
- At a fancy address
- Oh, yes?
When a Jerry come by
And dropped a bomb
What must've weighed a ton
It was difficult to collect myself, I guess
- I should think
- So to Croydon Field I ran
And I hopped a plane from there
Now, I couldn't tell who'd done it
There were thousands in the air
So I shot down all the blighters
And I told them all, you see
That's what you jolly well get
That's what you jolly well get
For splashin' a gentleman's cup of tea
Hooray, he's saved the day
He's saved the day
In my own quiet way
Hooray, he's saved the day
I always zips me lips
But treat him with fish and chips
And he'll confess he's saved the day
- Hooray
- Hooray
- He's won the war
- He's won the war
- He's won the war
- He's won the war
This mighty conqueror
- Hooray
- Hooray
He's won the war
So to this most heroic gent
We ought to erect a monument
And put it in Trafalgar Square
Where he can enjoy the open air
Hooray
What kind of a place is this?
A place where people come for nervous ailments.
- Don't know of a better place to get one.
- How do you feel now, Mr. Cantor?
Oh, fine. We're having a million laughs.
- Laughs. Gotta get to the theater.
- Wait.
Come back here.
Come back here.
- Go on back there.
- But, fellows, you don't understand.
I've got an opening tonight.
You'll have an opening, as soon as Dr. Kirby gets here.
Dr. Kirby, no.
- Put him on the table.
- No.
You have a kind face, help.
- Will you please help me?
Everything's gonna be lovely.
Now, listen. I'm gonna count up to 10 and if you don't let me go...
- You'll what?
I'll count up to 20.
Get the other room ready.
Oh, nurse, don't you think this is a little bit one-sided?
Now, you just rest easy.
This machine will have you calm in no time.
Calm. Calm.
Say, this isn't bad.
It's just like waltzing with an octopus.
I'll tell Dr. Kirby we're ready for the operation.
Ready? Who's ready? I'm not ready.
No, nurse.
Nurse, you can't do this to me.
Where is that nur...? What is she doing?
No.
Nurse. Doctor. Help. Police.
Oh, you can't... No.
No, wait.
Oh, I wish I was back with the dogs.
- Come back.
- Marty. Fred. Hurry up.
Don't worry, we'll take care of this.
Get up, Eddie.
- What's the matter with you?
- You're the nurse. You tell me.
I know, he's got spontaneous reaction of the sacroiliac.
Too much vibration.
See what happens when you get greedy?
- Of course.
- Don't worry about me, fellas.
I'll be all right. I'll be all right.
All I'll have to do is to go out and get a drop of fresh air.
- I'll be right back.
- Get him, boys.
Come here.
- You see?
- Come back.
- I'm back already.
- We'll give him the pacifier.
- Yeah, give him the chair.
What? No trial? Oh, no.
No, let's... Put me back on the table.
Wasn't that a marvelous number, Harry?
What comes next?
Why, I think it's...
- No, it's Bette Davis.
- Bette Davis? My favorite star.
You marched away and left this town
As empty as can be
And I am like the driftwood
In a deadly calm at sea
I can't sit under the apple tree
With anyone else but me
For there is no secret lover
That the draft board didn't discover
They're either too young or too old
They're either too gray
Or too grassy green
The pickings are poor
And the crop is lean
What's good is in the Army
What's left will never harm me
They're either too old or too young
So, darling, you'll never get stung
Tomorrow I'll go hiking
With that Eagle Scout unless
I get a call from Grandpa
For a snappy game of chess
They're either too warm or too cold
They're either too fast or too fast asleep
So, darling, believe me I'm yours to keep
There isn't any gravy
The gravy's in the Navy
They're either too fresh or too stale
There is no available male
I will confess to one romance
I'm sure you will allow
He tries to serenade me
But his voice is changing now
They're either too bald or too bold
I'm down to the wheelchair and bassinet
My heart just refuses to get upset
I simply can't compel it to
With no Marines to tell it to
I'm either their first breath of spring
Or else I'm their last little fling
I either get a fossil
Or an adolescent pup
I either have to hold him off
Or have to hold him up
The battle is on but the fortress will hold
They're either too young or too old
I'll never, never fail you
When you are in Australia
Or out in the Aleutians
Or off among the Russians
And flying over Egypt
Your heart will never be gypped
And when you get to India
I'll still be what I've been to you
I've looked the field over
And lo and behold
Thanks-
Oh, that looks fine.
Now, turn around a little.
You know, Pat, I'm glad
I gave up my radio career for the theater.
Sure. Your public has a right to see you too.
Yeah, in 20 minutes,
I'll be out on that stage.
I'll knock them dead with my song, then Alexis Smith goes into her dance...
Alexis Smith.
Wasn't she swell in Gentleman Jim?
There she sat at the ringside watching Corbett fight.
He throws a left jab, then follows with a sharp right cross.
Dollies away. And then comes in for another looping left.
- Oh, Joe.
- Oh, Joe.
- I'm all right.
- Sorry, Joe.
Fine. I come here for encouragement.
What do I get?
A sock in the jaw.
My ears are ringing.
- It's the telephone.
- Telephone.
Hello?
Yeah, he's here.
Joe, it's for you.
They said Joe?
I better put on my glasses.
Hello? Yes, Charlie.
- The Indian, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Yes, Charlie, I see. Okay.
- Thanks for calling.
- What'd he say?
Nothing. Cantor escaped.
And they just lost him.
- Cantor escaped?
- Cantor escaped?
Cantor escaped? How? When? You see?
I told you what would happen.
- Let's get out.
- Wait a minute.
If you go, you go alone.
We're staying, aren't we?
What's the sense of getting panicky?
Yeah, to get panicky, you have to have sense.
- Joe.
- Joe.
Ladies and gentlemen, leaving the field of lighter entertainment...
...for just a few moments, we now present a more serious interlude.
It is with genuine pride...
...we bring you three of the screen's foremost dramatic stars.
Miss Olivia de Havilland, Miss Ida Lupino and Mr. George Tobias.

Tha-tha-tha, oh, tha-tha
That's my name
Since you've gone away, away
Guess I'm just a lazy
Too-loo-de riffy
Too-loo-de rizza
- Too-loo-de rizzy, free-don-do

- When my dreamboat comes home
- He dreams of Jeannie
With the light-brown hair
Ain't it a shame? Oh, ain't it a shame?
Oh, ain't it a shame?
Oh, ain't it a shame?
Dreamin' all day, dreamin' all night

Ree-tye-oh

Why change it?
That's my name
Baby
Wanna stay a dreamer till you're home
And wakin' me up, up, up, a once more

All right, boys.
Lift him over and flatten him out.
Don't worry. We're gonna give you gas.
Give me four gallons and check my oil.
Don't be impatient.
Dr. Kirby'll be here in a few minutes.
- Dr. Kirby. Listen.
- Down.
- You don't understand.
- Down.
- This is all a mistake.
- Down.
And don't kick.
I always kick on the fourth down. No!
Well, good evening, everybody.
- Here we go again.
- Good evening, Dr. Kirby.
Good evening.
Well, I've seen all the x-rays.
- Everything ready?
- I wish I was back with Junior...
...maple syrup and all.
Delirious, I see? Ah, my favorite scalpel.
- Who's the patient?
- Eddie Cantor.
Eddie Cantor?
Start the anesthetic.
Doctor, there's been a mistake.
You see, I was kidnapped.
I broke loose, climbed in here for safety.
I am not wacky.
Hold the anesthetic.
This sounds reasonable.
- How did you escape form the kidnappers?
- Easy. I became a wooden Indian.
- Start the anesthetic.
- If you have to operate, go ahead.
But there's one thing I'd like to say.
What's that?
- Help!
Just a minute. What's...?
- What's the trouble?
- I have a bronchial irritation.
- It...
- Do you see spots before your eyes?
- Do you have trouble breathing?
- In, not out.
Just count up to 10, please.
- One, two, three, four...
- Enough. I tell you what you do.
Before you go to bed, drop some butter in milk...
...and you'll feel all right.
- Thanks. How much do I owe?
- That'll be $5.
- Five...? Wait, what is this?
Now, breathe deeply and count to 10.
One...
...two. I wouldn't give you a cent more.
Dr. Kirby, what's going on here?
I'm doing a prefrontal section on Eddie Cantor.
- But this is the patient, doctor.
Oh, we made a mistake.
Mr. Cantor. Oh, Mr. Cantor.
- Come to. Please.
- Have a cigar, fellas.
- My wife just had another boy.
- Oh, Mr. Cantor. Wake up. Wake up.
- We're not going to operate.
- Oh, go on, doc.
- Cut yourself a slice of ham.
- Wake up. Wake up.
He said something about the theater.
The theater? That's it. Get me the police.
- Where's the phone?
- In the hall.
I've gotta get to that theater.
Good luck, buddy.
How do you do?
Tommy, Pat.
- I shouldn't have stayed here.
- I'm on in a minute.
- Cantor isn't here, is he?
- No, but Farnsworth is my pal now.
He said, "Eddie,
Schlenna and I have misjudged you.
You've been very nice.
Sing the star's number. "
- Look, what am I gonna do?
- Well, if he wants you to sing, sing.
"Sing it," she says. What happens if Cantor comes in and finds me singing his song?
Thank you. Thank you.
And now, by way of a surprise, we present Eddie Cantor's protégé...
...Tommy Randolph, who serenades one of our lovely Latin neighbors.
And then as a thrilling climax...
...a dance by that brilliant and exciting star, Alexis Smith.
The lady came from South America
And she was lovely to see
When she arrived in North America
They introduced her to me
And so I showed her the town
And I was such a gallant guide
And when the moon had gone down
I sighed
Good night, good neighbor
This evening with you
Has charmed me so
Tomorrow those Latin eyes aglow
Will haunt me all day
Good night, good neighbor
We're back at your door
And now we kiss
Though down in Brazil
You'd frown at this
You'll soon learn our way
I know you're dreaming of a homeland
So very dear
Land of many charms
But, oh, you'll find another homeland
Right over here
Right over here in my arms
Good night, good neighbor
Though I have no soft guitar to play
Come close to my heart and hear it say
Good neighbor, good night
Good night, good neighbor
Though I have no soft guitar to play
Come close to my heart and hear it say
Good neighbor, good night
Good night, good neighbor
Good neighbor, good night
Good night
- Listen to that applause.
- Terrific. He's the hit of the show.
- It's for you from out front.
- For me?
They liked it.
- You were swell.
I knew you'd make good.
They're still applauding.
- Listen to this.
- Yeah.
"If you will bring young Randolph to the studio Monday morning...
...I'll have a contract waiting for him.
J.L. Warner. "
- You're gonna be a movie star.
- You did it, Tommy. You did it.
You mean we did it.
Our troubles are over.
Now I can sell the bus.
Know what I'm gonna sing in my first picture? "Moondust. "
- Oh, Tommy.
- I think I better keep the bus.
Out of my way.
- What's the matter?
I'm Eddie Cantor, producing the show. The chairman.
- Get out of my way.
Hey, wait a minute.
Let me alone.
He's in here and we're gonna find him.
Come along with me, officer.
Aha. There he is. Officer, arrest that man.
The Indians told me all about you, Randolph.
Quiet. What's the meaning of this?
- This guy claims he's Eddie Cantor.
- I am.
Eddie Cantor has been with me all day.
He's standing in the wings ready to go on.
- Let's get this straight. Who's who?
- I'm who. That's who.
- Somebody better do something.
- What are we gonna do?
Pat, think of something.
If you ever got an idea, get one now.
I've got it. Joe, you're Eddie Cantor. No matter what happens, bluff your way out.
- Right.
- Go on, get out there.
- This is your big scene.
Yeah, but...
Impostor? But I'm Eddie Cantor. That man is a phony. He doesn't even look like me.
Look at that face. Repulsive.
- What do you got to say?
- Me, well...
...to tell you the truth, officer...
- We've never seen this man before.
Positively not.
- Have we, Mr. Cantor?
- Why, you big...
- Hey.
- Say, wait a minute, officer.
Say, there's a girl who can te...
- Dinah? Dinah?
- Eddie, do you realize a show is going on?
That's why I'm here.
- I'm not talking to you.
- You call me?
Dinah, don't you know who I am?
I'm Cantor.
What's the matter?
Who'd ever believe two people could look like that.
You see, officer.
- Shut up.
Dinah, tell them I'm Cantor.
I'll double your salary.
I don't know who you are but if you're doubling my salary, you're not Cantor.
That settles it.
- Is everybody screwy around here?
I don't know. But you called the police station from a sanitarium.
Yeah, I know, officer, but...
Hold it. Olaf. Olaf.
I'll show you who's crazy around here. Olaf.
- You're in on this. I know that.
Please. Please.
- What can I do for you?
- Olaf, he's not your boss. I am.
- Officer, let me tell you. I know...
Take him out.
Just a second. How can you be sure which one of these is Cantor?
That's easy. Just tell a joke.
Joke? You want me to joke at a time like this?
- Then you tell a joke.
- Me?
Go on, Mr. Cantor.
Tell one of your real funny ones.
- Yeah.
- Oh, here's one.
You know why the bartender couldn't serve me a cocktail?
- No, why?
- Because the Manhattan any more.
That's a riot, boss. Great. Great.
That's Mr. Cantor, officer.
Nobody else in the world could tell a stinker like that.
- Olaf, you're through.
- So are you. Come on, Napoleon.
- You, I can kill.
Hey, come here.
That man has no right to do that.
You would hit a man with glasses, wouldn't you?
You hurt?
I'll be in the show...
...if it's the last thing I do. You watch.
Eddie, I can't tell you how sorry I am that...
That music. That's you.
Go on, you're on.
Yeah, wait a minute. What'll I do?
- What'll you do? Go on out there.
- Give them the best imitation of Cantor.
- That's right.
- Okay, here goes.
We're staying home tonight
My baby and me
Having a patriotic time
No ballroom floor the jitterbugs
All pile on
Those jitterbugs are murder
On your nylon
No brush and comb tonight
No people to see
Being alone is so sublime
We bought a big bologna
And though it's hard to take
We'll turn out all the lights
And make-believe it's a steak
We're staying home tonight
Baby and me
Having a patriotic time
How sweet you are
How sweet you are
How dear your tenderly smiling face
- We're way up North
- And still together
- No trips back and forth
- We like the weather
And if you happen to be wondering still
Whatever became of vaudeville
It's way up North
The dreamer, the dreamer
I reckon that's my name
Why change it?
What for?
I wanna stay a dreamer
Till you're home once more
Till you're home
And wakin' me up once more
The dreamer, the dreamer
Ree-tye-oh
So-aw-de-free-dit
I'm a dreamer, aren't we all?
- A- doodily-eh-sue, zay-zo
- A- doodily-eh-sue, zay-zo
Wah-wah
- A- doodily-eh-sue, zay-zo
- A- doodily-eh-sue, zay-zo
Wah-wah
Wah-wah
- A- doodily-eh-sue, zay-zo
- A- doodily-eh-sue, zay-zo
- A- doodily-eh-sue, zay-ugh!
- A- doodily-eh-sue, zay-ugh!
Oh, yes, I know
Every gal in the city, I know
Every gal in the city?
I know every gal in the city
But, oh, they ain't this pretty
I'm riding for a fall
Dudin' up, dudin' up like I wasn't wise
To the gal with the big blue eyes
Love isn't born
That's a bit of old-fashioned corn
Let's call a spade a spade
When you find more than lemon
In your lemonade
You'll know that
Love isn't born, it's made
Oh, that voice is so divine
I'm sorry it isn't mine
Good night, good neighbor
Though I have no soft guitar to play
Come close to my heart and hear it say
Good neighbor, good night
Good night, good neighbor
Good neighbor, good night
You marched away and knew so well
Our love would stay alive
I'm stuck with either sweet 16
Or kids of 65
You must have known it
The day you enrolled
They're either too young or too old
Ice-cold Katie
Won't you marry the soldier?
Ice-cold Katie
You're the talk of the town
Ice-cold Katie
Won't you marry the soldier?
Melt, melt, melt on down
- Ice-cold Katie Brown
- Ice-cold Katie Brown
How's your love life?
Well, thank your lucky stars
Yes, thank your lucky stars
It's doin' fine
Keep your love life
As sweet as candy bars
And thank your lucky stars
Like I thank mine
So thank your lucky stars right now
Thank your lucky stars
Right now
On behalf of your commanding officer...
...I can tell Mr. José lturbi that this ship's officers and crew...
...are grateful to him for coming here to lead our Navy bands.
Along with every other civilian, it is I who am grateful to you.
And to all the men in the US Navy.
The men who are to be decorated are present, sir.
"Joseph Brady, Gunner's Mate,
Second Class.
"Clarence Doolittle, Seaman, First Class.
"During the action aboard the USS Cruiser Knoxville...
"...these men served their gun until the ammunition was exhausted.
"When by force of explosion,
Doolittle was blown overboard...
"...Joseph Brady, without regard for his own personal safety...
"...dived into the sea and rescued his shipmate."
Acting for the Secretary of the Navy,
I award you both the Silver Star.
- Congratulations, Brady.
- Thank you, sir.
- Congratulations, Doolittle.
- Thank you, sir.
To those formerly on the Knoxville, including those just decorated:
You'll have four days leave effective immediately.
Leave your quarters!
The poor little fellows! They gotta stay and mind the ship for the Admiral.
They can't go to Hollywood where beautiful dames grow like oranges.
Where all you got to do is reach out and pick them, right off the street.
- Congratulations, Joe.
- Thanks.
If you visit the studios and see any stars, will you get me their autographs?
Oh, no. After eight months at sea, it won't be autographs I'll wind up with.
- I got plans.
- What kind of plans?
In Hollywood,
I've got a little plan named... Lola.
That Lola, I tell you she's a...
It isn't exactly that. It's a...
No, it isn't that either.
Tell us about it, Joe.
You noticed how different the band sounded with lturbi leading it?
Lola is like that.
In a room with a million beautiful dames, she'd be the one you'd see.
You mean, she's different?
I wouldn't say that. If you like dames, why get one that's different?
No. It's just that whatever the others have, Lola has more of it.
You think she is still waiting?
Dames have been known to wander.
From me? Please, Sailor, leave us not talk mutiny!
Fall in on deck for special leave!
Do you think we can tear ourselves away?
Yeah, but it'll be tough.
"We hate to leave
"We hate to leave
"But when they give you leave
You gotta leave!
"Our hearts bleed for all of you guys aboard
"But right now sympathy's a thing we can't afford!
"We hate to leave
"Without you guys along
We'll grieve and grieve
"But we'll be back
"Yes, we'll be back before we're even missed
"And tell you guys about the countless dames that we have kissed
"Believe us, Mate
"We really hate to leave!"
It's awful for us to leave these guys here in their undershirts.
But we gotta go meet those dames in their soft silk dresses.
Duty is duty! An order is an order!
I know some guys would love meeting a gorgeous gal every night.
"We hate to leave
"When they give you leave
You gotta leave
"No more pinup gals that we so enjoy
"Tonight they're forcing us to meet the real McCoy
"We hate to leave
"But we'll be back before the anchors heave
"We wanna stay, we wanna stay
Our hearts are with the ship
"The Admiral made us take this leave
He beat us with a whip
"Believe us, Mate
"We really...
"...hate to leave!"
But, honey, I saved all of my leave for you!
Why shouldn't I have?
You're the only one anyplace I want to see.
What is he doing wrong?
He's dead, that's all. Watch.
I don't want to meet your boyfriend's ex-girlfriend.
I want to meet you.
Well, you'll be sorry!
"You'll be sorry!"
Hello? Miss LaVerne?
Miss Lola LaVerne?
Is this the face that launched a thousand ships?
Yeah, it's Joe, alright.
Doesn't anybody want coffee?
Well, it'll take me awhile to hit Hollywood.
Can you wait?
I know what you mean, baby.
But you just try.
Well, let's decide that later.
After eight months at sea, all I want to do is just look at you for a long, long time.
C'mon! Eight months is a long enough time to wait!
Hello, you beautiful creature.
When you hear the tone, the time will be 6:10 and one quarter.
Buy War Bonds!
Thank you, I will.
Hey, the buses for Hollywood!
"Anchors Aweigh!"
What's the matter?
Nothing. Why?
Where are you going so late?
To join the Navy.
What?
I said I'm going to join the Navy.
- Wait a minute!
- I'm in a hurry.
Take it easy. Where do you live?
- Why?
- I want to take you home.
I'm not going home.
I've just come from there.
What's your name?
Look, it's my job to help lost boys.
"Lost" means not knowing where you're going. I do know.
I'm going to join the Navy.
If that's what you want, but you'll come to the station with me.
I want to join the Navy, not the police.
Brooklyn!
Are you following me?
What's with you? Come on, spill it!
Well, you see it's like this, Joe.
I've been in the Navy a year and a half.
Every time we hit port and get liberty, all I do is go to the library.
So you like books? What's the beef?
Now I want to try something different, like going out with girls.
- Good luck.
- But I don't know how to begin.
Wait. Don't give me that.
After all, you're no yokel you're from Brooklyn.
Even in Brooklyn things can go wrong.
What do you mean?
Right from boy's high school, I went to the Cathedral of St. John the Divine...
...as assistant choirmaster.
And from there I joined the Navy.
I wouldn't tell that to anyone but you.
Sure, I'll keep it quiet.
Look, you want a couple of phone numbers?
I'd be too scared to use them.
But when you mentioned Lola, I thought...
- Are you kidding?
- It's not what you think!
I thought I could string along and learn.
After all, you're the best wolf in the Navy.
Besides, you gotta help me.
You saved my life and you owe me something.
I saved your life, so now I owe you something?
Have you gone crazy?
I didn't ask you to save my life, but you did.
Now I figure you're responsible for me.
Well, I don't.
What's the sense of having your life saved, if you can't have any fun with it?
Look, I got a lot to do in four days.
I don't want you tailing me.
You say I owe you something.
Well, I don't see it.
If I find you a dame and get you started, will you call it quits?
Let me see...
We'll have to do the best with what you've got.
First, fix your hat.
Let me see a sample of your technique.
You are you, and I'm a dame coming down the street. Pick me up.
I'm a dame coming down the street.
Come on.
I beg your pardon, Miss...
Lady, could I possibly...
Give it more pep.
When you're hunting it's how you feel that counts.
If you feel like a mouse you'll get only cheese.
But if you feel like a wolf, nothing can go wrong. You're in control.
One of you has to come with me to the station. Any choice? You'll do.
- Please, let's not have any unpleasantness.
- I'll go with you, Joe.
How can this happen to me just when I'm beginning to feel like a wolf?
The Secretary of the Navy and Washington will hear about this!
Who's in charge around here?
Are you the guy who had me pulled in?
- Pardon me for not getting up.
- What's the charge?
If you've been inconvenienced, I'm sorry.
This young man wants to join the Navy.
We want him to go home.
He won't tell us where he lives...
...but he might tell a sailor.
You want to join the Navy, huh?
Aye-aye, sir.
Attention!
- Name?
- Donald Martin, sir.
- Where do you live?
- 1515 Foothill Road.
My daddy was in the Navy and he said when I was grown up I could join.
And now I am grown up, so I want to.
Sure, Mate, but...
There's a rule in the Navy.
You gotta have a letter from your mother or father saying it's okay.
But I don't have a mother or father anymore.
I live with my Aunt Susie.
Would a letter from an aunt be alright?
Sure. Why don't you talk to her about it?
One of these guys will take you home.
You!
Gotta even be a nursemaid...
Aunt Susie may not give me the letter, but if you asked her...
- You better come, too.
- I can't.
What will I do about Lola?
I guess Aunt Susie must be asleep, huh?
She isn't home yet.
I suppose the door is locked, too.
- But we can get in.
- How?
The way I got out.
Look out for my wagon.
"Dear Miss Abbott:
Donald was a very good boy.
"He is fast asleep, so I went home.
Mrs. Murphy."
I know where my aunt hides the candy.
Wait, will she return soon?
Oh, sure.
"Oh, sure?" How do you know?
Well, she lives here.
Sometimes he talks like you.
I don't want you to think
I'd walk out on you.
But you gotta stay with the kid anyhow...
I got a date with a girl.
That's great! That's dandy!
He's got a date with a girl!
Does he think I have a date with a duck?
Goodbye!
Brooklyn, I'm blowing.
The baby is all yours.
But what about my being a wolf?
You promised me.
You promised me you'd talk to Aunt Susie.
If you don't help me, what will I do?
What will become of me?
Who is he calling?
A girl.
Forgotten you?
Honey, with the picture of you
I've got in my mind?
Why, even across the phone
I can see every...
Look, this is what happened.
I found a kid that was lost...
Joe, I wasn't lost!
I had to take him home. I won't be long.
As long as I get there?
Honey, you know I'll get there.
Look, we better discuss that later, huh?
What are you going to discuss later?
Things. You'll understand when you get older.
Everybody keeps saying that to me.
They used to say that to me, too.
Well, did you understand when you got older?
No.
What can an old aunt be doing out this late?
Susan, don't you wish that you were up there?
I've never heard his voice sound so beautiful.
Iturbi gets so much from a singer.
I'd give anything to work with him.
Cut it! Print that.
Okay, children. You can go home now, and thanks very much.
- How was it for camera?
- Right on the nose.
When will we shoot the boogie-woogie?
Hi, Aunt Susie.
What got you home so early?
Your feet give out?
What?
Dames like you kill me. Don't you ever think of anybody but yourself?
Leaving a little kid alone while you're out having a big time.
Would you mind telling me who you are and why you're here?
Just a guy the police called in when they found this kid wandering around.
Of course, that wouldn't interest you.
So if you'd just step aside...
Don't apologize, just clear the deck!
Come on, Brooklyn.
Hey, Joe, the kid is crying.
Well, if I had to live with a dame like that,
I'd cry, too.
I thought she was nice.
A dame who leaves a kid alone ain't nice.
Wait, please. Give me a chance.
Donald explained...
Okay. You're very sorry.
But we have plans, and we want to get going.
Oh, I haven't any plans.
I thought if you didn't mind you could come back for a while.
Donald is so upset.
It's way past his bedtime.
Sure. We didn't even say goodbye.
Something wrong, Joe?
I thought you'd gone!
- Hey, Sailor, what's with you?
- You forgot about me...
...about what you promised!
You know, the letter!
Well, he wanted to join the Navy.
But I told him about the rule.
The rule about needing a letter from your folks saying it's okay.
And Donald wanted Joe to ask you for it.
Suppose we talk about that in the morning?
If you give it to me now,
I can go right with Joe.
You want me to go with you, don't you?
Well, sure, kid.
But you need other things besides the letter.
Can you read and write?
No, he can't. He plays hooky all the time.
You can't? Do you think the Navy takes dopes?
Not ever?
Sometimes, but even the dopes have to be able to read and write.
No, I'm sorry, kid, it's just no soap.
Joe, now what will I do?
Well, first you gotta go to school and study real hard.
Before you know it, you won't be a dope.
Now, how about going to bed?
I want Joe to put me to bed.
Donald, we can't keep these gentlemen.
They have things to do.
No, they haven't. They're on leave.
We'd be very happy to put him to bed, wouldn't we, Joe?
Thank you, but you've done enough already.
Okay, but no stalling!
Come on, you helper, you!
Hit the sack, Sailor.
Joe! You're coming back to see me.
Promise?
Sure. That's a deal.
All set?
No, I always get sung to sleep.
Look who wants to join the Navy!
Hey, do you think they sing us sailors to sleep?
But I'm not in the Navy yet, so it's alright for me to be sung to.
Where he's right, he's right.
You sing to him. After all, you're the choirmaster around here.
I told you that in the strictest of confidence.
You promised never to bring it up.
"Lullaby
"And good night
"With roses bedight
"Bright angels around
"My darling shall stand!
"Lay thee down now and rest
"May thy slumber be blessed"
- They're asleep.
- Your friend, too?
Well, I made some coffee.
You shouldn't have.
I mean, it's swell, but...
It's nothing.
Is something wrong?
Did you have a nice nap?
- But I have coffee and sandwiches.
- Sorry, we gotta blow.
I have to tell you something, and you won't like it.
Remember you were going to get me a girl?
I've seen the one I want.
But you promised me.
Okay, I promised you!
But I didn't promise you Aunt Susie!
Good night.
But, Lola, it's not that late!
Baby, I know you're tired, but...
What do you mean, it's for my sake?
Well, honey, I wouldn't be disappointed in you.
I couldn't be.
No, no, no, I'm not sore.
I'll be by tomorrow.
Well, alright, if that's what you want.
That's tough.
Hurry up.
- What's the Navy coming to?
- I ask myself that.
I don't want to keep messing up your plans.
We won't have to look for a girl for me.
We've already found Aunt Susan.
Listen, I didn't save your life for that character!
I'll get you a dame that's a dame.
Right now we got to find a place to sleep, so relax.
Shut up!
A couple of empties down there, fellas.
First night's leave?
Do you want to talk?
We ran into trouble with some kid.
And what a kid!
What another kid she had waiting for us when we got home.
Such trouble we should run into every night of our life, huh?
Oh, boy, what a town this is!
How do you like that? I walk my feet off all night and end up with a glass of beer.
You don't live right.
Never in all my life have I seen such dames!
This blonde... Not that there was anything wrong with your redhead...
She was rather interesting.
"Interesting!"
You should have seen the kid work.
I'll tell you, we took the dames home.
A little slow at first...
I asked my girl for a kiss.
She said, "No."
We want the details. What happened?
I'll tell you.
"I begged her"
That's the way he started.
"I pleaded"
You should have seen him.
"I told her, 'Baby, come out of your shell'
"I told her, 'Maybe, you'll find that it's swell"'
What technique!
"I argued!"
I never saw such a stubborn dame!
"I threatened!"
And he's got muscles, too.
"I said, 'You can't send me home
Not like this'
"And I finally got that kiss"
Tell them, Brooklyn.
"She begged me"
True.
"She pleaded"
Got down on bended knee!
"She told me, 'Baby, come out of your shell"'
He was sensational!
"She told me, 'Maybe, you'll find that it's swell"'
Tell them, Brooklyn.
"She argued"
Fought like a wildcat.
"She threatened"
Practically drew a gun on the boy.
"She said, 'You can't send me home
Not like this."'
What happened?
"She finally got her kiss!"
What a time we had tonight.
What a dish! What a dream!
What a dame!
And she lives alone!
What time is it?
It's early.
What time is it?
What happened to that clock?
The phone! Where is it?
Hello? Hello, Lola, honey...
Then who is it?
Well, this is Joe Brady. Where is Lola?
Did she leave a message for me?
Never mind what you'd say!
What did Lola say?
Well, that's too bad about you, too!
Hey, don't hang up on me!
Leave a note. Tell her I'll call later!
Honest, Joe, I can explain everything!
You were sleeping like a baby!
I know you needed a rest badly!
Help!
It's against the rules, but we thought we'd serve you breakfast up here.
After all, you've been through so much.
You must appreciate a buddy like Clarence.
Do you know he wouldn't let anyone make a sound all morning?
We crept around like little mice so as not to wake you. I never saw such devotion!
Don't think I don't appreciate it.
And don't think I won't pay him back.
- I'm sure Clarence doesn't expect it.
- No, really, I don't. I'd hate it.
You poor boy.
Forty-eight days and nights on a raft!
If you want any more coffee just let us know.
- He looks so shy.
- He's so sweet.
Joe, you ought to eat this food.
It gets cold very quickly.
Try the eggs, they're very good.
I left you a razor in the shower, and there's a towel...
You can wait on me hand and foot!
You can polish my shoes and be my slave!
But, Clarence, it won't do you any good.
Because I'm not going to help you with Aunt Susan!
Joe, it isn't Aunt Susan, it's Donald.
You promised him you'd go back to see him.
Why, it's like breaking the word of honor of the whole United States Navy!
I'm not going back to that house!
Look, I get you a date with her, and I don't owe you a thing, right?
Here, take all this stuff.
You'll make an impression.
Let me look at you.
Well, it will have to do.
Now, try, will you?
Won't you come in?
We promised Donald we'd come back, and Brooklyn got him all those toys.
That's awfully kind of you.
Let's put them over here.
Where is he hiding?
Donald? He's still in school.
Thanks to you, he went almost willingly.
Say, aren't you a little young to be bringing up a kid all by yourself?
Well, I'm all the family he has.
His mother died when he was a baby and then his father.
His father left us this house, and that helps quite a lot.
I work and that keeps me from being with Donald as much as I'd like.
I never know when the studio will call me.
Gee, are you an actress?
I want to be a singer. But right now
I'm doing extra work in the movies.
You ever do any singing?
But there are some really great musicians.
There's Stokowski and lturbi and people like that who work in pictures.
There's the chance I might get to sing for one of them.
Any luck so far?
That's awful.
That's terrible.
Thank you, Clarence.
I didn't realize it was so late.
Please forgive me, but I really should run up and dress now.
I'm sorry you missed Donald.
He'll be disappointed.
We didn't come just to see Donald, we...
I'm going to tell her whether you like it or not.
Clarence didn't sleep all night.
Do you know why?
Because he was thinking about you.
I told him you'd understand...
...how it is getting into a strange town when you've been away at sea.
"She'll understand how important it is,"
I told him...
Clarence, do you want to take me out?
Is that what all this means?
- She's a girl with a heart...
- Well, I'd love to.
Honest?
I wish I could make it tonight, but I'm busy.
Boyfriend?
Oh, no, just someone I met at the studio.
He should be here now, so I have to run up and dress.
But you meant what you said about calling you?
Of course. Any night you're free, ring me.
Goodbye and thank you again for Donald.
You know, she's not so bad.
Gee, I'm glad you like her.
I didn't say I like her.
I said she wasn't bad.
Yeah, but coming from you...
Well, if Aunt Susie likes him, he must be okay.
That's a nice car, isn't it?
Hey, aren't you even worried?
Once he takes her out, she'll laugh at any place that we...
That you could take her to.
This means nothing to me.
I'm telling you for your own good.
Once she goes out with him, you're dead.
- You think so?
- Sure.
There's nothing I can do about it.
Brooklyn, there's always something you can do about everything. Come on.
Did you want to see Miss Abbott?
She is dressing. I'll call her.
I wouldn't do that.
Susie hates to be bothered when she's dressing.
Yeah, she hates it.
Something wrong, Jack?
No. Nothing at all.
Then squat someplace, Jack, you're making me nervous.
My name is Bertram Kraler.
Are you good friends of Miss Abbott?
You might call it that.
Are you?
We just met. I'm taking her to dinner.
Maybe you know what you're doing, but I don't think the boys will like it.
I beg your pardon? The boys?
The Navy isn't going to like
Susie branching out this way.
Miss Abbott knows a great many Navy men?
Maybe some she doesn't know.
Say, a dozen or two?
You get aboard a new ship, you don't know a soul.
You're lonesome.
Then at chow somebody says,
"Anybody seen Susie lately?"
Right away everybody is talking about her.
It's kind of homey, if you see what I mean.
Yes, I do.
But, well, she seemed such a quiet girl.
That's not what the song says.
When they sing about her, they never mention the word "quiet."
The Navy has a song about her?
I don't believe it.
Alright, let me hear it.
I don't think so, Bertram.
It's strictly for sailors.
- Yeah, it's not your type of a song.
- I insist.
- Alright, if he insists, let's play it.
- I don't think we ought to.
- Play that "Susie" song.
- You start and I'll find you a key.
"If you knew Susie
Like we know Susie
"Oh, what a gal!
"She's not so choosy
No, not our Susie
"Susie is a lollapaloozie
"When Susie kisses
"It never fails
"When Susie kisses
She takes the wind right out of your sails
"So in conclusion
"Beware of Susan
"Oh, what a gal!
"'S' is for sincerity
"Which she's got none of
"'U' is for
"You know what I mean
"'S' is for
"Sincerity
"Which she's got none of
"'I' is for the Irish in her smile
"Her Irish smile
"'E' is for
"Her eagerness to please us
"That is how she won her Navy 'E'!
"Put them all together
"They spell 'Susie'
"The sweetheart of the boys at sea!
"Oh, that Susie
She's a doozie
- "She's not choosy
- You won't loose-y
- "Don't care who's he
- I mean you-sy
"You'll get woozy
After just one date with Susie
"When you take her home about 10:00
"Another garb is waiting there
To take our Susie out again
- "So, in conclusie
- Beware of Susie
- "She belongs to you and you and me
- And the US Navy"
I don't know what's wrong with him, do you, Brooklyn?
Yes. And I wish I didn't.
Will you tell Miss Abbott, I regret...
Regret what?
What's the matter?
What are you two doing here?
You regret what?
I fear there has been a misunderstanding.
Knowing your tastes, the kind of evening
I planned wouldn't interest you.
What did you say to him?
What's the difference?
I'd like to know what you said to him.
I figured you were stuck with him.
It wasn't Brooklyn, it was me.
Why should you think
I was stuck with him?
I thought you'd be glad to get rid of him.
That you'd be grateful.
You thought I'd be grateful.
Yes.
If I were a dame...
Suppose you were a dame, and for a year you'd been trying to get someplace?
Finally you met a man whose mother was in the philharmonic society...
...who could introduce you to important people like lturbi?
I think it's the meanest and the cruelest...
Don't cry.
Please, don't cry.
Go away.
I'm sorry. I had no right to brush Bertram off without your okay.
Honest, I'm sorry. Please don't cry.
I know you didn't mean it.
But I might never get another chance.
We've got a better chance for you.
That is, Clarence has.
- It's a surprise.
- Well, what kind of a surprise?
He won't tell you. That's Clarence all over.
Do you know what he did before the Navy?
He was the assistant...
Joe, remember your promise!
I can tell her you were in music, can't I?
He was a big shot, too.
Only today he said, "I wonder if meeting lturbi would do her any good.
"After all, he's a friend of mine."
He is?
They're pals.
I once even heard lturbi say:
"It is I who should be grateful to you, Clarence."
Remember, at San Diego?
Do you know what he did?
He called his pal lturbi...
...and arranged for you to have an audition.
Clarence, you didn't!
When? When did he say?
Tell her when.
Saturday. Saturday morning at 11:15.
I'm sorry. It's the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for me.
What did he say?
What did you tell him about me?
Look, I've got an idea...
Clarence has so many things to tell you, why don't you have dinner together?
That would be a wonderful idea!
- You come, too.
- Please do.
You haven't got a thing to do until 10:00, remember?
You came!
You've been in school all this time?
I stayed to tell the teacher what I had to study for the Navy.
She sure doesn't know much.
You kept the teacher until now?
I am taking you to Mrs. Murphy's.
We're going out.
- I'll come, too.
- No, you won't.
But I gotta talk to Joe.
You can talk to Joe some other time.
- When? Tomorrow?
- Sure.
Will you come to school to see me?
- Aunt Susie is coming tomorrow.
- Okay. It's a promise.
Hey, you dope!
You wanted to be alone with her.
Why drag me along?
Because I don't know what lturbi said to me on the phone.
It's a wishing well. Every time I pass by,
I always toss a coin in and make a wish.
Thanks to you I got my wish.
Oh, but should I still toss a coin in?
You better play it safe.
Now it's your turn.
No. My theory is:
"Wishing don't make it so."
You decide what you want, then go out and get it.
Oh, no! Not again! Enchiladas!
What else? Enchiladas for three and all the trimmings.
Now, listen, gentlemen, this is on me.
- You can't spend your money on us.
- I'm not going to.
- Will you wash the dishes?
- Polish silver?
Scrub the floors?
That sounds reasonable.
Now, you stay right here, and no matter what happens, be brave.
- You're set, I'm going to blow.
- You can't leave!
How will you ever get to know her?
Besides, I want to phone Lola.
We have Miss Susan Abbott to sing for you.
"Jealousy!
"You constantly torture me
"I sometimes wonder
"If this spell that I'm under
"Can only be a melody
"For I know no one but me
"Has won your heart
"But when the music starts
"My peace departs
"From the moment they play
"That languorous strain
"And we surrender to all
"lts charm once again
"This jealousy
"That tortures me
"Is ecstasy!
"Mysterious pain
"We danced to a tango of love
"Your heart beats with mine as we sway
"Your eyes give the answer
I'm dreaming of
"That soft word your cruel lips will never say
"I fear that the music will end
"And shatter the spell in the end
"You make me believe
"When your eyes just deceive
"And it's only the tango you love"
- Where's the phone?
- Right up here.
Gee, I thought you were wonderful.
Joe went to make a phone call.
He's a busy guy.
He is the biggest wolf in the Navy.
They call him the sea wolf.
That's what they call him.
Clarence, do you realize that I don't know anything about you?
Other than that you're very nice.
Tell me about yourself.
I'm fine.
Well, what sort of work do you do in the Navy?
Gun crew.
Is it interesting?
Keen.
We missed you.
Susie, it was not bad this time, it was great.
Juan, I have wonderful news.
Guess for whom I'm going to sing on Saturday at 11:15? José lturbi.
The José lturbi.
Clarence is one of his best friends, and he arranged it for me.
Wait! I must tell Mama! I must tell Pedro!
I must tell everybody!
It's only an audition.
It'll be all over the street in five minutes.
Susan, should you tell people?
You have a wonderful voice but...
Yeah, what if everything didn't go just right?
You've given me the opportunity and I want everyone to know about it.
If I fail, it's right they should know that, too.
I guess she's right.
Say, Clarence, why don't you dance with Susan?
Do you want to? I mean,
I'd like to, if you'd like to.
I'd love to.
I only know how to waltz.
That's too bad.
Maybe they'll play one later on.
You know, you two are a strange team.
Clarence is so shy and you're so...
Well, you're a sea wolf,
Clarence told me you were.
Well, dames are crazy about him.
Nice dames, that is.
And not about you? Nice dames, that is?
I'm altogether a different kind of a guy.
I'm never serious about things.
But, Clarence, he's always on the level.
Alright. I know I should have tried, but I didn't.
Okay, so I'm a coward.
I don't know why, you tell me.
Gee whiz, why do I freeze when she looks at me?
What makes people act this way about people?
What makes anything?
"What makes the sun set?
"What makes the moon rise?
"What makes the tide remember to hide?
"And why does it soon rise?
"What makes a star fall?
"Where does it fall to?
"Why does its flight
Make a stop in the night?
"And wish as we all do?
"And what holds a cloud together?
"What makes the sky so blue?
"What makes the sun set?
"What makes the moon rise?
"Is it my love for you?
"And what holds a cloud together?
"And what makes the sky so blue?
"What makes the sun set?
"What makes the moon rise?
"Is it my love for you?"
Gee, you sing just like a bird.
Brooklyn!
Yeah! How did you know?
Flatbush!
Go on! Greenpert!
How do you like that!
Imagine meeting a dame all the way from Brooklyn!
"Ain't it a small world," like my old lady used to say.
Hey, mister, you better sit down.
The manager.
Gee, are you all alone?
No. I'm here with a girl. She's dancing.
Oh, he's my best friend.
Okay. Maybe you know what you're doing.
She's a swell one, that girl, and what a voice.
Yeah, she's wonderful.
She's just about the loveliest...
But you know something?
I can't talk to her.
I can't talk to girls at all.
I never know what to say.
What's wrong with you?
You're talking to me, ain't you?
You're different. You're from Brooklyn.
Most girls are so easy to figure out.
They are?
But you...
One time you look as if you knew all the answers.
And ten minutes later you're just like a little kid.
Just when a guy starts thinking he ought to buy you a doll or an ice-cream cone...
...suddenly you're all grown up again.
I am?
And everything gets all... kind of mixed up and interesting.
I mean, well, that's what Clarence said about you.
He thinks about you all the time.
He does?
Yeah, all the time.
I'll see you tomorrow night?
At the restaurant?
If you don't mind going back there.
I don't mind. It's a swell place.
It has been a lovely evening.
I don't know when I've been so happy.
Good night.
Joe, did you hear what she said?
She has never been so happy.
And if you stop to think for a minute, maybe you'll figure out why.
You mean, lturbi?
Why shouldn't she be happy with that beautiful audition you fixed up?
"All of a sudden my heart sings
"When I remember little things
"The way you dance and hold me tight
"The way you kiss and say 'Good night'
"The crazy things we say and do
"The fun it is to be with you
"The magic thrill that's in your touch
"Oh, darling, I love you so much!
"The secret way you press my hand
"To let me know you understand
"The wind and rain upon your face
"The breathless world of your embrace
"Your little laugh and half-surprise
"The starlight gleaming in your eyes
"Remembering all those little things
"All of a sudden my heart sings"
You have to have a pass to get in, Sailor.
- Does Mr. Iturbi work here?
- Yes.
- I'd kind of like to see him.
- Is Mr. Iturbi expecting you?
- Not exactly.
- I'm sorry but it's impossible.
Look, I gotta talk to him.
It's very important, just for a minute.
There's nothing I can do.
He's very busy, he's recording.
Gentlemen, bar 95, please.
Rolling, Jim.
Stage!
So the Admiral went up on deck and said:
"Gunner's Mate, Joe Brady, what do you think we should do?"
Joe said, "Well, sir..."
'Cause even in a battle, if you talk to an admiral you have to say, "Sir."
C'mon, kids. It's Joe!
- I was just telling them about you!
- Yeah, so I heard!
Where's Aunt Susie?
At the studio.
I'd told them you'd tell us all about your adventures.
Tell us how you got your medal.
Alright, I'll tell you how I got my medal.
Now, close your eyes.
Try to imagine the most beautiful day you've ever seen!
With green grass, singing birds and a shining sun.
- Can you see it?
- Yeah!
Now imagine me walking along playing a tin whistle, as happy as can be.
- Do you see me?
- Yeah!
In those days we wore white suits...
...with blue stripes...
...and a white hat with a little red ball on top.
I was so happy that I ran andjumped and leaped and played.
Just for the fun of it.
I felt good!
Oh, it was such a wonderful, wonderful day.
Suddenly, I slipped into a big hole...
...and fell right to the bottom of it.
I seemed to be in a long tunnel.
Way ahead I could see light, so I started towards it.
Finally, I reached the end and found myself in a strange land.
It looked, well, it lookedjust like a page out of a story book.
And everything was hushed and still.
Like your room at night, after you've gone to sleep.
Hello?
Is anybody here?
No music?
I can't sing if I want to?
Can I dance?
It's a law! It's a law!
It's a terrible law.
"I'll sing and dance when ever I will
No law on earth can keep me still"
Young man, there is such a law.
Our king forbids us to sing and dance.
Wait!
Where dwells this monster of a king whose people may not dance and sing?
In yonder castle, but none can reach him.
"Trust in me, my honored friend,
I'll bring your sadness to an end."
Who are you? What are you doing here?
Just a sailor, visiting you.
- Why are you sad?
- I'm not sad.
- Yes, you are.
- I'm not!
You are!
I'm lonesome.
You deserve to be lonesome.
Lonesome is too good for you.
Passing a law forbidding singing and dancing! Aren't you ashamed?
- I had to.
- What do you mean?
A king has gotta do everything his subjects do, only better.
Well, I can't sing and I can't dance so there had to be a law.
You can so sing and dance. Anybody can.
Well, not anybody that's cranky and gloomy and grumpy.
But anybody whose heart is big and warm and happy, they can.
Try it! Just for a minute, try being happy.
"If you worry, if you worry
If you bother your head"
I do!
"It won't help you, it won't help you
It will hurt you instead!"
It will?
"Grouchers, groaners, cranks and moaners
They're so unfair!"
I know!
"If you can't be gay and merry
Lock yourself in solitary!
"Though it hurts you, though it hurts you
Be a pleasanter guy!
"You may even learn to like it
If you give it a try!"
I'll try!
"You could laugh and sing and dance
As gaily as an elf, but
"Don't expect to get much help
If you don't help yourself!"
- Will you try?
- If you show me.
- I'll show you.
- I'll try.
- You see?
- It's easy.
Look at me! I'm dancing!
What a beautiful story!
And that's how I got my medal.
Recess is over.
What would you like most for a present?
Don't tell Aunt Susie I told you because it's a secret.
She said that you and Clarence fixed it up with a man for her to get a new job.
She's going to make lots of money and buy us all wonderful presents.
What would you rather have than anything?
Well, I'll think it over and let you know.
Don't tell Aunt Susie I told you.
No, I won't.
Joe! Am I glad to see you!
What about you? I got a feeling you didn't get in to see lturbi.
We're sunk! I can't get through that gate!
What do you mean, you can't?
Joe, I've tried and tried but it's no use.
You have to have an appointment!
My name is Joe Brady.
I'd like to see José lturbi.
- Is he expecting you?
- Yes.
- I'll let you talk to his secretary.
- Thank you.
Hello, Jean.
A Mr. Brady from the US Navy to see Mr. Iturbi.
When I watch you I get a feeling that there's something wrong with me.
Brooklyn, you just gotta learn not to get scared.
Hey! I got a pass, Brooklyn! I got a pass!
- I guess everybody's out.
- Okay, let's go.
Can you tell me where Mr. Iturbi's office is?
Sure. Right over there.
Mr. Brady?
I expect Mr. Iturbi at any moment.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thanks.
- Have you been at sea recently?
- Yeah, I'm on leave.
I suppose you're having a wonderful time.
I'm Susan Abbott.
Someone made an appointment for me to audition for Mr. Iturbi this Saturday...
Ever speak to sailors, lady?
Hello, Joe. What are you doing here?
Clarence is busy talking with José.
I was waiting for him.
We can go out and have a Coke.
Miss Abbott, I'm afraid Mr. Iturbi...
Jean, tell Mr. Iturbi she'll be back next Saturday.
I'll be back. Tell him to wait for me.
Susie, you almost made a terrible mistake!
I just wanted to ask Mr. Iturbi what song
I should prepare for the audition.
Just what I thought you wanted.
Am I glad I was there to stop you!
Believe me, Aunt Susie.
Take my word for it.
You shouldn't go near him until the minute you're ready to audition.
Why?
If you see him now and try to talk to him, he's polite but he's busy. It's no good.
If you wait until Saturday at 11:15...
He's expecting a big, beefy character.
Instead, you walk in, you're all dressed up.
You look like a million dollars.
Aunt Susie, believe me, you'll kill him!
Come on. I owe you a Coke.
You're sort of Clarence's guardian angel, too, aren't you?
Well, you're always with him or talking about him.
Why?
I figured he needed a girl.
Clarence didn't want just any girl.
He wanted somebody he could think about and write to.
And come home to.
I guess he found her, huh?
What about you? What do you want?
- What kind of girl do you like?
- Why?
I'm just curious.
Well, the kind of girl I like is a very definite kind of a girl.
For example, the girl I know here in LA...
You mean, Lola?
Well, yeah, take her.
Nothing serious about her.
Nothing serious. Strictly for laughs.
If she sees you, great.
If she doesn't, she'll find someone else.
She doesn't tie you down.
I see. You don't want to be tied down, do you?
That's for guys like Clarence. Nice guys.
What I like is...
Yes, what do you like?
I don't know, Aunt Susie. Right now,
I'm a little confused about what I like.
- I have a feeling that everything is...
- Yes?
Back on the set, kids. Come on, Susie.
Everybody works in the next shot.
Joe, why don't you come to the cafe tonight?
You could bring your girl.
Maybe Clarence wants to see you alone.
Call the committee and tell them
I'll be at the camp.
But, Mr. Iturbi, you have be at the studio!
How will you get to the camp?
I'll make it. Tell them not to expect me until the last minute.
Remember, later you have an appointment with Carlos.
Yes, I'll be there. I'll be there on time.
Please, stop worrying.
Give me the Tchaikovsky Concerto and get yourself a chocolate sundae.
- Your next appointment...
- With walnuts.
- How are you?
- Oh, fine.
You tune pianos or play them?
A little of both.
Hey, I know that song.
"Tonight we love
"While the moon beams down in dreamland tonight
"We touched the stars
Love was ours..."
Sure, I like that!
You like Tchaikovsky, huh?
Tchaikovsky, the composer.
You must be mistaken.
Freddy Martin wrote that.
I've heard it on the radio a thousand times.
Well, those fellows... they steal from each other.
"I forgot the words..."
- That's nice.
- I'm glad you liked it.
If I were you, I'd quit this piano tuning.
There's no future in it.
- You play very well.
- Thank you. It's nice to be encouraged.
- You sing pretty good yourself.
- Thank you.
Well, I got to go now.
I have a few more pianos to tune.
Goodbye, Sailor. Thanks again.
Keep plugging.
Señor Clarence! Friend of Susita!
The whole street is talking of what you're doing for our Susita!
- I got a date with her.
- How happy she will be to see you!
Sit down. Make yourself comfortable.
I must rush and tell her you are here.
Señor lturbi, he is well, yes?
He's well.
Well, look who's here!
And looking like he is at a wake!
Yeah, I got a date with Susan.
Don't you like her?
Sure I like her. I think she's wonderful.
Only, I'll be all alone with her, and I'll sit here like a dope.
I won't know what to say!
What are you worrying about?
The first note I heard you sing...
...I knew you were a romantic fella.
You think I can just walk up to her and start singing?
Of course you don't just walk up to her and start singing. Look...
I'm her.
I'm just finishing dinner.
I'm toying with my coffee.
The fellows are beating their brains out playing soft music.
I'm looking at you.
You're looking at me.
Okay. Take it.
Gee, you're swell!
Gee, thanks.
That's right. That's the way.
"The charm of you is comparable to
"A Christmas tree with toys
"With little girls and boys
"When first they see the tree
"The thrill of you is comparable to
"The thrill I felt when I
"First learned a heart could sigh
"And you were the reason why
"And yet, and yet
"If we two had never met
"I'd know your grace
"That warmth of face
"That only the angels get
"And so comparing you
"With all of these things
"Is all that I can do
"Because they add up to
"The charm of you!"
I'd give a month's tips to have somebody sing those words to me.
Somebody will, Brooklyn.
Some girls, when a fellow visits her, he brings flowers. Orchids even.
I'm the other type.
Me, a fellow brings four bottles of beer.
Why kid myself?
Why are you talking yourself down?
You're a terrific girl!
I better get to work.
Hello, Clarence.
I hope you haven't been waiting long.
- What did you say?
- I didn't say anything.
Did you enjoy your visit with Mr. Iturbi?
I saw Joe at the studio and he said you were there.
You know, Clarence, I feel as though
Saturday will never come.
- I can hardly wait!
- That's natural, I guess.
Until it happens, I just can't believe that I'll really be singing for Mr. Iturbi.
Susan, I've got to tell you something.
It might change your feelings about seeing me...
...but I've got to tell you.
Please, Clarence, don't tell me now.
I like you very much but we haven't known each other very long and...
Sometimes it's a mistake to say things too soon.
- Do you think so?
- Yes, I do.
Now I feel better.
I was afraid to tell you anyway.
By the way, where is Joe tonight?
Joe probably has a date with Lola.
He's crazy about her.
I mean, she's crazy about him and he doesn't seem to mind it.
That's just to hold you.
Don't forget I got one wish coming.
Let's keep the whole thing quiet, huh?
You know, Clarence, I can't begin to tell you how grateful I am.
It was really nothing...
But I've waited all my life for a chance like this.
- Oh, mister, I'm so sorry!
- It's alright.
Come up to the kitchen.
You can dry off in front of the oven.
Yes, Clarence, you'd better go ahead.
So, I said to myself:
"Half of the year for 18 years...
"...your feet freeze, your hands chap, your nose gets blue.
"Get smart! Get out of town!"
So here I came to sunny California.
My nose don't get blue anymore, but the rest of me is always blue.
You're homesick.
I guess you're dry.
She's gone.
No kidding.
Don't worry. She's probably in her dressing room changing.
With you around, even with the palm trees...
...this feels like Brooklyn.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
The customers are sitting in the inside, and the waitress, she sits on the outside!
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to see you.
- You having fun?
- Oh, a swell time.
All you needed was a girl.
You'd better get back to her.
What are you doing out here?
Listen, Joe, it's kind of tough.
She's so excited about her audition.
Don't you think I should tell her?
That's what I have to tell you. I thought not getting lturbi might cramp your style...
...so I found out we could see him tomorrow at the Hollywood Bowl.
Don't worry. Everything will be okay with you and Susie.
- Thanks, Joe.
- Yeah.
- Mr. Iturbi is in there?
- Yes, he is.
We're friends of his and we'd like to see him.
Sorry, nobody is allowed in there during rehearsals.
I got a dream I dream all the time:
To have a cop say,
"Glad to see you. Come right in."
- So, we give up?
- We don't give up.
We got him cornered.
Where is lturbi?
He just left, and he's eight minutes late.
Even you can be licked, Joe.
We just tell Susan the truth.
Okay, I'll go.
I'll tell her. It's up to me to do it, not you.
I'll go to the studio and tell her it's all a phony.
She'll be sore, but at me.
I'll tell her how I pulled you into it because you're crazy about her.
What's the use, Joe?
Our leave is practically up anyhow.
So what? Susie's not a girl just for a leave.
She is the kind you come home to.
This will do it!
There's something I've been...
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I'll meet you at that little bar near Susie's at about 6:00.
That way I can tell you how she took it.
Unless you want to come with me.
Are you just going to sit here?
Yeah... I'm tired.
"I fall in love to easily
"I fall in love too fast
"I fall in love too terribly hard
"For love to ever last
"My heart should be well-schooled
"'Cause I've been fooled...
"...in the past
"And still I fall in love too easily
"I fall in love too fast"
Brooklyn, I love you!
No, you love Susie.
I did, but I don't.
It's awful, but I can't help it. I love you.
I don't think it's so terrible.
Yes, it is.
Joe is telling Susie
I want to come home to her...
...but I want to come home to you.
Gee, I got a feeling...
I got a feeling I'm fickle.
You're going to marry me, aren't you?
Before I say for sure...
...there's something I gotta tell you so everything will be on the level.
Whatever happened before we met doesn't count.
But this was after we met.
It was?
You still don't have to tell me.
I wanna. I gotta.
Last night when I dropped the soup on you by accident...
...it was no accident.
I didn't want you to sit with her.
Why, Brooklyn.
That's just the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.
Imagine, you were jealous.
But, honey, you'd better tell your pal to stop fixing it up with Susan.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Because bigamy, I don't believe in.
Can I speak to you for a minute?
What would you like to say?
Perhaps I could tell you.
Clarence is a very fine boy, that I know.
You saved his life, so you owe him something.
You've decided he's right for me.
Does that cover everything?
No, that doesn't come anywhere near it.
I forgot.
You like a very definite type of girl...
...and I'm very definitely not it.
Don't be mad, Aunt Susie.
I'm sorry. What is it, Joe?
Susie, what I want to say...
Well, it's not awfully...
It happens every time I'm with you.
I hear myself saying words...
...that never have anything to do with the things I feel about you.
All I know are the things you say and I don't like them.
Susan, I've never said to you what I really wanted to say...
...because my way of saying it just isn't good enough.
Then there must be some other way.
Sure, there is.
Right out of Romeo and Juliet and The Three Musketeers.
All the books and poems.
Those are the words I want to say.
- But I can't. You'd laugh at me.
- I don't think so.
Well, then I'd laugh at myself.
Words like that don't go with sailor suits and three-day leaves and our world.
They go with the world of cloaks and swords.
If you lived in that house then I could tell you.
But I do live in that house.
If you lived in that house...
...in some other time, you'd be a princess.
And I'd be a bandit chief with a hideout in the hills.
A bandit who had seen the princess once and could never forget her.
Then one night, he'd risk his life to see her again.
Hiding in a shadow here, a patch of darkness there...
You...
Nothing.
It has been a hot day.
Give me a scotch. A double.
Are you used to that stuff?
No, I never touch it.
It cuts down on your wind.
It has been a hot day.
Look, Joe...
No, Clarence! You look.
Sometimes things happen that you can't help, see?
You meet somebody, it doesn't seem like anything and suddenly it is something!
Gee! That's exactly what happened!
Don't I know!
It's wonderful, though.
It could be, but not when you double-cross a pal.
When did you find out, Joe?
Today. But I've had a hunch almost from the beginning!
You did?
It's funny, I didn't. Not for sure.
Not until I kissed her.
Of course, last night when she dropped the soup on me...
...I should have known.
The waitress!
She's a terrible waitress.
You're not sore, Joe?
No, I'm not sore. I forgive you.
Is Susan sore?
No, I wouldn't say she acted sore.
Even when you told her there was no audition?
You mean, you didn't tell her?
What did you tell her? What could you be talking about all this time?
Just things. You know how it is with things.
You're in love with Susan yourself.
You're going to ask her to marry you, aren't you?
When? Before or after she doesn't have her audition?
Iturbi! I gotta get to lturbi!
But where? I don't know where.
Where can he be?
He has to light someplace, sometime!
There must be some place he calls home!
Home!
Can I help you?
We were looking for Mr. Iturbi.
Will he be in this morning?
He gave a concert out of town last night.
When he returns he'll go straight to the studio. Is there any message?
- No. No, thanks.
- Very well.
Gee, that's awful.
What are you going to do, Joe?
Well, I'll go to her house and stop her before she leaves.
Don't let this spoil it for you.
You go see your girl.
You haven't got much time.
I'll meet you at the bus.
Do you want me to go with you?
Joe, I was afraid I wouldn't get to see you again.
I wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.
Aunt Susie isn't home.
She went to the studio.
I've gotta go back to my ship and I may not see Aunt Susan again.
So, will you tell her something for me?
Sure, Joe.
Tell her that...
...I tried awfully hard to make things come out right.
And that I'm awfully sorry that it had to end this way.
You got that?
- Here's your coffee and doughnut.
- Thank you.
Mr. Iturbi, I'm so excited.
Imagine running into you this morning of all mornings!
I do hope I won't disappoint you.
A disappointment? To me?
How silly of me.
You don't even know who I am.
Well, I'm Susan Abbott.
That's nice.
Your friends told you about me...
Clarence and Joe.
And this is going to be quite a day for me.
It looks like quite a day for me, too.
You know, I expected Joe to be with you today.
But I'm glad he isn't.
That would make me too nervous.
You don't know him very well, do you?
Not really well.
You'd love him.
He's really a wonderful person.
He's Clarence's best friend.
He's Clarence's best friend.
And I know Clarence very well, don't I?
You wouldn't be giving me an audition if you didn't.
And when is it going to be, this audition?
It isn't exactly that I didn't remember...
It's that you didn't know anything about it.
There never was really an audition at all.
Mr. Iturbi, I'm terribly sorry.
Joe and Clarence told me that they had arranged for...
What I mean is that...
It's a joke. I can see that now.
Please forgive me.
Wait!
These boys, you like them very much.
Yes?
Especially this Joe?
- Don't you?
- Yes.
To throw away a friend in anger, this is not good.
Perhaps if we talk about this terrible situation...
...perhaps it will turn out to be not so terrible.
"From the heart of a lonely poet
"Came a song for the girl he adored
"Though she tried very hard not to show it
"She was terribly, terribly bored
"But then the poet asked her if she'd like one
"And her eyes shone
"And the moon shone
"And the stars shone
"Above them
"As they waltzed through the evening together
"They were swaying
"To the music of enchanted violins
"He held her and told her he'd love her
"Till the moon faded above her
"As they waltzed though she tried not to show it
"She was certain she'd fallen before
"And her eyes shone
"And the moon shone
"And the stars shone above her
"As they waltzed through the evening together
"They were swaying
"To the music of enchanted violins
"The spell of the waltz was upon them
"And the stardust sprinkled on them
"As they waltzed, though she tried not to show it
"You could see in her eyes a light
"And it shone with the love for the poet
"As they waltzed through the thrill of the night"
Why not write her?
There is nothing to say.
Tell her you're sorry.
She knows I am.
How does she know?
Clarence, will you write to Brooklyn or wash some socks or something?
You boys were looking for me.
What was it about?
It's too late now.
That I can tell. Come, we'll talk it over.
Come on, I haven't got much time.
- What are you doing here?
- Are you complaining, honey?
Joe, you stay right here.
Today I invited myself to your concert.
And because you might be interested,
I requested Admiral Hammond...
...to grant a young artist permission to make her debut here.
Therefore, allow me to introduce a singer...
...discovered by the US Navy:
Miss Susan Abbott.
In about five minutes
I will introduce a young singer...
...discovered by the US Navy.
"Anchors Aweigh, my boys,

You are a pig

Since I came here three months ago there's been an outrageous increase in the numbers of crimes involving theft
It has always been that way
Money and jewels taken from rich tourists,over 100 complaints
128 to be exact
And where does it all go to,inspector?
It all goes into the Casbah,every bit of it
And who would you say was responsible?
Pepe le  Moko
The Casbah district is your
 assignment,inspector
That's correct,Sir,it has been for many years
Have you been in there lately?
I just came from there
Looking for someone?
No I had lunch
Lunch? With whom?
Pepe le Moko
How was it?
Oh,a little too spicy I don't like that kind of food but Pepe likes it
Tell me,Inspector,has it occurred to you since you are a policeman,and Pepe
le Moko is a notorious criminal that perhaps you might had arrested him?
It has never left my mind
Fine then we're making some progress
Within another few months they should be having dinner together
And why didn't you arrest him?
That's very simple,it's easy to arrest him but how to get him out of the
Casbah,somewhat impossible
Impossible?
I'll have him out of there within the next 24  hours
Oh,do you mind telling me how?
I have 1100 policemen
And he has 50000 bodyguards,everybody
 in the Casbah is his friend,your call,Sir

-Yes,commissioner
-Come in
This is Carlo
This is Carlo Ferron,we brought him here
 from Paris to pay a visit to le Moko
This is one friend of Pepe le
Moko he won't forget
Is there anything else you want?
 That's you've not already taken
What else do you have?
For you the door
I'm looking for Pepe le Moko
That's nice,who isn't?
I'm a good friend of his
I just arrived from Paris
You must have heard him speak of me
My name is Carlo
Carlo Ferron
If you such a good friend of his go and find him
Look we spent two years together
 at the Metropole in Paris
I don't mean the hotel I mean the jail
All right
Wait here
Good Morning Pepe
Pepe
Pepe could you come inside for a
 minute we're having a bit of problem
Now will you marry me
Stop it Pepe
What's your problem,Max?
Look,Pepe,we have in our possession one
 of the finest set of silver I've ever seen
This here gentleman is one of the biggest purchaser of
this kind of merchandise in the whole of Algiers
Tell Mr Moko your name
Tell him
My name is Anton Duval
I was mislead, brought here under false pretension
Shut up
We offered him the sole honour of purchasing these beautiful pieces for a very modest sum,Pepe
-And he refuses
-I do,I refuse
-Shut up
-I won't touch the stuff
-Sit down my friend,relax
-Sit down
Now tell me
Why don't you want to buy this merchandise from these channels?
How can I? I myself sold it to the American Consulate
You can sell it to someone else
-What kind of a business man are you?
-I am an honest man
-Sure
-And that's stolen goods
-Are you sure?
-Here take this money and let me go
If I dare say,can't you understand?
We are not here to rob you
We are here to do business with you,fair and square
Then you won't have any complaints to the law when you leave
No complaint
I won't plead the word,
I promise you,please let me go
I've never committed a dishonest act in all my life
-What did you say your name was?
-Duval
-Duval
-Anton Duval
-You have a twin brother?
-Why?
No,you know Maurice many years ago in Paris,there was a man, a bearded man,looks like like him
Joey "the Fancy" they call him
That's funny? You know people always say I look like someone else
One day you run away
Everybody was looking for him
Police,his wife even me
You see he owed me 8000 francs for a necklace job
All right,somebody has going have to buy that silverware
That's right
I can always feel I was forced to do it
Pardon me
Thank you
You know it's remarkable you looked just like him
Only Joey's was bald
-Good Bye Joey
-Good Bye Pepe
-I'll send you the 8000 francs
-Wait a minute,your hat
Here you go
Maestro
Don't worry
Oh Max
Don't you want me to get my share?
-Bye Pepe
-Good Bye fellows and don't retire
Inez
What's the matter?
What are you laughing about?
It's just a joke
Pepe some clown
 just walked into my shop
-Who cares
- I don't like his looks
Throw him out
-Pepe,listen
-I'm listening
-He said he was your friend
-He's a liar
Who's a liar?
-Carlo
-Pepe how are you?
-The Metropole,the metropole
-Five years ago
Brain war,brain war making eyes on the wards
This is Carlo my best little pal, why didn't you tell me he was here?
He didn't act like a friend
You sure protect your running ,Pepe
How about a little kiss for Carlo
No,no she's my girl
Run down to the shop and get out the best wine,we are gonna celebrate
We'll have a party,Paris,Carlo and you
All right,Pepe
Get a match
Congratulations,you've just made Sgt.
Have you a cigarette?
Was it on kind of me Slimane?
No,no,don't let that worry you,Pepe
-I'll still be around,you know
-Good,I don't know what I'll do without you
Why?
All the sites and cards must remain
-Do you know what I like the best?
-No
That ugly face of yours
I'm glad you like it,I don't
It's the only bright spot in the Casbah
If that's your only bright spot,Pepe,
I'm afraid you're in trouble
I am
Yes,it means you're getting tired of the Casbah
Do you think I'll leave?
Yes, I think you will
And when that happens,Pepe
Coffee
Why should I leave?
Because it's a prison
And it's not for five years,it's not for ten it's for life,it's an awfully
 long time,Pepe
I have everything I want here
-Everything?
-Sure
What else could I want?
I don't know,change of scenery maybe
Little excitement,travel,you know, night in Monte Carlo,in Paris
Freedom maybe
You look tired,Slimane
You need a long vacation
A long rest
Can't
Got an idea it's working in here,didn't let me rest
What is it?
You
Monsieur
Slimane
Pepe I have
Cigarettes please
It's all right,don't mind you're among friends
-Who is he?
-This is my friend Carlo from Paris
-we used to work together
-He should be more discrete..
Shouting your name all over the place,now it's all right that you're here where nobody can touch you but I have to go in and out get
-out of the Casbah every day
-I know you have to be careful but not of Carlo
Here's the money from the last haul
-I got rid of everything
-You're quite a man
Except this here
The called idiot,he didn't want to take it he said it doesn't work,well
 it doesn't if you want
Throw it away
-Thank you I'll throw it away later
-Have a drink
Oh Pepe I forgot to tell you
-I have a party Odette's
-So?
Four two men and two women
They came on a yacht,Pepe
Such a yacht
Don't you understand? One of the men has nothing but money and one of the women is covered with diamonds,such diamonds
I'll be right back
Pepe
Things are itching for work
Stay here this is your party
If you don't mind I'd like to go
I do mind
He's going to Odette's
-May I have a light please
-Certainly
-Thank you
-You're very welcome
-Drinks Pepe?
-Thanks
You know some day you're going
 to give my place a bad name
At Odette's
What's the matter,Pepe?
I thought you want your party
I got bored
See you later Slimane
-I hope you're not leaving
-I beg you pardon
Can be dangerous to walk through the Casbah
 this late wearing all those diamonds
Are there thieves in the casbah?
Yes,big thieves
What would you suggest?
I suggest you'd be careful
Well,things are beginning to
 pick up around here
Won't you sit down and tell us more
May I?
Why not? I didn't invite you
Thanks
My husband,Pierre LeClerk,Monsieur
Durand and Mademoiselle Reynaud
Mademoiselle?
Mademoiselle,if you will write my fiancée
Will you fiancée mind if I asked you to dance?
Yes,who are you?
I'm part of the local colour
That's not being polite,Claude,I'd like very much to dance with this gentleman
-Is he always so possessive?
-Who?
Boyfriend
You just annoy him
You?
I'm all for a pretty little amusement
That Claude,he looks like he had some money
Yes,don't get any bright idea
Why not?
You wouldn't get very far
You did all right,didn't you?
-Do you live here in the casbah?
-Yeah
Do people like each other in the Casbah?
Very much
Sometimes they even get married
Yes,great weddings
Good I'm going to marry Monsieur
Durand,see how simple it is?
I understand it's love
Just a case of pure love
You understand things so well
We are both after the same thing
I'll bet my methods are a little different than yours
I don't have as much to work with as you do
You are no longer amusing
This isn't a circus,Mademoiselle,
I'm not here to amuse you
Shall we go back to then table now?
Keep playing
Does everyone here take orders from you?
Let's say they just like to co-operate
Let's say they do but I don't
Don't be foolish,Mademoiselle
You are a long way from home
Stay where you are
Nobody move
Say what is this
It's a raid
Le Moko
Here,put them on
Wait for me I'll be right back
All right,take him
Come on,quickly
Let's go
If you don't mind you could wait
I beg you pardon
He'll be right back when he says so
But the police have arrested him
That doesn't mean very much, they never get him out of the Casbah
You see for years years he's
 been getting away from the police
They can't be that stupid
But they are,Sir,they are very stupid,I know,I'm one of them
Permit me Inspector Slimane
How do you do,shall we go Gaby?
Why don't we stay,
Claude,it's exciting,I like it
But I thought
-Have you seen the gambling room?
-The gambling room
Oh,it's beautiful,just like Monte Carlo
-How exciting Claude
-All right
I feel lucky
That's the time to try it,Sir
We are going to stay and gamble,Madame if you haven't seen the finish of the dance,I'll be very happy to be with you
You go ahead,Claude,I'll be right along
She'll be perfectly safe with me,don't you think so,Sir?
-All right,I'll put a bet down for you
-Good Luck,Monsieur
I have a wonderful system
Should we be in with
 drinking in the meantime?
Come,hurry
Quick
Damn it
This is only your first,that's already..
Slimane gotta match?
You see didn't take him very long
Give these back to your boss
-You mind if I keep them?
-What for?
For you
Shall we finish our dance?
-What did he say?
-He likes you
-What else?
-Nothing,just who you are
Did he tell you what I do?
No,but he told me why you couldn't leave the Casbah
Where are your friends?
The gambling room
Don't you gamble?
Only if I win
There is a terrace where we really can see the Casbah
I don't think my friends would understand
What if they don't
They are waiting for me
Let me go
They don't count here
Please,please
Take this it's very expensive,really it is
What's it worth?
I don't know 50000 francs
50000 francs?
It's a lot of money
All for love
Pure,pure love
Good Morning,Sir
Good Morning
-What do you want?
-I,nothing
What happened?
Why didn't you tell me we'd be
 met with goats and garbage
Garbage? That's new never heard of that before
I'll get Pepe Le Moko out of there
-You won't
-Yes,if it's the last thing I do
Maybe
-Your medicine,Monsieur
-No,no,no
You still think I ought to
 leave the job to you
You intended to deliver le Moko eh
When,Sgt.?
Inspector
When? Inspector
Soon
How soon?
Within a few days
-Good Morning
-Good Morning
Going for a swim?It's warm
Good Morning
-Sleep well?
-Yes,thank you
Did you find your vanity case?
No Claude,I guess I did leave it in
 that place last night
-I am sorry,
-Solid gold with four diamonds
If Pierre given me anything like that we would never have gotten married
Why do you say that?
I would have dropped dead
I've heard people don't lose things by accident
What are you driving at,Claude?
You're a smart girl,Gaby
A handsome fee for his attentions on me or upon when I fall in love with him and forget my old vanity case to show that I don't want to leave,is that it?
You are way overhead of me,Gaby
You don't trust me to handle such matters,please say so
Don't try to be subtle it doesn't become you
Of course I trust you Gaby I'll be
 a fool no to,wouldn't I?
When do we sail out of here?
Any time you say
Tomorrow if that's make you feel sure of it
It seems to me you're the one not of sure
Oh the inspector,hello
I'm sorry to intrude
Good Morning,this is beautiful Mesdames
What are you doing here ,Inspector?
Oh,you remember this?
-I'm sure you missed it
-Thank you
Thank you very much
Wasn't it nice of him to bring this
Where did you find it?
I didn't find it,a friend of mine did Pepe le Moko
-Would you like a drink?
-Yes please
He would have liked to bring it himself but unfortunately he finds himself
 unable to leave the Casbah
Petty criminal with romantic notions
He's not a petty criminal
Well a thief then
Yes,but not petty he's a,he's
 a very remarkable thief
You see inspector,Monsieur Durand is a scrupulously honest man
He didn't make all his money on the black market
Just most of it
Thank you,Gaby
In my opinion any man that steals for a living is a fool
That's right
You weren't so something darling,remember?
Boy,she's preying(?)
He caught you the next day,you
 could never(?) a blind bat
I do not know what is so remarkable about Pepe but yes he is a thief,he's charming, he's romantic but there's more to it than that
That's enough for me
You see Pepe wants something he
He's willing to risk much more
 than anybody else I know
Really?
For a few diamonds he lost his freedom and for love,I think he'd give up his life
And how is it that he's still alive,inspector
That I don't know
Maybe he's never met the right woman
I'll see you all tonight at the festival
Festival?
No,we're sailing tomorrow early
Oh,no please you can't miss that, it's only once a year the most wonderful dancers and
 musicians will perform for you
So our last night Claude,I don't see any harm in going,do you?
Please you're shirking me
All right,the inspector will guide us so we don't lose anymore vanity cases
It'll be a great pleasures  touring you
I'm sure you won't regret it Madame
See you tonight at the Place de la Jura
-Madame
-Bye
I told you
Hello Pepe
Do you know something?
This isn't very far
A few more steps and you could be outside
You don't want me to get me that easy,do you Slamine?
Why not?
When do you want leave,today
Tomorrow would be fine
-I'm disappointed in you
-Why
You give up so easy
Got a cigarette Pepe?
-You know about last night
-What about last night
About that raid,I want to apologize, what can you expect from the police
That's the best they can do they'd be better of living outside
 down town at the hotel
Sure
You're absolutely right except
 you don't want to live outside
You've got everything you want right here,that what you said
-Good Morning
-Everything
Relax Slimane it was just a thought
-Early morning head ache,you know
-I know what that is still
Last night
Yeah,very exciting especially that lady,what's her name,Mademoiselle Reynaud
Whose of them?
You know the one whose bracelet you refused to take
I admit she is beautiful
Beautiful woman
Beautiful bracelet
Oh pardon me I forgot the practical women that's nothing new to you
There's something new in every woman
Are you interested?
Let's get little trouble for her
-I know you want
-Not enough to make you happy
Pepe
But you have to admit she has something unusual she's got a yearning point, adventure points,excitement
What happened
It's a shame,that silly man he'll make her very unhappy it's a playboy,he's too tired to appreciate her
She's got everything she wants
How would she know
I'll tell you she'd never
 been in love,never
-Slimane,I can't believe it
-What
You playing cupid
You would make a nice cup
Would you tell her about it
What could I tell
She's shocked of my past?
No,oh dear,she was a little appalled at your future
Don't worry I fixed it I told her
Good lawyer you'd get off
For 20 years
Do you think I'd leave the
 Casbah for any woman?
No,not for any woman
A drink,Madame,Madame,Madame may I dry(?) your face Madame
Very funny
How did the police know that
 I was at Odette last night
Well?
Not me,Pepe,I was drunk
Too drunk to move,you know that
Max,me a Judas
Pepe I'm so happy to see
That raid I couldn't sleep all night
My heart is pounding
What are you so nervous about?
I don't talk to you
You knew Pepe was going to
Odette before anybody else did
What does he?
All I know is the raid came the same day he showed up
Say the word,Danny,I'll cut his throat
Pepe,you know for you I risk my life but by the honour of my family I wouldn't
 take anything from this two-faced swindler
Look at his shirt
Striped silk
You are an informer
Run along
Get out
Go on
Get out all of you
You too
I wouldn't trust any of them,Pepe
Specially Omar
Sit down
Pepe
Give me a drink
Pep I didn't mean to
I said get me a drink
Got to get out of here
You don't know what you are saying,Pepe
The dirt,the noise
Day in day out I'm getting fed up
Sure I know
You're not going anywhere?
I thought you were my friend
I am
Do anything for you,Pepe,you know that
I got to leave
Be sensible
You said you'll do anything for me
You can't leave
You know what would happen to you if you did
Get to Paris by plane in six hours
You are crazy
Are you with me?
You'll never make it
Are you with me?
Anything you say Pepe
Pepe
The festival will start tonight
Hundreds of people will be going in and out of Casbah
The police will be kept busy
We'll leave then
Pepe
See you later
Pepe
You're all dressed up
You like it
Yes,very much
You know an innocent girl
You still angry with me
No,no
-You know I was jealous of that woman
-Yes I know
Silly woman all the diamonds
I suppose you thought you were really interested in her
Forget it
Pepe
Sometimes when you get angry with me,it's all right I understand
You are a fine girl,Inez
Remember last year at the festival how we sang and danced
Let's do it again tonight
I won't be here
-Where are you going?
-I'm leaving
-You are leaving the Casbah?
-Yes
Why?
That woman before she came
 you never talked like that
Stop it Inez
Don't you understand,don't you see,Pep, when she came here to look at the zoo at the monkey in the cage
She's nothing to do with it
There is no outside for you, just me and the Casbah
You'll never get out,they'll get you
So they'll get me
-Take me with you
-Too dangerous
I don't care take me with you
You think you can just get up and go
Well I tell you when you will go they'll carry you out that's when
Go on,run to your woman, stay out wherever you get
I'll never forget you,Inez
Pepe,I love you
Yes
Yes
He's leaving,yes
Don't worry we'll be there
Come on let's go
Pepe
Pepe don't go
Inez come on
How do you know it isn't a trap?
Pepe you don't have to go
She's back
-Where?
-At the Place de la Jura
With Slimane
Why don't you give up?
No woman can hold Pepe
Maybe not
You are not the first one who has tried it
I'll tell you this
I'll be the last
It is a little crowded around here
Hungry Abdullah
You see all during the festival day he isn't allowed to eat drinks smoke or enjoy the company of the other sex that's in daytime
Very interesting
We are going this way
Look what's going over here
Of course there are exceptions
Invalids,children and travellers they don't have to observe the fast
Muhammed must have been in
 favour of the tourist trade
Yes,we all are
We go this way,Sir
We came back for the festival
Just for the festival
We are sailing in the morning and we didn't want to miss it
High up you can see everything
How will I find my way back?
Let me worry about that
But you won't
You are beginning to understand me
It's a beautiful song
It means it was written in the stars
The fires are so warm from up here
It was written the stars shall be
Those men in the white robes
-Oh Monsieur,Monsieur,Monsieur
-About time,where is she?
Please you are looking at a very
 unhappy man,she's gone
-What do you mean,gone?
-Gone,just disappeared
If anything happen to her
 I hold you responsible
That's your privilege but please don't get excited just give me a few minutes
A few minutes? You had an hour
A few more minutes won't hurt I have to find her
I don't know where she is could be anywhere,could be with Pepe le Moko
I don't believe that,Inspector
-I didn't say she was
-That's right
She's probably back at the yacht,where it was,come on
That's possible,if you permit me, my men is going to take you back
We'll manage
-Please what if something happens to you
-Never mind
Inspector,I think you are cute
It's getting light now
You ordered everybody around
Ordered to stay dark for me
You can have it dark or light
Anything you want
Suppose I want rainbows
You can have rainbows
Suppose I want them every day
Only on Sunday
What were you like as a little boy?
I was skinny
You were very clever
I was very angry
Why?
Suppose I wanted all the things I couldn't have
I wanted things too
But in my time they had a sanct notion, they insisted that you go to work
-I had a job once
-No
Yes,selling wine nobody liked the wine except me so I drank of both and the boss (?)
What did you do after that?
Well,after that I was very unhappy
Then one morning I woke
 up with a great idea
Pepe I said to myself
Pepe you said to yourself?
Why are you so unhappy?
If you want things so badly take them
-How did you know?
-I had the same idea
But I wanted to be respectable
So now you got everything you want
You know what I give to the  (?)
Casbah the way you do
Lots of people live outside
On yachts,mansions only they don't call it the Casbah
-I must go now
-Why?
-They'll sail without me
-What if they do?
You don't really want me to stay, you don't have to pretend
-I'm not pretending
-Please
Don't make it difficult for me
Gaby,Gaby wait don't go, it won't be long,I'll get out
-But you can't
-I can
We'll go to a little town outside of Paris, no one would know me there
Yes,I can just see you in a small town
Why not? Do you think I like this
 life so much I can't give it up?
I've had enough of it,Gaby,Gaby we
 can live like everybody else
You'll be bored,you want to go to Paris
We'll go to Paris we see all the places
I used to know the cafés,the shops
You know the little square on top of Montmartre?
-Yes I used to eat there all the time
-We could go to the Latin quarter
I must go now
-Pepe
-Down those steps
What are you waiting for?
You didn't understand
I came for a little adventure
It's light now,the sun is all over
 and I have to go back
Nobody is keeping you
When we danced you said that we were after the same things but my methods were different than yours,it's true
All right that is true,go on
I'll tell Claude that I was lost
He'll be sorry
He'll buy me another bracelet and that's what I want
Of course
That's what you wanted, anyone could see that
I didn't think I'll ever feel this way
You can go Gaby
Won't make any difference I'll follow you
You wouldn't do that
Before you said the police would get you
I'll take that chance
When you think it over you'll change your mind,I know you will
No use Gaby you might as well stay
I'll come back
-When?
-Tonight
Promise?
Yes,yes I promise
Tonight Odette's 8 o'clock
8 o'clock
Pepe
Waiting for someone Inez?
Leave me alone
I won't
You look like you might get into trouble
You? You brought her in here and I know why
I know how you are feeling,we both want Pepe more than anything on earth
I won't lose him Slimane
But you will very soon very soon
Here you are Madame,here
 you are,I am so happy
Oh,Inspector
I'll just sent(?) him we have responsible all your friends they are so worried
All right they needn't worry any more
Does that mean that you'll sail with them?
-Yes right away
-That's good,that's good
Now if you excuse me Madame,
I have a cab waiting for you
Thank you
Right outside the gate
Madame
I suppose it hurts,eh
Stay out of it
Where were you Gaby?
Paris,Montmartre,Montparnasse,oh no
-Seven o'clock
-Is it really?
Where were you?
-Say I was lost
-Do you expect me to believe that?
Believe anything you like
We are going to settle this right now
All right let's settle it
Have you got any pretty
 decency in you Gaby?
To go out with that cheap little brash up(?) with clothes on your back first tools and then
-Gaby
-Yes,Claude
We are going to sail out here in about 10 minutes
If you like the idea of the Casbah better
 than the prospect of the future with me
Why don't you go back there
There is still time
-What happened
-Nothing
-Come on,it couldn't be that serious
-Leave me alone,Madeleine
-Come on,Gaby,tell me
-I told you,nothing happened
I saw him again,he wanted me to stay,and I told him I'll come back
Are you crazy?
Well,he threatened to follow me and
I had to say something
-You lied to him?
-Yes
He won't follow me,not with
 the police waiting for him
-Of course not
-No man would do that,would he?
Gaby you are not in love with him?
That's one lottery you can't afford
-I know you all have said that
-Yes and I am right
I know
Stop thinking about it,you forget him
Go up on deck and be nice to Claude
You'll get over it in a little while
He'll forgive you and everybody will be happy
Gaby,you can have everything
 you ever wanted
Thank you,Madeleine
-Gaby I just
-I'm not staying,Claude
Get out?
-I'm going to accept your offer
-What offer?
To go back
Do you realize what you are doing?
Yes,I'm giving up the prospect of a future with you
You won't leave,Gaby
Because if you do you won't be taking anything with you you go back just the way you came,you won't do that Gaby you are too fond of those pretty little
 things I bought you,aren't you?
-Gaby how will you live?
-I'll manage
-Where will you go?
-Most probably a hotel
I always remember you,Claude, for your great generosity
She's been much too noble, don't you think so,Claude
Thank you
I'll see that she gets this
You seem very happy this morning
-Why not? Do you mind?
-No,no,no,please I like to see you that way
-Be happy,so much as possible
-Sit down Slimane
You know I almost left the Casbah yesterday
Where did you intended to go?
Paris
-What stopped you Pepe?
-You
-You fixed it and Paris came to me
-She did
She's beautiful
You want to see her again?
I'm going to,tonight
-It's all arranged
-I know it's all arranged
I know it,it's very amusing
Say Slimane
How are you getting along with the Commissioner?
Fine,fine,don't worry about that
Pepe,we made a little deal
I promised to bring you in and he promised to leave me alone
Should I be careful?
It won't help you
You are going to walk right into the
 trap and with your eyes wide open
That's what's so funny
It would be very funny,wouldn't it?
I suppose you've even set the time
I've set the hour
Why don't you give up,Slimane?
I can't
You'd never had a chance before, you don't have a chance now
But I can,Pepe,I'm not the commissioner Louvain
He can make a mistake,he's a big man but I'm little man,one mistake
-Too bad,Pepe
-I feel so sad
-Haven't caught me yet
-That's right

Very nice of you
Omar,Pepe said to get cash
I understand,but some of the ladies are interested to see a typical Moorish café
Bring it to Odette at 8 o'clock
I will do this,I'll show you a typical Moorish café
-You'd better be right,Slimane
-How could I be wrong
The yacht has sailed,the girl is on board,Pep is waiting
How long can a man like Pepe wait?
Not very long,Sir
I checked the yacht,it sailed
Did she?
But the girl didn't sail with it,she went to hotel Oasis
Went to the hotel Oasis?
Well,Slimane so he'll just come walking out eh
-It doesn't look so good,does it?
-No it doesn't
Not at the moment

Don't worry,Inspector,

I don't know
Look,Pepe

He was stabbed
Some girl in liaison,

Don't forget your plane leaves at six in the morning
You want to see me Pepe
Yes,sit down

What did you say?
Nothing
You are new around her,Carlo
They don't know you yet
I want you to go outside and find out what you can
She'll be here in a minute,Pepe
What's the matter you afraid?
Me afraid?
Sure I'll go
Go on
I never saw you so upset
 about a woman before
I don't get it
Go on Carlo you're wasting time
Leave it to me
Is everything all right Pepe?
Is a woman always have to be an hour late?
Takes time to be beautiful
Yes I guess so
Omar?
Where is Omar?
What do you need him for?
Suppose to bring me something at 8 o'clock
He can't come,Pepe, he was arrested
-Omar?
-Yes,Pepe
This afternoon in front of Hotel Oasis
Monsieur Prefect I don't understand it,I simply don't
Excuse me I can't talk when you

The whole town is teaming with thieves,cut-throats,murderers all kind of subjects and who do the police pick up from all the people
Omar,Omar the guide respectable man with a family,oh Commissioner such a family
Where did you get these jewels?
You should see my son Adrian, little boy three years old he uses all the tricks in the world give him ,what jewels?
These jewels right here
Such jewels
I've never seen them in my life
They were found in your pocket
Beautiful it must cost a fortune
This photo,I don't know if you understand
Whose pockets?
You were carrying them for Pepe le Moko
You know how it is
I'm riding in overcrowded street cars
I hang my coat in restaurants, somebody dropped
Pepe le Moko
That thief,that scoundrel, oh Commissioner you are hurting me you are offending me,I'm a respectable man I'm honest man
-With a family,yes
-How do you know?
We know I'm tired of your lies ,Omar
Send him in
I have a little surprise for you
We are not as stupid as you think
I didn't think you were stupid
We don't pick up people without good reason
I'm very happy to hear that
Excuse me my wife is waiting for me
Come in Carlo
Sit down
You recognize this man?
My worthy fellow,Commissioner
I've never seen him before in my life his face is completely unfamiliar to me
Take your time take a good look
No I'm sorry I have to disappoint you but I mean I don't know who he is,excuse me
Wait I'll pay you back you
You snake,you informer,I'm sorry for the spit I spent on you

How do you do?
It seems le Moko is getting desperate
Yes,Pepe send me out to look for the girl
You didn't know about Carlo?
How do you do
What's the matter with you?
With me? Nothing
Pepe
What's the matter?
Why is it so quiet?
-Where is everybody?
-It's very late,Pepe
Who said it's late?
Let's have some music
Julio play something
What is this? A funeral?
I said some noise that's
 what I came here for
Where are the girls at that?
All right,Pepe
What are you doing here?
Can't you see I'm laughing
Very funny
Get out
I was down at the harbour this morning
What for?
I like the sea air,they say it makes you beautiful
I saw a big white yacht today
I saw it sail away
I told you to get out,didn't I?
Everyone down at the harbour can tell you, the stevedores,the sailors,they all know
It sailed away,Pepe,she's gone
She is out there on the wide open sea with her sweetheart and I hope they bump..
I found her Pepe
I went all over before I found her
-Where?
-Hotel Oasis Room 104
Why didn't she come up here?
I don't know she was crying so much
 tears running down her cheeks
You know how women is
Don't listen to him,Pepe, it's a trick to catch you
He's lying can't you see he's lying
Let's go Carlo
-How did you know she was there?
-That was easy
-Who told you?
-Omar
He takes parties from the hotel to the Casbah he saw her there
When did you meet Omar?
About an hour ago
Run into him on the way down
In the Rue Cleve near the gate
Sit down Carlo
Don't you think we ought to go Pepe?
Sit down
You are a true friend Carlo
Men is very lucky to have a friend like you,have something to eat,drink
No thanks Pepe

-Feel better
-Sure
Some caviare
-Shame to waste it
-I'm not hungry,Pepe
Eat
Eat

Omar was arrested
This afternoon
You did it Carlo
The truth I'm waiting
Truth,Carlo or I kill you
-Slimane planned it
-Go on
I would tell Slimane that they are waiting for you
-She didn't leave
-No
Where is she?
-I told you she is at the hotel
-Don't lie
-She is at the hotel
-Why didn't she come up here?
Slimane told her you were killed
He made up the whole story
That's how he got her not to come up here, she is leaving for Paris by plane 6 o'clock
I didn't want to Pepe
They made me
They promised me my freedom
You know what is to be cooked-up
They would kill me
We were brought up together
Don't kill me
I know there was those times when mother(?)
It's like to go home
Everything here is yours
Thank you,Pepe,I don't want it
Then must someone else have it
All right
Well
I guess there is nothing left to say
Nothing?
Come on Inez you know why I'm leaving

Why don't you do something
Say something
At least cry
I never cry
Good Bye Inez

You knew I would
Subtitles by Seglora
The show must go on
The show must go on
To answer all the clamour
For oomph and glamour and so on
To captivate Tom, Dick and Harry
Each Matilda, Kay and Carrie
Cleopatra and DuBarry
Puts her show on
Way back in history
Old Adam didn't give a care
There was no mystery
A rag, a bone, a hank of hair
But since humanity
Discovered vanity
We only know the show must go on
We only know the show must go on
This clever lyrical endeav our
Could probably go on forever
But all we're saying is what you know
That glamour is a woman's show
The show most people lik e to view
Is evident in burlesque
That show must go on
The show must go on
The show must go on
To answer all the clamour
For oomph and glamour and so on
But since humanity
Discovered vanity
We only know the show must go on
But the show we show
Is different because
We don't depend on this
Nor this for applause
That sort of thing
We scornfully dismiss
For
This
We only know the show must go on!
Hey, Genius!
Coming.
Oh, those poor people.
The entertainment can start.
The Genius is here.
Don't let the customers hear. The house can be emptied in three minutes.
Listen, kids.
That number's still ragged. On your entrance, keep your heads down.
- Our mothers told us not to do it.
- You can't teach old daughters new tricks.
We'll see if I can at 9:00 tomorrow morning.
Rehearsals are at 10.
Go on, you got five minutes to make your change.
Those little dames can sure gripe.
The bigger the gripe, the better the army, Jim.
- And there is a great army.
- You're not kidding.
Well, I just won't show up.
I have an appointment at 9:00, and I'll keep it.
It's my chance to get out of here and into the big time.
- What big time?
- The big time has nothing to do with 9:00.
- You got a line on a job, Maurine?
- You bet I have.
It has nothing to do with 9:00 either, or 10:00.
You can sleep all day.
- I've never heard of a job like that.
- No? Here, look for yourself.
Not that I think I'm the most beautiful girl in the world...
...but I think I can at least try.
"Vanity's Golden Wedding Girl.
Fame and fortune await the girl...
...on the cover of Vanity's 50th anniversary number.
Who will she be? She could be you."
How could getting your face on a magazine get you into the big time?
A cover girl's face can unlock any door.
- I've got a face. I'll use it.
- I don't understand.
If you can do better, why should Mr. McGuire object?
The McGuire slogan is to get there on your feet, not your face.
Can you imagine me asking him?
My name is Rusty Parker.
Parker.
Could I see Mr. Coudair about the Vanity cover?
Miss Jackson, Mr. Coudair's assistant, does interviews. She'll try to see you.
Thank you.
What on earth are you doing here?
Oh, same thing you are, I guess.
You shouldn't be such a good salesman.
Does Danny know you came?
Well, I didn't tell him, if that's what you mean.
He's gonna be sore at me. But you...
...egads, he'll cut you up in little pieces.
Well, he doesn't have to know.
Does he, Maurine?
No, of course not.
Save it, kitties. Don't waste it on me.
That redhead isn't bad.
No, she isn't.
All right, Marion, let the bars down.
Carry on, Colby.
Maurine Martin, please.
Egads, wish me luck.
That girl has a really lovely figure...
...if she knew how to walk.
Ever done any modelling?
No, but all you have to do is keep still, isn't it?
That always helps.
Does it matter I've never modelled?
No, in this case, we prefer it.
Now sit down and stand up again several times.
I mean stand.
You're a very pretty girl, little on the brash side, however.
Our girl has to be quiet and demure.
After all, the cover is a bride.
Who's the girl with you, the one with the red hair?
Oh, she works in the same joint...
I mean, the same nightclub in Brooklyn I do.
Danny McGuire's. Why?
She's pretty.
Now smile directly at me.
And she looks relaxed.
If only you gals could realise how important it is to be quiet and relaxed.
Nice teeth.
Keep your nightlife down and your hopes up. You may hear from us.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
B.J. Graham.
Are my seams straight?
They're all right, darling.
Don't make the mistakes I made.
Keep talking and move around a lot.
Be animated.
That's what they're after. Even if you overdo it, be animated.
Don't relax for a minute.
Don't let her know you're new.
Say anything, but impress it on her you've modelled before.
- But I haven't.
- Rusty Parker.
Don't forget. Be animated.
Hello! How do you do?
My name is Rusty Parker.
And you're Miss Jackson.
I've heard so much about you.
I suppose you've noticed
I'm so full of animation...
...it's impossible for me to sit still.
My grandmother said it's because my glands worked right.
I suppose you'd like to know about my experience.
I've done so much, all kinds of things.
I've been on more bottles...
Cold cures are my specialty.
You know, sneezes and animated stuff, things like that.
I have some photographs here...
I'd rather you wouldn't take them out.
I don't feel up to capturing them if they get loose.
I think there's something you can take.
I'd find out about it.
Take? For what?
Those glands. They're going to turn on you one of these days.
But why can't I be the Golden Wedding Girl, Mr. Coudair?
Your face is familiar to everyone who picks up a magazine.
- I want a new face.
- I don't blame you. So do I.
What is a new face anyway? I hear about them, but I've never seen one.
All right, Mr. Coudair.
But I don't know how a bride can be new and experienced at the same time.
- May I come in?
- It won't do you any good.
Your face isn't new enough.
Fine thing!
I saw the Golden Wedding Dress.
It's a dream. Don't you love it?
For now, there's nothing about this contest I love. It's beautiful.
If you got me a dress like that,
I'd marry anybody.
Then I'll be very careful not to, Jinx.
We need you in our business.
Stonewall, there's the layout.
The dress is ready. There's the deadline. Where's the face?
I have brought you 10,000 batches of photographs by slow count.
Colby and I have been looking too.
You're very hard to please.
- You don't know what you want.
- I know exactly what I want.
- I want a girl with a story in her eyes.
- Drawing room or smoking room?
What does a young girl think about when she's going down the aisle?
That's the look I want...
...that young, wondering, misty look.
Well, now we have a clue, Jinx.
She must be misty.
I can find you a lot of foggy ones.
Thanks for helping us, Jinx.
Somebody helped me to get started, didn't they? Bye.
John, I'm desperate.
There isn't a thing that Harry Conover hasn't made well-known...
...except this one. She's at least new.
We've got to choose somebody.
Very pretty girl.
Let me go take a look at her.
This mania you have for peering at these creatures in their native haunts...
I should know after all these years I can't change you.
Is this one worth going to Brooklyn to see?
Where on earth is that?
I think you take a bridge to get there.
- Evening, Pop.
- Oh, hello, girls.
Hello, Danny.
If you'd had a horse under you in North
Africa instead of one of them tanks...
...you wouldn't have got shot up the way you was and sent home.
Where'd it get you, Danny?
In Libya.
Well, it don't show a bit.
- Evening, Pop.
- Cold out, ain't it, Rusty?
Sure is.
Hi, chicken.
Hello, Danny.
Missed you for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Don't you eat anymore?
- I wasn't hungry tonight.
- Weren't you hungry this morning?
Who stole my nylons? Egads, a very...
- Not very.
- Too much rehearsal last night, huh?
- It was kind of a workout.
- That why you slept late?
Oh, I didn't sleep late. I went uptown.
Shopping?
No, I went to see a man...
...about a face.
I thought you went to buy me a wedding present.
Why? You getting married?
Didn't you hear?
Why, no, Mr. McGuire.
And who is the lucky girl?
She's kind of a funny kid. She's sore because she's got diamonds in her feet.
Can you imagine that?
Rusty, not many people have diamonds in their feet.
They threw me out, Danny.
They didn't want me up there.
They didn't like my face.
You've got a beautiful face. Is it your worry they don't know their business?
Well, I get so tired, Danny.
This way, it takes so long before you get anywhere.
If you can get there quicker, why shouldn't you?
When you get there quick, you're out quick.
Easy get, easy lose.
I've never seen it fail.
You gotta work for what you get.
You're gonna be a star, but you gotta get there on your feet, not your face.
Old shortcut Susie.
Old hard way McGuire.
We're a fine pair.
We're a wonderful pair.
Aren't we though?
Dally, dally, dally. Nothing around here all day but dilly-dally.
I better get dressed.
I said it 100 times.
You don't get there on the steps.
You get there on your...
But it depends on what you're after.
Day and night, night and day, all I do is work and slave...
...to keep this place with its head underwater.
My number comes up, it goes to pieces.
People sitting on the steps, chef quitting, noisy kitchen, girls always gabbing.
- I'm not complaining.
- You're on.
Coming!
My butcher shop
My grocery
Can k eep on saying no, sirree
But lack of this
Or that
Doesn't knock me flat
Foreign times lik e these
Life's no life of these
Although I'm no saint
I have no complaint
We must do that task
And it's little enough
They ask:
"Who's Complaining?"
I'm not complaining
You'll see
We'll see this thing through
Because of Axis' trick ery
My coffee now is chicory
And I can rarely purloin
A sirloin
No complaining
Through the campaigning
Who cares if carrots are few
I'll feed myself on artichok es
Until that Nazi Party chok es
So long as they don't ration
My passion
For you
You know if things go on
At the rate they're going
And goods flow out
At the rate they're flowing
The time isn't very far away
When this will be my typical day
At breakfast time just after I get up
If there's little on the breakfast setup
For the little I'm served
I'm well repaid
By the little that's on the serving maid
The trip downtown
Which once was boring
Now's a journey I k eep adoring
A man is a dope who yells and storms
At the lack of the drivers' uniforms
And at the office during the duration
What a pleasure giving dictation
It ain't so bad in the land of the free
Being a dictator lik e me
And when my lady and I go dining
Though the menu's cloudy
There's a silver lining
That's the one.
A fellow just looks around the floor
Who could ask for anything more?
Who could ask for anything more?
Who's complaining?
I'm not complaining
The sacrifices are few
- My shoes may not be leathery
- My pillow not so feathery
My legs may be forgotten
In cotton
No complaining
Through the campaigning
I'll raise no hullabaloo
My nails may lose their brilliancy
But who cares what civilians see
So long as they don't ration
My passion
For you
Good night. Happy kitchen.
Good night. Happy office.
Good ni...
Good night. Happy taxi.
Good night. Happy smoking.
Have that girl come and see me tomorrow.
I'm glad you liked her. I thought she was quite unusual-looking for a blond.
No, the one with the red hair.
Oh, the red hair. Oh, the red hair!
I'll be in the study for calls.
I don't know why you pay me if you ignore my judgment. Stop whistling!
I wear myself out, wading through
10,000 girls, and out of the 10,000...
...you choose a redheaded nervous breakdown who specializes in sneezes.
She told me so.
That one isn't a girl, John.
She's a leaping thyroid.
I don't believe I've been in a honky-tonk place like McGuire's for 40 years.
I don't know why I've saved this. Take a look at it. You're interested in antiques.
If we got her for our cover...
- But, John, this is her.
- Who?
The... The girl, the gland case.
This program is dated 40 years ago.
How could it be?
Well, it couldn't be, but it is.
Forty years ago.
The night I got this, I was sitting in a box with Tony Pastor.
She was the most beautiful thing
I'd ever seen.
I fell in love with her
the minute I saw her.
The fav ourite doesn't always win
No matter what the odds
Since nobody knows
How they'll come in
I leave it to the gods
So wish me luck
Because I'm going to bet on
A sentimental hunch
My heart is suddenly set on
Somehow, I'm sure I've found
The sure thing in you
Something within
Tells me we'll win
Somewhere, my heart
Has pick ed you out of the blue
And since I'm only a beginner
A winner I'll be
But win or lose
Whatever comes up
You're thumbs up
With me
One thing I'm sure I'm sure of
All my life through
If love can figure out a sure thing
That sure thing is you
After the races are over
After the races are run
Loser or winner
Let's go out to dinner
And let's have a little
Let's have a little fun
Let's go to Rector's or Shanley's
Champagne and duck are divine
Let's lose our troubles
Imbibing some bubbles
Oh, let's have a little
Let's have a little wine
Then when we're mellow
And feeling alive
Let's tak e a drive along Riverside Drive
No drive in the country for me after dark
My limit is just once around
Central Park
After the races are over
Being with you will be bliss
Perhaps you'll surrender
When gentlemen tender
Say, "Let's have a little
Let's have a little kiss!"
Though you are tender
I cannot surrender
To "Let's have a little
Let's have a little kiss!"
Somehow I'm sure I've found
The sure thing in you
Taking romance
I tak e no chance
Somewhere my heart has pick ed you
Out of the blue
But if it turns out that my long shot's
A wrong shot
Should be
And all my castles come a' tumbling
No grumbling from me
Long shot
One thing I'm sure of
All my life through
If love can figure out a sure thing
That sure thing
Is you
- I've got to meet her, Mr. Pastor.
- Now, John...
...last time, your mother had the
Decency League investigate my place.
Mother's quite a girl.
Shall we go backstage?
No. Now, in the first place,
Maribelle's already spoken for.
See that boy at the piano?
- Don't bother me with trifles.
- And, John...
...I promised your mother I wouldn't introduce you to girls.
Maribelle isn't just another girl,
Mr. Pastor.
I'm going to marry her.
John. John!
- I'm ready, darling.
- Wonderful, so am I.
John, have you lost your mind?
At your most beautiful service, mademoiselle.
Well.
- Miss Hicks, how are you?
- Who is this?
- I never saw him before in my life.
- I'm John Coudair.
The only thing in your life, so make the best of it.
If anyone should enquire for us, we've gone to Rector's to discuss our future.
Unless it's my mother.
Then you haven't seen me.
Now just a minute.
You're a perfectly enchanting person,
Mr. Coudair.
Not even bad-looking, in a strange sort of way.
But I have an engagement, and it's not with you or at Rector.
- But...
- I don't even know you.
What's the difference?
This was meant to be. Can't you see?
You don't belong in a dingy hole.
You should be surrounded by luxury, beauty, elegance.
I can give you these things, Maribelle.
Just climb aboard my magic carpet, and away we'll go.
From Rector's we went on to...
Pardon me.
Yes.
Oh, dear, I forgot all about it.
Yes, I'll look it over immediately.
Thanks for reminding me.
That advertising prospectus...
That advertising prospectus the lender sent over.
Completely slipped my mind.
- Good night.
- Hey, wait a minute.
What does Maribelle got to do with this kid? Are they related?
I haven't the faintest idea.
By the way, don't wait until tomorrow.
Send that child a wire tonight, will you?
- Hello, Joe
- What do you know?
- I just came back from a bing-bang show
- A sing and a dance
- I'll tak e a chance
- Well, flippity-jippity
- Let's go!
- Okay.
Come on, pearl.
- Oh, how I hate oysters.
- Ain't they repulsive?
I don't get it.
Every Friday night for the last six months, they order oysters.
Then they don't eat them.
- We don't like oysters.
- Joe, we're looking for a pearl.
The night we find that pearl, that'll be it. It'll be an omen.
That'll be the time when things break for all three of us.
- You know what?
- What?
I think it's a fake. I don't think pearls comes from oysters.
- Pearls don't come from oysters.
- How long since you left Harvard?
Never heard of it. Be reasonable.
How could a oyster give birth to a pearl?
How could an oyster give birth to an oyster?
Hey, that's something to think about.
Let them live their lives, and I'll live mine.
- When? I wanna see that.
- I don't.
Oh, you fools, you.
Rusty, did you find a pearl?
- No pearls.
- No pearls.
Well, better luck tomorrow.
Tomorrow!
Here we go again.
Let's k eep on singing,
"Mak e way for tomorrow!"
The sun is bringing a new day tomorrow
Don't let the clouds get you down
Show me a smile, not a frown
Stand up and win
Turn about
Don't give in!
Let's give out!
To the blues
Just refuse to surrender
One smile
And you are a true, solid sender
What if it rains and it pours?
It only rains out of doors!
Let every frown disappear
And you'll find that tomorrow's here
Listen, all
This is Genius calling
- Hear ye!
- Hear ye!
- Why not gather rainbows while ye may?
- While ye may?
You can lose the gremlins
The goblins, the glooms
Laugh and they're back in their tombs
Let's k eep on singing,
"Mak e way for tomorrow!"
The sun is bringing
A new day tomorrow
Don't let the clouds get you down
Show me a smile, not a frown
Stand up and win
Turn about
Don't give in
Let's give out
To the blues
Just refuse to surrender
One smile
And you are a true, solid sender
What if it rains and it pours?
It only rains out of doors
Let all the frowns disappear
And you'll find that tomorrow's...
That's pretty. That's very, very pretty.
Glad to see you.
Hi, Mac.
Hello, Harry.
Maybe it's a draft notice.
Danny, it's from John Coudair.
Who's he?
He publishes that magazine that wants a...
He wants me to come to the office tomorrow.
What do you suppose happened?
How did he ever...?
One hour rehearsal at 10, honey.
I'll see you then.
Yeah, I'll try to make it, Danny.
Good night.
I don't feel good.
Oh, you don't? Where?
In the hall.
I felt sick the minute you got the telegram. Didn't you, Danny?
I think Rusty knows what she wants to do with her own life.
- Lf she wants to go it alone...
- I don't wanna go it alone.
I wanna go it with you, Danny, but...
Well, the man sent for me, Genius.
It just doesn't seem polite not to...
Well, he might not even like me.
Ever see a man that didn't?
- Skip it, will you?
- No, I won't skip it.
I've got some stock in this corporation, and I'm certainly going to protect it.
I like Danny McGuire's Place and you two there every night.
I like oysters and...
- You hate oysters.
- Ain't they repulsive?
Then I like opening oysters, and I like the clowning around in Joe's Place...
...and the laughs and the music and everything.
I like that pearl we're gonna find.
You don't want this.
Do you?
Now you two say good night like you mean it.
Good night, chicken.
Night, Danny.
You're a genius at everything but minding your own business, aren't you?
A girl's got a right to make up her mind about her own life.
Why didn't you let her tear up her own telegram?
It's things like this that make me a genius. Ain't they?
Wait until the landlady sees the hall.
All right, I'll clean it up.
Big thing.
- Rusty Park er to see you.
- Send her right in please.
All right, I'm trying not to be excited.
What would you do if your youth walked in the door?
I'd put braces on its teeth.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Come in.
This is Mr. Coudair, Miss Parker.
- How do you do, Miss Parker?
- How do you do?
Well, you have ambitions to be a cover girl?
Well... I did have.
I find Miss Parker exceptionally reposed.
- I thought you told me that she leaped.
- She did leap.
What happened to that lovely, gay, rose- in-the- teeth personality you had?
- Did I look like that?
- Exactly.
No wonder you threw me out.
I'm not a very good actress, am I?
That was acting?
That was acting.
Sit down, won't you?
We saw you, quite by accident, at Danny McGuire's Place last night.
- You dance beautifully.
- I've had good training.
Apparently.
It seems to come to you so naturally...
...I was wondering if someone in your family were a dancer.
Your mother, perhaps?
Oh, no.
My mother couldn't dance a note.
- She raised cattle.
- Cattle?
My grandmother was a dancer.
I don't suppose you ever heard of her.
- Maribelle Hicks?
- Your grandmother?
Oh, my goodness, how time flies, doesn't it?
She was kind of a star.
Well, it seems I've mislaid a few years somewhere.
Is she living, Miss Parker?
Your grandmother?
- No, she died about six months ago.
- I see.
- All right, let's get to work.
- When I think what I've gone through...
...trying to find a girl who all the time was in your desk drawer, I could scream.
- I suppose you're finished with me.
- Finished with you?
My dear child, we're just beginning with you.
Just climb aboard my magic carpet and away we'll go.
Did you know Rusty won this contest, Maurine?
Not until this came out today.
That double- crossing little so-and-so.
- I don't think Danny knows it either.
- She takes a swell picture, doesn't she?
Anyone would with the trouble they go to.
Your grapes are so sour
I can smell them from here.
Be with you in a minute, kids.
Pretty.
Oh!
What are you...?
- In the mood to be great again tonight?
- Yeah, I'm...
Singing and dancing all the time, that's me.
Oh, you're such a joy and comfort to us all.
Yeah, I'm a joy and a...
- Oh, by the way, Genius...
- By the what?
Oh. The way.
- What's the matter with you?
- Just trying out a new step. Like it?
- Cut the clowning, will you?
- Who's clowning?
You're sitting on a piece of paper.
Isn't he silly? Have I got time to sit on paper? I'm not even sitting.
- Go bake a cake.
- Genius, you're on.
Coming!
Danny, didn't you say she could live her own life?
Genius!
Go ahead, let them have the face.
You got what's left.
- Genius, you're on!
- Yes.
Hi.
Hi, yourself.
- I think it's swell. Congratulations.
- Well, thank you, Danny.
I think it's swell. Like you said, if you can get there quicker, why shouldn't you?
- Danny, you wanna know something?
- What?
You were right that you don't get there on your face.
That magazine's been out all day and nothing's happened.
Nothing.
I guess I thought the sky would fall in or something.
Well, it didn't.
This puts me in a great spot, chicken.
If I'm sorry nothing came of it, I'm a liar.
If I'm glad, I'm a heel.
Where do we go from here?
Dancing around the world, Danny.
On my feet.
Sure, I'll marry you. Who is this?
Who?
The New York News?
Yeah, she works here.
- This it?
- This is it. We covered the waterfront.
You have to dig to find a precious stone.
It's up to you to put her in her proper place.
Brooklyn to Broadway in one cover, that's quite a jump.
She has an old magic carpet that came in mighty handy.
- I have a reservation. John Coudair.
- Your hat, sir?
Oh, yes, Mr. Coudair. This way, sir.
- Hello, children.
- Hello.
- Hello, Colby.
- Hello, Jinx.
- Hello. Good hunting, son.
- Thanks, pal.
The days of the good old knights are gone
But chivalry still carries on
I wear no armour
But to my charmer
I hereby pledge my all
In other words
I'm at your beck and call
Put me to the test
And I'll climb you the highest mountain
Or swim you Radio City fountain
Put me to the test
And I'll get you a queen's tiara
Or a pyramid from the hot Sahara
You can dress in sables
At nightclub front tables
If that is what my lady adores
Put me to the test, lady
Just mak e your request
And anything that you desire
Is yours
Put me to the test
Put me to the test
- Oh, stop looking like an old mother cat.
- What do you think?
Why didn't you tell me she had talent, besides being exciting, beautiful...
What do I think?
- Is this what you want?
- Yeah!
Ladies and gentleman, your favourite cover girl...
...and my favourite dancer, Rusty Parker.
- You didn't bring a trumpet, did you?
- Why a trumpet?
I want to make an impressive entrance.
- Nice going, Rusty.
- Gee, you really...
- Remember what he used to...?
- Knew what she was talking about.
- It was a wonderful feeling.
- What are you crying about?
I don't know.
Kids, imagine a star being born to parents like me and Danny?
More like someone giving birth to an earthquake.
Break it up, break it up.
Rusty's skipping the next number.
Take the girls on, will you?
Thanks. I'm the act that follows the act.
Give me some lights. I'll murder them.
Rusty, this happens to very few people.
Take care of it and treat it right.
I beg your pardon.
Oh, here you are.
I've been in the theatre many years, and I've never seen...
Excuse me, please.
As I was saying, I've been in the theatre a number of years and...
- As I was saying, I've been in the theatre...
- I'm beginning to believe that.
- Hello, Rusty.
- Hello, Mr. Coudair.
Hello, Miss Jackson.
Danny, these are...
- Well, this is Mr. McGuire.
- How do you do, sir?
I was saying that I've...
This gentleman has been in theatre a good many years.
You've been in my theatre many years too. Why don't you scram?
- Of course we'll go. We...
- That's all right.
You're perfectly welcome to stay, but this guy...
This guy is with us, Mr. McGuire.
We brung him.
- I'm sorry.
- That's my one virtue: Nice friends.
Rusty, this is Noel Wheaton of
Wheaton's Theatre. This is Mr. McGuire.
- Hello. How are you?
- One side, please.
We're a little crowded here.
Would you mind moving?
- Forgive us.
- Make yourselves at home, will you?
Look, people with clothes on.
I have to get on next.
Would you excuse me? Maurine.
- Coming.
- Miss Parker...
- Oh, hello, Miss Jackson.
- Hello.
Why didn't you tell me you wanted somebody animated?
I was just holding myself in when I was in your...
- Have you gone batty or something?
- Is it something in me...
...that brings that out in people?
- Sorry.
Can't we go to your dressing room and talk?
- Well, I dress with seven other girls.
- You dress with seven other girls?
Yes, and they talk a lot and get dressed and undressed...
Wouldn't it be simpler if we just lay down and let them walk over us?
- I don't know why we're here anyway.
- We're offering Miss Parker a job.
- Oh, but I have a job.
- Rusty, you gotta make that change.
- Mr. McGuire.
- Excuse me.
We are definitely in the man's way here.
Let's find...
How do you feel about selling Miss Parker's contract?
Miss Parker has no contract.
- No... Oh, what are we waiting for?
- I don't know. What are you waiting for?
Miss Parker's free to work for me if she wants?
Miss Parker'd be free to work for you if she wanted to...
...whether she'd signed a paper or not.
You don't understand people working together that way, do you?
- No, I don't.
- No, you wouldn't.
- Make your change, Rusty.
- Okay.
- Well, I hope I see you again sometime.
- You'll see nothing but me, beautiful.
That sounds very exciting, coming from the great Noel Wheaton.
You know, he said you were free to come work for me if you wanted.
- I know he did. Good night.
- Good night.
- I guess my trumpet was out of tune.
- I thought I heard a sour note.
Baby! You were wonderful tonight.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
I mistook you for somebody else.
- Glad to see you.
- So sorry.
Excuse me.
- Oh, wait!
- Gangway.
- Busy little place tonight, wasn't it?
- Yeah, wasn't it?
One had to chop one's way through the upper crust, didn't one?
Yeah, one did.
Shortcuts are no good, huh?
They only make you famous overnight.
That's all. No work, no nothing.
Just smile at the birdie, and boom! You're in.
Name in all the papers. Big stars sending you pretty dresses for nothing.
That was terrific tonight.
You bet it was terrific.
Best goodbye music
I ever danced to.
Yeah, tonight was really terrific.
See a thing like that happen right under your eyes.
Something you wanted for someone all their life.
You haven't known me all my life.
Six months then.
Seven.
Seven then.
Seven months, three days, four hours, 23 minutes.
It was Tuesday.
Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last
Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look
And then I knew
That all I longed for
Long ago was you
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last
Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look
And then I knew
That all I longed for
Long ago was you
Egad, this place looks like a funeral parlour.
Nobody cares if roses give me hay fever.
- Where are your shoes?
- In the dressing room!
- Get them!
- I can't! The dressing room...
...is full of photographers taking pictures of the mirror!
For Pete's sake, why?
It's gonna be in the Sunday paper. The mirror where Rusty first saw her face.
- Mr. McGuire.
- I know. Do the best you can.
That newspaperwoman is eating my precious food.
She is doing a story on what food makes the figure of Rusty Parker.
- I said, do the best you can.
- I quit.
All right, then quit!
- Genius.
- Yes.
- Where is Rusty? Find her.
- Relax.
She's all right. She's on the stage being interviewed.
- I'm 10 minutes slow.
- Are the flowers from Mr. Wheaton?
Yes, every hour, on the hour, for a week.
Can you tell us about their romance?
Which of you did she love before Mr. Wheaton?
It was I, but I beat her.
Mr. McGuire. Smile.
- Where's Rusty?
- We want her autograph.
Wait outside. We're trying to rehearse.
- Give me your autograph.
- You don't even know who I am.
Yes, I do.
- You're Rusty Parker's boyfriend.
- I'll tell him when he comes.
You can have my autograph.
Single file. I'll take you first.
You ain't nobody.
Maybe we can catch her out in the alley. Come on!
Just a minute. The girls are too busy to see you.
- Glad to see you.
- Glad to see you.
That's fine, John. Play billiards while my theatre falls apart.
- Good afternoon.
- What's good about it?
It's another day for me to worry about how I'll open my show.
Now I'm sending roses every 15 minutes.
You got me this way. Do something.
I tried everything this side of kidnapping.
What is this side of kidnapping?
Please don't be humorous.
You're humorous, both of you.
You're attempting the impossible:
Lure a girl away from a guy she loves with things.
It won't work, and I'm dame enough to be glad of it. What do you think of that?
I had the same problem with her grandmother. I mean, her mother.
Whose mother?
Nobody's, believe me.
But it can be done.
I want that child on Broadway.
Everything's set and ready to go.
- Frame's built, and no face to go in it.
- You'll have the face. Let me work on it.
Gladly, only work fast, will you? L...
Immediately. Tomorrow night, in fact.
Keep the evening open.
Enter the mastermind.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
All is clear, master.
You may bring forth the treasure.
No photographers, no adoring public.
Zounds, princess, you are slipping.
- Listen to what I'm saying.
- You said Mr. Coudair was sentimental.
I said he can be sentimental on his own time. Then what?
Look.
- Genius, explain it to him.
- Mr. McGuire...
You don't need to explain. You want to skip the show and go to a party.
The second show.
It's an anniversary dinner at Mr. Coudair's house.
- Imagine, eating in a house.
- It's Vanity's 50th birthday.
Why waste good food on an old hag like that?
Will you please stop clowning?
I'm the Golden Wedding Girl, so he wants me there.
And because you work at Danny McGuire's, I want you there.
Do you only think of what you want?
Mr. Coudair has the right to want something.
Once won't hurt. The guy's sentimental.
It can't happen again for 50 years.
You think he'd be sentimental if she worked in Wheaton's show?
He wouldn't. Why should he kick our show around...
...because it's Brooklyn?
- It's not kicking your show around...
...that he's brought you more business because of me than you've had before!
I wondered when that was coming.
That's what the ads read. " Come to
Danny McGuire's to see Rusty Parker."
All the more reason you should be there when they come.
I'll be there, Danny, for the first show.
But after the first show, I'm leaving.
And you can get mad if you want to.
Oh, she's a great kid, always clowning.
You don't think she'd really do that, do you?
Great sense of humour, that kid.
Peace, it's wonderful.
What quieted all of you down?
- Where's Rusty?
- She went to a party.
You should've seen how swell she looked.
Just one word from you, and she does what she likes, doesn't she, boss?
- On stage.
- Just the six of us?
Space it a little. You can cover it.
We will, Danny.
Yeah, great sense of humour, that kid.
You know, Danny, the funniest thing just happened.
Coudair's more sentimental than anybody I heard of. Did you know that?
- Touching.
- He's even sentimental about us.
Yeah, he just phoned. He wants you to come to the party to pick Rusty up.
Imagine that. A guy like him who's got a barrelful of rubies...
...and he's sentimental about a pearl.
I guess he thinks it'd be nice if we were friends.
You have a great brain. Sometimes it almost frightens me, you're so bright.
You know, sometimes it almost frightens me too.
But you're going to the party, aren't you, Danny?
Sure.
Sure, I'm going.
I love parties.
Here's the church, there's the steeple.
Open the door, and where's the people?
I beg your pardon.
Oh, a nursery rhyme.
I beg your pardon.
Yes, sir. Will you come into the study?
Mr. Coudair asked that you be brought right in.
- Nice to see you, Mr. McGuire.
- Nice to see you too, Mr. Coudair.
I guess I'm a little mixed- up.
Your message said Rusty'd be here.
Yes, well, we changed plans at the last minute, and we've...
Won't you sit down and have a drink?
Thanks.
Where is Rusty, Mr. Coudair?
I don't really know.
She and Mr. Wheaton had some sort of an evening figured out, I understand.
This isn't the right direction for Mr. Coudair's house.
You're being kidnapped. You like it?
You're not very complimentary.
You're not scared.
What are you talking about?
Aren't we going to a party?
Sure we are. But I just want to stop by my theatre first for a couple of minutes.
I have kind of a problem that I thought maybe you could help me with.
All right?
Why, I suppose so.
But won't Mr. Coudair wonder where we are?
I don't think so. No.
Beauty like hers demands things,
Mr. McGuire:
Luxury, gentle living, money.
- I have these.
- Are you sure she wants them?
What beautiful young girl doesn't?
Have you given her the chance to make up her own mind?
Have you?
That's fair enough.
Why don't we leave it up to her?
She won't leave you.
She's in love with you.
- I'm in love with her.
- I doubt that.
If you were, you wouldn't let her remain in obscurity.
Don't you think I'd make her go if I thought she'd be happier with...?
No, Mr. Coudair, I don't believe she would be.
I don't believe it for a minute. L...
Beautiful, isn't she?
Yes.
I've never seen that picture before.
Is it new?
That is a picture of Rusty's grandmother, Mr. McGuire.
- I was very much in love with her.
- Well, I'll be darned.
That's exactly what I said to myself when I first saw Rusty.
Amazing resemblance, isn't there?
She was a dancer too, worked at Tony Pastor's.
Tony Pastor's, huh?
It was wrong for her...
...as Danny McGuire's is wrong for her granddaughter.
You decided that right away, huh?
Yes, so I asked her to marry me.
Did she?
Sit down, won't you?
I'll never forget the day I asked her up here to meet my mother.
My mother was society, and Maribelle a girl from the stage.
Maribelle stood there with her chin up and her knees shaking...
...and Mother was looking her over very thoroughly.
Mother just shook her head and said, "Poor John."
I don't suppose you remember a song called "Poor John."
That's how she punished me...
...by singing it until everyone in New York knew that I was "Poor John."
Let me tell you about one night.
I ought to think myself a lucky girl
I know
'Cause I'm engaged
But still somehow
I don't think so
John, that's the name of my finance
You see
There's no mistak e
He's very fond of me
He took me out for walks
And, oh, he was so nice
He always used to kiss me
On the same place twice
Often in the park
We would sit and spoon
And I was, oh, so happy
Till the other afternoon
John took me round to see his mother
His mother
His mother
And when he introduced us
To each other
She weighed up everything that I had on
She put me through a cross-examination
I fairly boiled with aggravation
Then she shook her head
Look ed at me and said:
"Poor John, poor John"
His mother
She put me through a cross-examination
I fairly boiled with aggravation
Then she shook her head
Look ed at me and said:
"Poor John, poor John"
John took you around to see his mother
His mother
His mother
And when he introduced them
To each other
She weighed up everything that I had on
She put her through a cross-examination
I fairly boiled with aggravation
Then she shook her head
And look ed at her and said:
"Poor John, poor John"
She weighed up everything that I had on
She put her through a cross-examination
I fairly boiled with aggravation
Then she shook her head
Look ed at me and said:
"Poor John, poor John"
Hello, Maribelle.
Hello.
I wish you weren't upset about the way Mother...
- She's lived a sort of conventional life.
- Upset?
Why, I'm delighted.
Mr. Pastor's delighted.
The piano player's delighted.
Everybody's delighted.
We think your mother's very intelligent.
Listen, Maribelle, l...
A very intelligent woman. Why, she knows I don't belong on Fifth Avenue.
She knows I belong right here. And now
I do too, not that I didn't know it before.
I don't believe it.
I didn't before and still don't.
Oh, John, dear, we've been through all this before.
But I didn't quite know how right I was until...
I was very uncomfortable in that pile of rock you call a house.
That was because of Mother.
From now on, Mother doesn't exist.
Nothing exists that can come between you and me, do you hear? I...
What's that?
That's him.
He's hard to keep out, isn't he?
Maribelle, listen to me.
I know what he has to offer.
I know what this has to offer.
It's nothing to what I can give you.
He loves you.
But not the way I do. Forty years from now I'll love you more then I do now.
What you have now, you can have a million times.
All the things you tell me are important: Love, fun, music.
If you marry me, you'll have all of them. I promise.
The very best that money can buy.
Now do you understand my interest in Rusty?
It's like my youth has come back after having been away a long, long time.
Who was playing the piano?
A very ordinary, young fellow who worked there.
In love with her.
What difference does that make?
He had nothing to offer her.
Like me.
If you like.
Thanks for a very interesting evening,
Mr. Coudair.
But it's after 1:00, and Rusty'll be waiting at a place we know.
I wouldn't be too sure about that,
Mr. McGuire.
At the risk of repeating myself,
Rusty wants what we have to give her.
Good night, Mr. Coudair.
It certainly is big, isn't it?
You ought to see it when it's filled with 2000 people.
Two thousand?
And look at the orchestra.
We only have six in ours.
What do you do with so much room?
Watching you at McGuire's, I'm amazed how well you handle the space.
I'd think you'd be knocking each other down.
Sometimes we do wish we had a stage as big as this one.
This stage is yours for the asking, Rusty.
My goodness, it must be at least a half a mile wide.
Did you ever dance on a stage as big as this?
It's more like flying than dancing, the freedom of it.
Close your eyes. Go on, close your eyes just to get the feel of it.
Looks like she's not coming, huh, Danny?
Maybe she forgot it was Friday.
Hey, don't be a schlemoil.
Schlemiel.
Beauty lik e Rusty's demands
things, huh?
She loves me. I love her,
and that's all two people need.
Then why didn't she meet you
at the oyster bar tonight?
Something happened.
She'll explain it tomorrow.
Wait a minute, Danny McGuire!
She stood you up, and you know it.
She's out with Wheaton,
and you know that too.
So she's out with Wheaton.
What difference does it mak e?
Danny!
Don't be such a hardheaded Irishman for once.
If you really loved Rusty, you'd let her go.
Coudair's right. You have nothing to give her. Wheaton has everything.
Hey!
Danny!
You can't run away from yourself.
You gotta make up your mind, and I'm gonna see that you do it now.
Wait a minute! Stop!
Hi, Lucy! Am I late?
Can't you see for yourself?
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long...
Danny!
Hello, Rusty!
Yeah?
What's Maurine doing singing my number?
She was here. Maurine, go to the piano and get up on the second A. You're flat.
Okay, Danny.
But you knew I was coming.
Did I? It's a quarter of 11.
Rehearsals are called for 10.
Is 45 minutes something to make a crisis about?
Kind of an amazing thing happened last night, Danny.
It's no use my trying to explain it to you...
...because I can't explain it to me.
I don't suppose you understand what I mean, do you?
Sure we do. It's very clear, isn't it, Danny?
Do you mind if I take care of this my way for a change?
I don't know why you're making a big deal...
You've met so many people, you forgot what I look like.
I'm the man with the whip.
I'm the guy who's got a swell place that means more to me than anything...
...or anybody.
If you're late, Maurine goes in.
She should get up in it...
...because it looks like she'll end up doing it.
You see, to Maurine, this place comes first.
You've hated it ever since
I got to be a cover girl.
You want to be the big shot.
There isn't any room in Danny McGuire's for any big shot.
Well, if you don't want me here, why don't you say so?
If I'm messing up your precious little place, why don't you say so?
I've got someplace to go.
I'm not dependent on...
Why don't you go then?
Okay.
I'm certainly glad I found out you felt this way, Danny, before it was too late.
- You bet I'll go. I've got...
- I know. You told me.
So if you wanna see me again,
Danny McGuire...
...you can just come to Broadway...
...to a big show!
Why don't you cut off your arms and legs and do a good job of it?
Soldiers and civilians
People by the millions
Want to see the perfect cover girl
So I've tak en
Lots of candid-camera shots
Of beauty
My duty
There's nothing lik e perfection
So in that connection
I present my perfect cover girl
Number one I list her
How can I resist her?
I've seen the one I go for
One I've look ed high and low for
Life's not complete
Till I meet that girl on the cover
My problem has me sighing
She k eeps electrifying me
But is she fancy-free?
We'd mak e a team
That could be supreme
With love that's everlasting
It wouldn't be extreme
To call us perfect casting
Love, help a helpless lover
Love, come and help uncover that girl
On the cover for me
I've seen the one I go for
One I've look ed high and low for
Life's not complete
Till I meet that girl on the cover
My problem has me sighing
She k eeps electrifying me
But is she fancy-free?
We'd mak e a team
That could be supreme
With love that's everlasting
It wouldn't be extreme
To call us perfect casting
Love, help a helpless lover
Love, come and help uncover that girl
On the cover for me
I've seen the one I go for
One I've look ed high and low for
Life's not complete
Till I meet that girl on the cover
- Fun tonight, beautiful?
- Lots of fun. It always is.
Glad we ditched
Jackson and Mr. Coudair?
I like them.
You can like somebody and not want to live with them.
- Yes.
- You can't love someone...
...and not want to.
- No.
Can you?
No.
Do you know I've never asked anybody to marry me?
You've missed half your life.
The first half.
I wouldn't like to miss the second half too, Rusty.
Oh, I'm home! I'm always so surprised when I get home so quick.
When I lived in Brooklyn it took...
Okay.
I'm in love with you, Rusty.
But that's no surprise to you, is it?
Not exactly.
I want to marry you.
That's a surprise, isn't it?
I never thought of you as a family man, exactly.
Oh, good heavens, I'm not.
But...
...I don't suppose you're in love with me at all, are you?
I think you're one of the swellest persons
I've ever known.
There's no emotional hangover, is there, Rusty?
I mean, from Brooklyn?
Well, then?
Can I tell you tomorrow?
Okay, beautiful.
If you don't care that I'll age 10 years tonight.
You should be a very distinguished- looking man 10 years from now.
I might even like you better.
I'll tell you tomorrow.
That's all, brother.
This is where you live, beautiful.
Not me.
Lend me your car for a while?
I'll send it back.
Where are you going?
Brooklyn, James.
Cinderella wants to take another peek at the ashes.
Hello, Pop.
Well, Rusty.
Thought I heard a noise down here...
...but I didn't know it was that big noise, Rusty Parker.
How are things, Pop?
I imagine Danny's gotten along all right without me, hasn't he?
He said he could.
- Has he?
- I wouldn't know.
He closed the place up and went away...
...right after you left.
Where is he?
Him and Genius is entertaining at Army camps.
I see.
Well, you needn't look at me like I'd done something.
He closed the place down,
I didn't.
Didn't you?
Give me a drink.
- You've had too many now.
- So I've had too many.
- Give me another one.
- Lf you say so.
Certainly I say so.
And I'm a very big noise, don't you know that?
You've got to run when I say so.
- The toast of the town, huh, Rusty?
- That's right.
But to you, I'm only a crumb, is that it, Joe?
Go ahead, say it.
You're thinking it.
What's the difference?
You're thinking it.
You're a friend of Danny's, aren't you?
Then he told you why he went away, didn't he?
To entertain at Army camps.
Don't let that fool you.
He was sick of Brooklyn.
Well, who isn't?
Rusty! Darling, we've looked all over the place for you.
Oh, hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.
Sit down. Sit down. Right here.
These stools are reserved for my friends.
- Joe, these are my friends.
- Hello, Joe.
My friends are sick of Brooklyn too.
Aren't you sick of Brooklyn?
Noel got worried when you didn't send the car back.
I was scared to death.
I asked John to help me find you.
I didn't know my way around.
Joe, give my friends a drink.
Have a drink.
I was afraid something might have happened to you.
Or that you had decided to stay in Brooklyn.
Me?
Stay in Brooklyn?
Why do you think I'd stay in Brooklyn?
After all I went through to get out of it.
For heaven's sakes, what do you think I am, a vicious circle?
Where's your drink?
Joe, did you know
I was going to get married?
Did you?
Did you?
Well, I am.
- To you.
- Rusty...
Certainly.
This is what I've wanted for me all my life.
Isn't it?
Well...
...l've got it.
- Pay the man.
- Wait a minute, beautiful.
That's the first drink
I ever seen that kid take.
You must have made her awfully happy up there, mister.
That's why I say, do you need money?
See your local finance company.
No questions. No call-makers.
Just leave your eyeball for security.
Now, radio station GI presents a truck-to-truck hookup...
...featuring Red Herring and his gee- but-they're- grand glee club.
Put me
To the test
And I'll climb you the highest mountain
I'll swim you Radio City
Fountain
Put me to the test and I'll get you
A queen's tiara
Or a pyramid from the hot Sahara
- What's that?
- Jazz.
You can dress in sables
At nightclub front tables
If that is what my lady adores
My lady adores
My lady adores
Your eyes, your lips
Your gown, your beautiful eyes
They're driving me mad
I'm going insane
You beautiful lady
You wonderful lady
You...
Sorry.
Test me
Put me on my mettle
How would you lik e a snowball
From Popocatépetl?
How would you lik e some crooning
That's too, too divine?
We'll lull you with a lullaby
That's strictly Hawaiian
Put me to the test
Mak e your request
I'll climb the highest mountain
I'll swim the smallest fountain for you
To the test
- Boy
- Mak e your request
- Hawaiian poi, boy
- I'll go to the Sahara
I'll get a queen's tiara
Oh, murder!
Solid! Jackson! Zoot!
First I promise you
I'll climb the highest mountain
Then for you I'll swim
The Radio City fountain
Though I'm scared of height
And I can't even float
Just put me to the test
And here's what else I'll do quote
Get a snowball right from Popocatépetl
I'll be Hansel if you'll be my Gretel
If we can't please you
Then perhaps my clarinet'll
- Why don't you put me
- Why don't you put me to the test, babe
I'll do the rest, babe
Mak e your request, babe
Anything your heart desires
- An orange from Pomona
- A bronc from Arizona
- Or a Hansel and a Gretel
- Snow from Popocatépetl
- All of this?
- All of this is...
A mountain or a fountain
Or a solid murder, Jackson, or a...
Is yours
Pardon me, may I have the next dance?
No, thanks.
I'm sitting this one out.
- Glad to see you.
- Glad to see you.
What are you trying to do, you...?
- Lady present.
- Lady?
- Ladies?
- Where?
- Where's the lady?
- There she is. Over there.
Oh, there she is again.
Relax. You ain't even in her world, sad sack.
- I can dream, can't I?
- Wake up. She's getting married.
I read it in the paper.
Enter, my lord. Enter.
What have we here?
A tavern?
A likely place, my lord.
A likely place.
- I'll wager the coffee is rancid.
- True, my lord. True.
Joe, how are you?
Am I glad to see you birds.
Where you been anyway?
Military secret.
- The boys look pretty good?
- Plenty good.
Look at them, and you won't worry about who'll be boss over there.
- Well, give out.
- What'll you have?
Oysters!
What do we generally have?
Just the two of you?
Did you bring anyone with you, Genius?
No.
Oysters!
Good old Joe.
He's bald. He's fat. He says "pearls."
He says "oysters." I love him.
You know? I love him too.
- You know why?
- Why?
Because he's dumber than me.
- Dumber than I.
- Okay. He's dumber than both of us.
Here we are.
Well, Joe, here we go again.
You wanna kill the magic?
Come on, pearl.
Well, Joe, what do you hear about anybody?
Rusty, Danny?
Okay, what do you hear about the little redhead?
- She's moved. You know where?
- And if I did...
...she's moving again.
She's getting married.
Tonight, Danny.
Tonight?
Hey, Danny, you found it.
- Found what?
- The pearl, Danny. You found the pearl!
- Nice timing.
- I told you it was a fake.
Sure you did.
- Give me a cup of coffee, will you, Joe?
- Right, Danny.
You see, I'm a genius at everything but minding my own business.
Rusty ought to have that pearl after looking for it for six months.
If she's gonna marry anybody but Danny, she'll need all the luck she can get.
- McGuire know you came here?
- Oh, no.
He'd kick my teeth in if he knew I came here.
Danny's got it figured out that Rusty's happy with what she's got.
He don't wanna mess it up.
- Is she happy?
- Oh, she's very happy.
She lost 10 pounds, but, of course, it's very becoming.
If she thinks about it too much, she can go out and get a little tight...
...which she's doing quite often lately.
You probably know what you're doing.
That was a swell thing those kids had.
I'm glad I'm not the one that broke it up.
I couldn't sleep nights.
Danny will be wondering where I went.
If Pearl there is on her toes, she'll take care of this some way.
How can I get out without passing those people? I'm a back-door character.
Take the door on the left, Genius, and thanks for coming.
Oh, sorry.
I thought you were somebody else.
Well, mastermind?
- What can I do now?
- Don't be so stubborn!
You've made a mistake. Admit it.
You've still got time.
Aren't you even superstitious?
That pearl's magic. You're liable to be struck dead or something.
What pearl's magic?
This one.
Where did you get this?
A person by the name of Genius brought it.
Said a person by the name of Danny found it tonight.
Danny's at Joe's.
I've never seen such a silly-looking pearl in all my life.
- It's all lopsided.
- Lf it's silly, why are you crying?
I'm not crying.
I'm crying because I always cry when people are getting married.
Getting married's awful.
Who ever thought of it in the first place?
Well, we're almost there.
Danny's leaving again tonight.
Oh, but I can't run away now.
Not at the last minute.
Your grandmother could, and did.
What's the matter, your family getting soft?
- My grandmother?
- Go on. Tell her.
Her grandmother got her into this.
It's up to her to get her out.
She ran away from me, Rusty.
At the very last minute.
In this same room.
To this same music.
But she didn't belong with me.
She belonged to her piano-playing boy
who had the right things to give her.
Just as you belong to Danny.
I managed to k eep him away
from the wedding...
... but just closing the door didn't shut
him out, because I made a mistak e.
I forgot to hide the piano.
When she saw that...
... well, she didn't hear
the "Wedding March" anymore.
She only heard their music...
... that I could never learn to play.
Dearly beloved, we have gathered together here in the sight of God...
...and in the presence of this company...
...to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony.
Wilt thou, Noel, have this woman to thy wedded wife...
...so long as ye both shall live?
I will.
And wilt thou, Rusty, have this man to...?
L...
I'm afraid not.
Thank you very much, but...
...my grandmother had the happiest life of any woman ever...
...because she went back to Danny. See?
I mean, she went back where I belong and...
It wouldn't even be nice if I got married to you with this pearl in my hand.
It's got a silly shape, but it's very magic, Noel.
And we'd probably be struck dead, and...
My grandmother was so happy.
Well...
I can't risk getting struck dead, can I?
I think you'd better take that thing and get out of here before it goes off.
It looks loaded to me.
- Goodbye, beautiful.
- Thank you, darling.
Oh! Thank you. Thank you.
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look
And then I knew
That all I...
Let's k eep on singing,
"Mak e way for tomorrow!"
The sun is bringing
A new day tomorrow
Don't let the clouds get you down
Show me a smile, not a frown
Stand up and win! Turn About!
Don't give in! Let's give out!
To the blues, just refuse to surrender
One smile and you
Are a true solid sender
What if it rains and it pours?
It only rains out of doors
Let every frown disappear
And you'll find
That tomorrow's
Here

We're always together
So let come what may
Like brother to brother we're all for each other
The Three Caballeros
Forever we'll stay
Oh!
"Felicitations to Donald Duck... on his birthday, Friday the 13th... from his friends in Latin America."
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
What a pleasant surprise.
Whoops.
Ah, now, isn't that wonderful?
Which one should I open first?
My mama told me to take... this one!
I wonder what's in it.
Oh, boy! Home movies!
Just what I wanted.
Well, well, well.
Well, doggone.
A little penguin.
Oh. What a cute little fella.
Well, what is this?
How do you open this thing, anyway?
On with the show.
The show must go on.
Sí, señor.
That means "strange birds."
Oh, sure, sure.
I know: Birds.
Yes, amigo, your feathered cousins.
You know, Donald, you have more relatives here... than there are coffee beans in Brazil.
For instance, take the one who lives way, way down...
But suppose we let my friend
Professor Holloway tell us about it.
From the beginning to...
El fin, the end.
Yes. Thank you.
Professor?
This story takes us way down to the South Pole.
Rather than have you stand on your heads... let's turn the theater over.
There. That's better.
Two things you will find most of down here... are ice and penguins.
It's amazing that anybody would want to live here... but most penguins wouldn't live anywhere else.
You couldn't find better weather for fishing... skiing, tobogganing... or swimming.
And there is nothing the average penguin likes better... than a day at the beach.
Uh, but come on.
Let's meet Pablo.
He lives down at the end of Main Street.
Let's go in and see what's cookin'.
Pablo could never remember having been warm enough... and so his closest companion was SmokeyJoe... his little stove.
Between chills,
Pablo had one burning desire... to spend the rest of his life on some tropical shore.
So we see him bravely set forth for the isle of his dreams.
The other penguins turned out to give him a big send-off.
But when he gets just so far away from his stove...
See what happens?
Too bad.
Perhaps he'll give up this wild idea.
But no.
He's off to another start.
This time he's bringing a friend.
Anyway, it was a hot idea.
Well, maybe he'll be content to stay at home this time.
But no!
There he goes... hotfooting it to the land of the sun.
By now, the farewell committee has been reduced to two.
Discouraging, isn't it?
Suddenly,
Pablo got one of those ideas... that change a person's whole life: A boat.
But where would he get a boat?
Just watch.
Where there's a will, there's a way, they say.
And now, the official launching.
Day after day, the south wind carried him north.
One day, a blanket of fog rolled in... and it was so thick...
Must be near Cape Horn.
As the fog lifted... he found himself headed straight through the Straits of Magellan... and northward along Chile's rocky coast.
One day, a storm cloud came up... just a little bitty old storm cloud, though... and just tried awful hard to have its first storm.
Didn't amount to much, though.
One day on lookout,
Pablo had a bit of a shock... a waterspout off the port bow!
But it proved to be theJuan Fernandez Islands... where Robinson Crusoe once lived... and still does, apparently.
Four bells and all's well.
According to Pablo's chart, he should be nearing Vina Del Mar.
And strangely enough, that's just where he is.
He sailed past Lima, capital of Peru... hugging the coastline with a tenacity of purpose... seldom found in a penguin.
One day his telescope picked out a city... high up on top of a mountain.
The map said it was Quito... and it was right smack on the equator.
It wasn't as easy to cross... but with a little help from Neptune, he made it.
So, making a left turn, he followed the equator... headed for the Galapagos Islands.
Ah, that good old sun.
Pablo felt that he'd never get enough of it.
Oh, he hadn't counted on this.
Things looked pretty bad.
Help! Man the pumps!
She's sprung a leak!
Pipe all hands on deck!
Do things! Get going!
Take to the lifeboats!
Abandon ship!
Unruffle the mizzenmast and man the poops!
And, well, don't just stand there.
Get going!
Swab the decks, and...
Heavens.
Look! What's that?
Just what he's been looking for.
Pablo has finally reached the isle of his dreams.
And so, as the warm tropical sun... sinks slowly in the west... we leave little Pablo, a bird in paradise... a picture of health in his new coat of tan.
He should be the happiest penguin in the world.
Only sometimes... he gets to thinking...
Never satisfied.
Well, that's human nature for you... even if you're a penguin.
You're absolutely right.
And now, Donald, let's hop over the Andes.
From these snowcapped peaks to the depths of the Amazon jungle... one finds many more strange and exotic birds.
Like the anambepreto of Colombia and Venezuela.
He carries his own bagpipes hidden under his beard.
Then there's his cousin, the arapapa... pride of Paraguay, whose perfect appearance... permits his pompous pride in his pompadour.
And la tijereta, the scissors bird... the Colombian cutup.
Then there's the arapacu de pico curvo.
He's always sticking his nose into things.
Did you ever see such a freak beak, huh?
Speaking of beaks, what a time two toucans have making love.
When they're beak to beak, they can't get cheek to cheek.
Because when one toucan turns his head... only one toucan can.
Uh-oh. Who's that?
Oh, a thousand pardons.
Señor Donald, I would like to have you meet... one of the most eccentric birds you have ever seen.
His name is the aracuan.
You'll find him most everywhere.
Eh, glad to know ya.
Pleased to meet ya.
Now, he's called the aracuan... because of the peculiar song he sings... which sounds something like this.
By the way, amigo, did you know some birds are skilled craftsmen?
Uh-uh. Is that so?
Yes. Quite a builder is the little marrequito.
His nest may look haphazard in design... ah, but every single stick and straw... is scientifically placed to withstand... the stress and strain of... well, almost anything.
Literally dotted are the shores of many tropical marshes... with the brilliant plumage of the flamingo.
And now, Donald, how would you like to hear a story... about another bird so amazing you won't believe it?
Oh, sure. You bet.
It's a tale told by an old gaucho from Uruguay.
Listen.
It was early one morning in springtime... just as day was beginning to break.
As the sun came up over the...
Oh, but I am forgetting my story.
It was silent out there on the pampas.
Only one little bird was awake.
From his nest came the little hornero to see if the...
Oh, say, do you know why this bird's called the hornero?
- No?
- Uh-uh. Why?
You see, his nest is just like the horno.
That's the oven where we bake our bread and our...
Oh, oh, oh, you know who that is?
That's me, when I was a little gauchito.
Many, many years ago, of course.
And why was I up so early?
Because I was going out hunting all alone.
First I put on my bombachas and tied on my chiripá.
Then I slipped into my new botas.
And I put my boleadoras where I could reach them in a hurry.
¡Gauchito.!
Not forgetting my hunting knife.
And now I was ready to go.
Now, the best place to hunt the wild ostrich... is out on the wide open plains... on the broad, flat land of the...
Flat land?
Say, what am I doing here?
Oh, now I remember.
This day I was hunting for condor birds high up in the mountains.
While looking around for the condors,
I climbed to the top of a rock.
No, come to think of it, it was a tree.
Let's see, maybe it was a rock after all.
Although I could swear it was a tree.
Oh, what's the difference?
Let it go. Let it go.
My sharp eyes soon discovered the nest of a...
Psst! ¡Gauchito.!
The nest.
I could tell from the wings he was... he was a least five meters from tip to tip.
The biggest condor bird in all of... ¡Caramba.!
What's this?
I couldn't believe my eyes.
No, it couldn't be.
But there it was.
I was looking face to face with a flying donkey.
The donkey bird didn't seem bashful.
He flew right up close to...
Quick, Gauchito.!
Now! Get him, quick!
Aha. Got him.
Now, now. Easy, easy.
This donkey should be worth a fortune.
I couldn't let him get away.
So I made up my mind that I'd catch him if it took me the rest of...
Now I had him!
Hold him, Gauchito.!
Ride him, cowboy!
He acted just like he was loco, but I was an expert, of course.
He thought he could throw this gauchito... but he soon found out who was the boss.
Psst, Gauchito.!
Who is the boss?
I decided to train him for racing... far out where nobody could see...
'cause I planned to win thousands of pesos... for this little burrito and me.
I made brilliant plans for the future.
We'd live like a couple of kings... and I'd be the world's richest gaucho... with my hands full of big diamond rings.
¡Ah, macanudo.!
Okay.
This burrito was tame as a kitten.
He was learning new tricks every day.
You should see how he begged for my mate.
He liked it much better than hay.
Then we soon fell asleep by the campfire.
We both were as tired as could be... and tomorrow was very important... for little Burrito and me.
For this was the day of fiesta.
The gauchos were happy and gay.
They danced the zamba and gatos... and gambled their pesos away.
While the crowd sang and danced in the plaza...
I just stood in the shade of a tree...
and watched them toss coins at the sapo.
But this game meant nothing to me.
Some others were rolling the bochas and betting on games of this kind.
But I didn't join in these pastimes.
I had something bigger in mind.
- ¡Ay, caballo.!
- The race was about to begin... and the grand prize was 1,000 pesos.
The gauchos were howling with laughter... when they saw us come out on the track.
I whispered,
"Remember the wings, Burrito."
Oh-oh-oh-oh!
Not yet! Not yet!
The gauchos and horses were all on their toes.
We were off with the speed of a bullet.
We flew down the track like the wind.
Every gaucho was, uh, uh...
Meanwhile, Burrito and I were, uh, uh, jockeying for position.
¡Gauchito.!
They went that way.
That way.
No wonder they laughed.
I didn't even look like a jockey.
Hey, Gauchito.
Come on.
Look like a jockey.
Pepito, the pride of Mendoza, was setting a furious pace... and Fuego, Gordito and Pingo, you never have seen such a race.
Now it's Pepito and Fuego.
It's Fuego and Pepito.
And there comes Gordito on the rail.
Do your stuff, kid.
No?
Well, don't wait too long or...
Look out!
Ah-heh.
What did I tell you?
Come on, Gauchito.
The wings, the wings.
Quickly I untied the rope.
Come on, come on.
Quickly I untied the rope.
The knife! The knife!
¡Córtalo, córtalo.!
And now we go.
You should see little Burrito... tearing up the track, so fast you couldn't see us.
And now down the home stretch comes
Fuego. Now Pepito's ahead on the rail.
Here comes Pingo, Gordito and Gato, and Dorado is right on his tail.
But where is Burrito?
Here comes Burrito!
We passed them like they were standing still.
And now coming down across the line of finish, it's Burrito, the winner!
Well, amigos, it was all over but the shouting...
I thought.
Caramba.
The jig was up.
And what became of the flying donkey, you ask?
Neither him nor me was ever seen again... as long as we lived.
Adios, amigo.
Adios. So long!
Good-bye!
What's going on here?
Presents! Oh, boy!
Let me at 'em!
Say, what's this?
Ah, Pato Donald.
Or, as you Americans say, what's cookin'?
Joe Carioca!
Well, I'll be doggoned!
Imagine meeting me here.
Donald, have you ever been to Baía? No?
- No, I haven't.
- Ah, Baía.
Land of romance... moonlight, music, beautiful girls.
Oh, forgive the interruption,
Donald.
This crazy bird is the aracuan.
He's meio maluco, a very stupid fellow.
But tell me, Donald, have you ever been to Baía?
- No, I haven't.
- No? Oh...
I am so sorry for you.
Ah, Baía.
It is like a song in my heart.
A song with love... and beautiful memories.
I close my eyes, and I can see it now.
I can see the beautiful twilight in the sky.
I can feel the breeze from the bay... and I can hear the music, the music of Baía.
When twilight is deep in the sky
Someone that I long to see
Keeps haunting my reverie
And so the loneliness deep in my heart
Calls to you
Calls to you
I live in the memory of
Many dreams ago
When the stars were bright
And you were mine alone
My love for you cannot die
Though the oceans run dry
Or heaven falls from the sky
Now you're gone
Can't you hear my lonely call
Morena
Make my life complete again
How I pray for the day
When I'll see your smile
And my heart will beat again
When twilight is deep in the sky
Someone that I long to see
Keeps haunting my reverie
And so the loneliness deep in my heart
Calls to you, calls to you
Ah, Baía.
Beautiful Baía.
Oh, forgive me, but have you been to Baía, Donald?
- No.
- No? Well, let's go.
If you go to Baía, my friend... you'll never return.
Have you been to Baía, Donald
- Uh-uh.
- Well, let's go
- They have vatapá
- What's that?
- They have caruru
- Is that so?
- They have munguzá
- Munguzá?
- Do you like to samba
- Oh, sure.
- Have you been to Baía, Donald
- No.
Well, let's go
When you go to Baía, my friend
You'll never return
Have you been to Baía?
- No.
- No? Well, let's go!
Hurry, Donald! Hurry!
Well, well. Here we are in Baía, land of romance.
Baía? Where is Baía?
We are in Baía.
Look.
Well, I'll be doggoned.
- Who's that?
- Donald, that's Yayá.
- Who's Yayá?
- Ah, a baiana.
Donald, quindins de Yayá.
She sells cookies.
Cookies, my friend.
Donald!
- Hello.
- i Como vai!
Hi, toots.
What?
- Who is that guy?
- Oh, he's a malandro, Donald.
Oh, boy!
This Donald!
Did you ever see such a fast worker?
No, no, Donald.
Take it easy.
Look.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
Come on, boys.
What do you feel about Baía, huh?
Tell me the truth.
Oh, swell! Marvelous!
Romance.
Moonlight.
Beautiful girls.
Or as you say, you are a wolf.
Take it easy.
You have more presents.
Presents?
Whee! Presents!
What? Oh! Oh!
Oh, I'm a midget!
Oh!
You, you're a midget too!
Oh-ho, Donald!
Don't worry.
It is simple, my friend.
Just a little black magic will fix you up.
Believe it or not, it is very simple!
You are very funny fellow!
Oh, my, my, my, my, my, my!
You kill my head!
- Huh?
- Oh, my friend... you are using the wrong finger.
Now, blow!
- Thanks, pal!
- B-B-B-But, Donald, your presents!
My presents!
Aha, my friends!
Welcome to Mexico.
Son of a gun, it's a pleasure to see such fine gentlemen in Mexico.
Here, amigos.
Donald!
José.
¡Caramba.!
Now we're three gay caballeros.
We're three caballeros
Three gay caballeros
They say we are birds of a feather
We're happy amigos
No matter where he goes
The one, two and three goes
We're always together
We're three happy chappies with snappy serapes
You'll find us beneath our sombreros
We're brave and we'll stay so
We're bright as a peso
- Who says so?
- We say so
The Three Caballeros
We have the stars to guide us
Guitars here beside us
To play as we go
We sing and we samba
We shout, Ay, caramba
- What means "ay, caramba"?
- Oh, yes. I don't know.
Through fair or stormy weather
We stand close together
Like books on a shelf
And pals though we may be
When some Latin baby says yes, no, or maybe
Each man is for himself
- What's this?
- What's this?
This is your gift from Mexico, Donald:
A piñata.
Oh, boy, oh, boy! A piñata!
What's a piñata?
A piñata is full of surprises, presents.
It is the very spirit of Christmas.
Christmas?
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all...
No, no, Donald.
For goodness sake.
Not "Jingly Bells."
In Mexico, they sing
"Las Posadas."
This custom takes place on each of the nine days before Christmas.
Each evening, the children gather at the village church... and form a procession symbolizing the journey of Mary and Joseph... from Nazareth to Bethlehem.
The little ones carry images of the saints from house to house...
singing a plea for shelter, or posada.
A reply comes from within:
"No posada. No shelter."
Looking sad and downhearted, they try again... but the reply is still the same.
"No shelter. No posada."
They repeat this song time after time... and always they are refused.
Until at last they reach a friendly house and the door is opened.
"Come in, come in, holy pilgrims.
This humble home is yours."
And now, Mary and Joseph have found shelter at last.
Then the rejoicing begins... the feasting, the celebrating... and finally the biggest surprise of all:
Breaking the piñata.
And now for your piñata, Donald.
Here you are.
Go to it.
One side, boys. One side.
I'm gonna smack it!
Uh-uh, no, hold it.
Ho-Hold it, Donald.
First you must be blindfolded.
We have to put this over your eyes.
That's part of the tradition.
Now, now, now, stand here.
Come here now.
Hit it hard.
All right, let's see you smack it.
Just a minute.
Uh-oh. Aha!
You see, Donald? Didn't I told you it was full of surprises?
Did you know that the history of Mexico is in her flag?
Oh, yes! You see, many hundreds of years ago, the god of the Aztecs... commanded them to build a big city where they would find an eagle destroying a serpent.
But when they find this eagle, he was sitting on a cactus on top of a rock... way out in the middle of a lake.
¡Caramba.! To build a city here would be almost imposible.
But they built and built and built some more... until today, believe it or not, the lake is full of Mexico City.
Sweet music
Gay serenatas
Tropic skies
Of velvet blue
Magic gardens
Perfume the breezes
Where true love
Brought me to you
Mexico
With all your romance
Your song oflove
Will live forever after
Mexico
Sweethearts are singing
Lovebirds are winging
Through a sky filled with laughter
Paradise
That's where I found you
Your magic smile
Made the blossoms bloom around you
Mexico
Why do I feel as I do
I simply fell
Under the spell
Of you
- ¡Oba.! ¡Oba.! Nice! Oh, boy!
- Wow!
Ah, but this is only the beginning, amigos. Take a look at this one.
Oh, boy!
What a pretty picture!
And now, for a nice little trip through Mexico... on the magic serape.
- All aboard, amigos.
- Oh, what's goin' on here?
Paradise
That's where I found you
Your magic smile
Made the blossoms bloom around you
Mexico
Why do I feel as I do
I simply fell
Under the spell
Of you
Of you
And this, Donald, is Patzcuaro... a fisherman's paradise.
Yeah! Beautiful!
Oh, boy! Would I like to come back sometime... and do a little fishing.
Uh-oh!
- What's going on here?
- Shh!
This is my favorite dance, the "jarabe pateño."
Doggone it!
I can't get it.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no, boys!
You are off the beat.
This is the way.
Well, what do you know?
Thanks.
I had a wonderful time.
So long!
This is the way they dance in Veracruz.
It's called the "lilongo."
Hi, girls!
May I cut in?
Watch your step, Donald!
Some fun, hey, kid?
So you like dancing, huh?
- Okay.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Go on, Donald.
Don't be afraid.
Not so fast, boys.
Go on in, Donald.
Don't be bashful.
Hi, toots!
Am I intruding?
Hey, Donald, you are what they say, off the cob!
- You know, corny.
- Oh, yeah?
Swing me with that boogie beat, Joe!
How am I doin', toots?
Come on, let me down.
- I wanna stay!
- Take it easy, Donald.
There she is...
Acapulco Beach... the Riviera of Mexico.
Take the telescope and have a look at what you might call the hot stuff.
Oh, boy! Am I going to like this place.
Oh, boy! Hot stuff!
I'll be right down, toots.
- Hello, my sweet little bathing beauties.
- Donald! Donald!
We're three caballeros
Three gay caballeros
They say we are birds of a feather
Where's Donald?
Aha! I am a son of a gun. Look at the little wolf in duck's clothings.
Come to Papa.
Wha-What's going on here?
Come here, you little rascals.
Now I've got ya. Uh-oh.
Doggone this confusion!
Oops! Where is she?
Come here, my little enchilada.
I've got you this time, tootsie.
Peek-a-boo.
I see you.
Hey, where am I?
My, my, my!
Ain't this fun?
Here I come!
This time I'm gonna get you!
Oh, no, no, no, Donald!
Don't do that!
Let me go. Get me outta here!
You can't do this to me.
Get your hands off of me!
This is a free country.
Bye-bye!
So you like pretty girls, huh?
Let's go!
- Let me go!
- Don't ruffle your feathers, Donald!
Look, I will show you the nightlife of Mexico City.
- Beautiful, no?
- Colossal!
Oh, boy! Mexico City?
Very beautiful city.
Careful, Donald.
Even the sky is full of romantic!
You belong to my heart
- She's beautiful!
- Now and forever
- And our love had its start
- Oh, boy!
Not long ago
We were gathering stars
While a million guitars played our love song
When I said "I love you" every beat of my heart
- Oh, boy, oh, boy.
- Said it too
'Twas a moment like this
Do you remember
And your eyes threw a kiss
When they met mine
Now we own all the stars
And a million guitars are still playing
Darling, you are the song
And you'll always belong to my heart
'Twas a moment like this
- Do you remember
- Uh-huh.
And your eyes threw a kiss
- When they met mine
- Don't do that!
Now we own all the stars
And a million guitars are still playing
Darling, you are the song
And you'll always belong to my heart
You belong
To my heart
Now and forever
Three caballeros
Three gay caballeros
Three caballeros
Three gay caballeros
When I said "I love you"
Every beat of my heart said it too
- Some fun, hey, kid?
- Some fun, hey, kid?
Some fun, hey, kid?
We're three caballeros
Three gay caballeros
They say we are birds of a feather
We're happy amigos
No matter where he goes
The one, two and three goes
We're always together
Darling, you are the song
And you'll always belong to my heart
Pretty girls. Pretty girls.
Pretty girls. Pretty girls.
What? Oh, boy!
Uh-oh.
Uh, what's happening, anyway?
Where am I?
Uh-oh!
My, my!
Uh-oh.
What?
What?
What?
Come on, torito, give it to me!
What's the matter with you?
Are you color-blind?
Come on, bull. You bashful?
Oh, through fair or stormy weather
We're always together
So let come what may
Like brother to brother we're all for each other
The Three Caballeros
Forever we'll
Stay
All right, break it up.
Get back. Get moving.
What happened?
All right, move along.
Make mine a scotch and soda, double.
What about you?
- I'll have a root beer.
- Root beer?
Well, it's your liver, my friend.
Night desk?
About that shooting... the guy that was shot, his name is Leonard Moss.
M- O- double "S."
As in "Sam," yeah.
Hold it.
Let's have another, same thing.
He was in a crap game.
Uh, hold it.
- Hey, you all right?
- I just never saw a stiff before.
No? Well, I always thought newspaper reporters...
This is my first day at it.
Okay, I'll call you later.
Ernie wants us to stick around awhile just in case.
- You all right?
- I'm all right.
It's probably that stuff you're drinking. How about bringing that bottle?
- All right.
- Another thing you've got to remember about newspaper work...
The public always expects a newspaperman to do a lot of drinking... and so you mustn't ever let the public down.
- You think this story will make the front page?
- Be lucky to get in at all.
One dice hustler shoots another dice hustler. So what?
They don't seem to have the murders these days like they used to.
Different class of people, I guess.
What's the matter with this crate?
That thing ain't worked in 10 years.
L- I don't suppose there's any connection...
but we haven't had a real good juicy murder story in this town... since the Democrats got hold of the country.
Back under the Republicans...
Well, how do you like that?
Ten years?
That's more like 15.
Yeah.
# Mine in May, His in June #
# She forgot mighty soon #
1927. Remember that?
Yeah. Uh-huh.
#There they go in their joy #
# Happy girl, lucky boy #
#And here am I #
# Brokenhearted ##
That's what I mean. That's the song they sang for Roxie Hart.
- And was that a story.
- What was?
Roxie.
- Customers.
- All right. I'll get 'em.
I'll get 'em. Hello, boys.
Charge your glasses, gentlemen.
To Roxie Hart... the prettiest woman ever tried for murder in Cook County.
Okay, partner.
To Roxie Hart.
To Roxie Hart.
Well, what about her?
- You remember that story?
- Yeah, some of it.
the bad old days when everything went and everything was big... big money, big crooks, big murders, big stories.
- "Keep cool with Coolidge. "
"Keep cockeyed with Capone. "
"Keep daffy with Daddy Browning. "
This seems to call for a spot of music, and serve everybody a round on me.
What about Roxie Hart?
Roxie Hart, the Teapot Dome,
The 18th Amendment, the Monkey Trial, Carl Wanderer...
Texas Guinan, Mayor Thompson.
#The black bottom #
# Black bottom #
Hall-Mills, Judd Gray and Ruth Snyder.
I wanna hear what you got to say about Roxie Hart.
Why not?
That was the best of them all.
That was all of them rolled into one...
15 years ago...
and I remember it like it was yesterday.
That first flash of a shooting.
The police?
This is Finnegan... the janitor at 1442 South Melrose.
Somebody just shot somebody in apartment six!
And I make this statement voluntarily... and of my own free will.
Freely and gladly.
I fired five shots into the man...
- Smack into him.
- Killing him instantly.
Like a dog.
- Cheerful little assassin.
- Assassin?
Is it assassination to shoot a burglar?
What would you do if you came home and found somebody banging on the bedroom door?
- Check on the wife.
- But she wasn't here, I tell you.
Wasn't nobody here.
I come home from the poolroom and...
You know,
I'm the best snooker player down there.
- Yeah. And as I go...
- Come on. Come on. Sign it.
He ain't tryin' the case.
He's just a reporter.
Not bad, huh? One hour, and we got the guy and a signed confession.
Last week, a jury thanked a man for killing a burglar.
This week, they're giving a Hupmobile.
- Where do you think the madam could be?
- The what?
- The wife.
- The movies, maybe.
Let's go outside and have a talk with the prosecutor.
Say, is he trying to insinuate something?
- How do you look at this thing?
- That's my wife. She's artistic.
I'll never see anything that reminded me less of Whistler's Mother.
- Everybody through with this?
- It's all yours, Doctor.
I believe that if everybody would love everybody else...
Okay, Billy Sunday, let's go.
Yeah. Well, that's about all it is,
I'm afraid... routine 12-B.
Yeah.
Joe theJerk defends the little nest...
while Miss Flapper Wife is out mooning overJohn Gilbert.
Okay, Tommy.
See you later.
How do?
Oh, no, you don't!
I want to have a couple of words with you. That's all I want.
Oh! Oh, hey! Cut it out, will ya?
- I only want to say a word...
- Let me go!
Oh, no.
Will you cut it out?
I'm not a copper!
- What are you?
- I'm a newspaperman.
Oh!
- All right!
- Let me go!
Oh, no!
There's a cop there, lady.
You want me to call him or not?
- What do you want?
- I want the story.
I want you to tell me what really happened in here.
- You heard him. I was...
- Don't give me that.
You weren't skinnying around the outside of this building for your health.
- Come on, let's have it.
- You let me go!
- You plugged him, didn't you?
- Are you batty?
Come on. What are you scared of?
They won't do anything to you.
This county never does anything to a dame.
Cook County is the most gallant county in the whole country.
Why, a pretty murderess is as safe here... as she is in her mother's arms.
What do you want me to do, say I shot him when I didn't?
- Oh, no, you're not. Come here.
- Let me go.
Cut it out, will you?
You do that again, I'll break your arm.
No, uh, uh, uh!
No more billy goats either.
Oh, please let me go. I didn't do it.
I swear I didn't. He shot him!
But why did he shoot him?
Because he busted in and caught you.
He didn't have to bust in.
The door was open.
Oh, mercy me. Mercy me.
Bring the body back in the parlor.
- We gotta get outta here.
- Oh, no! Cut it out. Look, honey.
You and me is gonna have a nice little talk.
Look, honeysuckle, you get right in there... and Daddy will be back in just a few minutes.
We met this gentleman downstairs.
He says he knows the stiff.
Who are you?
E. Clay Benham at your service... of Benham and Casely, theatrical booking agents.
That is... or that was my partner, the late Mr. Casely.
I don't want to seem crude, but I'd like somebody to make up their mind about these remains.
He wasn't no midget, remember.
You positively identify this man?
- Gladly. That is, naturally.
- Take it away.
Just ring twice anytime.
Service with a smile.
- What do you know about this?
- Very little, I'm afraid.
- I didn't even know that Roxie was married.
- Roxie?
Mrs. Hart. She was a client of ours in a way of speaking.
- We weren't able to place her.
- What particular talent was she peddling?
She described herself, I believe, as a dancer.
I don't believe it.
She wouldn't lie to me like that.
She was here washing the dishes all the time.
My dear fellow, it's a matter of record.
She's been on Mr. Casely's doorstep for weeks.
Only this afternoon, she insisted on another audition.
And she told me she'd never seen him before.
Never seen him before in her life!
A complete stranger!
She, uh, liked Mr. Casely?
Well, let us say, rather, that Mrs. Hart was ambitious and female.
- A coquette.
- The word is nicely chosen.
Mr. Casely was responsive to her appeal?
Fred was a man who was always sensitive to a well-turned ankle.
A wolf?
De mortuis nil nisi bonum.
- Yeah. A wolf.
- But why?
- Is Roxie the one that plugged him?
- She is!
Why should I try to protect her?
What should I take the rap when all the time she was lying to me?
I bring her to Chicago, I get her a job and this is what she does to me.
I wasn't even in the room.
I was coming up them stairs when "bang, bang, bang. "
There she was with the rod in her hand and him folding up right there.
Well! Well, this is a little more like it!
And all the time,
I'm trying to believe her.
I'm trying to make myself believe her because I wanted to believe her.
- Where is she now?
- On the roof, hiding.
- Excuse me.
- Downstairs. Cover the building.
You come with me.
On the Hart story, a perfectly lovely situation has developed.
Joe theJerk has now pinned it on the little woman.
- I want to issue a statement.
- Oh, hold it, Tommy.
You're not going to change your mind again, I hope.
Why, you liar!
I didn't do it! Let me out ofhere!
Hold it, Tommy, they're coming through the walls.
Boy, it is Mrs. Hart.
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Take it easy, will you, honey?
You don't want to damage your defense.
- Nothing doing down here.
- All right. Help the sergeant up here.
- I'll watch the fire escape.
- Okay.
Keep this wire open, Tommy.
Santa Claus is coming.
- Wait till I get my hands on that dirty double-crosser. - Will you pipe down?
- Double-crossing me...
- Here's your lead. Roxie Hart...
the prettiest woman ever charged with murder in this county...
has just surrendered to a representative of the Gazette.
- While the constabulary...
- All you got to do is to sign this.
- The cops are still on the roof.
- Did you hear what he said?
What?
You really think I'm so, uh, pretty, like you said?
Honey, you are a garden of hollyhocks.
- How old are you, dear?
- Eighteen.
Roxie is 23 and red-headed.
Listen, old boy. Let me get the girl signed up before those monkeys get back here.
- All right. Hold it, Tommy.
- What's that?
All you got to do, my dear, is to sign this contract.
What contract?
This is just a blank piece of paper.
- Not even any fine print on it.
- I'll fill that in later.
Cabarets, personal appearance, everything!
We'll clean up!
Unless, of course, you swing.
What is this... the insane asylum?
You're beginning to give me the creeps.
You're not gonna swing.
Women don't swing in this county.
And will you stop saying "swing"?
Listen, Roxie.
You are a very lucky girl.
Today you are nobody, and who cares?
Tomorrow money couldn't buy the publicity you'll have... column after column of it.
Pictures, measurements, what you eat, what you drink... how you feel when you get up in the morning, advice to young girls.
- On the radio.
- Everybody in the country will know you.
They'll fight to see you.
Like when you cross the sidewalk... from the patrol wagon to the courtroom door.
They'll want your autograph.
They'll grab your clothes for souvenirs.
They'll wanna kiss you so they can tell their grandchildren.
A million-dollar production, and you're the star.
I'm telling you, you'll be right up there with Peaches Browning...
William Jennings Bryan,
Queen Marie, Ma Ferguson.
- Mutt and Jeff.
- Red Grange, Ruth Snyder...
Aimee Semple McPherson,
Barney Google.
Don't you understand, dear?
This is Chicago, the city of opportunity.
And that city only awaits one word from you to be at your feet.
Well, maybe I'm crazy.
- Listen, you...
- Let me out of here, please.
Are you going to throw away a veritable fortune?
How am I going to spend that fortune in a cemetery?
You won't have to, I tell ya.
- Who's going to stop it... you?
- Billy Flynn.
- Billy Flynn?
- You mean the great mouthpiece?
Get Billy Flynn, and you can write your own ticket.
- Yes, and use it.
- The streets of the city are congested with women... that Billy has saved from their just desserts.
Well, do you think he'd take me?
Honey, Willy would take an ape-woman if there was enough publicity in it.
He's good-looking too, isn't he?
Sex appeal rises from him like a cloud of steam.
- But you don't think there'd be any...
- Honey, I keep telling you... this county wouldn't hang
Lucrezia Borgia.
I wouldn't want to get in any jam.
It's money from home.
That's the only way to describe it.
You don't think that... all this you said about my career... you don't think I could have it if I was innocent?
- Oh, Roxie, please.
- Oh, Roxie, please, will ya?
Well, then... of course.
Naturally, I want to do everything I can for my career.
All right, honey.
What's her name? Roxie?
All right, Roxie. Give it to us big.
Give us plenty of teeth.
The old smiling face.
And fine, hold it. Go!
Wonderful! Wonderful!
Now, let's see.
If I'd known this in time,
I'd have got a marcel.
This will be a nifyy, though.
Head up. That's fine.
You got her in focus, boys?
Get the orchid in.
This is wonderful.
Wonderful. Love it.
- Is that her?
- Yeah. Pip, huh?
But she's just a girl... like me.
H... How's that?
I thought she'd be older and... more sinful-looking.
She's... She's beautiful.
Listen. I don't want any of this to get in the newspapers.
I want the whole thing kept perfectly quiet.
Sure, sure. You're too smart a guy.
Step right over here.
Oh, no.
You ain't gonna drag me into this.
You're already drug, you dope.
Stop stalling and get over there.
- We gotta catch the main edition.
- I won't do it!
There you are.
No spirit of cooperation.
Listen. You want people to think you're a yellow dog and ran out on your wife?
- A low, dirty bum.
- What else is he?
Show the world you're gonna stand by her through thick and thin.
The old bulldog spirit for the woman I love. How 'bout it, kid?
Why, with a man like you at her side... a woman could fight the whole world... lefty.
- Well, naturally, if I thought...
- Atta boy!
We'll send you a copy to hang in your den with the rest of your trophies.
- What about the stiff?
- The corpse?
No corpse is gonna pose with me.
Especially that one. Count me out.
Get back, honey.
The stiff is gone.
- It's enough with that.
- We don't need the stiff.
- Hey, Fido. Lay down. Play dead.
- Here?
Yeah.
You, right over here now.
Try and unloosen.
That's fine.
Beautiful. Beautiful.
All right, everybody, big smile.
Beautiful.
- How's this pose? Is this a good one?
- The knees, babe.
How about a profile?
I hate to lose any part of that kisser, but let me see.
Good.
You're asking his forgiveness.
Who's asking whose forgiveness?
- Look, Roxie. Cooperate.
- The knees, the knees.
I don't know why
I want to get mixed up in this.
You move out of there, and I'll bat you one, so help me.
I'll give you such a rap...
Roxie, you're begging his forgiveness.
Husband, you're smiling sweetly.
Counselor, look official.
That's it. Hold it, everybody.
The knees, Roxie, the knees!
That's the way it started... small.
But, brother, how it grew.
In one week, Roxie Hart was the best-known dame in the United States.
Her fame covered this whole country like the morning dew.
Like the dew.
The prettiest woman ever charged with murder in the history of Chicago.
Pretty soft, huh?
That's the way it looked, yeah.
Like a setup, a pushover. No risk, no danger, no chance of a conviction.
That's the way it looked then.
That's what she thought.
Do you seriously think Billy Flynn is going to waste his time... on every two-bit scuffle that gets into the papers?
Two-bit scuffles? Eight pictures and nine columns in two days.
I guess that ain't the bee's knees.
My dear girl, do you realize that during my first week here...
I had a total of 15 pictures...
271/2 columns and an editorial denouncing me?
- You're so awful, it's all I can do to keep my mind on you.
- Children!
To hear you talk, you'd think you were queen of the jail.
Well, permit me to remind you,
Miss Sloppy... your whole case is a very low-class affair...
whereas my friend...
- was in the social register.
- On a pass?
In my opinion, Mrs. Hart, you're a very ordinary bum, and you might as well face it.
Bum? I'll "bum" you!
Ooh!
Children.
You girls have got to stop this squabbling.
Let's see.
Where was I?
Altogether, Mr. Benham and I managed to raise $ 1,400 off the furniture.
Never mind how, just count it out.
Then there's 500 from the savings...
- and 500 from Roxie's life insurance.
- That's 2,400.
Three hundred that I borrowed, and 700 from the building and loan.
- That's 3,400.
- And that's all.
- All?
- All so far.
I figured I could pay you, say, 20 a week.
I could give you interest.
Maybe double interest.
Now just a minute, Hart.
When you came to me... and said,
"Mr. Flynn, will you take this case?"
Did I say,
"Is she innocent or is she guilty?"
No. I said nothing like that.
I simply said, "Have you got $5,000?"
Didn't I?
That's right.
You've been perfectly fair with me.
All right, then I expect you to be fair with me.
What about her father and mother?
You tried them?
Well, I don't think they got much.
Whatever they've got, they'll give to save their baby, won't they?
- Well, I don't know.
- You don't know?
Why, Hart, that's the most cold-blooded thing I've ever heard a man say.
To even question the willingness of a father and mother to come to the aid of their child...
- flesh of their flesh, bone of their bone.
- I didn't mean...
Where are they?
Get them on the phone right now.
- They live down in the country.
- Call them.
- It's long distance.
- We'll put it on the bill! Call them!
Will you get me
Mr. Magnus J. Wadsworth in Zanesboro?
The best friend any of us can have in this world may turn against us and become our enemy.
Our son, our daughter that we reared with loving care may prove ungrateful.
Those we trusted with our happiness and good name... may prove traitorous to that faith.
But when all others have fled, when riches have taken wing... and reputation fallen to pieces... there still remains one absolutely unselfish friend in this selfish world... one who will never desert us... one who will never prove ungrateful nor treacherous.
That's a man's dog, ain't it?
That's right, it is.
I was thinking it was...
Mr. Wadsworth, this is Amos.
Roxie's in some terrible trouble.
What? Yes.
Yes. No.
- And if we don't do something pretty quick...
- Do what?
I said, they're liable to... hang her.
Good!
They're gonna hang Roxie.
What did I tell you?
Let's get this straight, tootsie. I haven't committed myself on this proposition yet.
Maybe I'll be able to handle it and maybe not.
It all depends on developments.
But I'm going to give you a few tips just in case.
Well,
Maybe I shouldn't say this, but... I didn't do it.
You didn't do it?
Well, then I'm not sure I'm the man for the job. Now, if you're guilty...
- Please. I'm sorry I mentioned it.
- That's all right.
I'll keep it in mind in case of emergency... but for the present, we'll proceed along the customary lines.
Now, what we gotta do first is to go after sympathy through the newspapers.
The story of your life starts tomorrow in the Herald.
- From kindergarten tojail.
- What?
My secretary is writing it this afternoon, signed with your name.
An authoress!
Beautiful southern home, every luxury and refinement... magnolias, colored mammy... the full treatment.
Educated in private schools, sheltered like a little flower, and then ruined.
Parents dead, fortune swept away... a runaway marriage, and heartbreak.
You were a lovely, innocent child, bewildered by what has happened.
Young, full oflife and lonely... caught in a mad whirl of a great city!
- Music, lights, wine.
- The black bottom!
Like a moth to the flame.
And now the cold, gray dawn... mad world ceased...
a butterfly crushed on the wheel.
And what's lefy?
Regret.
That's the important thing... regret!
You'd give your life this very minute to bring him back.
Why did I do it?
Was I drunk or crazy?
All you can remember is a fearful quarrel, and then he threatened you.
- My honor?
- No, no.
We don't fall back on that unless we have to. He threatened to kill you.
Later, we'll work out why.
You can see him coming toward you now... with that awful look in his eyes, a wild look!
And get this... you both grab for the gun, see? Self-defense.
Whatever we work in later, that's there from the start.
And everything went purple.
Purple?
Black? White? Red?
Purple's good. It's new.
"As you both grabbed for the gun, everything went purple. "
- I like that.
- The reporters are downstairs, dear.
- Okay.
- Holy Moses. Haven't you got something else you could wear?
- What's wrong with this?
- For a clip joint, it's great.
But you gotta remember what I said, you dope... regret, remorse, unhappiness.
No matter what happens, there can never be any more gaiety or happiness for you.
- You'll never smile again, you understand?
- I got it.
Well, don't forget it.
Birdbrain.
Mrs. Morton, get me that black dress... the one with the sunflower on the stomach.
How is she today?
Poor child!
She's holding up magnificently, poor bewildered kid.
Right now, she can hardly realize what's happened.
Mr. Callahan,
I've just seen Finnegan, the janitor.
- What janitor?
- At the apartment house.
- And from what he says, she didn't do it.
- Shh!
Are you cr...
Are you nuts?
What are you trying to do, kill this story?
Listen, you are supposed to be a newspaperman... not a detective, you understand?
You are supposed to build up a story, not tear it down.
Gimme that.
Never scare me like that again.
Gentlemen, Mrs. Hart.
Roxie, dear, this is Mary Sunshine, the famous feature writer.
And these are some gentlemen of the press.
- How are you, Mrs. Hart?
- So glad to meet you.
- Boy!
- Oh, you poor child!
Come, sit over here.
We all understand.
I'm going to leave now, Roxie, so Miss Sunshine and the boys... can interview you without being disturbed.
Just answer their questions frankly.
Don't forget what I told you.
Yes, Daddy.
Just a frightened kid, that's all.
Good-bye, Mary.
- Good-bye, boys.
- Bye.
- Good-bye, Jake.
- Good-bye, Willy.
- Excuse me.
- Yes, of course.
- What's that?
- Dinner from the Ritz, madam.
There's two more outside, butjust from restaurants, no other hotels.
Listen to this...
"My heart and hand are at your feet.
"With you, my life would be complete.
Yours with pleasure, an unknown admirer. "
Isn't that lovely?
Probably from Lord Byron.
Then why doesn't he sign it?
- But, Mr. Flynn...
- Now wait a minute.
You get the dough,
I'll get you a pass, and not before!
But what kind of a jail is it... that everybody in the world can get in to the wife but the husband?
Everybody's been so lovely. I haven't had to eat this jail slop once.
Just what did happen, Mrs. Hart?
- How's that?
- Tell us in your own words, why?
Well, all I can remember is a dreadful quarrel, and then a threat.
I can see him coming toward me now with that awful look in his eye.
A wild look.
Oh, look, alligator pears! Gee, that fella certainly does give out, does he?
He was bearing down on you with that wild look...
and then what?
And then we both grabbed for the gun.
And get that straight... we both grabbed for it.
- And then?
- And then...
- everything went purple.
- Purple?
A purple... flash.
Light or dark?
Pardon?
I say, light purple like lavender... or dark purple like violet?
Violet.
In other words, self-defense.
You can bet your sweet life it was.
They'll be so glad to know you can eat.
It's choking me, every mouthful, but I feel it's my duty.
Oh, it is. It is.
You've got to keep up your strength.
I can't sleep at night either.
All night long, I just walk up and down, tossin' the floor.
You recall nothing specific during this, uh, purple patch?
- How could I? Must have been mad, insane.
- Oh, dear.
Oh, not for the asylum, understand?
Over with right away.
Sane before and sane after... with a little teensy-weensy spot of insanity right in the middle.
- Is that it?
- That's it. Shoot me the jam, Sam.
Is it true, Mrs. Hart, you were swept off your feet by jazz?
Yeah, what about that black bottom?
- Well...
- You're good at it, ain't ya?
- I ain't had no complaints yet.
- How about a little sample?
- Now?
- Sure. Why not?
- Sure, Roxie. Give, Roxie.
- Be a sport.
Boy!
Aw, you're really the nuttiest guy
I ever saw.
Why don't you, Mrs. Hart.
It might take your thoughts off your tragedy. Do a few steps for us.
You don't think it might be what you call out of place?
Certainly not.
You think we'd ask you if it would be?
Well.
I don't know if I ought.
Get away! Get away!
Go on, scat!
Who wants to see pictures of you, anyway?
- I'm the husband, ain't I?
- I don't believe it.
Well, hush my big black mouth!
Mrs. Hart,
I think you're just wonderful.
- What?
- I know you didn't do it. I just know it.
You're a sweetie pie to say that... but if you print it,
I'll wrap a chair around your neck.
Kind of liked her, huh?
"Kind of liked her"?
That's putting it feebly.
I couldn't sleep for thinking about her.
Go on.
I wanna hear some more.
Oil for the lamps of China, gentlemen.
A month later.
Chicago, Chicago
That toddlin'town
- Are you going to behave?
- Let go, you!
- Are you?
- Let go, I tell you!
- Are you?
- Yeah! Let go of my hair.
If I find you biting anyone else around here...
I'll have the dentist pull every tooth in your head!
Got a butt, buddy?
Won't you tell us just how you happened to take up banditry, Miss Baxter?
Did you suffer an inferiority complex?
Hello, Miss Sunshine.
Later, Mrs. Hart.
Or would you describe yourself... as a thrill slayer?
Mr. Callahan.
I got a scoop for you.
I'm thinking of going on a hunger strike.
Okay, kid. Happy hiccups.
What about the guy who was with you?
They got him outside.
Maybe you'd like to take a peek at him.
Do you want to come?
Roxie.
I'm awfully worried, Roxie.
You're worried?
Listen.
My lawyer goes out of town on a vacation.
My agent, whenever you want him, you can't find him.
In 10 days, only one little scoop of a story and no pictures.
And now this.
You can figure for yourself how I feel.
It's not that. Did you see that editorial in theLedgerthis morning?
It's not that. Did you see that editorial in theLedgerthis morning?
About me?
It said, "Why is it that men could be hanged in this county but not women?"
It was called:
"We demand equal rights for women. "
- Say! That's swell.
- Roxie, please, this is serious.
This case isn't going to be like the others. Everybody's getting sore... the mayor, the newspapers, the preachers, women's clubs, everybody.
- It never was like that before.
- You're sweet.
Don't you understand? They're gonna try to make you pay the penalty.
I never thought of anybody really worrying about me before.
If anything happened to you, Roxie,
I don't know what I'd do.
How old are you?
- Twenty-five.
- Well.
Listen, sweetie pie,
I'll tell you a secret.
Any old time the going gets too tough, all
I have to do is say one word and I'm out.
Just one word. That's all.
So you needn't worry.
I'm so happy.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Yeah, go find that Benham, that agent guy, and tell him I want some action.
- Right away.
- A proposition like this, you gotta keep it boiling.
Something new all the time. When you got your whole future tied up in it... you gotta grab it by the horn and hit it while it's hot.
Hit it while it's hot, grab it by the horn.
# Hit it while it's hot
Grab it by the horn #
# Hit it while it's hot #
Well, sir, if you thought
Roxie got a build-up... you should have seen Two-gun Gertie's.
Things moved fast in those days.
Almost before you knew it...
J. Edgar Hoover couldn't have found Roxie's name in the papers.
Two-gun Gertie, Two-gun Gertie... that's all the papers could think about.
But, gentlemen, class will always tell.
Roxie, crushed to earth, will always rise again.
Just when the hour was darkest, when obscurity seemed to have settled down permanently... over that brave little jailbird, up she zoomed again like a rocket.
Like a rocket.
Back to page one in every sheet in town.
With one little twist of the wrist, one simple girlish idea... the queen of them all once more resumed her throne.
Rock-a-bye, baby on the treetop
Chicago, Chicago
That toddlin'town, toddlin'town
When the wind blows the cradle will rock
Chicago, Chicago
When the bough breaks the cradle will fall
Chicago, that toddlin'town
And down will come baby cradle and all
Chicago
Slowly, my dear.
Slowly.
Yes, Daddy.
- Perhaps you better call me something else.
- Yes, Daddy.
Boy!
Oh, you poor dear child.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
I'm such a bother these days.
- Comfortable, my dear?
- Yes, Dad... dear Mr. Flynn.
Game little woman.
I've never seen anything like it.
Isn't it gorgeous?
Aren't you glad?
Glad? Glad?
To have your child born here?
Now, now, dear, you promised me not to get upset again.
Oh, what a story!
What a tragedy!
When is it to be, dear?
Oh.
Not till summer. June.
Harrison's trying to postpone the trial, you know, till after election.
For myself, it don't matter, but for the little one...
Fat lot Harrison cares about that.
Hello, Mr. Callahan.
We'll make him care.
I'll see to that.
I'll call every woman's club in the city, every mothers' and teachers' association.
- Oh, Mr. Callahan,
- Hmm?
I think Miss Baxter's trying to attract your attention.
We'll start a petition, get thousands and thousands and thousands of names.
- Swell! Great idea!
- Boy!
Demanding that bail be granted so an innocent babe can be born in God's great outdoors.
You mean in the woods?
- No, not bail, for immediate trial.
- Oh, swell, Mary.
- Jake, I think Miss Baxter wishes to speak with you.
- Yeah.
- She probably has a scoop for you.
- Hiya, Gertie.
- Just a minute.
Who's that dame! Scram, sister!
Upstairs, Gertie.
This is private.
Scat!
Ahh, poor Miss Baxter.
She seems to live such a lonely life.
I've got it!
Oh, I've got it!
- Yeah?
- We'll demand that the trial start on Mother's Day.
- Wonderful, Mary!
- Swell idea.
But I'm the father.
Don't you understand? I'm the father!
Ain't there any room at all for the father?
How many people did the state charge with the shooting of Casely? One.
How many did the grand jury indict?
One.
How many are named in the charge?
One.
Then how can the state try two?
That's a mighty pretty question,
Counselor.
Yeah.
Don't you worry, my dear.
The American public will fight to the death for you and your wee one.
But will we beat the rap?
That's the rancid test.
Every true woman in the country will be with you spiritually, Mrs. Hart.
Motherhood itself will be at stake.
You've been so kind, Miss Sunshine.
If it's a girl,
I'd like to name it after you.
Oh, you darling!
Oh, that is just too sweet.
And if it's a boy, after you, Jake.
No, not me, honey.
Thanks just the same.
You slip it to Billy here.
Well, I appreciate the honor, naturally... but I happen to be married, and happily, and would like to remain so.
Mr. Flynn,
Mr. Hart's outside making quite a fuss.
- He's got a crust.
- He wants to make it up with her.
Over my dead body! He turned on her, and he's gotta stay turned on her.
He can't switch back and forth like that. I'll never get a defense set.
- Shall I tell them to throw him out?
- No, I'll see him.
We can't allow him to have any sympathy at all.
He's got to be the heavy throughout.
I'll have to get him to divorce you.
If you don't lay off me, so help me...
I just want to give you a cigar, that's all.
- From you, I wouldn't take Clara Bow.
- Be with you in a minute.
- Take your time.
- Mr. Flynn, the cigars are on me this time.
Well, Hart, I congratulate you.
- Thanks, old man.
- That's the way to take it. Be a good sport about it.
- Came as quite a surprise too, you know.
- What does that matter?
The whole affair was obviously somewhat awkward. You're a man of the word, aren't you?
Yes, but what do you mean,
"Be a good sport"?
Exactly.
Now, I'm a bit older than you are, Hart.
Sit down.
I've seen such situations arise before... and the only way to take them is philosophically.
- Just laugh it off, that's all.
- Laugh?
Yes. No matter what they say to you, just laugh at them.
Laugh, and the world laughs with you.
Weep, and you look like a chump.
Maybe I better hold on to this for a little while yet.
- What's the matter?
- Maybe I ain't as big a chump as I look.
- Hart, you're not going to be a cad.
- Who says I ain't?
- Nobody can't make a fool out of me, you know.
- You amaze me.
You talk as if you were going to divorce her.
- And maybe that ain't all.
- What do you mean?
You think you're so smart, the both of you.
I know what you're figuring! You're figuring if the going gets too tough... you're gonna call in Finnegan, and he'll clear her and hang it on me.
Well, you ain't.
And you know why you ain't?
Because Finnegan is dead. Yeah!
Last week.
He had another stroke, and he's dead!
- Finnegan? Who is Finnegan?
- Not is, was.
Who was Finnegan?
Just tell her that, Mr. Wise Guy... and see what she says.
He's dead. Finnegan is dead!
Is that the way them big-shot lawyers go at a case?
That's the way
Mr. Billy Flynn went at one.
You'd think they'd throw him out of the courts.
They did.
Skullduggery in the first degree.
All right, go on, Homer.
I wanna hear what you've got to say about the trial.
The day of the big game dawned crisp and clear.
This account of the Roxie Hart trial, ladies and gentlemen... comes to you through the courtesy of Dr. Habakuk Twist... president and founder of the Twist Health Institute... who guarantees to cure you of cancer, dropsy, gout...
Bright's disease, lumbago, rheumatism, or sleeping sickness... or any combination of such diseases in five days by mail.
Your play-by-play announcer for the trial...
will be that veteran crime expert of the Daily Gazette, Mr. Jake Callahan.
Take it away, Jake Callahan.
Now, uh, at that point, you weep.
- I just wept.
- Well, then weep again... and every other time I say so!
I may not know much law, but I do know juries, and that's all we need.
Where was I?
Mmm.
My innocent unborn babe.
Yeah. On that, you throw your head back... nobly.
Good. But don't look at the jury on that. Just forget 'em.
Seek the eyes of your husband.
He has divorced me and cast me aside... but he is still the father of my child.
- "And the man I really love. "
- And the man I really love.
- You don't have to go down to the floor!
- You said slump, didn't you?
But gently, delicately, like a lady.
You were going on like a sea lion.
- Now, the cross-examination. - He better watch his step, that Harrison.
- If he starts calling me names, I'll crown him.
- Just cry!
Now listen. No matter what he says or how mad he gets, you shrink.
Shrink!
And cower.
And cry... with a little flutter.
Until the jury wants to rise up and tear him limb from limb!
And never forget... always you're frightened and helpless and demure.
Demure, I said.
Don't you know what demure means?
- Certainly.
- What?
- What?
- Demure means shy... timid, modest.
Oh.
His Honor's here, Counselor.
- Now, don't get excited.
- I'm not excited.
Let me look at you.
Turn around.
Here are your flowers.
Now take it easy.
And now, folks, it looks like...
Yes, it is, here she comes now...
Roxie Hart, that game little sharpshooter.
- Boy!
- Roxie, let's see your kisser.
Hey, Bill, what's with the geraniums?
Okay, here we go.
Open... flash!
That done it.
Darling, we're all for you.
You've got to come through.
Listen. This dame is alone, deserted, forsaken and forlorn.
Cut out this foolishness till she's free.
All right, Bill.
Hold it. Open. Flash!
Roxie, will you say a word or two to America?
Hello, America.
Hello, Ma.
Mrs. Hart and I have nothing to say except that win or lose... we expect to play the game fair and square... and let the court decide on the plain, unvarnished facts.
- That's fine.
- That, ladies and gentlemen... was Roxie Hart and Billy Flynn, her simple, barefoot mouthpiece.
And now here comes Judge Canton.
Look here. Hold it. Open. Flash!
The honorable court is in session.
Now, folks, the preliminaries are over, and we have a jury... a blue-ribbon jury, men of property, brokers or better... and they haven't had their eyes off Roxie since they sat down.
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
No, sir, I didn't do it.
Amos Hart, take the stand.
Let's take a shot of this.
Hold it still a minute. Hold it.
Okay. Hold it.
Open. Flash.
That did it.
All right, fellas. Break it up.
Do you swear the testimony you're about to give is the truth and nothing but the truth?
I do.
Will Your Honor kindly request the jury to give some small attention...
to the witness during this testimony?
I, uh... Certainly, certainly.
Pay attention to the witness, gentlemen.
- What's your name?
- Amos Hart.
What is your relationship to the defendant, Roxie Hart?
She used to be my wife.
Mr. Hart, will you tell the court, in your own words... what, if anything, happened in the apartment occupied by you and your ex-wife...
- on the evening of September 5?
- Well, sir... on the evening of September 5,
I arrived at my home...
1442 South Melrose, apartment six, from the poolroom where I hang out... at 1726 South Hoffman Boulevard at 7:17 p. m.
And what did you find, Mr. Hart?
I found Mrs. Hart shooting a man.
Hold it! Hold it! Nice, big smile.
All right. That's good.
Everybody, all right, hold it.
Open. Flash! That did it!
All right. Break it up, fellas.
Why don't you sit down right now... and write a nice, long letter to Dr. Habakuk Twist... and tell him about your gallstones.
Tell us the details, Mr. Hart.
Well, sir, I come up the stairs, and blam!
I heard this pistol shot in my apartment.
So, I bust in and there she was, banging away at this Casely fella.
Bang, bang, bang, bang!
- Bang?
- No, sir.
Just four bangs and the one I heard on the stairs. Five bangs altogether.
Well, how do you like that?
Did she speak?
Was she saying anything?
Yes, sir. She kept saying,
"Take that, you cur, and that and that!"
Can you beat it?
I never said "cur" in my life.
Your Honor,
I protest against these interruptions.
The defendant will keep quiet, please.
- Did you say anything?
- Yes, sir.
I said, "Roxie, you ought not to be shooting that man like that. "
- In other words, you protested.
- Yes, sir.
- And that was about what time?
7:20, wasn't it?
He said 7:19.
I must insist, Your Honor, that counsel for the defense...
I am as insistent, Your Honor, that this witness give a good performance.
- Gentlemen! Gentlemen!
- I resent that implication.
- If the witness needs more rehearsal...
- Take that back!
Gentlemen, gentlemen!
Your witness.
- When did you file suit for divorce, Mr. Hart?
- October the 15th.
Was there any particular reason for your filing suit on this exact date?
Well, sir, the papers came out with a story that... well, a statement that... well, there was going to be a little stranger.
Mr. Hart, is this grounds for divorce?
A little too much of a stranger.
- But they couldn't put anything over on you.
- I'll say they couldn't.
Had your wife apprised you ofher condition prior to said statement?
- How's that?
- Had your wife told you of this...
- this stranger?
- No, sir. Neither one of them.
Now tell us, Mr. Hart, do you expect this jury to believe that... with all due respect to the press... that our courts would grant you a divorce merely on a newspaper story?
No, sir. I had a statement that she'd made and signed herself.
- All about her and this...
- Where did you get the statement?
- From him.
- I protest, Your Honor!
So, the state prosecutor... gave you a statement that enabled you to cast aside... the woman that you had sworn to love and cherish for better or worse.
And what, Mr. Hart, did you give the state prosecutor in return?
This is too much!
I resent these infamous allegations!
- A deal was made!
- Take that back!
I repeat, a thieves' bargain was made.
A forged statement!
In exchange for this man's lying testimony!
Why, you cheap double-crossing shyster!
No man can call me that and live!
Come on, Mike.
Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it! Open. Flash!
That did it. Break it up, fellas.
Listen, Mr. Flynn. A photo finish may be good enough for you... but for me, anything less than eight lengths is too close!
That's a hanging district attorney out there.
I tell you, there is no occasion whatever for alarm.
All we need is one juror, and already
I've got that number-one guy... that big Irish foreman, right there.
The worst we can get is a hung jury.
Or a hung Roxie.
That's not good enough.
I've been doing exactly... whatJake and that agent said... let you carry the ball.
But I don't like that D.A.
I'm scared of him.
Oh, listen, listen.
Give me time, will you?
Listen, Mr. Flynn. The way I'm beginning to feel about my neck...
I want you to get a fella in here by the name of Finnegan... Michael Finnegan.
Get him fast,
'cause we need him and I ain't kiddin'!
- Finnegan? Finnegan?
- Finnegan thejanitor.
Put him on the stand and ask him who he sold his gun to.
Ask him what Amos said on that very morning.
- Mr. Flynn!
- Not a chance, buddy!
But it's important, I tell you!
- You can't see anybody now.
- Roxie!
Are you her lover or a newspaperman?
We got the biggest story of the century in our mitts.
If this dame swings, it'll be a story you could tell your grandchildren about.
- Why, you ghoul!
- Finnegan could tell him that that very morning...
Roxie, we can't get Finnegan.
Of course you can.
- What do you mean?
- He's dead.
Dead?
Uh-uh, nah, he can't be.
He's dead. He's been dead for two weeks.
We gotta do it my way.
He can't be! He can't do that to me!
I've been depending on him.
He heard him say it. He sold him the gun. He's the only one who...
I didn't do it.
I never had anything to do with him!
He was drunk.
I could have handled him.
He didn't have to shoot him!
Finnegan can tell him.
- Don't you understand?
- Roxie! Roxie!
It's important, Roxie!
I talked to that janitor.
- I interviewed him.
- Finnegan? You did? Let him in, Mike.
Mr. Howard, on the day after the killing of Fred Casely... did you have a conversation with one Michael Finnegan...
janitor of the apartment house in which the Harts lived?
- Yes, sir.
- Tell us what was said.
- When I talked to him...
- Your Honor, I object... to the witness answering on the grounds it would be hearsay.
Why wasn't this man Finnegan brought here himself to tell what he knows?
Well, he's dead, Your Honor.
He died two weeks ago.
Was there any other witness to the conversation?
- No, sir.
- Objection sustained.
- You mean I can't...
- I object to any further remarks.
- The witness will leave the stand.
- But this is important!
- It has an important bearing on...
- Such testimony is inadmissible.
Leave the stand at once, sir.
Step down, Mr. Howard.
The jury will disregard everything that was said by the witness.
You see, in New York or Los Angeles or some other sissy town... that'd be the end of it.
Nothing but law. But in Chicago, the law doesn't count.
It's justice we're after.
What do you say, kid?
- I'm scared.
- You can do it, you know.
They're gonna hang me.
Roxie, you know who's sitting out front there?
I don't care. I'm scared.
- Ziegfeld.
- I don't ca...
- Who?
- Ziegfeld... the greatest musical producer in the world.
No kid.
Mrs. Hart, take the stand.
Hold it! All right!
Hold it! Hold it, Roxie.
Let's take a nice one now.
Big smile, honey. That's it. Open.
Flash! That did it.
All right, fellas, break it up.
Oh, I got a pip.
Do you swear the testimony you're about to give is the truth and nothing but the truth?
Yeah, I do.
No drugs, no surgery, no down payment.
- Were do you live, Mrs. Hart?
- County jail.
When did you first meet Fred Casely?
Ten minutes past 5:00,January 8.
- Where?
- At a bus stop.
Tell the jury the circumstances.
Well, it was rainin', and I was standin' there with my girlfriend.
Mr. Casely drove up in his coupe and says, "It's a nice day for ducks. "
- And we said, "Yes. "
- Both of you?
She said it first, and then I said it.
And then he said could he drive us somewhere and... well, you know how crowded the buses are.
So, you said yes.
Well, she said it first, and then I said it.
- And so he drove you home.
- Yes, sir.
How did Mr. Casely conduct himself during this drive... unusually friendly in any way?
Oh, no, sir. He was a perfect gent in every sense of the word.
All he said was, wouldn't I like to have a screen test.
When was the next time you saw him?
The next day.
It rained again.
Would you say, then, that, uh,
Casely was now pursuing you?
- I'll say!
- Other than these innocent rides home in the rain... did you ever have any social engagements with this man Casely?
- Yes, sir. Once.
- And that was?
The Policeman's Benefit Ball.
He asked you to go to this ball and you consented...
- although you were married, Roxie?
- Yes, sir.
You believe in the sacredness of the marriage tie, don't you?
I object, Your Honor!
What the witness believes is immaterial.
You know that the marriage tie is sacred, don't you?
Oh, yes, sir. That's what I kept tellin' him all along.
Tell us, then, why you went to the policeman's ball that night with this man Casely.
Oh, I don't know.
So many things happen, you don't know why.
I wouldn't have if my...
Mr. Hart and me hadn't quarreled that morning.
Oh, Roxie!
And who was to blame?
Me, I guess.
It seemed like
I couldn't stop pesterin' him.
Pestering him?
What about?
Because I wanted a home, a real home with little kiddies.
- That's why!
- Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it, Roxie. That's it.
Get in a little closer.
That's it, talkin' to the kiddies.
I said hold it.
Open. Flash!
That did it.
All right. Break it up, fellas.
Now, uh, what happened at the policeman's ball?
He gave me a drink.
Really?
What kind of a drink?
Oh. I don't know.
It just tasted bad... nasty... kaaa!
If that's what whiskey is... ugh!
That is just the kind of loose talk that is giving whiskey a bad name.
Did Casely misunderstand your, uh, ambition to put your talents on the stage?
Oh, yes, indeed, sir.
Roxie Hart! The state charges you with the murder of Fred Casely.
- Guilty or not guilty?
- Not guilty!
Oh, not guilty!
Not guilty. I may have killed him, yes.
But not murder!
Oh, not that!
Do you remember
Friday, September 5?
Yes, sir.
Tell the jury now in your own way... the happenings of that day in the late afternoon.
Now, take your time and speak clearly.
Well, that afternoon at Mr. Casely's request...
I went to his office and gave an audition for a Mr. Marcus.
- What kind of an audition, my dear?
- I did the black hula.
- The black hula?
- It's a mixture of the hula hula and the Black Bottom.
- I invented it myself.
- That's enough.
Continue.
So when I finished, Mr. Marcus turned to Mr. Casely and said...
- "Are you kidding?" and walked out.
- Go on.
So I took the Cottage Grove car to South Melrose... and stopped at a grocer's to buy some baking powder for some biscuits for breakfast.
He loved my biscuits.
- And this was about what time?
- 6:11 p. m.
So I was singing about my housework when the doorbell rang...
- and thinking it was my girlfriend, Irma...
- Never mind what you thought.
I went to the door, and who do you think it was?
- Casely?
- It wasn't his uncle.
And, oh, was he intoxicated.
So I said, "Go away, Mr. Casely.
You are intoxicated. "
- But do you think he paid any attention to that?
- He entered?
He forced his way into my presence.
Now, now, now, now, be strong, my dear.
Bear up.
So I said, "You certainly got a crust,
Mr. Casely. And please beat it.
"'Cause how do you think this is going to look to my... to my husband. "
- And he still wouldn't go?
- Well, he was really crocked.
- I mean, intoxicated.
- Well, why didn't you scream?
Oh, I was ashamed for the neighbors to know.
Well, you know how you'd feel.
But I kept sayin' to him we could easy get into a jam here.
So, finally, he said if I'd just take one drink with him, he'd beat it.
- So I did.
- And then?
Oh, he was really simply insane about me, you know.
- But you...
- Oh, I loved my husband.
I really did.
And when you told him that, what did he say?
Nothing.
He just grabbed me.
And where were you at this time?
Uh, standing by the pianola.
Show the jury.
- Take it easy.
- Here.
- And Casely?
- On the floor... Uh, by the door.
Roxie, tell the jury... what happened next.
Well, it just happened that Mr. Hart's revolver was laying on the telephone table.
And Mr. Casely made a grab for it, and I said, "Cut that out, Mr. Casely!"
I knocked it out of his hand. It fell on the floor and we both grabbed for it.
- We both grabbed for it.
- Yes?
I got it, and then he started for me.
I can see him now with that awful look in his eye. A wild look.
What kind of a look? Describe it to the audience, uh, to the jury.
Oh, it was terrible... angry, like a crazy man.
- Did you think he might kill you?
- Oh, yes, sir.
- I know if once he got that gun...
- It was his life or yours.
Oh, yes, sir.
But he still kept comin' toward me.
On and on with that awful look, that wild look.
- And then I shut my eyes.
- Go on, Roxie.
- And then I fired.
- In defense of your life!
My life, yes.
But not just mine.
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!
All right. Get in a little closer.
All right, everybody. Hold it! Open!
Flash! That did it. Break it up, fellas.
Do you suffer from spots before the eyes?
Now, here's where you weep.
You may take her life, gentlemen, as the state asks.
But that won't bring Casely back.
Hmm.
That's always news to a jury.
- And for what purpose, to protect society?
Well, weep you fool!
Open your mouth.
Give me that gum.
Give me that gum!
- You may take her life, gentlemen, as the state asks,
But that won't bring Casely back.
- And for what purpose, to protect society?
Do you fear that weeping girl?
- Do you?
- No.
- Do you?
- No.
For her reformation?
She learned her lesson, gentlemen...
in those dark hours, alone in her cell.
For punishment?
Great heavens, gentlemen.
Hasn't she been punished enough? No.
None of these. But to satisfy the greedy ambition of the prosecution.
Prosecution? No.
Persecution!
You are asked for a life, gentlemen... by one who would climb to fame on dead bodies.
We cannot give her happiness now.
It is too late for that.
Betrayed, crushed... we can only let her pick up the broken fragments of her life... the tangled threads.
We can give her another chance.
Quiet.
Gentlemen, if you convict this delicate child... it would be like taking these fragile flowers... and crushing them into dead and broken blossoms.
No! No! Oh, no!
Oh, no...
Stand back, gentlemen!
- The defense rests, Your Honor.
- Hold it!
Hold it, Bill!
That's fine! A little this way!
That's right, Bill!
All right now. Everybody, hold it!
Open! Flash! That did it!
They're ready, boys.
They're ready, boys.
Boy!
The defendant please rise.
"We, thejury, find the defendant... "
Heya, Roxie Hart...
Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you... all of my dear, dear friends.
If a man jumps into your home, you got a right to protect your home, haven't ya?
- Sure! Sure!
- All I know is, the judge said bring you in.
- You tell him all about it.
- But if you find a man in your home... you got a right to do something about it!
Jake! Jake! Hey, wait a minute, Jake!
I'm sorry, kid.
It's all over!
You're yesterday's news!
- Did you shoot Casely?
- Yes, but I couldn't...
Then have no fear. Justice will prevail if we have to take your case... to the Supreme Court.
Of the United States.
The whole thing is persecution.
A deal was made!
Open! Flash! That did it!
Well, for cryin' out loud.
Oh, Roxie,
I can't tell you how happy I am.
They never even let me thank 'em.
When they didn't come in for so long...
Oh, darling...
You're free now, you know.
We can go out, have dinner together... see a show, be together, dance together...
Mrs. Hart,
I just want to congratulate you.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.
- I don't want too be too forward... but could I give you a lift somewhere in my Packard?
- Packard?
- Roxie.
What a dame.
What a dame!
So that was Roxie, gents, and the bad old days.
Drink her down.
The bad old days.
What a dame.
- Hey, Homer.
- Okay.
Good night, gentlemen.
- Thanks a lot.
- Roxie Hart.
- And thank you too.
- What a dame.
- Good night to you, Mr. O'Malley.
- Good night.
- You still got that Packard?
- No.
- Gone, huh?
- 1929, and everything with it.
Gee, that's too bad.
Awful.
A nice big car like that.
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
Much obliged.
- The wife sore?
- Well, you said you'd pick her up two hours ago, you know.
Did I?
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
Good evening, Mrs. Howard.
Hand Ritchie right over here.
Here.
- Darling.
- Yes, dear.
I got some news for ya.
We're gonna have to have a bigger car next year.
# You'll find your life will begin
# The very moment you're in Argentina
# Where there are rumbas and tangos to tickle your spine
# Moonlight and music and orchids and wine
# You'll want to stay
# Down Argentina way
(# "South American Way")
(sings in Portuguese)
(song continues)
# In the grand and glorious, gay, notorious South American way
(man) A un lado. Pónganse a un lado.
Suban al muelle. Anden. Suban al muelle.
Bonito, vas a tener un viaje muy bueno, pero no te marees, ¿eh? No te marees.
Bonito.
Here are the prices
I wish you to get for the horses, my son.
Wishing is one thing, but what will you take?
- When you win an event, double the price.
- If I lose, should I cut it in half?
If you lose, muchacho, cut yourself in half.
Ricardo, have the same success you had at the London horse show and I'll be very happy.
Don Diego. Don Diego.
For you this was delivered at the estancia.
See this thing come for you.
You see, I did not open it.
(Diego) Esteban!
Esteban!
- ¿Me llamó usted, señor?
- Unload the horses.
Unload the horses?
Sí. Unload the horses.
Get every one of them off the ship.
Sí, señor.
Enseguida, que bajen los caballos pronto.
- Why do you change your plans, Papa?
- That cable.
The woman is interested in buying some horses. Why is that so terrible?
I would rather kill every one of my horses than have that woman get hold of them.
Why, is she as bad as that?
I do not know her, but her brother,
Willis Crawford, is a scoundrel.
We were at school together in Paris.
I trusted him and he cheated me.
Well, tell me what he did to you and then we can hate him together.
I do not consider this a matter for joking, Ricardo.
Papa, why do you change your plans because of somebody you have not seen for years?
If he or his sister attempts to buy any of the horses, I won't sell to them.
- Perhaps you are right.
- Why, certainly.
- And the passage is paid for?
- Why, yes.
Esteban.
- Esteban!
- Sí, señor.
Esteban, I have changed my mind.
Load the horses.
Lo-lo-load the horses?
Sí, load the horses.
Suban los caballos pronto.
Suban los caballos, aprisa.
Suban los caballos, pronto.
Pronto, suban los caballos.
(fanfare)
What are you doing here?
You have to get ready for your event.
I have plenty of time, Dad.
I had to see this event.
Carmelita, you show off for all the judges.
¡Vamos!
- Wonderful, isn't he?
- Do you mean the man or the beast?
- Beautiful.
- You're not thinking of buying that animal?
Of course not.
What would I do with him? I have 12.
That's what you said when you had 11.
Señor, that's the most beautiful jumping I've seen all year.
Muchas gracias, señorita.
Carmelita is a great horse.
- I don't suppose she's for sale?
- Oh, yes. That is exactly what she is.
Oh, she's really something.
I don't see how you can sell her.
That is the trouble with breeding - you keep getting more horses, and some you must sell.
What are you asking?
She was 10,000 before she won, but now she's 20.
I'll give you five.
It would give me great pleasure for you to have the horse, but that is impossible.
- Shall we say 15?
- Five.
Oh, señorita... I have it.
In as much as you were interested in her before her victory, you can have her for ten.
Five. This is your last chance.
Well, you... you drive a hard bargain, señorita, but if you will have dinner with me...
I have an engagement at the Westchester.
- A martini before dinner?
- Fine. Nine o'clock at the Westchester.
- All right. Good luck, señorita.
- Thank you.
Muy bien, Carmelita. Muy bien.
Te portaste como nunca.
Now, señor, you can sell her for a fortune.
I have already sold her, Esteban, for $5,000... and a martini.

Glenda said it would only take a minute.
What sort of a deal is this?
- It's a horse trade.
- Well, I don't like it.
Write to your Congressman.
It comes under international relations.
I've bought many horses, but it's never been done this way.
Once you have tried this, you will never go back to the old way.
No. I think we will be much more comfortable over there, huh?
- Will we?
- Yes.
I have very much to tell you.
My plane leaves for Buenos Aires in an hour.
I cannot miss it. Therefore I must talk fast.
- I'll try not to delay you.
- Señorita... if...
Aren't you getting into rather deep water?
Why should I deny it?
I'm in over my head already.
The first time I looked into your remarkable eyes,
I knew that I was lost.
I've flown over the high mountains,
I've gone down narrow rapids,
I've even loved other women, but never have I been so dizzy, so-so helpless as I am at this very moment.
It is like a sudden storm over the pampas.
You think you can run. Before you know it, it is upon you, sweeping you off your feet, and your heart, your heart is beating like the storm.
It may frighten you, but it is too wonderful to miss.
I'm not frightened. Not a bit.
Isn't that horse sold yet? Well, well. Just an old South American custom, I presume?
Hello, Binnie. This is...
Ricardo Quintana.
This is my aunt, Binnie Crawford.
Crawford? You are Binnie Crawford?
Yes. I cabled you about buying some horses.
I wanted to start a stable, but my riding teacher got married.
Besides, I got an archery set for my birthday. I was 32 last month.
She's your aunt on your mother's side, no?
No, on my father's side.
Oh, then you are also a Crawford?
Yes. Glenda Crawford.
Evidently you don't care for it.
Yes, I do. I like Glenda very much. For the last name I would have preferred something else.
- Have you ordered?
- I'll have a martini.
- A sirocco for me.
- What is that?
- Straight brandy with a cherry.
- I'll have that with no cherry.
I'll have the cherry. It doesn't matter, but Jimmy's about to blow a gasket.
I'll go in. If you have a bill of sale,
I'll give you a cheque.
Oh, yes, of course, the bill of sale.
I-I do not know quite how to say this, but it is something that must be said.
Perhaps after we have the drink.
Shall we sit down?
You're not backing out on our bargain?
I am desolate, señorita, but it is impossible for me to sell you Carmelita.
- I suppose someone offered more money?
- Oh, no. No, it is not that, I assure you.
I could not sell you the horse for any amount of money.
Just this evening I found out that my father had already made a previous commitment.
But I bought the horse.
We made a deal. We agreed on it.
I should have told you a long time ago,
I know, but I did not know how to say it.
So that's what you've been building up to.
Well, I won't let it ruin my life.
Oh, no, we must not let it ruin anything, señorita.
- We must have this last dance together, no?
- No, no. Jimmy's waiting for me.
He always keeps his engagements, señor.
- Have you ever tried a blackout?
- What is that?
Straight gin with a green olive.
I will get one right away.
Con su permiso.
I love cherries.
# Two dreams met
# They knew of two hearts that were lonely
# That could be so happy
# If only they found romance
# Two dreams met
# They said we must go out and find them
# And then as we tiptoe behind them
- I'd like to dance with you, señor.
- You are very kind, señorita.
I'm just mad about that horse of yours.
Thank you too much.
# "Turn around," my dream kept saying
# I did, and you were there, then
Next month we're going up Mount Rainier with nothing but mules.
I said next month we were going up to Mount Rainier on mules.
- Well, what do you think of that?
- Hm? Oh, not this week, Jimmy.
Señorita.
- It is time for me to leave, so I will say adiós.
- Goodbye.
I hope we'll be meeting again sometime soon.
Perdóneme, señorita.
Adiós. Adiós.
Congratulate me, my dear. I just bought
Carmelita the champion Argentine jumper.
You bought her?
Yes. Considering your interest in the owner, it's a wonder you didn't.
- How could I? You had a commitment.
- Commitment?
I didn't have any commitment.
I offered him 5,000 just now and he took it.
Well, that's what I offered him.
Why would he do that?
Perhaps it was my dancing, darling.
Shall we sit this one out?
"Your eyes. Your remarkable eyes."
If he ever looks into my eyes again, he'll really see a storm over the pampas.
- What bit her?
- I don't know. Something about the pampas.
Oh, well, cheer up, Jimmy.
The pampas is a long way away.
If I'm not mistaken, you were about to ask me to dance.
You were mistaken.
I was mistaken.
I was mistaken.
# For two lonely hearts were one
# Do-do-do, do-do-do-do
# When two dreams met
We'll sell this one. Sell Apprentice too.
We'll keep this mare. Tendon's a little sore.
Better put a blister on her.
- Yes. I'd like to turn her out till spring.
- Yes, do that.
I want to keep Vain Belle, and Lady Bosun.
- Morning, Aunt Binnie.
- Morning, Miss Crawford.
- Sell all the rest.
- Yes, ma'am.
Why are you unhorsing yourself? You'll have a lot of saddles and nothing to put them on.
- Oh, I'm fed up.
- Fed up?
You're fed up? Hm.
I'm gonna get rid of everything but the mares and bring in some new blood.
Maybe I'll go to Ireland and get some hunters for a change.
Or I...
I might get some racehorses.
I may even go to Kentucky or I may even go out to California.
Ireland, Kentucky, California?
Why don't you come out with it?
When do we leave for South America?
What's wrong with that? They have wonderful horses in South America.
Wonderful horses, and wonderful men.
I'd trust the men about as far as you could throw the horses.
- Are we going by boat?
- No. There's a plane leaving tonight.
I thought we might take that.
I bet we do, and with a good, strong tailwind,
I suppose you'll get there as soon as he does.
Get in, you beautiful brat.
South America, here we come.
- Señorita Crawford?
- Oui, oui. I mean, sí, sí.
I was Señor Montero. I have the honour to general manage for your brother his piston rings in South America.
I would wish you to want to know my sales manager, Señor Rufino.
I'm so very much delightful to meet you.
My assistant, Señor Valerga.
The pleasure, she's all mine.
How do you do.
My niece, Miss Glenda Crawford.
How do you do.
We wish you to welcome us in Buenos Aires, so that any little service we can be to you, all you have to do is lift your little finger.
- That's good of you.
- No, it is good of you.
- It's very good of you.
- No, it's good of you.
Oh, why don't you toss for it?
For your connivance while you are here, we have provide the automobile and the chauffeur, equipped, of course, with Crawford's piston rings.
And now, if we will come with you, you can escort me to the hotel.
- Us will be glad to.
- Thank you very much.
The inside is open.
Anastasio.
Anastasio!
Che, dormilón.
Al Hotel Rosedal.
Go! Go! Go!
Oh, this is completely incidental,
I can insure you.
Thank me very much.
Oh, I... I will never forgive yourself.
Miss Crawford, welcome to Buenos Aires.
I'm Dr Padilla, your father's friend from the embassy.
I wish to take you and your aunt to dinner and to a concert.
Oh, that's very nice of you.
Just a moment. I'll ask her.
It's Dad's ambassador friend.
He'd like to take us to dinner and a concert.
I wouldn't go if Beethoven was playing "The
Woodpecker Song". I'll sleep for two days.
Well, I'm not.
I didn't come 6,000 miles to go to bed.
Hello? My aunt won't be able to go.
She's rather infirm, you know? But I'd love to.
Oh, thank you, thank you.
You make me very happy. Yeah.
- Snice girl. Get two tickets for the concierto.
- (woman) For the contesto?
- No. Concert.
- Por la corrida?
- No. Please! Concert!
- Consommé?
- No. Not consommé. Concert!
- Corrida?
(sings opera)
# Two tickets for the concert
Well, how do I look?
- Like a hungry leopard.
- (doorbell)
Wait a minute. You're sure to need this.
Oh, Aunt Binnie.
- Señorita Crawford?
- Yes. Come in, Your Excellency.
Excellency? Thank you.
I'd like you to meet my aunt, Miss Crawford.
- Your aunt? But so young! So beautiful! No?
- No.
Yes. It is rather unusual, isn't it?
I was 31 my last birthday, Your Excellency.
Your Excellency... Please, that is too formal.
Now that we know each other so well, just call me Tito.
I must say, there isn't anything very formal about that, is there, Tito?
- Welcome to Buenos Aires.
- Oh!
Flowers. How thoughtful of you.
Oh, it is nothing at all. It establishes goodwill.
I find that I get much further that way.
- Are you sure you're going to a concert?
- If the señorita wishes.
If your heart isn't too set on it,
I'd prefer to see the nightlife.
Encantado. Absolutely.
I know every place in town.
Oh fine. Sorry to leave you, dear.
I shall regret your charming absence, but fortunately I'll have the scintillating presence of the señorita to soften the pain.
- She better keep her guard up.
- There is no cause for worry.
I never what you call... put on the pressure. No, no, no.
I shall go only as far as señorita wishes.
Well, the señorita went 6,000 miles last week.
Oh! Señorita.
Señorita.
(doorbell)
Señorita Crawford. Oh.
Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Dr Padilla.
I called earlier from the embassy.
What? Why, you can't be.
You just left here with my niece.
Oh, but you are mistaken.
I've never been in this house all evening.
- Then who was he?
- Señorita, we are talking in riddles.
Perhaps we should start over again.
I am your brother's friend. Arturo Padilla.
I, that's me, came here this evening to take your sniece to the concert.
I brought these flowers for her.
Orchids! Oh, you must be the ambassador.
The other one brought dahlias.
You mean there's an impostor?
What does he look like?
Oh, he's tall, dark and handsome, and he says the nicest things.
Oh, it's diabolical!
The man is a perfect double for me.
- Come, we must apprehend him.
- I'll get my wrap.

- Having a good time?
- Oh, wonderful.
- Would you like to see another spot?
- I'd love to.
Check, please.
I have been tipping 10º/% .
Is that satisfactory?
I wouldn't cut it too close.
The man undoubtedly has four children.
Five.
They always have five children.
65º/% .
Carry six, add 15.
- I see you're on a budget.
- Oh, I never trust my memory.
I always put everything down, then there is no argument later.
The total is getting rather high.
- I-I feel rather guilty.
- We can stop any time. Just say the word.
Oh, no. I'm having such a wonderful time.
Why don't I pay for a while?
But you are.
- I am?
- Certainly.
- You are the ambassador, aren't you?
- Ambassador?
Señorita, I've never even voted.
I'm Tito Acuña, the best guide in Buenos Aires.
Guide? Well, who guided you to me?
Anastasio. Your chauffeur.
He's my brother-in-law.
I pay him when he brings me a prospect.
It keeps my sister from taking in so much washing.
Tito, you've caused another international incident.
I cannot worry about that when the amount in my black book is already over 400 pesos.
This does not include the tip to the hat-check girl, which was my personal item.
Oh, well, you put that down.
I'll pay for everything.
¡Encantado! In that case, the next hat-check girl is on me.
Fine.

- Shall we finish it?
- Why not?
- We might as well get my money's worth.
- Oh!
(band plays conga)
They seem to like us very much, huh? We're good.
Have you looked around?
This is a real hot conga. You don't see anything like that in New York.
No. Oh, but they're wonderful.
Please tell them they're the best I've ever seen.
Of course, Señorita.
La señorita dice que ustedes son los mejores bailarines de conga que ha visto.
Sorry, but we don't understand Spanish.
- We're from Syracuse.
- Oh.
(band plays "Down Argentina Way")
(laughter)
Señorita, this spot is the ultimate.
Since Carmen Miranda came here, nobody can get in.
- You're sure you can get a table?
- Absolutely.
The head waiter is my ex-brother-in-law.
Since my sister left him, he has been so grateful that he will do anything for me.
Permiso. Permiso, señor.
I beg your pardon.
(# "Mamae Eu Quero")
(sings in Portuguese)
- ¿Qué tal, Sebastián?
- Shh. Carmen Miranda.
(# "Bambu Bambu")
(sings in Portuguese)
(applause)
Excuse me,
I've got to see a man about a horse.
Señorita Crawford. Why... I'm amazed.
I cannot believe my eyes.
I had no idea you planned to come to Buenos Aires.
- I didn't. I won a cruise at a bridge party.
- Oh, you are very lucky.
It really wasn't luck. I came here to look for horses. I wasn't doing so well in New York.
I'm... I'm very sorry, señorita, that you could not have had Carmelita.
Oh, please don't worry about it.
Helen was so thrilled.
It would have pleased me very much more if you could have had the horse.
You couldn't help it. Your father made a commitment. Besides, Helen's my friend.
You are very generous, señorita.
Many people would not be so understanding.
- Thank you.
- What shall I order for you?
Not a thing. I've had a little too much champagne already.
Oh, that's wonderful.
I have had too much brandy.
- Tell me, is your aunt with you?
- What did you say?
I was asking about your aunt.
Is she with you?
- Yes, but she's back at the hotel.
- Oh, good.
I mean, I hope she is getting a good rest.
If the orchestra is trying to make conversation difficult, they are successes.
- Don't they have verandas in Buenos Aires?
- No.
But they have balconies.
(orchestra plays "Mamae Eu Quero")
Sebastián, what are they up to?
With me it is not guesswork.
I know where the stairway leads.
(Glenda gasps)
This is lovely.
- Do you come here often?
- No. A friend of mine told me about this.
This is just like the Westchester, no?
- Except that Binnie won't interrupt us.
- And I do not have to catch a plane.
And there's no misunderstanding about a horse.
If I did not know that you had come down here to buy horses,
I would be hoping that you had come down here to see me.
Perhaps I did.
You said it was like a sudden storm, but it didn't really hit me until after you left.
You have thought of me, Ricardo?
Oh, sí, querida.
You have been with me in my mind every waking moment, and at night I have adored you in my dreams.
But if I hadn't come down here, we never would have seen each other again.
It had to happen.
If we'd not met like this,
I would have found you some way.
Nothing could have stopped us.
You said it was too wonderful to miss, didn't you, Ricardo?
Sí, mi vida, sí.
- Well, I didn't.
- Why did you do this to me?
- That's what I came down here to do.
- Wait! Explain yourself.
Shh. Carmen Miranda.
Your client has been away for a long time.
You don't think she has left?
I have absolutely not a worry.
Her credit is phenomenal.
Every time you see an automobile, it has a piston ring of her father's inside it.
- Tomad la adición.
- Oh.
- Anastasio.
- Anastasio.
Take me to the hotel.
There he is! Surround him.
Be careful. He may be armed.
- What have you done with my niece?
- How dare you, señor?
Do you not know it is a serious offence to impersonate an official?
I have impersonated nobody but myself. I'm
Tito Acuña, the best guide in Buenos Aires, and tonight was purely business, although I haven't been paid.
- Then where is Señorita Crawford?
- I lost her.
The young lady, I heard her tell the driver to go back to the hotel.
Just the same,
I do not believe this man's story.
I've taken thousands of women out and never have I had a single complaint.
Really?
Thank you very much.
You've been very kind, Your Excellency.
(whines)
Don Diego!
Don Diego!
Tourists outside want to buy horses.
¡María, mate para Casiano!
- What kind of tourists are they?
- Hm... the man... nothing.
But the señora, or maybe señorita, is Americana.
Ah, in that case, perhaps she can afford to buy.
They got girl with them.
She want to see baby horses in the paddock.
- I told her all right.
- A young girl?
Well, Ricardo, my eyes don't see so good like they did long time ago, but she is young, beautiful like a flower.
That much I see.
Excuse me, Papa.
- Sit down, Casiano.
- Gracias.
Him -just like his father, eh?
That old groucho said he was getting a Don Diego.
- Where do you suppose they keep him?
- Wherever it was...
Ah, he has been found already.
Panchito, where are you taking Furioso?
No place, señor. I take him back to the stable.
Wait a minute.
I asked you where you were taking the horse.
Uh...
What is the matter with you?
He got a memory to forget. I told him to take Furioso to the north pasture.
He no like no more the grass on the south pasture.
- What a magnificent horse.
- Gracias.
- Is he for sale?
- Oh, no, no, señora.
There is not enough money in all North America to buy him.
This is Furioso, the finestjumper in the Argentine.
For last three year - three - he win every blue ribbon at horse show in Buenos Aires.
- He'll win another one in two weeks.
- Go about your business, Panchito.
Go with him, otherwise the boy may forget and turn himself out to graze.
Vamos, muchacho.
Well, señora, what kind of horses did you wish to buy?
The four-legged kind.
My name is Binnie Crawford and...
- Crawford?
- That's right, Crawford.
You will please me very much, señora, if you leave my property at once.
I only asked to buy horses.
I sell no horses to Crawfords. Go, señora.
Tito, are you gonna let that goat talk to me this way?
Señor...
Señorita, I think it is too late.
He said it already.
You will go this instant, señora, or I will have you put out.
I'll go all right.
I wouldn't stay if you threw a barbecue in my honour.
(horn beeps)
(Binnie) Ye Gods! What next?
- What are you doing here?
- I live here.
Well, stay away from that house. There's a madman there. He just threw me off the place.
You refer to my father.
You must have told him your name.
Yes, I did. And I added a few under my breath.
Well, I apologise for him. About some subjects he's a little strong-headed, but he's very nice when you know him.
Until you get acquainted you'd do well to have a hatchet.
Get in, Glenda. I've had enough.
No. I have asked Señorita Glenda to ride back to the city with me.
All right. You can take chances with your life if you want to, but I'm much too young.
(horn beeps)
- Well, shall we go and get the car?
- What about your father?
Oh, I promise you, he will not attack without warning. We Quintanas are sportsmen.
What's over there?
Oh. Come. I'll show you.
All our favourite horses are buried here.
This big stone is on the grave of Tempestad.
He won the Palermo handicap three times.
All told, he won 48 races, until he died in 1925.
- He was the greatest horse my father had.
- I didn't realise you had racehorses.
Oh, yes. We did at one time.
But now we have not raced for 15 years.
Tempestad was cut down and killed on the track.
My father has refused to race since that day.
It isn't fair to condemn the whole sport because of one accident.
No.
Oh, here he comes now.
Ricardo.
What's the best footpath back to the city?
I have been looking for you, Ricardo.
I have had the most unfortunate experience.
What was that?
I have just had to put some people named Crawford off the place.
Oh, we saw a car drive away. That is too bad.
The young lady, Ricardo.
I do not believe we have met.
Tenéis razón, papá.
This is Señorita Cunningham.
We met in New York. Something happened to her car. I will drive her back to the city.
I am sorry, Señorita Cunningham, if I seemed abrupt, but I am somewhat upset.
- You will be in the Argentine for a little time?
- Well, my plans are a little indefinite.
Before you leave, you must pay us another visit.
Thank you very much. I'd love to.
Then I shall be expecting
Ricardo to bring you. Adiós.
- Well... He-he's nice.
- Then you will accept his invitation?
That was to a Miss Cunningham.
I doubt if he'd want Miss Crawford.
After he gets to like Miss Cunningham, then he will feel much more favourably disposed toward Miss Crawford.
Of that I am certain.
(band plays)
- What's going on?
- This is the annual village fiesta.
Once each year, the peons get together and drink and dance... and perhaps make love.
In this little village you will find the true Argentine.
- The true Argentine, huh?
- Ye...
- Sing, señorita.
- (all) Sing, señorita!
# Just sing to your señorita
# She'll be sweet to you, señor
# Every gaucho and caballero
# Should be a true troubadour
# Sing to your señorita
# And you never will go wrong
# She'll confess to the magic music
# And she'll say yes to a song
# Try a serenade to tell her of her charms
# And you'll find the words and music in your arms
# So sing to your señorita
# All your cares won't mean a thing
# She will gladly be your chiquita
# So sing to your señorita, sing
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
# Try a serenade to tell her of her charms
# And you'll find the words and music in your arms
# So sing to your señorita
# You'll be happy as can be
# If a song brings romance along
# Tell me why, oh, why won't someone sing to me?
# Sing, señorita, sing
- What is it? A fire?
- No, a horse race.
Whenever ten or more Argentinians get together there is always a horse race.
Furioso, I want to tell you something.
Remember, this race is only 300 metres, so you've got no time to stop and eat the grass.
Watch the man with the flag. When you see his fingers move, then you start.
Don't show off because you know you can beat these other horses.
Remember I love you.
And I got four to one.
(man) Me tiene loca.
Mire, mire las patas y tiene cara de ganar con estas patas.
¡Andan! ¡Andan!
- That horse! That is Furioso!
- He's wonderful!
He is our champion jumper.
How is he in this race?
I don't know how, but he's certainly in it.
- Casiano, te felicito. Casiano, te felicito.
- Sí, sí.
Sí, my horse, my horse.
Muy buen caballo. Vamos a tomar algo.
- Ysuerte.
- Gracias, señor. Gracias. Gracias.
Maybe some time you get a horse with four legs, then we have another race.
- No, you won't.
- Ricardo.
Please, for the love of soledad do not give me away.
- Casiano, you'd better start explaining.
- I mean to do no harm.
Furioso likes to run a little bit now and then, and I make a few pesos.
But the pesos, it's to send Panchito to school someday.
- You mean that this has happened before?
- Only a couple of times.
We win a good race at La Plata by ten lanes.
La Plata? You've had him on the racetracks?
It was just once. When Don Diego was in Rio,
I paint star on Furioso, call him American horse.
He paid 25 to one.
Casiano, when my father hears that you have been racing his bestjumper, he'll nail your ears to the stable door.
- That other horse wasn't even in it.
- Sí. He only touched the ground two times.
He ought to be racing on the flat.
'Course he should. He was born for it.
His grandfather was Tempestad.
But to Furioso
I guess that makes little difference.
He's happy. Three meals a day, other horses for company.
No, Ricardo. There you make big mistake.
Furioso want to be a racehorse.
I catch him worrying many times about this.
Your papa isn't the same since he stopped racetrack business.
What you say is true. But he would eat his heart out before he would admit it.
If you can't reason with him, show him.
Train the horse, put him in a race.
If he loves the track, he couldn't resist seeing his silks win.
He would skin us and put us in the trophy case.
I thought the Quintanas were sportsmen.
Señorita, there is only one possible answer to that.
Casiano, day after tomorrow we work the horse on the racetrack on the north pasture.
Ricardo!
No. Maybe it's no good. For me, Ricardo, it don't make much difference. I'm an old man.
But for you it's too soon to die so young by the hand of your father.
But then I guess we all die sometime.
¿No es cierto?
1:41. What kind of a breeze was that?
And the boyero, he was holding him all the time.
(Ricardo) 1:40 and two.
1:37 and one. (whistles)

Hey, Ricardo! Ricardo!
Furioso, he don't want his dinner.
- What is the matter with him?
- Maybe he's all mixed up.
He don't know if he is racing horse orjumping horse.
In the morning he jumps with your papa, in the afternoon he races for you.
This morning, he could notjump over the jumping beam.
- He ran all right this afternoon.
- That's it. He knows he should be racing.
But how long he'll know it...
That's no way to train a racing horse - jumping him, running him - mixing him all up.
Soon he'll have nervous breakdown, then we can do nothing with him.
- We should stop jumping him.
- Stop jumping him? But the show is Sunday.
- Señorita Cunningham.
- Papa.
Casiano said there is something wrong with Furioso.
He's notjumping and he would not eat his dinner.
Perhaps we should take him out of the show.
Take him out? Miss the show for the first time in years? Oh, no, no, no.
He will be all right. He is just a little bit stale.
No, he more than stale.
Don Diego, Furioso gives me a look.
I don't like it.
You are getting old, Casiano.
You are seeing things.
Furioso is entered in the show, and Furioso will be jumping Sunday, and will be taking the ribbon again.
If you'd honour me with a game of backgammon, we'll leave these two worriers to worry by themselves.
The old man, he's more stubborn than Furioso. Much more.
(PA) Categoría primera:
El caballo Simpático,
propiedad del Teniente Eugenio López.
That is a very good horse.
He is almost as good as Furioso.
- A plough horse.
- Oh, be reasonable, Papa.
I am the most reasonable man in the world, and I know horses.
I leave it to Señorita Cunningham if he comes within a thousand miles of Furioso.
Not within 10,000 miles.
Don't forget, I bring you up like my own son.
When you were a little baby horse, who feed you when your mama was sick?
Who sit up all night and rub your stomach when you got the belly ache?
No, I don't want you to thank me.
But, please, Furioso, if you love me, keep your mind on what you do today, huh?
All right.
Panchito.
Go on.
- Glenda, darling, what a surprise.
- Buenas tardes, Señorita Crawford.
Crawford?
- Your name is Crawford?
- Yes, but...
- Then this is all a trick. You lied to me.
- But...
You came to my house, you accepted my hospitality, and you lied to me.
- Blame me for that.
- I do blame you - to foster this, to encourage it behind my back, to bring the daughter of my worst enemy under my own roof.
I wanted you to know and like her. Has she changed because you know who she is?
Yes. I will not listen to you.
You are no son of your father. And she is...
Here, here! Hold your tongue, you old goat.
Even though you are a Crawford, you are a woman, and there is nothing I can do.
But I will ask your escort to answer for you.
Señor, my presence here is purely professional.
(PA) Yahora el famoso campeón por tres años consecutivos,
el caballo Furioso, propiedad del señor Diego Quintana.
He is rushing his jump.
Oh, Furioso, you're going to pieces.
You're supposed to be jumping.
Jumping! Jump!
What's the matter with your horse?
Does he think he's running a flat race?
(laughter)
- Papa.
- I want no comfort from you.
- I'm sorry.
- I do not want sympathy, Señorita Crawford.
- Papa.
- It's my fault, Ricardo.
No. It is mine.
We must win the race at San Isidro. It's our only chance to make this up to your father.
- Furioso is not going to race at San Isidro.
- What?
I'm sorry. I do not intend to go against my father again.
But we'll be doing this for him.
The best thing we can do for him is not to interfere.
But we can't leave things in the mess they're in.
- There is no point in making things worse.
- But how can they be worse?
I've already told you it was a mistake to go against my father in the first place.
I'm sorry, Ricardo. You're right.
There's no use in making things worse.
(rumba plays)
Come on. The plane leaves in two hours.
We haven't a moment to lose.
You can sleep after I'm gone.
Señorita, such energy.
Where does it keep coming from?
(doorbell)
Buenos días, Señorita Crawford, and here is a gift for going away.
How nice. Just what I need.
Since the suite will be vacant, do you mind if show it?
I'm having a rumba lesson. It's awkward.
Gracias. ¿Señor, quiere usted pasar?
This is the living room.
You will notice the bay window with the most beautiful look over the city.
- We've been trying to get you on the phone.
- Maybe that's why they said you were not in.
It wasn't important. We wanted to tell you we didn't want anything to do with you.
The bedroom is very notable for its built-in features. You...
- Con su permiso.
- Señor.
- This is the bedroom.
- How dare you come in here?
I am looking at this suite.
I'm going to move to town.
The bathroom's on a grand scale, also with a beautiful look over the city.
Glenda, I was wrong yesterday.
I have decided to race Furioso at San Isidro.
Glenda, please believe me.
I love you.
This time there's not the storm over the pampas. This time it is real.
As long as your father feels as he does about me, it won't work.
The odds are not as bad as that.
It's no worse than even-money he'll change if Furioso wins.
When he is standing there with the cup in his hands, how can he be angry?
No matter what he tells himself, he likes you.
And when he hears that it was your idea to race the horse, the fact you are a Crawford will be forgotten.
Señor, now that you have settled your personal problems, do you or do you not want this suite?
Of course we want it.
Señorita Crawford is going to stay.
Señor, if I understand you correctly, and I do, even so, you will have to register in the proper manner.
(fanfare)
Casiano!
Casiano, where are you, old man?
Casiano!
Casiano!
Casi...
- Did you call?
- Not for you. Where is Casiano?
- Casiano has gone to the west pasture.
- Why did he not consult me first?
Tell Panchito to bring Furioso out.
Go on. ¡Anda! ¡Anda!
Perdone, patrón. Panchito has taken
Furioso to the north pasture.
Why would he do a thing like that?
I'll look at the alfalfa.
Get me Cipriano and Machito.
Siento mucho, señor, but they have gone to the east pasture.
West pasture, north pasture, east pasture.
What has happened?
María! What pasture is she in?
She has gone to visit her mother.
Her mother has been dead five years.
I know it. I buried her.
You are lying, Esteban. Speak up before I shake the ears off your head.
I will tell you, Don Diego.
They have gone to San Isidro.
- The racetrack? Why would they go there?
- I don't know.
- You do. You lie. Answer or I'll strangle you.
- They've gone to see Furioso run.
Furioso in a flat race? Who did that?
Who would dare to do that?
Ricardo, Casiano and Señorita Cunningham.
They've trained him for the handicap.
¡Pedazo de animal!
Why did you not tell me?
I was not going to deceive you.
I was to tell you in half an hour, when it'd be too late to take him out of the race.
- ¡Animal! ¡Anda! Get my hat! Get my gun!
- Sí, señor.
It gives me great pleasure to have a Quintana horse in the handicap.
Muchas gracias, Señor Rosales. I hope he's not the only one who gets pleasure out of it.
Vete, caballo.
Do not get nervous, Furioso.
Listen. This race like the race in the village, only here they got more people. Understand?
- Unsaddle that horse.
- Wait, Casiano.
Papa, Furioso is a racehorse.
You developed a certain bloodline.
You worked till you had a horse as great as
Tempestad. You have one who's greater.
Oh, you've gone against me once too often, and I've nothing to say to you now, or ever.
Unsaddle that horse!
Come on. There is nothing more to be done.
Don Diego, for 40 years I work for you, never I say anything like this.
When you keep a horse in the barn on handicap day, when he runs the mile in 1:36, you are a... you are a criminal.
Hold your tongue, old man.
- Did you say 1:36?
- Sí.
Three time. Three.
With the horses like he run with today, he break a world record.
- 1:36?
- Sí. 1:36.
I've changed my mind, Casiano.
- ¡Que suba!
- Sí. ¡Que suba!
Ponga su dinero y ganará con él.
Buena suerte que le dé.
Hurry, you imbeciles! We will be too late.
Casiano. How much money have you got?
Oh, money. Plenty money, Don Diego.
Eight pesos.
Oh, I'm not after feed for chicken.
I need money.
- Quintana. I never expected to see you here.
- Martínez, I need a little cash.
Sure. Everything for an old friend.
How much? 100 pesos is enough?
- How much have you got?
- Give me all of it.
- You gonna bet all this money?
Hey, you must have a tip.
It is my own horse, Furioso. He has done the mile in 1:36 in his workouts. Gracias.
Julio. Just a minute.
Can you lend me a little cash?
- How much?
- All you got. I send you a cheque.
This has been a very bad day for me today.
All I have is 800 pesos.
- Don't tell me you'll bet all this?
- No. This is an investment.
I put all this money in Furioso. He has broken the world record in his workout.
- ¡Muchas gracias!
- Sí, Alberto. Por favor.
- Señorita.
- Tito.
Now, here. There's your cut. Now, you haven't lost a race all day. How do you do it?
It is simple. I eliminate all guesswork.
I have a cousin and an uncle who work around the stables. They'll stoop to anything.
They sound charming. When your mother's out of the Bastille I'll have you all over for tea.
Gracias, señorita.
With my winnings, may I buy you a drink?
Aren't you nice? First I want to bet everything I've got on Furioso.
Well, he's 80 to one now.
Wait. He may go to 100.
Wonderful! That would be like having our own printing press.
- Cinco, Tortilla.
- Carlos, no.
It's in the bag for Furioso.
Number three. Don't tell a soul.
- Did he say Furioso?
- It's in the bag. Number three.
Furioso. Sí, Furioso.
- Furioso, cinco ganadores.
- (man) Sí.
Furioso.
Furioso.
- Furioso.
- Furioso. Dos ganadores.
- Bet on Furioso.
- I know. I gave you the tip.
- (man) Señorita.
- Señorita.
- You haven't bet yet?
- No. The odds are dropping.
Do not put a nickel on Furioso.
- Tortilla is the one.
- What's wrong with Furioso?
I don't know. I learned by experience never to go against my uncle's tips.
You've been right every race.
I won't change touts in mid-afternoon.
- 50,000 pesos on Furioso.
- Oh, señor.
- You haven't heard that your horse will lose.
- What?
Now that you're going to bet 50,000 pesos on Furioso,
I've got it straight from the feedbox he'll be missing at the finish.
Señorita, there is no one whose opinion interests me less than yours.
- 50,000 pesos on Furioso.
- 10,000 on Tortilla.
Don Diego, something terrible happened.
Very bad.
They make crooked business against you.
They take Panchito off Furioso.
Panchito? Then what is he doing on the horse's back?
No, that's not Panchito. That's anotherjockey.
That is what that Crawford woman meant, and she had the nerve to tell me what she was going to do.
At first, I want to take Furioso out of the race, then this boy come tell me he ride good.
I told Furioso everything what happened.
He understand this serious time.
He gonna be all right.
Maybe this boy can ride good.
- I knew you would put Furioso in the race.
- Don Diego, I am so glad.
I have no doubt you are glad, señorita, with a strange jockey on Furioso's back.
He did that deliberately. He is tiring him out.
It is all part of the dastardly scheme. I might have expected as much from Crawfords.
- How can you say that, Papa?
- How can I say it?
That aunt of hers was brazen enough to say it to my face.
I'll put an end to this. I'm going to stop it.
No, Don Diego, it is no good.
They will be started before you get there.
Later on we will kill a couple of people.
Furioso is in front!
He is the smartest horse in the world.
He remembers all my instruction.
Look - he do everything I told him.
Come on, Furioso!
For a horse that was going to lose,
Furioso's doing all right.
It is the finish that counts, and that has been arranged.
My uncle took care of that personally.
You worm. If I'd known you'd do anything to that horse, I'd have run you off the track.
Your money is on Tortilla.
You are taken care of.
- I'll take care of you after the race. Furioso!
- Come on, Tortilla!
- Furioso!
- Tortilla! Furioso!
Come on, Furioso!
Look how he holds him.
He's breaking his neck.
All of the horses have passed him.
Oh! I think maybe he's got the bit in his teeth.
Yeah, yeah, he got the bit in his teeth.
Oh-ho-ho, nobody stop him now! Nobody!
Go, Furioso!
Come on, Furioso.
Come on, Furioso!
Come on, Furioso.
Furioso!
He... he win.
- Oh, Furioso. They could not beat him.
- He had to win.
Furioso, he wanted to be a racehorse all the time.
Crooked people, crooked jockey, don't mean nothing to him, nothing.
- I said Glenda had nothing to do with this.
- She tried.
Oh, Glenda.
I just discharged Tito with my own hands.
After all I've been to him, he turns out to be a horse fixer. He switched jockeys on Furioso.
- The Crawfords had nothing to do with this.
- They might have.
I'm tired of this. For years you've told how my father cheated you.
Well, I've found out what really happened.
- Here is a letter from my father.
- Why should we go into all that now?
I am a broadminded man.
We will let bygones be bygones.
No, we won't.
When your father was in school at Paris he got mixed up with a girl from the rue St Augustine.
He wanted to marry her.
My father took her to Capri for a weekend.
The reason was to keep your father from making a fool of himself.
That is his story. If he told the truth, he would tell how he stayed three weeks in Capri.
That is unforgivable.
Papa, let's the four of us go and have some champagne in the clubhouse, huh?
Sí.

Thank you, sir.
All right, my dear.
Mister!
Mister!
Are you Mr. Wilson?
Yes.
Are you the president of Princeton?
Yes.
Why the heck don't you get a football team?
I've been thinking about that myself, young man.

Mr. Wilson in?
Yes, sir.
Will you tell him, please, that senator
Edward Jones would like to see him?
Will you come in, please?
Thank you.
[Pianist playing the old folks at home]
Will you come into the study?
Is that him?
Yes.
What kind of a Professor is he?
Shh.
I'll tell
Mr. Wilson you're here.
Thank you.
Hmm. Not a bad layout for a schoolteacher.
The college owns it.
They just let him live here.
You know, I think it'd be kind of nice if the state did something like this for us boys.
"History of the American people,
"constitutional government...
Mere literature."
Say, did you know he wrote these himself?
Good evening, gentlemen.
Good evening, Professor.
I am senator Jones.
Big ed?
[Laughing]
That's right.
This is my nephew
Jim beeker.
How do you do, sir?
My old friend ed Sullivan.
Professor Wilson.
Mr. Sullivan.
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Excuse me, senator.
I'll take your coat.
Yes. Thanks.
Well, senator, what can I do for you?
Mr. Wilson, how would you like to be governor of new Jersey?
Governor?
There's a strong progressive movement running in this country.
People are looking for a change.
Yes, but why me?
I'm not a politician.
No, but your fight to abolish these social clubs and run Princeton on an equal footing for everybody has a lot of people talking.
I was under the impression
I'd been defeated in that fight.
[Senator]
Oh, people don't take those schoolboy matters as seriously as you do,
Professor.
All they can see is that you're against special privilege.
That's enough for them.
Besides, your books on how to run a government are known all over the world.
Oh, you read my books,
Mr. Sullivan?
Well, I, uh...
Let's say we've heard them spoken of very highly.
Of course, gentlemen, this is all very flattering, but to be perfectly Frank with you, senator, you're barking up the wrong tree.
I'm a schoolteacher, which must make me something of an idiot in the eyes of a lot of good people.
Ha ha.
Ha ha.
It's even worse.
I'm a Southern democrat in a yankee stronghold.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
We just won't tell anybody about that,
Professor.
Besides, you must realize this isn't the sort of decision
I can make overnight.
Take your time,
Professor.
There's no hurry.
Convention's still a long way off.
We won't take any more of your time.
We know how busy you are.
Here you are, sir.
Thank you, Sullivan.
I'm going to say it.
I'd be afraid...
Mr. Wilson,
I have a feeling that this casual meeting will be the beginning of a delightful association for all of us.
Indeed, it is the beginning of a new era in the state of new Jersey, one upon which we will all look back with everlasting pride.
Good night, sir.
Good night, senator.
And you will think it over,
Professor?
I'll do better than that, senator.
I'll have my wife think it over.
Good night.
Good night, Mr. Wilson.
Was that really big ed himself?
In person.
What did he want?
Oh, nothing of any importance.
He... he merely wants me to run for governor.
Governor?
Jerusalem!
You governor?
And why not?
What did you tell him?
Oh, that
I'd think it over and, of course, ask your permission.
Woodrow, you didn't.
Have I ever done anything foolish without asking your permission?
Woodrow,
I know you haven't any personal ambition just to hold office, but you must admit the opportunity is rather unusual.
So it is.
So it is.
You must get awfully tired sometimes of a mere talking profession.
You're quite right, my dear.
I will admit there are moments when the academic life has its drawbacks, but the idea of a man my age suddenly giving up a nice, comfortable way of life and launching out on a sea of ifs and buts sounds like the account of a fool.
But you've always been interested in politics.
Only as an observer on the sidelines, my dear.
How about the time you were a student at the university of Virginia and wrote your father that you'd decided to be a senator?
And had cards printed...
"senator Thomas woodrow Wilson."
A youthful indiscretion.
I was young then, young lady.
Very young.
About your mental age.
Besides, you know perfectly well
I have certain responsibilities to Princeton.
You know your work at Princeton is done.
You believe in the principles of Democratic equality, the abolition of any special privileged class.
If these things are worthwhile, don't they apply to all the people, not just to Princeton?
You mean you really think
I should seriously consider it?
Oh, I do, woodrow.
I most assuredly do.
We all do, father.
We all do.
You'd make a beautiful governor.
Of course.
I declare,
I never met such a collection of ambitious women in my life.
If I do go into this...
And mind you,
I'm not saying I will...
I warn you and you and you and you, you'll have to kiss all the babies.
That's one thing
I draw the line on.
[Laughter]
How about a locomotive?
You ready?
Hip! Hip!
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Sis sis sis!
Boom boom boom ba!
Princeton!
Princeton!
Princeton!
Yay!
Yay!
Do you really think they'll like him?
Mother, stop worrying.
They'll love him.
But he's never had any experience with people like these before.
Neither have they had any experience with a man like father before.
[Band stops playing]
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm going to let you in on a little secret.
Many of my friends are very much worried about this campaign.
They tell me
I'm conducting it in the worst possible way because, it appears,
I'm asking you people to think.
[Crowd laughs]
On the other hand, my opponents are even more worried because they expected my speeches to be mere academic lectures on government filled with glittering generalities that have nothing to do with the situation in new Jersey.
Apparently, they've deluded themselves into thinking that I have no political experience.
Good heavens.
No political experience?
I wonder if these gentlemen have ever attended a faculty meeting or seen the wives of the trustees in action.
[Laughing]
That's all very amusing,
Mr. Wilson.
But why don't you tell us what kind of deal you've made with the bosses?
Sit down!
Sit down!
I've made no deal with anyone.
I suppose you're going to deny that there's even such a thing as a boss system in new Jersey!
No. The existence of the boss system is notorious.
Then what are you going to do about it?
Bend all my energies to breaking it up!
[Cheering and applause]
When you say bosses, do you mean big ed Jones,
Jim beeker, and ed Sullivan?
Who's that?
Joe tumulty, one of them Irish lawyers in the legislature.
Claims to be a democrat, but he ain't voted right once.
Come on!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Keep quiet, you hear?
[Woman]
Aah!
Quiet!
Everybody, quiet!
All right.
Go ahead.
Thank you, judge.
Of course
I mean big ed.
I feel about him exactly as I feel about every other boss, whether he's a democrat or a republican.
Yay!
Yay!
Senator Jones understands exactly how I feel.
In fact, just so there would be no misunderstanding about it, he has given me his word that in no circumstances would he permit his name to be presented to the legislature as a candidate for re-election to the United States senate, an office for which
I consider him utterly unfitted.
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!
What do you say, big ed?
Heh heh heh heh.
I say the candidate speaks for the party.
Yay!
Yay!
[Band plays]
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Sis sis sis!
Boom boom boom ba!
Princeton!
Princeton!
Princeton!
Yay!
Yay!
Mother!
Suppose somebody sees you.
Let them!
Great, great. He'll win.
Yeah? Suppose he means it?
Nonsense. They had him in a corner.
What else could he say?
Just the same,
I don't like the cut of that fellow's jaw.
I tell you, he's something new in politics...
A scholar and a gentleman with ideals and principles.
You can't beat that when it comes to electioneering.
Wasn't he wonderful?
The most idiotic campaign speech in the whole history of politics.
I don't understand.
He means what he says.
Gentlemen!
Your attention, please!
9:18 P.M.
Returns from
22 counties.
Wilson leading by 40,000.
Majority!
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!
Good work, boys.
I'm proud of you.
* for he's a jolly good fellow *
* for he's a jolly good fellow *
* for he's a jolly good fellow *
* which nobody can deny nice smile now.
Get closer.
Mr. Wilson, will you step on the other side?
All of you, look this way, please.
Where do you expect to live, Mrs. Wilson?
We haven't made our plans yet.
What will you girls wear to the inauguration?
We haven't decided.
What jewelry will you wear?
None.
That's right.
The Wilson girls don't believe in jewelry.
We do. We just haven't any.
If you'll step over here...
What's your first move, governor?
Have you made any appointments?
Gentlemen, if you'll wait a minute,
I'll be glad to write out a statement.
Just give us some personal stuff.
Quite an upset,
Professor.
Any election's an upset, young man, if you're unfortunate enough to be elected.
Lean closer to Mrs. Wilson, governor.
I have to put up with this in my home?
Every day until the end of your life.
You might as well get used to it.
Smile.
Hold still!
The legislature has had sufficient time to digest the contents of this bill, gentlemen.
Therefore, I must insist that it be brought to a vote immediately regardless of the opposition.
You're right.
We have the votes.
Let's go ahead and let them howl.
Excuse me.
Yes, tumulty?
Senator Jones has arrived...
With Mr. beeker.
Thank you, tumulty.
Send them in, please.
Will you gentlemen excuse me?
Surely, governor.
Good morning, governor.
Good morning, senator.
Mr. beeker.
Sit down, gentlemen.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Well, you sent for me, governor?
Yes.
Did you authorize this statement to the effect that you have decided to be a candidate for the
United States senate?
At the insistence of many of my friends, governor.
But you publicly stated that in no circumstances would you be a candidate.
A man says a lot of things in the heat of a campaign.
To go back on your word so soon after the election would be outrageous and indecent.
Oh, come, come, come, governor.
People don't take these matters as seriously as you do.
They've probably forgotten all about it.
I beg to differ with you, senator.
I haven't forgotten, nor have the people.
Surely if the party feels
Uncle Ed's their man...
Those who elected me have already decided he's not.
Hold on, governor.
Let's get one thing clear.
I nominated you.
I elected you.
Then you should've exercised better judgment in your choice.
Would you be satisfied to announce your opposition publicly and let it go at that?
If you insist on going through with such bald-faced deceit,
I shall have no recourse but to fight you with every means in my power.
Well, looks to me as if the Professor will give us the bum's rush and run this whole show himself.
I consider your language coarse and your manners offensive.
However, you seem to have grasped the idea perfectly.
I don't want to quarrel with you, governor.
I know how seriously you take all these reform issues and how hard you've worked.
What you need is a nice, long rest.
Good day, senator.
Be sensible, governor.
We know you're aiming for the white house.
What chance would you have for the nomination if your state organization's against you?
Get out.
You're no gentleman.
You're no judge.
I still don't understand it.
He seemed like such a nice fellow, too.
I told you
I didn't like the cut of that fellow's jaw.
What gets me is the way the newspapers around the country are picking this up, making him a hero.
Be just like that darn convention to nominate him for president now, whether we like it or not.
The Republicans split wide-open between
Teddy Roosevelt and taft, they can elect him, too.
Well, if you ask me, that would be a whole lot better than having him hanging around new Jersey.
Yes, I'll tell governor Wilson you called the moment he returns.
[Knock on door]
Come in.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Yes, thank you, sir.
Hello, boys.
Hello, tumulty.
What's that?
More applications for the Wilson for president clubs.
There's Rochester and Atlanta and oyster bay.
What?
That's Teddy Roosevelt's hometown.
Well, uh, I come from there too, Mr. tumulty.
[Ring]
Governor Wilson's office.
This is his secretary.
Oh, yes, congressman.
How do you do? Sorry.
The governor's out of town at the moment on an important mission.
I wish I could tell you where he is, but it's something very close to his heart, something I'm sure you'd approve of.
[Orchestra plays moonlight bay]
* we were sailing along
* on moonlight bay
* we could hear the voices singing *
* they seemed to say
* you have stolen her heart *
* now, don't go away
* as we sang those old sweet songs *
* on moonlight bay
Henry.
Mr. Holmes.
A very important mission, hmm?
Official business, no doubt.
Yes, it's odd, but it seems something important like this comes up at least once a week.
Yes. Every time the palace changes its program.
You've taken to politics like a Billy goat to tin cans, raising Cain all over the place.
No wonder they want to kick you upstairs into the white house.
Don't take these
Wilson for president clubs too seriously.
Remember, a lot of people still regard me as a pretty dangerous fellow.
So you are, but it's too late.
I've already paid $5.00 to help bamboozle the public.
Just throwing it away.
Maybe, but Teddy Roosevelt's a Harvard man.
Bill taft's from Yale.
I'd give $5.00 of my money any day to let a Princeton boy have a crack at them in the same game.
Bully! Bully!
I'm de-lighted.
[Band plays dixie]
[Gavel pounds]
Quiet!
Order!
The delegates...
Will resume...
Their seats.
And the sergeant at arms will clear the aisle.
The chair has the honor...
To present to you...
That great democrat...
That fearless leader...
Who has never...
Sold the truth to serve the hour.
The great commoner himself...
Nebraska's favorite son...
William Jennings Bryan.
[Band plays onward Christian soldiers]
Mcadoo!
Mcadoo.
What is it,
Daniels?
Wilson's at the governor's mansion in sea girt.
Get him on the telephone.
I don't like the way this
Bryan thing is going.
Neither do I, but mccombs, his campaign manager, isn't worried.
It's too early.
Besides, every newspaper in New York has a direct wire to the governor's place.
He probably already knows what's going on.
[Typewriter]
That William
Jennings Bryan.
He's trying to steal the nomination for himself.
What's he done now, tumulty?
He's got his band playing hymns.
It is my great honor...
And distinguished privilege to place in nomination for the exalted office of president of the United States...
That great statesman from Alabama...
Oscar w. Underwood.
Yay! Yay!
Yay! Yay!
* I came from Alabama
* with a banjo on my knee
* I'm going to Louisiana
* my true love for to see... *
* I thought I saw susannah comin' down the hill *
* oh, susannah
* oh, don't you cry for me *
* I came from Alabama
* with a banjo on my knee *
* I came from Alabama.
I give you that great statesman from Missouri...
A great servant...
Of the common man...
The honorable champ Clark.
Yay! Yay!
Yay! Yay!
New Jersey appreciates the honor of placing...
Before this convention...
As a candidate...
For the presidency...
Of the United States...
The seer and philosopher...
Of Princeton...
The Princeton schoolmaster...
Woodrow Wilson.
[Band plays school days]
Governor!
Governor!
Here's the result of the first ballot...
Clark... 440,
Wilson... 324,
Underwood... 117.
Huh! Sounds like our golf score.
Thank you, tumulty.
Those reporters have been after me all morning.
Won't you say something?
Yes.
You may tell them that governor Wilson received the news of the first ballot in a riot of silence.
Fore!
Good-o.
The chair recognizes the leader of the New York delegation...
The honorable
Charles Murphy of tammany hall.
New York...
Wishes at this time...
To change its ballot and cast its 90 votes for the next president of the United States...
Champ Clark of Missouri.
Yay! Yay!
Yay! Yay!
Hello, Daniels.
Hello. Hello.
If they don't stop that fool song soon,
I'll get a real hound out there and kick him around.
You can't do that, josephus.
They'd lynch you, and we need every
Wilson vote we can get.
Yes?
What?
Oh.
Just a minute.
William mccombs, governor.
He wants to speak to you personally.
Hello, mccombs. I...
The jig's up, governor.
It looks like a stampede for Clark.
This last parade's gone on over an hour.
You've got to send me a wire withdrawing your name.
I can't hold your delegates any longer.
What's the score now?
Clark... 556,
Wilson... 350 1/2.
It's hopeless.
No candidate yet has ever received a majority without being nominated.
We should have made some kind of deal with that New York delegation.
What's Bryan going to do?
He's been hoping he could play you and Clark off against each other, then get the nomination himself, but it's too late.
We're licked.
It'll be Clark on the next ballot.
Just a minute.
Mccombs sounds pretty excited.
Thinks I should send a telegram releasing my delegates.
I knew it all along...
That tammany hall.
Now I know why the Democratic party picked a jackass for a mascot.
It's all right, woodrow.
At least we'll be able to get away for a holiday.
Thank you, my dear.
Hello, mccombs...
Hello?
Let me have that phone!
Governor.
Hello, governor.
William g. Mcadoo speaking.
I just heard what mccombs told you, but he's dead wrong.
You can't withdraw now.
Clark will never get a 2/3 vote.
Wait. If you don't believe me, here's josephus Daniels.
He'll tell you the same thing.
Hello. He's right, governor.
Mcadoo is right.
You're stronger than ever.
Your delegates will stick if it takes all summer.
Just a minute.
That's odd.
My convention manager tells me we're defeated.
Mcadoo and Daniels say I can't lose.
What do you think?
Stay in, by all means.
Certainly, governor.
What do you think,
Eleanor?
That you've nothing to lose by staying in.
That's what I think.
We'll stay in.
Hello, mcadoo.
Thank my friends.
Tell them we'll see it through.
The delegates will resume their seats...
And the sergeant at arms, clear the aisles!
Mr. chairman...
For what purpose does the gentleman from Nebraska arise?
To explain my vote!
Speaking for myself and for any of the delegation who may decide to join me,
I shall withhold my vote from champ Clark.
No! Boo!
Boo! No!
So long as New York's vote is recorded for him.
I...
Cast it for...
Nebraska's second choice...
Woodrow Wilson!
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!
[Band plays school days]
The next president of the United States!
The next president!

You've been nominated on the 46th ballot!
Oh, papa! Oh, daddy!
Congratulations, governor.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
[Playing hail to the chief]
They're playing hail to the chief.
Congratulations, governor.
Is this your work?
I've had them waiting two days.
What if I hadn't been nominated?
I made arrangements with them to fold up their tents like the arabs and silently steal away.
When I speak to you of business and government, of capital and labor, of privilege and equal opportunities, my only purpose...
Is to rehabilitate democracy and to prove to the world that the Democratic system can successfully meet the economic, industrial, and social problems that confront us.
Because I believe, as Lincoln did, that democracy...
With all its faults and failures, if properly guided and interpreted, holds the future of the world.
My great dream is...
That as the years go on, the world will turn to America more and more for those moral inspirations which lie at the basis of all freedom.
And that America...
Will come into the full light of the day when all the world shall know she puts human rights above all other rights and that her flag...
Is not only the flag of America, but the flag of humanity.
Yay! Yay!
Yay! Yay!
I thought you'd like to hear these.
"I cordially congratulate you on your election
"and extend to you my best wishes
"for a successful administration.

"The American people, by a great plurality,
"have conferred upon you the highest honor

"I congratulate you thereon.

Only a sense of solemn responsibility.

Only too well...
The very great task ahead of me.
And I look pleadingly to you, the young men of America...
To stand behind me...
To support me.
That's all I can say...

Mr. president,
I'm hoover, the chief Usher.
How do you do?
This is Mrs. Wilson.
How do you do,
Mr. hoover?
My daughters...
Miss jessie, miss Margaret, miss Ellen.
Perhaps you and Mrs. Wilson might like to inspect your living quarters before lunch.
Thank you. I would.
This way, please.
We'll take the elevator up.
It's this way, sir.
Big, isn't it?
[Laughter]
Who's this?
That's
Mrs. John Tyler.
Oh, yes.
Look, father, here's a picture of president taft.
Yes. Very good, too.
Oh, mother, it's lovely!
I thought it was going to be overpowering, and it's not at all.
It's just a home.
Does it amaze you that our predecessors had good taste?
Come see my room.
I'm sure it's where
Abigail Adams hung out her laundry.
That was the east room.
I looked it up.
Look!
Mistress Dolly Madison.
Don't anyone dare tell me she didn't sleep here.
Can't you almost feel them?
Heavens, you don't think the house is haunted?
A lot of them were extremely reluctant to leave here during their lifetime.
"Of January 1st, 1863,
"whereby four million slaves were given their freedom
"and slavery forever prohibited in the United States."
Imagine, and in my room.
Miss Nell, guess what.
They've got three automobiles here and an electric, and the chauffeur said we could use them whenever we wanted.
Not bad for a family that never even owned a horse and buggy.
Oh, I wish we would have an inaugural ball tonight.
It'd be such fun.
Father hates a lot of fuss.
I know, but tonight,
I wish he was a republican.
Shh!
President Lincoln's bed.
He must've been an awfully big man.
He was.
My dears, your father and I have a gift for each of you in commemoration of this day.
Oh, mother!
How sweet!
Oh, mother.
Oh, it's exquisite.
It's the most beautiful ring
I've ever seen.
Oh, a bracelet watch.
Mother, it's just what I've always wanted.
Ohh...
Oh, look.
Mother.
Diamond pendant.
Oh, it's too beautiful.
But why did you...
I mean, how did you...
I borrowed money from the bank to pay my campaign expenses, and this was left over.
Oh, woodrow, it's too nice.
Perhaps, but I've got a better job now...
Shorter hours, more pay.
[Knock on door]
Come in.
Excuse me,
Mr. president, but luncheon is served.
Oh, thank you...
Simms, sir.
Thank you, Simms.
Howdy, miss Ellen.
You don't remember me, do you?
Why, no, I...
My family lived right behind yours in Rome, Georgia.
My mother did your mother's washing for close on to 30 years, I reckon.
How nice to have someone from down home.
Yes, indeed, miss Ellen, it's going to be mighty nice for me, too, having ladies and gentlemen around that speak my language.
[Giggling]
I don't know what I came for.
He didn't want my advice.
Once he's made up his mind, nothing in heaven will change it.
Bye, Joe.
Goodbye, senator.
At least he listened to our side of it.
He was polite, but somehow he makes me feel like an unruly schoolboy.
I catch myself being afraid he's going to rap me over the knuckles.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Senator lodge.
Morning, senator.
Didn't expect to find you here.
Oh, yes. We Republicans still do business with the government...
Occasionally.
[Laughter]
Good morning, senator lodge.
Tumulty.
Will you announce me to the president?
Yes, of course, senator.
Won't you sit down, sir?
Thank you.
Awfully glad to see you back, colonel.
Glad to be back, thank you.
Colonel house.
Hello, tumulty.
Welcome home.
Come in.
The governor's waiting to see you.
Senator.
Colonel house.
Go right in, sir.
Oh, thank you.
I'm sorry, senator.
Colonel house just got back from Europe.
The president's anxious to see him.
You don't mind waiting, do you?
Not at all.
House.
Governor.
Welcome home.
Thank you.
My, I'm glad you're back.
Have you seen the morning paper, senator?
Yes.
* by the light

Ellen, come and help us out.
Oh, I can't.
I promised Helen we'd finish this list tonight.
Helen, I told you what you were getting into when you took this job as
Ellen's secretary.
Yes, cousin woodrow, but you didn't say what a white house wedding's like.
It's all jessie's fault.
If she hadn't decided to get married...
Well, I like that.
What about your own wedding?
That's different.
Mac lives here in Washington, but you have to marry someone that lives at the other end of nowhere.
Well, Helen, if these people are going to be blue,
I'd better join them.
Goodness only knows why they need my voice.
They know I never could sing a note.

I don't know.
I'm all right.
Come and sit down.
I'm just a little faint.
Get some water.
Mother, what is it?
I'm just a little dizzy, that's all.
You've been doing too much.
It's all this entertaining.
You can't keep it up.
Well, that's my job.
The president has to entertain.
Not if it's going to affect your health.
You'd better lie down.
Nonsense.
I feel perfectly all right.
I'll just sit here while you go on with your song.
Not tonight.
Please.
I insist.
It'll sound much better without me.
Please. Go on.

I wish you girls didn't feel you had to sit here with me.
Oh, mother, we like it here.
Your poor father.
He's hardly been out of that chair for a week.
Where's father now?
I made him lie down.
He looked so tired.
Besides, I wanted to speak to you girls alone.
Of course, I'm sure
I'm going to be all right, but if anything should happen to me,
I want you girls to promise me one thing.
Mother, don't even say such things.
Your father is a great man.
Promise me you won't let him be a lonely great man.
Mother.
Please.
More than anyone
I've ever known, he needs sympathy and loyalty, companionship.
He needs a woman's love and attention and understanding...
Someone he can turn to and trust.
A wife is as much a part of him as his very mind or heart.
I know... Because
I've been his wife.
Promise?
Of course we promise.
But, mother, it's ridiculous of you to talk like this.
You'll be up and about in no time.
You know it.
I'm sorry, Mr. president.
Excuse me, governor.
Senator Carter glass telephoned.
He wants to know, can he see you this afternoon about that federal reserve bank matter?
He'll have to excuse me.
I can think of nothing while
Ellen's like this.
All right, governor.
He'll understand.
Father, you promised mother you'd play golf this afternoon.
I know.
But I can't.
I can't bear the thought of her suffering.
Father, she wouldn't want you to feel like this.
She's always been the most radiant person I've known.
For 30 years,
I've never had a thought in which she didn't enter.
I can't...
I couldn't go on without her.
I'll never forget the first time
I ever saw her.
I was practicing law in Atlanta.
I had to go to Rome,
Georgia, on business.
Her father was the presbyterian minister.
I went to his church.
I'm afraid I couldn't have told you what the sermon was about.
She saw you, too.
She always said she was glad she had on her prettiest hat.
I don't think any two people were ever so happy.
When I was teaching at bryn mawr and at Princeton when you girls were babies...
It's this place that's killing her.
She's been happy here, father, and so proud of you.
No. She's done too much.
I didn't realize it.
She wouldn't have been happy doing any less.
Well, Grayson?
She's sleeping now.
So far as I can tell, there's been no great change since yesterday, just a gradual weakening.
There's no hope?
Medical science is not the last word,
Mr. president.
We can only wait and see.
[Singing hymn]
[Explosions and gunfire]
[Piano plays]
If there were only something we could do, some way we could help.
It's difficult.
Extra! Extra!
Lusitania torpedoed off coast of Ireland.
Over 100 American lives lost.
Extra! Extra!
Dirty huns!
Ought to be wiped out, the lot of them.
German sub sinks lusitania.
Over 1,500 die.
Lusitania torpedoed by German sub.
It's cold-blooded murder.
Wholesale slaughter.
[Ding ding]
We'll be at war with Germany in a week.
It's not our war.
Why should we get involved?
If Americans don't want to get hurt, let them stay home.
I bet Teddy Roosevelt would know what to do.
Over 100 American citizens murdered on the high seas, and that man in the white house too proud to fight.
But we have no choice.
These huns must be taught a lesson.
We can't watch the world slipping into anarchy.
We've got to declare war.
No, no, no!
Our people were warned to stay off that ship.
How do we know that it wasn't carrying munitions?
Nonsense. That's nothing but German propaganda.
Congress is all set to act.
It'll back us up.
What about the people?
Don't worry.
They're good and mad.
Read your newspapers.
Mr. president, do you know people are saying openly that this administration lacks courage?
They may call me a coward or anything else, but I won't be rushed into this war.
You'll overlook the most dastardly crime of which any civilized nation has ever been guilty?
No. I shall warn the German government in the strongest terms that in future it will be held to strict accountability.
Another note?
Yes. Another note.
These Germans pay no attention to notes.
The only thing they understand is force.
I'm not so much concerned with what the Germans do as I am with our own responsibility, which is to keep out of this war if possible, so that at the right time, we can offer ourselves as the only nation in the world with sufficient strength and influence to bring about a decent and lasting peace.
The vast majority of Americans expect me to keep my head and save them from this awful mess.
I don't want them to say when the casualty lists come in,
"why did Wilson have to move so fast?
Why didn't he make one more effort?"
Have you considered what this policy of uncertainty is doing to our economy?
Cotton down to 6 cents, our goods rotting on the docks, afraid to put to sea, our farmers and railroads facing ruin.
I haven't thought to consider this war in terms of dollars and cents.
Nor have the fathers and mothers of this country.
No, gentlemen.
It would be the easiest thing in the world for me as president to ask for a declaration of war.
The man on horseback is always a hero.
But I wouldn't have to do the fighting.
Some poor farmer's boy or the son of some great family would have to do the fighting and the dying.
When I ask them to do that,
I want to be very sure that what they're dying for is worthwhile.
Good morning.
[Typing]
Oh, thank you, my dear.
You really should be in bed, father.
It's very late.
Yes.
I'll go along directly.
It would be nice if we could run away from it all.
You know, once upon a time, your mother and I did just that.
I'd been working very hard on the first draft of mere literature.
Without telling anyone at the university, we slipped out for a holiday in the country...
And it was just about the most perfect two weeks
I've ever known.
We tramped in the hills, slept in the sun, and walked alone at night under the stars.
Your mother was a very wonderful woman,
Margaret.
She had that rare quality of always being close to you when you wanted her, when you needed her.
[Typing]
Extra! Extra!
Read all about it!
Germany agrees to quit submarine warfare!
Read all about it!
Germany agrees to quit submarine warfare!
Extra! Extra! Germany agrees to quit submarine warfare!
How long will Germany live up to it?
As long as it suits her convenience.
I suppose we'll have to go along with Wilson's preparedness program.
Not his preparedness program... ours.
We started it.
We pushed it when he would have nothing to do with it.
Now he's claiming it for himself because he thinks it's good politics.
Never mind that.
It has to be done.
Not only will we have to go along, but we'll have to lead the way, put aside any thought of party and do what we can to save this country.
Well, Mr. president,
Teddy Roosevelt can't say that you haven't adopted at least one of his policies.
Thank you, Joe.
What's that?
The strenuous life.
Oh, it's the president.
And looking the worse for wear, I'm afraid.
Hello, cousin woodrow.
Come in. Come in.
Cousin woodrow,
I want you to know my friend Mrs. galt.
I'm delighted,
Mrs. galt.
Mr. president.
You know Dr. Grayson.
Very well, for a long time.
Have you forgotten?
I introduced you to Edith.
Oh, yes.
Yes, of course.
We've been for a walk in the rain.
Edith came here for tea with Margaret and me.
Tea? Sounds delicious.
May we come, too?
Shall we let them?
As patriotic citizens,
I don't see how we can very well say no.
You're from the South,
Mrs. galt?
Yes. I have the honor to be born in the same state as you... Virginia.
She's a descendant of pocahontas.
Well, that is Virginia.
We shan't keep you waiting long.
Oh, don't hurry. Give us time to freshen up a bit.
Excuse me.
Charming woman.
Very.
Do you play golf,
Mrs. galt?
Oh, yes, Mr. president.
And this will give you an idea how well.
The last time, I was
200 yards from the green.
I asked my caddie if he thought
I could make it with my mashie, and he replied,
"yes, ma'am, you can make it, allowing you hits it often enough."
We're going down the potomac next weekend on the yacht.
Would you care to join us?
Oh, I'd love to, but I promised to visit the Hastings in Virginia.
That's a shame. I'd hoped you could come.
Cousin woodrow will be terribly disappointed.
The president asked for me?
"You're the only woman I know
"who can wear an orchid.
Generally, it's the orchid that wears the woman."
I think this is my favorite spot at the white house.
It is lovely.
I asked Margaret and the others to leave us alone for a while that I might have an opportunity to say something to you.
Yes?
I need you, Edith.
Will you be my wife?
Mr. president.
I know this comes as a shock to you.
Perhaps I've been too impulsive, but if I'm to continue to make opportunities to see you,
I must speak.
But how can you be sure?
You've only known me a few months.
Time isn't always measured in weeks or months.
In the past year,
I've lived a lifetime of loneliness and heartache.
You've changed all that, given me hope that happiness is still possible.
Have you spoken to your daughters?
Yes.
They tell me they already love and admire you and that nothing would make them happier.
But I've never thought of you except as the president.
And, besides,
I've had no training that would befit me for the responsibilities of such a life.
Would you rather
I had not spoken?
Oh, no.
There isn't any woman who wouldn't be touched to be told that she could be of help to a man in your position in times like these...
But I'd have to have time to know you and to see you and to be with you.
Do you want to see me?
Yes, I do.
Then I'll wait...
And in all fairness to you, there's something you should understand.
There's a spotlight on this house.
Everyone who comes here is observed and discussed.
Everything I say is quoted...
Sometimes even correctly.
No matter how I try,
I can't protect you from gossip.
I'm not afraid of gossip.
It would be even worse if I came to your house.
But surely you have the right to choose your own friends.
In this job, I'm not sure
I have any rights at all.
This gossip you speak of, would it hurt you, what you're doing?
It's you I'm thinking of.
Well, then, I suggest we go on exactly as we have in the past...
But as to being your wife, if I have to say yes or no now, then I'm afraid the answer must be no.
Won't you at least give me the hope that you might change your mind...
That maybe when you know me better...
I'd be less than a woman,
Mr. president, if I didn't reserve that right.
[Take me out to the ballgame plays]
Mr. president.
Yay!
Yay!
That's her.
Yes. An election coming up, too.
There's no use beating about the bush, Edith.
You know about the whispers, the gossip that's going on.
He heard about it today.
Naturally, he would be the last to hear.
I've never seen him so angry in my life.
His lips went white.
His hands shook.
I think if he could get his hands on those scandalmongers, he'd forget he's president.
Oh, no, he mustn't do that.
What's worse, some of his own friends are mixed up in it.
They're afraid that a second marriage will prevent his re-election.
What do you think?
That his own political fortunes don't make any difference to him.
It's you.
Nothing must stand in the way of his re-election.
I'd never forgive myself if I were the cause of his defeat.
Edith, he's the president of the United States, but first of all, he's a man, and he loves you.
To do what he has to do, he... he needs you.
Thank you, Dr. Grayson.
It was very kind of you to tell me all this.
I'll write him my decision.
Thanks, Edith.
[Typing]
Hello, Joe, what's the news?
Not a thing.
How's with you?
Oh, all right.
Mm-hmm.
No notes to Germany?
Nope.
No sinkings?
No.
No messages to congress about us being too proud to fight?
Sorry. Just the usual routine.
Jumping Jupiter!
What? What is it?
What's the matter?
The story. The list.
The announcement has just been made of the engagement of Mrs. Norman galt of Washington, D.C.
And woodrow Wilson, president of the United States.
[Hail to the chief plays]
[Applause]
His imperious majesty appears to be in good spirits tonight.
Time will remedy that.
Do you really think we have a chance to defeat him in November?
Not defeat, senator, obliterate.
You can't enjoy the convention without a hot dog!
Buy it hot! Buy it now!
* we take out hats off to you,
Mr. Wilson *
* our hats are off to you
* you're the man of the hour *
* you stood like a tower

* in the right kind of place *

He kept us out of war!
Woodrow Wilson is the most incompetent...
Vacillating...
Insincere...
And cowardly leader this nation has ever endured!
He kept us out of war!
Wilson and his dynasty, his heirs and assigns, anybody who with bended knee has served his purposes, must be driven from all control, from all influence upon the government of the United States!
While we watch a world in flames, we must not forget what is happening here at home under our very noses.
Private initiative is being stifled, business is being put into a straitjacket, all under this false claim that this is democracy.
When, as a matter of fact, it is nothing but the blundering of a starry-eyed idealist.
Re-elect woodrow Wilson!
He kept us out of war!
[Playing dixie]
"A weak and imbecile man,"
"the weakest I ever knew in a high place."
"If I wanted to paint a despot,
"a man perfectly regardless
"of every constitutional right of the people,
I would paint his hideous form."
That's outrageous!
"When he goes out of office next march,
"the whole country except thieves, cowards,
"public plunderers, officeholders, and traitors will rejoice."
Woodrow, that's the last straw.
You've got to do something about it.
They've no right to say such things about you even to win an election.
They weren't talking about me.
That's what they said about Abraham Lincoln when he was running for re-election in 1864.
[Laughter]
I understand
Teddy Roosevelt says you're the most incompetent man to ever occupy the office, worse even than
Thomas Jefferson.
[Laughter]
Frankly, I've been much more concerned with what our own side's been saying.
All this prating about "he kept us out of war," as if I can see what is or is not to be.
Any little German lieutenant can put us into the war tomorrow by some new outrage on the sea tonight.
Would you mind very much if you should be defeated?
I don't suppose any man wants to see his policies repudiated.
I heard that betting in wall street closed at 10-8 against you, father.
I hope you didn't take any of it.
Governor.
Yes, tumulty?
Governor, the New York times has just conceded the election to Mr. Hughes.
Why, it's only 9:00.
How can they be sure?
They're still at the polls in the west.
Yes...
It does seem a bit early.
Coffee, tumulty?
Thank you, governor.
However, the times is generally right.
In the meanwhile,
I see no reason to despair.
The government's not going to collapse just because I've been left at home.
Hughes is an honest man and a very capable one.
As a matter of fact, his own party referred to him as Wilson-with-whiskers.
With whiskers.
Of course, my wife may feel the country's judgment's a bit warped.
I can only think that you'll be free from all this worry.
Waiting for election returns is like a hen sitting on a nest, except that the hen uses better judgment than a politician...
She never cackles until after she's laid the egg.
[Laughter]
May we talk to Mr. Hughes?
The president has gone to bed.
He has left word that he was not to be disturbed.
Well, when the president wakes up, give him this and tell him you're not so sure he's president after all.
Thank you.
Well, Mr. president, we can do this all over again.
Another four years.
Yes, another four years.
Congratulations,
Mr. president, and the public's to be congratulated, too...
For their good judgment.
Thank you.
I never gave up for one minute.
I did. I'd have sold out pretty cheaply election night.
You just got by in the electoral college, but you polled three million more popular votes than in 1912, and that's not to be laughed at.
Why on earth any man should want a job like this for another four years is beyond me.
[Laughter]
But I confess,
I did want it.
Mr. president.
Baker.
Mr. secretary.
Has the president retired?
Yes, sir.
Wake him.
Tell him Mr. Lansing, secretary of state, his excellency count Von bernstorff, the German ambassador, are here, and that we must see him at once.
Will you wait in the east room, sir?
Thank you.
Mr. president.
Mr. Lansing.
Your excellency.
What is it, gentlemen?
I'm sorry to disturb you at such an hour, but count Von bernstorff has just handed me another note from his government.
Beginning tomorrow,
Germany will resume its policy of unrestricted submarine warfare.
We have no other choice.
And will sink on sight and without warning any neutral vessel entering European waters.
With certain exceptions, of course.
One American ship will be permitted to leave a designated port each week, provided it is properly lighted and marked.
We deeply regret the necessity of this decision.
We sincerely hope it will not interfere with your noble efforts to bring about peace with our enemies.
Sit down, sir.
We also have received indisputable proof within the last hour that the German government has been using our own state department cables to foment trouble between this country and Mexico.
What?
With California, new Mexico, and parts of Texas as bait.
I deny any such thing.
The proof is overwhelming,
Mr. president.
There can be no doubt.
Count Von bernstorff...
For more than two years, this government has exercised every restraint in its efforts to remain neutral in this conflict, but you and your military masters apparently are determined to deny us that right.
But I assure you...
Every way we turn, we run into a blank wall of German cruelty and stupidity.
Every time we think we've escaped, you blindly and deliberately block us with some new outrage.
Mr. president...
Sit down.
Won't you Germans ever be civilized?
Won't you ever learn to keep your word...
Or to regard other peoples as men, women, and children, not as inferiors to be treated as you please, in the name of your discredited
German culture and race superiority?
I wish to withdraw...
We are not exactly fools!
We know about the spies you've sent among us in an effort to corrupt our opinions through lies and rumors and of your ceaseless attempts to sabotage our industry and commerce.
Unfortunately, some of our own people have fallen in with your plans.
Day after day,
I see them going up and down this country, crying out in their innocence that this is just another European war that can't touch America, building up a false illusion of safety and security, appealing to our ancient traditions of isolation...
While you smile behind their backs and go right ahead with your evil plans of world conquest and exploitation.
I bid you good night.
You will wait!
Is your kaiser so contemptuous of American military prowess?
Does he think we're so weak and disunited just because we prefer peace to war that we will not fight in any circumstances?
Or is he so drunk with power that he can't understand that such action will unite this nation as never before in its history and that he has made it clear at last that this is, in truth, a fight for freedom and decency against the most evil and autocratic power this world has ever seen?
Mr. Lansing.
Mr. president.
You will hand his excellency count Von bernstorff his passports immediately.
Good night, sir.

* glory, glory hallelujah *
* his truth is marching on *
* glory, glory hallelujah *
* his truth is marching on * with a profound sense of the solemn...
And even tragic character of the step
I am taking...
And of the grave responsibilities which it involves,
I advise that the congress declare the recent course of the imperial
German government to be in fact nothing less than war against the government and people of the United States and that it formally accept the status of belligerency which has thus been thrust upon it.
Whoo!
In so doing, let us make clear to all the world what our motives and objectives are.
We have no selfish ends to serve.
We desire no conquest, no dominion, no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make.
We are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind.
We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and freedom of nations can make them.
It is a fearful thing to lead this great, peaceful people into war.
But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts...
For democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own government, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself, at last, free.
Through such a task, we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes...
Everything we are...
And everything that we have...
With the pride of those who know that the day has come when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness...
And the peace which she has treasured.
God helping her, she can do no other.

Good heavens. How many second lieutenants are there?
[Knock on door]
Excuse me, father.
There's someone here who wants to say goodbye to you.
Come in. Come in.
Felton.
Hello, Mr. president.
Mrs. Wilson.
Congratulations, lieutenant.
Thank you.
I don't want to take your time,
Mr. president.
I just wanted to say so long before I shoved off.
You're leaving soon?
I'm afraid that's a military secret, sir.
Yes.
Yes. Quite right, too.
Well, take care of yourself, felton.
Yes, sir, I will.
And... Don't be too impatient with us.
No, sir.
I'll try not to be.
Well, son...
Goodbye.
Goodbye, sir.
Goodbye, lieutenant, and... Good luck to you.
Thank you.
Thank you for coming to see me.
Thank you very much.
Very much.
Goodbye, sir.
[Door closes]
It's her,
I tell you.
Oh.
It couldn't be.
I'm sure of it.
Ah, don't kid me.
Why don't you go and ask her?
Find out for yourself.
O.K., I will.
Thank you, ma'am.
Lady...
Coffee.
They've been trying to tell me that you're the president's wife.
Really?
They can't string me.
You don't think
I look the part?
I say you don't.
I agree, but when you come back from France, if you come to the white house,
I'll do my best to look as I should, or better still, speak to the president himself about it.
There he is.
Slippery, aren't they?
I'll get you another.
You are the... the...
Even the president has to do kp occasionally.
Hiya,
Mr. president.
How are you, young man?
I never thought
I'd be shaking hands with you.
I can't wait to write home about this.
Only they'll never believe it.
Hello, Mr. president.
Where are you from?
Milwaukee, sir.
German?
My father was German.
I'm just an American.
And you?
My name's vespucci, but I'm just an American, too.
I guess there's something funny about all of us.
Mike here's a bohunk.
Me? I'm just Irish.
Tex here claims he's just from plain Texas.
Nobody told me any different yet.
Well, this is all very interesting, boys.
I want you to remember it.
Here we are, men of all races, with different backgrounds and ancestries, working together for a common purpose.
That's what's made
America what it is, and that's what the whole world must learn to do someday.
I know there are people who say this is just another war to protect the great fortunes or for some other economic reason, but don't believe them.
If anybody tries to tell you that universal peace is just an idle dream...
Tell him he's a liar.
Say your president said that you're fighting this war so there won't have to be any more wars, and that when we get through with it, we're going to sit down with other people who feel as we do and work out some plan which will make it unnecessary for boys like you and your sons to have to go out and shoot one another.
Maybe we'll call it a... a league, maybe something else, but whatever it is, that's what you're going to France for, and with the help of God, that's what you're going to get.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Company, fall in!
All right.
Get back on the train!
What are you trying to do, hold up the war?
Take it easy. We've just been talking to the president.
Says you!
All right, you...
See?
What did I tell you?
Carry on, sergeant.
Yes, sir.
All right, men.
Get back on the train.
So long, soldiers.
Goodbye.
Goodbye,
Mr. president.
Don't you worry about this war.
We'll take care of it for you.
Thank you, soldier.
Bye, sir.
For our part, we see very clearly that unless justice is done to others, it will not be done to us.
The program of the world's peace, therefore, is our program, and that program...
The only possible program...
Is based, as we see it, on these 14 points.
Open covenants openly arrived at.
Freedom of the seas.
Self-determination.
Free trade.
An impartial adjustment of all colonial claims.
League of nations.
Did you bring this month's casualty figures, Baker?
Yes, sir.
This is not one of my most pleasant tasks,
Mr. president.
I know.
112,000 of our boys dead so far.
That's only an approximation,
Mr. president.
All the figures are not in.
183,612 wounded.
The fighting's been heavy, almost ceaseless, in the past week.
Woodrow...
It's bad...
But try to think what these boys are dying for.
112,000 dead.
[Knock on door]
Come in.
Governor...
Yes, tumulty?
Governor, here's a message that just came from the Swiss military.
"The German government
"requests the president of the United States to take steps for the restoration of peace."
Woodrow.
Mr. president.
"The basis to be the program laid down by the president in his 14 points."
Thank God.
[When Johnny comes marching home again plays]
[Train whistle blows]
[Playing classical music]
So you're going to Paris to write the peace?
And to buy my wife a new bonnet.
Is that a smart thing to do?
To buy me a new bonnet?
I don't know how smart it is, but I consider it most essential.
Mr. president,
I was wondering...
It's only a thought...
No, thank you...
If your influence wouldn't be greater if you stayed here and served as a sounding board...
Thank you very much...
And if mistakes were made, you could repudiate them.
I hope no mistakes will be made.
Lettuce sandwich.
I'll get you another.
Don't bother.
Who'll go with you?
Lansing and house.
I meant someone from the senate.
Remember, they'll have to approve any treaty.
Whom have you in mind?
Senator lodge is chairman of the foreign relations committee...
And a very practical man.
Have one of these,
Professor.
Thank you, Edith.
Ah, one with meat in it.
That's the trouble.
Too many treaties have been written by practical men.
If I take anyone from the other party, it'll be someone like Henry white.
He's served in our Paris embassy, he knows Europe...
May I point out,
Mr. president, that this is the heyday of nationalism among nations.
In Paris you'll meet the ablest politicians in the world...
Practical men...
Many of whom will be concerned not so much with peace as with national boundaries, indemnities, new balances of power.
Many of our own people are going to share their views.
It might be wise to have a practical man along to cope with such people.
Mac, I agree with you as to the situation.
I disagree with you as to the solution.
In a world full of practical men, more practical men would hinder rather than help.
Our great hope lies not in me or in any other individual, but in the power of right.
People all over the world...
The common people...
Have set their hearts and minds against selfish nationalism.
They've paid with their blood and treasure.
I must go...
Not alone, as president of the United States, but as the spokesman for these peoples of whatever nationality.
Our own people expect me to go.
To do anything less would be unthinkable.
Well, I suppose if your mind is made up, there's nothing we can do about it.
Still, if it were up to me,
I'd take lodge, put him right out in front, make him help carry the load.
I'd keep my eye on the little...
Oh, excuse me,
Edith...
On that little goatee of his.
Thank you, senator.
[Chuckling]
They tell me in Italy they're even burning candles in front of his picture.
Kaiser woodrow.
Or is it
Saint woodrow now?
He's having a field day, but wait till that old tiger clemenceau gets through with him.
He'll be lucky to keep his shirt.
It's America's shirt I'm worried about.
This'll put a firecracker under him.
Maybe now he'll realize there's such a thing as the senate and the constitution.
All this business about remaking the map of Europe, giving away this, giving away that, talking about America not having any material interest in this war...
What about the money we lent them?
I don't think we need to worry, gentlemen.
We now have the names of 37 members of the
United States senate affixed to this document.
Senator lodge, you haven't expressed yourself.
Are you still with us?
My views on this subject are well known, gentlemen.
Nothing that has happened in Europe or elsewhere has caused me to change them.
You'll introduce the resolution yourself?
I should consider it an honor, sir.
Thank you, senator.
Mr. president, France can accept no treaty that does not include the saone basin and all territory west of the rhine!
But France has no right to that land.
It belongs to the people who live on it.
They can go where they please.
My government demands the land and its resources!
So do our people!
That's impossible.
When the Germans surrendered, it was on condition that we protect their rights.
That's written in the armistice.
You yourself signed it.
The Germans forfeited their rights in this war.
They are murderers!
Monsieur clemenceau...
I will never be a party to such an agreement.
It violates everything we said we were fighting for.
To take part of Germany and cede it to France is nothing short of theft.
You live in America,
Mr. Wilson, with an ocean on either side.
You can afford to be lenient with your enemies.
If you won't abide by the armistice,
I might as well go home.
If such a position to our just claims is continued,
I might as well resign!
You're breaking your word!
You are pro-German!
Gentlemen, gentlemen...
Let us consider these matters calmly.
We all believe in the self-determination clause of the 14 points.
It is not right to do wrong, even to make peace.
Besides, the covenant of the league of nations is sufficient guarantee of France's safety.
Under its provisions, there is not the slightest shadow of a doubt but that the United States and Great Britain will instantly rise to the defense of France should Germany ever again become hostile.
That's all very well,
Mr. president, when you speak of what America will not do, but are you prepared to guarantee what America will do?
I am.
Are you aware that a block of 37 senators have signed a resolution stating that the league as you propose it is not acceptable to the American people?
I am perfectly aware of that document, monsieur.
However, I should like to remind you that these men do not compose the entire senate, nor do they reflect the opinion of the American people, regardless of party.
As a matter of fact, some of the leading members of the republican party, including former president
William Howard taft and
Charles Evans Hughes, have expressed approval of the league...
And I will also give you my word for this, too, monsieur...
If these 37 men, who represent no opinion but their own, dare try to block, to thwart, to betray the first honest attempt of the world to achieve a permanent peace, the American people will rise in their anger and smash them as they would an alien enemy landing on their shores.
Mr. president,
I bow to you.
Shall we resume our discussion?
Now.
I've asked you here in the hope that we might come to some understanding about the league of nations.
I don't mean to be facetious,
Mr. president, but whose understanding...
Yours or ours?
One we can mutually uphold.
In view of our stated positions,
I wonder if that isn't expecting a great deal.
Senator, I'm sure we all have one purpose in common...
To serve the best interests of the American people.
Apparently, we have very different ideas as to what constitutes their best interests.
In that case, shouldn't we at least try to reconcile our differences?
The treaty would have been approved weeks ago if it weren't attached to your league.
Not my league, senator.
As a matter of fact,
I'd be more inclined to call it your league, for I seem to recall that in 1916, you yourself advanced the thought that the nations would have to unite for peace and that an international police force would enforce it.
The fact that a man has changed his mind does not bear on the real merits of any question, and even if he happens to be a convert, some good work has been done by converts from the days of Saint Paul to the present.
Besides, even in my wildest dreams,
I never contemplated placing American arms and economic sanctions every time some ambitious ruler coveted the lands and resources of another.
We should constantly be involved in broils and quarrels that are none of our business.
Yet let me remind you that in every discussion of peace during the war, we promised...
I beg your pardon.
You promised.
This government promised...
That...
Some way would be found to avoid such catastrophes as we have just been through.
Other nations have accepted the principles of the league.
It is inconceivable that we who advanced it should go back on our word.
If that is your unalterable view,
I'm afraid we shall not get very far.
Just a moment, senator.
Perhaps we've made mistakes...
All of us...
But regardless of the treaty or what you individually may think of it...
Or of those who wrote it, let me remind you that the league is irrevocably attached to it...
And the league...
Is the only hope...
The world has to avoid wars in the future.
Unless you can advance a better idea...
I beg of you to consider that and to help save that hope.
I, too, have my ideals,
Mr. president, and one of them is peace.
But a realistic peace that we can surely maintain, one which will not siphon off the power and prestige and resources of the United States.
If you had wanted my views on this matter, you could very easily have obtained them before you went to Paris, before you made concessions to the statesmen of Europe, before you burned all your Bridges behind you.
This is not the age of miracles,
Mr. president...
Nor of miracle workers.
America has but two choices, gentlemen...
It must accept a league of nations or live with a gun in its hand.
It's for the people to decide.
Thank you for coming.
Good day.
Good day, sir.
Mr. president.
Tumulty, you may start making arrangements at once for our trip.
Governor, your health...
I'll have no more haggling with that man.
I'll stump the country and let the people know exactly what's at stake.
But, governor, you know what Dr. Grayson said.
You can't afford to take the risk.
I promised the young men of this country that we were fighting this war to end wars.
It's up to me to see that we meant what we said.
Woodrow...
For my sake, why don't you do as they ask?
Accept the senate reservations and get this awful quarrel settled.
Don't you desert me, too, Edith.
I... I couldn't stand that.
My dear, I'm only thinking of you, of your health.
I have no right to accept any changes, and even if I did, they'd come back tomorrow with 46 more.
It's just a scheme to kill the league entirely.
Forgive me.
I should have known.
Whatever mistakes we've made about disarmament, boundaries, reparations, war colonies, the league will be in a position to arbitrate and rectify.
[Train whistle blows]
The league is the vital and compelling part of the treaty.
But there can be no united action, no league of nations in the true sense, without America's participation.
The isolation of the United States is at an end!
Mr. president, you'll have to give up this trip and return to
Washington at once.
That's impossible.
It's not only possible, it's imperative.
But I can't stop now.
People are beginning to understand.
If I desert them now, they'll be confused and misled.
40 speeches in 17 states in 22 days.
No one could stand it.
I'm scheduled to speak here in pueblo.
People are waiting for me.
There are several points that still have to be explained.
But you could speak here another time.
I wouldn't ask you to stop if I thought there was the slightest chance you'd be able to go on, but you'll kill yourself.
I must go on.
I'm all right.
[Crowd cheering]
People of pueblo...
My fellow citizens.
I feel like asking the secretary of war to get the boys who went across the water to fight together on some field where I could go and see them...
And I would stand up before them and say,
"boys, I told you before you went across the seas
"that this was a war against wars, and I did my best to fulfill that promise..."
[Train whistle blows]
"But I am obliged to come to you
"with mortification and shame and say I have been unable to fulfill that promise."
"You are betrayed."
"You fought for something that you did not get...
"And the glory of the armies
"and the navies of the United States
"is gone like a dream in the night,
"and there ensues upon it,
"in the suitable darkness of the night...
"The nightmare of dread, which lay upon the nations before this war came."
"And there will come some time,
"in the vengeful
Providence of God,
"another struggle...
"In which not a few hundred thousand
"fine young men from America will have to die...
"But as many millions as are necessary
"to accomplish the final freedom of the peoples of the world."
I will...
Thank you for coming.
[Wilson]
I am so tired.
Mr. tumulty, will you please tell the newspapermen we're returning to Washington immediately?
Yes.
No.
[Train whistle blows]
His whole left side is paralyzed, but his mind is perfectly clear and untouched.
Will he recover?
He'll improve with time, but for the present, he needs rest and quiet, release from every disturbing problem.
But how is that possible?
Everything that comes to the president is a problem.
Wouldn't it be better if he'd resign and let Mr. Marshall succeed him?
No, no, no, Edith.
He's staked his life on getting the league ratified.
If he resigns now, this incentive to recovery will be gone.
Besides, his resignation would have a very bad effect on the country.
For that matter, on the whole world.
Our thought is that you have everything of an official nature come to you.
You can weigh the importance of each matter, and, in consultation with the heads of the various departments, decide what he must see and what can be left to others.
In this way, Edith, you can be of great service to him.
No.
I can't do it.
It's too great a responsibility.
Even though his life may depend upon it?
In that case, there's only one answer.
I'll try.
Here.
Yes, ma'am.
Well, Mrs. president...
Woodrow!
What's on tap for today?
Don't you dare to call me that.
You know very well
I never even made one decision without your knowledge and consent.
I know it, and you know it, but do our enemies know it?
I'm not concerned with what our enemies know.
You should listen to them, my dear.
You'd learn a great deal.
Such as what, cousin woodrow?
Well, during the war, for instance,
I never would have dreamed that Edith was a German spy if I hadn't kept my ears open.
Nor, I suppose, did you bargain with wall street to bring on the war in the first place.
For that matter,
I never would have suspected that I was insane if the senate hadn't sent the honorable
Albert fall to look me over.
Oh, that man.
I don't see how you take it so calmly.
I'd scratch their eyes out.
Woodrow handled senator fall beautifully.
As he was leaving, that gentleman said,
"Mr. president, the senate is praying for you."
And woodrow, without batting an eye, asked, "which way, senator?"
I'm afraid
I'm much more concerned with what my grandchildren and their generation think of me than I am with what the present lords of the earth have to say.
No memoranda today?
They've passed the volstead act over your veto.
Well, now we'll have prohibition,
I trust.
Well, tumulty.
Governor, the democrats have nominated
James Cox of Ohio.
Cox on one side,
Harding on the other.
Cox for the league,
Harding against it.
Well, the lines are drawn.
It's clearly up to the people to decide.
[Piano playing]
Governor?
Yes, tumulty?
[Piano stops]
Governor, it appears that senator Harding has won an overwhelming victory.
Mm-hmm.
Senator Harding has issued a statement to the American people declaring that the league of nations is now a closed incident.
Thank you, tumulty.
Yes, sir.
Well, Edith?
Yes, woodrow?
If these good people will excuse us.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Is that everything?
That's all, dear.
Thank you, Mrs. Wilson,
Mr. president.
Thank you.
I'm sorry I can't stay for the inauguration ceremonies, but Mr. Harding and Mr. coolidge have been kind enough to excuse me.
I told them it was bad enough for the senate to throw me down without my stumbling up the steps on my own account.
Mr. president, I...
Eight years.
Goodbye,
Marshall.
Goodbye,
Mr. president.
Goodbye,
Mr. Marshall.
Mrs. Wilson.
Good luck, sir.
It was a pleasure serving under you.
Thank you.
Mr. president, I...
Daniels, we've taken a house in "s" street.
I hope to see you there often.
Yes, indeed.
Thank you.
God bless you.
Goodbye,
Mr. president.
Goodbye, Alexander.
Goodbye.
It's a great honor to have been in your cabinet.
Houston, thank you for your very able support.
Goodbye,
Mr. president.
Goodbye, Wilson.
Mr. president, now that the United States has rejected the league, can we ever hope for peace or real understanding between nations?
Yes.
I'm not one of those who has the slightest anxiety about the eventual triumph of the things
I've stood for.
The fight's just begun.
You and I may never live to see it finished, but that doesn't matter.
The ideals of the league are not dead just because a few obstructive men now in the saddle say they are.
The dream of a world united against the awful wastes of war is too deeply embedded in the hearts of men everywhere.
Goodbye,
Mr. president.
Goodbye, Mr. Payne.
And I'll even make this concession to Providence it may come about in a better way than we proposed.
Goodbye,
Mr. president.

Sally, Johnny didn't mean no harm.
Remus: He was jes' trying to be like
Brer Rabbit. I tol' him a tale 'bout de
Remus: tar baby an' he just got a li'I bit too bodacious, and outreached hisse'f, dat's all.
Sally: Uncle Remus, i'm trying my best to bring up
Johnny to be obedient and truthful. But you and your
Sally: stories are making that very difficult. I think maybe it would be better if he didn't hear any more for awhile.
Remus: Well, Miss Sally, de stories ain't done no...
Sally: They only confuse him. Now I know you mean well, Uncle Remus, but Johnny's too young.
Remus: Miss Sally...
Sally: I'll have to ask you not to tell him any more.
Remus: Yassum, Miss Sally...
Sally: But what else could I have done, mama? I can't just overlook it, he has to learn to mind.
Doshy: That's very true, but without
Uncle Remus and his stories,
Doshy: the child will be utterly desolate.
He needs something to hold on to.
Sally: Well, he has his mother... and his grandmother.
Doshy: We're not enough, sally. The boy must have friends. And if it's not Uncle Remus, or the Favers
Doshy: children, then it must be someone else... someone of his own age. That's just good common sense.
Tempy: What you trackin' through here for anyway?
Ain't I done tol' you 'bout messin' 'roun' my kitchen?
Sally: Johnny!
Johnny: Yes, mama.
Sally: Do you know what next tuesday is?

Sally: And a birthday party. Would you like that?
Johnny: A party? Sure!
Sally: With lots of nice little boys and girls.
Johnny: Can i ask Ginny?
Sally: Well, there'll be so many other children, dear...
Doshy: That one more won't make any difference.
Johnny: Gee! Thanks! Will daddy come?
Sally: Well, dear... uh... I'll write and ask him.
Johnny: Oh boy.
Johnny: Teenchy! Here Teenchy!
Johnny: Teenchy! Here Teenchy!
Teenchy! Where are you?
Johnny: Uncle Remus? A present for Teenchy! Where's Teenchy?
Remus: He's gone.
Johnny: Gone? Then we gotta find him. Sump'n might happen to him... if he runs around loose.
Remus: He ain't runnin' 'roun' loose.
Johnny: Then, where is he?
Remus: He's back at de Favers. Dat's what he b'longs an' you knows it.
Johnny: But teenchy's my dog. He's mine.
Johnny: Ginny gave him to me, and you said...
Remus: Nemmine what I said! Yo' maw tol' you to take dat dawg back whar he

Johnny: You don't even care! Teenchy's gone... and you don't care at all.
Remus: Don't make no difference whether I does or whether I
Remus: don't. I'm jes a wo' out ol' man what ain't no good to nobody.
Johnny: But uncle remus, you're... the best friend i have.
Remus: Mebbe so, but i'm dat pestered I don't know whether i'm end-upperds or
Remus: end-downerds. But I does know dis...
I ain't goin' ter be tellin' you no mo' stories.
Children: Chick-a-ma, chick-a-ma, craney crow! I went to the well to wash
Childern: my toe! When I got there, the well was bare! What time is it, old witch!
Ginny: Hurry, maw, hurry!

The party'll be over.
Maw Favers: If you don't quit bobbin' up and down I'll never get this collar on.
Ginny: I'm just doin' like you told me.
Maw Favers: Well, don't forgit what you says when you does it.
Ginny: Pleased to meetcha!
Maw Favers: That's the girl. Now you looks pretty enough to go anywheres.
Johnny: Ginny! Come on... we're late.
Maw Favers: Ginny! Don't forgit your manners.
Ginny: Pleased to meetcha!
Joe: Pleased to meetcha!

Saturday, September 25th:
Another heavenly day.
Yes.
It's always a heavenly day.
Every day is perfect.
Nothing but happiness.
Yes, happiness, happiness, happiness.
I have everything that any man or angel could desire.
Beautiful memories of the past.
Pictures, toys...
Toys.
Children play with the dreams of tomorrow...
...and old men play with the memories of yesterday.
Broadway.
Broadway I can see it again.
The Broadway of 1907.
The Broadway that was waiting for me.
An innocent world believing in a golden future.
Full of peace and laughter
and beautiful girls.
And here's the theater
where my first Follies opened.
As I look at that theater now,
it's all mine forever.
No taxes, no bills,
and no competitors.
There they are. My first public.
The high and mighty,
and the hoi polloi.
And here, they're all mine.
Eternal toys that never grow older.
Look at Mrs. Astor in her beautiful
carriage with her famous horse.
Much more famous
that night than Ziegfeld.
And didn't the horse know it.
And Diamond Jim Brady
with no horse...
... but what a filly inside the car.
There they are, an old New York
first-night audience...
... the judge and the jury.
"What have you got, Mr. Ziegfeld?
Show us your magic, if you dare.
Make us dream, if you can.
What have you got, Mr. Ziegfeld?"
Anna Held Hourglass Girls.
Thank you, Mrs. Astor.
I can pretend all my great stars
never grew older...
... are still dancing and singing
as they did years ago.
Marilyn Miller.
Fanny Brice.
Look at me, oh, look at me
Ho, I'm an Indian
Aha, I'm an Indian
Will Rogers.
Well...
What will I talk about?
I ain't got anything funny to say.
- All I know is what I read in the paper.
- Eddie Cantor.
If you knew Susie
Like I know Susie
Oh, oh, oh, what a girl
There's none so classy
As this fair lassie
Oh, oh, holy Moses
What a chassis
We went riding
She didn't balk
Back from Yonkers
I'm the one who had to walk
If you knew Susie
Like I know Susie
Oh, oh, what a girl
I can hear the applause as if
it hadn't disappeared into the past.
The New York night
still burns for me...
... with the names
I have branded into its sky.
Great shows that were part
of the dreams of America.
How many millions of people today
remember their courtships...
... their honeymoons,
their anniversaries...
... their happiest moments
in terms of a Ziegfeld show?
The world would never forget
the Ziegfeld Follies.
Those were the good old days.
And yet, I wonder.
Are those days really over?
Just because I moved up here did the Follies have to die too?
Couldn't there be a new Follies?
No, no, I suppose not.
After all, how could there be a Ziegfeld Follies without Ziegfeld?
What I would give to be able to put on one more Follies.
Yes.
So many personalities down there to choose from.
Great personalities from my day, and great ones that have come up since.
How would I open?
Let's see.
I'd like a crayon and paper.
Thank you.
I think I'd open with a pink number.
Yes, a beautiful pink number...
...with a beautiful pink and white, blue-eyed girl.
Yes. And maybe to introduce the whole thing...
Well, who would be better than my old friend Fred Astaire?
A great star, Freddie.
I'd be taking no chances with him.
And I know Freddie would say something very nice about me.
What can I say about Ziegfeld?
Well, I can only tell you that as long as there's a dance...
...a song, a musical show and it's good...
...somewhere around or in it is Ziegfeld.
He never cared so much about villains, plots, stories.
The Follies never had a story.
The Ziegfeld Follies was itself a story of an era.
If it was gay, bright, beautiful...
...that's how Ziggy wanted it.
And, oh, I almost forgot:
The girls.
Ziggy was a specialist at glorifying girls.
That's one of the most important things about the Follies, you know.
So...
Here's to the beautiful ladies
Here's to those wonderful girls
Adeles and Mollys
Lucilles and Pollys
You'll find them all
In the Ziegfeld Follies
Here's to the silks and the satins
Here's to the diamonds and pearls
This is the mixture
To start the picture
So bring on the beautiful girls
Here's to the silks and the satins
Here's to the diamonds and pearls
A sweet endeavor
A joy forever
So bring on the beautiful girls
Here's to the beautiful ladies
Here's to those wonderful girls
Adeles and Mollys
Lucilles and Pollys
You'll find them all
In the Ziegfeld Follies
Here's to the silks and the satins
Here's to the diamonds and pearls
A joy forever
A sweet endeavor
To bring on the beautiful girls
This is the mixture
To start the picture
So bring on the beautiful girls
All this yap-yap-yap
About glorifying dames
Leaves me like a cold potato
I'd much rather be
With a handsome he
Like Van Johnson
Who's a real tomato
For a date with Fred MacMurray
You can bet your life I'd hurry
And a guy like Mischa Auer
Has me completely in his power
In fact most any man I've seen
Is the only man for me
Bring on those wonderful men
Bring me an elegant guy
A soldier or sailor
A Gable or Taylor
A short or a tall one
I just wanna call one
My own, private wonderful he
Bring what you can to me
Bring me a guy to pin up
Bring me a prince on a horse
A dark or a light one
I just want to sight one
Who'll call me his missis
And give with the kisses
I'm afraid I've a terrible yen
For those wonderful M-E-N
Amor, Amor
There must be someone for me
But what's he waiting for?
No hope, no soap
If he don't appear
I fear I'm at the end of my rope
Oh, bring on a male who ain't frail
Bring on a man from a cave
Someone to relax with
And pay income tax with
And though he's from hunger
I'm not getting younger
And I'd like to get on with my plan
To glorify the American man
I know the men are few
But what's a gal to do?
I'll get a man before I'm through
Hey, you in the third row:
Bring on those wonderful men

Well, we'll see about that.
Come on with me.
- Pay him the 2 dollars.
- I'll break you for this, officer.
Pay him the 2 dollars.
The court finds the defendant guilty of expectorating in the subway...
...and hereby fines the defendant two dollars, or 30 days in jail.
- All right. Pay him the 2 dollars.
- Nothing doing.
We'll appeal.
- Oh, pay the 2 dollars.
- No.
You're a businessman and you can't afford...
...to have a black mark against you.
- We'll take it to a higher court.
- Take him away.
Oh, please. Pay the 2 dollars.
Don't worry. I'll have you out of here in 20 minutes.
How long have you been in here?
I'll bet you've got the same lawyer I've got.
Hello, Victor, how are you?
Where have you been?
I've been waiting here 12 days for you to get back in 20 minutes.
Oh, now, Victor, don't be so impatient.
I haven't much time.
I am in a bit of a hurry.
But I couldn't help but drop by, and give you the good news.
Yes, the court has granted our motion for an appeal.
Look, "Whereas my client,
Victor Moore...
...here and after known as the defendant...
...is being sued for committing a public nuisance"...
Never mind that stuff.
Just pay them the 2 dollars.
I will not.
I never lost a case in my life.
Say, what are you trying to do?
Spoil my record?
No. All I'm trying to do is get out of jail.
Won't you please pay them the 2 dollars?
Nothing doing.
You're going to appeal.
And by the way,
I want you to know...
...that I kept the accounts absolutely straight.
- What do you mean, "accounts"?
- It takes money to file an appeal.
- Well, pay the 2 dollars.
- No, no. It's too late.
I've already filed my briefs.
Now here are the accounts.
Never mind.
How much did you spend?
Well, three stenographers for 10 days at 5 dollars a day.
A hundred and fifty dollars.
That's for preparing the briefs.
Now, $ 10 a day for taking them to lunch.
What do you mean by taking stenographers...
...out to lunch on my money?
- Don't tell me how to live my life.
Now then, $ 100 a day for three assistants.
- Five thousand to Walter Wilson.
- For what?
- For an opinion.
- What did Wilson say?
He said, "Pay them the 2 dollars."
Five thousand dollars to Barker,
Barker, Barker and Barker.
- What did Barker, Barker, Barker and...?
- And Barker?
- Barker. What did they say?
- "Pay them the $2."
Five thousand to Jerry Geisler for an opinion.
- What did he say?
- He said, "Pay them the $2."
Seems to be quite a difference of opinion.
Oh, wait. I'm not through yet.
Now, there's $250 to my nephew for an opinion.
A hundred and fifty to my niece for an opinion.
And $ 75 for my wife's opinion.
What are you bringing them in for?
They're not lawyers.
Well, everybody's entitled to their opinion.
Now comes my opinion: $3000.
Oh, but we're gonna win this case.
We got an ace in the hole.
- We got four witnesses.
- What? We ain't got no witnesses.
Oh, yes, we have.
Two are coming from Chicago, and two from Detroit.
And that makes the total expense to date...
For goodness sake, will you pay the 2 dollars.
It is the opinion of this court...
...that the decision of the lower court be reversed.
- Reversed. Didn't I tell you?
- Is that good?
Silence.
As a result of the defendant's behavior in the subway...
...a deadly germ was spread...
...which caused the death of two citizens.
We therefore find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree.
And the defendant is hereby sentenced...
...to the punishment of death.
Your Honor, we appeal.
Pay them the 2 dollars.
Give them each 2 dollars.
Victor, you have only a few hours left to live.
Nonsense.
I've got this case all sewed up.
You've got nothing to worry about.
I had the governor on the phone all afternoon...
...and the pardon will be here any minute.
What would you like for dinner, Victor?
This will be your last meal.
You can order anything you want.
- I can have anything?
- Anything.
- You take the order?
- Yes, sir.
Well, I have an order of toast...
...dry toast.
Not the thin Melba toast...
...thicker.
And a cup of cocoa...
...and some stewed prunes and cream.
No. Better leave out the cream.
That's fattening.
Oh, come on, Victor, cheer up.
Have a cigar.
Didn't I tell you the governor would come through with a pardon?
Arnold never lost a case.
It's a good thing you had me as a lawyer...
...or you would have been a dead pigeon, sure.
You're a lucky man.
Yeah. I'm a lucky man.
You ruined my business.
You wrecked my health.
You spend all my money.
My wife left me because I'm an ex-convict.
My children are disgraced.
I'm a ruined man, and all because of you.
You're a lawyer.
- You're under arrest.
- What, again? Hand it to him.
- Don't worry, they can't do this.
- Please pay him the 2 dollars.
- I'll have you out in 20 minutes.
- I wanted to pay them.
Don't do a thing, Victor, until you hear from me.
Maybe it was the music
Or the glamorous sky of blue
Maybe it was the mood I was in
Or maybe it was really you
Really you
This heart of mine
Was doing very well
The world was fine
As far as I could tell
And then quite suddenly I saw you
And I dreamed of gay amours
At dawn I'll wake up singing
Sentimental overtures
This heart of mine
Is gaily dancing now
I taste the wine
Of real romancing now
Somehow this crazy world
Has taken on
A wonderful design
As long as life endures
It's yours, this heart of mine
This heart of mine
Was doing very well
The world was fine
As far as I could tell
And then quite suddenly I met you
And I dreamed of gay amours
At dawn I woke up singing
Sentimental overtures
This heart of mine
Is gaily dancing now
I taste the wine
Of real romancing now
Somehow this crazy world
Has taken on a wonderful design
As long as life endures
It's yours, this heart of mine
Somehow this crazy world
Has taken on
A wonderful design
As long as life endures
It's yours
This heart of mine
Hello, operator?
I just dialed a number.
What? No outgoing calls?
I mailed you a check yesterday.
You'll positively receive it tomorrow.
You'll leave the phone connected?
Thank you.
Please get me that number.
Hello. Is this the butcher?
This is Mrs. Ederman.
I got to have 2 pound lamb chops right away for dinner.
No meat? I mailed you a check yesterday.
You'll positively receive it tomorrow.
I'll get the lamb chops tomorrow.
Thank you.
I mailed you...
Oh, it's the door.
Come in.
- Mrs. Ederman?
- Yeah.
- A cablegram.
- A cablegram?
- Yeah, from... From Ireland.
- Ireland? Let me see.
- Who do I know in Ireland?
- I think you won the sweepstakes.
"Congratulations, your ticket number 44678...
...has been drawn in the Irish Sweepstakes."
Here. I got no change.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
I... I won. I won.
Well, somebody, I won.
Oi, Monty, Monty.
Hello. I won.
Oi, Ireland, what a marvelous city.
Is that you, Monty?
- Norma? Is dinner re...?
- Monty. I love you. Monty, I love you.
What's the matter?
You been untrue to me?
Yes. No. I mean,
I just got a cable from Ireland.
- Monty, have I got a surprise for you.
- What is it?
The ticket you bought on the sweepstakes?
- Yes.
- Well, it won.
We won a steak?
- We... We won the sweepstakes?
- Yeah.
A glass of water, please.
What do you mean, water?
Champagne. We're rich.
All our troubles are over.
Dance. Do something.
- Oi, Monty.
- Hurrah. We're rich.
We're rich. We got...
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Monty, don't go crazy yet.
Wait till we get the money.
I haven't gone crazy.
Something terrible has happened.
What could be terrible when we won the sweepstakes?
I met the landlord in the hall and had to pay him the month's rent, $45.
So? We'll buy the house.
But you don't understand,
I only had $42.50.
To make up the extra two dollars and a half, I gave the landlord the ticket.
So what?
- What did you say?
- I gave the landlord the ticket.
- Monty, dear, you should drop dead.
- I'll jump out the window.
Who stops you?
If he knows the ticket won, he won't give it back.
But if he don't know, we'll get it. Quick.
- He's out in the hall.
- Get him.
- Get him.
- Mr. Martin.
Mr. Martin. Mr. Martin.
Why, come in, Mr. Martin.
Funny, my wife was just talking about you.
- Hello, Mrs. Ederman.
- Hello, Mr. Martin. Sit down.
- Thanks.
- You look good.
You look absolutely wonderful.
Make yourself at home.
Here. Take an apple.
- Thank you.
- You know, Mr. Martin...
...my wife is so superstitious about that sweepstake ticket.
- Yeah.
- If you let me have it back...
...l'll give you the 2.50 tomorrow.
If that's why you called me in, I'm going.
I've got the ticket here in my wallet and that's where it's gonna stay.
- No, no. Sit down.
- You just arrived. Yes.
You know, you never come around to see us...
...and we're always so glad to see you.
Why don't you make yourself comfortable?
- Go on. Take off your coat.
- All right.
Sure, take it off.
It's hot in here, you know.
Oh, it's so wrinkled.
I could press it for you.
Oh, thank you.
The pants is wrinkled too.
I could press the whole suit in a jiffy.
- No, never mind.
- Sure. Take off your pants.
Never mind the pants.
If it'll make you feel at home,
I'll take off mine.
No, just press the coat.
Do you know that I have a feeling that this ticket's gonna win?
Pardon me. I don't feel so good.
Come in.
Here, Mr. Martin. Sit down again.
- Have an apple.
- Oh, thanks.
Cablegram, Mrs. Ederman.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Beat it.
- Why did he offer you congratulations?
- A relative died.
- Oh, that's too bad.
- Yeah, it's terrible, ain't it?
- Now I'm gonna press your coat.
- Thank you.
Monty. Monty.
A London syndicate is offering us
$25,000 for the ticket.
And we ain't got the ticket.
Talk. Talk.
- Talk, talk. Talk, talk.
- Well, I...
Don't say a word.
Don't say a word.
The trouble with you, you get too excited.
Don't get excited.
Don't get excited.
Don't get excited.
Hold yourself together.
Don't go to pieces.
Hold yourself together.
- You all right?
- Fine.
What will we do?
What will we do?
Let's tell him the truth.
Maybe he'll give us half the money.
Poison, he'll give us.
That's what's the trouble with you.
You get excited.
You go to pieces.
I got an idea.
If we get excited, he'll get suspicious.
So we'll go in there, and we'll act very nonchalantly.
- You know, namby-pamby.
- Pamby-namby?
See, like nothing happened.
Wait, where's a cigarette?
Here. Here. Put a cigarette in there.
Now laugh.
Laugh like you told me a funny story.
Like nothing happened. Laugh.
Oh, Monty.
That was the funniest story.
Tell it to him.
Mr. Martin, my wife is so in love with that sweepstake ticket.
Not that it means anything, just a whim.
Mr. Martin, if that ticket did win, what would you do?
I'd hop on a boat, go over to Ireland and collect the money.
Monty. Monty.
Monty, it didn't work.
We was too namby-pamby.
Now what will we do?
Honesty is the best policy.
Let's tell him the truth.
- There must be an easier way.
- George Washington told the truth.
Did he win a sweepstakes?
Besides, this man is holding back our property.
- Here. Take this vase.
- What for?
Just a light tap. Not hard.
Just a little tap on his head.
- Don't break the vase.
- Why should I hit him?
- Say he tried to kiss me.
- Who would believe it?
I can dream, can't I? Wait.
I know how to get the ticket.
I'll flirt with him.
If I only had a sweater.
I'll take this.
I'll get that ticket or my middle name ain't Violet.
I'll captivate him.
- Am I captivating?
- I never noticed it before.
Norma, I think you've got something there, but don't go too far.
No, just far enough to get the ticket.
What's the matter?
Did you hurt yourself?
No.
You know, Mr. Martin...
...I find life just too dull for words.
- Ain't you?
- What?
All my life. All my life...
...l've been languishing away in this terrible flat.
What's the matter? Is there something wrong with the plumbing?
No, it's not that. It's my husband.
He don't understand me.
Is that so?
Well, do you know, Mrs. Ederman...
...you're looking very attractive.
- You think so?
- Would you like to loll away the time?
- Yes.
Shall I turn on the radio?
And we'll dance?
- Yes.
- And we'll have a good time?
- Can you do the jitterbug?
- Well, I'll take a chance.
Spanish, Señor Martin.
You know, my grandfather was a Spaniard.
So that's what you're up to, huh?
The old Badger game.
You'll not get away with it.
I'll have you arrested.
Oh, please don't do that, Mr. Martin.
I might as well tell you the truth.
That ticket you've got won the sweepstakes...
...and they're offering
$25,000 for it.
- You mean this ticket won?
- It won.
You're right, Monty.
Honesty is the best policy.
Love can be a moment's madness
Love can be insane
Love can be a life
Of sadness and pain
Love can be a summer shower
Love can be the sun
Love can be two hearts
That flower as one
It can be fine and free
But it's true
It doesn't always happen to you
Love can be a dying amber
Love can be a flame
Love pledged in September
May be dead in December
You may not even remember
It came
Oh, love can be a joy forever
Or an empty name
Love is almost never ever the same
Oh, love can be a cup of sorrow
Love can be a lie
Love can make you wake tomorrow
And sigh
Love can be a snow-capped mountain
Love can be the truth
Love can be an endless
Fountain of youth
It can be ecstasy
But that kind
Is not so very easy to find
Oh, love can be a tinkling cymbal
Love can be a dirge
Love may seem amusing
A spark constantly fusing
But it may end up by losing
Its urge
Oh, love can be a sweet endeavor
Or a dirty shame
Love is almost never ever
The same
This is the Clumsy

In Limehouse
Where Orientals love to play
In Limehouse
Where you can hear those blues all day
And they seem all around
Like a long, long sigh
Queer sob sigh
"Oh, honey lamb," they seem to cry
Such a lovely sight
And everything was simply grand
That is until last night
He pinched me
He pinched me
He wouldn't let me be
I think he did it just to make...
Last night down our alley came a toff
Nice old geezer with a nasty cough
Sees my missis, takes the lady off
In a very gentlemanly way
"Ma'am," says he,
"I have some news to tell
Your rich uncle Tom of Camberwell
Has popped off
And really now it ain't a sell
Left to you his little donkey shay"
"Wot cher,"
All the neighbors say
"Who you going to meet, Bill?
Think you own the street, Bill?"
Laugh, I thought I would've died
Knocked him in the Old Kent Road
Oh, Limehouse kid
Oh, oh, oh, Limehouse kid
Going the way
That the rest of them did
Poor broken blossom
And nobody's child
Haunting and taunting
You're just kind of wild, oh
Oh, Limehouse blues
I've the real Limehouse blues
Learned from the willow
Those sad China blues
Rings on your fingers
And tears for a crown
That is the story
Of old Chinatown
Rings on your fingers
And tears for a crown
That is the story
Of old Chinatown
We are here to interview a lady
Known to you because of her ability
As the glamorous amorous lady
They call...
She's expecting you, gentlemen.
Won't you come in?
Now we don't mean Greta
And we don't mean Bette-a
Or Loretta
or The Song of Bernadette- a
We mean the fabulous "dabulous" lady
They call...
The other gentlemen are here.
Please come in.
- She's news
- She's front-page stuff
- She's headlines
- She's tops
And in advance
The critics are all in accord
She's gonna win
The next Academy Award
All her fans will be delighted
Not to mention quite excited
At her personal appearance
Presently
She's "stupendious," "tremendious"
"Collosical," "terrifical"
She's got it
But definitely
The glamorous amorous lady
They call...
Fribbins, what is all this?
The gentlemen of the press, milady.
Darlings.
How utterly charming of you to have dropped in like this.
How delightfully informal of you to have dropped in like this.
I mean, how perfectly marvelous of you to have...
Well, you have dropped in, haven't you?
And I...
Well, gentlemen...
...you have caught me pitifully unprepared.
And now you may rise.
And now you may rise.
Come. Get up, get up, get up.
Let's get on with this.
There. Now, that's better, isn't it?
Gentlemen of the press.
Members of the fourth estate, what can I do for you?
Tell me, pray do.
Oh, glamorous lady
Oh, amorous lady
Oh, "hamorous" lady
Here's to you
And humbly we're here to
Quite mumbly we're here to
"Humdrumly" we're here
To interview you
We're here to pry
Into your private life
We're here to seek
Your every secret
We're here to scoop a scoop
Obviously
What is your next vehicle to be?
This is much too much.
A sort of a bit of a go and touch.
But confidentially, gentlemen, and this is off the record, of course.
Of course.
But about my next picture...
I'm faced with a curious problem.
Shall I always be dramatic?
Biographically emphatic?
Should I devote my life
To the legitimate art?
Or should I do what I'd adore so?
Do my acting with my torso
And give all the natives a start?
Must the roles I play be tragic?
Full of Oscar-winning magic?
Should I drain the cup of drama
To its dregs?
Or do you think it is permissible
To be, for once, quite kissable
And give them a peep of my legs?
I'd like to be a pinup girl
A cheesecake girl too
And what is Ginger Rogers
That I am not?
And what has Betty Grable got
That I haven't got?
Oh, the cinema must exhibit me
In roles that so inhibit me
I feel, well, I feel just like a soldier
Out of step
Yes.
But would the episode outlive me?
Would my public quite forgive me?
If I tried to show the world
I'm really hep?
Oh, but now, you darlings.
You adorable dear, dear boys.
I'm going to tell you all about my next picture.
What is my next picture?
No, don't tell me, don't tell me.
Excuse me, darling.
Madame Crematante.
Madame Crematante, gentlemen...
...will be a monumental biographical tribute...
...to a monumental biographical woman...
...who toiled, searched, starved...
...slaved, suffered...
...pioneered, so that the world...
...you and I...
...could reap the benefits of her magnificent discovery:
The safety pin.
The story starts in a dark, dank...
...dingy tenement in Amsterdam.
Holland, you know.
In the flat of a poor impoverished family...
...but of rather good antecedents.
Gretchen Crematante was a very brave and noble woman who...
...against the wishes of her father...
The baron, you know.
- Married this young inventor who didn't have a sou, penniless.
- And there they were in Amsterdam
- In Amsterdam?
Yes, there they were
In a dark and dingy tenement flat
With no food and no heat
And no money for to pay the rent
- But did they care?
- No, they don't care

She don't care
'Cause she seen the light
Just the other day
Since then she been trying
For to find a way
For to bring to the world a big invent
- And so she did
- And so she did
Madame Crematante did
She toiled and strived
And sweat and slaved
A- stretchin' her mind
And beginnin' to rave
But the price she paid
Was worth the pain
For on a cold and frosty morn
- Oh, no
- The safety pin was born
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Halle, lu, lu, lu, lu, jah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Halle, lu, lu, lu, lu, jah
Shout hallelujah and a big amen
For the lady with the safety pin
She really rocks about and gives you
What more do you want?
- Madame Crematante
- Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Scream and shout
Who cares what it's all about
Just as long as you're stompin'
And jivin' and gassin' and gabbin'
And jammin' and jumpin'
When you talk about the safety pin
Who's got the safety pin?
Slip me the safety pin
- No doubt about it
- No baby can do without
The safety pin
The safety pin
The safety pin
The safety pin
The safety pin
Madame Crematante
She's a lady who was heaven-sent
She's the lady with the big invent
- Safety pin
- Madame Crematante
She's the lady with the big invent
Madame Crematante
She's the lady with the big invent
Madame Crematante
She's the lady with the big invent
Madame Crematante the big invent
How are you?
- Say, you're Fred Astaire. Hello.
- That's right. Hello.
I'm sorry, I can't quite place you.
What line of business are you in?
Well, I dance.
Oh, at home for the folks, picnics and that kind of thing?
- No, in public.
- On street corners?
Oh, no. On the screen.
Motion pictures.
You do go to pictures that have dancing in them, don't you?
I try to see them all.
I go as often as I can.
Did you see a picture called Cover Girl?
Yes.
Well, who did all the dancing in that?
You're not Rita Hayworth?
No, I'm not, Ginger.
- Well, so long, Gene.
- See you around.
- I've got a little number to do.
- I've got a little number to do.
- You have?
- Well, sure.
- Here?
- Sure.
Say, why don't we just ad-lib a little something together then, huh?
- Whip it up here on the spot?
- Throw it away.
Like the one we've been rehearsing for two weeks.
A Babbitt met a bromide
On the avenue one day
And held a conversation
In their own peculiar way
They both were solid citizens
They both had been around
And as they spoke you clearly saw
Their feet were on the ground
- Hello
- How are you?
- How's the folks?
- What's new?
- I'm great
- That's good
- Knock wood
- Well, well
- That's life
- What do you know?
- How's the wife?
- Gotta run
- Oh, my
- Ta-ta
- Olive oil
- Goodbye
Ten years went quickly by
For both these "substiantial" men
And then it happened that one day
They chanced to meet again
That they had both developed
In 10 years there was no doubt
And so of course they had
An awful lot to talk about
- Hello
- How are you?
- How's the folks?
- What's new?
- I'm great
- That's good
- Knock wood
- Well, well
- That's life
- What do you know?
- How's the wife?
- Gotta run
- Oh, my
- Ta-ta
- Olive oil
- Goodbye
Before they met again
Some 20 years they had to wait
This time it happened up above
Inside Saint Peter's gate
A harp each one was carrying
And both were sprouting wings
And this what they said as
They were strumming on the strings
- Hello
- How are you?
- How's the folks?
- What's new?
- I'm great
- That's good
- Knock wood
- Well, well
- That's life
- What do you know?
- How's the wife?
- Gotta fly
- Oh, my
- Ta-ta
- Olive oil
- Goodbye
The gleam of a blue-white moonlight
Makes diamonds of the stars
In the sky
The gold of an autumn sunset
Colors a cloud passing by
The night says goodbye
To the morning
And a heart says hello to a heart
All of these wonderful things
Shall endure
They're works of art
There's beauty everywhere
That everyone can share
A lovely world can be unfurled
To those who see and care
We search for beauty gay
Through every livelong day
And then someone comes into view
And suddenly you find it's true
That love is beauty too
And then someone comes into view
And suddenly you find it's true
That love is beauty too
And then someone comes into view
And suddenly you find it's true
That love is beauty too

Where to, Mr. Churchill?
Some large, bright, gay place with hundreds of beautiful girls.
- Some large, bright, gay place.
- With hundreds of beautiful girls.
Yes, sirree.
Isn't that a coincidence, on the right there?
- Thank you, Jeeves. Thank you, Jives.
- Mr. Churchill, hold it, please.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Here we go.
- Evening, Mr. Churchill.
Good evening, Marcus.
Why, Mr. Churchill, you're quite a stranger.
Not to the people that know me.
Girls?
Good evening. Hello, fellows.
- Hi, hey.
- How are you?
- Why, Mr. Churchill.
- Thomas.
- We certainly have missed you.
- Well, thank you.
You couldn't have picked a better night.
- Really? Why?
- Tommy Dorsey's opening.
- Hiya, Tom.
- Hello, Dan.
I've always been considered
Quite a delicate child
Watched over by a governess
And nurse
To say I've led a sheltered life
Is putting it mild
I promise you it couldn't be much worse
Mother always called me
Her hothouse rose
And all the dates I had
Were with hothouse beaus
But now that I am old enough
To cast a few votes
I'm going out and sow a few oats
So
Treat me rough, muss my hair
Don't you dare to handle me with care
I'm no innocent child, baby
Keep on treating me wild
Treat me rough
Pinch my cheek
Kiss and hug and squeeze me
Till I'm weak
I've been pampered enough, baby
Keep on treating me rough
Treat me rough, muss my hair
Don't you dare to handle me with care
- I'm no innocent child
- No innocent child
Keep on treating me wild
Treat me rough
Pinch my cheek
Kiss and hug and squeeze me
Till I'm weak
- I've been pampered enough
- I've been pampered enough
Baby, keep on treating me rough
Can't get enough
Treat me rough
No one can
Don't you dare to handle me with care
I'm no innocent child, baby
Keep on treating me wild
Treat me rough
Pinch my cheek
Kiss and hug and squeeze me
Till I'm weak
I've been pampered enough, baby
Keep on treating me rough
When I was born
They found a silver spoon in my mouth
I had a barber just to curl my hair
If winter came
The mater carried me to the south
The point is that I had the best of care
Women and headwaiters fawned on me
Life was just a bore till it dawned on me
That if I'd ever want to be a man
Amongst men
I'd have to be manhandled now and then
So treat me rough
Muss my hair
Don't you dare to handle me with care
I'm no innocent child, baby
Keep on treating me wild
Treat me rough, pinch my cheeks
Kiss and hug and squeeze me
Until I'm weak
I've been pampered enough, baby
Keep on treating me rough
Danny Churchill.
Silly, isn't it, Dad?
- Son.
- Yes, sir?
You're living in a world of weekend whimsy...
...and growing up to be a rich man's son.
Surely you don't believe what's printed in the papers?
"Publisher's son is crowned king.
Danny Jr. "
"Publisher's son stops show. "
Why, it's incredible.
Dad, you know how reporters like to exaggerate.
Any mention of Danny Jr. Winning academic honors at Yale?
- No. Or even a spelling bee?
- No.
The next thing you know, you'll be sponsoring a beauty contest.
- It isn't really that bad.
- Now look, Danny.
None of this stuff is actually bad.
But if it keeps on, you'll get to be known as a character.
The first thing you know...
...why, you start living up to the write-ups and that is bad.
And we're not going to let that happen, are we?
You're right. I'm sorry, Dad.
I'll leave for New Haven today.
No, Danny, you're not going back to New Haven.
No, you're going to Cody.
Cody? What's that?
Cody College of Mines and Agriculture.
It's out West.
It has fresh air.
And it is not coeducational.
Dad, you can't be serious.
Why, a guy would go daffy out there.
Well, there's a bare possibility that it might make a man of you.
And another thing, just so it won't be a shock to you.
There hasn't been a woman out there since the Civil War.
Well, that doesn't make any...
"Codyville. Two thousand, eight hundred and fifty feet. "
Hey.
Hey!
- Where's the hotel in this town?
- Ain't none.
Well, where do people live?
There ain't none.
Well, could you tell me where Cody College is?
Down the road, about eight miles.
Well, are there any taxis in the town?
Oh, no, don't tell me. I know.
There ain't none.
- Well, good night.
- Good night.
"Cody College.
Eight miles. "
"Cody College.
Eight miles. "
"Cody College.
Eight miles. "
Hey.
Hey!
Having a little trouble?
Why don't you leave it out here for the buzzards?
Well... Well, I'll be.
Hello.
- I said, hello.
- That's what I thought you said.
Well, what do people out West say when somebody says hello to them?
Look, stranger, why don't you just go away?
Oh, that isn't very nice.
I've been lying under that jumping jack for a half an hour.
- I'm not in the mood for small talk.
- Oh, excuse me.
I just happened to be in the neighborhood...
...and I thought I'd drop by to tell you...
...that you're the best-looking automobile mechanic I've ever seen.
Traveling salesman?
- What are you laughing at?
- Nothing. I'm just happy.
- You're sure it isn't the sun.
- No, no, it's something about my father.
He sent me out West to get away...
To get away from the girls.
And I find you right out here in the middle of the desert.
I think it's very funny.
- You do?
- Yeah.
Would you go ahead and have your own private little joke.
I've got things to do.
What are you doing down there?
Grinding coffee.
May I?
Won't talk, eh?
Well, it looks like Hattie here isn't gonna be very sociable.
Well, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
There's nothing left for you to do but to sit here...
...and give me the story of your life.
If I'm not at school in 10 minutes
I'm gonna miss the mail train.
You mean Cody?
You don't mean to tell me that you're a student there?
No, I carry the mail.
Government's making a big mistake.
They ought to put your picture on the postage stamps.
Well, I can't waste any more time here.
Wait a minute, would you?
Let me try it once more, please?
- Well, that's it.
- Wait a minute. Where are you going?
Out West, when we're in trouble, we walk.
It's the same in the East.
I'll go with you.
My name is Danny Churchill.
I'm from New York.
Free, white and lonesome.
- Danny... Did you say Churchill?
- Churchill Jr., yeah.
- The playboy?
- Well, I...
- What's so funny?
- Oh, goodness gracious.
I don't get it.
Oh, yes, indeed.
Fancy meeting you here?
- I don't get it.
- They tell me that you're...
That you're quite a hand with the ladies.
I hope I'm as good a hand here with Hattie.
- As you think you are with the ladies?
- All right. All right.
Hey. Hey. How about me?
- Hi. Are you Danny Churchill?
- Yeah.
Well, I'm Henry Lathrop.
- Glad to know you.
- How are you?
I'm sorry about jumping over you.
We didn't see you.
Well, that's all right.
We'll show you where to register and the dean's office...
...and the mess hall and then to your room.
- Swell.
- Come on, let's go.
Hi.
This is Danny Churchill, just got in from New York.
This is Bud Livermore, you're roommate.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hi.
Big day tomorrow.
See you in the morning, about 6:00.
Yeah.
Did...? Did he say 6:00?
- When do you sleep?
- We hit the hay pretty early.
- At about what time?
- All lights out at 9:30.
That's a quaint little hour.
Yeah, and the hay feels pretty good about then.
- What do you sleep on around here?
- These.
- No mattress?
- Yeah, right here.
You unroll them. I'll show you how.
I can see we put them down ourselves but who puts them up?
You put hooks on the side of the wall...
...and this room can become a nice little closet.
You get used to it.
They keep you so busy, most of the time you don't even notice it.
I'm curious.
What does a fellow do around here?
Well, you're up at 5:45.
Roll your cot, clean the room...
...and you're in the mess hall by 6:10.
On the days you don't wait on tables.
- Well, how about do you ever...?
- Then you're back in your room at 6:45.
- Until 7, your time's your own.
- Well, do you ever get...?
Then you go to classes until 10 minutes of 1, dinner until 1:30.
Then you have another 15 minutes to do anything.
Like playing 18 holes of golf.
Then in the afternoon, you work in the laboratory...
...or in the mine shaft or with the livestock, depending on your courses.
- Don't you get...?
- Until 5:45.
Then come back to your room for supper.
After supper, you study till 9:30 and then you go to bed.
In a wheelchair, no doubt.
- So you see, it's a pretty full day.
- I'd say so.
Except Saturday, we have the afternoon off from 3 till 6.
Oh, goody, goody.
And at night we see movies, sometimes talkies.
Talkies?
Well, that sort of rounds out the whole week, doesn't it?
Yeah. I'll go take a shower now before I do anything else...
I forgot to tell you...
...the showers are out back, there aren't too many of them.
You have to write your name on a slip of paper...
...and put it in the box in the hall.
The monitor checks it when you can use them.
The best day is Saturday.
Good morning.
Hey, come on.
Hey, you gotta get up.
- Up and at them.
- No, no, no.
- Come on.
- Look. I'll tell them. I'll tell them.
- Fine. When he gets here, I'll tell them.
- Come on. Come on. Up you get.
Yeah, 48 states in America and
I have to wake up in a bureau drawer.
- What was that?
- The gong. You get used to it.
- Yeah. Like hanging.
- Come on, will you get up there?
- Fine. I'm up.
- Come on.
I jump right out of bed, see?
Okay. Fine.
What, no Indians?
- Hi, you lads.
- Hello, Bud.
- How are you?
- How did you sleep?
Sleep? I hardly yawned.
Well, wait till you get your lungs full of some of that good fresh air.
- Here you are. Climb into these.
- What are these?
We're going on an all-day ride.
Do it every two weeks.
- Well, where to?
- Nowhere in particular.
We ride up into the hills and spend the night...
...and we come home in the morning.
Well, if it's all the same to you fellows,
I think I'll just sit this one out.
- No, you don't.
- Come on.
Come on, Dan. Come on, Dan.
Come on, fellows, let's go.
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, will you?
How do I look?
You look great, old man.
Yeah, well, if you bump into
Buffalo Bill, tell him not to worry.
That's a good one.
Hey, where'd everybody go?
Hey, who's riding that buck?
- Good morning.
- Hello, Rags.
- Ain't you coming along?
- As soon as I finish the mail.
Hurry. There's no point to these rides unless you barbecue them steaks.
I'll be there.
What's holding everything up?
We're waiting for Park Avenue to mount Whitey.
Oh, fine. I gotta see that.
I hope you fellows have a spirited animal for me...
...because I'm a guy that likes a horse with plenty of zoom.
- I think we can arrange that.
- Well, where is he?
There he is, Whitey.
Well, I'll see you later.
Why, you'll love Whitey.
He's as meek as a lamb.
Hey, what's that?
The new guy from New York.
He's riding Whitey.
Wait a minute.
You want me to climb up on that?
Why, sure.
All right, boys, let's go.
Whitey.
Hey, Whitey.
Whitey, please.
What have I done?
Hi there.
Can I give you a lift?
Anything you could give me would be an improvement.
You're that young fellow from New York, ain't you?
No. No.
I'm that old fellow from New York.
- Who are you?
- I'm Rags, New York City.
Checker Cab Company, Class of 1933.
Yeah, you haven't got a checkered cab with you, have you?
No, but I got a buckboard.
I can take you up to the camp in that.
- What camp?
- With the boys.
Hey, where's Whitey?
Whitey?
Oh, Whitey hit the road.
He'll stop when he gets back to the corral.
As far as I'm concerned, he can keep going until he hits Connecticut.
- Well, you ready to ride?
- Yeah.
If I can sit on my stomach.
What else do they do around here besides play cowboys and Indians?
The boys work pretty hard...
...especially since they threatened to close the school.
- Yeah? Why?
- I don't know.
Something about the legislature couldn't get enough unenrollments.
If it hadn't been for Armour and his granddaughter Ginger...
Ginger? Say, is that the girl that delivers the mail?
That's her. She's coming out to cook supper for the boys.
Tell me about her, will you?
Ain't nothing much to tell except that she's just wonderful.
- Everybody loves her.
- Are you sure it's just everybody?
Yeah. Especially Henry Lathrop.
Is he the fellow that goes around acting like he owns the place?
That's him.
I knew there was something about him I didn't like.
- Hi, Rags.
- Hey, you lost a tire.
Hey, Danny. Where's Whitey?
Who's that cowboy with you?
Did you enjoy the ride?
Yeah. I haven't had so much fun since I was shot out of a cannon.
Some fellows like to tiptoe
Through the tulips
Some fellows go on
Singing in the rain
Some fellows keep on painting skies
With rainbows
Some fellows go on swinging
Down the lane
But
I'm biding my time
Because that's the kind of guy I'm
While other folks grow dizzy
I'll keep busy
Biding my time
Next year
Next year
Something's bound to happen
This year
This year
I'll just keep on napping
I'm biding my time
Because that's the kind of guy I'm
There's no regretting
When I'm setting
Biding my time
I'm biding my time
Biding my time
Because that's the kind of guy I'm
Beginning on a Monday
Right through Sunday
Biding my time
- I'm biding my time
- I'm biding, biding
Cause that's the kind of guy I'm
That's I'm
Chasing away flies
How the day flies
Biding, biding my time
Yahoo
Yahoo
Stranger so long
I'll just go along
Biding
Biding
Biding
My time
This Western air certainly does bring out harmony, doesn't it?
It brings out a lot of things.
Ginger.
- Yes, Henry.
- You'd better be getting back.
- It's exactly 8:14.
- Yeah.
You know, the astounding thing, that in exactly 24 hours it'll be 8:14 again.
And just think, you'll be the first to know.
Come on, Corky, let's go.
Good night, fellows.
Good night, Ginger.
See you tomorrow.
Come on, fellows, let's turn in.
Hey.
What's so funny?
The strange things you see when you haven't got a gun.
Me. Me pay you for ride home.
Thank you very much.
The pleasure is all ours.
See you later, buddy. Home.
No, sir, it's not like that.
It's not the place.
The place is beautiful, but it just isn't for me.
You mean, it's the kind of a school you'd want to send your son to.
Yes, sir. That's it.
No, I'm sorry. I beg your pardon.
I didn't mean it quite like that.
That's all right, Danny, I understand.
It's kind of too bad, though.
Pardon me.
You know, your grandfather and I were roommates here.
Hello. Yes.
It's the registrar.
He wants to know if you're gonna start classes today.
Well...
Hello, Ed. No, he's going back.
Too much fresh air out here.
I don't want you to get the wrong impression, sir.
I have nothing personal against the school.
That's all right, son. I'd probably be just as unhappy in the Stork Club.
Say, your dad's gonna be kind of unhappy too, isn't he?
Take unhappy and multiply it by furious and add a little belligerent...
...and I think you've just about got it.
Come in.
Gramp, there's a friend of yours outside.
The maybe-maybe girl from never-never land, Ms. Polly Williams.
Hi, Grampo. Here I am C.o. D., F.o. B., and M.U.G.
Come on, honey, hang one on.
- There. That didn't hurt a bit, did it?
- Polly, I'm glad to see you.
I'm glad you said, "I'm glad to see you," because I'm glad you're glad to see me.
- Hi, neighbor.
- Excuse me, Danny.
- This is my grandchild. Ms. Ginger Gray.
- Yes, we've met before.
Yes. And this is my cousin
Ms. Polly Williams.
Mr. Daniel Churchill, Jr.
Hi, Church. How's your steeple?
Say, you know, junior, you're cute.
- Well, I...
- That's all right, junior.
I know just how you feel.
Here's some mail for you, Mr. Churchill.
Channel number five.
There's something loose in here.
Well, I think I'd better get going so I don't miss my train.
Danny, Ginger's having a big birthday party tonight. You better stay over.
I'd like to very much, but I've already wired my father.
You're missing some mighty fine singing.
Yes, sir.
Ginger's got plenty of snap.
I'm sure Mr. Churchill would find it rather dull.
Would you like me to drive you to the junction?
I don't...
It will be a pleasure.
I don't want you to miss that train.
- Thank you very much.
- Don't mention it.
It's very nice of you...
So long, junior.
See you in the pool room.
Just ask for Polly.
So long, Polly. Watch your crackers.
Nice day, isn't it?
Nice day yesterday.
What do you think the chances are for tomorrow?
Say, you by any chance aren't related to Harpo Marx, are you?
There's something I have to tell you.
And if I don't tell you,
I'm gonna hate myself.
I'll bet you'd be the only one.
You are the most precocious, overconfident, spoiled young man...
...I've ever had the misfortune to meet.
- I think you're cute too.
- As an added attraction, you're a quitter.
Why, you've been eating ice cream with a silver spoon...
...in a nice fat college for a long time that when you get out here...
...with plain people, you run for cover.
Wait a minute. Now it's my turn.
Did anyone tell you that you've got a face...
...like a two-week vacation with pay?
Did anyone ever tell you...
...you've got a nose cute enough to write a song about?
Did anyone tell you when a girl like you starts talking about a fellow like me...
...it means only one thing, that you're falling madly in love with him?
Did anyone ever tell you that a fellow in my state of mind...
...is apt to kiss a girl in your state of mind?
- I dare you.
- You what?
- I double-dare you.
- Double?
- You did it.
- I did?
Why, it's funny.
I didn't even notice it.
Have some pity on an Easterner
Show a little sympathy
No one possibly could be sterner
Than you have been with me
Now, there's a job that I'm applying for
Let me put it to you thus
It's a partnership I'm dying for
Mr. And Mrs. Us
Now, before you file it on the shelf
Let me tell you of myself
Oh, I'm the chappie to make you happy
I'll tie your shoesies
And chase your bluesies
Oh, lady, would you?
Oh, lady, could you use me?
Now, I'd shake the mat out
And put the cat out
I'd clean the garret and feed the parrot
Oh, lady, would you?
Oh, tell me. Could you use me?
Oh, do you realize what a good man
You're getting in me
I'm no Elk or Mason or Woodman
Who gets home at 3
The girls who see me
Grow soft and dreamy
But I'm a gander who won't philander
Oh, could you use me?
Because I certainly could use you
There's a chap I know in Mexico
Who's as strong as he can be
Eating nails and drinking Texaco
He is the type for me
There is one in California
More romantic far than you
When he sings "Ha-cha-cha-chornia"
I often think he'll do
But as for you, sir
I'm afraid you will never make
The grade
For you're no cowboy
You're soft and how, boy
I feel no muscle that's fit for tussle
I must refuse you
I cannot use you, excuse me
No night life for you
The birds would bore you
The cows won't know you
A horse would throw you
You silly man, you
To ask me, can you use me?
Though at love you may be a wizard
I'm wanting to know
Could you warm me up in a blizzard
Say, 40 below
Your ties are freakish
Your knees are weakish
You're not a spender, you elbow-bender
Though you can use me
I most certainly can't use you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Ginger
Happy birthday to you
A happy birthday to you
A happy birthday to you
A happy birthday, Miss Ginger
Happy birthday to you oh, thank you.
- Make a wish.
- Come on, Ginger, make a wish.
All right.
- One.
- Two, three.
Come on. Come this way.
Here it is.
Here it is.
For you, Miss Ginger.
"To Ginger, from all her fellows. "
- And that includes me.
- Go on, pull it.
- What, this?
- Sure. See what's in it.
All right.
Oh, it's beautiful.
Go on. Play something, Ginger.
And it plays.
Dozens of boys would storm up
I had to lock my door
Somehow I wouldn't warm up
To one before
What was it that controlled me?
What kept my love-life lean?
My intuition told me
You'd come on the scene
If you'll listen to the rhythm
Of my heartbeat
You will get
Just what I mean
Embrace me
My sweet embraceable you
Embrace me
You irreplaceable you
Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me
I love all the many charms
About you
Above all
I want my arms about you
Don't be a naughty papa
Come to baby
Come to baby, do
My sweet
Embraceable
- You
- Embrace me
My sweet embraceable you
Embrace me
You irreplaceable you
In your arms
I find love so delectable, dear
Doo-doo-doo
I'm afraid
It isn't quite respectable, dear
But hang it
Come on, let's glorify love
Ding-dang it
You'll shout encore if I love
Don't be a naughty baby
Come to papa, come to papa, do
My sweet embraceable
You
My sweet embraceable
You
I love all the many charms
About you
Above all
I want my arms about you
Don't be a naughty baby
- Come to Tommy
- Come to Georgie
- Come to Harry
- Come to Johnny
- Come to Bobby
- Come to baby, do
My sweet embraceable
You
Henry, do you think the night is this beautiful...
...just because it's my birthday?
Oh, I don't know. I'd say it was more or less of a coincidence.
Oh, you would?
- Ginger.
- Yes, Henry?
- Ginger, I'm a man of few words and...
- Yes, Henry?
Well, after approaching the subject from every standpoint very objectively...
...I think it would be to our mutual advantage if we became engaged.
- Engaged?
- Yes.
And after a respectable period of time,
I think we should be married.
Henry, this is so sudden.
Well, you know I like to put my cards on the table.
Yes, well, I think you could have taken out the joker.
Well?
- Well, what?
- Well, I'm waiting for an answer.
- Well, that's pretty complicated.
- It's really quite simple.
You're young, attractive, intelligent and I'm young and intelligent.
And all we need is a meeting of the minds.
Meeting of the minds?
Look, Henry, I think you're an awfully nice boy...
...and I'm very fond of you.
But you just don't ask a girl to marry you...
...like going to the hardware store to buy a coffee grinder.
You don't come up to a girl and say:
"The humidity's high for this time of year. Will you marry me?"
Well, I just didn't want to get romantic.
You just didn't want to get romantic.
What are you saving it for?
I thought we were above that sort of thing.
Well, Henry, maybe you are.
I hope I'm not.
Very well, Ginger, I'm not discouraged.
Shall we go back?
No, you go ahead.
I'm going to stay out here and just look at everything.
As you wish.
What are you doing here?
I just got to thinking about what you said in the car...
...and I got to thinking that you were right.
Besides, I heard you were getting married...
...so I came back to offer my services.
- In what capacity?
- Best man.
Well, I'm not getting married.
I didn't think so.
I just said, I didn't think so.
Oh, you didn't think so.
Have you been listening all the time?
No, really, I was trapped there.
He certainly does pack a terrific wallop.
- Who?
- Mr. Put-Your-Cards-on-the-Table.
He's a very nice fellow.
Yes, he's a very nice fellow.
Just the guy to get
Juliet off the balcony.
Well, there are other things besides making love.
Wait a minute. Don't start knocking that.
Are you going to be staying...
...around?
Yes.
I'm going to be staying... around.
I thought you hated it here?
Not anymore.
Well, what made you decide to stay...
...around?
Well, it could be the climate...
...around, but it isn't.
Or it could be my love for the great open spaces...
...but it isn't.
And again, it could be that I just like you.
Yeah. Yeah, it could be.
- Were you always out of your mind?
- No, no, no, just lately.
And gosh, it's wonderful.
- I think I'd better get back to the party.
- Oh, wait a minute.
- Here, I've got a present for you.
- For me?
Sure. My grandmother gave it to my father, and he gave it to me.
It's lucky.
It's beautiful. My.
That's me, before and after.
- You haven't changed much.
- Only I dress better now.
I can't take it if it's your lucky piece.
No, go ahead and keep it.
I won't need it now.
Now that you're around.
Gosh, first a piano and now this.
It's quite a birthday.
Would you do something for me?
Well, remember the kiss that I gave you this afternoon?
Would you mind giving it back to me?
Oh, well, if that's the way you feel about it.
- Happy birthday.
- What?
Happy birth...
Come in.
- Hi, Rags.
- Hi, Mr. Churchill.
- How are you feeling?
- Well, great, as long as I don't sit down.
Mr. Churchill, I knew you wasn't gonna walk out on us.
You did? How?
I wasn't one of those taxi jockeys in New York for nothing.
You ain't the kind that'll hop out of a cab in the middle of traffic...
...just because the meter's gonna jump.
Thanks, Rags.
- Will you do something for me?
- Anything.
- Will you send this telegram for me?
- Sure.
I'll phone it in from the post exchange.
Thanks. Here's something for your trouble.
- No, that's all right.
- Why not?
Oh, no, I never touch the stuff.
Money's just like women and popcorn...
...the more you get the more you want.
I ain't had change for a quarter in 10 years...
...and, boy, am I a happy guy.
- Hello, Rags. How are you?
- Mr. Lathrop.
- Would you do me a favor, please?
- Sure.
- Send this before the station closes.
- Well, there's the telephone right there.
Well, I can't go around reading other people's mail.
Have a sandwich?
Oh, no, thanks.
Had too much birthday cake.
"Mr. Daniel Churchill Sr.
New York Union,
Times Square, New York City.
Dear Dad, have changed my mind. " Stop.
"Am not leaving Cody. " Stop.
"This school has as much personality as a cup of cold cocoa...
...and I still think the place is pretty snerpy. "
- Excuse me, I made a...
- Go ahead, Tom.
"And the students here play cowboys and Indians...
...but you know a Churchill never quits. "
Stop.
"There's something about this place that fills a fellow with plenty of ginger. "
Stop. "I would appreciate check by Pony Express.
Love, Danny Boy. " Thanks, Ed.
Cowboys and Indians?
Come on, fellows.
- What's going on, Henry?
- I'm calling a mass meeting tonight.
What for?
To discuss the dismissal of Danny Churchill Jr.
- Why?
- Read the telegram he sent his father.
"Dear Dad, changed my mind.
Am not leaving Cody. "
Danny Churchill or no Danny Churchill?
He won't change the school to his liking.
The student council will take care of this.
Come on.
- Did you put this up on the board?
- I did.
I think you and I better step outside.
You know, this Western air fools you.
It makes you feel extra brave.
All right, so you're taller than I am.
- I think that we'd...
- No, I'm all right.
- I can take care of myself.
- Well, all right.
Why, Henry here is the boxing champ of the school.
Do you want to step outside or not?
Mr. Churchill, Mr. Lathrop, the dean wants you in the office.
- Do you know what he wants?
- No, I don't, but he's steaming.
- Good day.
- How are you, sir?
Little excitement going on here?
- Yes, sir.
- What seems to be the trouble?
- It seems...
- We found...
From left to right, please.
- It's about this telegram.
- I've been informed of its contents.
This is my fault.
Those are my sentiments.
I'm sorry I feel the way I do, but I do.
I feel as though I've caused enough trouble here.
I think the best thing for me to do is resign.
Young man, you are the resign-est fellow I ever saw.
- Yes, sir.
- All you've done since you arrived...
...was unpack, pack and resign.
- Yes, sir.
- Would you tell me something?
- Yes, sir.
Just what is the meaning of the word "snerpy"?
Well... Well, a snerp...
...is a looging with a belt in the back.
Sometimes referred to as a diljo.
- A diljo is a...
- Never mind. I have a rough idea.
- Henry Lathrop.
- Yes, sir?
What prompted you put that notice on the board?
- The student council had a meeting...
- A meeting?
Every time a cow coughs, that council has a meeting.
Where's my glass?
We felt if that was Mr. Churchill's opinion, he didn't belong here.
You did? If you'd been minding your own business...
...you wouldn't know what people are saying in private telegrams.
If you didn't know that, there wouldn't have been a meeting.
- Sir, we were only...
- Would there?
- No.
- Supposing we forget all about it.
- But the student council...
- Hoot on the student council.
There's my glass.
- Lf this young man thinks we're a...
- A diljo?
A diljo, that's his privilege.
- We're still in America, aren't we?
- Yes, sir.
Well, that gives him a right to call us a diljo.
As for you, supposing you stop unpacking, packing and resigning...
...and start learning something around here?
Yes, sir.
Well, get going, both of you.
Oh, just a minute.
There's another American custom.
Well, don't stand there like
Ike and Mike, scoot.
- Hi, boys.
- Hi, dean.
Hello, Gramps.
Ginger, have we a slang dictionary?
What's your problem?
What word do you want?
Looging.
- Looging?
- With a belt in the back.
Flash. The legislature today... 
... in conjunction with
the new education bill... 
... has ordered Cody College
to be closed next year. 
Reason given by legislature:
Applications for enrollment
have fallen off to an extent... 
... that they decided
to withdraw school's charter. 
The bill awaits Governor Tait's
signature. 
What does that mean?
The school closes.
Well, that's impossible.
- Did you know about it?
- Yes.
Well, they can't do that.
- Let's do something about it.
- I've done all I could.
- Lf he signs that...
- Don't worry.
After all these years...
Gramp.
Well, I just can't stand here.
I better call a meeting, tell them about it.
What will you do if you lose the school?
Oh, I'll find some other kind of business, I reckon.
I'm getting kind of tired of the boys, anyhow.
- Hi there.
- Hello.
Any mail for me?
No, not today.
Ginger, about forwarding my mail...
Here. You can fill that out.
Well, I guess now that the college is closing, all your problems are settled.
Look, Ginger, I'm not gonna be a hypocrite and say:
"I'm sorry the place is closing," because I'm not.
But I am sorry about leaving you.
Hey, come on.
Things aren't really that bad.
I'm sorry, but poor Gramp.
All his life, he worked so hard for the place.
Why, every boy that came in there was just like his own.
Here, blow.
Blow. Blow.
Ginger,
I'm not going back to New York.
- You're not?
- No, I'm gonna stay right here.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not getting sentimental.
I don't care about the school.
As far as I'm concerned...
...it's just a place to look at from an upper berth.
But, well, I...
I do care about you.
- You do?
- Yes, I do.
What they need here's a less cheering and more operation.
You bet.
Let's go to the dean's. We'll give him something to cheer about.
- All right.
- Are you through with that?
- Yeah.
- Thanks. Come on.
- May we ask you a question, please?
- Why, certainly.
How many applications do you need for next year's freshman class?
Oh, about 125.
You mean if 125 applied for admission, that you'd get the appropriation?
- That's right.
- It's very simple.
What made Dartmouth famous?
The Dartmouth Winter Carnival.
What put Southern California on the map?
The Rose Bowl.
What made Notre Dame a household word?
Football teams.
Every college in the country was made famous by some event.
What's the springboard for Cody College?
A Western rodeo.
Once a year we'll bring back the West.
- Daniel Boone.
- Jesse James and Buffalo Bill.
- Beautiful girls.
- On horseback.
- Glorious costumes. Happy. Carefree.
- Gay.
Once a year, we'll choose the most beautiful girl.
We'll make her Queen of the Rodeo.
Sure. Little kids will be begging their mothers to send them out here.
Well, it's fantastic.
All we want is your permission to see the governor.
Well, I've lived through three blizzards, an epidemic and four wars in my time.
I guess I could stand a hundred beautiful girls.
- On horseback.
- On horseback.
Danny, I give you the governor.
Hey. Hey. Egghead.
- Ma'am.
- You took the wrong road.
So I did.
Yes, I'll call you as soon as I can make an appointment with the governor.
Not at all. Thank you.
"Governor's daughter makes debut tonight.
Marjorie Tait, season's popular deb, official hostess at inaugural ball. "
- She's a pretty girl.
- Domestic, isn't she?
What time is it?
Four o'clock.
- Excuse me, sir, but don't you...
- I'm sorry...
...but the governor is still busy with a special committee.
And besides, he's seeing no one today except by appointment.
Not even a Republican?
What are we gonna do?
Stand up, Ginger, and let me...
Let me see that dress.
Will you? For a minute, please?
Stand up and let me...
Let me see your dress.
My, my.
It's awfully pretty. Blue is nice on you.
Yes, sir. Very, very pretty.
Yes, you...
...certainly, certainly look nice.
What'd you write on that...?
Would you take this into the governor?
I hate to bother you like this.
"Dear Bill, in town for the day.
Could you see me a minute?
Regards, Dan. "
Now, young fellow, we can't have any of that.
Please, take it in. I'll bet he'll see me.
- What are you trying to do, get me fired?
- No.
- The governor has a broadcast here...
- Please, if he doesn't see us, we'll leave.
- Yeah.
- Well, all right.
- Can we leave the equipment here?
- Yes.
The room we'll use for the broadcast is down the hall.
I'll show it to you.
I don't think we're gonna get to see him.
Oh, sure we will.
Here we are at Forest Hills...
...bringing you the tennis matches between Covas and Lopez from Mexico.
Miss Covas is about to serve.
It's an excellent serve, cross-handed.
Back-handed cross-court.
Miss Covas outside.
It's 40-love, match point.
Miss Lopez is about to serve now.
She asked that everybody in the gallery be silent.
It's an excellent serve.
It's cross-courted back-hand.
There's a volley.
Out.
We're about to bring you the main event between champion Joe Louis...
...and the contender, Johnny Paycheck.
As yet, both boys have not come into the ring...
...but we expect them at any moment.
And here's Harry Bellows announcing in the center of the ring.
Introducing the main contestants of the evening...
...15 rounds of boxing...
...for the heavyweight championship of the world...
...from Des Moines, Iowa, weighing 187 and a quarter pounds...
...wearing black trunks,
Johnny Paycheck.
Stand up, Paycheck. Take a bow.
Okay, okay.
And his worthy opponent, considered the greatest heavyweight of all times...
...from Detroit, weighing 202 and a quarter pounds...
...wearing purple tights, Joe Louis.
Stand up, Louis, take a bow.
Hello, Joe. Here's the bell for round one and your announcer, Clem McCarthy.
Good evening, thanks very much.
Louis stalks him with a left hand.
It's the same old Joe Louis that we've seen time and time again.
He tries with a left hand to the body.
Paycheck bounced away.
He didn't like the blow at all.
Louis caught him with a left hand.
Paycheck is down.
The count is one, two, three.
Ladies and gentlemen, referee Arthur Donovan...
...has stopped the bout and it's Louis, by a knockout.
Stick around. We'll try and get a few words from the champion.
Pardon us. Can we get through?
Hey, Joe. Joe, Joe, Joe.
Ladies and gentlemen, here's Joe Louis.
Tell us about the fight as long as it lasted.
Joe, did he hurt you in the first round?
Joe Louis.
Thank you very, very much, ladies and gentlemen.
It was a tough fight. If I fight him again maybe I'll still keep the championship.
- That's very funny.
- Yeah.
Well, don't you think you better stop shrieking with laughter?
I don't feel like laughing.
You're getting to be a regular problem child.
Even worse than that kid I used to know, the kid with the electric leg.
- Electric leg?
- Yeah.
A fellow I know stepped on a high-tension wire.
Oh, we saved his life, but from then on, his leg was always magnetized.
What? Is he all right now?
I don't know.
I haven't seen him lately.
But you shouldn't let a situation like this aggravate you.
After all, worrying never solved anything.
Remember what Shakespeare once said:
"He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
But, soft! What light through yonder window breaks?
'Tis the east and Juliet is the sun. "
Do you really think we'll get to see the governor?
I take an oath.
- What if he turns us down?
- Oh, he hasn't got a leg to stand on.
And neither have I.
Now we present George Armour Allan, and the news.
Take it away, New York.
Mr. Churchill.
Mr. Churchill?
Oh, excuse me.
The governor will see you immediately.
- This way, please.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you, sir.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- Yes.
- Remember our bet.
- Hurry up. Hurry up.
Mr. Churchill.
Well, it's certainly good...
Why, what is it, young man?
Well, what can I do for you, son?
Well, who are you?
What's your name?
Really now...
Mr. Governor, my name is Ginger Gray...
...and this quiet fellow here is Danny Churchill.
Dan Churchill?
- That's impossible. L...
- Junior.
Junior.
- Are you Dan Churchill's son?
- Yes.
- Yes, sir.
- Hello, Dan.
- How's your dad?
- Well...
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
What's on your mind?
This is Ginger.
She's the granddaughter of Dean Armour.
Dean Armour? Really?
I talked to him on the phone.
I know. That's why we came to see you.
I'm a student there.
You are? I didn't know that.
I am. Mr. Governor, you can't close down that college.
I'm afraid I have nothing to do with it.
The legislature passed the bill.
I know, but the bill's no good unless you sign it.
I know, Ms. Gray, but I have to sign it,
I'm afraid.
Suppose you gave us more time.
Suppose a lot of applications came in...
...then you won't have to sign the bill?
- But what makes you think they will?
I have a feeling a lot of boys will wanna go to Cody College next year.
- Yes, sir.
- Just what do you me want to do?
- Give us 30 days.
- Yeah.
And if nothing happens within that time, then go ahead and sign the bill, sir.
I'm a reasonable man.
All right.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
I won't even ask how it's going to be done.
You're on the air in five minutes, sir. 
Sorry, I have to run.
My daughter's giving a big party.
Would you like to come?
I can't.
I have to get back, but Danny can go.
Oh, well, thanks very much but all I have is this pinstripe suit.
- Wish I could wear one.
- You go ahead.
- I don't really feel as though I...
- Go on.
You know. Go on.
- All right. Thank you, sir, very much.
- Fine.
- Say hello to your grandfather.
- I will, thank you.
- I'll see you later.
- All right, sir. Goodbye.
Danny.
- For you, John.
- Thank you, sir.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- Hello.
- How about it?
We've got the governor in the palm of our hands.
Great. Set the capitol right on its dome?
- Oh, get in, will you, Polly?
- Don't forget to see the newspapers.
- No.
- And call the newsreel men.
- Don't forget the photographers.
- I'll swamp them.
Please be sure and ask the governor's daughter down.
I'll get her. Don't worry.
All right. Here, I wanna give you something.
Oh, what's that for?
Well, you're going to need an awful lot of luck.
All right.
Say, you gonna be busy on Sunday, say, in about 50 years?
No, I don't think so.
Would you like to help me celebrate my golden wedding anniversary?
I'd love to, if you don't think your wife would mind.
All right, Rags.
Well, come on around.
All right, get going.
And no shortcuts.
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hey, Danny. I'm glad to see you.
What are you doing here?
I heard you're looking for a short piano player.
- You can sit in anytime.
- How long will you be around?
We play a theater and at the Upton Hotel.
- Are you doing anything on the 17th?
- Seventeenth? Not that I know of.
- Then you've got a job.
- Swell.
- There you are.
- Hello, Marjorie.
Do you think you have time to meet 12 beautiful girls?
Not more than six at a time.
- I'll dig you later, Tom.
- Solid.
I think you're one of the most beautiful girls I ever saw.
You do?
I wouldn't be surprised if you were chosen Queen of the Rodeo.
That would be really exciting.
Oh, well, I can't make any promises, but I could go to work on it.
Oh, that's so sweet of you.
You know, I think you're one of the most beautiful girls I ever saw.
Oh, that's a rather big statement.
Oh, I've seen an awful lot of girls.
And my picture will be in all the papers?
- After all, my father owns 14 and...
- oh, Danny, you're so fascinating.
In a small way, but fascinating.
I think you're one of the most beautiful girls I ever saw.
Do you really?
Yes. I've got books at home to prove it.
Oh, Danny, let's do sit the next one out.
We certainly all shall. Come.
Do you think the boys might choose me queen?
I'm chairman of the committee and
I've got an awful good ear for music.
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.
- Danny, you're delightful.
Oh, I'm sorry. Here.
My, what a lovely locket.
- Did a girl give it to you?
- No, I've had it for quite some time.
- Precious. Do you mind if I try it on?
- I'd rather you wouldn't, because I...
- May I?
- Well, I don't know.
- Certainly, darling. Excuse me.
- Yeah.
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, with your kind permission...
...presenting the music of that great
American composer...
...Mr. George Gershwin.
Our own arrangement of "Fascinating Rhythm. "
All right, everybody.
The polls are now open.
Step up and vote for the Queen of the Rodeo.
- Come on, everybody vote.
- Only vote for one at a time, folks.
- Polls are now open.
- Ballots right here.
Get your ballots.
- Hi, Church.
- How's your steeple?
How did you know? Fine. Say, are there really going to be 100 pretty girls here?
You bet there are.
I can see I'm in for a very quiet weekend.
Wait a minute.
Listen, have you seen the dean?
- Yeah.
- Is he still happy?
He's happy, but getting older.
Hey, Mr. Danny,
I sure hope Miss Ginger wins.
Are you crazy? She better hadn't.
Who better had?
The governor's daughter.
Wait a minute. I thought you told
Miss Ginger she'll win.
Oh, I've told a lot of girls they're gonna win.
- Why?
- We need the publicity.
I think she's wonderful...
...and I'm terribly in love with her...
...but she just isn't news, Rags.
Mr. Danny, that's a lovely pair of boots you got on, but I'd hate to be in them.
Hey, Danny.
Hey, Dan, come here.
- Where have you been?
- Been counting up the votes.
- You're in the biggest trouble I ever saw.
- The junior league wants me for murder.
Oh, tornado coming.
Oh, Bud.
- Have you seen him yet?
- Who?
- Danny Churchill.
- Oh, Danny.
No, I haven't.
I think he went to sleep.
To sleep?
Yeah, he's got a pretty big day tomorrow.
Girls, I think I see Danny.
- Where?
- Inside.
Oh, thanks.
- Where is Ginger?
- She's inside.
You're gonna get fat if you don't stop eating all those bananas.
When you look like me from the neck up...
...from the neck down is no problem.
Do you really think I'll win the crown tonight?
Are you kidding?
The rest of those dames aren't even on the same floor with you.
You know what you ought to do...
Hey. Hey, Ginger. Hey.
Oh, that's fine, card tricks.
What is it, Danny?
Ginger, you like me quite a bit, don't you?
I think we're safe in saying that.
Well, I think you know how I feel about you.
I think so.
Remember once you told me that about 100 years ago...
...an Indian pushed that rock from the other side of that mountain...
...just to prove to a girl that he was on the level...
...and she was the only one he cared about?
That's right.
Well, I want you to know that no matter what happens tonight or anytime...
...I'd move that rock on the other side of the mountain, any day, any night.
It's a pretty tall mountain.
We've got them taller than that.
Come on, let's go back to the dance.
- The crowd's wonderful, isn't it?
- Yeah.
I guess the good-luck locket's really working.
Danny, could I have it back now?
I mean, just so that maybe
I could win the crown tonight.
Well, Ginger, I forgot to tell you, but I lost it on the road.
- Hi there.
- Hi.
Hello, Gramp.
Well, what do you think of it all?
Well, I kind of lost track of the whole thing miles back.
- Isn't it nice? Danny, you really...
- Ginger.
Would you care to dance with Ginger?
Go ahead. It's fine.
- Well, Danny...
- Have fun. Dance.
- Would you like to get some air?
- I'd love to.
Danny. Danny Churchill.
Wait a minute, that's you.
Why, they're calling you.
- Well, go on up.
- Danny.
Oh, Danny.
- Danny.
- Attention, please.
And now, the high point of our little jamboree.
Mr. Danny Churchill will crown the most attractive...
...the most popular, the most everything girl...
...Queen of the Rodeo.
You're about to see a man buried alive.
Ladies and gent...
Ladies and gentlemen.
I want to thank you all for coming here tonight.
Especially the ladies.
There's nothing that I'd rather do than this.
Thank you, Tom.
Looks a little nervous, doesn't he?
- He's a study.
- Yeah.
In suicide.
There have been so many sensational girls here tonight...
...that it's been quite a problem.
But it had to be done, anyhow.
And I thought that the voting was so close...
...that you should meet the two girls...
...who came down the stretch together.
The delightful and talented...
...and lovely, Miss Ginger Gray.
And now the gracious...
...and lovely daughter of the governor...
...Miss Nancy Tait.
I mean Miss Marjorie Tait.
And now...
...for the queen.
It's with great pleasure...
...and honor...
...on behalf of Cody College... oh, I can't look at this.
...to award the crown to...
...Miss Marjorie Tait.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
I'm very happy...
Lost it on the road?
What's she doing, hitchhiking?
- Ginger, I can explain everything.
- Danny, wait, the crown.
There.
Where do you want me to ship the body?
Ginger, listen to me.
Remember what I told you about moving the rock.
I wouldn't believe you if you moved a mountain.
Ginger.
Miss Ginger.
Oh, Miss Ginger, you can't do that.
That's for kids.
Oh, Rags, I feel so miserable.
Oh, Miss Ginger...
...you know I've known you since you were that high...
...and I saw you fall off horses and get run over...
...but, gee, I never saw you cry.
- You know what I came out here for?
- What?
You remember one day you told me that...
Well, if ever I felt lonesome...
...that you'd sing me a song just for me?
Well, I feel lonesome.
Old man sunshine, listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it
And I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax, don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear
From any cheerful
Pollyannas
Who tell you
Fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas
They're writing songs
Of love
But not for me
A lucky star's above
But not for me
With love to lead the way
I've found more skies of gray
Than any Russian play
Could guarantee
I was a fool
To fall
And get that way
Heigh-ho alas
And also lacka-day
Although I can't dismiss
The memory
Of his kiss
I guess
He's not
For
Me
Rags, what's the matter?
I feel so much better now.
Oh, Rags, don't cry.
Ginger.
Ginger.
Who's going away?
I am.
Where?
Back East with Polly.
Back East?
Why?
Lots of reasons.
When?
Pretty soon.
Ginger.
Ginger, look at me.
I'm looking.
I'm sorry.
You're not looking at me now.
I'm really sorry about your grandfather and the school...
...and about your not winning the crown.
You're not angry with me really, are you?
No.
And you know that I'm really sorry?
Yes.
Will you...?
Will you write to me?
No.
Why not?
Because I won't have anything to write.
I will, though.
- You will?
- Yeah, lots of things.
About how I fell in love with you...
...under an old transmission...
...and how I felt like cutting off my right arm...
...after I gave that other girl the crown.
Oh, I... I don't care about that.
You're not looking at me.
Ginger.
Wait. I want to tell you about the locket.
- I don't wanna hear about it.
- Well, here it is.
Why, I don't want it.
- I don't even wanna touch it.
- Take it, please?
Every time I'll look at it, I'll hate myself for the rest of my life.
Oh, won't you, please?
Did you ever...?
Ever kiss that debutante?
I take an oath.
Did you ever want to?
Never mind, don't answer that.
Ginger.
- We tried to make a three-ring...
- Hallelujah. Excuse me.
- Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah.
- What's the meaning of this?
- Cody comes to life.
- You keep out of this.
- No, sir.
Why, hello, Dad.
Do you know this school isn't going to close?
- It isn't?
- No. Look at this.
- Applications for admittance.
- To this school.
- Next year.
- Over 200 of them.
- The governor can't close the school.
- He can't?
Now, get yourself all set now.
Are you ready?
- Ready for anything.
- Yeah.
These applications are from girls.
- From what?
- Girls.
Why not make the school coeducational?
- Oh, no.
- Didn't I tell you girls had a future?
I always said you were girl crazy.
I was wrong. You're just crazy.
- Wait a minute.
- I don't feel that way. It's a good idea.
No, not you.
Get me the governor.
You heard me, the governor. Yes.
- And reverse the charges.
- Oh, Gramp.
- Is everybody having fun?
- Yeah.
That's only the beginning.
Now, the golden voice of the golden
West, our own Ginger Gray.
Singing "I Got Rhythm" accompanied by Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra...
...and that ain't hay.
Days can be sunny with never a sigh
Don't need what money can buy
Birds in the tree sing
Their day full of song
Why shouldn't we sing along?
I'm chipper all the day
Happy with my lot
How do I get that way?
Look at what I've got
I got rhythm
I got music
I got my man
Who could ask for anything more?
I got daisies in green pastures
I got my man
Who could ask for anything more?
Old man trouble, I don't mind him
You won't find him around my door
I got starlight
I got sweet dreams
I got my man
Who could ask for anything more?
Who could ask for anything more?
Who could ask, who could ask
Who could ask for anything more?
- I got rhythm, I got music
- I got rhythm, I got music
- I got my man
- Who could ask for anything more?
I got daisies in green pastures
I got my man
Who could ask for anything more?
- Old man trouble, I don't mind him
- Old man trouble, I don't mind him
- You won't find him
- You won't find him
Hanging round my front or back door
I got starlight
I got sweet dreams
I got my man
Who could ask for anything more?
Who could ask for anything more?
I got rhythm
I got music
I got my man
Who could ask... ?
Who could ask... ?
Who could ask
For anything more than daisies?
Starlight, sweet dreams
Hanging round my front door
Hanging round my back door
Hanging round my side door
- I got starlight
- I got starlight
- I got sweet dreams
- I got sweet dreams
- I got my man
- I got my man
Who could ask for anything more?
Who could ask for anything more
Than music and rhythm?
I got rhythm
She's got rhythm
He's got rhythm
We got rhythm, yeah
They got it
They got it
We got it
Rhythm
- Who could ask for anything
- Who could ask for anything
- More?
- More?
- Hey, you. Keep moving.
- Which way, officer?
- I should worry which way, keep moving.
- But which way?
You figure that out for yourself, just keep moving.
"Just keep moving." Hospitality at the end of a nightstick.
In or out, come or go. Who cares? Nobody.
There's no welcome sign out in New York.
You get off a freight train and the railroad bulls slap you around just for the exercise.
Every day, the big parade comes in, shaking their fists...
...but nobody gives them a welcome.
All you get is a stop signal at every corner.
Hey, daffy, didn't I just tell you to keep moving?
Officer, I'm city-struck.
This is my breakfast, talking up to the big town.
Look at it. Seven million people, fighting, biting, clawing away...
...to get one foot on a ladder that'll take them to a penthouse.
Yes, siree. They come by the thousands, every which way.
By water, by wheel, by foot, by ferry, by tunnel, by tube.
Over, across and under the river.
They come like locusts, from all over the nation.
From every nation on the globe. Seven million people.
New York is like a snake.
Strike the head in Queens and the tail waves in Staten Island.
Rattle a milk can in the Bronx and a corpse turns over in Brooklyn.
Seven million people, divided by a river and joined by bridges.
Go from the subway to the sky in 10 seconds flat.
Make a million. Make a penny. That's New York.
And I know this town, brother.
Because I got clothes on my back.
But before I turn you in, you better get moving.
I heard you, officer, and I wanna keep moving.
- I still can't figure out which way.
- You better figure out which way...
...or I'll give you a taste of this. Now, go on.
You coming with me?
Hey. Just a minute, young fella.
- I didn't do nothing.
- Well, we'll discuss that later.
- What's your name?
- Googi, Googi Sabatini.
Well, Googi, you mustn't steal bread.
You can steal boats, you can snitch nickels or shake down trousers...
...but you mustn't steal bread.
But I'm hungry.
Who isn't in this town?
Come on, give it to me.
Hand it over. Come on, come on. Hurry up.
And remember, Googi, if you must steal bread in New York, don't get caught.
Only one cent, two cent, three cent.
What a town. Right out of the asphalt flower's grove.
That's Peggy, Danny's girl.
- And who's Danny?
- That's me.
Attaboy, Danny.
Use your right, Danny! Hit him in the discus!
- Don't get so excited, son. He'll win.
- You're doggone right, he'll win.
- Attaboy, Danny!
- Scram!
The winner.
Danny, I now dub you knight of the Round Table.
King Arthur was no braver in defense of his fair lady.
Sure, I'm taking Peggy's part and
I always will because she's my girl.
- Peggy couldn't have a better protector.
- You said it.
- You hurting much, Peggy?
- No, it's nothing. Thanks, Danny.
- You know what, Peggy?
- Yes, Danny?
- You dance good.
- You fight good.
Come on, Danny, let's finish this game. Hurry up.
Eddie, your brother wants you to come on over. We're gonna play Kick the Can.
- Tell Danny I can't. I gotta practice.
- You give me a pain.
Every time we need you, why, you gotta practice.
Well, I can't give it up. I'm teaching myself.
You know, someday I'm gonna get a piano.
Heck, a piano!
Yes, siree, brother. The air of New York smells of ambition.
Blessed is he who goes after what he wants.
Every man climbs over the backs of the others, swinging his spiked club.
Fighting, dancing, playing away.
Up from the gutters, into the sun.
And yet, if you look close, there's love in the city.
And there's hope in the city too.
The pavements may be hard and the tenements high...
...but that won't stop these children.
Googi may steal his way through life.
Peggy, well, you've seen her dance. Her nimble feet will carry her to the heights.
And Danny will fight his way through with his bare fists.
- Lay off those peanuts.
- They're good for your nerves.
- They're bad for the figure.
- I never worried about me figure. Want one?
Get through with that bag,
Danny. Callahan's here.
- That Kid Callahan?
- Yeah. Up from the West Side.
Just knocked out Tony Mazzini. Remember Tony?
- When he busted his thumb on your head?
- Tony was tough. This guy must be good.
Yeah. You could be good too, only you don't wanna.
Hey, look out there, will you?
- Hi, Kid. You sure gave Tony the flatiron.
- He was a pushover. He ain't seen nothing.
- Hey, Kid, when's your next settle?
- Don't ask me.
- Just sit tight, boys. Leave it to Goldie.
- Hurry up. Get through with the bag.
- I'll be through when you're dressed.
- You'll be through when I'm dressed?
You're through right now. Scram.
You big lug. You think you own the joint?
Danny could knock your block off with one hand.
- Beat it, dope, beat it.
- Keep your mitts off him.
A wise, guy, huh?
- What's the big idea, you jerk?
- He started it. He slapped him with the bag.
Let me at that guy. Let me at him. Let me at him.
Break it up. This ain't the ring. What's eating you guys?
Listen, jerk. The next time I see you, you're gonna wish you hadn't.
Save it for the ring, Kid.
Look, Goldie, cool off that buzz saw of yours, will you?
Say, Kenny, stick around.
I wanna talk to you.
Don't worry, Pinky. We'll be there.
Listen, Samson. It's a chance in a million.
A main prelim, and you ain't taking...
Skip it, Pinky. You're wasting your time.
I come down here for a little exercise and you try to pull me into a fight.
Danny, 100 bucks. A hundred.
And I can handle your corner.
Better handle that truck back to the garage.
- Look, Danny...
- Stop hopping me up, you ringworm.
Danny, you can knock most of these guys around here cold.
- Why would I do that?
- A hundred bucks, Danny.
Lemonade, chocolate! Five cents! Five cents!
Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here. Five cents!
Going into the third round, Primo
Carnera, world's heavyweight champion...
... and challenger Maxie Baer.
California jabs with his left. One, two.
Now a right hook. Carnera staggers. He's going down.
- Looks like it's in the bag for Maxie.
- That's the cold packs for that big baloney.
His share of the gate tonight is estimated at a minimum of $ 100,000 cash.
You hear that, Danny, $
100,000. That's for one fight.
What are you crying about now?
I won't be a truck driver's assistant forever.
I got ambitions. I'm gonna be somebody.
Baer stabs two to the jaw, a hard right to the heart.
Carnera tries to hold on, a desperately groggy champ.
I got four bits bet and I'm gonna collect.
He's my boy. I don't care what you think of him.
He's all right, and I still have
3-1 to bet on Jess Willard to win.
Hey, Danny, there's Peggy.
- Hello, Peg.
- Hello, Danny.
I'll walk you over, huh?
- Don't you want to listen?
- I heard enough.
- Where you been, dancing again?
- Learned a lot of new steps today.
You'll wear yourself out if you keep dancing without supper.
- I'd much rather dance than eat any day.
- I know that.
Boy, was it crowded tonight on the subway.
Talk about sardines. They got it easy.
At least they're floating in olive oil.
Look, Peggy, I'm making 27.50 a week now.
This time next year, we could be all set...
Always whispering, you two.
Carrying on. Sneaking in the hallway.
I won't stand for it, Danny Kenny.
We're a respectable family, we are.
If you wanna marry my Peggy, you come into the parlor.
- Who's talking about marrying, Ma?
- Don't give me that sass.
My daughter talking to me like that after all I've done.
Mrs. Nash, we're just sitting here talking like always.
Talking. Whispering behind my back.
Afraid I'll hear you in the parlor.
There is no parlor. Just a kitchen and a bedroom, if you wanna call them that.
What's the use? See you later, Danny.
Come on in, Ma, and please stop worrying.
I swore my daughter would never go through what I did.
Skimping and saving, penny by penny, and losing it all and starving ever since.
All right, Sydney, that'll be all. Practice those scales an hour a day at least.
Here's a dollar. Mama said you should give me change. Fifty cents.
What about the two dollars from last month?
- Mama said it should be just on account.
- Say, Danny, got any change?
- How much you need?
- Half a buck.
There it is.
- Give this to Mama with my compliments.
- Okay.
Oh, yeah. And Mama says when you gonna give me a piece to learn?
She says to tell you she likes "The Blue Danube."
So do I. That's why you're not gonna play it yet, Sydney.
Okay.
I don't know why I keep giving that kid lessons. He throws the piano out of tune.
You get it from Sydney. I get it from the traffic cops.
- How's your music coming, Eddie? - So-so.
Look, Danny.
I wanted to ask you if there's a chance of getting a job with your boss.
- For who?
- Me.
- You?
- Yeah.
- Driving a truck?
- Or a helper, till I got a license.
Are you nuts? Another year, you'll be through music school.
- I'm through right now.
- What?
- What about your scholarship?
- Yeah, they cut it in half.
- Gotta pay the rest in cash.
- What happened?
Like everything else, donations slowing up, so they cut expenses.
It's no use, Danny. I've got to start making my own way.
But when will you find time to work on your own music?
- I'll find it sometime at night.
- You'll be all worn out.
Besides, you might even hurt your hands shoving those cases around on the truck.
- How much you gonna need for that school?
- Hundred and fifty bucks.
- And it might just as well be 150,000.
- Look here, Eddie.
I don't wanna hear any more talk like that.
- You're gonna finish up.
- Well, I wanna finish, Danny...
...and I wanna finish my own music too.
You know I've been working on it every minute.
Here, look. I've even got a new idea on it now.
To make it into a symphony of New York.
The song of the magic isle, a city for conquest.
A full symphony of it, with all its proud, passionate beauty...
...and all of its sordid ugliness and of its great wealth and power...
...and its everlasting hunger.
And of its teeming seven millions and its barren loneliness.
Here, listen, Danny. It starts with that part that you like.
That part that I call "The East River"...
...with the rumbling el over Allen
Street with its crowded gutters and slums.
With all of its mounting, shrieking jungle
- cries for life and sun.
And then carrying on the theme up to the towering skyscrapers...
...and the story of all those who tried to scale their dizzy heights...
...but crash, frustrated and broken, to the concrete pavements.
And then of those few who finally reach the top...
...only to find out that above them are still the unattainable stars.
Gee, Eddie, you have ideas like that and you're talking about driving a truck?
Play me that first part again. The part I like.
Sure.
- Maxie knocked him out in the 11 th.
- Quiet.
- What's the matter?
- Tell Pinky that fight with Callahan is okay.
- No kidding, Danny?
- Have you got no ear for music?
- Sure, I can hear it.
- All right.
Ladies and gentlemen, next bout of the evening.
At 146 pounds, the West
Side Terror, Kid Callahan.
And in this corner, at
144 and a half pounds...
...the former Golden Gloves winner, Danny Kenny...
...entering the professional ring as "Young Samson."
Take a bow, Danny.
- Where'd you get that moniker, Samson?
- The Bible. Wanna make something of it?
Hey, Danny, it's a cinch!
- Looks like a West Side turnout.
- Yeah.
Keep your left in his schnozzola.
When you see an opening, give him the old one-two. Good luck.
Folks, I just wanna say that these boys better be good...
...as we're honored to have with us tonight no less than manager Scotty MacPherson...
...down from Madison
Bowl. Take a bow, Scotty.
Who's the new lad, Pinky?
From the East Side. Won the
Golden Gloves five years back.
First fight since. Nothing much, Scotty.
Tell you what I'll do, Scotty, I'll lay you 20-10 that Callahan wins.
I'll tell you what, Bill. Make it a real bet and I'll lay 2-1 on Samson.
- For how much?
- I'll bet 200 to 100.
- You've got a bet.
- Let me in on that.
- Okay. Same bet with you.
- Goldie. Goldie.
Ain't you even gonna back up your own champ? Scotty's laying 2-1 on Samson.
It's a pleasure to oblige. Scotty,
I'll take 100 of that easy jack.
You're on. Anybody else?
If you're gonna be that generous, I'll double it. And I don't mind telling you...
Hey, what's going on? What's happened?
Two, three...
...four, five, six...
- What's happened?...seven, eight, nine...
...ten.
- You got me into this. I lose a fortune.
- Accident.
Holy smoke. A welterweight with a sock like Dempsey.
- Who's his manager, Scotty?
- I don't know, but I'll find out.
Listen. I don't usually go after a lad, but I'd a hunch on you the minute I saw you.
I believe I can manage you right up to the top rung.
That's very good to hear, but
I guess I just can't see it.
You'd sooner stick to that truck-driving job?
- Sure. I like it.
- You're very hard to figure out.
You've got the makings of a fighter but you don't like to fight.
I guess that's just it. I don't like it. I don't know how to explain it...
...but I need a good reason to sock a guy.
A reason? I'll give you a good reason.
I'll guarantee you $500 on your next card. How's that?
Skip it, Pinky. It's no go.
I've seen pugs who figured they had it licked. Where are they?
Walking around on their heels, punchy, all before their time.
Here. See that guy back there? Remember him?
Yes, I believe I do. Mickey Miller, isn't it?
- Nobody else. Great fighter, wasn't he?
- He certainly was.
- Mickey, come here.
- Me?
Yeah, you. Come here.
- You got that picture with you?
- Picture? Sure, sure.
Sure, I've got my picture.
That's me. That's my picture.
- Remember? Mickey Miller, that's me.
- Very nice, very nice.
- Thanks very much.
- That's all right. A good picture, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- I can get in shape again. I can fight.
There you are. Mickey
Miller, before and after.
You were right. One chance in a million.
One guy makes the grade. The rest fall like flies in winter.
A million to one odds? That's pretty heavy.
I think I'll stick to driving a truck. How about some soap, Mutt?
Listen. Let me know when you change your mind.
- My office hours are noon till midnight.
- Thanks very much.
Don't be mad if I don't show up. How about that soap?
- Good music, huh?
- It's beautiful.
I've always wanted to come here. You like it, don't you?
- Sure.
- Danny, why don't you dance faster?
- You won't have to do any road work.
- How we doing?
She's doing all right, but you're better in the ring.
Danny. I ought to congratulate you on the fight. I forgot.
- The fight? Sure, the fight.
- It must have been thrilling.
All the lights and thousands of people.
I was so excited, I could hardly talk.
Yeah, I couldn't hear you.
Murray, I'm awfully sorry about the contest last week...
...but I just couldn't get out of bed, I was so sick.
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, you know.
- You know I wouldn't let you down.
- Let's dance, Lilly.
Gee, I'd love to. Thanks.
Murray, if you'll let me dance the contest with you tonight...
...you won't be sorry, I promise.
Just give me this one last chance. Won't you, Murray?
- All right, break it up.
- It's all right. She's my girl. We're together.
Don't be so much together.
Oh, how's this?
- Happy?
- Oh, yes. Of course.
Better watch your step, big shot.
That boy with her is Young Samson.
Who's the dame? You know her?
I met them one night at the dance at the Forsyth.
Say, the kid's got something.
I think I'll try her out.
- It's hot.
- Sit down, have a gin freezola and cool off.
Peggy, your dancing was awful swell.
She beat everybody else in the hall.
Hello, Peggy. I saw you dancing by.
I'd like to introduce Mr. Murray
Burns. Peggy Nash and Danny Kenny.
- I'm pleased to meet you, Mr. Burns.
- Likewise.
I guess you boys have heard about each other.
- Murray's the best this side of 14th St.
- The other side too.
Yes, I know. I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Burns.
Thanks. Say, how about this dance? I guess you could follow me all right, huh?
- Do you mind, Danny?
- No, go ahead. Enjoy yourself.
Don't worry. I'll see she does.
Thanks, Danny. Just this dance.
If you fellas don't mind,
I'll sit this dance out.
Sure. Sit down. That's a chair.
I certainly can use it. Murray just about danced my feet off.
Here. Knock yourself out.
I don't mind saying, kid, you're a natural. You sure can spiel.
Believe me, I've tripped the light fantastic with the best.
Thank you, Mr. Burns. I'm nervous now.
- I've never before had a partner like you.
- Sure, but that's okay.
You'll get over that nervous feeling.
That's the idea. You'll follow me like a ghost, kid.
And now, folks, for the regular Rose Garden contest.
To the winners, this beautiful silver loving
- cup.
The judges will conduct eliminations from the bandstand. Please come up.
Will all the palookas and clucks...
...kindly save their shoe leather and our time by sitting this one out? Let's go.
How about it? Wanna try? We'll show them some real stepping.
That'd be wonderful, but
I ought to ask Danny first.
What's that mug got, a mortgage on you?
Just relax, kid, and that cup's in the bag.
- Thanks.
- Looks like that snake's got a monopoly.
- You gonna let him get away with it?
- She's having a good time.
- I don't worry about Peggy.
- You ain't never worry.
Like with MacPherson. You could be champion, only you don't wanna.
- Just to show me.
- I got nothing else to do.
Listen, we're gonna cop this cup, now, see?
We'll shake these clucks off on the next number.
- We're dancing alone.
- We've won?
Sure, what'd I tell you? Now we'll give them some fancy stuff.
- Who's the dame?
- I don't know.
- Some newcomer.
- Not bad.
You got the class, kid.
You got what it takes.
- Do you mean it, Mr. Burns?
- Sure.
And I'm the guy that knows how to bring it out.
Gee, Danny, ain't she great?
I'm certainly proud of her.
I guess I'd better be going.
Murray doesn't like me to sit out dances with strange men.
- Scram then.
- Danny, look.
- You were great.
- Isn't it beautiful?
Are you sure you want me to keep this?
I got a flock of them, one every other night.
Last weekend in a tournament at Hunts Point Casino.
- I danced that one with Murray.
- Yeah? I thought he danced it alone.
I don't believe I can eat any of this. I'm too excited.
Danny, Mr. Burns told me that
I could be a professional.
No reason why not.
With a little training, I might be able to break her in, after I polish the rough spots.
She didn't do so bad just now.
Wouldn't you like to join the table?
Well, it ain't exactly my kind of crowd, baby.
Yeah? Too much of a crowd, see?
Mutt. Don't let him talk to Mr. Burns like that.
Don't worry, I was going anyway.
Any time you want to drop these mugs, slip over. I'll give you another spiel.
I don't mind you dancing with my girl. I don't like those cracks.
- Your girl? You let me dance with her?
- Yeah.
That's right. You wanna make something out of it?
What's going on here? Are you having some trouble, Murray?
- I stepped on some personal property here...
- You stepped on something.
Danny, stop!
- Hey, cut it out.
- Yeah, this place respectable joint.
- Beat it, Danny. Beat it.
- Come on, Peggy. Let's get out of here.
Stand back, everybody. That was an accident.
Stand back, now. Come on, Peggy. Get out.
It was an accident, everybody. An accident.
I hope you ain't sore.
I didn't mind you dancing, but he tried to make you look like two cents.
I guess he was pretty fresh.
But, Danny, the cup, it's all broken.
- Mutt figured it was your cup or my bean.
- I had a swell time anyway.
- You ain't sore at me, huh?
- Of course not, Danny.
That's better. I'll see you tomorrow.
Hello. Hotel Halifax?
Mr. Murray Burns, please.
Hello, Mr. Burns? Peggy Nash.
No, no, I didn't lose your number. I kept it in my purse.
I just wanted to tell you
I'm sorry for what happened.
I hope you weren't hurt.
Tomorrow night? Why, yes, I think I could.
The Irving Place Casino, 10:30. All right.
For crying out loud, Danny, take it easy.
- Kenny, you're 20 minutes late.
- So what?
- You're holding up the works.
- Sue me.
- Okay, Kenny. I'll talk to you later.
- We'll make it up next trip.
You know us. I don't know, Danny.
I don't know what's the matter with you lately. You're so nervous.
If I sound nervous, I'm nervous.
All right. Peggy stands you up and I get the grief of it.
What do you take it for? I wouldn't take it from the Queen of Sheba.
You'd take it and like it.
Hey, fellas, do a hurry-up job, will you? We're 25 minutes late.
Hurry it up, will you, guys? Be good guys.
- Hey, wise guy. You almost scraped me.
- Cool off, fella.
- Danny.
- Mutt, look who's here. Googi.
Gee, and if it ain't the old mutt face. How are you?
- Hello.
- It's been a long time.
- It's been a long time.
- How you doing?
- I just checked in.
- You been away someplace?
Yeah, I been a lot of places and no place.
Tell you the truth, Danny,
I've been sightseeing.
I spent a year and a day on that sweet little island they call Blackwells.
Then I took a little trip up the Hudson too.
There's a beautiful view up there.
I ought to know. I looked at it for 36 months.
- I heard you were doing a stretch.
- I had it coming to me.
I was playing for peanuts.
But from now on I play for high stakes and with nothing in my pocket either, see?
And I'll chop off the hand of the first guy that tries to stop me.
Hey, look, Danny. Gee, I hate to ask this, but could you stake me?
I could use a shave and a haircut and a pair of shoes with soles on them.
I'll give you a stake. French fried potatoes too. Come on, get in.
Get in that limousine, Googi. Okay, fellas?
- Okay!
- Give her the gas, Danny. Let her go.
Gee, it's good to see you guys.
What a break bumping into you.
It's funny, Danny, the old bunch, every one of them.
They keep turning up like bad pennies. First Pete, now Googi.
The other day, I heard that Mushy
Kelly finished his stretch for burglary.
What a bunch.
It must be pretty late.
You gotta get some sleep.
No, that's all right.
Keep on playing, will you?
Play that part you just played.
What? This?
Now I know something's wrong. Who is it, Peggy?
I thought so.
Peggy's old lady nailed me on the stairs tonight and lit into me like a bantam.
Where was Peggy, and what did I mean keeping her out all night?
- Your fault, huh?
- Yeah, how do you like that?
Peggy chasing around with that sharpie from 65th Street...
...and I gotta take the schlack.
Danny. You're still pretty set on that kid, aren't you?
You ought to know. She's part of me by now. Like my right arm.
Everything was going good until that sharpie came...
...and gave her a fancy line of gab.
Danny, I don't know this guy
Burns, but I think I know the type.
And he's not the one to worry about.
You got a lot more competition than that spieler.
What do you mean? I don't get you, Ed.
Danny, I know Peggy, and I certainly know you.
I can't exactly explain this to you...
...but call it applause, ambition, call it what you like.
But it'd take a lot more than a man to come between you two.
You see, when she rubs her eyes open in the morning...
...she sees her name up in bright lights: "Peggy Nash, dancer."
All day long, keeps moving those lights around different theaters, different cities.
At night, she goes to sleep with applause in her ears.
Danny, she can't see you and she can't hear you...
...because she's blinded by those lights and deafened by that applause.
It looks like you nailed it, Ed.
But whatever it is, I'm not gonna let it take her away from me.
Come in.
I waited downstairs since 10:00.
You didn't show up. I thought
I'd see what was the matter.
What are you trying to pull on me?
Why, I thought we had a date for today.
- It's Sunday, isn't it? - So you're getting big-hearted, huh?
Why, don't you want to, Danny? Or are you trying to give me a stand up?
Stand up? That's what I've been getting since that creepy cake-eater horned in.
- You got soap in your ears.
- So I got soap in my ears.
- You needn't yell.
- Who's yelling?
Not me.
- What are you trying to do, cut my throat?
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
- You didn't mean it.
- Here, let me wash it.
Honestly, I was only fooling.
- First you cut me, then say "only fooling."
- You got a right to be sore.
I thought since it was
Sunday and so nice and warm...
...maybe you'd take me to the beach.
We could have the day together.
- Why didn't you say so?
- You jumped down my throat.
- You know what I ought to do to you?
- What?
I certainly missed you, Peggy.
We had a swell time last week and the week before.
We won't have a swell time today unless we get started, so...
You know, Danny, someday I'd love to take a long ocean trip.
We could do that on our honeymoon. We could take a cruise to Atlantic City.
I think I can get my boss to give me a week off.
No, I mean far away. Europe, South America.
Traveling on big ships, seeing the world from a front seat.
Danny, if I'm successful, I can go anywhere.
Get off that express and take a local.
- Still dreaming about being a star, huh?
- Why not?
Danny, I just know I could be a great dancer.
Maybe even up there someday, up on Broadway, in a big show.
- My name in bright lights.
- What do you want that for?
We could be happy together without all that noise.
- Together?
- Yeah, sure. Married. Why not?
Well, I wasn't exactly thinking about that yet.
- No?
- Don't you see, Danny?
We're hurting each other if we let ourselves into the lives our families had.
Always struggling, trying to make a dime do for a dollar. I want out of Forsyth Street.
We don't have to live down there.
We can move up to the Bronx.
Danny, sometimes I don't understand you.
Everybody in New York wants to do something, be somebody, except you.
- I just wanna be happy.
- But you've got to have ambition.
You can't drag around this town on one foot.
You've got to run like the rest, or you'll be left behind.
I didn't know you wanted me to, Peggy.
I'd do anything if you'd tell me you wanted me to.
Danny, I guess we want different things.
Yeah, maybe you're right.
I'll tell you what. We go over to Chinatown, have some chop suey.
Then we go over to
Settlement and have a dance.
I'd love to, but, well, I wanted to tell you this before, only I didn't know how.
You see, I can't tonight.
I promised to go to Palace Gardens.
There's a contest there, a big city contest.
There's going to be a booking agent. Maybe I can get a job.
Yeah, I guess we are talking about different things.
That sharpshooter gonna be there?
Oh, I don't know, Danny.
I don't care about him.
- We'd better go.
- Look, Peggy.
Suppose I do stop dragging one foot?
Suppose I do join up with the pack and run with them?
I can do something besides juggling a packing case.
I got two fists to beat the way for both of us.
All you gotta do is say the word and I'll get going.
But, Danny, I don't want you to do it for me.
I want you to be somebody for yourself.
All right. Any way you want it, Peggy.
But tell me one thing so I won't always be worrying about you.
Promise me that you'll always be my girl, no matter what.
I promise, Danny.
Always. No matter what.
Okay, but do I have to start the show?
The house is as cold as a corpse. They'll freeze us.
Can't you make it three or four?
Wait a minute. You're breaking in. You can't pick your spots now.
I might fix it for you so you'd have number two. That's all.
- All right, skip it. What's the route?
- We open in Baltimore...
...play the last half in Philly, jump to Akron, lay off last half, play Cleveland a week...
...pick up the Delahanty time in
Buffalo, finish that, then Brooklyn.
You call that a route. If you can't do...
Listen. The woods are full of dancers who'd break their neck for a booking.
- Well, if you don't like it...
- Okay, okay. Sold.
That's the way. You got nothing to worry about.
All you gotta do is knock them dead.
What about the billing? Burns and Nash?
- You bill it Burns and Company.
- What about the 80 bucks?
- Make it payable to me.
- Okay with you, Peggy?
Of course. I leave everything to Murray.
Blank check, huh? Well, it's okay by me.
You'll have to sign too,
Peggy, by this cross.
Gee, this is the first time
I ever signed a contract.
I'm so nervous I can hardly write.
Attagirl.
Don't forget, you leave Thursday.
Train pulls out for Baltimore at
8:15. Grand Central. Don't be late.
I'll have two tickets for you on Wednesday.
Goodbye and lots of luck.
You'll need it in Akron.
- You said it. See you Wednesday.
- Okay.
How'd you like it, baby?
Boy, oh, boy. Am I dreaming, or am I dreaming?
What did I tell you? Did
I sell him a bill of goods.
I can't believe it. I won't believe it until we really open.
Don't worry about that. It's a cinch.
I know I can get a gown at Klein's...
...but I should have a real pair of dance slippers.
Murray, I'll be able to send Ma a few dollars every week, won't I?
That'll be all right, won't it?
Sure, baby, sure. Everything's gonna be all right with us from now on.
It's getting late. I'd better go.
I want my shoe, Murray.
Please let me go, Murray. My shoe.
Don't worry about that.
Please let me go, Murray. Murray, please let me go. Please let me go. Let me go!
You may come in now, Mr. Kenny.
Remember what you said. I'm depending on you.
- Don't worry.
- I won't. I got my fingers crossed.
Hello, Kenny.
Took you a long time. I was expecting you.
- Got an empty stall in your stable?
- Is it money or a dame?
Both. Now look, Scotty, I don't wanna waste your time or my own.
I'll take a few fights.
I've gotta get real dough.
I think you've got the wrong number.
I don't know what reasons you've got.
I've only got one. I want a champion. So get this straight.
If you're gonna fight for me, you're gonna fight my way.
All right. When do I start?
As soon as we get you in shape.
Right now, you're all musclebound.
We'll start working out those truck-driver's bumps.
In the meantime, I'll line up an out-of-town card for you.
There's another thing you might as well know now.
You'll get no setups. If my boys haven't got what it takes, I'm just not interested.
- I don't want any setups, Scotty.
- Well, that's fine. Now let me see.
You can open in Detroit and then
I'll run you up into Cleveland...
...and then we'll go to Toledo.
That ought to get us Chicago.
Scotty, I was wondering there might be a bout in Pittsburgh about Christmas.
What's in Pittsburgh? Who is she?
Now, the way I understand it, you take care of business.
All I asked was, could you arrange Pittsburgh?
All right, I'll see if I can.
- By the way, do you need any money?
- Not yet.
All right, I'll see you at Stillwell's to see what shape you're in.
- Remind me to pick a second.
- You got one here. Can't shake him.
I'll second him. I'll even third him. Let me tell you, I can...
Tell it to him.
- No kidding. Is it all set?
- Yeah. You can relax.
Danny, Danny, you can't imagine what you've done for my career.
Yes, Mr. MacPherson?
We're lining up an out-of-town card on Young Samson.
But remember, no fights near
Pittsburgh. That's one town we detour.
- It's a massacre.
- Looks like you guessed it right.
I always guess it right. I never have to look no more.
I can it tell from the yelling.
That was the blood yell.
It's a cold pack! He's in the canvas.
It's over. Give me that four bits.
- Who won?
- I never know till they come through.
I can tell you who won.
- Yeah? Who?
- Young Samson.
- He's got to win.
- Why?
Because he doesn't care whether he wins or not.
You mean...
...if he wanted to win, he'd lose?
- Maybe.
What did I tell you?
And I knew because I got clothes on my back.
What's the secret behind that sleep-making left-right? Those curls, maybe?
Danny, watch out for a gal named Delilah.
Are you in shape. You sure put that guy away.
- Yeah, don't take a haircut.
- Put your hand in there.
- It's cold.
- Not half as cold as Hanson is right now.
- You said it.
- How about another?
What's the matter with you guys? Go on. Get out.
All right, fellas. Let him get his clothes on. I'll give you all the smoke-up stuff later.
- Get up to my office.
- Danny, it was terrific.
- He didn't even hit you once.
- See that?
What's the matter?
Nothing. He sprained his thumb.
I put the wrong hand in the ice water.
- Danny, someone here to see you.
- Who is it?
Remember me? This is Googi under these duds.
Well, Googi. Where did you come from?
The same place you come from, Forsyth and Delancey.
- How are you?
- Well, get Googi.
Hundred-and-fifty-dollar suit, monogrammed shirt and buttons good enough to eat.
- Kid, you look like a success.
- You're not doing bad.
As a matter of fact, I won on you. I brought you a present.
- I want you to meet some pals. Let them in.
- Hey, girls.
Come on in, girls. This is Sally, Irene and Mary.
Come right down out of the scandals just to see you fight.
You were wonderful. You stopped the show cold.
He sure did and he won me ten grand too.
Now, look, Danny. I got a big blowout waiting for you. Everybody's invited.
- You're full of surprises.
- There's a big party arranged.
- Come on. Get dressed. Let's all go.
- Sure.
Okay, now.
We got a real snappy treat here.
I want you all to meet Samson's kid brother, a great musician, Eddie Kenny.
He's gonna give us some real classy music, so I want a little quiet, see?
Come on, Danny let's have him.
Come on, Eddie boy, give.
- Gee, Danny, this is no time, no...
- They'll love it. Play the part I like.
All right.
If you ask me, this stuff is too ritzy.
What happened to Dorothy?
She's so dumb, she didn't even know what he was talking about.
Hello, Max. Where you been?
Wouldn't you like to know, huh?
Where's Danny? Oh, there he is.
Samson, that fight was a real honey.
I collected two grand on you tonight.
Max, this is Danny's kid brother,
Eddie, a composer of real class.
Eddie, meet the biggest producer on Broadway, Max Leonard in person.
How are you, young fella?
Say, Danny, is that true?
That Cannonball Wales is hiding out from you?
Say, where's that gossip hound Mulligan?
He's got me stepping out with Cutie d'Amour...
...breaking up my home life.
I think we'll find him right there in the corner.
Don't worry, kid. They just like to hear themselves talk.
I knew they wouldn't listen.
I could've told you that.
We don't care. We'll show them.
I'll show them right now.
Hey, Max. Listen to that swing.
That kid's got something new.
Say, that's not so bad.
Danny, if he can give me a score for my next show, he can write his own ticket.
Say, Eddie sure can swing it, can't he?
Hey, what about some caviar? Come on. Just try.
Chef, fix him up a nice plate.
Caviar. Remember what we used to do for a frankfurter and a swig of lemonade?
I never forget that. Hey, listen, what's new about Peggy? You seen her lately?
- No.
- I heard she's dancing in vaudeville.
- I know she's doing a lot of traveling.
- Yeah?
Hey, boss, them show cuties just blew in. They wanna...
- Okay, I'll be right over.
- All right.
Sorry, Danny. I'll see you later.
Next time on that waltz, don't lean all over me.
Don't get up out of your curtsy till I bow.
- Remember that, Pavlova.
- All right, I'll remember.
- Just a minute.
- Say, if that's Art Baron, tell him to wait.
How long does he think that club deal is gonna hang?
All right, I'll tell him. Just a second, Art.
- Danny.
- Hello, Peggy.
Oh, Danny!
Come in and let's look at you.
Gee, I didn't know you were in town.
- It's good to see you.
- It's good to see you, Danny.
What's all the noise? Who you got there?
Oh, it's just a friend, Murray.
Oh, just a friend.
Excuse me for butting in.
- Danny, you remember my partner, Murray.
- Yeah.
So how's the little champ?
- Peggy, I'd like to talk to you alone.
- Giving me the brushoff, huh?
- Danny, I've read about you in the paper.
- I've been keeping track of you too.
I've seen your bill in the Variety.
What are you doing here? This ain't no third-rate gym for palookas.
- You're asking for it, Burns.
- Come on, sock me.
- That's the only thing you got any head for.
- Murray, Danny and I are old friends.
All right. I'll let you make a date with your old friend, sure. Next year.
I'll see Peggy now or any time I wanna, see?
- Get wise to yourself. Three's a crowd.
- You can't talk to Danny like that.
Since when you giving orders?
Shut your trap or I'll...
- Strong arm stuff, huh?
- Sorry, Peggy. Did I hurt you?
You probably broke her shoulder.
- Get that mug out of here.
- Peggy.
No. It doesn't matter. Please leave me alone. Why'd you have to come here?
Because I was crazy to see you. I wouldn't hurt you. I'd cut my arm off first.
Danny, don't talk like that.
I can't see you. You've got to go. Don't you see, you've gotta leave me alone.
You heard what she said. Scram.
Now you see what happens when you give a mug like that a break.
You should have thrown him out the minute he opened the door.
I don't mind telling you, baby, that means a lot, you standing up for me.
- Let's see what that gorilla did to you.
- Keep your hands off me.
- Why, what's the matter? Come on.
- Just remember that.
Don't ever put your hands on me again.
Get out of here. This is my dressing room.
Okay. But you keep your mind on your routine or I'll find me somebody who will.
Danny! Danny, wait.
- I wanna talk to you. Give me a chance.
- Yeah, sure, Peggy, sure.
Danny, I didn't wanna be mean. Please understand.
I was afraid they'd cancel if you cut his face. I know you had a right to hit him.
- You even had a...
- That's all right. Don't worry.
Does your shoulder still hurt?
You sure?
You should've let that guy take it. He had it coming.
- You sure it don't hurt?
- No.
I know I've hurt you worse than that.
You know, I meant to write you many times. I was scared you'd be angry.
I couldn't be sore at you, Peggy. I certainly missed you every minute you was away.
You know, you haven't changed a bit.
- I haven't?
- No.
- Are you sure, Danny?
- You're still the same little Peggy.
- Still my girl, ain't you?
- Yes, Danny. Always.
Oh, I love you so much.
Hey, what is this?
Come on, break it up. Hire a hall. What do you think this is?
- You wanna make something out of it?
- Go on. Get out.
- How long you gonna be in town?
- Till tomorrow.
- Only tomorrow?
- Then Hartford and Providence.
And after that?
That's the end of the contract. After that...
After that I'll be free again.
Does that mean you're not gonna leave anymore?
If that's what you want, Danny.
- You mean that, Peg?
- Yes, Danny.
- For sure?
- For sure.
- For keeps?
- For keeps.
Well. Two weeks. Why, that's nothing. That's nothing at all.
That'll just give me time to get everything ready.
- You know, Peg...
- Yes, Danny?
Well, what do you know about that?
Hey, didn't I just tell...?
Holy smokes. Some people in this town is just plain nuts.
Here you are, Manchester Hotel.
Wait here a few minutes, will you, bub?
- Then it's a date for tomorrow?
- Paddy's Tavern. I'll meet you there.
I want you to meet Scotty and Mutt too. He's gonna fall all over himself.
- After that, what do you wanna do?
- I don't care, as long as we're together.
We'll go and visit the East Side. We'll go to Moscowitz's Romanian restaurant.
After that, we'll go to
Forsyth Street Settlement.
- There's always something there.
- That'd be wonderful.
Danny, I'm so happy.
It's just like running through a dark alley...
...and suddenly finding your way out in warm sunlight.
Come on, come on. You gotta get some shuteye. On your feet.
You can't do your kind of work with only eight hours sleep.
- Still looking after me, aren't you?
- Right.
I started a long time ago. Can't quit now.
It's awfully nice to find somebody you can depend on.
That's what I'm here for. Any trouble, I'll be standing by.
Now, go on, get to bed.
- See you tomorrow, huh?
- Yeah.
I'm not trying to butt in, but you're acting like a kid with his first crush.
You guessed it, jockey. She is.
- Good night, Miss Nash.
- Good night.
So you showed up, huh? I thought you took a powder for good.
- What are you doing?
- Since when are you asking...?
Murray, haven't I got enough headaches?
- What's the trouble?
- There's no trouble. You're in.
I've landed you in the circuit. Read it and collapse.
Club Madrid, Chicago, Club Paree, Philly...
...the Deauville, St. Louis,
Paradise, Casablanca, Ritz Roof.
Ain't that sweet music, baby?
The big time, the big money.
Well, when does all this...?
- AI, have you really got that?
- I've got it in the bag and sewed up.
Eight-fifty a week, 40 weeks.
Start in Chicago in two weeks.
We've got to do some tussling in them two weeks to get those routines down.
Got your tongue tied? You leave it to Al.
- I told you I'd put you on top.
- Top or no, we've gotta buckle down.
I've got a slant for a new kind of number.
But, Al. Al, I thought maybe after these next two weeks I'd take a little vacation.
- A vacation at $850 a week? Are you nuts?
- We start off with eight bars of bolero.
Then the spins we did in the tango.
It's something you've never seen.
- That's what they want.
- Then do an open step.
From that, slip into the rumba.
Al, get busy on that music. Don't hold me up.
Now, how about a flashy name?
How about Maurice and Margalo?
That's your new billing. You like it?
Maurice and Margalo: Club Madrid.
Maurice and Margalo?
Yeah. Margalo spelled right out in lights.
"Maurice and Margalo."
You know who just went in? Danny Kenny.
- Young Samson.
- No kidding?
Let's go around the back. We can see better.
Okay, come on. Let's go.
Wasn't that Danny Kenny that came in?
Yeah. Young Samson. They always come back.
- Say, you better go tip off Walter.
- Okay.
There he is, Young Samson.
What did I tell you?
What do you say, Peg? How about a dance?
Later, Danny. Let's watch a while.
- Anything you say. This is your night.
- No, Danny. It's your night.
Well, then let's say it's our night.
Attention, please! Attention!
We've got with us tonight...
...one of our own Forsyth boys...
...who has socked his way right up from Essex Street to Essex House.
I mean, the next welterweight champion of the world, Danny Kenny.
It looks like orchids for Danny and Peggy.
I'll be back in a flash with a flash.
- Did you tell him, Danny?
- I didn't say a word.
- How'd they find out then?
- I guess we just look that way.
Okay, you truckers and shaggers, on with the jitters, and let joy be unrefined.
Now, come on, let's see some real stepping.
Danny and Peggy are elected honorary judges.
Let's go!
Boy, keep it hot!
- Happy, Danny?
- Very.
It's a real celebration, ain't it?
And now, by special request, folks, a little number by the judges themselves.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I don't know about dancing. Ask the champ.
Come on, Peggy, be a sport.
- All right, but Danny's got to do it with me.
- Come on, Dan.
- Can't refuse a lady.
- Attaboy.
- Go on, do this by yourself.
- No, I'd much rather not.
Go on, you're among friends. Give them a treat.
- Good evening. What train, sir?
- 11:15, Hartford.
Track 14. Would you like your luggage in the car with you?
Yes, thanks. Danny, please don't see me down to the train.
- He'll be there and it'll cause...
- All right.
Well, it's two weeks from tonight?
- You're gonna wire me which train to meet?
- Yes. Yes, Danny, I'll wire you.
Tell me, were you really happy tonight?
The biggest day of my whole life. Don't I look it?
Hold me close.
Train would be leaving.
- What are you bawling about?
- It's just that I don't want it to end.
There's gonna be lots more.
This way, please.
Good afternoon. I represent the Bluepoint Vacuum Cleaner.
- Sorry.
- lf you let me demonstrate, you'll say...
..."I don't see how I got along without it."
- Hello. Got a telegram for me?
- No. Look, we're bachelors...
- Not for long.
What are you selling? Vacuum cleaners?
Come on in. We can use one of those.
- Looks like a sale.
- Thanks.
Waited for two hours to get a license.
Looks like everybody's getting married.
- You getting married?
- You said it.
Your wife will appreciate the Bluepoint.
Now, allow me to demonstrate its efficiency.
- Go right ahead, son.
- Thanks.
So I gets to the window and I discover there's a new law in New York.
- You gotta wait three days to get married.
- As you see...
...you can protect and clean the most expensive rugs with no effort.
Are you sure there was no wire?
Nope, only some mail and photos to autograph there.
You'll find that our cleaner sucks up every bit of grit and dirt...
...and adds years of wear and life to your rug.
And preserves the sanitation of your home.
What's the matter with you?
Here's a letter from Peggy.
I didn't look for a letter.
You asked if there's a wire.
Now, for your upholsteries, drapes, curtains or hanging...
...you simply attach this gadget.
It's simple. A child can operate it.
You attach this end, push this button and...
- Say, Pinky. Danny's here.
- Hey, you're late.
Where you been? Scotty's been raising the deuce.
We're waiting an hour already.
- What's the matter? Can't you talk?
- Pipe down, Pinky. Pipe down.
- You're in his hair.
- Another prima donna.
You can't say nothing around here.
Okay, Sailor, hop in for a couple rounds. Guy's getting hard to handle.
Danny just blew in. I don't know what's the matter.
- Where is he?
- He's in the ring.
- Hi, Danny. Hi, Mutt.
- Hi, Sailor.
You sure look in the pink.
Did you see the Telegram?
- Boy, Sullivan sure went to town on you.
- Let's get started.
Why, what's the matter,
Danny? What are you sore about?
Sure, I know Cannonball. I don't trust him. He's mean and dangerous.
- Danny'll stop him.
- He might stop Danny.
- I'm taking no chances.
- Danny will throw a right in his breadbasket.
By the time he pulls his glove out, he'll be champ. Look at him.
Danny, wait a minute, will you?
- This ain't for keeps.
- Come on, stop crying.
Say, what's going on there?
Just a second, Danny, will you?
- Say, Mutt. Call him off me, will you?
- Take it easy, Danny. Take it easy.
What do you want him to do, break his hands?
What are you slugging him for? What is the idea?
- I'm sorry, Sailor. You all right?
- Sure, sure, it's okay.
- I'm sorry. I didn't know what I was doing.
- All right, get yourself a shower.
Wait. What's going on? Spill it.
I don't know. Honest I don't.
He just come in like that, sore, like somebody crossed him.
You mean double-crossed him.
And I think I can name her.
All right, what's use eating your heart out? That won't bring her back.
I know something about human nature, including women.
You've got to pull yourself together.
Once you got the crown, you'll find that gal on your doorstep.
They all like the limelight.
Peggy ain't different.
Once you're on top, she'll die to be with you.
Look, I can book the southpaw.
Then later, Cannonball Wales.
- How about Cannonball now?
- He's too tough.
You're not ready for him. Look.
- First the southpaw, then later...
- Quit stalling me, Scotty.
You said the crown would mean something.
Well, get me Wales. I can whip him.
Sure, Scotty. Danny'll bring that Cannonball down to buckshot.
- Get the match and I'll bet 50 grand on him.
- What will Danny get?
Wales' manager's cagey. We get peanuts.
So? Once we get the crown, we get cagey.
Till then, you can call me banker.
Sure, go ahead, Scotty, do it!
All right, you've got the match.
That's a good fella.
We can beat him. We can beat him, Danny.
Samson battles Wales for welterweight crown tonight!
Read all about the New York fight!
Samson battles Wales for welterweight crown tonight.
Come in.
Miss Margalo, Mr. Maurice, on stage, please.
Yes, yes, coming.
... one of the toughest to out-punch.
It is said Samson packs a terrific right.
If Wales isn't on the watch, Samson may floor him.
If you don't mind my saying,
Samson's gotta put up a fight to win.
- Yes, yes, I suppose so.
- He better. I bet two bucks on him.
Will you stop bothering about that radio?
I'm ready, Murray.
- You mind if we use your radio, Peggy?
- Of course not. Go ahead.
- Thanks, Peggy.
- Oh, thanks a lot.
Murray, let's hurry our first number. I want to listen in.
What for? That palooka of yours won't last two rounds anyway.
Danny, this fellow Wales is bad. Don't fall for his fight.
He knows tricks. Watch when he backs into the ropes.
I'll watch, don't worry.
Look, when he acts groggy, that's just a pose.
I got it down. I always fight the way you tell me. Quit worrying.
You always tell me that and do the same thing.
- All right, kid. Go in there and beat him.
- All right.
- Good luck to you, Mutt.
- Thanks, Danny.
Scotty.
It's a funny thing, Mutt.
Here I am, fighting for the championship of the world, and didn't wanna be a fighter.
This is Sam Hayes, all set to give a description of this widely publicized fight.
Both fighters have entered the ring, the referee is giving them instructions.
There's the warning whistle. In just a moment, the fight will be on.
- Has it started?
- You're in time. It's the first round.
That's the bell. The fight's on. They start sparring.
Samson leads his left to Wales' nose. So fast you can just see it.
Wales rips a right jab for the face but misses.
- Danny's in fine shape, isn't he?
- Sure is.
Hey, Dutch, don't forget that big blowout I'm giving later to celebrate.
I got the whole club reserved for all my friendly enemies.
How you gonna pay the bill after you get through paying me off?
You look fine. Settle down.
- One...
- Come on, Walesie!
...three, four, five...
- Take a count.
...seven.
- Close in on him. Tie him in knots.
- This guy ain't so easy. He hits like a mule.
Dutch, what do you say instead of cash...
...you give me 50 percent of your uptown take?
Now, don't forget, close in on him.
Steady, Danny, steady.
Come on, Danny. Keep it in there.
See that? See that foul?
That dirty heel, Wales.
You can take it easy, brother.
That don't worry Young Samson.
Fouls ain't nothing to him. This is a cinch.
- Champion!
- Three...
...four, five...
- Stay down!...six...
- Stay down!...seven, eight!
- The last count sure helped.
- You need it.
Hey, what's your hurry? Take your time. You got plenty of time.
That's right. Get cagey, like we talked about.
- We gotta work fast.
- What do you want me to do?
What do I want you to do?
Here, let me fix your gloves.
If they can't see you, they can't hit you.
He'll try for a knockout. Don't clinch.
Keep him off with your left lead.
Just keep jabbing at his lamps.
Give it to him!
Danny! Cover.
Watch it, Danny. Watch.
Now, keep them up. Keep...
Cover up!
- Come on, Walesie!
- Danny, watch his left! Box him!
- What's the matter? He don't listen.
- Danny oughtn't lead him around the eyes.
- Box him, Danny!
- Come on, Danny! Like we talked about!
Referee, can't you see he's fouling my man? Watch your eyes, Danny! Your eyes!
This is a great comeback Wales is making.
Wales keeps stabbing Samson's face, one, two, one, two.
Samson seems a little confused.
Wales now leads quick rights to Samson's face.
He left himself open for that.
Danny caught him a hard right, but he came back with two jabs...
...to Danny's other eye.
That right one is bad enough.
Danny's trying too hard. He ought to watch that left on his eye.
Yeah, it's red and swollen.
You can see it from here.
Can't you hear the bell?
What's the matter, thumb in the eye?
- Both eyes.
- Both eyes.
Why don't you listen? I told you to watch his left.
That's what I been doing but he stuck his thumb in my eye.
- I can hardly see him.
- Crowd your man and fight to the body.
Now, come on. Fight to the body now.
- You're looking fine.
- Come on, boy.
Keep belting him right in the body, Danny, all the time.
Watch it, Danny.
Come on.
Both of Samson's eyes are nearly closed.
Wales throws caution to the winds, and punches the body and the head.
Come on, Danny. Come on!
Come on, hit him, Danny. Come on, Danny.
Danny, come on!
...three, four, five, six, seven.
- Danny, get up!
Come on, Danny!
- How are your eyes?
- I can hardly see him.
You can't see? Do you want to stop?
No. They're coming along. They're clearing up. Keep throwing water on them.
- Is he hurting you much?
- He can't.
Danny, keep circling and keep your guard up. All right?
All right, I'll nail him.
What's the matter, Googi?
Looking for a miracle?
Keep your guard up now. Your guard up, Danny.
Samson misses with a wild swing.
Danny's eyes are almost closed.
How he stands up to this this torture is a miracle of will and courage.
Wales tears in with a hard left.
Don't let him get you up against the ropes. Come on, get away from them ropes!
Three, four, five...
...six, seven.
- How's that feel?
- That's good, Mutt.
- I can see better already.
- Danny, I'm gonna stop the fight.
- I never should have let you in for this.
- No, Scotty, don't do that to me.
All I need is one shot at this guy. Scotty, promise me something.
Promise you won't throw the towel in. Promise me.
I gotta win. I gotta beat this guy.
All right, Danny, all right.
You'll win. You're gonna beat him. Just keep that guard up.
When you feel him near you, keep pounding the body.
It isn't worth it, Danny.
Scotty, stop it, stop it!
Let me through. He'll murder him. Scotty, you gotta stop it.
Danny. Danny!
Wales comes back with a hard right, right on the button...
...but Samson refuses to go down.
Miraculously on his feet after three rounds of punishment.
His eyes just narrow slits. I doubt if he can see a thing now...
... but he's game as ever, standing right up there.
Wales crowds Kenny, slugging him to the head and face with savage lefts and rights.
Now a stiff right to the heart.
Ain't that too bad. Mind if I listen in?
Not that I wanna hang around you, I just want all the details.
Lock the door, Della.
Yes, ma'am. Excuse me, Mr. Burns.
She'll be ready in a minute.
Okay, but hurry up.
There's the referee trying to talk to him. Samson waves him off.
Referee steps back and
Wales comes charging in.
You can bet the referee wanted to call a technical knockout. Danny wouldn't have it.
Wales jabs three stiff lefts to
Danny's face, looking for an opening...
And there's the final bell.
With this fight over, with Young Samson...
... like his ancient namesake, blind as a bat, but still game...
... a human punching bag, beaten to a pulp...
Miss Peggy, it's time for your next number.
Miss Peggy, you just got to hurry.
Come on, come on, step on it.
You're holding up the works.
Ain't you coming, Miss Peggy?
I can't, Della. I can't.
Well, what will I tell the folks?
What will I tell Mr. Murray?
I don't know. I don't know. Tell him anything you like, but leave me alone.
Just another moment and I'll be all through, Mr. Kenny.
There. Feels better, doesn't it?
Yeah. It don't sting as much now, doc.
Prepare a sedative, please.
- Three grains dissolved in a glass of water.
- Yes, doctor.
This is entirely my fault. I never should have let him in this.
Scotty.
Scotty.
Yes, Danny?
You ain't sore at me, are you?
I did the best I could, but I just couldn't see him.
- Couldn't find him.
- Sure you did, Danny. We know.
Now, take it easy and everything'll be all right.
Excuse me, please.
Now, drink this.
- Is he hurt badly?
- He's taken a lot.
His excellent condition helps.
Look, how about his eyes? Are they okay?
Well, that's of more consequence.
The conjunctival membranes are seriously injured in both eyes.
Some infection has already set in.
I found, too, evidence of gritty substances. Granular material.
- Probably rubbed in every time he was hit.
- Look, doc...
...could it be something like rosin dust?
- Very likely.
I don't know how he ever stood the pain.
If we're to save his sight, I advise getting him to the hospital at once. Excuse me.
Rosin rubbed in his eyes with the tip of their gloves.
The dirty, low-down rats.
Wait a minute, Scotty.
You take care of Danny. That's your job. This is my department.
Please send an ambulance right away.
Connect me with the chief of staff.
Find out where the car is and take care of it like I told you.
Okay, boss. I'll be ready for you.
Say, Dutch, how long will it take to get him in shape?
- About 30 days.
- Dutch.
Relax. Still giving that blowout, Googi?
Sure. The party's still on. Why not? I never welch.
You had tough luck, Googi.
We gave up hope already.
It was one of them surprise comebacks.
- Sure. That happens.
- No hard feelings?
What for, 50 grand?
Listen. I got my limousine downstairs.
What do you say we drive over together?
Just a second. I don't wanna disappoint you, but I'd rather go in my own car.
See, I get kind of nervous driving in strange cars.
Sure. Anything you say. What's the diff?
Come on, boys, let's go. We're wasting time.
Okay, fellas. I'll see you later.
Googi, tell you the truth, if you need the 50 G's bad, I can wait.
Say, a couple of months.
No, I'm paying off. I don't like to have nothing on my mind.
Well, Googi, if it was just between me and you, I'd say call it off.
- But there's Wales. I gotta pay him off.
- Sure. I understand.
Well, that reminds me. I meant to ask
Cannonball for one of his gloves...
...you know, like a souvenir to show around.
Hey, we're going the wrong way.
Archie, where are you heading?
Say, what's the idea?
- Who's that guy?
- Take it easy, Dutch.
Don't get nervous. Happy's a swell driver.
Now, like I was saying, if I had one of Cannonball's gloves...
...I might like to take it to the state boxing commission.
They might like to look it over.
Especially after they get the doctor's report about Samson's eyes.
You're going screwy. What have you been sniffing?
Just a little rosin dust.
- Let me out of here.
- Shut up!
Let that be a lesson to you, Cobb.
When you're carrying a gat on your left side...
...you wanna sit on to the right of the guy you mean to bump off, like I did.
And as for you, you don't have a gat.
I made sure of that with my shoulder.
Look, Googi, it was all his idea.
I was against it. You don't owe me a cent. I'll take care of Wales.
Listen, rat. You and Wales are gonna have to take care of a lot of other things...
...if Danny's lamps go out.
- Stop the car!
Pipe down. Quit yapping.
Now, wait here. Monkey around as though you're fixing the engine.
And no tricks. Do you understand me?
- All right, boss, grab his feet.
- Okay, Hap. Let's make it fast.
- Sure, boss.
- Now, right around this way.
There's no use stripping those labels. They got his mug and prints.
- Okay, boss.
- That reminds me, I better ditch this.
When they fish him up, all we say is:
"He didn't have to go swimming with his hat on."
- Hey, that's a good one, boss.
- Okay, now...
Hey.
Hey, boss, what hap...
Hey, Hap.
Gee, never figured on that at all.
How you think they're gonna be?
You certainly are in a hurry, young fellow. This is only a checkup.
Nurse, you better draw those blinds. The light's too strong.
- Gee, you ought to seen the papers.
- They got Cobb.
No, I mean about the swell notices the fight got.
Best fighter since Bob
Fitzsimmons. That's what they said.
That's fine, Mutt. Thanks.
No kidding. They really went to town about the great fight you put up.
What do you think, doc?
Think they're gonna be all right?
Will I be laid up here long?
Well, it's difficult to say just now. Possibly a few weeks or so.
Nurse, continue with the drops and compresses as ordered.
- I'll see you again tomorrow, son.
- Yeah, sure. Thanks, doc.
You hear that, Eddie?
Three weeks. I'll go daffy in here.
But Danny, you need rest.
You took a lot of punishment.
Yeah, I guess I did. Can't figure out how it happened so quick.
Had him on the run, and all of a sudden the lights went out on me.
Excuse me, doctor. You must do something.
Anything at all. I don't mind the expense, any cost.
It isn't a matter of expense. As I said, it's only a question of time.
Now, perhaps in a year or two we may chance another operation.
A year or two? Why, that means
Danny's finished, he's through.
As a fighter, I'm afraid he is.
He'll be able to see differences of light, and make out shapes and forms.
So that's the sweet wind-up.
That's Danny's finish.
I'm sorry.
Scotty.
Scotty, where's Danny? Is he all right?
- Yes, he's all right.
- Can I see him?
He's in there, isn't he?
He's in there, flat on his back. And you put him there.
Only you, not Cannonball Wales. Danny never would have fought this fight.
He took a worse licking from you than he took from Wales.
I've got to see him. You've got to let me in.
Now, just a minute, Peggy.
I'm gonna tell you something.
I'm not gonna pull punches.
I've seen you give that boy the rawest deal ever and I'm not gonna let you do it again.
I'm not gonna let you go in there and say hello for a while and then break his heart.
No, no, I'm all through with that. Please let me in. I wouldn't do anything to hurt him.
You bet. You've done all you're going to do.
- Scotty, you don't understand.
- You're no good for him...
...and he's no good for you, because...
...well, never mind, he's no good for you.
- Now try to get that through your head.
- Excuse me. Thank you.
Danny's through with you and wants you to stay away from here.
- Nurse?
- Yes?
Who was that, Eddie? Who came in?
Why, just another nurse, Danny.
- I thought maybe it was...
- What?
Oh, nothing. Nothing.
You know... You know, Eddie...
...I can't hardly see you at all.
You're just like kind of a shadow.
Well, the room's pretty dark with the blinds down, Danny.
- Yeah, but you can see me good, can't you?
- Well...
Danny, you'd better put those bandages back.
You know, Ed, I figured that where we came from...
...we were born with our back to the wall...
...and nothing more could happen to us and nobody could hurt us.
Then along comes something like this, and...
Eddie, it's got me scared.
- Really scared.
- What are you talking about, Danny?
Don't be foolish.
Scotty. Scotty, tell him he'll be all right.
- What? Oh, yes.
- Go ahead, Scotty.
Tell him he'll be better.
Why, sure. Sure, Danny, everything'll be all right.
- Look, the doctor says...
- The doctor didn't say nothing.
Just routine talk.
What are you trying to do?
Why don't you tell the truth? I know it and you know it. I'm as blind as a bat.
Take it easy, Danny. Don't lose your head.
This is the first round. You got a long fight in front of you.
Yeah, I know. Left hand out and keep moving.
Great stuff. That's two sure-fire hit numbers so far. We can't miss.
- Terrific. Wait till you hear the second act.
- Eddie, it's swell.
- One thing you've got is rhythm.
- Come on. I've got to see a hundred people.
- I'll telephone you later.
- Okay, fellas.
Goodbye, Eddie. Good luck.
Don't worry, honey. If there's anything to sell, I'll sell it.
- Bye.
- Thanks, bye.
What's the matter, Ed? Ed, anything wrong?
Oh, no, nothing, Danny.
How'd it sound to you? Did you listen?
Oh, all good. Those are really nice tunes.
Nice tunes?
Yeah, it sounded like they ate them up. All sure-fire, every one of them.
Look, Danny. Danny, I want you to tell me the truth.
I want you to tell me what you're really thinking.
Ed, I don't know anything about music. What can I tell you?
Listen, Danny, somehow you do know.
Maybe it's because music is something you feel down deep.
Something you feel as much as I do.
Well, that's all I can do, just tell you what I feel.
I don't know nothing about it.
Ed, do me a favor, will you?
Keep moving around so I can see you better, huh?
Sure, sure, Danny.
Would you like the shade pulled up?
No, no. The lights all right, Ed, thanks. It's okay.
Well, look, kid.
Here's the way I feel about it.
Your business is like any other business.
You either do it or you don't.
You're either a main eventer or a four-round preliminary boy.
Down on Forsyth Street...
...you used to play by the hour, and I'd listen.
You'd tell me about those big shot composers...
...who took it on the chin and went through the mill.
Beethoven, who got the toughest break of all. Lost his hearing.
He didn't quit, he didn't lay down. He just moved in...
...and kept on punching.
- Yes, but then what?
You work, you tear your heart out, and in the end, nobody's interested.
Nobody wants to hear it.
They're only interested after you're dead a hundred years.
Ed, that's an alibi.
That's an alibi used by guys who can't deliver.
But you can do it, and if it's good, they listen. They gotta listen.
Well, maybe you're right.
You know, Danny, you can see things a lot clearer than I can.
I can see things now that
I could never see before.
Come on, kid. Do it for us. Do it for both of us.
You used to talk about the music that you heard in the subway...
...and in the streetcar tracks.
Music in the 101 different languages you heard on all sides.
Music that everybody can hear, all part of one great big song.
Yeah, the song of the city.
The symphony of New York.
The symphony of its seven millions with all its color of a hundred different races.
And the harmony of its thousand discords.
Like the dizzy mad howl of an ambulance...
...screaming across Forsyth and Delancey.
Good evening, Mr. Gaul.
Where could I find Mr. Gaul?
- Right over there.
- Oh, yes. I see. Thank you.
Mr. Gaul, I tried you at the office, but they told me you were here.
- I thought maybe...
- I'm busy. See me later.
How many times have I told you not to dim those foots?
But I've tried to see you all week. You remember me.
Peggy Nash from Burns and Company.
Burns and Company? Yeah, sure.
So, what happened? I thought you were in the big time.
Yes I was. Maurice and Margalo. But I left...
Don't tell me. I know. You got a bum break.
You were good, but the show stunk. So what? So you want a job.
Oh, I'd be so grateful.
Would you? Swell. Maybe my next show.
- Thank you. Thank you.
- That's okay, that's okay.
But, say, you'll have to put on a little weight.
The customers down here don't know from nothing.
Mr. Gaul, I thought maybe I could ask for...
A little advance? Sure.
Step up to the office.
I'll give you five bucks...
- Oh, thanks.
- Don't mention it. Don't mention it.
You won't have to mention that advance, baby. He will soon enough.
Say, looks like you're really gonna need that fin.
No. No, it's just a headache.
Yeah. Strictly from hunger. You're telling me. Here, have a drink.
- Thank you.
- Anybody looking after you, kid?
- No, but...
- I don't care particularly about sharing...
...but maybe you better move in with me.
That's awfully nice of you but l...
I'll do the worrying.
I'll get you an aspirin.
Once I lived a whole week on them.
A lot cheaper than sandwiches.
- Anything new?
- Mr. Kenny is here. He's waiting inside.
Danny?
Hello, Danny.
What are you doing here alone? Trying to get a little whiff of old Broadway?
I came down to hear the traffic.
Don't get much of it uptown.
It's like a graveyard there.
Danny, you didn't have to come downtown. I'd come to your apartment.
No, I wanted to come. Glad for the chance to get out.
There it is. I wouldn't know it was you without that bow tie, Scotty.
Yeah, that's right. Let's sit down, huh?
No, I'd rather move around. Do you mind?
Not at all, Danny. What's on your mind?
I sort of figured you could help me out, Scotty.
Why, Danny, just name it. Do you need some cash?
No, no. Not this time. I've taken plenty of that from you already.
Danny, how do you mean?
It's your money. You made it.
I've known all along you've been carrying me, Scotty.
I'm gonna pay you back, every penny of it.
Danny, everything I've got is yours. Don't you know that?
I know. It's just that I can't stand sitting around in that room any more.
Well, that's simple. We'll just get you a better place.
No, the place is all right.
It's just that I gotta get something to do. The whole world doing things...
...and me stumbling around in a 2-by-4 grave.
No morning, no sun, no nothing.
I can't take it, Scotty. Can't take it.
I keep talking to myself by the hour and I got too much time to think.
About Peggy?
Scotty, get me something to do where I can be around people...
...and feel life going on.
Where everything isn't just a cold, gray fog smothering me.
I'll do anything. I don't care what it is, anything.
Coming up here, I heard a newsboy yelling and I remembered.
I used to do that. I used to sell papers and I'd like to do it again.
Well, that's a fine idea,
Danny. Sure, why not?
Just to get something to do. I don't care what. Just something to do.
Look, rest assured.
Whatever it is, we'll do it.
If we have to comb the whole town.
Just look at that. They guaranteed me it was gonna be a permanent wave.
Ain't permanent, ain't a wave, ain't nothing. It's just hair. But it's all my own.
You know, Gladys, it's funny.
After all the places I've been, things I've done...
...l've just moved across town, that's all.
From East Side to West Side.
You look out and see the same back alleys...
...the same fire escapes, the same clotheslines.
I'm back just where I started.
Wished I was back where I started...
...with a guy named Jake Smith right over in Jersey City.
He was just a grease monkey in a junkyard garage.
He only made 20 bucks a week, but he was great on this thing called love.
I was a dizzy dope. I was gonna burn up the world.
I got burned myself. Ever watch a moth fly in the flame?
Can't stop them till their wings burn off.
Believe me, if Jake would take me back now...
...l'd crawl on my knees right over to Jersey City, so help me.
We girls never get wise until it's too late.
Let me tell you...
What's the matter, Peggy, got hay fever or something?
Peggy.
I'm sorry, Peggy. I really didn't mean to...
Well, I didn't care for that routine that Gaul put in the show today either.
Nowadays the public wants class.
Give them their money's worth, that's what I say. Here, have a cigarette.
Let's see what's fit to print today.
"Blond beauty marries her fifth."
She gets five and I don't get one. Call that democracy?
"Fifty more millionaires reported last year."
Reported for what? Wish one of them would report to me.
Say, here's a guy with the same name as that pug you told me about.
"Edward Kenny, who will conduct his own symphony...
...with the Philharmonic at
Carnegie Hall this Thursday night.
This will be the world premiere of
Mr. Kenny's symphony, An American..."
Kenny. Could he maybe be a relative of that old heartache of yours?
Let me see.
Doing all right, Mutt?
We'll paste these clippings in a scrapbook.
Tomorrow we'll put the write-ups in.
Sure. This is gonna be a very fancy scrapbook.
I'll put them together with yours.
Keep away from mine. I don't wanna jinx the kid.
- Hi, Danny.
- Hello, Mr. Sinclair. Evening Post up yet?
- Right here. Late final.
- Final Variety hot off the press, Danny.
Okay, Smitty.
Oh, Mutt? Will you look in that
Variety and see if there's anything...
...about Peg this week?
- Sure.
How are you, Danny?
Well, did you see my scrib in the column yesterday about you?
Yeah, Mutt read it to me. I didn't like it.
Why? What's the matter?
I only wanted to be nice.
Don't like that tear-jerking sob stuff.
"One of life's little tragedies."
I don't want nobody crying over me.
I don't want no benefits. I'm on my own.
- I got no complaints.
- All right, Danny. I just didn't know.
All right, Pep. So now you know, huh?
Okay. Well, I'll be seeing you, Danny.
- Find anything, Mutt?
- No.
Maybe I missed it. I'll start over again.
Look in the vaudeville gossip column. Maybe something there.
Wait for me. Hello, Danny. Mutt.
What are you doing? You ought to be at Carnegie. What's the matter?
Nothing, just skipped out a minute to shake hands.
Getting kind of jumpy, huh, kid?
The nearer it gets to 9:00, the faster my heart goes.
Well, hold that ticker down, it'll hurt your timing. We're not worried.
We know it's good, don't we, huh?
Hey, what am I, a French general getting a medal?
- See you later, Danny. So long, Mutt.
- Good luck.
- Well...
- Good luck, kid. Hold that ticker down.
I will. Carnegie Hall, and hurry.
We're gonna be proud of him, Danny.
I'm proud of him right now. Well, come on, Mutt...
...you run home quick and get yourself all dolled up, see?
And I think you better get a shave too.
Why? I'm staying right here, ain't I?
Oh, no. You're going up to that concert. Here's the pasteboards.
That ain't right. This is your brother's show.
I'm staying here. This is your night.
I don't want to go up there and jinx the kid. Here.
What Are you talking about?
If it wasn't for you, he wouldn't be there.
I don't wanna be no skeleton in the closet. Now, take these.
Danny, why don't you go up and see it all.
Go ahead. Hear everything for yourself.
I know all that music backwards.
Backwards and forwards.
Besides, I got it all right here. Will you take these ducats?
Thanks, Danny. As soon as it's over, I'll come back...
...and tell you all about it.
- I'll be here.
- Sure you won't change your mind?
- No, no. You go ahead. Go on.
- So long, Danny.
- Good night, Mutt.
Speech!
Speech!
Ladies and gentlemen...
...once in each man's lifetime...
...there comes a supreme moment.
For me, here and now, this is it.
Not only because of the generous way...
...in which you have received my symphony...
...but because I can share this moment with one whose contribution to this music...
...is far greater than any that I could have made.
I am speaking of and to my brother.
He truly inspired the music that you have heard tonight.
For in his life story...
...was a story of the great city as I felt it in terms of music.
No, he's not a musician.
He couldn't read a single note...
...but in his heart and soul...
...there was such wealth of music. Music of the city.
The music that led him on to glory, to conquest, to tragedy and defeat.
But in that very defeat, he conquered.
For of all the men that I have come to know, who have loved and lost...
...this boy retained a great nobility...
...that far surpassed any possible conquest.
Yes, my brother made music with his fists...
...so that I might make a gentler music...
...the symphony that you have heard tonight.
It is his as much as mine.
And so, with deep pride and gratitude...
...I dedicate this music to my brother...
...known to most or you...
...as Young Samson.
Mutt. Mutt.
Hello, Danny.
Hello, Mr. Cahn. I wondered what happened to you.
- Kept you working late tonight?
- Why aren't you at your brother's concert?
I heard over the radio. Judging from applause there must've been 5000 people.
- It was a success.
- I'll say.
They're crazy about Eddie's music. Kept cheering and hollering.
Begging him to make a speech.
Imagine that brother of mine...
...talking to all those people.
- What'd he say?
Oh, nothing much. Just thanks and appreciation.
It must be wonderful to click that way.
- You should be proud.
- I certainly am.
I'll bet. Well, that's fine,
Danny. See you tomorrow.
- Yeah, thanks, and good night.
- Good night.
What paper, please?
What do you read?
Hello, Peg.
Hello, Danny.
Well.
Hey, this is all right.
This is really a night for the books.
I just finished listening to
Eddie's concert on the radio...
...and it's a big success.
And now Peg's here.
That's all right for one night. Did you...?
Did you hear about the concert?
Yes, Danny. I was there.
You were? Well, great, wasn't it?
Can you imagine that skinny-legged, redheaded kid...
...used to practice out on the fire escape...
...writes a symphony that sets a whole town on its ear.
Well, I guess we ain't got no squawk coming.
Looks like everybody from
Forsyth Street's doing all right.
Oh, Danny.
What's the matter, Peg?
What are you crying for?
You just came to visit an old pal.
Aren't you glad to see me?
I can't tell you how much, Danny.
Are you all right?
Sure, I'm better than that.
I got a soft touch here.
Keeps me out in the air.
I sell a hundred papers and make a buck.
Besides, I got a lot of good customers and they keep me busy.
I don't get much time for moping.
Then you are all right.
Oh, sure, I'm fine.
I still got my two eyes and they're getting better all the time.
That's what the doctor said. A year, maybe a little bit longer.
I can wait. Used to waiting.
Besides, I can always see anything I wanna see.
I saw you, Peg.
Danny, if I could help now, I'd do anything.
Well, you have.
Look, I never told nobody this...
...but...
...I always knew that someday you'd pass by here...
...and you'd see me.
Always knew that...
...because...
- Yes, Danny?
Because you were always my girl.
That's right, ain't it, Peg?
Always, Danny. Always.
Yes, brother, it's beautiful.
Didn't I tell you there was a heart beating in the city?
I've been all over. East Side, West Side...
...down in the subways, up in the elevators...
...flat with the river. And I report success.
There's a heart beating in the city.
You wont find it in the timetables, and you'll never see it advertised.
But take it from me, brother...
...there's love in New York.
And I know...
...because I got clothes on my back.
[ENGLISH]
It's your country and my country
With millions of real fighting men
It's your duty and my duty
To speak with the sword, not the pen
If Washington were living today
With sword in hand
He'd stand up and say
For your country and my country
I'll do it all over again
It's your country and my country
With millions of real fighting men
It's your duty and my duty
To speak with the sword, not the pen
If Washington were living today
With sword in hand
He'd stand up and stay
For your country and my country
I'll do it all over again
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[BAND PLAYING " MY SWEETIE" ]
[APPLAUSE]
[SINGING]
I never felt so happy before
A little rascal knocked at my door
It's Cupid that I'm speaking of
I'm in love, so in love
I must admit that right from the start
I went and lost my heart
Wait till you see me with my sweetie
Showing her off to the crowd
Looking so dreamy at my sweetie
Feeling so terribly proud
She makes a specialty
Of looking good to me
She ought to be right in Tiffany's window
She's a jewel
I know that you will agree
Wait till I'm married to my sweetie
How happy I'll be
I've got the bungalow paid for
I've had it specially made
For my sweetie
Sweetie-eetie-eetie
My sweetie and me
[APPLAUSE]
Even the matinees, he kills them.
That's why he's a great performer.
Well, he can get ready for the greatest performance of his life. This just came.
Oh, thanks. I'll take it.
[APPLAUSE]
- Hi, sweetie.
- Look, honey, from the president.
- Huh?
- Command performance?
The president of the United States?
Well, open it up. See what he says.
[APPLAUSE CONTINUES]
Yeah, let's see it. What is it? What is it?
Holy smoke, it's a command performance.
Oh, that's wonderfuI, Jerry, but what-?
- Aren't you excited? What'd he say?
- I love you.
- Oh, thanks-
- Will you marry me?
- What?
- Will you marry me tonight?
- Well, of course, but-
- WonderfuI.
Congratulations. Starting tomorrow, you're a war bride. Look.
I've just been drafted.
- Goodbye, Mama.
- Oh.
Oh, Maxie, listen to Mama.
I owe it to him. He helped us when we came to America. Now I help him.
But it was from fights and troubles we run away.
We didn't we start this one.
It's up to us Americans to finish it.
Look, Mama, see what it says?
"I want you for the United States Army. "
Uncle Sam has his finger on me.
- Goodbye, Ma.
- Goodbye.
Goodbye, my son, and take care of you.
Be a good boy and don't fight.
Yes.
[CORNET PLAYING SLOW TUNE]
Mrs. Dibble?
Mrs. Dibble? Oh, Mrs. Dibble?
Yes, Mrs. O'Brien.
Say, they tell me your Eddie's leaving for the war.
Yes, and the Army's glad they've got him.
Oh, so am I. Now maybe we can get some sleep around here.
Up-
[PLAYING BADLY]
All the time playing that cornet.
[SOBBING]
I know it'll be hard on you, but tell me, aren't you tiny bit proud?
I don't see what the Army wants with you, you'll never make a good soldier.
I can try it for a few months and see how I like it.
- If I don't like it-
- What?
I could try it a few more months.
Oh, it all comes from your wanting to march in parades and play in a band.
It's all the fault of that darn cornet.
Well, it won't be a cornet any longer.
From now on, it'll be a bugle.
[PLAYS BUGLE CALL]
[SOBBING]
[BUGLE CALL PLAYING]
So that's the bugler, huh?
Now I know the first guy I wanna kill in this war.
Does that mean we should get up?
Five-thirty? That can't be for us.
I didn't leave any call for 5:30.
I'm gonna roll over and get another 40 winks.
[BLOWS WHISTLE]
Get out of the beds!
I want this joint cleaned up before breakfast.
Get out of there, you.
Up.
The C.O.'s gonna give these barracks a white-glove inspection today.
So rise, my little beauties, and start to shine.
Ahh.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- All right, hi.
We're the new fellas.
We just got in last night.
- You slept well?
Oh, yes, sure.
You know, this bed's got the softest mattress I ever slept on the floor next to.
Say, listen, chum, there's a war waiting for you.
But I ain't. Now roll out of them sacks before I bust your ankles at the knees.
- Now, get out of there. You too.
- All right. All right.
You, my little white lily, up!
- You too.
- He's drunk with power, ain't he?
Hey, what is this 5:30 business?
Left shoulder. Turn!
- Left, left. Left!
Hey.
Platoon, halt.
Right shoulder. Turn!
Too fast.
What is the matter, can't you hear?
I'm telling you what foot to lay down.
- Don't you know your left foot from right?
- I know they're sore. I wish they were flat.
Shut up.
Oh, so the Army don't agree with you?
In some ways,
I don't agree with the Army.
Is it too much of a strain?
Wouldn't be if they kept sensible hours like civilians.
- What did you do as a civilian?
- Danced.
- What would you like to do in the Army?
- Dance.
Forward march.
I kept telling them you don't get no soldiers out of no draft.
So help me, when I asked what he'd like to do in this war, he comes back quickly.
" Dance," he says, " dance. "
Just like that.
Heh. Well, Jones was a dancer in civilian life.
One of the best too.
How am I gonna get over to a dope like that so that this here is a war?
Sergeant, there's a very necessary element with soldiering.
It goes by various names, but let's call it morale.
I ain't saying he's a dame chaser, sir.
Heh. No, sergeant. What I mean is that war is a pretty grim business...
...and sometimes a song or a smile is just as vitaI to an army as food.
- Hmm? Sir?
- Teach your men to fight, naturally.
But don't discourage their attempts to entertain one another.
As a matter of fact, encourage them.
Do you follow me, sergeant?
Yes, sir. Ahem.
Is there anything bothering you?
You can speak quite freely, of course.
No, sir, only as far as I'm concerned, we just lost this war.
- What?
- Sir. Uh-
Poor little me
I'm a KP
I scrub the mess hall
On my bended knee
Against my wishes
I wash the dishes
To make this wide world
Safe for democracy
That was swell. Don't forget to keep scrubbing the pots while you're singing.
And you move in behind a little sooner.
That fiddle, it could stand a little rehearsaI too. Well, what do you think?
Ah. Guys putting on a show give me a pain in the stomach.
Good. I was afraid you might like it.
Get those copies made as fast as you can.
- How's this, Jerry?
- Oh, that looks fine, fine.
But tone it down a little.
This is for the Army.
When you finish that, make me a sketch of the kitchen just the way it is.
- I wanna use it for the KP number.
Jerry.
Coming right over. Got a match, sarge?
- Here's the copies for the new numbers.
- Oh, fine.
I'll run over those in a couple of minutes.
Gotta get something snappy for the opening.
That looks great. That looks good enough to walk down 5th Avenue all alone.
[PIANO PLAYING SLOW DANCE TUNE]
No, no, wait a minute, fellas.
Wait a minute.
You're losing the spirit of things.
Sit down. I'll show you.
Look, fellas, this isn't a 5-mile hike.
Pick up the tempo. Raise your feet.
Come on. Let's try it again.
[HUMMING AS PIANO RESUMES PLAYING]
Got it, Joe? Run them through a few times.
They'll hit it.
All right, boys, line up.
- Don't forget that rehearsaI later.
- Okay, Jerry.
Two, three, four- One, two, three, four-
Now turn-
No, hold it, fellas, look.
Point your hands, toes.
Let's see those big smiles on your faces.
- That's it. Yes?
- Could you use me?
- What do you do?
- I'm the bugler.
Bugler? Whoa, hold it, men, hold it.
It's no use, they'll find another one.
- Do you do anything else?
- I play the cornet.
- Not as well as you play the bugle?
- Even better, perhaps.
That seems unbelievable.
- Bernie, hand me your cornet a minute.
- Okay, Jerry.
Here, play this for me.
Let's hear how it sounds.
Here you are.
[PLAYING SLOW TUNE]
Someday I'm going to murder the bugler
Someday they're going to find him dead
- How is the show going, Jerry?
- WonderfuI.
We're gonna have a great show.
[PLAYS OFF-KEY]
- Maybe I spoke too soon.
- Are these okay for the minstreI stand?
Yeah, fine. I'll be with you in a minute.
Gotta fix the finale.
God bless America
Land that I love
Stand beside her and guide her
To the right with a light-
Wait. Wait a minute, fellas.
Hold it. That song is out.
I got another number for that spot.
- What's the matter with this?
- It's a swell tune...
...but too slow for the finale.
I know what I'm talking about.
I got one that'll knock them out of their seats.
I'll sing in first-person chorus and you join in.
Here's the setting.
There's a big transport built on the stage.
Got orders, you're going overseas.
Everybody's marching with equipment.
You're on your way to France.
Go ahead, hit it.
[BAND PLAYING
"WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO FRANCE" ]
All is ready so just go steady
We must be going to the pier
No more waiting or hesitating
The time to sail is here
Bye-bye mothers and all the others
Who come to shed a little tear
Don't cry, bye-bye
Give us a parting cheer
We're on our way to France
Left flank, march.
There's not a minute to spare
That's why
For when the Yanks advance
You bet we wanna be there
Goodbye
[SIREN WAILING]
Hey.
Lieutenant McCarthy reporting.
The convoy is standing by.
Well, that's fine. Sergeant McGee?
- Yes, sir.
- Well...
- ... this is it. The trucks are here.
- We're ready, sir.
You instructed your men?
Everything's prepared.
We changed the routine on the finale.
Men will march out through the audience to the truck, sir.
That's fine.
Lieutenant, take charge of detaiI.
Yes, sir.
Well, this is what you wanted, isn't it?
Yes, sir.
Goodbye, sergeant.
- Best of luck.
- Thank you, sir.
The way the show is going over, it looks like we'll really run a year.
Brother, we've got marching orders and, soldier, you're really going to France.
[APPLAUSE]
Forward! Ho!
Old Hoboken is bent and broken
From soldiers marching on her pier
While you slumber, a great big number
That's not the way they rehearsed.
To the millions of brave civilians
That we are leaving over here
It's reaI. They're going.
Give us a parting cheer
We're on our way to France
There's not a minute to spare
That's why
For when the Yanks advance
You bet we wanna be there
Goodbye
Column, right.
March.
We're on our way to France
There's not a minute to spare
That's why
For when the Yanks advance
You bet we wanna be there
Goodbye
- Bye. No. Goodbye.
- Hey, goodbye.
- Goodbye, love.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Don't worry.
- Good luck.
- Don't worry.
Take care of yourself.
Don't worry, darling.
We'll be back in no time.
Good luck.
- Bill!
- Goodbye, Mom. Don't worry.
Oh, Eddie. Eddie, you never told me.
It's that darn cornet.
Oh, Eddie.
You bet we wanna be there
Goodbye
[GUNFIRE AND EXPLOSIONS]
[EXPLOSION IN DISTANCE]
It's a lot different from Yip! Yip! Yaphank!, huh, Jerry?
Oh, not much.
Sometimes it did seem a little noisier backstage.
I'm scratching all the names in the show on the bugle.
One's kind of hazy.
Who was that guy in the fifth row, third from the end?
You mean yourself?
Oh, yes, of course. Thank you, sergeant.
How could I forget? Eddie Dibble.
[EXPLOSION]
[EXPLOSIONS AND GUNFIRE]
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
- Who's that?
- It's me. Eddie.
- Are you all right?
- I'm afraid they dented my bugle.
Jerry?
Oh.
Give me your hand.
[EXPLOSIONS]
Goodbye, France
We'd love to linger longer
But we must go home
Folks are waiting to welcome us
Across the foam
A fond farewell to you and yours
We won the war to end all wars
The job is done
The Kaiser isn't coming back
So goodbye, France
[SOLDIERS CHEERING]
There they are, every one.
The fighters of Yip! Yip! Yaphank!
You know, I got a cousin like you.
That is one piece of government property
I'd like to see ruined.
There's Marty Brennan, dead.
The art guy.
There's Clark, dead.
They're not dead.
Not a single one.
They'II live forever on this bugle.
Hey, Max, Eddie.
- What are you doing here?
- Sorry, buddy.
Fine guys you turned out to be, leaving me in bed with nothing but a pitcher of water.
- Come on, Max, where's my drink?
- Coming right up, Jerry.
Uh-oh. What happened to the sergeant?
Somebody slip him a Mickey? I hope.
Ha-ha. I wonder what the sergeant would do after the war.
Me? I go back to my work, but him?
- He just goes back.
- Ha-ha.
Civilians. Hah!
Even in uniform, you're still civilians.
What about you, Jerry, what are you gonna do?
Oh-ho, don't worry about me,
I'll be all right.
I'll find some job that a fella with a game leg can handle.
But right now, I've got the biggest job of my life.
Listen to this, gentlemen.
" You have just become the father of an 8-pound baby boy. "
A father?
Yeah. Hey, sarge, wake up.
I'm a father. Look.
That's wonderfuI to have a little one to come home to. My Genevieve died.
- Genevieve?
- Heh-heh.
It's his canary bird.
[ALL LAUGH]
Let's put the baby's name on the bugle.
Has it a name?
- Not yet. Know what I'll call him?
- What?
John Jay Piercing Jones.
Fine. We'll make him the godson of Yip! Yip! Yaphank!
- A great show.
- You said it was a great show.
Let's drink to it.
[GLASSES CLINKING]
Here's to a great show.
May there never be another one.
" On this November 11 th, 21 st anniversary of the armistice of World War I...
...this is the record of those who said they had no more territoriaI ambitions.
Czechoslovakia, annihilated.
Albania, invaded. "
- is the number you have just heard.
And now we take great pleasure in presenting to you...
...the star of our program,
Miss Kate Smith.

Hello, everybody.
It is my happy privilege to introduce a new song, " God Bless America. "

While the storm clouds gather
Far across the sea
Let us swear allegiance
To a land that's free
Let us all be grateful
For a land so fair
As we raise our voices
In our solemn prayer
God bless America
Land that I love
Stand beside her and guide her
Through the night with a light
From above
From the mountains, through the prairies
To the oceans white with foam
God bless America
My home sweet home
God bless America
Land that I love
Stand beside her

Kind of makes you think of Blake, doesn't it?
Makes you think of a lot of things.
We're going to be in this yet, Mom.
[TURNS VOLUME UP]
- Hello, son.
Hi, Mom.
Hello, darling.
- New song?
- Brand new, first time on the air.
Brand new my eye.
You know, I threw that song out of Yip! Yip! Yaphank! 22 years ago.
Sounds better now.
God bless America

[APPLAUSE]
[EXPLOSIONS]
I guess that's all, Mrs. Nelson.
I just wondered if there was anything I could do.
No, Johnny.
Thanks.
He was a great guy.
Yes.
How is-?
Dorothy and Blake's baby?
Well, naturally,
Dorothy is very upset and she-
She feels kind of alone and helpIess with a baby that Blake never even saw.
I asked her to move in here with us, but her pride and...
I don't know what she's going to do.
Must be tough on a young wife, a baby.
I hadn't thought about it.
Call me if there's anything I can do, please.
Thanks, Johnny, but Ted is the man of the house now and he'II look after things.
I'm sure he will.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Look, Ma, look.
Ted gave all his stuff to me.
Even his best clothes.
Ted?
Yes, Mom.
I've got a little business to take care of for Blake.
Gee, I hope this is a long war.
I wanna get in it too.
[PAPER CRINKLING]
- There you are.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- I'd like a couple of dozen military marches.
- Yes, sir.
Johnny, what happened to you?
Nothing, I just changed clothes.
- You've enlisted.
- You knew it was gonna happen.
Oh, you look wonderfuI in that uniform.
Not any better than the rest.
We all have the same tailor.
It's 9:30 and I gotta report at 5:30 in the morning.
That gives us eight hours to do the town.
I can't leave yet.
Dad isn't coming back tonight.
- I've gotta keep the store open till 10.
- Miss Dibble, this is war.
- We're closing the joint right now.
- Oh. Oh.
- Come on, quit stalling.
- Wait a minute.

Johnny Doughboy overseas
Filled with pride and joy
Stopping everyone he meets
And shouting, "It's a boy"
What does he look like, that boy of mine?
Since the news came
I can't get him off my mind
Does he resemble his homely dad?
Does he look like the girl
That I left behind?
Bring on the Germans
And bring on the Japs
Bring on the first who you can find
One for the rascal I haven't seen
And one for the girl that I left behind
What does he look like,
that boy of mine?
Since the news came
I can't get him off my mind
Does he resemble his homely dad?
Does he look like the girl
That I left behind?
Bring on the Germans
And bring on the Japs
Bring on the first who you can find
One for the rascal I haven't seen
And one for the girl that I left behind
[APPLAUSE]
That must be a wonderfuI feeling for a soldier:
- To know there's somebody waiting for him.
- Yeah.
- Especially a wife.
- A wife?
Sure, it's very simple.
We stand in front of a minister, he asks me the question, I say, " I do. "
Then he asks you the question, you say, " I do. "
Or do you say, " I do"?
Honey, what could I offer you as the wife of a soldier?
A home, any kind of life together?
Just the right to write me letters.
You have that now.
I could sign them " Mrs. Johnny J.P. Jones. "
I've practiced.
And address them to Private Jones,
U.S. Army.
- Destination: Unknown.
- But, Johnny-
Look, honey, we've been going together since we were kids.
We can wait for marriage a little longer.
Much as I love you, that's just not for us right now.
We're not gonna get married before you leave?
No, honey.
And I know that's best.
It was proven to me.
How was it proven?
Well...
[SIGHS]
That's what I thought.
Oh, look, that would be the romantic thing to do.
Fellas all over the country, all over the world...
...marrying just as they get into uniform.
I don't have the right.
I've offered you the right.
Well, I guess I better get home.
Thanks for letting me know how you feeI about things.
Please don't follow me, Johnny.
I'm liable to say something
I'll be sorry for the rest of my life.
[PEOPLE LAUGHING]
Darling? Darling, where are you?
- Here. What is it? What's the matter?
- Oh, it's Danny.
Danny's enlisted.
Oh, that's wonderfuI. A son who does it the hard way. Where is he?
Hiya, Pop.
- The Navy?
- Well, Pop, between us...
...we have the situation in hand.
He does look rather nice, though, doesn't he?
But, Danny, how could you?

- Hey.
- What's going on?
- One, two-
- Bend down, here's the bull of the woods.
- Hey, arms down.
What's the matter with you, Twardofsky?
Don't you like our early calisthenics?
- I didn't like them at first.
- Didn't at first?
- How do you like them now?
- I'm still on first.
- Sarge?
- Sarge?
- How'd you get in the Army?
- Politics.
Po-? Is that a reason?
Look, sarge, and I got three reasons for being in the Army.
First, I'm patriotic.
Second, I love my country.
And third, they nailed me.
And that goes for me too.
Listen, you two boys report to me immediately after this formation.
Take them away, sarge.
You and my big mouth.
- Sergeant McGee.
- Eddie.
- Why, I see you're still with your first love.
- That's exactly right.
- Look at all the people coming in.
- Yeah, it looks like Sunday at the zoo.
Gotta hang up a sign saying,
"Please do not feed the soldiers. "
See your father?
- He's with the C.O., getting reacquainted.
- So is mine.
Took another war to get those guys together again.
There's a lot of mothers and sweethearts in that mob.
Speaking of sweethearts, get a load of that military objective approaching us.
- Shall I trip her?
- Hey, take it easy, yard bird.
The young lady happens to be a friend of mine.
- Hello, Johnny.
- Hello.
- I didn't expect to see you here.
- Neither did I.
Look, Tommy, why don't you take a ride now? I'll see you later.
Okay, maybe I'll pick up an MP.
Well. What brings you way up here in the sticks?
Dad came down to the old-timer's reunion...
...and he insisted that I come along at the last minute.
Sit down.
Thanks.
How do you like my new home?
Well, it's big enough.
- What do you think of the Army by now?
- Swell.
How do you feeI about things?
I'm more in love with you than ever.
But I'm more than ever convinced there's a job that has to be done...
...before we can even consider anything else.
Oh.
Don't you realize that if all men felt like you...
...there wouldn't be any more families?
- There wouldn't be any more world.
- You're so unreasonable.
I'm not unreasonable.
We're in a war.
And untiI it's over, our private lives must just stand still.
Does that mean we're supposed to stop living?
As Johnny Jones, private citizen, yes.
I'm CorporaI Jones.
I don't know how long it'll take to get back to being Johnny Jones, private citizen.
But untiI I am, I don't intend to leave anyone on my conscience back home.
That's only logic.
All right, Johnny, you win.
After the war is the time for taking a wife.
But you'll have to find a wife first.
Well, boys, here we are.
I wanted to conduct this little tour personally.
This is where Yip! Yip! Yaphank! was born, remember?
Who could forget, sir?
- A million years ago, it seems like.
- Seems like it was only yesterday to me.
- I was quite a man in those days. I thought.
- Yeah.
You certainly were mean to me and my bugle.
You didn't do us any favors blowing that thing at half past 5 every morning.
Ha-ha-ha.
Same old spirit after 23 years.
We're a couple of years older...
...but there's things about the Army you never forget.
Very true.
That's right.
Hey, fellas, look at this.
The same old kitchen just like it used to be.
[SINGING]
Poor little me
I'm a KP
I scrub the mess hall
On my bended knee
Against my wishes
I wash the dishes
To-
Heh. I didn't remember it then,
I don't remember it now.
[ALL LAUGHING]
You know, your voice hasn't improved with age either.
Say, fellas, look.
Here's a list of the old gang.
Well, what do you know?
I'd forgotten about this.
Yip! Yip! Yaphank!.
The names of all the men in the show.
There's Marty Brennan, killed in action in the Oregon.
And this little one here, Peterson,
I don't remember him.
Remember the kid from Texas who opened a grocery store?
- Oh, yes.
- He's gone.
Hey, there's my name.
I put it on when you weren't looking.
Remember Dopey Milligan who knew he'd get killed?
- He's now an undertaker in Des Moines.
- No.
Yeah.
[ALL LAUGHING]
And there's Johnny Murphy.
Remember that skinny little kid used to be dancing all the time?
- I wonder what ever happened to him.
- Here I am.
- And I'm still hoofing.
- Ho-ho-ho.
Johnny, you look like the kid that swiped the watermelon.
[ALL LAUGHING]
You should see Doc Plosky if you wanna get a laugh.
- He combs his hair with a toweI.
- No, look who's talking.
[ALL LAUGHING]
Yes, indeed, it was a good show.
It was a great show.
So were the men in it.
It was some war too, the old war.
Yeah, that was the war to end all wars.
And now we've got a new one.
Well, what are we waiting for?
A new war, a new show.
I knew it. Sir.
[LAUGHS]
- Jerry, what do you say? Will you help?
- Sure, I'll help.
It'll be something for the boys to remember.
There'll be a lot of it that they'll wanna forget.
ColoneI, that just reminded me.
I've got a son at the camp who's got talent.
Maybe we can use him.
- I've got one too.
- I've got a son too.
What's the matter with my boy?
What about us old-timers?
We ought to be in it.
That's it. We ought to do an old-timer's number, what do you think?
Right. Swell idea.
Well, how about it, Murph?
[TAPPING RHYTHMICALLY]
- Let's go.
- Murph is ready.
I'll tell you what. We'll do the number we did in the last show.
Remember the drill we used to do with the dance steps?
You fellas all line up just like you did on the stage.
And when the band starts to play,
I'll step down in front and I'II-
We'll figure the number out so you fellas can do it without me.
I'll be busy backstage-
- What do we call the show?
- Yip! Yip! Yaphank! II
No, no, Max, that's no good.
It's a new war, new show.
We've got to have a new name.
Well, why not state the simple fact?
This Is the Army
What do you think?
- Great.
- That's a great title.
That's it. This Is the Army
CorporaI Oxford and Private Joe Cook, Jr. Yes, sir.
- CorporaI Oxford?
Yes.
- Private Cook?
- Yes.
Report to Captain Frank's.
You're in the Army show.
- Sergeant Stone.
- Coming, lieutenant.
You're gonna be in the Army show.
Yes, sir, we'll have this tank right aft-
- What show?
- It's for Army Emergency Relief.
Yes, sir. CorporaI Mitchell speaking, sir.
Oh, that's great. I mean, yes, sir.

Report to the C.O. right after this trip.
CorporaI Barker...
...you'll be on detached service with the Army show.
Allon brothers, report to the Orderly Room immediately after the firing.
[CROWD CHEERING]
Sergeant Joe Louis Sergeant Joe Louis
After the bout it over, report to the Orderly Room
CorporaI Burrell, report to headquarters immediately.
Private Cristiani, Private Steiner, change to o. d., report to the Orderly Room.
CorporaI Perry, report to your commander.
Bernie, when you're finished with that, report to the Orderly Room.
Twardofsky...
- ... report to the orderly camp.
- Yes, sir.
Pack your equipment, we're leaving to join the show.
Yes, sir.
Well, that's all there is to tell you about the show.
I'm sure that you're all fully aware that this is for a vitally important cause.
As to your conduct in this detaiI, remember that you're still in the Army...
...and every theater in which you work...
...becomes an Army post in the strictest sense.
You will continue to receive your military training before and after performances.
For your military duties, you'll be commanded by Sergeant McGee.
In command backstage will be CorporaI Jones.
Take over, sergeant.
I've had strict orders from the coloneI not to use any profanity today...
...so I can't tell you what I think about Army shows.
[CLEARS THRO AT]
Company, attention.
Right face.
Forward, march.
This sure cooks me up.
I lose my girI with a flag-waving speech about a job to be done before I marry her.
What's the job? Helping put on a show.
Shut up back there.
There's one of the nicest guys ever born.
That guy wasn't born, he was issued.
Did I say shut up, or did I?
I can see Mom out there.
She's sitting with Eileen's mother.
But I don't see Eileen. Where's Eileen?
- I wouldn't know.
- You wouldn't-
You wouldn't know?
You're gonna marry that girI.
- It was my intention.
- That was your-
What's the matter with that son of mine anyhow?
[PLAYING BUGLE CALL]
Hey, come on. Hurry up. Hurry up.
Johnny, why aren't these men in their places?
- Don't they realize-?
- There's time. Get going.
That " Mandy" crowd, half of those fellas haven't got their costumes on yet.
I'll guarantee everything will be ready on schedule.
Take it easy, Dad. You're trying to take care of every little detaiI in the whole show.
- That's too much for one man to do alone.
- That's right.
I have been getting in everyone's hair.
That's not true. You've been swell.
- Okay, Johnny. I won't say another word.
- Heh. See you later.
Come on, let's go.
The curtain's going up.
Focus that thing right now.
[SOLDIERS CHATTERING]
[PLAYING BUGLE CALL]
You thought that many, many years ago
You saw the last of every soldier show
But here we are, yes, here we are again
A lot of water's gone across the dam
Since we put makeup on for Uncle Sam
To treat you as our fathers treated you then
We were drafted by our president
And we march with banners unfurled
We were drilled and trained to represent
The greatest army in the world
Yes, the greatest army of actors
In the world
Now, don't get us wrong
We're not here for long
Our stay in the theater is brief
We're here with the show
To help get some dough
Some dough for the Army Relief
The much-needed Army Relief
But beneath the powder
And beneath the paint
There's a soldier brave and true
If some guy in Congress tells you
That we ain't
Let him do what we had to do
And go through what we went through
[DRUM BEATING]
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]
[SINGING]
We all have been selected
From city and from farm
They asked us lots of questions
They jabbed us in the arm
We stood there at attention
Our faces turning red
The sergeant looked us over
And this is what he said
This is the Army, Mr Jones
No private rooms or telephones
You had your breakfast in bed before
But you won't have it there anymore
This is the Army, Mr Green
We like the barracks nice and clean
You had a housemaid to clean your floor
But she won't help you out anymore
Do what the buglers command
They're in the Army and not in a band
This is the Army, Mr Brown
You and your baby went to town
She had you worried but this is war
And she won't worry you anymore
This is the Army, Mr Jones
No private rooms or telephones
You had your breakfast in bed before
But you won't have it there anymore
This is the Army, Mr Green
We like the barracks nice and clean
You had a housemaid to clean your floor
But she won't help you out anymore
Do what the buglers command
They're in the Army and not in a band
This is the Army, Mr Brown
You and your baby went to town
She had you worried but this is war
And she won't worry you anymore
More, more
No, she won't worry you any
More

- Sergeant Dick Bernie, front and center.
- Ho!
Big bunch of selectees.
You know, I was a selectee once.
[CHUCKLES]
Tell me, Dick, how do you like the Army now?
[THUMP]
I said, how do you like the Army now?
- It's a military secret.
- What's the matter with the Army?
- It's a little too feminine.
- Feminine?
With all those women auxiliaries?
Like the AWBS, the Red Cross...
...the Father Duffy Canteen, the WAVES, the WAGs, the WOOWOOs, the WOWOWs.
And not forgetting the WAACs.
That's fine.
That shows the women are really patriotic.
Maybe. But when I come home from camp on a pass...
...after slaving all week over a hot gun, heh-heh, I'm raring to go.
I got a box of flowers and a box of candies.
I run down the street, ignoring lights.
I run into my hoteI, up the elevator.
Knock on the bell, ring the door, the door opens, and there's my wife.
I look at her and she looks at me.
I look at her and she looks at me.
- Why don't you kiss her?
- I can't. She's a first lieutenant.
[MEN AND AUDIENCE CHUCKLING]
- Oh, she's a WAAC.
- That's beside the point.
The worst part: I gotta get permission from the top sergeant to talk to her.
- Oh, what's tough about that?
- The top sergeant's my mother-in-law.
[LAUGHTER]
Heh-heh-heh.
The top sergeant's my mother-in-law.
[LAUGHS]
He hasn't got a mother-in-law.
I'll get even, take them on a rifle range, show them how to use a rifle.
- You'll show your wife how to shoot a rifle?
- My mother-in-law too. Same bullet.
- Well, you have to be a marksman for that.
- Really?
Take me.
I'm the best marksman in the country.
What makes you think you're the best marksman?
- I'll give you an instance.
- I'd like to hear an instance.
The other day, I went hunting in the woods.
In front of me, I saw a big tree.
Seated on one limb of the tree were 14 birds.
Fourteen birds? I'll be right back.
Fourteen birds were seated on one limb of the tree. Heh-heh.
He don't care about nothing.
He looks like a guy from my draft board.
Everybody in. Heh-heh.
You heard of The March of Time?
There's his brother, Waste of Time.
[ALL LAUGH]
I caught you.
Oh, it's alive. Heh-heh.
Come on. Wipe the smile over your face.
Come on. Get serious.
Get serious.
Think of your salary. That did it.
What were you saying about the birds?
- Fourteen birds on one limb.
- Yeah.
- I looked at my rifle, I had one bullet.
- My.
My objective was to get the birds with one bullet.
- You can't do it.
- I did it.
- How?
- I took my rifle, aimed, fired.
The bullet split the limb, birds got their feet caught on the limb.
I walked over, sawed off the limb, put it across my shoulder...
...walked home with the 14 birds...
...and it wasn't a good day for hunting that day either.
- You wanna hear reaI shooting?
- Yes.
Spread. Make it look like a regiment.
I was out in the woods, hunting.
Saw a deer. Picked up my rifle, aimed to fire, when I heard noise.
What you think it was?
- What?
- Wild ducks.
I wanted those ducks.
I picked up my rifle, when I heard noise. What was it?
- What?
- Geese.
I didn't want deer, ducks,
I wanted geese.
Picked up my rifle, aimed to fire, when a snake jumped up in front of me.
Boy, I changed my plans completely.
I didn't want deer, ducks, geese,
I wanted snake.
I picked up my rifle, aimed, fired.
BarreI split in two.
One went right, killed the ducks.
One left, killed the geese.
The bullet shot the deer.
The snake, I choked him to death.
The gun hit me. I fell into the river.
Come out with boots full of fish.
I take a fish.
- What happened?
- What?
Button snapped off my coat, killed a rabbit. Heh.
And it wasn't a good day for hunting that day either. Heh-heh-heh.
I'd have killed more, but I was tired that day. Heh-heh.
I'll go quietly. Ahem.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
CorporaI Jimmy Burrell, front and center.
You're ordered to sing what may very well be every soldier's theme song:
" I'm Getting Tired So I Can Sleep. "
[SINGING]
Out on a hike all day, dear
Part of the Army grind
Weary and long the way, dear
But, really, I don't mind
I'm getting tired so I can sleep
I want to sleep so I can dream
I want to dream so I can be with you
I've got your picture by my bed
It will soon be placed beneath my head
To keep me company
The whole night through
For a little while, whatever befalls
I will see you smile
Till reveille calls
Till reveille calls
I hope you're tired enough to sleep
And please sleep long enough to dream
And look for me for I'll be dreaming
Dreaming
Dreaming
Dreaming of you the whole night through
For a little while, whatever befalls
I will see your smile till reveille calls
Till reveille calls
I hope you're tired enough to sleep

Ooh
And look for me for I'll be dreaming

It was just somebody serenading
Something like this

There's a minister handy
And it sure would be dandy
- If we'd let him make a fee

He's the funniest man in the number.
Got somebody to replace him?
- How about Tyrone?
- Oh, no.

Now, listen, McGee.

How many times do I have to tell you...

The day you become a soldier,
I'll be pushing up daisies.

Will you pick that thing up?
Mendes, you're impossible.

Is all we heard from where we sat
Now, how about a cheer for the Navy?
The Army's great, the Army's tough
But don't you think we've heard enough?
So how about a cheer for the Navy
We know that Mr Stimson
Is solid as the rocks
But how about an orchid
For Secretary Knox?
The Army may be in the groove
But Walter Winchell won't approve
Unless you give a cheer for the Navy
Hip hip hooray
We haven't got long to stay
So how about one bouquet
For the Navy?
One word of praise,
Let it flow from your lips
One cheer and then
We'll go back to our ships
Hip hip hooray
The Army has had its say
You're letting them get away
With the gravy
Just let them know
That an Army show
Could never be a hit without the Navy
The Army's what you may prefer
But in the social register
Is where you'll have to look for the Navy
If you would like to touch the gilt
Of Astor or of Vanderbilt
You'll have to come around to the Navy
The show was in the alley
It simply wouldn't do
Until the big finale
With Navy white and blue
The Army sails across the foam
The Navy always brings them home
So how about a cheer for the Navy?
Hip hip hooray
We haven't got long to stay
So how about one bouquet
For the Navy?
One word of praise,
Let it flow from your lips
One cheer and then
We'll go back to our ships
Hip hip hooray
The Army has had its say
You're letting them get away
With the gravy
Just let them know that an Army show
Could never be a hit without the Navy
Give a cheer, give a cheer, give a cheer
Give a cheer for the Navy
Just make it clear that a rousing cheer
Is very much in order for
the N

Anderson, is everything set for " Stage Door Canteen"?
- Props and everything?
- Yeah. This just came for you.
All right, get on-stage, you prima donnas.
Let's go.
Get on for " Stage Door Canteen. "
Hey, fellas. Get a load of this wire.
Anybody I know, John?
We're going on tour. What do you know?
- " Boston, Philadelphia, Washington. "
- Washington?
Hey, wouldn't it be something if the president came to see us?
Wouldn't it be something if we could get this makeup off...
- ... before the war is over?
- You said it.

Teddy, take over.
Turn right, march.
Well, say something. Hello, at least.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- This uniform.
- Oh. Red Cross auxiliary.
I'm helping out back home in my spare time.
- Did you come to see the show?
- I wanted to see Dad and the president.
- And you.
- Me?
I've missed you a lot, Johnny.
I tried to convince myself you're not worth bothering about.
I just haven't got the willpower,
I guess.
- I've missed you too, plenty.
- Thanks.
Eileen, there's something
I'd like to explain.
- About our marriage?
- Yes.
There are a million guys thinking of the same thing:
What to do about their girI back home.
Well, it was when I went to see
Mrs. Nelson. Just before I enlisted.
Remember when Blake was killed at PearI Harbor?
Yeah, I know.
But what has that got to do with us?
Well, she was telling me about Blake's widow, Dorothy.
Just a kid, but a widow with a baby.
Lonely and sort of helpIess.
With so much pride, she wouldn't impose on anyone.
You'd be like that, Eileen.
That's no future for you.
But, darling, you weren't killed at PearI Harbor.
Besides, how could I be a widow with a baby if we don't get married?
That's just why we don't get married untiI this war is over.
- CorporaI Jones, they're waiting for you.
- Coming.
You understand, don't you? Don't you?
Will I see you after the show?
- I don't know.
- Please, say you'll meet me right here.
Johnny.
You better hurry.
Men, you know who's going to be out in front tonight.
Our boss.
The president of the United States.
Now, you guys have given a lot of great shows...
...but tonight's gotta be the best one of all. All right, sergeant.

Merrily we appear on the scene
Hostesses of the Stage Door Canteen
Sponsored by a lady
With the wisdom of an owl
Waiting for instructions
From our captain, Jane Cowl
Good evening, ladies.
Good evening, Miss Cowl
Tonight's a speciaI occasion so be especially bright.
The cast of This is the Army will be our guest tonight.
They must have fun, but don't be fools.
It must be done according to the rules.
- You must be ladies
Don't worry, Miss Cowl
Merrily we appear on the scene
Hostesses of the Stage Door Canteen
Entertaining soldiers
Who are going off to war
Glad to be of service
But we could do much more
We could do more for the boys
And greatly add to their joys
But we don't get very far
The rules and regulations
Are we mustn't be seen
Outside the canteen with a soldier
They each could do with a gal
Would greatly help their morale
But we simply must resist
We take an oath when we enlist
To never be found
Canoodling around with a soldier

What a lovely group of soldier boys we have here tonight.
Now I must do something for you.
But what can I do? I have no talent for dancing or singing.
But I have got Alfred.
Ah-ha-ah. Ah-ha-ah.

Alfred Fontanne. Alfred Lunt.
Alfred.
[IN MANLY VOICE]
Alfred!
Where are they? Where are they?
Oh, I thought it was
Abbott and Costello. Ahem.
I want you to get out of that kitchen, help me entertain these men.
Lynn, darling, I experience a rarer ecstasy in that kitchen...
...than I have ever experienced on any stage.
When 8:00 comes, instead of the stage manager...
...knocking on the dressing-room door, calling, " Fifteen minutes, Mr. Lunt"...
...EtheI Barrymore says:

"Hamburgers...

[AS CHARLES]
"I adore them.
They remind me of the Casbah, of Paris and pink champagne.
Next week, I'll be back at the same time with Hedy Lamarr...
...and I hope you will receive her with your usuaI discriminating kindness.
So untiI then, au revoir. "
[APPLAUSE]
[NORMAL VOICE]
I ask Herbert Marshall...
...how he likes hamburgers, and Herbert Marshall says:
[AS HERBERT] " Many people ask my opinion of hamburgers.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's more than an opinion, it's an adoration.
But hamburgers throw themselves away in this frantic desperation to do something.
And in the end...
...does anyone love hamburgers?
Do they love anyone? No.
But do I love them?
Why, you silly little things...
...of course I love them.
What a question. "

Just as forgetful as I can be
I've got the strangest sort of a mind
I'm always leaving something behind
I left my heart
At the Stage Door Canteen
At the canteen
I left it there with a girl named Eileen
A girl named Eileen stole his heart away
I kept her serving doughnuts
Till all she had were gone
I sat there dunking doughnuts
- Till she caught on
Till she caught on
I must go back to the Army routine
The old Army routine
And every doughboy
Knows what that will mean
Will know what we mean by routine
A soldier boy without a heart
Has two strikes on him from the start
And my heart's at the Stage Door

He must go back to the Army routine
And every doughboy

And I would like to state
The life is simply wonderful
The Army food is great
I sleep with 97 others
In a wooden hut
I love them all, they all love me
It's very lovely but
Oh, how I hate to get up in the morning
Oh, how I'd love to remain in bed
For the hardest blow of all
Is to hear the bugler call
You gotta get up, you gotta get up
You gotta get up this morning
Someday I'm going to murder the bugler
Someday they're going to find him dead
I'll amputate his reveille
And step upon it heavily
And spend the rest of my life in bed
Oh, how I hate to get up in the morning
Oh, how I'd love to remain in bed
For the hardest blow of all
Is to hear the bugler call
You gotta get up, you gotta get up
You gotta get up this morning
Someday I'm going to murder the bugler
Someday they're going to find him dead
And then I'll get that other pup
The guy who wakes the bugler up
And spend the rest of my life in bed

CorporaI, I've decided you don't know what the war is all about.
We're free people fighting for the right to remain free.
To work, to be married and to raise a family in a fine, decent country.
Eileen, honey, I know that.
Then why do you act like we've lost the war?
Open your heart, Johnny.
We're all in this fight together.
Women as well as men.
Let's share our responsibilities.

On the pages ofAmerican folklore, a legion ofmighty men have left the symbols oftheir greatness,
There was Paul Bunyan ´s ax;
John Henry´s hammer;
Davy Crockett´s rifle; and then, quite unexpectedly, one comes upon a tin pot hat, a bag ofapple seed,,, and a holy book,
And strangely enough, these are the symbols of one ofthe mightiest men ofall--
John Chapman, a real-life pioneer,
With the passingyears, however, reality has given way to legend, until today we know this remarkable man simply as Johnny Appleseed,
This is his story, told by an old settler who knewJohnny well,
Listen,
[ Old Settler Narrating ] Well, sir, every time I see an apple blossom sky,,,
I think ofJohnny Appleseed,
´cause, of course, them clouds up thar, they ain ´t really clouds at all,
No, sir,
Why, shucks, there wouldn ´t be no apple blossom sky,,, ifit weren ´t for the fact thatJohnny--
But now, hold on here, Guess I´d better start back to the beginnin ´,
That´s when Johnny lived on a farm near Pittsburgh town,
The year was 1 806, or maybe there around,
Now,just to look at him you´d sayJohnny Appleseed never would make a pioneer,
- ## [ Whistl i ng ]
- He was such a sawed-off, scrawny little fella,
´Course that didn´t faze Johnny none,
Shucks, he had his apple trees and the morning sun and the evening breeze,
- ## [ Conti nues Whistl i ng ]
- [ Twitteri ng ]
# The Lord is good to me #
# And so I thank the Lord #
# For givin´ me the things I need #
# The sun and rain and an apple seed #
#Yes,  He´s been good to me #
## [ Continues Whistling ]
# I owe the Lord so much #
# For everything I see #
# I´m certain ifitweren´t for Him #
#There´d be no apples on this limb #
# He´s been goodto me#
# Oh,  here am I ´neath the blue,  blue sky #

# Oh,  the Lord is good to me #
## [ Continues Whistling ]

That´s howJohnny spent each day, attendin´ to his apple trees,
But lately littleJohnny here would feel a stirrin´in the air--

""Well, what´s holdin ´ya,Johnny?, "" says a voice,
""Go on, Go on out west, ifthat´s your choice, ""
Well, sir, it was an angel,
Johnny´s own private guardian angel,
Might look mighty queersome to you and me, but, you know, that´s just the way
John figured he ´d be,
Wel l,  speak up,  boy.
Don´t stand there gawki n´.
U nlock your jaw and get to talkin´.
Y-Y-Yes,  sir--
Yes,  sir!.
Why don´t I go west?.
´Cause I ain´t got the muscle... nor the breadth ofchest,
Out tharit´s the strong men who survive, and I´m about the puniest feller alive.
Shame to ya, Johnny.
You got faith and courage and a level head.
But,  shucks, you see,  sir, all I know is... apple trees.
And what´s wrong with apples, ifyou please?.
Ain´t they ´bout the finest fruit in all the land?.
Why,  shoot,  man, they take the cake.
Just think, Johnny, of all the things that apples make.
There´s,  uh, apple pickles.
# Oh-so-tastyapple tarts andapple pastry#
# Apple dumplings
Not to mention-- #
- Applesauce?.
- Yes!
# And there´s apple fritters light as thistle #
# And for folks to wet their whistle #
[ Together ]
# Tangy apple cider in a glass #
Stew ´em,  fry ´em, boil ´em,  bake ´em.
- Apple pie and apple cake ´em.

# You can cook ´em any way#
# There´s apple this andapple that#
#The recipes´d fill yer hat #

[ Together] #There´s a lot ofwork out there to do #
# Oh,  there´s a lot ofwork to do ##
[OldSettler]
Well, sir, that´s howit all began,
That´s howJohnny, all alone, set out to meet the great unknown,
´Twas a mighty big and fearsome place,,, for a man to face,
A little man, and all alone, without no knife, without no gun,
And though the forest is dark and wide,,, with fearsome critters on every side,
Johnnyjust kept walkin ´ on,
Walked until at last he found a little spot of open ground,,, with fertile soil and warmsome breeze, a likely place for apple trees,
Now, the varmints here, they couldn ´t know,,, ifJohn was friend orJohn was foe, so some took off in sudden flight,,, and some got set to claw and bite,
But ifJohnny seen ´em he paid no heed,
Just got busy a-plantin´apple seeds,
## [ Whistl i ng ]
## [ Conti nues ]
Now, them varmints come from everywhere,,, to watch that man a-diggin´ there,
Didn´t like what they was seein´,
Didn´t trust no human bein´,
## [ Conti nues ]
Yep, that ornery human had to go,
But who was a-gonna tell him so?,
Well, not a soul could answer that,,, till here come along a black-and-white cat,
Now, he weren´t too bright, but he didn´t much care,
He knowed he had a certain ai r... about him,
## [ Whistling Continues ]
[ Sniffi ng ]
## [ Continues ]
Well, sir, that done it,
The critters ne´er seed the beat ofthat, the likes ofa human a-likin´ that cat,
Why, shucks, this little man had went and busted every precedent,
He was the very first to come,,, without no knife, without no gun,
And so it was, from that time on, every last livin ´ varmint was a friend to John,
- ## [ Conti nues ]
- They surely was,
# The Lord is good to me #
# And so I thank the Lord #
# For givin´me the things I need#
# The sun and rain and an apple seed#
# Yes, He´s been good to me ##
Well, as time went byJohnny kept right on a-plantin´his apple trees,,, and makin´ friends everywhere, and his best friends was the pioneers,,, for, of course,John was plantin´more than an apple tree,
He was plantin´his own boundless faith and courage too, and that give folks new heart, new hope in the job they had to do,
As more and more pioneers come to push back the forest, the kindly deeds oflittle Johnny Appleseed,,, spread throughout the land, and more ´n once, with a good old-fashionedjubilee, folks would honorJohnny Appleseed and the fruit ofthe apple tree,

[ Old Settler ] Now, sometimes ifJohn was a-passin´by,,, he´d mosey over and kinda look in on the doin´s,
´cause it sure tickled him to see how the fruit ofhis labors,,, brought all kinds offolks together and made ´em good neighbors,

[ Old Settler] Yup,Johnny did bring folks a heap ofhappiness,
But, shucks, he weren´t lookin´ for thanks,
Didn´t have time fer it,
He knowed a man can´t take no rest,,, ifhe aims to plant the whole darn wilderness in apple trees,
And so it was-- for more´n 40 year,,,
John walked and planted that old frontier,
[ Thunderclap ]
Yes, sir, 40 years of walkin ´ and plantin ´,
And in that space oftwoscore year,,, this little man, he throwed his shadow clear across the land, across 1 00, 000 miles square,
And in that shadow everywhere,,, you´ll find he left his blessin ´s three:
[ Chorus ]
# Love and faith #
# And the apple tree #

There´s poetry in trees, they say, and, well, one day a poet found it,
Then a music master wove around it,,, melody,
An artist touched it, gave it form in colors rich and warm,
And now we bring to you these three:. poem, picture, melody,
A simple tribute to a tree,

# I think that I shall never see #
# A poem lovely as a tree #
# A tree whose hungry mouth #
# Is pressed#
# Against the earth ´s sweet flowing #

# At God#
# All day #
# And lifts her leafy arms #
# To pray #

Uncle Roy.
- Yes,  honey?.
- What makes the wolves howl like that?.
Wolves?. Ha!
Those are coyotes.
-Aren´t they, Roy?
- Yep,  they´re coyotes. Bobby´s right.
- They always howl when the moon is bright.
- Why?.
Well, that´s quite a story,
- Cowboys in it?.
- Yes, sirree,
- I njuns too?.
- Well,  could throw in maybe two or three.
But mostly this story is about Pecos Bill.
- Pecos Bill?. Who´s he?.
-## [ Guitar: Sharp Strum ]
- What?. Never heard of Pecos Bill?.
- Imagine that.
Why,  I thought everybody knowed Pecos.
Why,  Bobby, 
I´m surprised at you.
Bill was the world´s greatest buckaroo.
# He was the roughest, toughest critter
Never known to be a quitter #
# ´Cause he never had no fear for man nor beast #
- Yep,  that there Pecos Bill was--
- [ Whinnying ]
Easy,  Trigger.
I´m not forgettin´ Bill´s horse.
Why,  shucks, 
I couldn´t forget Widowmaker.
- Widowmaker?.
- [ Laughs ] That´s a funny name.
But that horse earnedit just the same,
- He was a killer.
- Dynamite on the hoof.
Yep,  Widowmaker was Bill´s best pal, until along came that beautiful prairie gal.
[ Whinnying ]
- Aw,  shucks. A woman in the story.
- But what a woman.
# She was fresh as the dew#
# On a prairie rose #
# A true thoroughbred #
# From her head to her toes #
#That there was Slewfoot Sue #
# Sweet Sue #
Slewfoot Sue. Huh!
I´d rather hear about the coyotes.
Yes,  Uncle Roy, you started to say--
Why the coyotes howl at the moon that way?.
You´re right,  honey, but it all fits together.
Can´t tell one without the other, because the story of Bill and that Slewfoot gal... is the story of coyotes and why they howl.
I´m gettin´ down to the details right now.
Now,  here on the map ofthe old U.S., completely surrounded bywilderness,  lies Texas.
-[Cowboy] Amen,
- ´Course,  there´s some other states scattered around.
- Yeah, like Wyoming,
- Milwaukee,
-And Long Island Sound,
- Right,
[Roy Rogers ]
Down Texas way a river flows,
Where it comes from, nobody knows,
Where it´s a-goin´ don´t no one care,
Just doggone glad it´s a-leavin´ there,
- That there´s the Pecos River,
- She was pure alkali,
Just naturally mean water,
Why, the buzzards won ´t even touch it,
-## [ Whistling ]
- Into this fertile garden spot,,, once there come a prairie cart,
- [ Shouti ng,  Chatteri ng ]
- There was Ma and Pa and 1 6 brats, four hound dogs--
[ Cowboy ]
Yeah, and a couple of cats,
[ Roy Rogers ]All a-goin´ west, lookin´ for elbow room,
Sure could use some ofthe same,
Crossin´ the Pecos River bed, somethin´ fell out and lit on his head,
Folks didn´t even know he was gone,
Ol´ wagon just kept a-rollin´along,
Yep, it was Bill,
Poor little critter,
Homeless as a poker chip,
# ´Long came night and a prairie moon #
# Old Ma Coyote a-hurryin ´ home #
# She was due for a shock at herjourney´s end#
# Fer the stork had delivered a dividend#
Plumb unusual!

´Tain´t never happened before,
-Probably one ofthem newfangled models,

# Bill looked up and then he grinned#
Shucks!
# Ma´s ol´heart just plumb caved in #
# Bill seen right off that he needn´t fear #
# He´d staked himself a claim right here #
Headed straight for that old chuck wagon,
Yep, ol´ Bill was hungrier than a woodpecker with a headache,
And so it follered as a natural fact,,,
- that Bill growed up with that coyote pack,
- [ Growls ]
He soon become the main top hand,,, in a way they all could understand,
[ Yel I i ng ]
But little Bill, he couldn´t rest,,, till he´d proved hisself the A- 1 best,
So he studied the other varmints too, then showed ´em all a trick or two,
Outloped the antelope,
Outjumped the jackrabbit,
[ Rattl i ng ]
[ H issi ng ]
[ Yel I i ng ]
Yeah, Bill even outhissed the rattlesnake,
# Then one day #

# A stranger come #

Now, 50 to 1 weren´t no fair fight, but one plus Bill made itjust about right,
[ Yel I i ng ]
Well, it was the beginning ofa beautiful friendship,
From that time on them two stuck together,,,
Iike warts on a toad, like birds ofa feather,
When Bill growed up, it was natural, of course-- he ´d choose a career to suit him and his horse,
Yep, Bill become a rootin ´, tootin ´ cowboy,

Now, Bill was happy that fateful day, a-killin´some time in his carefree way, inventin´a one-man rodeo,,, a-buttin´heads with the buffalo,
Poor Bill,
Yeah, happy as a hog in a turnip patch,
And then old man Fate started dealin´ from the bottom ofthe deck, for down the stream come Slewfoot Sue,,, with all her charms revealed to view,
Looked like somethin´ from out´n a dream-- first female woman
Bill´s ever seen,
## [ WolfWhistle ]
- She was strange,
- Unusual,
Yeah, but powerful stimulatin´,
Like a slug ofrye on an empty stomach,
# Give ´im a right peculiar feelin´#
# Set his senses plumb to reelin´#
-# With a poundin´sound inside his ears #
- [ Stampeding Hoofbeats ]
# Like the gallopin´hooves ofa thousand steers #
# Inside his chest was a-seethin´and churnin´#
# His blood was a-boilin´
His brain was a-burnin´#
# A-burnin´ with the fires that could only be cooled#
# In the beckoning depths #
# Oftwo blue, limpid pools #
Yep, I ´amour had come to Pecos Bill,
[ Barki ng,  Howl i ng ]
Yahoo!
Widowmaker was plumb puzzled,
Looked like trouble to him, and he sure was right,
Bill was busy inventin´ courtin´, western-style,
# He arranged for the moon #
# To rise just right #
# And flood the land#
# With a silvery light #
# Ordered the stars #
# In heaven above #
# To form a token #
# Ofundying love #
# Then, ´cross the sky #
# In words offire #
# Bill told sweet Sue #
# Ofhis own heart´s #
# Desire #
# Sweet Sue #
# I love #
- [ Kissi ng Sound ]
-# You ##
And so Sue named the wedding day, but there was a price
Bill had to pay,
Sue wanted a bustle-- the finest, of course-- and she aimed to be wedded a-ridin´ Bill´s horse,
Well, Sue got her bustle and it sure was classy,
Put the finishin ´ touch on that sweet gal´s chassis,
Why, that there happy, blushin ´ bride,,, was a-bustin ´ out with girlish pride,
## [ Wolf Whistles ]
But Bill had promised Slewfoot Sue a ride on Widowmaker too,
[ Gul p ]
- Would that horse be willin´ to let Sue ride?
- [ Whinnying ]
Well, here comes the answer-- fit to be tied,
Widowmaker was plumb irritated,
But it didn ´t bother Sue none,
She walked right up to that critter´s side,
Her gentle hand touched his bristlin ´ hide,
Her foot found the stirrup, With a flick ofher bustle, Sue was aboard,
- And sought for the tussle,
- [ Yawns ]
The proceedin ´s begun to commence,,, forthwith,
[ Widowmaker Whi nnyi ng ]
No doubt about it.
That there Sue was a regular female buckaroo.
[ Whinnying Continues ]
And then, that bustle--
Underneath them frills and flounces,
Sue was developin´ plenty ofbounces,
Got to be more´n that gal could handle, and Sue took off like a Roman candle,
That devilish contraption ofsteel and wire,,, kept bouncin´ that poor gal higher and higher,
Soon it was plain to the multitude,,, that Sue was a-gainin´altitude,
Sure looked like she was a goner,
But no,
Here come a ray ofhope,
Look! I t were Bi I l and his trusty rope.
He´d durn soon put a stop to this,
- Shucks, Bill was never knowed to miss,
- [ Crash ]
Bill was calm, confident,
He built his loop with careless ease,
He judged his distance, tested the breeze,
Then a whirl and a twirl and a twist ofthe wrist,
He let ´er go,,, but the champeen missed,
How it come to happen, nobody could ever figure out,
## [ Whistl i ng ]
She was offagain on her heavenly flight,
Up, up she went, clean out ofsight, till far into space this unfortunate maid,,, finally come to the moon, and that´s where she stayed,
In the state ofTexas,
U,S,A,,
Iife still goes on in the same old way,,, and the Pecos River still flows on, but the greatest cowboy on Earth,,, is gone,
Yeah, Bill went back to the coyotes, but he never forgot Sue,
And every night, when the moon ris´high, he´d lift his voice in mournful cry,
- [ Howl i ng ]
- Bewailin´ the fate ofhis lady fair, his long lost love in the sky up there,
- [ Howling Continues ]
- So painful was his griefto see, the varmints joined in out ofsympathy,
And that´s how come, to this very day, coyotes howl at the moon that way,
- # Move along #

- # Move along,  move along,  move along #
# Soon the dawn will come #
# And you´ll be on yourway #

[ Howling ]
But Father Fitzgibbon, why do you want a new furnace?
Because, Mr. Haines, last winter, in the month of November alone, four of me perishiners took to the bed with pneumonia.
Well that's too bad.
It's only by a miracle that I meself pulled through.
And it'll only cost $632.50, complete with an automatic damper.
But Father Fitzgibbon, I didn't come here to put in a new furnace.
I think you oughta give him his furnace, dad.
It would warm people's hearts and maybe his collections would be bigger.
No son.
Improvements are out.
Now Father...
That was good, what he said, that was good.
Oh, well he's new to our business.
Now Father...
No furnace huh?
No furnace.
Now Father, here's my business.
You owe the Knickerbocker
Savings and Loan Company five payments on this mortgage, and if they're not taken care of, I'm afraid the
Knickerbocker Savings and Loan Company will have to take the necessary action.
Huh?
Why don't you make that the subject of your sermon next Sunday?
Tell it to your people.
The Lord loveth the cheerful giver?
Oh I can imagine meself saying that in Mass next Sunday.
What a sermon that would be, Mr. Haines.
The text of me sermon this morning is taken from the mortgage.
According to Mr. Haines.
From the first to the 23rd clause.
If they'd only know.
Oh but that's your business.
Keep it bright, huh?
No, but seriously Father, we've made a bad loan and we want our money back.
Well you'll get it somehow.
Ah, well that's all I wanted to know.
Well good day, Father.
Come on son.
Dad.
You can't foreclose, why it just hasn't been done.
I read up on it, and there's never been a Catholic Church foreclosure in the history of New York.
Well there's always a first time isn't there?
Don't you think you're being a little harsh with him?
You've got to be.
Son, never loan money to a church.
As soon as you start to close in on them, everybody thinks you're a heel.
Well aren't you?
Yes.
Good morning!
Excuse me, but could you tell me where I'd find St. Dominic's Church?
Eh?
I'm looking for St. Dominic's Church.
Why?
I'm gonna work there.
The new assistant eh?
And you can't even find the church.
Well all I can say is, young man, you're off to a mighty bad start.
What's your name?
Father O'Malley.
Charles Francis Patrick O'Malley.
What's yours?
Her name is Quimp!
Hattie Quimp!
You'll see a lot of her, you will.
At St. Dominic's she's a regular two-dayer.
Very religious.
Burns candles.
I could tell you plenty about them too.
And if I did, they'd have to leave the neighborhood!
If you're looking for
St. Dominic's, Father, it's a block up and then to your left.
Thank you.
Hello.
Hello.
How's things going?
Aw terrible.
They never hit one to me.
Watch right field for me a minute, will you Father?
Sure.
I gotta run in the house.
Okay.
Hey fellas, the Father's gonna take my place!
Okay Father!
I got it!
Got it!
Thanks.
What do you think you're doing?
I'm a substitute right fielder.
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.
Playing around with a lot of kids, smashing people's windows.
A big grown up man.
And a priest besides.
Oh hello.
Still looking for St. Dominic's?
You just wait 'til I tell Father Fitzgibbon.
Look, you keep out of this will you?
Go on, go on.
This is between him and me.
Honestly, I'm sorry about the window.
Yeah, but being sorry don't fix it.
Well I intend to pay for it.
When?
Priests never have any money.
That window...
Now wait a minute, my good man.
I said I'd pay for it and I told you I'm sorry.
What else can I say after I say I'm sorry?
Well that ain't the idea, it's the principle of the thing.
A priest didn't oughta go around breaking people's windows.
It sets a bad example for the children.
You got me stymied there,
I'm contrite and I'm penitent.
I told you I'm sorry.
Yeah, you told me that twice, but that don't...
That doesn't fix the broken window, I know, I know.
I think you're just plain hard to get along with.
Maybe a little security might help.
Huh?
These were given to me.
Why don't you keep them until I've made good?
Maybe they'll make you feel better.
They're mother of pearl, you see?
If that'll satisfy you, I'll run along.
Hey you.
Here.
I got no use for this.
First place, I don't believe in it.
As a matter of fact, I don't believe in anything.
I can believe that.
I'm an atheist.
Besides, I'm superstitious.
All right then, I'm sorry about the window, I'll have it fixed.
Can I have the ball back?
You even throw like an atheist.
Mrs. Carmody, did the young priest come yet?
He's here.
But he insisted on changing his clothes before seeing you.
Ah, that's nice.
Tidying himself up a bit.
Hello Father.
I'm your new curate, Father.
If you'll excuse my appearance.
I know it's not possible.
The bishop may have a grudge against me.
He may think I've a mouth full of clover and can't preach, but even the bishop wouldn't do a thing like this to me.
I see what you mean.
Young man, may I ask is that the official garb of the priests in St. Louis?
No, something happened to me on the way over.
I guess this just isn't my day, Father.
Do you mind if I...
Nah.
Eh.
Young man, as a matter of curiosity, what made you become a priest?
Why I...
Hello?
Well you don't say.
You don't say.
Oh yes, I can well believe it.
Mrs. Quimp?
Oh yes, yes indeed, Miss Quimp.
Yes indeed, I appreciate your good intentions.
Yes yes yes.
Goodbye, yes, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
I guess she told you about me huh?
Yeah, the girl is all bitty.
Young man, I'm afraid you're off to a very bad start.
That's what she said.
I'm sorry, Father.
Smashing people's windows, such conduct.
Oh yes, that reminds me, I wanted to ask you something.
Tell me young man, how did you happen to become a priest?
Well I...
Yeah?
Chuck?
Chuck who?
Father Chuck?
That's me.
Here, I'll take it over here.
Hello?
Timmy!
Well how are you Timmy?
Oh I just got in.
Well what do you know.
That's Father O'Dowd, an old friend of mine.
We used to go to school together.
♪ Hail alma mater, thy time honored halls ♪
♪ Shall echo with our praise 'til we die ♪
♪ And round our hearts are the ivy-covered walls ♪
♪ Of East St. Louis High ♪
Oh ho, good Chuck, good, good.
Can you talk?
Well no.
All right, then I'll do the talking.
How does your new pastor impress you?
You're a big help.
Well it's a little early to say.
Time will tell.
Uh-uh.
No, I think it'd be better if I told you when I saw you.
Yes, it'd be much better.
All right Timmy, make it soon huh?
So long.
Oh he's a great little man.
Yeah, yeah.
Well what were we talking about?
I was going to ask you something...
You were gonna ask me if
I wanted to see the church.
Yes, that's right.
I like this.
It's beautiful.
Thank you.
How long you been here Father?
45 years.
46 in October.
The church?
The same.
I built it.
Can only hope someday I can say I built as much.
This is nice.
Yeah, the birds like it.
They're good company.
Listen.
Yes, I've taken a great deal of pleasure in me garden.
It's been hard work, but it's been worth it.
I think you'll find this a very pleasant place in which to meditate.
You do meditate don't you?
Oh yeah, sure.
Now I'll show you the church.
What we really need is a loudspeaker system.
For a minute I thought I found a four leaf clover.
Guess it just isn't my day.
Would you like to see the...
Oh yes!
Oh Mrs. Carmody!
Just a minute.
Just a minute.
Where's Father O'Malley?
He left early this morning.
The young man doesn't sleep as late as you do, you know.
Huh?
Oh, oh.
What's this?
His luggage.
Just arrived.
Golf, tennis.
Now where may I ask is his fish pole?
It's here.
Good morning, Father!
Been to market huh?
Mrs. Carmody could attend to that.
You should've been making parish calls.
I have.
Mrs. McGonagall, you know, the one with the big house and rheumatism?
She sent you a present.
Oh she did huh?
How very generous of her, I must say.
A fine Christian woman in Mrs. McGonagall.
I wonder what it is.
Something to eat, I dare say.
Jam!
No, pickled pigs feet.
Possibly some brandy peaches.
Oh if there's one thing I'm partial to, it's a nice big jar of brandy peaches.
A nice basket too.
Yeah, she wants it back.
They're too young, O'Malley.
Much too young to be separated from the mother.
That's what she said.
So here's the mother.
Ain't she cute?
Hello baby.
The joy of giving is indeed a pleasure.
Especially when you get rid of something you don't want.
Oh Mrs. McGonagall is famous for these tricks.
When her husband died she sent me his umbrella, his long flannel underwear, and his mustache coat.

Timmy how are you?
Hiya Chuck, I'm glad to see you.
Glad to see you.
How long is it since we've seen each other?
Four years.
Oh five anyway.
Has it been that long?
Yes.
Pardon me.
Father Fitzgibbon, this is my old friend Father O'Dowd.
How are you, Father Fitzgibbon?
We've been friends since we were knee high to a nibbly.
He was our local Huckleberry Finn.
Laugh and the world laughs with you, he used to say.
Cry and you cry all by yourself.
How are you, Father Fitzgibbon?
I just dropped by to see if Father O'Malley could play a little golf this afternoon.
Oh you did?
Where's your parish?
Right over here, St. Francis.
Well now, about your golf.
'Course I can't answer for you, but at
St. Dominic's we've very little time for games of golf and sunshine.
And if you're working for me, all I can say is that you wouldn't have time for either.
It's lucky for me then that I'm at St. Francis.
It's my hope St.
Francis can say the same.
Uh-oh, he's got you there Timmy.
Good Father, very good.
Say Father, why don't you come around with us sometime?
It's a grand game.
Sure Father, we'll teach you.
A man is never too old to learn.
A lot of nice fresh air out on the golf course.
And profanity too.
No.
A golf course is nothing but a pool room moved outdoors.
You mind if I use that one sometime Father?
Young man, would you mind?
How did he ever become a priest?
Well I don't...
Father Fitzgibbon.
Excuse me.
Who is it?
Mrs. Quimp.
Oh gosh.
Does he know?
Does he know what?
That you're in charge.
How'd you know?
I didn't.
Ha.
I gathered as much when
I heard you were here.
Everybody knows that St.
Dominic's is in a bad way.
Father Fitzgibbon is getting to be an old man.
This needs a young Father...
Timmy, look.
Don't mention it to anybody.
Oh no, no.
You see, when I had my talk with the bishop it was our understanding that Father Fitzgibbon was to remain here as pastor and I was to try and straighten out St. Dominic's without hurting his feelings.
I see.
You're in charge but you're not.
I don't think I'd like an assignment like that.
But the bishop couldn't very well put him out to pasture could he?
Pasture?
What's this I hear about a pasture?
I was just saying to him, Father.
The next time I come "past your" church
I'm going to drop in and see you.
Good day, Father.
So long, Chuck.
I was going to ask you something.
Oh yes, the telephone.
Mrs. Quimp just telephoned, her landlord has thrown her out again, she'll want somebody to go down and see her, you better go...
I'll go right along, Father.
Will you mind the puppies?
Yeah.
Thank you.
I'll bet you're the new assistant, the one who's going to get St. Dominic's out of all its trouble?
And I'll bet you're all the trouble.
I'll wager you're the man with the mortgage.
Oh you've heard about the mortgage?
All churches have mortgages.
It isn't respectable for a church not to have one.
My name's O'Malley.
Mine's Haines.
Nice meeting you.
We may have to touch you for a little more a little later on.
Eh?
Yeah, we're gonna need a new paint job here pretty soon.
But I must run along.
You look like a man it'll be a pleasure to do business with.
Yes.
Get out!
Get out, you're not throwing me out!
And I'll pay you me rent when I get it!
Good morning, Father.
Morning.
Hello, Father.
Mrs. Quimp and I were just discussing you.
Oh you were?
As you know, I represent the
Knickerbocker Savings and Loan Company.
And in as much as Mrs. Quimp declines to pay her rent, the Knickerbocker
Savings and Loan Company refuses to offer her any further hospitality.
Is she very far in her rears?
Mrs. Quimp has paid us nothing for six months.
Well it's certainly very nice of you to show her so much leniency.
Supposing the poor old woman has no place to go.
Well the Knickerbocker
Savings and Loan Company is not a charitable institution,
Father, like St. Dominic's.
With us it's just a matter of cold-blooded business.
Well with you it's different.
You haven't got anything and you don't want anything.
That's your business, and people respect you for it.
But I'm not in your business, see?
If I haven't got anything and don't want anything, I'm a bum.
Surely there must be something we can do about it.
Well I don't know what you're gonna do about it, but I'm going to throw her right out on her ear.
Now why don't you give her a break?
Give her a month to make good in.
St. Dominic's will guarantee it.
St. Dominic's?
Yeah.
I can see you haven't been around long, Father.
Why St. Dominic's is in worse shape than Mrs. Quimp.
My old man happens to own the mortgage and he says...
Oh your father holds the mortgage eh?
You're darn right he does.
And confidentially, I think he'd like to find a way to foreclose.
He wants to tear down the church and making a parking lot out of it.
Can you imagine?
Oh he's a very disliked man.
I'm sorta following in his footsteps.
Junior eh?
Yeah.
Let's cut through the churchyard.
Good afternoon boys.
Oh hello, Father.
That's a fine fat bird you have there.
Oh, well we were sorta bringing it over for you.
It's sorta a present ain't it Herman?
Yeah!
Well now that's very generous of you.
Such a fine bird and all.
Now where, may I ask, did you get it?
We got...
We won it in a raffle over at the theater.
We were lucky.
Why isn't that great huh?
But surely your mother...
Well except on Christmas, ma don't like turkey.
She don't huh?
Honest.
Well now that's most fortunate for me, for there's nothing I'm more partial to than a nice Tom turkey, roasted all with dressing.
Well I appreciate your kindness, boys.
Aw it ain't nothing, Father.
Oh on the contrary, I appreciate the thought behind it.
Small luxuries, like small sacrifices, are oftentimes the most godly.
Well bless you both.
Thank you.
Take it in, inside the kitchen's the housekeeper.
Okay Father, we'll see you later.
So you guaranteed
Mrs. Quimp's rent did you?
Of course I did.
St. Dominic's can't afford it.
I expected you to counsel
Mrs. Quimp, not to adopt her.
Ah, hot turkey.
Hot?
Of course it's hot.
That's what I said.
Bless us, oh Lord, for these thy gifts we are about receive in the name of amen.
Amen.
Say Father, you know a youngster around here named Tony Scaponi?
Mmmhm, what about him?
Well this afternoon...
Tony belongs to a fine, upstanding Catholic family.
11 children.
Oh sure I know Tony.
As fine a lad as there is in the parish.
Police don't think so.
Oh they don't huh?
No.
If something isn't done about Tony and his pals, I'm afraid they're gonna wind up in a reform school.
Who told you that?
The police.
Oh you've been listening to Patrick McCarthy no doubt.
Let me tell you that that...
That man hasn't been to
Mass in the last 10 years.
That may be, but I think
McCarthy's right about those kids.
They're terrorizing the whole neighborhood, Father.
Always talking like that.
To hear the police talk, you'd think that every lad in the parish was a criminal.
I'll have you know that the very food there before us is brought to us by two of those very lads that the police are so maliciously slandering.
Is that so?
Tony Scaponi was one of them.
I gave them both my blessing.
And they gave you the bird.
Yeah.
I'll get it.
Hello, McCarthy.
Oh good evening, Father.
Well I brought 'em.
Tony Scaponi, Herman Langerhanke.
Hi fellas.
I don't think you have to wait, McCarthy.
Well okay, Father.
Say, I understand that you fellas like baseball pretty well huh?
Yeah.
I was thinking Saturday the Yanks are playing the St. Louis Browns, a double header.
Would you like to go out and see the games with me?
St. Louis my old hometown, you know.
I get all the passes I want.
What do you say?
Well I guess so.
Yeah, yeah sure, I guess the fellas would like that.
That's a date then.
I'll meet you here Saturday at noon?
Yeah, that'd be good.
You run along and have your dinner.
I'll go finish my turkey.
Let me see, now where was I?
Oh yeah, I know.
I was going to ask you something.
Oh yeah, what made me become a priest?
No no no no.
About young Tony.
What was it the police accused him of?
Stealing.
Stealing?
Stealing what?
Turkeys.
Seems the boys hijacked a poultry truck down the street here and there was quite a bit of excitement.
The driver reported them to the police.
And did that poor man get his turkeys back?
All but one, Father.
Thank you.
Hello McCarthy, how are you?
Good morning, Father.
You open for business?
Always open for business, McCarthy.
Come on in.
You just wait here.
Come right in, Pat.
I got a problem, Father.
Yeah?
Seems like it's more yours than mine.
Mmmhm.
It's her.
Well Father, it's this way.
Last night I'm walking my beat, see?
And who do you think I run into?
Her?
Mrs. Quimp.
Ah.
"Officer McCaddy" she says.
You know how the old stool pigeon talks.
Yes I do.
"If you'll go around the corner you'll find a girl.
"I've been watching her and she ain't up to no good."
Well Father, I go around the corner and there, like the
Quimp says, I find her.
You follow me, Father?
Yes I am.
Well I look at her and size her up.
One of those things, I think.
And I'm just about to say to her no sister, not on my beat.
When she turns, and right away I see another line.
You follow me Father?
Mmmhm, yup.
Well to get down to her, Father,
I find she's broke and run away from home.
There's no soul in town.
So instead of booking her, I take her home.
It's all right with the Mrs for one night, but if she stays any longer, well I guess
Mrs. McCarthy, good woman that she is, is no different from any other woman.
You follow me, Father?
Yeah, I follow you.
So anyway, she tells us that she's run away from home on account of her folks don't understand her.
We tried arguing with her,
Father, but she's a tough one.
She thinks honor thy father and thy mother is a belly laugh.
Well Father, guess I'll let you pick it up from here.
Says her name's Carol James.
All right, McCarthy.
So long, Father.
Goodbye.
All right, you can go in now.
Come right in.
Would you sit down over here?
Carol.
Suppose you give us your version of it huh?
I guess it's just about like he said.
You don't get along with your parents.
No.
So you're going to leave home?
Oh I've left.
How you fixed for funds?
I haven't any.
That's how I met Officer McCarthy.
Oh but I'll get by.
How about you go back home.
I tell you, at home my life is intolerable.
Parents?
We don't agree on anything.
Don't like the way I do my hair, my eyebrows, too much lipstick.
Something or other.
Too long, too short.
Do you think it's too short?
Well I...
I don't know.
They even object to my boyfriends.
And if they do let me go out they say "where are you going?
"Come home early!
"Come right home after the show!"
"No drive-in."
And no matter how early
I get in, it's too late.
And if I say we ran out of gas, they say I'm lying.
Are you?
Sometimes.
Did you ever think of maybe having the boyfriends over to the house?
Now you talk like they do.
I tell you why I can't have them over to the house, because grandma sleeps in the living room.
She does huh?
By 9 o'clock we have to be off the couch.
She needs it for a bed.
Can you imagine?
Course you know, there might be two sides to it.
Maybe you're being a little unreasonable.
I'm 18.
18 huh?
As old as that?
You know, when I was 18 I thought my father was pretty dumb.
After a while when I got to be 21 I was amazed to find out how much he learned in three years.
Oh well.
Now that you're in New York, what do you propose to do?
I'm going to get a job.
I'm a singer.
A singer huh?
You any good?
Well of course I'm good.
What makes you think so?
Well I'm just good, that's all.
Well would you sing something for me?
Maybe I can help you.
I'm supposed to be a pretty good judge.
You wouldn't know the kind of songs I know.
How do you know?
Do you happen to know Day After Forever?

Hello, Father.
This young lady came to us for some help.
So it's work you're wanting.
Yes, Father.
Well I think maybe I can place you.
You can?
What would you think of a little general housework?
Mrs. Scaponi with all those children.
11, no 12, 12 in October.
I think maybe she could use you.
Oh no.
I'm not looking for that kind of work.
I don't think you understand
Father, she's a singer.
Aren't you?
Well now.
And where, may I ask, are you expecting to find employment?
In some nice cool airy nightclub I suppose.
Any prospects?
Well no.
Not exactly.
And you're willing to starve rather than push a broom.
You have a home, I presume.
Oh she just left it, Father.
Then go right back to your parents.
A fine little girl like you singing in some place like the
Blue Goose or something.
Well you've got to start someplace, Father.
Nonsense, being a good wife and a mother is a good enough start for you.
Like your own mother.
Well goodbye, Father.
Goodbye.
Hey.
Young lady.
You go home and stay home until the right man comes around.
The right man will never come near our house.
But don't worry.
I'll get by.
Carol!
Wait just a minute.
Father.
Do you think you may have 10, Father?
Of what?
She's all alone, she hasn't a thing.
Open up our hearts, huh?
Just a minute.
How about five eh?
Five?
No no, 10.
Carol, I didn't like the way you said that "I'll get by."
Here's a little something to tide you over.
Oh, it's fine...
It's all right, it's not charity.
It's a loan.
Thanks.
I can use it.
I appreciate it.
Carol, I guess there's a lot of things
I should have said to you, advice for one thing or another, but you wouldn't have paid any attention.
After all, you are 18 aren't you?
Don't worry.
I'll be all right.
Of course you will, Carol.
I'll get by.
Oh don't say that.
Now let's hear from you, huh?
All right, Father.
Bye.
Bye Carol.
Hey fellas!
What are we doing hanging around here for?
'Cause I promised
O'Malley, that's what for.
Why?
'Cause I said so, see?
Hey fellas, look.
Waist petticoats.
First thing you know, he'll be charming us into these things.
Yeah, making altar boys out of us.
First guy up, I kick his teeth in see?
Now look yous, O'Malley's a right guy, see?
Pick him up.
Now look yous, O'Malley's a right guy, see?
He didn't rat on us about the turkeys did he?
No.
Took us to a baseball game didn't he?
Yeah.
Bought us hot dogs didn't he?
Yeah.
He's gonna take us to a picture show ain't he?
How do we know?
Hello Father.
Say hello to the Father.
Hello Father.
Hi fellas.
Hey Father, where'd you get the outfit?
That's the St. Louis Browns.
I told you I used to work out with them.
They thought I brought them luck.
When I left town they made me a present of it.
Oh that's just the outfit to wear in a cellar.
Oh you, knocking my team.
Well I guess you fellas wonder why I asked you down here huh?
Well hey Father, I wanna talk to you a minute.
Can I?
Wanna see me?
Yeah, just a minute.
Pardon me boys.
Tony, what's on your mind?
Well Father, so you won't have no beef coming,
I'm laying it on the line okay?
Okay.
Well he's here, Father.
Like I promised, only you should've heard him squawk.
Worse than that turkey.
Oh the turkey, they did huh?
Yeah, they figured that being a priest you was gonna slip them the old routine.
Oh yeah.
Personally, I'm for giving you a break, and what I says is what the gang goes.
Swell of ya, Tony.
Aw it ain't nothing, Father.
Only the way it is now Father,
I'm on a hook for you, see?
I'm responsible for you, get me?
I won't let you down Tony.
Well maybe you won't, but I'm telling you, you step out of line just once and me and the gang will drop ya like you was a hot potato.
Okay?
Okay, can I talk to them now?
Oh sure.
Go ahead.
Boys, I'm not gonna do much talking.
Like Tony says, I'm gonna lay it right on the line.
I asked you down here to do me a favor.
St. Dominic's needs a choir and I wanna start one.
I know, I know what you're thinking, but it's not gonna be that way at all.
It's gonna be fun.
Believe me, I like fun as much as anybody.
If it doesn't turn out that way, if you think
I'm trying to slip something over on you, well like
Tony says you can "drop me like a hot potato."
What do you say?
You gonna give me a break?
Well Father, that depends.
What is it?
Well how many of you here know Three Blind Mice?
I know it.
One.
Two, any more?
Three.
Oh come on, you all know it.
Everybody knows it?
Fine.
What's the matter with him over there?
Oh Herman?
He's pouting.
Hey Herman!
He's got a good bass voice.
You want him?
Well certainly, Tony.
You've got him, Father.
Now let's see, we gotta divide this up some way.
Hey Herman, wait a minute.
The Father wants to see you.
Well I don't wanna see the Father!
Shhhh.
What is...
Keep quiet, will ya please?
Don't hit me on the head, you make me dopey!
You are dopey.
Now keep quiet.
But I...
Come here.
Now look, he wants a bass singer...
I ain't a bass singer!
You are a bass singer!
Why am I a bass singer?
Oooh that burns me up!
My head, my head!
Shhh.
He wants a bass singer.
I don't know how to...
Will you go down please?
Will you go down?
Now keep quiet, okay?
Let's go.
Okay.

It's no business of mine Father, but sometimes the things you do in haste are the things we most regret.
Think it over a while.
Then if you really feel you must see the bishop...
That I do.
But the boys are much better off here than running the streets, I'm sure that was Father O'Malley's idea.
I'm a charmed man, Mrs. Carmody.
But there's some things that get under my skin and Three Blind
Mice is one of them.
But he's young, Father.
Eh?
I admit, maybe a wee bit impulsive.
But I know he means well.
And after all, it was the bishop himself did put him here.
Yeah, and the bishop himself will put him someplace else.
I'm going to ask to have
Father O'Malley transferred.
Don't worry.
It's not a bad report I'll be making.
I'll just tell the bishop that this young man and I, that we don't see eye to eye, and I'd be happier if he was sent some other place.
It's a long hard road you've come, Father.
45 years and most of the time carrying other people's burdens.
The time has come when you should rest on your oars.
Take things a might easier, enjoy your life.
Let somebody else carry the load for you.
Surely Father O'Malley's got a strong pair of shoulders.

Oh that's fine boys.
Thanks very much.
Wanna call it a day?
There's still enough light outside for some baseball.
Let's sing some more, Father.
Yeah, let's go ahead.
You saw the bishop, Father?
Yeah, yeah.
Would you ask Father O'Malley if he'd mind stepping into me study?
You wanted to see me, Father?
Yeah, yes I did, I did.
Sit down, sit down.
Father O'Malley, I've been to see the bishop.
Oh you have?
And I want to be frank with you.
I must admit that my purpose in going to see the bishop was to have you transferred.
I'm sorry you don't like me, Father.
I don't dislike anyone.
It's just that I disagree with you.
What did the bishop say?
After a little talk, he congratulated me on my 45 years at St. Dominic's.
He has a remarkable memory.
He said it was a monument to the fact that I had built it.
Coming from the bishop, that's certainly a fine compliment.
Then I told him I'd come to talk about you.
That seemed to disturb him.
Then he started telling me about what a fine young man you are.
Capable, progressive, how much confidence he had in you.
He even told me that he had a nice talk with you before you reported to me.
Course he didn't tell me what you two talked about.
He didn't have to.
I could see it in the good man's eyes.
When you get to my age you can tell that, you know?
Then after a little more telling me how progressive you were, he asked me why I'd come.
Unknown what was on his mind, and to save him the embarrassment of having to tell me.
The bishop wouldn't hurt anyone.
I put him at his ease.
Bishop, I said, the very thing that's on your mind is on mine, it's the very thing I've come to see you about.
I want you to put young Father O'Malley in charge of St. Dominic's.
The bishop seemed much relieved.
He congratulated me on my ability to see so clearly at my age.
On my ability to face the inevitable.
Then what happened?
That was all.
Oh Father.
Why can't we go along just as we have been?
No no, you're in charge now.
Sit down.
No Father.
Sit down, I'll familiarize you with...
There's no hurry, we can do that anytime, Father.
Well is there anything you'd like me to do?
I mean now.
Nothing.
Well then.
If you don't mind, I'll lie down a while before dinner.
All right, Father.
When you and the bishop had your little talk, it was more or less along those lines wasn't it?
Yes.
I think you better start without him.
Looks like he's not coming down for dinner.
Well he said he wanted to take a little nap.
He didn't look well did he?
When he came in this evening.
Go see if he's awake.
If he's coming down, I'll wait for him.
Father O'Malley!
Father O'Malley!
Father!
He's gone.
He's packed his things.
Everything.
He's gone.
Where would he go?
I can't imagine.
Okay, sure.
But keep at it, will ya?
No, you can't miss him.
A little guy.
Old.
Got a grip and an umbrella.
Okay.
Nothing yet, Father.
They're gonna check the subways, the hospitals.
Look Father, take it easy will you?
And you better go home.
No use the two of us getting drowned.
All right, but you call me the minute you hear anything.
I will.
I don't care what time it is.
I will, Father.
Shall I make some coffee?
Wha, hmm?
Oh, no thank you.
Come on.
Now what's the matter?
If you don't mind, I'd rather go in by myself.
If you don't mind, I found you and I'm going to deliver you personally.
That's not necessary.
There's no reward you know.
It's going to be a little difficult and I'd rather explain to Father O'Malley in me own way, and I can do that better when you're not around.
Okay.
But if you want my advice, you just tell him you've been a bad boy, you ran away from home, and you're sorry.
And if you want my advice, you'll go to church on Sunday, say you haven't been to Mass in 10 years, and that you're sorry.
Hello.
If you don't mind, I've come back.
But only temporarily.
Until me plans are more formulated.
Maybe you wouldn't mind letting me stay.
I'll be no bother to you.
Here Father, let's get out of these wet clothes and get you up to bed huh?
But I don't expect me old room, that's yours now.
Oh I haven't moved in there yet.
No no, I insist, that's your room.
I'll sleep on the cot, anywhere.
I'll not even be bothering you for me food.
I'll eat out.
We'll talk about that later.
Mrs. Carmody will bring you something on a tray.
No no no no, I'm not a bit hungry, I...
Come on now Father, just a wee snack.
I've been keeping it for you on the stove.
Nice juicy cut of roast beef, Yorkshire pudding, and there were some creamed onions too huh?
And some asparagus with buttered breadcrumbs.
Golden brown potatoes and a nice cup of coffee.
Well if you insist, just a small portion of everything.
I hope it wasn't too much trouble for you, Mrs. Carmody.
No trouble at all, Father.
I feel I ought to help you with the dishes.
Don't worry about the dishes.
Isn't much washing they'll be needing.
Say, you're still a little cold Father, you were drenched to the skin.
You oughta take a little something to warm you up.
Do you have a wee drop of the creature about?
Matter of fact, I might have a little one with you.
I was out myself tonight.
I went out for a paper.
Ah, well in that case.
I'll ask Mrs. Carmody where she keeps it.
No no no no, look yonder in the bookcase.
Oh.
No no, other side.
No down, down.
You'll find it behind The
Life of General Grant.
Bit of ol' Ireland huh?
Every Christmas since I left, my old mother sends me one of these.
With a degree of abstinence it becomes me calendar.
I get a little behind during Lent, but it comes out even at Christmas.
That's me mother.
She's very beautiful.
Of course that was taken some time ago.
She's 90 now.
Let's drink to your mother.
Hope you'll be seeing her soon, Father.
What about your mother?
Well I don't remember much about her.
She died when I was quite young.
Well.
Let's drink to the two of them anyway.
Thank you, Father.
You know, Father O'Malley?
I always planned that as soon as I got a few dollars ahead, I'll go back to the old country and see my mother.
Would you believe it?
That was 45 years ago.
And every time I get a few dollars ahead...
There's always somebody that seems to need it more than you do.
Aye, you'd like her.
She'd like you too.
She always had a song in her heart.
I can almost hear her now.

Everybody right home and to bed!
Get a lot of rest!
I'm responsible for ya.
Don't forget we got a rehearsal in the morning huh?
Oh gee Father, ain't you coming with us?
No, I think I'll walk home alone.
I wanna think about my sermon for Sunday.
Has to be an extra special one for your parents.
Oh good.
On how to bring up children.
Oh Father, good luck to you!
Good luck Father!
Chuck.
Gennie.
Chuck, it's good to see you.
Well it's good to see you too.
Where were you going Gennie?
To work, and I'm late.
Come along.
What are you doing here?
This is the Metropolitan.
This is where I work!
Wait a minute, isn't that Carmen?
Huh?
What do you play?
One of the spectators at the bullfight?
Believe it or not, I'm Carmen.
Gennie Tuffle, Carmen?
Oh I've changed that.
It's Genevieve Linden.
I was singing Carmen in Rio and they heard me and said would you sing it here.
Here, can you imagine?
Gennie Tuffle at the Metropolitan.
Imagine that.
Well Chuck, make yourself comfortable.
I have to be getting on.
Oh it's good to see you Chuck.
Come on Effie, I'm terribly late.
I don't know why I'm even talking to you!
No?
Why didn't you write?
I did write.
I know you did, but why did you stop?
Didn't I tell you?
No you didn't.
But you're going to.
Gennie.
Please, I want to ask you just a small favor.
Hello Tommy, what is it?
Tonight, would you be so good as to glance occasionally at my baton?
Tonight, let's not race, let's try just for once to finish together huh?
All right Tommy, I promise.
And Tommy, do me a favor.
Meet Chuck O'Malley.
He's a very old friend of mine.
Chuck, Senor Tomaso Bozanni.
Father.
Chuck?
She always calls me that.
You haven't told me yet Chuck.
Why did you stop writing?
I did tell you in my last letter.
Which letter was that?
Guess that must've been the letter you didn't get.
You wrote to me in Rome, in Florence.
Naples, Vienna, Budapest.
Then I went to Switzerland and I found one of your letters waiting for me in Luzzone.
Oh you should've been there, Chuck.
It was a week before Christmas.
There was a quaint little post office.
I walked up to it in the snow.
The moon was so bright that I read your letter on the way home.
And I answered it that night.
But that letter in Luzzone was the last one I got.
From there I went to South America.
There were no more letters.
What happened Chuck?
Chuck, what hap...
Father Chuck.
It'll take me a little while to get used to that.
Where's your parish, Father?
I'm over here at St. Dominic's.
About 10 blocks from here.
Remember Timmy?
Tim O'Dowd?
Yes, of course I do.
He's at St. Francis now, he's a priest too.
Dear ol' Timmy.
Can you imagine that?
Well I'll have to be running along.
Oh please, please don't go.
Tommy, he can stand in the wings can't he?
It would be a privilege.
Please.
You know, Tommy?
Father O'Malley was the first one to tell me I could sing.
Maybe one day I'll tell her the same thing.
If she listens to you
Father, maybe you could persuade her to listen just once to me.
Watch the baton.
Good luck, Miss Tuffle.
You wanted to see me Father?
Yeah, yeah.
Mrs. Quimp here, good woman that she is, has come here with a bit of disturbing information.
I think it should more properly be brought to your attention.
That's nice work Mrs. Quimp, what is it?
Suppose you tell Father
O'Malley in your own words.
You better tell him, Father.
Huh?
Well your little songbird who was without funds, but not a bit interested in general housework, is fitting a nest in her own manner.
And if Mrs. Quimp's observations are correct, a very fine manor it is.
It seems, Father O'Malley, that the young lady in question has an apartment directly across the street.
Opposite Mrs. Quimp's bedroom.
And according to Mrs.
Quimp, young Ted Haines comes early and stays so late that...
Mrs. Quimp is losing a lot of sleep.
It's queer isn't it, Father?
Young Haines was ready to throw me out without so much as a how do you do.
But when it comes to this young "lady," and mark you, there are other words
I could call her, he acts quite different.
Don't you think it's strange?
That's a question.
People do funny things you know.
Father O'Malley.
It's as plain as the nose on your face.
The nose on whose father Father?
Well it doesn't matter whose face it's on.
You and I have got to face it.
Excuse us.
This is very suspicious, Father O'Malley.
As you're more familiar with the case,
I think you should handle it.
I handle the little sins.

Come in!
Hello Father.
Hello Carol.
Hi Father.
Hello.
I heard you.
That's more like it.
Thank you, Father.
Maybe it's because I'm putting more meaning into the words.
Very nice here isn't it?
Very nice.
Now before you go any further Father...
You mean it's all in my mind?
That's right.
Yes, I'm sure Father is just dying to hear more of the details.
Huh?
Yes.
Won't you sit down?
Mmmhm.
Well I was going down the street, and minding my own business too, when who do you think just happened by, purely by accident of course, and pulled up alongside of the curb?
Ted Haines Jr.
Right.
And what do you think his approach was?
You tell him.
I prefer not to remember.
Well being a woman, I do.
His exact words were "Hey good looking, what's cooking?"
Aw now wait a minute.
What I really said was "Who do you know that I know?"
You know that's worse?
Well...
Well that was that, and with practically no more of a buildup than that, he asked me to lunch.
Who knows, it might have worked.
It's been known to.
So after I'd cooled him off I came back here, no job, no money, expecting to be thrown out any minute.
There was a knock on the door and I said to myself the landlord, here it comes.
And who do you think was there?
Junior?
Right.
I was so surprised.
So was I.
Well up to here we're all surprised.
Naturally before throwing me out he had to know a little about me.
So in a few well chosen sentences I gave him the details.
Sorta like I told you.
And you found a landlord with a heart of gold.
Well not exactly a heart of gold Father, but well we had the apartment vacant and it seemed a shame to throw her out.
Well anyway, what's wrong with that?
Nothing that I know of up to here.
Well as I was saying, it was a shame to throw her out.
Like Mrs. Quimp?
Yeah.
No!
Well that's different.
I can see that obviously.
Look Father, she told me about coming to see you and that you wanted to help her.
You don't have a corner on helping people do you?
And besides, I've practically got her lined up in a job.
Yes, and soon as I get it
I'm going to pay him back.
Every nickel of it.
And you too, Father.
Don't worry about me.
Rather a nice looking piano you have here.
Well she needs one doesn't she?
She's gotta practice, she's a singer.
That's very thoughtful.
Course pianos are a little expensive these days.
Well I asked her first if she can play a ukulele.
Well then naturally.
Yeah, naturally.
Carol tells me you can play, Father.
How about trying this one out and see if I got a good buy.
Yes, play something for us, Father.
Would you mind us asking you a few questions, Father?
No.
Where'd you get that wicked left hand?
Well I've always been interested in music.
Used to write a bit of it at school.
Had a little band, I used to play for the school dances.
O'Malley's Orioles.
You know, at one time I had quite a decision to make.
Whether to write the nation's songs or go my way.
Any regrets, Father?
Regrets?
No.
I get a great happiness out of helping people realize that religion doesn't have to be this.
Taking all the fun out of everything.
Can be bright.
Bring you closer to happiness.
You go to church Ted?
Well...
Would you rather I change the subject?
If I could just express musically what I have in my mind, it would be much more eloquent.
Sound simpler than be remembered.
Sometimes the spoken word can be pretty dull.
You mean sing your sermons, Father?
Yeah, sorta.
Have you ever had anything published?
No, no.
Will you play us one of your unpublished ones?

Goodbye Carol.
Goodbye Ted.
Bye Father.
Nice thought.
Going my way.
Isn't it Ted?
He's quite a fella.
Good morning, Father.
I'd like to present Miss Genevieve Linden.
Gennie, this is Father Fitzgibbon.
Good morning, Father.
How do you do?
She's a singer.
Huh?
Ah.
Looking for work?
Oh no, no, Father.
She sings at the Metropolitan Opera House.
Well now, it's a great privilege to meet you, Miss Linden.
You've come quite a ways in the world huh?
Well I...
Travel extensively?
Yes, quite a bit.
Ah, well where's your home?
Well I just bought a home in Long Island.
Well, a nice home?
Very lovely.
In that care undoubtedly you'd be interested in a crazy quilt, we're raffling it off.
Again?
We're trying to raise a little money, Father O'Dowd.
I see.
How many?
I'll take them all.
How much are they?
Be $10.
Thank you.
And I hope you win this one.
Thank you.
And I hope you win it too, Gennie.
Then perhaps you'll donate it to our church.
And we can raffle it off over there all over again.
Oh I'd hate to see that crazy quilt leaving the parish.
Where's the Pied Piper and his merry little men?
Down in the basement.
Thank you, Father.
Come Gennie.
Goodbye Father.
Goodbye, thank you.
Congratulations on selling all your tickets.
Like some more?
Mmmhm.
You're our first audience you know.
Ready boys?
That's the best.
Course we have our more serious side.
Would you like to hear the boys sing something nice?
Something with a little more beauty?
Yes, very much.
That was very well done boys.
That's all.
Thank you so much.
See you all tomorrow huh?
They're angels.
They've got something you lose when you get older.
What's the matter Timmy?
Nothing, nothing.
That was beautiful, Chuck.
Beautiful.
Of course we don't get
Miss Genevieve Linden of the Metropolitan down here every day.
Nor deems O'Dowd either.
Oh now wait a minute, wait a minute.
I'm glad to see you kept up your interest in music, Father.
Are you writing anything anymore?
Oh yes.
I have a little song here now that
Timmy's gonna take to a publisher.
A very good friend of his, and if he likes it that might be the answer to all our trouble.
I have bad news for ya.
I've been to the publisher, Chuck.
He wasn't interested.
Wouldn't even look at it.
Said they were loaded up.
May I see it?
So you're still in trouble.
Wouldn't even look at it huh?
Oh he glanced at it.
What'd he have to say?
"Schmaltz isn't selling this season."
Schmaltz?
And what are they buying?
Bafola.
No, I think they call it vafola.
Ah, vafola.
- Vafola.
- Vafola.
Boy I heard some of their song hits.
It was Hut-Sut Time on the Rillerah.
And then there was another one,
I couldn't even understand the words.
This fella lost his girl in Salt Lake City.
Then he goes on to say the altitude is 5,400 feet.
Interesting.
The average temperature 73.
The section is noted for gold, silver, copper grade, but that doesn't make any difference to this fella because he's lost his sugar.
Vafola.
Oh I know what vafola is.
It's...
What's the matter with that?
Not for me.
Can you imagine Beat Me Eight to the Bar by Daddy O'Malley?
Oh no.
I like this.
She's buying schmaltz.
Going My Way.
Will you autograph it for me?
All right.
Thank you.
Well I have to go now.
Father Tim, can I drop you off?
You can, thank you.
There you are.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
My pen, Father.
Oh, oh yes.
Good day.
Oh.
Yes?
Uh-huh.
Mmmhm.
Uh-huh.
Mmmhm.
Well who are you?
I want to have a talk with you, that's who I am.
Ooooh.
You must be his father.
How old are you?
I'm 18.
Well that's good.
Well.
Oh Ted!
Be right with you darling!
What?
Hello dad.
Where have you been for the past two weeks?
Well dad.
I've been in a blue Heaven dancing on a pink cloud.
She came in on a moonbeam.
That's a lie, I had you followed.
That wasn't cricket, dad.
When you were my age I didn't follow you around.
Everything I say kills her.
It kills me too.
Do you realize this is one of my apartments?
Oh yes, I had it redecorated.
And that's one of my robes.
Yes, I had it altered.
I'm going to like him.
Do you know I could have you thrown out of town?
Maybe I know something about her you don't know.
She was picked up on the street by the police.
Oh I know that.
Maybe we know something that you don't know.
We're married.
Married?
Oooh I'll have that annulled.
Uh-uh.
You can only get them annulled when they aren't right in the first place.
Ours was right.
We said something about
'til death do us part.
Remember?
Where were you married?
St. Dominic's, Father O'Malley.
O'Malley?
A secret marriage eh?
Well he's put his foot in it this time.
It wasn't a secret marriage dad, it was in all the papers.
I didn't see it.
Well you never get past the financial column.
Don't be impertinent.
Young woman, do you know how he's planning to support you?
You know he's quit his job.
That's all right.
I'll support him.
Sure, she's working.
You...
You'd live off your wife?
Well mother was a big help to you wasn't she?
Until you got on your feet.
That was entirely different.
I made something of myself.
Yes dad, you certainly have.
Look son.
My boy.
Have you no family pride?
Uh-uh.
No shame?
Nope.
You certainly slipped, my boy.
You've lost everything.
I don't think so dad.
I think I found something.
Mmmhm.
Well darling, I guess
I'd better get dressed.
I think I'm a failure as a father.
I don't think so.
Darling!
Where's my hat?
I'll get it.
You'll have to forgive the way we've been acting today, dad.
We were a little hysterical.
I guess we were both a little mad.
Well I'm mad too.
Quitting his job like that.
Running off and getting married.
I don't know, this younger generation doesn't seem to have any sense.
So long, sweetie.
God bless you.
Goodbye dad.
That plane you gave me did the trick.
When they found out about my 600 hours in the air they said okay bud, we want you in.
Well.
Be nice to her dad.
She'll grow on you.
Goodbye boy.
Well.
He's gone.
Dad.
Look Max.
Max.
Max, you just have to do this for me and I don't want any arguments about it.
I'm afraid we got all the songs we need, Father.
Our catalog is full.
Oh now, now, now wait a minute.
I've been through a lot of trouble to arrange this, so grab your hat, and a taxi, and get right over here.
Yes now!
This very minute!
If you don't, I'll put the Irish curse on you.
Goodbye Father.
That's Father O'Dowd, a friend of mine.
What did he want, a donation?
No.
Pal of his has got a song and he's plugging it.
And what a plug.
He's grabbed off the Metropolitan
Opera House with the full orchestra conducted by this fellow Tomaso...
Whatever his name is, the star
Genevieve Linden, and a choir of 30 voices.
All this fuss to put over a song written by a pal of his.
And they're waiting right now for us at the Met.
At the Metropolitan?

Well that's very good.
Wonderful.
You sang it great, Miss Linden.
Thank you.
That's a pretty good song you got there, Father.
Thank you.
I guess you oughta know.
You bet he does.
They say he's the sharpest little man in town.
Well now I'm embarrassed.
You mean to talk business?
The money?
Oh don't let that embarrass you.
We love it.
Well what I wanted to say is that although it's great, it's just as
I told you, Father, it's too good for us.
It's way over our head.
You see, it's not just the type of song that a guy would, pardon me Father, that a gentleman would croon to his babe, if you know what I mean.
It doesn't say enough, it hasn't got that...
Well it's just not for me.
I think you oughta try it out on someone who publishes higher class stuff.
Thanks.
Well I guess we better get back to the office.
You know Father, I could be wrong.
I hope I am.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Oh I'm sorry.
Well we tried.
You sang it beautifully, Gennie.
Boys, you did fine.
Not a single mistake.
Thank you, Father.
If that isn't good, I'll go in the real estate business.
I was going to ask you and the boys to sing a little more, but maybe you don't feel like it now.
They sing divinely.
And they look like Botticelli's angels.
Maybe a little something huh?
What do you think they'd like to hear boys?
The Mule.
Hmm?
The Mule.
The Mule?
Yeah.

Was that your song, Father?
Yes.
Well we'll take a flyer on that.
Did you hear that Timmy?
Max!
You're a grand lad.
I knew your name wasn't golden for nothing.
Fellas, if you'll come to St. Dominic's tomorrow morning at 10:30...
Church?
Oh now Max, a day in church isn't gonna hurt you that much.
Be there and bring the cash with you.
Father O'Malley will tell you how he wants it paid.
An old man, very dear friend of
Father O'Malley's, is involved in this.
Father Fitzgibbon.
It would make Father
O'Malley very happy if you fellas would, you know, just do this his way.
Church.
As you know, I've been here for 45 years.
46 in October.
And during that time, I've always asked you to be generous.
Which you have.
And now I have to ask you again.
You all know how I feel about St. Dominic's.
Well we're in dire financial straits.
So give what you can.
And I know, I know that whatever you give, whether it's large or small, the good Lord will bless you for it.
In the name of the Father,
Son, the Holy Ghost.
Amen.
Gratifying.
Very gratifying.
And the bishop thought I couldn't preach.
Thought I had a mouthful of clover.
I wish he'd been here.
Father, now that you're practically wallowing in wealth, you suppose
I could have a half a dollar?
What for, what for?
Well Father O'Dowd and I thought, with your permission, we'd play a little golf tomorrow.
I need a new gold ball.
If I lose it I'll swear off, I'll quit.
Take 50 cents.
No no no, take it out of the.
They never keep any books.
Suppose I could buy
Father O'Dowd one too?
Must we?
I can get two nice repaints for 50 cents.
Give him 50 cents.
You oughta come along with us, Father.
You don't have to play.
Just go around.
The fresh air will do you good.
You can be our.
Your what?
What's...
Sorta an over the shoulder quarterback.
Will you come?
Well a little fresh air might do me good.
We'll get a ball for you too.
Of course.
Plenty mushrooms around here.
Well now where did that go?
Right there.
Now let me understand.
If you get the ball in the hole in this hit, then Father O'Dowd...
I win.
So you've gotta count the number of blows.
That's right Father.
Step aside, he's gonna play now.
Careful.
How many did you have?
Three huh?
How many?
Well that's remarkable.
Remarkable.
Can you do that every time?
Oh I've been known to miss, Father.
A strong crosswind or something.
Here, give me a hold of that.
You wanna try it?
Yeah.
Better throw a ball in there for you.
There you are.
Keep your head down now, Father.
Watch your language.
Father, you holed out!
Not bad for a beginner huh?
Oh you've played before.
Oh no no, believe me, that's the first time I ever had a caddy in me hand.
Well you better play in our watch then huh?
Well I guess I better be going.
Let that be a lesson to you, Father.
Don't trust anyone.
What an extraordinary person.
Isn't he?
Well I'll sleep well tonight anyway.
It must be that golf. you know, I feel 10 years younger.
You know I was thinking Father, now that everything is going so right, before something goes wrong, you oughta take a little time off.
To do what for instance?
Well like for instance take a trip home and see your mother.
Interest is all paid up to date.
If something goes wrong, I have plans that'll take care of the next payment.
You really think it would be all right?
I mean it would yeah?
Father Fitzgibbon,
Chuck, the church is afire!
Don't worry, Father.
We'll build again.
Can I help you Father?
No, it's all right, I can manage.
This is for the birds.
They're used to coming here.
I don't want them to go away.
No.
Oh you see Father?
They're not leaving.
Nobody's leaving here.
And when your church is rebuilt, they'll all be back.
Everyone will be back.
In the meantime you can send your congregation over to my parish.
I'll split the collection with you 50/50.
Take it, Father.
What makes you all so hopeful that the church will ever be rebuilt?
Here, you're supposed to take this.
No, no I cannot.
Come on, please Father, take it.
I tell you what, if you'll take it I'll take some too.
There, now that wasn't so bad.
Don't you try it.
Doctors, medicine, feh.
What I need is to be up and about.
Being up and about is what's got you down, tramping all over the parish trying to raise funds, and how much did you collect?
There's no need for you to rub it in.
Yeah.
How much is the doctor's bill?
Says here to take two now, we wanna get our money's worth, here.
Now listen, there's nothing in that bottle that's going to do me any good.
Oh Father, now you're not gonna lose hope are you?
Hope?
You know Chuck, when you're young it's easy to keep the fires of hope burning bright.
But at my age you're lucky if the pilot light doesn't go out.
I know, Father.
45 years of your efforts in ashes.
Here, take this.
That'll keep the pilot light burning.
Yes, it ought to.
Tastes like it had kerosene in it.
Well did you make your parish calls?
Oh yes.
Mrs. McGonagall's rheumatism is kicking up again.
I told her to bury a potato out in the backyard.
That's for warts.
That's what she said.
And I heard Mrs. Quimp's new gossip.
Oh what else?
And then I went to see
Carol and Mr. Haines.
Oh, did they hear from young Ted?
Young Ted has been wounded in Africa.
Ah, too bad.
They're shipping him home.
Find upstanding young fella.
Maybe they'll decorate him.
No, I doubt it.
Some friend of his ran over him in a jeep.
But I got some good news.
I have a letter from Miss Linden.
Miss Linden, well now, that's very nice.
Where is she?
She's in St. Louis.
And here it comes Father, I gave you that medicine to quiet your nerves.
Tony and the boys are with her.
They're on a concert tour.
They're on a what?
Now I had their parents' consent and they'll be back in time for school.
But you...
Besides, travel's a great education.
If they make enough money it's gonna build you a new church.
Not much of one maybe, but something to go on with.
Miss Linden sent you a check.
With her love.
How's the pilot light burning now?
It's burning brighter, Chuck.
It's a long road back, but we've started huh?
You know, I have a feeling the dawn may rise again.
Sure it'll rise again.
You know, I think I'll get up meself.
No no, now you better stay there and get some rest.
Rest, you're well, but not that good.
You don't feel near that good.
Hey now boys, boys, boys!
Go on, go on home, go on away with you now, your dinner's ready, go on go on go on.
Bye Father.
Goodnight.
Fine girl, Miss Linden.
Very thoughtful, very generous.
Close this up, keep the sawdust out hmm?
That will lend beauty to the dedication.
And at Christmas you and the choir will be able to...
Father, I won't be here at Christmas.
Huh?
Well I was with the bishop this afternoon.
He's transferring me to another parish.
You're leaving me.
Well now it never occurred to me that someday you might.
But me boy, what am I going to do without you?
You didn't ask to?
Oh no Father, as a matter of fact
I asked to stay with you, but the bishop asked me to help him out and I...
St. Dominic's, what's going to happen?
Well you'll be all right, Father.
I wish you could've heard some of the things the bishop said about you.
Would've done you good.
Says you're looking 10 years younger.
He has all the confidence in the world in you.
And don't worry, you'll have a new assistant
Well now I want you wish you all the success in the world, which I know you'll have.
Is it a perish of your own?
Well no, not exactly Father, you see this church, St. Charles, well the pastor's getting along in years and things aren't...
You mean they're in trouble.
Yes, and I'm supposed to go in there and try and help...
You mean without both of their knowing.
Uh-huh.
Well now that's a difficult assignment.
But it'll work out.
You may have trouble with the old man at first.
He may be running off to the bishop every few minutes.
But don't let that bother you.
You'll bring him around to your way of thinking.
Well there's dinner.
You'll know how to manage these old fuss buckets.
Take them out in the golf course.
Bring them out in the fresh air.
Yeah.
We'll get along just so he...
Knows enough to come in out of the rain.
That's it.
That's it Father, that's it exactly.
Come in, Tony.
Hi Father.
So you're really leaving us huh?
Yes, I've got my orders Tony.
I guess when the bishop says you gotta go, you gotta go.
That ain't hay huh?
That's right Tony.
You know, sometimes I think I don't like bishops.
Well Tony, bishops are like umpires.
You have to have them to call the close decisions.
Really?
Say, I got a little
Christmas present here for you.
I want you to take my place with the choir.
From now on, you're in charge.
That's swell of you, Father.
It's a great present.
I always had my eye on it.
I thought you did.
Say, when you gonna give
Father Fitzgibbon his surprise?
Shhh, not so loud.
Later on in the church.
Those boys haven't told anyone?
Not a word Father, not a word, and if they did I'd kick, er,
I mean I'd be disappointed in them.
Well I guess I'll get going, Father.
I know there's a lot on your mind, you wanted to tell me about taking your place with the gang and everything.
But I'll make it easy for you.
I'll be everything you want me to be.
Just as if you were here checking up on me.
And if you don't, I'm gonna drop you like you was a hot potato.
Okay Father, it's a deal.
Good luck to you.
Good luck to you.
So long, Father.
So long.
Pretty near Christmas.
Yeah.
I'm sure that the way to say what I'd like to say will occur to me after you've gone.
We're separated by many years, Father O'Malley.
Which could be the reason why we haven't seen eye to eye in many instances.
But though we've had many differences, we never differed in fundamentals.
It was only in method.
But never in our hearts.
Good stuff huh?
Oh yes.
Bye Ted.
Bye Father.
Bye Carol.
Right man did come along.
Yes, but not past our house.
Stubborn huh?
Goodbye, Mr. Haines.
Father.
Pardon me, Mr. Haines.
I've just left the bishop.
He told me to report to Father Fitzgibbon.
I'm taking your place.
I'm the new curate.
Come on, come on, you've very little time.
They're waiting in the church to say goodbye.
All right Father, I've been doing you a lot of good here.
You're gonna have a new church after the war.
Yes, but we didn't raise enough money.
That's just it.
Mr. Haines is gonna give us a mortgage.
Take care of the difference.
That's right, Father.
He convinced me I have a heart.
And after all, it wouldn't be a church without a mortgage.
That's right, that's right.
He's a wonder.
I don't know what I'm going to do without him.
I don't know who the bishop is going to send in his place, but whoever he is...
Father.
Right behind you, Father O'Dowd.
Congratulations to you, Father.
The bishop wouldn't do that to me again.
Yes he's done it.
Mr. Haines.
Nice of you to give that mortgage to the church.
Oh not a problem.
Can't tell you how much we appreciate it.
As you know, we're all going to miss Father O'Malley.
He was a fine man.
This is Father O'Malley.
The man who sent for you.
How do you do, Mrs. Fitzgibbon?
I've heard so much about you.
Now it's good to see you.
I think you'll agree with me that we're all a little better for having known him.
He was always thinking of others.
And that, you know, can make life very beautiful.
Believe me, it's what we do for others that...

1929, yes sir, that was quite a year.
Mister Hoover was President.
There was a chicken in every pot and two cars in every garage.
That was the year that Admiral Byrd planted our flag over the South Pole.
But on other poles a new form of exercise was capturing the national fancy.
Flag pole sitters.
Remember?
Bobby Jones lost the amateur title that year.
Gene Tunney made news by quoting Shakespeare.
And Red Grange was still a national item.
But the big heartthrob along the Middle West flapper circuit that year was an up and coming young band leader named Chuck Arnold.
His silver megaphone and golden smile rustled the pages of many a moonstruck diary from Kokomo, Indiana to Keokuk, Iowa.
And, on a certain September night, in Bloomington, Illinois,
# Can't sleep a wink. #
# Can't seem to think. #
# It's something I just can't explain. #
# What is this hoodoo, this mystical voodoo... #
# That's haunting and taunting my brain? #
# Here's the rhythm, here's the doorway,
I'll go my way, you go your way. #
# Crazy rhythm, from now on, we're through. #
# Here is where we have a showdown #
# I'm too high hat,
You're too lowdown #
# Crazy rhythm, here's goodbye to you. #
# They say that when a highbrow meets a lowbrow #
# walking along Broadway #
# Soon the highbrow, he has no brow #
# Ain't it a shame and you're to blame #
# What's the use of prohibition #
# You produce the same condition #
# Crazy rhythm, I'm goin' crazy too #
Okay, kids. Okay, this is it, this is what you're waiting for.
Somebody's big moment.
The lucky number drawing.
Hold your breath and hold your checks.
In just a minute we'll know who's got the lucky number.
The drawing tonight will feature my manager and brilliant arranger, from Green Perk, weighing 170 lb., mostly gristle,
Mr. Oscar Hoffman.
To think I gave up a concert career for this.
What a disgusting way of making a living.
If my old piano teacher should see me now... he'd turn over in his Turkish bath.
Draw, Oscar.
And the lucky number is... number 864.
864, who's got it?
864, who's the lucky lady?
Don't be bashful, step up!
I know somebody's got it.
Who's the lucky lady?
- What's your number, Peggy?
That's it. It's you!
Here, here, she's got it.
Hey, she's got it!
There she is.
Step this way, miss.
Well, fortune smiles on a lovely lady.
And your name, miss, is...
- Mayhew, Peggy.
- Miss Peggy Mayhew.
Now, let's see what we have here.
First we have from Bahm's Department Store... one book of green trading stamps.
A little applause on that one, don't you think, fellas?
And, from Brock's Drugstore, we have a jar of Blush Face Cream.
Smells like er...
Smells like Blush Face Cream.
There you are. That goes with it.
And from Weavel's Lingerie Shop, a very feminine little article here...
Yes, very daring, very uh...
Hm, yes, very.
There you are. That does it.
How about that?
Let's put these right over here.
I'll just put them on the piano.
Now, in honor of Miss Mayhew, the boys and I would like to do a special arrangement of a little tune titled
'You Were Meant for Me.'
# You were meant for me #
# I was meant for you #
# Nature patterned you #
# And when she was done #
# You were all the sweet things #
# Rolled up in one #
# You're like a plaintive melody #
# That never lets me free #
# For I'm content #
# The angels must have sent you #
# And they meant you #
# Just for me #
You're beautiful you know it?
Oh, thank you.
My folks will be pleased.
Can I have my hand back, please?
Don't go yet.
How about a prize for me?
Prize?
Something to remember you by.
Wait a minute, baby.
You can't do that and then just walk out of my life.
Please, everybody's looking.
You should have thought of that before you kissed me.
Now I'm compromised.
Why don't we just talk this thing over?
But I'm...
I'm with a boy.
- Ditch him.
- Oh, I can't.
Well, point him out to me.
I'll ditch him.
No, please, you mustn't.
We'll probably go for chop suey after the dance.
It's Ah Sing's, on Main Street.
Where is that joint?
Ah Sing's, on Main Street.
Chop Suey place, Ah Sing's.
# You're like a plaintive melody #
Dreamy night, isn't it?
Nothing personal.
# That never lets me free #
Hey, Peggy!
How do you like those swell prizes?
When the heart is impetuous the head must be cautious.
Oh, Eddy, you're just making that up.
No, that's what it says.
- I wonder who thinks up those things.
- They're supposed to be sayings by Confucius.
They're sayings by the Hong Kong
Noodle Company.
Well, look who's here.
The great Chuck Arnold in person.
Well, what do you think?
What can I say after I say I'm sorry?
How do you like the band?
Unfortunately they're doing their best.
Shrimp with lobster sauce.
Lobster with shrimp sauce.
That seems fair enough.
Oh!
Excuse me.
My!
Well, this is a pleasant surprise.
- Yes, isn't it?
- Must be my lucky day.
- Mr. Arnold, these are my friends...
- Pleased to meet you.
Could I have this dance?
That is, if your friends don't mind.
Oh, they don't mind.
I never saw a man so indifferent to women.
Hiya, beautiful.
A face that lost a thousand ships.
Don't the people in this town stand in the corners and just... wait for you to go by?
That's big time rollers you've got there, baby.
Man, what goes on behind those baby blue eyes?
They're hazel.
They're looking blue in this light.
They're the dangerous kind.
They change color with every dress you put on, I bet.
I don't know.
I've never studied them.
It's time somebody did.
I want to make a survey of the whole subject.
Come on, let's get out the back way.
Please, Chuck, I can't.
You're not gonna give me a sad story about that kid you're with, are you?
He looks like something left over from a bum town rummage sale.
Don't say that.
He's nice, and he's loyal... and he's waited a whole month to take me out tonight.
I'd wait a month, too, only I can't.
I've got a calendar by the tail.
I'm sorry, but I just can't.
- You mean you really don't want to.
- Oh, I do.
Maybe more than you do.
It's just that...
Oh, I can't walk out on Roy.
It's not fair.
Suppose you let him take you home.
Could I meet you somewhere afterwards?
It would be too late.
You sure make things difficult.
It's not me.
It's different for you, Chuck.
You'll go away tomorrow.
Probably never even come back to Bloomington again.
But I have to live here.
With my family and my friends.
You mean this is it?
I just don't see you again.
I don't see how.
Not unless the committee votes to have play at the dance again next year.
Chuck, I'd really better be getting back to the table.
I wouldn't want them to feel hurt.
- Them? How about me?
- Oh, you'll get over it.
You know, another town, another lucky number.
Will I?
Won't you?
Look, we play Peoria tomorrow night.
It's close by.
Why don't you come over there?
Alone.
I'll try.
I don't know, I...
I just got to get back to the people.
Golly, Roy. I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.
Gee whiz, did you have to kiss him, Peggy?
On the bandstand, right in front of everybody.
I didn't mean to.
Something just came over me, I...
I couldn't help it.
Funny it never comes over you when I'm around.
No, that's true, Roy.
Well, good night.
I had a lovely evening.
- Thank you very much.
- Don't mention it.
Roy... if uh... if you'd like to kiss me...
Gee, Peggy.
Good night, Peggy.
Good night, Roy.
No voltage.
I understand we're quite the celebrities in town today.
Oh, mother, don't start that again.
I don't know. Somehow it seems to me every time you go to see Clara Bow you get into trouble.
What happened, princess?
Your daughter made quite a spectacle of herself last night.
Oh, mother, you're just making a big fuss over nothing.
Nothing?
In my day kissing the conductor was hardly considered nothing.
Conductor? On what line?
Oh, Dad!
Chuck Arnold merely happens to be the most popular band leader in the country.
I don't care if he's John Philip Souza.
Kissing a man in public is something nice girls don't do.
Mother, sometimes I think you're still living in the moles' decade. ???
From the way you young people carry on
I'm glad I'm not living today.
I'll get it.
Hello!
Oh, yes, Mrs. Hauser.
Yes.
No, we've finished.
Hm-hmm. All right, I'll tell her.
Goodbye
It was Mrs. Hauser, Mom.
She said the meeting's all ready to start.
Don't worry about the dishes, Mom,
I'll take care of them.
Why, thank you, dear.
This is very sweet of you.
- Are you sure you're feeling all right?
- I feel fine.
Now run along.
Have a nice evening.
- Bye-bye.
- Oh, Andrew.
You might take your nose out of those stamp albums long enough to help Peggy dry the dishes.
Not at all, my dear.
You run along and enjoy yourself.
It wouldn't hurt you to get to bed early tonight.
You were up very late last night.
Yes, Mother.
Good bye, dear.
Well, the dishes are all done, Dad.
I think I'll go out for a while.
Hm?
I said I think I'll go out for a while.
Oh...
Well, where to?
Just to the bus station.
What for?
I'm going to Peoria.
Oh, that's nice.
Peoria?
One, please.
Somebody with you, young lady?
Well, no. I'm alone.
I'm sorry, but we don't admit ladies without escorts.
Well, you see, Chuck...
Mr. Arnold's expecting me.
I know. He's expecting a lot of people.
But I can't let you in without an escort.
Sorry, that's the rule.
- Oh, hello!
- Hello.
You get around, don't you?
Would you do me a favor?
- What, for instance?
- Would you take a note to Mr. Arnold?
Mr. Arnold doesn't read very well.
Oh, Please.
Okay, but you'd be better off at home with a good book.
Even a bad book.
You look like an intelligent girl.
Why don't you take in a nice right movie?
They're playing Midnight Madness with Clive Brook right down the block.
Please. I came all the way from Bloomington.
Okay. I'll deliver it right after this set.
You'd better wait outside.
Young America.
All the way from Bloomington.
You know what?
I'm gonna do that kid a favor.
Save the looks. I've got a hot copy of Spinoza's ethics up in my room.
All she'd ever get out of Arnold is a one night stand and a big hangover.
She's a nice kid.
She doesn't look the part.
Could be your sister... if you were better looking.
Oscar said we set another house record tonight.
What do you say about that, Chuck?
Yeah, Chucky boy is blasé about house records.
Chucky Boy is all hot and bothered about that corn-fed Desdemona...
- ...that didn't show up.
- Yeah.
Hey, what about a hot cup of coffee?
Hello, beautiful.
- You look like a mouthful of sunshine.
- I feel like a wet dish rag.
Did something go wrong at home?
I thought you weren't coming.
I've been here all evening.
I'm waiting for a bus.
Why were you waiting for a bus?
- They wouldn't let me in without an escort.
- Why didn't you let me know?
I did!
I sent you a note.
I didn't get any note.
Oh, Oscar.
Oh, gee, I'm sorry, honey.
I'll make it up to you.
- Would you like something to eat?
- I can't. I've got to get home.
The last bus is due any minute.
You're not gonna start that line again, will you? You just got here.
I mean, I just got here.
I'm sorry, but I'll get it as it is for staying out this late.
There's my bus now!
My bus!
It's gone.
Don't worry, baby.
I'll get you home.
You'll have a bus all for yourself.
Oh, I don't care.
Chuck, I thought I was never going to see you again.
How do you think I felt?
Come on, honey.
We got a lot of time to make up for.
I think I'd better call home then.
They'll be worried about me.
There's a drugstore right over here.
This is it.
It's called the Inspiration Point.
We come here on picnics.
Aw, and I forgot the marshmallows.
Do you care?
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Yeah, beautiful.
Peggy, what a face.
You always talk about my face.
Anybody can have a face.
Not like yours they can't.
Your hands are cold.
And you're shivering.
It's nothing.
I just got a little chill.
Do you have any hooch?
- Any what?
- Hooch, you know, whiskey.
Yeah, I know. Just sounded kinda funny coming from you.
- Why?
- I don't know.
Guess you're not the hooch type.
Anyway, it's kind of a funny word, hooch.
Hey, take it easy.
That stuff packs a wallop.
It is strong, isn't it?
- Is it just off the boat?
- Yeah, scraped off.
Then I add a little wood alcohol and some extract of apricot.
That's powerful, isn't it?
Nah, not for an old-timer like you.
Take another slug.
Come on, button your eye.
Button your eye.
What an act! You never had a drink before in your life, did you?
- Uh-hum.
- Then what's the idea of starting with me?
Who are you trying to kid?
I'm just trying to be a good sport, Chuck.
That's what you want, isn't it?
How do you know what I want?
Maybe that's just what I don't want.
Baby, I've had enough good sports to last me the rest of my life.
Maybe I'd like a girl that slaps a guy's face when he gets fresh.
What makes you think you know what I want?
Your manager even tried to warn me off...
Oh, that's fine.
Great.
What am I supposed to be,
Svengali or Blue Beard??
You're supposed to be Prince Charming,
And you might try being a little more charming.
You might try using your bean.
You're gonna get yourself in a lot of trouble... trying to act like a red-hot mama.
- You're just a kid.
- I know what I'm doing.
That's what you think.
Suppose I was somebody else tonight.
Suppose I...
But you're not somebody else, Chuck.
That's why I'm here.
You're a funny kid, Peggy.
I'm dippy about you.
I'm dippy about you too, Chuck.
I have been for a long time.
Oh, Chuck, I love you.
Whatever happens tonight or afterwards...
I'll always be glad just being with you.
That's fine.
But I'm taking you home.
Andrew, get up!
Huh?
Peggy, is she home?
She's downstairs on the sofa asleep with a man.
- A man? What man?
- How should I know?
Oh, a stranger.
- Say, Cora...
- Will you get up!
And come downstairs and stop acting like an idiot.
Yes, of course, right away.
Maybe someone from Peoria.
Don't just stand there!
Do something!
So sound asleep.
They must have come in very late.
Wake up!
Young man!
- Hm...
- Young man, wake up!
Hello, mother.
Dad.
Oh...
Oh.
Peggy, I want to know the meaning of this at once.
There's no hurry, Cora.
Yes, mother.
This is Chuck. Chuck Arnold.
We were going to a hotel for the night, but I thought you might worry.
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
- Chuck and I were married last night.
- Oh!
Oh... married.
This is kind of sudden, for instance.
Yes, I know, Dad.
It did all happen sort of suddenly.
It happened kinda sudden to me too but I seem to be a lot happier about it.
It's not that we're not happy, it's just that...
I guess we'd all be a lot happier if we had some breakfast, huh?
That's a good idea... Pop
Now, Cora, we got married once ourselves.
It didn't seem to do us much harm.
I'm not saying it did do anybody any harm.
But I have a right to cry at my own daughter's wedding, haven't I?
Mrs. Mayhew, I know we didn't do this thing according to file... but we couldn't, see, we didn't have time.
Believe me, I love Peggy.
Right down to my shoes.
Which one?
Oh...
I'll make some coffee.
Peggy, you can go down and get out one of those jars of plum preserves we put up last year.
And Andrew, take Chuck upstairs and show him where he can wash.
And don't detour him to those stamp albums.
Run along, son.
What's the idea, Chuck, where have you been?
Eleven o'clock.
We've got time to burn.
Boys, I want you to meet Peggy.
Peggy, this is Billy,
Boss, trombone,
Tiny, bass, Joe, second trombone,
Harry, piano... and all the rest of them double on the hot comb.
You know him, this is Oscar, our manager.
Rigged my stuff two hours ago.
- Hey, ditch the babe, will you?
- Quiet!
Come on, boys, let's get started.
We gotta play Tahoe tonight.
It's all right, we're gonna make it.
Say, Harry, do you know what happened to my horns?
- They're up on top.
- Pull over, will you, Tiny.
- What's the idea, this is my seat.
- I know, but just pull over.
Come on, step back here.
Look, sister, we gotta get going.
Haven't you got a home?
I forgot to tell you.
Peggy's coming with us.
- Oh, no, you're kidding.
- Yeah, we got married last night.
Well, isn't anybody gonna say anything?
They'd better not.
# I'm content #
# the angels must have sent you #
# and they meant you just for me. #
# This old world was just a sadder place for me as could be #
# I was lonely and blue. #
# This old world then changed to paradise for me, suddenly. #
# Why, because I met you. #
# Although wealth and power
I may never find, #
# still, as long as I have you here,
I won't mind, #
# for... #
# I'll get by #
# as long as I have you. #
# though there be rain #
Getting impatient?
Oh, no. I could watch him all night.
This is fun.
- You like it?
- I adore it.
Crowds, dancing.
It's like being in a party every night.
Who could ask for anything more?
You're a lucky girl, Peggy.
It's gonna be one great party, night after night, after night.
# ...may come to me, that's true #
# But what can I say? #
# I'll get by
# as long as I #
# have you. #
# Yes, I'll get by #
# as long as I #
# have you. #
- Hold it steady.
- Salami?
I wouldn't eat salami if you paid me.
- I got it!
There's a winner right there.
Step this way.
The young America.
History in the making.
You don't have to stand here and watch this gruesome display of individualism.
You're such a big faker, Oscar.
You know you love it.
Love it? Sure. Red hot mamas and their fat house sugar daddies.
Hot shots with hip flasks passing out in the men's room.
Music that has all the charms of a rubber plunger in a tub of sour milk.
You know what , if it was me,
I'd rather be married to a plumber.
I think it would be more fun that way.
Maybe. But I didn't fall in love with a plumber.
I fell in love with Chuck.
Do you mind if I fall in love with you a little?
- In a nice way, of course.
- Why, Oscar, what a sweet thing to say.
Okay, don't rub it in.
It was a moment of unbridled sentiment.
You're so funny.
You're really an awfully sweet person.
Just so afraid of letting people find it out. Why?
Sometime I'll tell you the story of my life.
It's short, but dull.
Eventually?
Why not now?
Because your husband doesn't pay me to sit around and spin my autobiography.
I gotta go and shovel some gaggle sticks.
I still think you'd be better off in a movie.
They're playing 'Forbidden Hours', with Ramon Novarro, down the block.
Hey, here's another plug for us this week.
'Arnold Combo sets new house record.
Chuck Arnold and his Sophisticates garnering top grosses on the Midwest flapper circuit.'
- Pretty good, huh?
- It's wonderful, Chuck.
- Pretty soon you'll be on the front page.
Pretty soon you'll be buying clothes at Hattie Carnegie's.
What clothes? You've bought me everything
I could possibly use for the next five years.
I don't know.
How about a nice hunk of mink to snuggle into in one of those chilly New York afternoons?
Chuck!
Are we going to New York?
Yeah, we're going to New York.
Why didn't you tell me?
When?
We're booked into the Pennsylvania Roof right after the 1st of the year.
- Oh, Pennsylvania Roof, honestly?
- The deal's practically wrapped up.
Except for a few little details
Oscar's working out.
Darling, I get all excited just thinking about it.
- Will you write in a hotel?
- If you want to.
Twenty floors up.
I'll buy you a little bean blower.
You can shoot out all the lights in Herald Square just for laughs.
The Pennsylvania Roof, now playing Chuck Arnold...
No, Chuck Arnold, now playing in the Pennsylvania Roof.
Oh, darling, I can see it now.
Won't that be something for the kids back home?
Darling, did you see this?
Oh, yeah.
Looks like the bucket shops are really having themselves a brawl, doesn't it?
- That reminds me.
- Chuck, is it anything bad?
Not if you're a bear.
What are we?
Well, I think at the moment we're a little bullish.
Get me Mr. Hoffman's room.
I'm just going to check with Oscar.
Oscar, hey, listen did you talk to New York about Amalgamated Wire?
No fooling, how much more do they want?
Oh...
Well, send it to them.
Sure, sure, don't let them spring us.
It's just a little flimflam to shake out the suckers.
Quit worrying. We've done alright up to now, haven't we?
Okay, well get on it.
Anything wrong?
Naw, just a little flooring of the market.
Don't give it a thought, honey.
I'm way ahead of them.
Come on, Peg.
Your old man's gotta get to work.
Get me one of those number 4 smiles out of the bottom drawer, will you?
I think those kids are gonna be kinda tough tonight.
Chuck, you go ahead.
Don't wait for me.
Yeah, I'll go ahead, I won't wait...
What do you mean, don't wait for you?
I have to finish my letter, and get dressed and...
- I'll be down later.
- Okay, but... don't write a book, will you?
- Would you get me my hat?
- Hm-hmm.
# I could be a king, dear, uncrowned #
# Humble or poor, rich or renowned #
# There is nothin' I couldn't do #
# If I had you #
- Hm!
- Do I look nice, Oscar?
Like Tiffany's window.
Something special?
- It's our anniversary.
- No fooling.
Hm-hmm. Two months.
Well, what do you know.
Through good times and bad.
- And you still love each other.
- More than ever.
His nibs, the idol of jazz age,
America's charm boy, your old man, does he know about this?
Not yet.
But will you take him a note?
- Do you think you can trust me?
- I think so.
We know each other a little better than we did two months ago.
You said a mouthful, baby.
If I knew then what I know now,
I would have written a note about you myself.
# Good night, sweetheart #
# till we meet tomorrow #
# Good night, sweetheart #
# sleep will banish sorrow #
# Dreams enfold you #
# and in each one I'll hold you #
# Good night, sweetheart #
# Good night. #
- Hey, Oscar. How's the take?
- Moving on the record.
Hello, beautiful.
You know, I ordered a diamond tiara, it just didn't come.
I'll forgive you, darling, if you don't forget our golden anniversary.
This calls for a celebration.
Let me get the boys, we'll all...
Darling.
Couldn't we go dancing alone?
Just the two of us.
Sure. I know just the place.
Somebody gave me a card, let me see...
I know I got it here.
Dear Chucky boy... No.
The Blue Goose on Highway 66.
Dining and dancing till 4 a.m.
How does that sound?
- Darling, I'd adore it.
- What are we waiting for?
Hold it, boys.
Don't put 'em away yet!
There's gold in them that frills.
How are ya, Arnold.
You remember me, Harry Jarvis.
Mills Publishing Company.
Mills will make you millions.
It's the biggest thing to hit the boards since Firpo bumped into Dempsey. and it's just your style, right down your alley.
And this is not a stock, it's a special and just for you.
When I told the arranger
I was coming down here, he opened up one of his veins and wrote it with his heart's blood.
Pure alcohol.
How are you, Oscar, glad to see ya.
You're gonna love this number, it's terrific.
You know, the trouble with us is... our book is loaded with ballads.
Now...
If we had a... I'll tell you.
You remember a tune we do called 'Crazy Rhythm'?
This is 'Crazy Rhythm', it's the same thing.
Look, Arnold, you haven't had a new number in a dog's age.
- Why don't you give it a try?
- Sure... sure...
Let's take all the parts.
Harry, on the piano.
What's a good tempo for this?
With a tune like this it doesn't make any difference.
Fast, slow, loud, soft, doesn't...
- Go ahead, Harry, give it to him.
- Harry, do it like this.
- One, two...
- That's good.
# No one to talk with, all by myself #

Great, Arnold, you were terrific!
You're gonna make a great wreck with that tune.
Thank you, fellas, that was wonderful.
Harry, put it in the book.
We'll play it just that way.
- How did you like it, Oscar?
- Grand!
You're gonna make a big wreck with your wife too.
- Really? Did she like it?
- She loves it. She's dippy about it.
- Really? Where is she?
- Right over there.
Isn't that sweet?
She's sleeping just like a little kid.
She's not a little kid. She's a woman.
And you married her, remember?
- Chucky boy. The eternal bachelor.
- What's eating you?
I heard you say you were gonna take her dancing at 12 o'clock.
- It's a quarter to three now.
- You're kidding.
Let me get my hat and coat.
I'll see ya.
Wake up, honey.
I wasn't asleep.
I just had my eyes closed.
It's a good idea.
Keeps the dust out of them.
I'm awful sorry, honey.
But we got started and I think I...
That's alright, darling. I know you have to keep up with the new tunes.
- What time is it?
- It's a quarter of three.
We can still go out there.
They're open till four.
Let's make it some other night.
Don't look so guilty, darling.
Just like Oscar said, if I wanted to go dancing,
I should have married a plumber.
He's quite a philosopher, Oscar.
What did you say?
I said I didn't fall in love with a plumber,
I fell in love with you.
You see, I'm quite a philosopher too.
Oh!
Peggy.
Peggy, what's the matter?
Nothing.
Honey, what is it?
Nothing, I guess I'm just tired.
It's alright,
I'm just being silly, really.
Come on, no secrets.
Tell me, what's the matter?
I... I guess I'm just lonely.
Miss your folks, huh?
I miss you, Chuck.
Me?
Honey, we're together practically 24 hours a day.
Yes, we're together all the time.
All that separates us is a bandstand and a million girls in party dresses.
Darling, I never even get to talk to you.
When you're not playing, you're rehearsing, and when you're not rehearsing, you're talking to Oscar or the boys.
When I'm awake, you're asleep. and when I'm ready for bed, you want to go out for chop suey or something.
By that time I'm so sleepy
I don't know what you're talking about.
Gee, honey, I never realized, but... playing and rehearsing, that's my job.
Oh, I know.
I'm not blaming you.
I...
I guess I just had a different idea of how it would be, married to you.
What do you want it to be like?
You want me to quit?
- Be a plumber?
- You know I wouldn't want that.
But if only we could be together sometimes.
Go for a walk, or for a ride, or on a picnic, just the two of us.
Not just...
Oh, I'm sorry,
- I'm just being a baby.
- No, honey...
I'm the one that's been a baby.
A spoiled brat.
Oscar's right, as usual.
He says I want all the privileges of marriage with all the prerogatives of bachelorhood.
Does that mean you don't care about spending time with your wife?
You wait, baby. I'll prove to you how different it can be.
It's just this crazy routine, batting around in the country.
Do you realize we spend half our lives in that darn bus?
Wait till we get settled in New York in a place of our own we can get used to.
No more hopping from one fleabag to the next.
We'll have all day to ourselves and Sundays we'll go places together and do things.
You'll see.
You'll have to think up excuses to get rid of me so you can have an afternoon for yourself.
Oh, Chuck, that sounds like heaven.
And I'm not waiting for New York.
I'm turning over a new leaf right now.
Let's see.
We play East Saint Louis tomorrow...
I'll call Oscar and have him make plans so we can spend all day Sunday in Des Moines.
That's on a river, we'll hire a boat and go out to one of those islands and spend the whole day.
- How does that sound for a start?
- Oh, darling, you're wonderful.
- Won't you have another hard-boiled egg?
- I don't mind if I do.
Being out in the air like this certainly does give one an appetite, doesn't it?
Don't you think you'd better put a little more cocoa butter on your nose?
I think not. The sun doesn't seem quite so strong now.
We could go wading.
I know, I'll teach you to swim.
Oh, no, you might get fresh.
Oh, look!
Flowers in November.
- What a lovely spot.
- Yes, it's full of spots.
Where is your imagination?
We're miles from civilization.
I've run out of all the handy quotations and now I'm getting down to brass tacks.
Come in.
Excuse me.
I must be in the wrong tenement.
Come on in, Oscar, we're just having a little picnic.
Yeah, I guess it has been.
Up till now.
What's eating you?
I'd better come back later.
These scenes of domestic bliss upset my metabolism.
You'd better get used to it, cause it's gonna get worse and worse as the years go by.
Anyway, I've no secrets from my wife.
I see calamity on your face, so speak up, old man.
Which of our selections ran out of what money for how much and where?
- Here. You can see for yourself.
- Excuse me, honey.
- Want a sandwich?
- No, thank you.
- I don't believe it.
- What is it, Chuck?
Nothing, honey, it's just business.
When did you get this?
Just picked it up at the desk.
It was there waiting for us.
Along with a few other items of interest.
I don't get it.
I thought this was all set.
- So did I.
- But, darling, what is it?
Please don't be so mysterious.
It's nothing important, honey.
It's just a little change in itinerary.
We'll probably be on the road a little longer, huh, Oscar?
Yeah, yeah. Well, I'd better leave you two love birds alone.
- You can go back to your... picnic.
- Yeah, thanks.
Oh, yeah, our picnic.
Where's that egg I had...
- Darling.
- Hm?
That was beautiful.
It made me cry.
Makes my father cry, too when he thinks of all the money he threw away on my lessons.
You play so beautifully.
I wonder why you always act as if you were ashamed of it.
Because I hate amateurs.
I'm an all or nothing guy.
I wanted to be Rachmaninoff and the job was filled.
Now you know the story of my life.
But you didn't come up here to talk about me.
What's on your mind?
- I'm worried, Oscar.
- What about?
About what was really in that telegram.
Alright, I'll tell you.
The Pennsylvania deal's off.
- Caput.
- Oh, no, Oscar.
Yeah, that's what I always say.
A bunch of sharp operators in Wall Street get themselves tangled up in ticker tape so, Chuck Arnold can't play the Pennsylvania Roof.
Figure out the square root of that one.
Well, the Pennsylvania is not the only hotel in New York.
It's not just the Pennsylvania.
It's all the hotels, and the nightspots and the dance floors.
People aren't going to stop dancing overnight just because there's been a crash in the stock market.
Oh, no?
Take a look at these.
Cancellations.
They've been coming in all week.
The tour's falling apart.
Does Chuck know about these, too?
I don't want to spring everything on him all at once.
What's happened, Oscar?
I heard Chuck say that...
You heard him say
I should send the broker more margin.
Well, I did.
That went down the drain with all the rest.
Chuck's more or less broke, Peggy.
That's the long and short of it.
I suppose I've done my share, letting him buy me so many things.
It's funny...
I thought all Chuck ever had to do for money was to say, 'Hey, Oscar'.
I know what you're thinking.
Young America.
Well, never mind. Young America isn't made out of match sticks.
You know what I'm really thinking?
What a break it is for Chuck he's hooked up with someone like you right now.
Chuck's a funny guy.
He talks a good game.
Confident, carefree, good-time Charlie on the outside, but inside he's a sensitive guy with a pride that's made out of eggshell china.
He's a real artist in his own way.
You mean at making music that sounds like a rubber plunger in a tub of sour milk?
I got a right to make jokes like that.
I've been with this outfit a long time.
You know what it means to take a bunch of tin ears and put them into a top flight musical organization that plays together, like they were getting their signals by Morse Code?
You know what kind of guts, talent, imagination, the sweat it takes to put yourself across the way Chuck has?
Never mind, Oscar.
We'll put Humpty Dumpty together again.
And it won't be with ticker tape either.
Only where do we begin?
Well, there's nothing to do now but call off the rest of the tour, go back to New York and wait for the wind to die down.
What are you thinking about.
I was just wondering.
Maybe it would be better for Chuck and me to go home for a while.
Wait there for the wind to die down.
I'd feel a lot safer somehow, than 20 floors up over Herald Square.
I was hoping you'd think that way.
New York was sort of a wedding present
Chuck was saving for me.
If things are as bad as you say... it's the last place we ought to be right now.
You're a pretty smart girl, Peggy.
But how are you gonna manage Chuck?
He's kind of a stubborn guy.
I'll handle Chuck alright.
Don't worry.
Worry? I stopped worrying about you two a long time ago.
You're gonna be okay.
Yes sir, you're gonna be okay.
- Why did you do that?
- Because you're sweet, and I love you.
This stock market crash is giving everyone the heebie jeebies.
It'll blow over. Things will settle down in a couple of weeks, then we'll get together and line up another tour.
A bigger and better one.
Maybe add a couple of pieces.
Yeah, like a few harps.
Well, I guess that's about all.
Oh, except that I'm wanking up what's left in the till even steven.
That'll give each of the boys about $250 apiece.
When you get it split up bring it up here because I want to give it to them personally.
You don't have to be such a big shot about the dough.
You're a married man now. You're entitled to be a little more conservative.
That's alright, Oscar. Chuck's handling it just the way I want him to.
You better get the railroad tickets.
Oh, Oscar, we gotta get rid of that bus.
Think you can find a secondhand dealer in this town to take it off our hands?
Darling, I've been thinking.
Why don't we go in the bus?
- Just you and I
- Sure, that's the solution. She's...
Honey, you're kidding.
- No, really. I think it would be fun.
We could take our time.
There'll be just the two of us... we could go on picnics along the way.
It'd be sort of like a honeymoon, darling.
Don't you think, Oscar?
Yeah, just like a honeymoon.
Well, you kids talk it over and let me know what you decide.
Oh, we've decided. We're going in the bus, aren't we, darling?
Well, don't just stand there.
You heard me... er... us.
- Where are we going, darling?
- Slight change in course.
With any kind of a stiff breeze we oughta raise Bloomington in a week.
Oh, darling, you're wonderful.
And it will save us a lot of money.
Now wait a minute,
Let's get this straight.
We're going to Bloomington so you can see your folks, not so we can save money.
Yes, darling.
- Chuck.
- Hm?
You know, I've been thinking.
You are sort of impractical about money.
Do you think it would be a good idea if I managed our finances on this trip?
I mean, I am pretty good at it.
I got an A in algebra.
- Of course, if you'd rather not...
- Darling, yes, I'd rather.
Leave in my Union Card, will ya?
- Well now, if you're going to...
- I was only kidding.
Boy, oh boy, the way a dame inches in up on a guy.
But these are my real treasure.
The 1861 1 cent blues.
Of course, they're not too rare in themselves, you understand, but... these are especially valuable specimens.
Very light, you see.
They sure don't weigh much, do they?
Oh, no, no, it's the color, the shade.
Many collectors specialize in shades.
Shades and perforations.
But, of course, if you look closely, you'll notice the slight depressions.
That's because it's intaglio, you see?
Hm, it's because it's intaglio.
Mother, look at them.
The paler the blue, especially in the peripheral area, the greater the value.
Now, for some reason, in Tasmanian greens, it's just the other way around.
You know, Chuck's going to turn out to be just like Dad.
Will you look at him, Mother, he's having the time of his life.
- What'll you have, Chuck?
- Lemon frost for me, Eddie.
Peggy, I've been looking for you all evening.
Are you gonna be here for the jamboree next month?
Well, I'm not sure, Louise.
You see, our manager...
No, I just got a line from him this morning.
As a matter of fact they want us to go in to the Flamingo Room in Miami, in January.
Gee, Peggy, are you going to spend the winter in Miami?
Well, naturally, if Chuck goes, I go.
Oh, sure, we'll probably go on to France, you know, play a couple of weeks in Paris, and then on to Vienna.
Have you ever been in Vienna?
Beautiful Vienna in the spring?
So beautiful with the sidewalk cafés, and the little oompah bands playing there.
You know there's only one thing they like in Vienna better than a Strauss waltz and that's a waltz by Strauss.
And the beautiful ladies go clicking up the street this way, and the beautiful horses come clopping down the street this way, and between the clicking and the clopping there's something.
Hey, Chuck, ain't she sweet?
- Oh, no, not that again.
- Come on, Chuck, like we did last Saturday.
With all that jumping around?
# Ain't she sweet? #
# See her coming down the street #
# Now I ask you very confidentially, ain't she sweet? #
# Ain't she nice? #
# Look her over once or twice #
# Now I ask you very confidentially, ain't she nice? #
# Just cast an eye in her direction #
# Oh me, oh my, ain't that perfection? #
# Perfection. #
# I repeat, don't you think that's kind of neat? #
# Now I ask you very confidentially, ain't she sweet? #
# Ain't she sweet? #
# Ain't she sweet? #
# Just cast an eye in her direction. #
# Oh me, oh my, ain't that perfection? #
# Perfection #
# I repeat, don't you think that's kind of neat? #
# Now I ask you very confidentially, ain't she sweet? #
# Just cast an eye in her direction #
# Oh me, oh my, ain't that perfection? #
# I repeat, don't you think that's kind of neat? #
# Now I ask you very confidentially, #
# ain't she sweet? #
Too sweet.
Give me some money, hon.
It's our last one.
Sure like to have one of those records, Chuck.
It's really not one of our best.
The guy we had playing at our clarinet was limping all over his obbligato.
Hey, Eddie, this'll take care of the sodas and I want each of the kids to have a copy of that record.
We gotta go.
We'll see you again some...
Will you autograph this for me, Chuck?
Sure, anytime, bring it around the house, honey.
Good night. Seeya kids.
Chuck, that was kind of crazy, wasn't it? Twenty dollars!
Why?
Figure it out.
I buy these kids $20 worth of records, they take them home, play them for their friends, their friends go out and buy $500 worth of records.
That's simple arithmetic.
Yes, but friends have any money?
You mean everybody in the country's gone broke?
Nobody's gonna buy any records anymore?
I don't know about everybody, but I do know about us.
Darling, that was our last $20.
All that talk about Florida and Paris in the spring.
It sounds so show off.
Even if it were true.
It is true.
Anyway, it could be true.
Trouble is, honey, you don't understand.
The band business could change just like that.
And we'd be on our merry way, riding high.
The main thing is you can't let down.
People get the notion that you've hit the skids, then you're really through.
You seem to think that our only problem is to keep up a front.
You seem to forget, darling, we got to live behind that front, buy clothes, pay bills.
Oh, honey, you worry too much. I spent some of the best years of my life in hock.
Chuck, will you talk sense for a minute, just one minute.
We've been home five weeks now.
We've got to take stock of ourselves.
Figure out how we're going to get along.
Darling, our money is gone.
With nothing coming in.
Who says nothing coming in?
Told you I'd be hearing from New York any day now, didn't I?
Come here.
Take a look at that.
- Where from?
- Royalties. Famous records company.
- Quarterly accounting.
- $278,00. We're rich!
Like I told you.
I've got resources.
Now will you quit doubting your husband and let me handle these things?
Oh, darling, I never doubted you.
It's just that one of us has to be a little practical.
Alright, I'll tell you what to do.
From now on, you be practical... and I'll be beautiful.
Alright?
Taking him his breakfast again,
I suppose.
Look, mother, Chuck is my husband.
And if he wants to sleep late, and I want to bring him his breakfast, it's nobody's concern but ours.
Well, you needn't bite my head off.
Dear, take a jar of this plum jelly.
Chuck likes that.
Oh, I'm sorry, Mother.
But honestly, I'm getting sick and tired of people in this town acting as if Chuck were...
Well, I don't know, some freak or something.
Just because he likes to sleep late.
Why shouldn't he?
He's always done it. His rhythm's different from ordinary people.
If it was my husband, he'd change his rhythm to just plain march time.
Honestly, dear, don't you think you'd both feel better if...
Chuck was occupied with something?
Well, I mean, while he's waiting?
Mother, you seem to forget.
Chuck is a very important person in his field.
I can't have him frightened or bullied into doing just anything.
Something's bound to turn up sooner or later, even if times are bad.
Meanwhile, thank goodness, they're still buying his records.
I'll have some money for you this afternoon.
My goodness.
We're terribly touchy today.
- Hey!
- Come on, darling. Get up.
- What time is it?
- Lunch time.
I brought your breakfast.
- Here, you lazy, shapeless, cake eater.
- I think you're cute, too.
- Come on, give me a kiss.
- Hm-hmm.
- Oh, come on.
-Mother says I spoil you.
And I think she's right.
- There's some mail for you.
- Oh, Variety, huh?
- A check from the record company, too.
- Good, open it.
I got a surprise for you.
- I have a surprise for you, too, darling.
- Yeah? how much?
You tell me yours first.
Look, Peggy.
Was that the cat's hat?
I bet that'll bring results.
The whole page, darling?
It must have cost a fortune.
No, only $150.
I don't have to pay for it till next month.
Let's see your surprise.
Some surprise.
I don't get it.
They had some of the biggest artists in the business.
How could a big concern like that go broke?
It doesn't make sense.
I know, darling.
Nothing seems to make sense these days.
There's nothing for you to be concerned about, Peggy.
This sort of thing happens to women all the time.
Married women.
I...
I was just thinking about Chuck.
- You see, he doesn't know yet.
- Well, tell him!
He's a big boy now.
Two is company, but three is a marriage.
I want you to lead your ordinary, normal life.
Eat well, and be happy, and come back to me in about a month.
Here, take a spoonful of this whenever you think of it.
You don't need it.
But it'll make you feel precious.
- Hello, Peggy.
- Hello, Mr. Brock.
Maltine and cod liver oil.
- Feeling a bit seedy, huh?
- No, I'm alright.
- It's just to make me feel precious.
- Oh. It won't be a minute.
Peggy!
I thought you were coming over last night, you and Chuck.
Oh, Chuck was so tired, Louise.
He's been working awfully hard.
He's been making some terrific new arrangements.
- Come on over and have a soda.
- No, I...
Oh, come on, my treat.
Oh, it isn't that.
I just got a million things to do.
Come on, Peggy. I haven't seen you in a dog's age.
- Here you are, Peggy. A dollar five.
- Thank you, Mr. Brock. Just charge it.
Hello, Peggy. Been away?
How's Miami, Peggy?
- You want a frappe, honey?
- Oh, I think just a lemon frost for me.
Coming right up.
I see by the papers Vincent Lopez is playing at the Flamingo Room.
Lucky break for him Chuck decided to settle down in Bloomington, huh?
Make me a Broadway, Eddie.
Lots of whipped cream and less conversation.
What happened to Paris and Vienna, Peggy?
You remember, piano with the horses clopping up the street, and the women clipping down the street and between the clipping and the clopping it's really something?
My friends!
My very good friends.
How long has it been since you were patting Chuck on the back calling him a great guy?
Oh, he was in the limelight then.
Well, now he's out of work.
Yes, he's out of work, I'm not ashamed of it.
Only it's funny.
Cause I still think he's a great guy.
He's so far above you, you can't even begin to understand him.
You with your chocolate malted milks.
Do you think you can tear him down with your vicious little jokes?
Why, you're laughable.
Peggy!
Mother, I heard Dad singing upstairs a minute ago.
That doesn't fool me. I know your father.
He's worried about something.
He hasn't looked at his stamp collection in days.
# If a body meet a body
Comin thro' the rye, #
# If a body kiss a body, need a body cry? #
Good morning, Cora.
Good morning, princess.
- Good morning, Dad.
- Ah, buckwheat cakes!
Andrew what on earth are you doing in that outfit?
Oh, just thought I'd get back into harness again for a change.
Well, don't look so discombobulated, you two.
One would think I was too old to do an honest day's work.
You've had to lay off some more men down at the yard, haven't you?
Just temporarily.
But that's got nothing to do with my needing a little exercise.
Look at me, I'm getting flabby.
Look at that.
Looking like a bay window.
A little physical work will do me the world of good. Even Dr. Smith said...
I know what Dr. Smith said.
He said you ought to be taking things a lot easier, that's what he said.
Work never hurt anybody, Cora.
It's letting down that kills people before their time.
I gotta run now.
I got an appointment.
Andrew, you haven't eaten a thing!
I'll make it up for it at lunch time.
How's Chuck this morning?
- We won't know for several hours.
- Yeah...
Bye, Cora.
- Goodbye, dear.
- Bye, princess.
- Bye, Dad.
# All the laddies smile at me when... #
Finish your coffee, Mom.
I'll get it.
Telegram for Mr. Arnold.
- I'm Mrs. Arnold. I'll take it.
Sign here, please.
Thank you.
- What is it, dear?
- Telegram, Mom, for Chuck.
Chuck! Darling!
I'm coming.
Oh, boy. These Middle Western hours.
It ain't human.
Hurry, darling.
It's a telegram.
It's from Oscar!
Oh, what does it say?
A spot for you. Pick up band.
Starting Oriental Theater, Chicago, Monday.
Five shows daily.
Seventy-five weekly.
Report to G. Mason Moore and we'll start rehearsals tomorrow morning.
Don't be surprised if you look up and see me playing the piano.
- My God, it's Oscar.
- Oh, darling.
Why, show us a base.
Seventy-five dollars a week.
Why, I did better than this when I was a kid, after school.
It's not so bad, Chuck.
Just to tide us over.
Are you crazy?
You know what would happen if it got around that I was playing a job like this for that kind of money?
This guy must have a screw loose sending me a telegram like this.
- What are you going to do?
- I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna send him a wire that'll curl his hair.
Seventy-five dollars a week, five shows a day.
Look up at him and see him...
Buckwheat cakes?
You know? On second thought
I think I'll do it after breakfast.
I couldn't do myself justice on an empty stomach.
I can't see why it would be so awful for you to take that job.
I just can't.
Honey, what would you think if you saw Jascha Heifetz playing fiddle on a ferry boat?
Oh, Chuck, stop.
That isn't even funny anymore.
You're not Heifetz.
And even if you were, you can't go along forever with your head in the clouds, keeping up a front, ignoring the facts of life.
Darling, there are bills to pay.
We've managed alright so far, haven't we?
Yes, but what if something should come up?
Like a big doctor bill, or something.
I suppose we ought to come up and then we'll stop worrying about it.
- I'll be hearing from Oscar any day now.
- You just heard from Oscar!
Darling, sometimes
I just don't understand you.
You've been waiting for months for something to turn up and now this job comes along and...
Honey, I've tried to explain to you a lot of times.
Look, I spent years building up a reputation.
I'm supposed to be a big-shot band leader.
I couldn't afford to take a job in a scrub band.
That's the beginning of the end.
There's no way to get off that toboggan except at the bottom.
You just don't realize.
Darling, we got off that toboggan quite a ways back.
The end was about six months ago.
Darling, I'm sorry.
But you're living in the past.
$75 a week with a scrub band is better than nothing at all.
Not for me it isn't.
I'd rather go out and dig ditches or take in some floors to scrub.
Oh, stop it, Chuck.
You're not gonna help matters any by being stubborn and unreasonable.
Alright, so I'm stubborn, so I'm unreasonable.
Maybe this whole depression was my idea.
Maybe I started the whole thing.
I went out and sold that 13 shares of Amalgamated wire, the panic was on.
- You're talking like an idiot.
- Honey, why pick on me?
Why not pick on Mr. Hoover, or Mrs. Hoover, or the Federal Reserve Bank?
Why not your old man for not selling more bricks?
Because at least he's working, he's doing something.
He's not just hanging around the house week after week waiting for a miracle to happen, sponging off the family...
Okay, Peggy.
I think you said enough.
Darling, please.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
- I just tried to make you realize.
- You have.
Oh, don't be childish!
Okay, Grandma.
I must be toddling along.
You're not going to solve anything by running away.
I'm not running away.
I'm walking to the nearest exit.
I'm going to New York, where I wanted to go in the first place.
If you want to come along, okay.
If you want to stay here, okay.
I'm through sponging off your family.
- Is that your ultimatum, Chuck?
- If you want to call it an ultimatum.
Said you could come with me, if you wanted to.
And I'm not gonna beg you.
You don't have to.
I'll give you my answer now.
You can go. Alone!
And you can sit around and have a good time razzing me with your family.
New York. One way.
- Coach or Pullman?
- Coach.
That's $28,75.
- How much time have I got?
- About an hour. 11:50.
You change in Chicago.
- Any place I can check this bag?
- Yes, sure, right over here.
Peggy.
Peggy.
Peggy.
Yes, Mother.
You said you'd set the table for me.
In a minute, Mother.
Think we'll use the blue set tonight.
It's that sort of day.
Peggy, darling.
Sometimes we have to learn the hard way.
Maybe it had to happen like this for you to realize...
Mother, stop! If you're going to say one word against Chuck...
I was only going to say that sometimes things like this have to happen for people to realize how much they need each other.
I'm sure you'll hear from Chuck.
You'll see.
Oh, I'm sorry, Mother...
I just seem to have gone to pieces.
Father will be home soon.
You don't want him to find you like this, do you?
He won't.
I'll be alright in a minute.
- Oh, Oscar,
- Don't be so cordial.
You'll have a hard time getting rid of me.
I'm sorry, Oscar.
I thought...
Oh, come on in, will you?
I am glad to see you.
You've got magnificent control.
You're like the Rock of Gibraltar, Oscar.
You'll never change, will you?
I feel like a blob of raspberry Jell-O.
Believe me, I'm quivering.
I don't like airplanes.
I get nervous when I have to walk down a stoop that doesn't got a banister.
So I sit in the sky all night, like a petrified albatross just to get to Chicago to meet Chuck, and all I find is a high-hat telegram.
Where is the guy?
He's gone, Oscar.
Gone?
You'll stay to dinner, won't you?
- Yeah, but uh...
- Come on then, help me set the table.
So that's the way it is, Oscar.
Chuck's gone to New York... and I'm staying here.
You mean you two are going to let a little matter of pride...
No matter! Chuck's pride is no little matter.
- Look, Peggy, maybe...
- Oscar, it's no use even talking about it.
Chuck's made his choice.
He's gone to New York... and as far as I'm concerned, he can stay there.
Well, I guess Chuck just wasn't cut out for marriage.
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
He gave a pretty good imitation of a happily married man for a while.
Yeah, imitation is right.
Chuck's like one of these showy fighters with a glass jaw, he looks fine in the early rounds.
But get him in a tough spot and he'll crumple like a dish rag.
This had to happen sooner or later.
I think you're being a little harsh with him, Oscar.
No, Peggy, believe me.
It's better you found the guy out now, while you're young.
You can still do something with your life.
Why don't you find some other guy who's solid and steady?
Maybe a little dull, but somebody you can depend on.
You know, thoughtful, considerate.
I don't think we should judge him, Oscar.
After all, Chuck had to work awfully hard to get where he is.
So what?
Lots of people work hard.
Trouble with Chuck is he thinks this whole Depression is his own personal tragedy.
Well, I think you should be ashamed of yourself.
You call yourself Chuck's friend.
It seems to me you could find something decent to say about him instead of running him down with his own wife.
So you really don't hate him, do you?
- Oh, Oscar, what am I going to do?
- Now you're talking sense.
Look, I think I know where I'll head for.
First thing tomorrow morning.
Who is it?
It's me, princess.
Oh, Dad.
Dad, this is Oscar Hoffman, an old friend of Chuck's.
How do you do, Mr. Hoffman?
Any friend of Chuck's...
- You'll pardon my appearance.
- Certainly.
- You're having dinner with us, of course.
- Yes, Dad. He's been asked.
We're just about ready, as soon as you get washed.
We'll need another place.
Well, Dad. Chuck isn't going to be here for dinner.
I'll explain later.
You'd better explain now, Peggy.
Chuck!
Oh, darling.
Yes, 1929 was a funny year.
And so was 1930.
Old values crumbled, old hopes and dreams went by the board.
But gradually things began to change.
There was life in the old horse, after all.
And the Mayhew Brick Works flourished once again... under the emphasis of the man whose former talents had once all been directed toward music.
Remember, a brick isn't just a brick.
It's the earth and sweat of America.
Every brick you sell helps build our country.
It also helps build our bank balance.
Now go out and sell bricks.
You can't go back without seeing young Chuck.
He's almost three now.
You won't recognize him.
The lucky number dance.
Remember, Peggy?
Gee, those were wonderful days.
These are the wonderful days, Louise.
I still have my lucky number.
Dance?
And I get to dance with my husband.
You're beautiful, you know.
Am I?
My folks will be pleased.
Can I have my hand back, please?
Aw, don't go yet.
How about a prize for me?
- A prize?
- Hm-hmm. Something to remember you by.
# You're like a plaintive melody. #
# That never lets me free. #
# For I'm content #
# the angels must have sent you
# and they meant you #
# just for me. #
How do you do?
It's my very pleasant duty to welcome you here... on behalf of Walt Disney,
Leopold Stokowski... and all the other artists and musicians whose combined talents... went into the creation of this new form of entertainment, Fantasia.
What you're going to see... are the designs and pictures and stories... that music inspired in the minds and imaginations... of a group of artists.
In other words, these are not going to be... the interpretations of trained musicians.
Which I think is all to the good.
So now we present... the Tocatta and Fugue in D-Minor by Johann Sebastian Bach... interpreted in pictures by Walt Disney and his associates... and in music by the Philadelphia Orchestra... and its conductor,
Leopold Stokowski.
You know, it's funny how wrong an artist can be about his own work.
Now, the one composition of
Tchaikovsky's that he really detested... was his Nutcracker Suite... which is probably the most popular thing he ever wrote.
Incidentally, you won't see any nutcracker on the screen.
There's nothing left of him but the title.
And now we're going to hear a piece of music that tells a very definite story.
It's a very old story.
One that goes back almost 2,000 years.
A legend about a sorcerer who had an apprentice.
He was a bright young lad very anxious to learn the business.
As a matter of fact, he was a little bit too bright... uh, because he started practising some of the boss's best magic tricks... before learning how to control them.
Mr. Stokowski.
Mr. Stokowski.
My congratulations, sir.
Congratulations to you, Mickey.
Gee, thanks.
Well, so long.
I'll be seein' ya.
Bye.
When Igor Stravinsky wrote his ballet,
The Rite of Spring... his purpose was, in his own words, to ''express primitive life. ''
So Walt Disney and his fellow artists have taken him at his word.
Instead of presenting the ballet in its original form... as a simple series of tribal dances, they have visualized it as a pageant-- as the story of the growth of life on Earth.
It's a coldly accurate reproduction of what science thinks went on... during the first few billion years of this planet's existence.
So now imagine yourselves out in space... billions and billions of years ago... looking down on this lonely, tormented little planet... spinning through an empty sea of nothingness.
Uh, before we get into the second half of the programme...
I'd like to introduce somebody to you-- somebody who's very important to Fantasia.
He's very shy and very retiring.
I just happened to run across him one day at the Disney studios.
But when I did, I realized... that here was not only an indispensable member of the organization... but a screen personality.
And so I'm very happy to have this opportunity to introduce to you... the soundtrack.
Come on. Don't be timid.
That a soundtrack.
Now, watching him, I discovered that every beautiful sound... also creates an equally beautiful picture.
Now, look. Will the soundtrack kindly produce a sound?
Go on, don't be nervous.
Go ahead. Any sound.
Well, that isn't quite what I had in mind.
Uh, suppose we see and hear the harp.
Uh, now one of the strings-- say, the violin.
And now-- now one of the woodwinds-- a flute.
Very pretty.
Now let's have a brass instrument-- the trumpet.
Oh, all right. Now, uh, how about a low instrument-- the bassoon?
Go on. Go on.
Drop the other shoe, will you?
Well, now to finish, suppose we see some of the percussion instruments... beginning with the bass drum.
Thanks a lot, all of ya.
The symphony that Beethoven called the ''Pastoral''... his sixth, is one of the few pieces of music he ever wrote... that tells something like a definite story.
He was a great nature lover, and in this symphony... he paints a musical picture of a day in the country.
Now, of course, the country that Beethoven described... was the countryside with which he was familiar.
But his music covers a much wider field than that... and so Walt Disney has given the ''Pastoral''symphony... a mythological setting.
Now we're going to do one of the most famous and popular ballets... ever written--
''The Dance of the Hours''... from Ponchielli's opera
La Gioconda.
It's a pageant of the hours of the day.
All this takes place in the great hall... with its garden beyond... of the palace of Duke Alvise, a Venetian nobleman.
The last number in our Fantasia programme... is a combination of two pieces of music so utterly different... in construction and mood that they set each other off perfectly.
The first is
''A Night on Bald Mountain''... by one of Russia's greatest composers,
Modeste Mussorgsky.
The second is Franz Schubert's immortal ''Ave Maria. ''
Musically and dramatically, we have here... a picture of the struggle between the profane and the sacred.
Happy Easter
- Happy Easter
- Happy Easter
Happy Easter
- Happy Easter
- Happy Easter
Me, oh, my, there's a lot to buy
There is shopping I must do
Happy Easter to you
Here's a hat that you must take home
Happy Easter
Happy Easter
Here's a lid for milady's dome
Happy Easter
Happy Easter
This was made for the hat parade
On the well-known avenue
This one's nice
And it's worth the price
Happy Easter to you
Here's a hat for a pretty face
Happy Easter
Happy Easter
Here is one that is trimmed with lace
Happy Easter
Happy Easter
Here's a touch of the quaint old Dutch
It's an old that's always new
This in white is exactly right
Happy Easter to you
I think that is a lovely hat
Maybe you think so too?
I do.
Wrap it up for the chap
With a very happy Easter to you
Never saw such a lovely day
Happy Easter
Everything seems to come your way
Happy Easter
My, oh, me, what a kick to be
On the well-known avenue
Me, oh, my, you're a lucky guy
Happy Easter to you
Happy Easter
Happy Easter
Happy Easter to you
A bunny for my honey
A dolly with a curl
An aeroplane, an electric train
And a teddy bear for my girl
A kitty for my pretty
A castle for my love
Gee!
What do I see?
Brother, if that's a drum
That's for me
I'm drum crazy
Yes, I'm drum crazy
Yes, I'm plum crazy for drums
I've got drumsticks full of hot licks
And a roll
Loaded with soul
Under control
First, soft violins
Then sweet saxophones
Then blue clarinets croon
When it's my turn
I turn into a loon
When the drum takes the melody
When the drum carries a tune
Come on. Alley-oop. Now we go.
- Happy Easter, Essie.
- Oh, Mr. Hewes.
Darling, where are you?
- Don, I've been trying to call you.
- Essie, will you help me, please?
Thank you. Well, I got all tied up with an Easter rabbit.
Hello, sweetheart.
Here.
Oh, I wish you hadn't.
Haven't they come for your trunks?
I told them to pick them up this morning.
- They weren't ready.
- We'll send them by pigeon.
Here, try on your hat.
We have time to walk in the parade before our train leaves.
I don't wanna take that train.
It's the last one that'll get us to Chicago in time for our opening.
Look at that.
This hat will wear the prettiest girl there.
Don, I have to talk to you.
Essie!
- Take Michelle.
- Come on, short hemline.
I've had an offer for a show.
Well, sure you have. I've had some myself.
Yes, I know.
Listen, baby, we're a team.
We're playing the big time.
See that?
Nadine & Hewes?
That's written in stardust.
They've offered me a wonderful contract.
They say they'll star me.
And you can dance with anyone.
Well, wait a minute.
I suppose I could.
I've danced with lots of girls.
It's always been just a business.
That was before I met you.
This isn't just dancing. It's...
It's different.
This is...
...us.
It only happens
When I dance with you
That trip to heaven
Till the dance is through
With no one else do the heavens
Seem quite so near
Why does it happen, dear
Only with you?
Two cheeks together
Can be so divine
But only when those cheeks
Are yours and mine
I've danced with dozens of others
The whole night through
But the thrill that comes with spring
When anything could happen
That only happens with you
But the thrill that comes with spring
When anything could happen
It only happens
I hope I'm intruding.
Why, Professor, when did you get in?
Just now. I had to make up an exam.
- I've got the whole holiday before me.
- Good.
- Need any help celebrating?
- Nadine.
- Johnny.
- I brought you something.
Oh, Johnny! Oh, Johnny, what a darling.
I know just the dress to wear him with.
Essie. Essie!
- Take your coat off.
- Look what Mr. Harrow brought us.
- Another one?
- For my new beige suit.
Who pushed you in the face?
I want to give you a farewell tonight.
Where will it be? Delmonico's?
- Please sit down.
- Sherry's?
You decide, you're the party boy.
Gosh, I wish you two weren't leaving.
I'm not leaving.
Oh, but, darling.
I signed that contract, Don.
- You what?
- I signed it this afternoon.
I'm going into a show, Johnny.
Why, you're kidding.
We've signed contracts for the next six months.
You did. I didn't.
There's no way they can hold me.
I know it must sound terribly selfish of me, Don...
...but I've got to think of myself.
After all, there's no future in my just being a ballroom dancer.
You do understand, don't you?
No. I'm sorry.
I don't understand.
- Don...
- Johnny, you understand.
Frankly, no.
You can't be serious.
It doesn't make sense.
- I always thought you and Don were...
- Did you?
He's done everything in the world for you.
Why walk out on him now?
Johnny...
...don't you know?
I think I'd better go and look for Don.
We have a dinner date.
- We'll be back.
- But...
- Can you drown a brunette in this?
- How tall is she?
Five-foot-six.
- Try that.
- Two bourbons, Mike.
She's not going to Chicago.
He travels fastest who travels alone,
I always say.
Right. I bet you know a lot about women.
I should. I've been single all my life.
- You're a smart fella...
- Mike.
Work behind a bar, you get to know what makes people tick.
This place is like a clinic.
People come in with their troubles.
Well, if you listen, you learn.
Been here 15 years, and I can boil down trouble into two classifications.
- Yeah? What are they?
- Women and their mothers.
- Hello, Don.
- Hi.
Oh, hello, Professor.
- What'll it be? Blond or brunette?
- The same.
Brunettes. They're the ones you got to watch.
How did you find me?
I didn't have my crystal ball, so I just followed you here.
Meet my friend Mike.
He's a disciple of Aristophanes.
- How do you do?
- Pleased to know you.
Don, I'm taking you back to Nadine.
Did she send you for me?
- No, but...
- That's the trouble with college.
You've been reading.
There's more sense in this than in a library.
- Right, Mike?
- Education's all right.
It's the people who spoil it.
Nadine didn't mean what she said.
You two belong together.
If she'd just fallen in love with some guy,
I could do something about it.
You know she can't get along without you, or you without her.
Who says I can't get along without her?
See those girls. Any one of them has as much talent as she.
You're crazy. There's no one like Nadine.
- Dances like an angel, knows how to dress...
- I taught her.
- I could take any of those girls...
- Show's on.
I could take any one of them and do the same.
She still wouldn't be like Nadine.
I promised I'd get right back. You coming?
She knows where I am.
She'll come around when contracts are out of season.
You sure?
No, thanks. You run along.
All right. Take care of him, Mike.
Okay.
Any one of them.
Do I need her?
Well, no man is an island.
- Thanks, Mike.
- Every man is a piece of the continent...
...a part of the main.
Sorry.
Yeah, I think you'll do.
- I'll do what?
- I'm looking for someone to dance with.
- Wrong number.
- I need a new dancing partner.
I'll give you $ 100 a week.
A hundred doll... That would never do.
- All right, $ 150.
- A hundred and fifty.
Thank you. Now may I go?
Sure. Just a minute. Here's my card.
I'll get a rehearsal hall at Michael's.
Know where it is?
Yeah.
All right, tomorrow morning, 10:00.
You'll wait for me.
- Hi, Hannah.
- Hi. Will you help me into this?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
There's a nice guy.
He's unhappy and a little lonely...
I'll bet he's lonely.
Got away from his keeper.
You know what he wanted me to do?
Give up a good, steady, $ 15-a-week job.
- Thanks.
- I didn't catch his name.
Don Hewes.
Don Hewes?!
I was born in Michigan
And I wish and wish again
That I was back
In the town where I was born
There's a farm in Michigan
And I'd like to fish again
In the river that flows
Beside the field of waving corn
A lonesome soul am I
Here's the reason why
I want to go back
I want to go back
I want to go back to the farm
Far away from harm
With a milk pail on my arm
I miss the rooster
The one that used to
Wake me up at 4 a.m.
I think your great big city's
Very pretty
Nevertheless, I want to be there
I want to see there
A certain someone full of charm
That's why I wish again
That I was in Michigan
Down on the farm
I wanna go back
I wanna go back
I wanna go back
To that old farm
Far away from harm
With a milk pail on my arm
I miss the rooster
The rooster that used to
Wake me up at 4 a.m.
I think your great big city's
Very pretty
Nevertheless, I want to be there
I want to see there
A certain someone full of charm
That's why I wish again
That I was in Michigan
Down on
The farm
She's not coming.
Come on, let's go.
You said 10:00.
She's only a minute late.
She won't be here.
At least I hope she won't.
To tell the truth,
I got emotional last night.
I can't remember what happened, but I seem to have been carried away.
Well, there goes five bucks.
Here. It's worth ten to get out of it this easily. I'll see you later.
Am I late? I'm sorry, Mr. Hewes.
I couldn't catch a bus.
It is Easter Sunday, you know.
I walked.
You should have seen Mr. Pastini's face when I quit my job last night.
He was furious.
Good morning.
Say that again.
- Good morning.
- I mean about quitting your job.
You... You told me to quit my job.
You said...
I know what I said. This is Marty.
- How do you...?
- Your name is?
Hannah Brown.
Oh, we can fix that. Sure, we can.
Now, there's nothing to this.
I lead for four counts, starting with your left.
Half-turn to the right, drop to a curtsy as I bow.
On five, rise slowly. Twist to the right, then to the left.
Right arm fully extended in preparation for the first lift.
I beg your pardon?
You understand, don't you?
No.
Miss Brown, what idiot ever told you you were a dancer?
You did.
If I did, you're a dancer.
Now, let's start this thing right from the beginning.
Now, left foot forward, please.
Left foot forward.
You're gonna hate me.
- I am?
- Yes.
You know your left foot from your right, don't you?
- I'm never sure.
- Oh, no.
This isn't my fault.
When I was little, I was left-handed.
But the doctor told my mother
I might grow up to be a dangerous criminal.
So they made me do things with my right hand, and now I'm not sure anymore.
How did you dance in the show?
When I danced in the show,
I had a garter on my left leg...
...but I haven't got a garter today.
That is your left leg.
That is your right leg. See?
Yes.
Here.
- Here's a rubber band. Put that on.
- Thank you.
Did I say I got carried away?
- Ready.
- All right. Over here.
Let's have some music.
This is what you do. And...
...left, right, left, right.
Turn right. Curtsy.
And twist right.
Twist left. Arm out.
Lift, two, three, four.
One, two, right, left, right.
Good. One, two, three, four.
Turn, two, three, four.
Turn, two, three. Change.
That's it. Now softer.
Very quiet.
Don't take your eyes from mine.
You just look as if you're in pain.
I am. The rubber band's too tight.
- Well, then take it off.
- It won't take me a minute.
- I didn't know. It stopped the circulation.
- Pick it up about here. Right there.
- I know it's gonna be better now.
- And, one, two, three, four.
Now, look at me intimately, caressingly.
Make every man in the audience wish that he were in my shoes.
That's the idea.
Closer. Closer.
More. More.
Lunch. Marty, about an hour
I think will do, don't you?
- Leave the music?
- I've got the place all afternoon.
- It won't make any difference.
- Okay.
Was I too terrible?
No, no.
You know, I've never really danced before.
You're going to be fine.
Mr. Hewes, you know, you don't have to go on with this.
- Now, look...
- I mean it.
You're a wonderful dancer.
You could get anybody to dance.
You could get the best.
I don't want the best. I want you.
I mean, look. You didn't ask me for the job.
I picked you.
You're gonna make good.
Not just for your sake, but for mine.
It means a great deal to me.
- It does?
- Come on.
Oh, look. The Easter Parade.
Isn't it beautiful?
It's all right, if you like Easter Parades.
I can't believe I'm really here.
I used to read about the Easter Parade in New York...
- Excuse me.
- In New York.
And then I'd look at the pictures of the women in their lovely clothes...
...dream that maybe someday l...
Here I am.
Oh, look.
May I take your picture, Miss Hale?
Hold it, Miss Hale.
Just one more, Miss Hale.
- Good. Thank you.
- Miss Hale.
Thank you.
Isn't she wonderful-looking!
Even with that silly hat.
- What's the matter with it?
- She must be very important.
Look at her clothes, the way she walks.
See her nose?
One year from now, you're gonna put it out of joint.
- I am?
- Next Easter, when we walk down here...
...you'll cause more excitement than an earthquake.
Every photographer will break his neck to take your picture.
One year from today, no one is gonna notice her when they look at you.
- This is lovely.
- That one.
Yes, Mr. Hewes.
May I see that, please?
- Isn't this beautiful?
- Wrap this up. Just send all the things.
Yes, Mr. Hewes.
- You ready?
- Yes, Mr. Hewes.
Mr. Hewes, I...
These dresses are beautiful, but...
- But what?
- Do they look like me, like Hannah Brown?
There is no more Hannah Brown.
From now on, you're Juanita.
If you wanted a Juanita, why did you pick me?
Now, don't get mad. This is business.
A girl dancer has to be exotic.
She has to be...
...a peach.
I suppose I'm a lemon.
No. Here's what I mean.
Now, when you walk down the street alone do men try to catch your eye?
Of course they do.
Do they turn around and look at you?
L... I don't know.
I never turn around to look at them.
Here, give me those.
You go ahead. I wanna try something.
Just walk on ahead. I wanna see.
Right! You've got it.
Thank you.
Let go of my hand.
Let go of my hand.
Left.
- I'm afraid...
- Don't worry.
- It was just the first performance.
- I was so nervous.
One thing you mustn't do:
Get a stranglehold on me.
It pulls me off balance.
- I know.
- Relax, you'll be all right.
I hope so. Did you send these?
- Yes.
- They're very beautiful.
- You go change, we'll have dinner.
- May I bring my roses?
Sure.
- Keep sending flowers. It's good business.
- Yes, sir.
How did the act go, Mr. Hewes?
One bow.
Too bad.
Eddie. Eddie.
Eddie, get down there. Sit. Sit.
All right, everybody sit down. Sit down.
Tomorrow we'd better get some dogs in the act.
- Here's the young lady.
- Nadine.
Darling, I was so excited when I got your message.
- When did you get in town?
- I got in this morning.
I can recommend fillet of sole meuniere.
- Monsieur had that last night.
- Last night?
- We'll order later.
- Very well. I'll remove this.
We're expecting someone else.
- Luncheon for three?
- Who's joining us?
Someone who's very important to both of us.
Johnny, I'm going to meet your father.
Look, Nadine, our future is so far away.
I have years of school ahead of me...
I thought you were almost finished with law school.
I am, I am. But I've decided to become a doctor.
I'll wait.
Well, it's liable to be a tough struggle.
I won't inherit any of my father's money until I'm at least...
...fifty-five.
- Fifty-five? That's an odd arrangement.
Well, Father was very eccentric.
He hated children.
Oh, I love children.
Maybe you could adopt one.
- There he is.
- Hello, Johnny.
Donald. If you'll forgive me,
I have an oral psychology exam.
You what? You'll flunk it.
Hello, Nadine.
I'm glad you're here, Don.
Sit down, won't you?
- Thanks.
- I've been wanting to talk to you.
You have?
You look tired.
Breaking in new routines.
You remember it.
It seems years ago.
I can tell you how many minutes it's been.
Is the gentleman coming back?
Yes, but not for lunch.
Luncheon for two?
We have some very fine broiled lamb chops today.
We'll order later. Thank you.
Very good, monsieur.
It's...
...very nice to see you.
I've been hearing about your new act.
It's not really broken in yet.
It seems so strange dancing with somebody else.
Remember our opening night in Boston?
Three encores, eight bows.
We stopped the show cold.
I still have those reviews.
- Listen, baby, I was thinking...
- I start rehearsal soon for my new show.
Are you going through with that crazy idea?
Crazy? Because I don't wanna spend the rest of my life being a common hoofer?
It was good enough when I took you out of that chorus.
You think if it hadn't been for you, I'd still be there?
That's possible. The fellow who ran that place wasn't Ziegfeld.
Let me tell you something.
If you can get along without me...
...tell that seamstress dancing with you to stop imitating me.
Imitating you? She's never even seen you.
No, but you have.
All my friends are laughing.
- That's it.
- You bet that's it.
- And you tell that Miss...
- Brown. Hannah Brown.
- I have something to do.
- Don't you dare leave me alone.
You forget, honey.
You're on your own now.
The gentleman is coming back?
You're wrong twice.
Luncheon for one?
May I suggest the sirloin tips to mademoiselle?
Thank you. I'm not hungry.
Certainly, mademoiselle.
Come in again soon.
Bring your friends.
How much is that, please?
Let's see. Roast beef, pie, milk.
That'll be 15 cents.
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Bye.
Goodbye.
You can't trust those weathermen.
They said rain today.
If they'd said sunshine,
I would've worn my raincoat.
Oh, I'm terribly...
...sorry.
That's all right. I think we can straighten up now.
Raining, huh?
Yes.
I wish it'd stop. I've got an appointment.
Nobody would expect you to be on time in this weather.
He will.
- Lf I were you, I'd divorce him.
- He's not my husband.
- Oh, then I wouldn't marry him.
- No, no, this is business.
- Well, I think it's letting up...
- Oh, no, no. It's still raining very hard.
You know, I bet you like to walk in the rain.
- Yes, I do, but...
- But home, in the country.
- Yes.
- In the woods, in the spring?
- But you wouldn't be wearing that hat.
- I really must go.
Oh, no, no. You can't go out in that.
- It's an epidemic.
- What?
- Pneumonia.
- What?
- I'll get you a cab.
- Don't get me one.
- I've only got two blocks to go. You can't...
- No.
Don't move.
In two minutes, you've managed to find out that I'm not married or engaged.
That I'm from the country, and meeting a man on business.
It wasn't bad, was it?
Yeah, but you haven't told me a thing about yourself.
I'm just a fella
A fella with an umbrella
Looking for a girl
Who saved her love for a rainy day
I'm just a fella
A fella with an umbrella
Glad to see the skies of blue
Have turned into skies of gray
Raindrops have brought us together
And that's what I long to see
Maybe the break in the weather
Will prove to be
A break for me
So I'll be the fella
The fella with an umbrella
If you'll be the girl
Who saved her love
For a rainy day
For every fella
Each fella with an umbrella
There's a girl
A girl who saved her love for a rainy day
For every fella
Each fella with an umbrella
There's a time when skies of blue
Must turn into skies of gray
Raindrops have brought us together
That's what they were meant to do
Maybe the break in the weather
Will turn into
A break for you
And I'll help the fella
The fella with an umbrella
Help him find the girl
Who saved her love
For a rainy day
One of the first rules of this business is to be punctual.
- You're a half-hour late.
- I'm sorry.
- All right.
- I got caught in the...
I said, all right.
I have something important to talk about.
I found out what's wrong with our act.
- You did?
- Yes.
You've been trying to be somebody else.
I've been trying to what?
- Look at you.
- What's the matter?
- That dress.
- I've tried to explain...
- That hat.
- I knew I wouldn't look good.
- The way you move in the numbers.
- You told me to move like that.
All right. I've changed my mind.
- From now on, you're gonna be yourself.
- I am?
You'll start from the beginning.
There'll be no more fancy dresses.
There is no more Juanita.
From now on, you're just plain
Hannah Brown.
Whatever you say.
- Do you know this song?
- Yes.
- I'd like to hear you sing it, please.
- All right.
Get over there where
I can see you, please.
I love the piano
I love the piano
I love to hear somebody play
Upon a piano
A grand piano
It simply carries me away
I know a fine way
To treat a Steinway
I love to run my fingers o'er the keys
The ivories
And with the pedal
I love to meddle
When Paderewski comes this way
I'm so delighted
If I'm invited
To hear the longhaired genius play
So you can keep your fiddle
And your bow
Give me a P-l-A-N-O
Oh, oh!
I love to stop right
Beside an upright
Or a high-toned baby grand
Oh, that's wonderful!
- Is it?
- Wonderful. Great.
- Do you know this?
- Yes, I know it.
Good girl!
Cross.
That's fine.
Now around.
Oh, yes!
I love to stop right
Beside an upright
Or a high-toned baby grand
All night long he calls her
"snookey ookums"
Snookey ookums
All they do is talk like babies
She's his "jelly-elly roll"
He's her "sugey-ugar bowl"
Here's the way they bill and coo
"Poogywoo," poogywoo
Poogywoo
All night long he calls her
"snookey ookums"
Snookey ookums
All night long the neighbors shout
"Cut it out," "Cut it out"
"Cut it out!"
They cry, "For goodness sake
Don't keep us all awake
With your snookey-ookey-ookey
Baby talk"
Fiddle up, fiddle up
On your violin
Lay right on it
Rest your chin upon it
Doggone, you better begin
And play an overture upon your violin
Hurry up, hurry up
With your violin
Make it sooner
Don't you stop to tune her
Fid, fid, fid, fiddle the middle
Of your ragtime violin
When the midnight choo-choo
Leaves for Alabam'
Alabam', Alabam'
- I'll be right there
- Where'll you be?
- I've got my fare
- Show it to me
When I see that rusty-haired
Conductor man
What'll you do?
I'll grab him by the collar
And I'll holler
"Alabam'! Alabam'!"
That's where you stop your train
That brings me back again
Down home where I'll remain
Where my honey lamb
Am
I will be right there with bells
When that old conductor yells
"All aboard, all aboard
All aboard for Alabam'!"
I will be right there with bells
When that old conductor yells
"All aboard
All aboard
All aboard for Alabam'!"
Stop it! Stop it!
They'll be asking Mr. Ziegfeld for more money. Good news, Don.
He liked the act and he wants to see you right away.
- Thanks, Al.
- That was charming.
Don, isn't that the girl we saw in the Easter Parade?
You know, the one with that hat?
- There's no need to introduce you two.
- Hello, Don.
- Hello, Nadine.
- How nice to have you in my show.
- Your show?
- This is Miss Brown.
- Nadine Hale, star of our show.
- How do you do?
I've been looking forward to meeting you.
Don and I have talked about you.
- Don and you...?
- Harry, we'll do Miss Hale's number.
Excuse me.
Harry, I think I'll need four extra bars on my intro in order to get...
Is that the Nadine you used to dance with?
Yeah.
Why didn't you tell me?
- Well, I never thought about it.
- Were you in love?
- What?
- Were you in love with her?
- Well, we...
- Never mind.
- Hannah, look...
- Don, Mr. Ziegfeld's waiting upstairs.
I'll meet you at the hotel.
Taxi.
Taxi.
Hello, there!
- Oh, hello.
- Where have you been?
I've been living in that drugstore waiting for you.
- How are you?
- Fine. How are you?
Fine.
- Gosh, it's good to see you again.
- It's good to see you too.
This brilliant conversation's costing you money.
Yes. I must go anyway.
- What are you doing here?
- We just auditioned for the show.
Have you ever heard of Hannah & Hewes?
Hannah & Hewes?
Don't tell me you're Hannah Brown.
- Don't tell me you've ever heard of me.
- Of course I have, from Don.
- Do you know Don?
- Do I know him? We're like brothers.
- Hey.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, I have to...
Wait a minute, now.
I'm not gonna lose you again.
- Have dinner with me tonight?
- I don't think...
It ain't worth it, lady.
- I'm almost one of the family.
- All right.
- I'll fix it with Don.
- Fine.
- Where are you staying?
- Regency Park Hotel.
- Regency Park Hotel.
- I'll pick you up at 7:30.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Officer, I thank you.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Well...
...what did he say? When do we start?
We don't. We turned it down.
Turned it down?
But, Don, l...
I don't understand.
This is everything we've worked for.
It's everything you've dreamed of.
Come here.
Sit down.
Now, look, there are all kinds of dreams.
Some people dream about a little farm to settle down on...
...a spot all their own.
That's what we want...
...only our spot's on a marquee.
"Hannah & Hewes" in blazing lights.
It's got to be all ours.
We're not sharing it.
Besides, Nadine doesn't belong in the same show with you! She can't compare to you!
She can't?
No.
Professor! How did you know
I was here?
- Well...
- This is wonderful. Come on in.
Hannah, this is the greatest guy.
Johnny Harrow, Hannah Brown.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Won't you sit down.
- Thank you.
- What are you doing tonight?
- Well, I had plans...
Cancel. Dine with us.
I'll make a reservation.
We won't take no for an answer, will we, Hannah?
- Wanna get yourself a date?
- Well, I have a date, I think.
- Fine. Bring her along.
- Thanks. I will.
- Those are lovely.
- Oh, they're for you.
Thank you, Johnny. It won't take me a minute. I'll get dressed.
Don, you're welcome to join us...
...if you'd like to.
There's no point in your wasting those flowers on me.
Look, tell Hannah I'll see her tomorrow.
- So long, Johnny.
- Goodbye, Don.
- Don said he'd see you tomorrow.
- Thank you.
Johnny, could we go someplace where we can talk?
Yes, I know just the place.
- Thank you.
- You don't want to order.
Yes, we do.
The specialty tonight is beef stroganoff.
- But you wouldn't like it.
- It sounds wonderful.
- Make it two.
- Two beef stroganoffs.
- Yes. What about a salad?
- Salad? There is only one salad.
Salad François.
- Your salad?
- Let's try it.
- Try it?
- What's in it?
I'll show you.
This salad has been handed down...
...from my great-grandfather to my grandfather...
...to my father, and from my father to me.
Spice...
...from India.
Herb from Africa.
Garlic...
...perfume for a gourmet.
I gently rub the inside of the bowl.
Petits pois from France.
Apartment 24B.
Egg...
...from a chicken.
Lemon.
You must be ruthless.
Cheese, Parmesan from Italy.
I put them in anyway.
Onion from Bermuda.
You slice the onion very thin.
This gives the salad flavor.
It makes it bright, refreshing...
...and gay.
Mix, mix, toss, toss.
Mix, mix, toss, toss.
Toss, toss, mix, mix.
Toss, toss, mix, mix.
Mix, toss, toss, mix.
Mix, mix, toss, toss.
I don't think so.
It's very nice here.
I like it.
Now, what did you wanna talk to me about?
You and Don are very good friends, aren't you?
Yes.
- Was he ever married?
- No.
Engaged?
I only ask because I'm curious.
He never talks about himself.
Just about dancing.
- Everything is strictly business.
- That's a good idea.
Sometimes...
...if we make a mistake in the show, he'll ask if I'll stay...
...and rehearse with him.
We go out and have a late supper...
...and we dance...
...just the two of us.
Sometimes I make mistakes on purpose.
You know, I think that François was right, there are three of us here.
Look...
...supposing Don were interested in someone else?
Do you mean Nadine?
Well, they used to work together.
- He was in love with her, wasn't he?
- I don't know. I guess so.
Well, he isn't anymore.
He turned down the Ziegfeld show.
Why?
Because he said that she didn't belong in the same show with me.
I agree with him.
Now, is there anything more that I can tell you about Don?
No.
Good. Now let's talk about us.
Did you know that scientists say that people fall in love quickest during a rainstorm?
I can prove that.
Because that's when I fell in love with you.
You're not angry?
Angry? No, I'm not angry.
I'm very proud.
Do you think that...
...you could love me?
Oh, Johnny, I'd be such a fool if I didn't.
But...
...l'm in love with Don.
Are you sure?
And it's...
It's nothing like I thought it was going to be.
It never is.
You know, l...
I used to dream that...
...when I'd fall in love with a man...
...he'd send me flowers...
...sweep me off my feet, take me in his arms.
It's nothing like that with Don.
He doesn't even know I'm alive, half the time.
When he sweeps me off my feet...
...it's during a dance number.
When he sends me flowers...
...it's because it's good for business.
Oh, he's taken me in his arms...
...but there've never been less than 700 people watching.
Oh, it's not his fault.
It's mine.
When they were passing out the wishes...
...I wished for him.
Our dinner should be ready soon.
I'm not very hungry.
Neither am I. Should we go?
Yeah.
We're not staying.
- You're not?
- No.
Your hat and coat, Mr. Harrow.
There's an old superstition
Way down South
Everybody believes
That trouble won't stay
If you shake it away
When they hold a revival
Way down South
Everybody with care
And trouble that day
Tries to shake it away
Shakin' the blues away
Unhappy news away
If you are blue, it's easy to
Shake off your cares and troubles
Tellin' the blues to go
They may refuse to go
But as a rule, they'll go if you'll
Shake 'em away
Do like the voodoos do
Listenin' to
A voodoo melody
They shake their bodies so
To and fro
With every shake
A lucky break
Provin' that there's a way
To chase your cares away
If you would lose your weary blues
Shake 'em away
Shake 'em away
Shakin' the blues away
Unhappy news away
If you are blue, it's easy to
Shake off your
Shake off your cares
And shake off your troubles
Show them that there's a way
To chase your cares away
If you would lose your weary blues
Shake 'em away
Shake 'em away
Away
Away
Hello?
Hannah. Now, don't tell me you're gonna break our date.
Johnny, have you heard from Don?
I haven't seen him since yesterday.
I've been calling everyplace.
No. I wouldn't worry.
Nothing could've happened.
You don't know how depressed he's been the past few weeks.
Then today, with the papers saying what a big hit the Follies is.
You know, he turned it down, and...
I don't know.
I'm so worried about him.
Oh, wait a minute, Johnny.
Will you hold the line?
There's somebody at the door.
- Hello, baby!
- Don!
- Where've you been? You read the reviews?
- Sure. Very good.
- But wait till you read ours, baby.
- Ours?!
- Dillingham wants us for a show.
- Dillingham?!
Yeah! He called me this morning.
I've been with him all day.
- He wants to build a show around us.
- Oh, Don!
- Where's a calendar? A calendar!
- A calendar? A calendar! Here! Here!
- Here's one.
- Yeah. Move over.
Now, everything's all set.
We start a week from Monday.
Four weeks' rehearsal.
Four on the road, Philadelphia, Boston.
Opening in New York April 6th.
Oh, Don, look!
April 7th. What about it?
Easter. We'll be here for the Easter Parade.
- That's right. We have a date, haven't we?
- Yes.
- Say, how about celebrating tonight?
- Wonderful.
- Go out and do the town.
- I'd love it!
I better meet with the writers.
Pick me up, huh?
- Right.
- Good.
Eight o'clock.
- Sharp.
- Sharp.
Bye.
Johnny, are you still there?
I'm sorry.
Yes, I'm still here.
Congratulations.
Did you hear? Isn't it wonderful?
Yes, it's great.
I hope you don't mind if I break our date for tonight.
Oh, Johnny.
That's all right.
We'll celebrate tomorrow night.
Thank you, Johnny.
Bye.
Operator. Plaza 3-1549.
Hello, Nadine?
Nadine, I'll be able to make it for dinner tonight after all.
Right.
- Hello.
- I hope I'm not late.
- You're right on time.
- Aren't we going out?
I thought if you didn't mind, we'd have dinner here.
- I'd love it.
- Good.
Champagne?
Yeah.
There won't be anybody to disturb us, just the two of us.
I thought we'd go over some new ideas I have for the show.
- There's one in particular I know...
- What?!
What's the matter? What have I done?
Nothing, that's what you've done.
Nothing.
I thought we had a date tonight, not a rehearsal.
I should know better than to expect you to be human.
- You're just a pair of dance shoes.
- What?
I'm tired of being a prop here!
- I don't even feel like a girl!
- Listen...
- You're just a pair of dancing shoes!
- You said that.
I don't care!
Besides, I bought a new dress!
- It's pretty.
- You haven't even looked.
- That's not true.
- Oh, isn't it?
All right, then tell me:
What color are my eyes?
You won't be able to answer that because you have never paid enough attention to it.
They're brown.
That's right.
- I'll get my hat and coat...
- Oh, no, please.
Can't we stay here?
- But you said...
- I know, but...
...that was before.
I don't mind now.
All right.
Fire is so pretty.
"It Only Happens When I Dance With You."
That's one of the old songs.
She's very beautiful.
Yes, but she doesn't mean anything to me anymore.
I told her I could teach any girl to dance as well as she.
And you have.
No. We have.
The idea was just this.
I started out to prove something, and now it isn't important anymore. That's all.
It only happens
When I dance with you
That trip to heaven
Till the dance is through
With no one else
Do the heavens seem quite so near
Why does it happen, dear
Only with you?
Two cheeks together
Can be so divine
But only when those cheeks
Are yours and mine
I've danced with dozens of others
The whole night through
But the thrill that comes with spring
When anything could happen
That only happens
With you
Why didn't you tell me
I was in love with you?
Come in.
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you? Thanks for the flowers.
- Nervous?
- No. Don't do that!
Don't put your hat on the bed.
It's bad luck.
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.
- Come in.
- Fifteen minutes, Miss Brown.
Oh, I feel like I'm going to my execution.
Don't worry. They love you.
That's unanimous.
Come in.
- Hello, Don.
- Hi, John.
I'll go start leading the applause.
Good luck.
- Thanks, John.
- Don, can you die from fright?
You'll be all right once you get on-stage.
I better go get dressed. Good luck.
- Thank you.
- Don't forget to watch my number...
...with all those beautiful girls.
This is my left leg. This is my right.
This is my... Anna? Anna, my garter.
- Garter?
- The garter for me. Where is it? The garter.
Here he comes
Looking for his baby
It's for sure
Sure and not for maybe
Don't ask when will the lucky day be
Here he comes
And let him tell you himself
If I seem to scintillate
It's because I've got a date
A date with a package of
The good things that come with love
You don't have to ask me
I won't waste your time
But if you should ask me
Why I feel sublime
I'm steppin' out with my baby
Can't go wrong, 'cause I'm in right
It's for sure, not for maybe
That I'm all dressed up tonight
Steppin' out with my honey
Can't be bad to feel so good
Never felt quite so sunny
And I keep on knockin' wood
There'll be smooth sailin'
'Cause I'm trimmin' my sails
With a bright shine on my shoes
And on my nails
Steppin' out with my baby
Can't go wrong, 'cause I'm in right
Ask me when will the day be
The big day may be tonight
Steppin' out with my baby
Can't go wrong, 'cause I'm in right
It's for sure, not for maybe
That I'm all dressed up tonight
Steppin' out with my honey
Can't be bad to feel so good
Never felt quite so sunny
And I keep on knockin' wood
There'll be smooth sailin'
'Cause I'm trimmin' my sails
With a bright shine on my shoes
And on my nails
Steppin' out with my baby
Can't go wrong, 'cause I'm in right
Ask me when will the day be
The big day may be tonight
This is Essie, Miss Hale. Mr. Hewes just did a number with a lot of girls.
I tell you, Miss Hale, any one of those girls
is better than she is.
How was Mr. Hewes?
He was all right, but not like
he used to be when he danced with you.
That's fine. Come on back now.
I can't find a thing.
I'd better stay for the next number.
I'll be right back after that.
We're a couple of swells
We stop at the best hotels
But we prefer the country
Far away from the city smells
We're a couple of sports
The pride of the tennis courts
In June, July and August
We look cute when we're dressed in shorts
The Vanderbilts have asked us
Up for tea
We don't know how to get there
No, sirree
No, sirree
We would drive up the avenue
But we haven't got the price
We would skate up the avenue
But there isn't any ice
We would ride on a bicycle
But we haven't got a bike
So we'll walk up the avenue
Yes, we'll walk up the avenue
And to walk up the avenue's
What we like
Wall Street bankers are we
With plenty of currency
We'd open up the safe
But we forgot where we put the key
We're the favorite lads
Of girls in the picture ads
We'd like to tell you
Who we kissed last night
But we can't be cads
The Vanderbilts are waiting
At the club
But how are we to get there?
That's the rub
That's the rub
We would sail up the avenue
But we haven't got a yacht
We would drive up the avenue
But the horse we had was shot
We would ride on a trolley car
But we haven't got the fare
So we'll walk up the avenue
Yes, we'll walk up the avenue
Yes, we'll walk up the avenue
Till we're there
We would swim up the avenue
But we haven't any lake
So we'll walk up the avenue
Yes, we'll walk up the avenue
Yes, a walk up the avenue's
What we'll take
- Mind if I say I told you so?
- Johnny, I'm so happy.
- Miss Brown, you were magnificent.
- Thank you.
- You were wonderful.
- Thank you.
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- All right.
- Hello, Johnny.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Great show, Johnny.
- Don.
- Yeah?
- Just wonderful, really.
- Thanks.
I'm taking Hannah to celebrate. Come.
I'm going to the roof to see Nadine.
- Oh, fine.
- Come in.
Come in.
- Don, you know where I'd like to go?
- Where?
To Pastini's, where we met.
Sure, but some other night.
I made reservations for the Ziegfeld Follies.
- We gotta celebrate.
- All right.
- Good night, Anna.
- Good night.
Good night.
And there she was, all dirtied up, and with a man's clothes on.
When they danced together, they laughed at her. It was just awful.
Come in.
- Good evening, Nadine.
- Oh, hello.
Well, Essie, I see you got here before me.
I suppose you won't believe me, Johnny, but I'm sorry for her. Really sorry.
What?
Essie was telling me about their show tonight.
Oh, you were?
- On-stage, Miss Hale.
- Oh, coming.
Essie, don't forget my slippers.
I'm flattered you came tonight, Johnny.
I wasn't sure you could tear yourself away.
Oh, dear, I wish they'd stop.
They won't until we take a bow. Come on.
- Who's getting the hand?
- Hannah & Hewes.
- What?!
- They made a big hit in that show tonight.
I still say she doesn't compare to you.
The girl I love
Is on a magazine cover
It seems they painted her
Just for me
I'd fall in love
If I could ever discover
A little girl quite as nice as she
If I could meet
A girl as sweet
I'd simply claim her
And name her my queen
For if she ever came
I would love her the same
As I love her
On the cover
Of a magazine
If I could meet
A girl as sweet
I'd simply claim her
And name her my queen
For if she ever came
I would love her the same
As I love her
On the cover
Of a magazine
On the cover
Of a magazine
Here, take this. I'm not through yet.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
My former partner, Mr. Don Hewes, is here this evening.
And perhaps we can persuade Mr. Hewes to do one of our old numbers:
"It Only Happens When I Dance With You."
Oh, no.
Please, Don.
- What time does the last show start?
- This isn't an all-night joint...
Hannah.
Hello, Mike.
Gosh, it's good to see you.
If I knew you were coming,
I'd have cleaned the place up.
Oh, no, it's never looked so wonderful.
- Gosh, you look pretty.
- Hello, Joe.
- Hello, Hannah.
- Been reading all about you.
How does it feel to be a big success?
Fine.
- How are things with you, Mike?
- Oh, always the same.
Problem with every drink.
People's troubles never change.
- Don't they?
- No. They always come in...
...whenever they've got...
How about some champagne?
No, thanks. I don't think so.
Well, I'm gonna celebrate your opening night.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
This is your opening night, isn't it?
Well, what are you doing here by yourself?
Oh, I don't know. I just...
...wanted to get away for a while.
Sure.
If there's anything I can do, break anyone's neck, just say the word.
No, thanks, Mike.
There isn't anything anyone can do.
Don't say that.
No man is that important.
Plenty of fish left in the sea.
- You know, it's always darkest...
- Oh, Mike, please.
I don't think you've got a motto for what my kind of trouble is.
Maybe not.
Maybe not.
But I've got a poem.
For ev'ry rose that withers and dies,
Another blooms in its stead
A new love waits to open its eyes
After the old love is dead
That sounds all right
In a careless rhyme
But there's seldom
A second time
Better luck next time
That could never be
Because there ain't gonna be
No next time
For me
No, sirree
Made up my mind
To make another start
I've made my mind up
But I can't make up my heart
I'd like a new lucky day
That would be nice
But this comes
Just once in a lifetime
Not twice
So don't say
"Better luck next time"
That can never be
Because there ain't gonna be
No next time
For me
Good evening, Miss Brown.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
- Any messages?
- No.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Hannah.
I was beginning to think you were never coming.
If I knew you'd be here, you'd be right.
- Oh, listen.
- You're lost.
This isn't the Ziegfeld roof.
Why did you run off without letting me explain?
You don't have to explain.
This is after working hours.
- I had to dance with Nadine.
- You made that very obvious.
You couldn't wait, could you?
Was it fun watching me make a fool of myself all those months of rehearsal?
I was willing to do anything to make good, but I thought it was for us.
- But it was.
- No. The whole thing was a buildup...
...to get Nadine back. Well, now you've got her. Excuse me.
You're wrong.
I don't want her. I want you.
Depends on what song is being played.
- Would you listen to me?
- I'm sick of listening to you.
I'm sick of you using my life for a checkerboard.
I've had enough. Now go on back to Nadine and her Russian wolfhounds.
Tell her the experiment worked.
You can dance with anybody.
Good night.
Hannah...
...even a murderer is innocent until he's proved guilty.
All right, I told you I did start this thing to get Nadine back.
I was sore when she walked out.
I wanted to show her I didn't need her.
Well, I found out I don't.
I didn't know that until I met you.
How was I to know that you'd be the most wonderful...
...girl in the whole world?
Hannah, will you please open the door just for a minute?
I'm gonna stay right here until you do, if it takes all night.
Baby?
Baby?
- Oh, hello.
- Well, it's nice to see you too.
Did you come alone?
Certainly.
Well, do you mind if I come in?
Oh, I'm sorry. Please do.
I thought maybe Don might...
We had a little misunderstanding.
I know. I stayed over at his place last night.
I haven't slept all night.
Didn't close my eyes.
- How's he?
- I don't know.
- He was still asleep when I left.
- Asleep?
You mean he wasn't upset?
Oh, a little. It's always a nuisance auditioning a new partner.
Auditioning?!
He can't do that to me!
- Why not?
- Because he loves me, that's why not!
He's under the impression that you weren't fond of him.
But I am. Terribly.
- I'm afraid it's a little late.
- Late? That can't be. What'll I do?
Well, if I loved someone,
I'd find a way to let them know it.
Well, it's different with a man.
- Why?
- I don't know. It just is, that's all.
It's easier. They can...
Johnny. Johnny.
Put on his favorite dress.
You'll be late for the Easter Parade.
Do something about your face.
You look horrible.
Oh, Johnny, thank you.
Thank you.
Hello, operator. Plaza 3-1598, please.
Hello, Nadine?
Nadine, get out all the hounds.
We're going for a walk.
Mr. Hewes' apartment?
Sam, where'd you put my...?
- What's that?
- These just arrived.
- Who are they for?
- For you.
For me? Well, they couldn't be.
Sam, well, don't put them down there.
- Go catch the fella...
- No card.
There must be some mistake.
Find out where they belong, will you, Sam?
- They're very pretty.
- For you.
- For me? Well, who brought them?
- A messenger.
Put them down, will you?
Sam, do you know anything about this?
You think we dare open it?
"Happy Easter, darling."
There must be some mistake.
He got the wrong apartment.
- Shall I open the other one?
- No, I'll open it.
What a cute little rabbit.
Hello, little fella. Hello, there.
Isn't he cute?
Aren't you hungry?
Where did you come from?
Bunny want a cracker?
I'll get it.
- Hello, Sam.
- Oh, hello, Miss Brown.
- Meet bunny.
- We're old friends. Happy Easter.
- Happy Easter.
- Thank you.
- Did you...?
- Aren't you ready yet?
- Just like a man. Will you get his jacket?
- I'll get it.
- You're gonna be late.
- Late?
For the Easter Parade.
We had a date, remember?
Here, let's look. Oh, very nice.
Never saw you look
Quite so pretty before
Never saw you dress
Quite so handsome, what's more
I could hardly wait to keep our date
This lovely Easter morning
And my heart beat fast
As I came through the door
For
In your Easter bonnet
With all the frills upon it
You'll be the grandest fella
In the Easter Parade
I'll be all in clover
And when they look us over
We'll be the proudest couple
In the Easter Parade
On the avenue
Fifth Avenue
The photographers will snap us
And you'll find that you're
In the rotogravure
Oh, I could write a sonnet
About your Easter bonnet
And of the guy I'm taking
To the Easter Parade
On the avenue
Fifth Avenue
The photographers will snap us
And you'll find that you're
In the rotogravure
Oh, I could write a sonnet
About your Easter bonnet
And of the girl I'm taking
To the Easter Parade
