The Canadian Northwest.
Here the first traders from the Old World intermarried with the lndians of the plains and forests to found a new race: the Metis of Canada.
Here, for two centuries these half-breed hunters and trappers multiplied and prospered a law unto themselves.
Then surveyors and homebuilders pushed westward bringing laws of land and property which threatened to end forever the free ways of the wild trails. ln 1885, resentful and confused, the half-breeds, under the leadership of Louis Riel, revolted against the advance of unwelcome law. ln that hour, a handful of hard riding men in scarlet coats, the Northwest Mounted Police, stood between Canada's destiny and the rebellion that was being kindled across the American border in a little Montana school house.
Three cheers for the red, white and blue.
Three cheers for the red, white and blue.
Three cheers for the red, white and blue.
Thy banners make tyranny tremble.
Three cheers for the red, white and blue.
Three cheers for the red, white and blue.
Three cheers for the red, white and blue.
Thy banners make tyranny tremble.
Three cheers for the red, white and blue.
Susie, you didn't sing the last words. l got scared, Mr. Riel.
He kind of looks like the big bad robber in the picture books. l'm going to let you all go home early today children.
- School dismissed!
- Bye, Mr. Riel!
Susie! Come here.
There's nothing to frighten you.
These are old friends from Canada.
Get the kid out!
Time is short.
-Run along. Don't imagine things.
-Alright. l'll sing good tomorrow.
You're not gonna be here tomorrow. l got your message, Duroc.
Returning to Canada is death.
For some maybe, not for us.
15 years of exile haven't changed you Corbeau.
Or you... l hope.
Canada change plenty. No more she belong to the half-breed.
The law come on the old trails, white people steal the land, the surveyor tell us where we got to live.
We send plenty letter to government.
She is too busy to listen.
Government take care of lndians, take care of white settler.
Ain't nobody take care of the half-breed people.
No half-breed gonna take care of himself.
She's gonna fight by Jove.
You gotta come back, and lead us.
-Against the Queen's soldiers?
-Yes.
-We tried that once.
-This time it will be different.
The lndians are in grand council.
More Black Feet and Cree than anybody ever saw before.
They'll join us if l say so, and fight. l got Cree blood, same as Big Bear.
-The lndian government...
-What? You and me, and Duroc, we will be the government.
With the lndians, we'll wipe the whites out of Western Canada.
We'll set up a new government.
Batoche gonna be our capital.
Half-breeds coming there by hundreds from the river and woods,...
-They still believe in me...
-Yeah.
You know what happens if we fail again?
We don't fail!
Corbeau's got something.
You've never seen a gun like that.
She squirt lead like a hurricane.
Trust Corbeau to know the newest way of killing.
-My gun shoots 1000 slugs a minute.
-lmpossible.
A Gatling gun stole near the border.
-Blood.
-Put on the dunce cap.
-l go fight alone. Come on!
-No! l will never let you lead my people.
You can be the saint that leads them Louis.
All l want is the whiskey business.
And l'll get it.
Or you'll get no help from the lndians. l don't want no help from a whiskey trader.
-You...!
-Corbeau!
Louis, if he don't get the Cree and Black Feet to fight those redcoats with us, we go smash.
And the half-breeds, they don't fight without Louis.
So maybe you don't like each other but you need each other very much.
Blood will run like water.
Blood? You won't notice it much.
The mounted police wear red coats.
Looks like bargain day in Batoche.
Trouble... Keep your eyes open and holster closed.
Left turn!
Present arms!
Present the arms!
Soldier, what for you don't do what l say? l go home.
Duroc, he's a go home.
Hey! Why you go home?
''Shoulder arm, hold arm, right, left, right about,...''
He change his mind too much. l go home.
Go home? Get back.
All you men obey the order.
-Come here!
-Red coats!
Johnny Pelang, dismiss the men.
Get the paper.
-Good boy.
-Shoulder the arms!
Redcoats coming, we dismiss now.
Go away, but don't leave.
You suppose the inspector's right and Riel is back?
The inspector's always right.
-The fort's 20 miles away.
-Dry up.
-Where did they get those revolvers?
-Santa Claus.
The police.
Cover up quick.
Hello, Freddie Monts.
Pretty heavy lunch box you got there.
She's just a little present for my wife.
Be careful she's not your widow.
-Brave man to give his wife bullets.
-Stow that.
There are men here all the way from the Parsnip. They mean business.
Fort Carlton tonight, same place.
Ronnie. l told you to forget that klootch.
She's poison.
-But Jim l...
-Never trust a blue eyed squaw.
There's the old wolf himself.
Go to hospital and call on your sister. Stay there until l come.
-Don't come on a stretcher.
-Sharp now.
-Hello, Jim.
-Hello, Dan. Quite a crowd.
Sure. Plenty friends of mine.
-ls Louis Riel here yet?
-He is the best friend we got.
Better advise him to go slow.
For 15 years we go slow.
Now we go quick.
We give you 24 hours.
On this paper we write what we want. lf your government say no, we make new government.
You're making a mistake.
-The law is in the Northwest now.
-So is this fellow.
You can't fight the whole
British empire?
50 mounted police, only 50. ln all Canada, only 500.
We got many thousand half-breed.
Big Bear and Crow foot got 10,000 warrior.
The lndians won't follow Riel.
Maybe they follow Jacques Corbeau. lf you bring back that killer you'll deserve what you get.
You're a great old wolf, Duroc. l'd hate to see you hang with that coyote.
-24 hour Jim, we want answer.
-You'll get it, if the wires to Ottawa stay up.
The wires, she'll stay up.
Just 24 hours.
Don't get them tangled around your neck.
-You think Corbeau no come, eh?
-He will if he smells blood.
Maybe he smell blood pretty quick.
Your blood!
Pull him down!
We're gonna fight! lf we want Corbeau, we'll be getting Corbeau.
The redcoat be skinned pretty easy. lf we want Riel, we'll get Riel!
-Didn't Jim ask you to stay here?
-Yes but...
Take your hand off that bridle!
Stand clear.
Let go of that bridle!
Shorty! lt's a boy!
A boy Shorty!
Don't you want to see your son?
A boy! Hang loose!
Out of the way!
My son he ask for see me.
Good for him!
Tod McDuff! l just have baby!
Remarkable.
-Hello, Tod.
-Hey, Jim.
Thanks for keeping Shorty covered, but l'm glad you didn't shoot. l was of a mind too but l was afraid l'd drop a stitch.
She not very big.
How you make sure that's boy?
Black Chief.
That's chief.
Look, Jim. l just got baby boy!
That's a fine papoose. l've got to tell my wife about this.
-Hello, April.
-Hi. l'll have to get Shorty's baby a rattle for that timing.
The baby arrived hours ago.
-Then you get the rattle.
-You rattle me enough as it is.
Hold still Niska.
Roll up my sleeve Ekawe. l will.
How can you deliver a baby, set a broken leg and look lovelier than a Christmas calendar all at once?
You're quite a picture yourself, you'd look good in a golf frame.
-Better in the same frame.
-Let's make it a family album.
Let's water the horses. We must get Duroc's message on the wire.
Right.
When you look at Ronnie even his hair stands to attention.
There's a contrary streak in the Logan breed.
-We just know our own minds.
-You don't know your own heart?
-l don't intent to listen to it.
-You will.
You're leg will be just as straight as sergeant Bret's back.
-Tell you what our plans are...
-Jim! l've been transferred to
Nova Scotia.
Nova Scotia?
What's that's where codfish grow, isn't it?
Orders are orders in my branch of the service too.
Niska! You mustn't eat that.
Your tummy will turn to stone.
Like your heart.
-l just don't understand.
-You'll never understand Jim.
Until something beats you to your knees.
Don't get yourself all over plastered.
-You love me.
-You see?
You don't ask.
You just make statements.
Well, do you love me? l might but l don't want to.
Help me, will you?
You're fine and right for yourself and for the service but
-anyway, l'm leaving.
-Running away?
-l'm no heroine.
-All Anglican nurses are heroines. l don't want to be bravely smiling goodbye to my husband every time he puts down a rebellion or goes on patrol to the North Pole. l just wouldn't let him.
When do you leave?
-Next month.
-We'll see.
Anything in the regulations about you always getting your woman?
No, but there should be. l gave the horses some water.
Have some yourself. l'll be there in a minute. l wish you'd think what it means to us if you leave. l'll have plenty of time to think in Nova Scotia.
Sure. What's time to a codfish?
But l'll track you.
To Nova Scotia, Afghanistan... or anywhere, because l still think we belong in the same frame.
Niska, do you think l'm a fool?
So do l.
You'll make somebody a good wife someday. ln the meantime we'll need you as a Mounted Police scout.
Duroc is my very good friend.
Nearly every night for 30 years we've played pinnacle together.
You can't be on both sides.
McDuff, you don't scout for the Redcoats?
-You don't turn against me.
-My father was a Highlander.
They helped knit the Empire together and l'll have no hand in unraveling it.
The inspector will swear you in at Fort Carlton in the morning Tod.
24 hours Jim.
You and me, like brothers Tod.
Aye, that we are.
But l cannot fight against the Queen.
Flesh of the snake.
Blood of the skunk!
You don't fight with us, maybe you don't fight with nobody. lt would twist my soul to fight against you Dan.
But l cannot fight against the Queen.
-Jerry.
-Yes?
Cover up for me after mess. l've gotta get out.
Next time tell that klootch to bring a friend.
Ottawa can't possibly act on these demands in 24 hours.
B0 atoche will boil over and scald half of Canada.
Rotten business. lf the lndians rise they'll be blood from here to Baffin Bay.
Come on!
Gates closing for the night!
Everybody out.
Civilians outside the stockade!
Get going, Uncle Blue Owl.
-Come on. Come on.
-Hurry it up there.
Hurry it up.
-Where can l find the head man?
-Headquarters over there.
Keep moving. Everyone out.
Hey you!
Who's that? Gabriel?
No civilians allowed in the stockade after retreat, mister.
-You'll have to come back tomorrow.
-Thanks.
Hold him for me, will you soldier?
He's part bull and don't like red.
A man from Texas, sir.
My name's Dusty Rivers sir,
Texas Rangers. l landed up here following a man we're after for murder.
Orderly, tell sergeant Bret l want him.
Yes, sir.
Ranger's commission.
Commissioner's deputy,
United States Marshal and here's my O. K. from your Regina office.
-l've heard of your organization.
-Thanks. We heard of yours too.
Thank you.
You come at rather a difficult time.
Sergeant Bret, this is Mr. Rivers of the Texas Rangers.
Howdy.
Texas did you say?
-Texas, is a United State.
-Yes, sir.
The Rangers are a organization rather like our own in some respects.
Yes, sir.
He's here on a police errand.
See that he's fed, billeted, and offered a bath.
Then help him fill out the proper forms.
Very good, sir.
That's mighty hospitable of you but l want to get started...
This way please.
They say Riel is gonna try it again.
Look out, l'm not Riel. l tried a lot of times l never got anywhere.
-Low bridge there Slim.
-Place wasn't built for a giraffe.
Gentlemen!
This is Mr. Rivers of the Texas constabulary.
-Rangers.
-Hello, constable!
Another criminal has leaked out of the US and he's after him.
You can sleep in that collapsible mantrap, sheriff.
Attention, to roll call.
-Constable Ackroyd.
-Here.
-Adams.
-Cameron.
-Douglass.
-Fyffe.
-Herrick.
-Judson.
-Kent.
-Kennedy.
-On patrol.
-Harder than rock but for your head.
-Lane.
-Logan.
Logan?
He was slightly overheated and went out to get some air.
Ronnie!
-Why you be so late?
-l was put on potato patrol. lf this potato is other woman... l eat your heart out. l was pealing one million potatoes just because l talked to you in Batoche.
Then maybe l don't eat your heart. l just keep him here, inside my heart.
Suits me molasses.
-Here. Want this for a padlock?
-Ronnie!
This lock both our hearts together.
Put it on for me please.
What's that?
Get! lf that wicked sentry finds you your cute little pelt will be nailed to the barn door.
Ronnie, maybe police no let me come Fort no more.
-Why?
-My father, he come back.
Who's your father?
He's very bad medicine. l remember long ago he cooked bear meat on stick give me piece in my hand.
Well l'll tell you what we'll do. l won't bite him if he doesn't bite me.
Please, you don't let my father bust us up!
Listen you little wild cat.
You're the only real thing for me.
Nobody, nothing could ever make me let you go. l love you so terrible bad l feel good. l'll be pealing potatoes the rest of my life for this.
-Douglass, a hand will you?
-Of course.
Mother and child, both doing nicely.
What do you ride in Texas?
Elephants?
They come in handy if you break a wheel on your wagon.
An uncle of mine visited Texas once.
Sir William Wade, perhaps you've met him.
We hung a fellow named Bill Wade.
That probably was not Sir William.
No!
Advise me what time Logan get in.
Good night Sheriff.
Revelly is at six o'clock.
-Re- what?
-Oh Revelly.
You fellows are pretty fancy!
Having ltalian food for breakfast.
Doesn't your organization rise by bugle call?
Sure! We blow Rev...
Oh! You mean Revelry. lt's been waking him up every morning and he can't pronounce it.
Any more than you can eat it.
We'll get your man for you. l was counting on being home by the 4th of July.
-Your birthday?
-No, my Uncle Sam's. lt's an American holiday.
Yeah. The States sort of set up housekeeping for themselves.
After being hatched and protected for 150 years.
-Don't mind him. He reads a lot.
-We stuck to our mother, that's all. lt's a wise child that knows its own mother.
A wiser one that appreciates her.
Good night Sheriff.
Good night.
But l still want to be home by the 4th of July.
Have your saddles ready for marching orders in the morning.
There may be action.
-Lights out. Good night.
-Good night.
Action tomorrow. You hear that?
Look, he's a Redcoat at heart. ls that the Rangers full dress?
Undress.
Very good!
Why do you carry two guns?
One don't shoot far enough.
-l'd like to visit Texas some day.
-You can.
Canadians get over to our country too once in a while. l'm after one of 'em now.
-Good night.
-Good night.
Good night.
That second red river cart looks like it had the mumps.
Wait. l'll talk to them.
-Good afternoon.
-How do you do?
What's in the carts?
-Take a look. lf you want.
-No, you have no warrant.
These aren't ordinary times, mister.
Rare wheels for a red river cart.
Open it up! Come along!
Pull the hide off.
Holy cat! Look at this!
Why did you do that?
We could have taken them prisoner.
There was no need to shed blood.
You're splattered with it too, Louis.
You can't back out now.
Get going!
Advance!
Get up there! Come on!
-Well?
-No word yet sir.
Fur!
Buy from me please.
-You buy these white ermines?
-No!
Buy from me please.
Furs. You buy these pretty white ermines?
What l got here is very fine, very young.
What you got is the oldest thing there is, only the original sale was for an apple not a fur. l no sell this for apple.
Stranger! l wouldn't buy any furs from that Beelzebub!
-She steals them!
-You tell lie!
Somagun Scotch lndian!
-l think l kill you.
-Heathen. l'll take you across my knee and tan your hide.
-l kill you!
-Oh you would!
Let go my hair! Let go! l'll get you for this!
-l'll skin you for this!
-You're gonna get it!
Let me go!
Take her hands off her or l'll beat your teeth out!
Logan!
Tod, report to the OC.
He'll swear you in.
Aye Him. Daughter of Beelzabub, l know how to handle a woman. l told you to keep away from this fort.
Pretty soon you'll no be boss no more.
Get out of here!
Wait a minute!
Where did you get that ring?
What you care?
Logan, l want to talk to you. l warned you about that klootch.
-My personal business is my own.
-She's a thieving little... l ought to wipe your jaw for that.
Don't be a fool.
-lt's because she's part lndian.
-No! Because she's all bad.
You'd lose your eyebrows if l married her, wouldn't you?
-Why?
-Why not?
-l don't see why all this...
-Do you know who she is?
-l know who she's going to be.
-She's Jacques Corbeau's daughter.
Look out! lt's April!
What happened?
Call the hospital orderlies.
Get the doctor!
Put that man out there.
Take this one first.
He's dead.
-Corporal take charge of the body.
-Dr. Roberts. This way sir!
-There's two of them in there.
-Gently, he's badly hurt.
-Who is it?
-l don't know!
Corporal!
Clear these people.
-Come on!
-Let Miss Logan through!
How'd it happen?
Constable Fenton.
-Where did you find him?
-On the Red Berry trail. l was on my way to a case.
How long were they lying there before you found them?
-lt happened just before l got there.
-Did you hear firing?
-Did you see any tracks?
-Some red river cart tracks. l couldn't tell how many horses.
-What Fenton able to say anything?
-He said something about a gun but...
Constable Fenton, what happened?
Wagon train, sir...
Carrying a...
Gatling gun.
-A Gatling gun?
-Somebody running guns to Duroc.
-Did you recognize the men?
-No, sir.
But funny foreign looking saddle.
Fenton, can you describe the saddle?
Did it have a big silver horn?
Biggest l ever saw.
What the boy saw was a Mexican charro saddle.
Probably ridden by the man l'm after, Jacques Corbeau.
Corbeau?
Have the bugle sound boots and saddles.
-Patrol of 20 men.
-Yes, sir.
Good job Miss Logan.
Better stay at the fort.
Batoche is not safe.
Thank you but l have several patients in my hospital. l wish l was one of them...
-Boots and saddles!
-Come on!
No member of the force shall discuss the situation with any civilian, except in being in the regular line of duty.
Alright. Bedrolls and kit bags on the wagons at once!
Don't let the grass grow under you.
Come on!
On the double.
Get 'em out there.
Pick 'em up. They won't bite.
Be sure you put that on the horse Logan.
-One keg of horseshoes.
-Right.
Don't forget the nails this time.
You can't sew them on.
-Right.
-And an extra wagon pole.
-That breaks you'll pull it yourself.
-Right.
One coil of rope.
You boys can sure slap a saddle on pronto.
Come on!
On the double!
Fresh team for you Miss. lnspector's orders.
-Thanks. l can hitch them.
-lf you say so ma'am.
Fall in!
-l'll hook 'em up for you Miss.
-Thank you.
Back up here you lucky horse. lt belongs to the Mounted Police.
-They're pretty good, aren't they?
-They're the best.
-My name's Dusty Rivers.
-lsn't that a contradiction? l expect you've never been to Texas, Miss...
-Miss...?
-April Logan.
-April? You're not fooling?
-No.
Here's your horse, sergeant.
Head 'em out.
Group mount!
Reform ranks!
Eyes right!
Eyes front!
At ease!
Make much of your horses!
April, l'd rather you didn't go back to the town.
Sergeant, what part of the parade do l ride in? l'm sorry, you're not going with us.
-April, with Riel on the warpath.
-l'm sorry too,
-but l am going with you.
-Corbeau is wanted for murder here.
He belongs to the Mounted Police now.
He belongs to whoever catches him first.
Hi, sis'!
Let your brother kiss you goodbye. ln the line Logan. l'll be glad to tend to any unfinished chores for you.
There are some things about you that l don't like.
-You're not exactly perfection.
-This isn't Texas...
Jim! l think l'm capable of deciding who l'll kiss goodbye. l'm not sure that you are.
-You ought to obey him.
-Do you?
-Not always.
-Your judgment's good enough for me.
-Patrol all present, sergeant.
-Very good.
-Patrol ready to march, sir.
-Pick up the trail at the scene. lt'll probably take you to Big Bear's camp.
-Yes sir. March them off.
-Very good sir.
March!
March!
Sections right!
Right!
Wire from Headquarters, sir.
Sergeant Bret!
Patrol halt!
-Dismiss you men, sergeant.
-Beg your pardon, sir?
-Dismiss your men.
-Very good, sir.
-Sergeant Field, take over!
-What the..
Dismiss the patrol.
Sections left about!
-What's up?
-We're staying here.
Not me, amigo. l'm gonna get Corbeau. lf you ride through that gate l'll place you under arrest.
-You can try.
-Sergeant! lnspector's complements: Will you,
Mr. Rivers and McDuff report at once.
Change of orders from Regina.
No patrols to leave until we're reinforced by Colonel lrvine. lt'll take a week. By then Corbeau will have Big Bear on the warpath.
And the Black feet.
-Couldn't you wire Regina?
-No!
The wires were cut two minutes after this came through.
Does the order prohibit sending out a single scout?
No. l'd like your permission to proceed to Big Bear's camp alone
-and try to keep him loyal.
-No! Only a loon would do it. lt's a ticklish job, but permission is granted. l'll leave at once, sir. l'll leave at the same time. l'd be grateful if you'd bind and gag this Texan.
-l'm not going where he is.
-Where do you want to go? l figured to pick up Corbeau in Batoche.
-Why do you think he's there?
-That's Riel's capital, isn't it?
You can't make an arrest in Canada. lf l got to have a nurse... give me the Scotchman.
McDuff, you'll accompany Mr. Rivers.
And gentlemen l hope you keep your scalps.
A nurse, at my time of life...
-Good hunting.
-Thanks.
-Sure you make that fast.
-Alright miss.
Climb aboard McDuff.
-Where are you going?
-Batoche.
-l wish it was 1000 miles.
-Seat's too hard for 20 miles.
Lady, to me it's just like sitting on a cloud.
Get!
-Are you riding with us Jim?
-No. The other way. l'll send you a postcard.
Canada is a lot different from what l expected.
The scenery?
-No, the people.
-Haven't had much time to tell.
Sometimes it strikes you at first sight... l mean...
You can usually figure a man by the way he handles his horse but women are different.
What did you expect
Canadian women to be like?
Like the scenery: good to look at but kind of frostbitten.
But you're not. l've always understood Americans were too busy building, and selling and shooting each other to waste time saying nice things to women.
-We get around to it now and then.
-Must be appreciated by your wife.
-Who's wife?
-Aren't you married? l've always held that a bachelor is a fellow who never makes the same mistake once.
You believe that? l did... until mighty recent.
Do you think a plant from up here would do alright in Texas? l don't know Texas.
Even the moonlight's warm and soft along the Pecos River.
Do you have fast horses in Texas Mr. Rivers?
The fastest in the world.
Betting they cannot keep up with the men?
Look!
-What happened, Mrs. Burns?
-Don't go into Batoche.
-They've looted the Trading Post.
-And driven us from our homes.
-How could Duroc permit it?
-He tried to keep order but... when Corbeau got there...
-Corbeau?
-Yes.
Excuse me, lady.
Enough!
Just one thing more.
Riel can tell you how this new government sets up.
But l'll tell you how it's going to win.
10,000 lndians turn loose on Saskatchewan.
They'll be nobody left to pull down this government when l'm finished.
Canadian woman who has so sweet the eyes, who has so sweet the eyes, who has so sweet the eyes, who has so sweet the eyes, who has so sweet the eyes,
Gentlemen,
Corbeau has promised you the backing of Big Bear.
When Big Bear leads the Cree nation upon the war path the Black Feet will rise with him.
Our fire of wrath will consume its oppressors.
From it will arise, not half-breed, but a free and independent Metis nation.
Don't mind me, mister.
Go right ahead.
Duroc, who is he?
He's officer from United States.
Want talk with Canada Government. l bring him here.
They found out quick.
Hey! l'm a Deputy US Marshal, Mr. Riel
-And...
-You know my name.
Sure! Who don't?
Here's my credentials.
We'd be happy to know if your new government means to work hand in hand with the United States.
The Metis of Canada will be happy to cooperate with the USA.
Suppose some fellow commits a crime in our country then trails up here to hide out.
We'll help you in every way just as we hope you will help us.
That's fine because l got a warrant here for the arrest of a man named Jacques Corbeau.
On a charge of murder.
Gentlemen!
Council is recessed.
Wait here.
That put a bee in Riel's bonnet.
-This bee on your bonnet.
-What's the matter with it?
-My first bullet shoots him off.
-Why you wanna ruin my bonnet?
Just so you know it is me who fires the second shot.
The one that go between your eye. l'll make you a small wager.
50 cents that l put a bullet through your vengeful heart before you shoot the knob from my bonnet. l take that bet and l take the money from your pocket because you'll be dead.
Corbeau.
-There's a US officer here.
-For what?
-You.
-Well?
He wants a warrant from my government for your arrest.
-Why don't you give it to him?
-But we need you for the lndians. ln two hours give him your warrant.
Tell him l'm in Big Bear's camp.
He can arrest me there.
He would never leave that camp alive.
You don't want him killed here, do you Louis?
At an lndian camp, who cares?
Once the Cree warriors were free men.
Canada belonged to you and to us.
Well it's gonna be ours again.
Take the warpath with us.
Fight!
Fight like you used to fight, and not one of these prairie cops will be buried with his scalp on.
Big Bear, that medal you wear is the Queen's.
The great white mother who sent food to you when you starved.
You're too wise to let a liar make bad blood between us.
Men say Queen no longer rule us.
Redcoat no more our friend.
This is our friend that bites with a thousand teeth of fire.
Make gun talk to them.
-lt'll tear it to rags.
-Squaw make new lodge.
A hole in the tent won't change the British Empire.
This man is going to hang. l don't want to see you beside him.
Make gun talk.
Two more strangers. l want his scalp. l know him.
Well you sure found
Corbeau alright.
You're as welcome as a broken leg.
Ahkakito, who these men?
Spies to count your men and horses.
His tongue is forked.
He said he came alone.
This man is no spy.
He comes from afar to take
Corbeau who killed in his nation.
Like Mounted Police want
Corbeau because he has killed here.
Are you afraid of Redcoats?
Their blood spills like other men's.
Look here Chief.
Before you turn that man over to the Mounted Police, l got an order for his arrest not only from the US, but from his own Chief, Riel.
And if you... l'm paid 72 cents a day to protect dummies like him.
Peace.
We got no war with the Redcoat.
Yet. But they no take away my friend.
You both come alone, you both go alone. l have spoken.
Big Bear was a great chief.
His friends will be sorry for him.
Now you die.
You can kill me and take this back but its medicine will be gone.
The great white mother gave you this to let you rule over thousands.
You are not chief unless she gives it back to you.
Big Bear will join his blood brother and fight for Riel.
Go.
Big Bear, you're a great Chief.
Why we heard of you way down in Texas.
But how do you know who's the best fighter?
The Mounted Police or Corbeau, the great killer of men?
-You better get out.
-Rivers.
Peace. Talk.
Why this fellow's killed in Texas, and killed in Canada.
He must be a great gunfighter, but have you ever seen him kill?
How do you know all these yarns are true? l'll show you if they're true.
He offers to show you.
Let him kill now.
Who he kill?
Me.
Another will die.
Slide my guns back in their cradles, untie my hands and l'll hold them out.
Then tell this tough man to go to it.
Cut the thongs.
Put back the guns.
-The man is daft.
-He's great!
Now tell him to kill.
Kill.
Go ahead Corbeau. Draw.
Tell him to draw Big Bear.
He's been bragging about how he's gonna kill? Start on me.
Kill.
Draw you yellow pole cat!
You're a good hand at shooting men in the back. What's wrong now?. l won't foul a great Chief's lodge with the blood of a dog.
He's yapping across the trail, to save his Redcoat friends.
But the medicine gun, she'll roll them all in the dirt. l have not seen this yet.
Then look.
What a thing!
That gun strong medicine.
Shooting painted horses is not killing men.
Before the sun has set three times l'll bring you the Redcoats of the Mounted Police, made redder with their own blood and full of holes like a net.
You're not a feather to be blown about by the talk of a coward.
Bring me in your hand their empty coat red with blood before three suns have set and my braves will take the warpath.
Before three suns have set
Corbeau will wear iron on his hands.
Come on!
Very nice entertainment indeed.
Now if you'll cut me loose l'll endeavor to show my appreciation.
You're alright, Sheriff.
Let's mush.
-l came here to get that fellow.
-l think we'd better move before Corbeau finds out the lndians took the bullets out of your pistols. l won't tell on you.
Come on.
Whatever you did at Big Bear's camp these men have undone.
What else could we do?
Our horses were stolen two nights ago.
You should have blown it up!
Leaving 10,000 rounds of ammunition at Duck Lake is inexcusable.
When my wife heard the half-breeds were coming through Duck Lake on their way to attack Prince Albert, she grabbed the kid and we left.
Thank you. That's all. l didn't think about saving anything but our scalps.
-We're going after that ammunition.
-Very good, sir.
But Col. lrvine's relief force is due shortly.
Relief or not, we cannot allow that ammo to fall into Riel's hand.
-l don't like the smell of this.
-What do you mean? l'm curious to learn where Corbeau plans to find the bullet ridden red coats he promised Big Bear.
That won't be his first lie.
Sergeant.
You will post sentries commanding Beardy's Basin.
That's the only place we could be ambushed this side of Duck Lake.
There's an old cabin there?
That's the cabin.
See that Basin below you? lf Riel's brigade cuts back from the Prince Albert road they'll come through the river bed there.
Each man two hours on watch, two hours rest.
Two hours on your feet, and two hours on your back.
At the first sign of the enemy fall back at gallop and report.
-All this time the half breed army...
-Moving in the other direction.
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.
You'll be relieved tomorrow.
Bye. Keep your eyes open.
Same to you.
Ekawe!
You fix leg.
Come sit in this nice green chair.
Does the cast hurt you?
No, you help her good that's why l help you.
-Help me? How?.
-You fix. Don't look at me.
Redcoat march for Duck Lake.
Half-breed, they wait in wood, kill Redcoat.
But l thought Riel had marched on Prince Albert.
That's just for trick.
They make trap for Redcoat at Duck Lake.
An ambush?
With the medicine gun?
Yes.
Your brother keep watch on cabin at Beardy's basin.
They gonna kill him tonight.
So he don't see them make what you call ambush.
Ronnie!
Ronnie?
You just trying to scare me. l don't like you pretty much.
But it's Ronnie who's in danger.
-You think l like him too much?
-lf you like him, you can help him.
What do you mean, like? l love Ronnie.
That's why you no like me.
You think l'm no good for him. lf you love him, you'll do as l ask.
He's on outpost duty at the old cabin near Beardy's Basin.
Go to him. Tell him to warn the Police not to march on Duck Lake.
-Why don't you go?
-They won't let me leave Batoche.
Nobody would stop you.
What you think?
Me save police?
Pretty soon my father have all the whiskey business and l wear silk and rings. l think Ronnie like that. lf you don't warn the Police,
Ronnie will hate you.
Maybe that man you love, that big sergeant gonna be killed.
Maybe bullet go through that Scotch lndian.
-Louvette.
-Somofagum, you think you better than me, you go save them. l'm not better than you. lf you want rings, l'll give them to you.
But don't lose anymore time. l beg you on my knees if that will make you go.
Soon medicine gun knock police on their knees.
Maybe tomorrow night the wolf come for what is left.
You say you love Ronnie while you brazenly sit there eating, knowing he's gonna be killed.
There's nothing in you but hate.
You're a savage Louvette.
A vicious, cruel savage.
Blood and revenge is all you know,
-not love.
-Hey you! l'll show you love.
What you want l tell Ronnie?
You'll go?
Sure l go.
Tell Ronnie the half breeds will ambush at Beardy's Basin.
Sure l tell him.
You go home now.
We'll never forget what you've done for us.
No. You won't forget.
-What's after you?
-A big bad rabbit.
Chased me all the way back.
-Male or female?
-l didn't ask.
My tobacco is in the saddle bag.
-Steal it sparingly.
-Thank you. l will.
You need wife for clean the house.
What in the...
What are you doing here?
-How'd you know l was here?
-My father is mad on me.
-Why?
-He find out l got big love for you.
Why didn't you tell me
Corbeau was your father?
Tonight he take plenty half breed made big ride to Prince Albert.
-But when he come back...
-Answer me...
What do you care who is my father?
You hate Jacques Corbeau more strong than you love Louvette. l'd be bat brained about you if your father was the devil himself.
You don't never marry with me now.
Once this is over l'll marry you quicker than you can say Somagum.
That's too late.
Why?
My father gonna kill me
'cause l love Redcoat.
We be married tonight or we don't be married never.
Tonight? lndians shoot priest at Frog Lake today.
Now at Batoche, Duroc he's scared for Father Piccard.
Gonna send him to Regina when daylight come.
Please, he marry us before he go.
-But l can't leave here.
-Nothing happen here.
Why you here for anyway?
Orders.
But you be back before somebody know.
Somofagum. l love you so terrible much.
But l'm on duty.
They'd hang me, shoot me, boil me in oil.
You don't love me because who my father is.
Try to understand. l have to watch the river bed.
That other fellow could watch.
Get in river bed with him. lf your neck wasn't so lovely l'd break it.
You break the heart.
-Always l know you lie to me.
-No!
But that lie is sweet and my heart, she sing like a bird. l don't live without you, Ronnie.
You crazy little loon.
What do you think you'll do?
-l'm going.
-No, you won't.
You're the sweetest poison that ever got in a man's blood. l love you. l want you.
We'll be in Batoche in one hour.
Maybe less.
Ten minutes with the priest.
An hour to get back here.
Ronnie! l'll leave word for Jerry he'll have to take15 minutes of my guard.
He'll yell, but he's a good egg.
Ronnie!
Ronnie, they're coming.
Wake up, Ronnie.
Get back to the fort!
The half-breeds ride.
Warn the force! Ambush...
-What happened to this town?
-They all go Prince Albert to fight for Louis Riel.
We wait in here for Father Piccard. lt's dark as a weasel's bedroom.
Louvette!
The rifle!
Quick, Louvette!
The gun!
You don't need gun now, Ronnie.
Tie him here.
You crawling black scum!
-Shut up.
-Don't you hit him.
-Get out. Get out.
-Pay now.
Get out.
Get out.
Well, come on.
-Cut me loose.
-l got to keep you here. lf l don't you be killed like the others.
You sneaking shewolf.
Killed? Like what others? ln Duck Lake woods 1,000 half breed make trap for Redcoat.
The whole force will be cut to pieces.
-Every man of them.
-Yeah.
But you're alive is all l care.
You, dirty squaw.
Why didn't you tell me? l'll kill you when l get loose.
When you be safe you kill me all you want.
Back to the column. Warn them the outpost's been killed.
Danger of enemy on all sides.
Gallop.
You'd better get back with the column.
Thanks.
That blue eyed klootch has got him.
-That's destroying evidence.
-Which might put that boy in front of a firing squad. lf the whole column rides into a death trap he'll deserve whatever he gets. l was thinking of his sister.
Do you think it'll help to make her pay for his mistakes?
Somebody's paying for it right now.
Sound commence firing.
Take what cover you can find!
-Turn the wagons over for barricades!
-Yes, sir!
Bring those wagons forward!
Steady men!
-Load!
-That gun!
She speak death like the rattling snake.
Yes. She'll get me them red coats for Big Bear.
Now that side!
Sergeant Bret and that Texan are coming through.
-Give them fire cover!
-Yes, sir.
Clear there...
-Help the Sergeant.
-He's alright.
You got nine lives, Sergeant.
Have a spill bud?
No, thanks, just had one.
Keep your heads covered men.
Still got one good arm Bill, use it.
Take your time!
Don't waste a shot!
-Look at that hat. 20 bucks.
-Wear a feather.
Get us out of this crossfire.
Fall back on Carlton.
Yes, sir.
Palmer, Rankin, root out that snipers nest to the rear.
-Right that wagon for the wounded.
-Right.
First section, open the Carlton road.
Sections on the right, fall back 50 yards.
Left sections hold fast.
Bugler, sound retire and continue firing.
Pick up all rifles.
Don't leave any ammunition.
Give me 10 men and l'll hold the road while you drop back.
You drop back with the men. l'll hold the road. l can't hear you.
Louvette.
Let me go to them. l'll do anything. l'll give you anything.
No, Ronnie. l don't let you be killed.
Doctor!
-We're back at Fort Carlton.
-How many got back?
-We don't know yet, sir.
-Many?
No, sir.
They were in the woods thicker than boiled beans on Tuesday.
But we couldn't see them.
Jerry was on outpost.
Why didn't he warn us?
Jerry's dead.
They must have got
Logan when they got Jerry.
Nobody got Logan.
He went over the hill.
-l heard the Sergeant.
-Look out!
Ronnie didn't seem to be that kind of a chap. lf Ronnie had the slugs in his legs l've got in mine he couldn't have run so fast.
Shut up, you fools!
That's his sister.
You always show up where you can help.
They let me leave Batoche is morning.
-What are they saying about Ronnie?
-They're all out of their heads.
Do any of you know where Ronnie is?
-They don't know, April.
-Keep that stretcher working, Sheriff.
-Doctor, the inspector's real bad.
-Alright.
Get this man ready. l'll be back.
-Some brandy here.
-Sergeant, bring that brandy.
-He's lost a lot of blood, no?
-Yes.
-Jim...
-l'm glad you're safe
-but l wish you were anywhere else.
-l tried to get here in time. l could have saved all this... l'd give that tourniquet another twist.
Where's Ronnie?
-ls he... is he...?
-No. l'm sorry. l have to go to the lnspector now.
But...
Don't fight. You'll be alright. l told you to take care of the men.
-Yes, but...
-Nevermind me. Get to the others.
Yes, sir. ls there an assault?
-Not yet, sir.
-Man the bastions. l have, sir.
Did you get proof that Logan deserted?
Yes, sir.
When this is over, make it your job to get him.
Bring him to justice.
Justice... l'm about to get mind.
-Take command, Sergeant.
-Very good, sir.
Some fool at Headquarters, wants to change the uniform to green.
Stand up for the Redcoats. lt's a good color.
-Any sign of a rush?
-Just steady sniping.
-Tod...
-Keep your head down lad
-if you don't want to lose it.
-Can you reach the river?
There's a very good chance.
Get the bateau and canoe and moor them 100 yards below.
We'll try to get through tonight.
That l will.
-Take his place.
-Right.
Look! Look What l see!
-Don't shoot.
-He is police scout.
He the Scotch man.
He's mine!
Nobody shoot.
Where is the knob from the bonnet?
Darn!
Blood of the devil!
Bonjour, you snake in the bush?
Duroc, you old porcupine.
-Foosh to you.
-You son of a pumpkin?
That's a pawky trick.
You snooling clootie!
Who is snooling clootie?
You bairn of a buzzard.
My yarn, my bonnie yarn! l'll never dare to show...
Aye.
You... You skunk you.
Such a thing!
Darn these pants!
Hold 'em up with your teeth.
You, dirty Scotsman!
Bonnie thing you look going naked through the fen.
For goodness sakes!
Yon goes the seat of the government?
Blood of a skunk. l'll show you.
Pig!
Sharpshooter down there seems to have McDuff cornered.
-Got a sight on him?
-No. He's behind...
Now l can.
Dan! Dan!
Dan... l didn't shoot you.
You win the 50 cents.
No Dan. lt was from the fort.
You showed yourself.
You're an old fool my friend.
One more game of pinnacle l skin from you the belt.
Aye, that you would Dan.
-That you would.
-No, Tod. l lose.
No, Dan, it is my loss, every man's loss this day.
The Big Trapper got me by the neck.
The 50 cents she's in my pocket.
Soup?
-Any more soup and they'll bust?
-l must get this...
-Stop carrying it long enough...
-But...
You've been ramming around here for 10 hours, using up all the Queen's bandages and l never saw you beat.
Well, you haven't been playing croquet.
Special orders is you stop now.
And have a cup of coffee.
Dusty, what happened?
Happened?
Did something happen? l didn't notice anything happening. l don't like women who cry.
You know something, lady? l make the best coffee in Texas.
You can float a horseshoe in my coffee.
Over and over l hear them say his name but they won't tell me anything.
Look... just kind of
-get down some of this Java
-Even Jim won't tell me anything.
Two sugars?
Jim is a great soldier.
But if you don't drink this here coffee...
Where is Ronnie?
What's happened to him?
Now listen... l don't know Ronnie so very well but l know you.
The first time l saw you l knew you better than anyone l've known. l know it couldn't be in your brother's blood to be cowardly.
But, love does funny things to people.
You've been a good soldier. l've got a tough job for you, if you'll take it.
You want me to put some salt on Corbeau's tail? l'm trying to get the wounded to the river under smoke cover.
-What smoke?
-We'll burn the fort.
-Coffee?
-Thanks. lt'll be your job to get April and the wounded down the river to meet Colonel lrvine's reinforcements.
-You'll stay and roast chestnuts?
-l have 7 men sound enough to ride. l'll be there when Corbeau throws those red coats in front of Big Bear.
Looks to me like you're just delivering seven more red coats.
Maybe.
Jim.
You've got to tell me. l know it.
But let me tell you first that l love you.
Always l guess. You'll never be able to look at me again.
Nothing under heaven can ever bring us together...
What do you mean?
You've got to know it, so l'd rather you knew it from me.
Ronnie is not dead.
He deserted.
He left his post, left his companion sentry.
He was killed.
He could have warned the column.
All those men lying dead might still be living if Ronnie...
-but he ran away.
-No, no!
He ran away with that half breed
Corbeau's daughter!
But l sent her to him, to warn him, to warn you.
Didn't you know he'd sell his soul for that girl? l don't believe Ronnie deserted. lf you prove it to me 100 times, l still won't believe it.
Jim lad, the half-breeds being a wee bit confused with the death of poor Dan Duroc. lt's the time to be going.
Tell Corporal Underhill to have the patrol in full dress order sidearms and rifles then set fire to the buildings.
Aye, all is ready then now. l hope you never believe
Ronnie is guilty but that doesn't change my job.
When this over l'm going to get him and bring him back. l will get him if l have to follow him over the icecap.
You know what that means for him. l know you're duty comes before everything else. l know it means more than mercy or love.
Go on, follow your orders.
Kill that boy who was foolish enough to put love first!
But don't tell me how sorry you are!
Just do your duty and kill!
We'll take you and the wounded as far as the river.
Dusty will take care of you there.
We're going on to Big Bear's camp.
Pray that l don't come back.
You'll have to let me look after you now.
-Better throw some wash in my face.
-What? l have no right to be crying over my troubles.
The wounded must be moved. They'll need all the help we can give.
Looks like you need some help yourself lady.
Attent hut!
This is a volunteer patrol.
Once we've entered Big Bear's camp no man of you can properly expect to come out alive. lf any of you prefer to go with the wounded you may fall out.
Thank you.
Fyffe, you're hurt.
You'll have to go with the wounded.
No, l'm alright. l can fight.
Join the wounded as directed.
Yes, sir.
We'll take the wounded to the river first.
Keep them under cover.
Corporal, mount the patrol.
Patrol! Prepare to mount.
They die in there you think.
Maybe so. l don't see nobody come out.
Men with leg wounds man the paddles.
Dusty and McDuff, scout the shores with a canoe. lt's a dangerous place you choose lassie. l can't leave these two men.
They're the worst hurt.
Good luck, Soldier.
Thanks.
That'll be Colonel lrvine's relief column. ln camp, beyond the bend.
That's a pretty sounding noise. l was afraid these boys would never see that camp.
You're going to and you'll get some rest. l'm leaving.
-Why?
-Going hunting. lt's no use.
Jim has Corbeau by now.
-Or Corbeau has...
-l wasn't thinking about Corbeau.
Ronnie?
Well, l'd like to have a powow with the wolfgirl he's been with.
Ronnie's dead. l know he is.
He wouldn't run away.
He'd come back and face it.
Sure he would.
Maybe he can't come back.
Maybe he sort of lost his head. l got a feeling l can make things easier for you if you'd let me.
You're grand person, but there's nothing anyone can do for me.
Sure there is.
Come to Texas with me. lf Ronnie's alive, he'll find us there. l'll never see Ronnie again.
He's gone.
Not when somebody cares as much about you as l do. lf you want what's left of me after all this l'll go with you. l'm a coward Dusty! l want to run away.
You're the loveliest and gentlest woman l've ever known but you haven't closed your eyes in 24 hours. l don't want you to say yes without thinking. l don't want to think.
When we get to Texas, you won't have to.
-Texas must be heaven.
-lt will be when you get there.
Pull into shore Tod, then take
April down to lrvine's camp. l'm splitting off here.
What manner of frisky are you up to now?.
Well, there's a couple of things l got to do. l kept my promise Big Bear.
Red coats full of holes like a net.
This one belonged to that Sergeant who said he'd put me in irons.
Medicine gun speak like thunder.
Keep your promise, Big Bear.
War!
Kill. War!
War!
So dead men ride?
You cannot kill the dead.
Tell your war chief to spread his blanket on the ground Big Bear?
Tell your men to fire!
Kill the dogs!
You tell me they are dead.
Let us know what dead men want.
Nestestu! Put the blanket here.
The blanket!
Put the blanket here.
The spirits of the brave are still inside their red coats.
They are sacred. Tell your men to lay them on the blanket.
The brothers of the dead are brave.
Put them on the blanket.
No, no! These enemies are in your hands. Pull them down!
Kill them! Now! lf one shot is fired, the soldiers of the Queen will come like the sands of the great salt sea.
You and your sons will die and your children's children will never walk on the Earth.
The other coats Big Bear.
We are waiting.
Put the coats on the blanket.
Pull 'em off the horses!
Kill them!
Are you afraid of 7 men?
Kill them, you fools!
There's no magic in their red coats.
Throw them to the crows.
Like this.
You're under arrest!
Shoot, you fools! Shoot!
Shut up!
Two men on the left, dismount.
Take the prisoner.
-On your feet, now.
-What's the matter? Tired?
You're too heavy to carry.
Will Big Bear kneel to the Queen and be the chief of his people again?
The Cree are brothers to the brave.
This fellow keep Redcoats out of Batoche.
Look!
The canoes go down river by himself! lt's my bateau, come on!
Look! Come on!
-Let's go!
-Don't let him go.
You know Louvette?
No Gatling gun, no Riel, no lndians, no fight.
You come home, l give you all the fight you want.
Yes, mama.
-You know Louvette Corbeau?
-l know no one like that.
Well, l guess that's right.
-You want something?
-You know Louvette?
-Yes.
-Of course.
-Louvette Corbeau?
-Sure. Come on.
Are you hungry?
No.
You don't feel good, huh? l feel alright.
A man's brain can be sick.
He goes on breathing and living until he rots.
My heart wants you so much.
She all the time say your name.
Ronnie, Ronnie... l should have torn your tongue out the first time l heard you say that.
No, we go away Ronnie.
Way up to far North.
To land of little sticks.
Nobody don't find us there.
One man l can't get away from even there.
A filthy rat that can't stand the sight of his own face.
Me.
My love, l make you forget.
Forget? l ought to...!
You want to kill me? l'm too much of a coward even to do that.
Because l love you.
Two wild geese go north.
Hello, Ronnie.
Why you come here? l was just passing by. lt looks like this war is kind of bogged down.
You come here for hurt him?
Nothing l say could hurt him any. lt's already been said.
-What's been said?
-Don't listen to him, Ronnie. l want to know!
Well, that you ran from your post and you're hiding out like a skunk and haven't got what it takes to go back and swallow your medicine.
-Does April say that?
-No.
She figures you're dead.
She knows if you could even crawl you'd get back there to face 'em.
Don't listen to him! lf you go back they kill you.
She may be right.
The militia's brought in martial law.
You know the Mounted Police are a great body of men.
For years they've been through hell without a yellow mark against them. l'd hate to see April's brother be the first to chalk one up.
Make him go away.
He just talk crazy lie for you.
-l'm heading for Batoche, coming?
-No, Ronnie, no!
You coming?
What for? l'm already buried in the grave of every man killed at Duck Lake.
-They're bound to find you.
-With your help?
No, they don't never find. l fix so you don't tell nothing. l won't turn you in, but April's got a right to know.
Why don't you let me stay dead?
Because you're not a coward.
Whiteman, ride horse with white face.
Go quick, Crow.
Go get him.
Viva Canadian womens, fly my heart, fly high!
Viva Canadian womens, who has so sweet the eyes!
Who has so sweet the eye!
Who has so sweet the eye!
Ronnie?
He's gone to Batoche. l loaned him my horse.
Ronnie!
Ronnie!
Ronnie!
Ronnie...
Kill...
Kill...
Kill...
How much l morn for you...
Love does funny things to people.
Captain Gower of the Canadian Militia is here to help us get what facts we can concerning the ambush at Duck Lake before the General convenes his court martial.
Yes, sir. l'm the one to blame.
Not my brother. l sent her to him, sent her to warn him.
Miss Logan, none of us are on trial.
We're only trying to find out what happened. l should have known Louvette would lie to him.
-That she...
-That she was in love with him and would persuade him to run away with her.
That's not true!
Ronnie wasn't afraid of anything. lf he's alive, he'll come back. l'm very sorry but the evidence we've gathered is conclusive.
Sergeant, you are personal assignment is to keep after Logan until you've place him under arrest.
Yes, sir.
-That is all!
-Capitan Gower...
-What is it?
-l don't know. Someone got killed.
Fall back!
Fall back there!
Constable Logan reporting.
Ronnie!
-Who is this man?
-An American Peace Officer,
Texas Rangers. ls this Constable Logan's body?
-Yes, sir.
-l don't understand.
This boy was captured. Look at his wrists where the thongs cut in.
They thought you ran away...
The man has been bound certainly. l don't know how he got loose but when l saw him he was free.
Maybe he could have got back to report but he didn't.
Because there was something he wanted more than he wanted his own life.
-What do you mean?
-l mean the Gatling gun.
What did Logan have to do with the Gatling gun?
The half-breeds had it on the bluff, commanding the south approach.
We saw what happens to troops who rush a gun like that.
But the kid could rush it because he was on the inside of their lines.
Now you all decided he quit his post.
Where l come from we don't jump to conclusions. lt's liable to be a fellow's last jump. l can tell you every move the boy made.
And l can tell you this, if you'd had 3 more men like him you'd have put down your rebellion in 24 hours.
He got their boats in the river to pull the crew away from the gun, then he got a horse and dragged the gun off riding like a bat out of hell.
The half-breeds spotted him but he got the bluff above the river.
Bullets were as thick as flies but they didn't stop him over he goes, horse, man, and gun rolling like a Texas twister over the sheer drop.
That's where l find him.
That's where you'll find the gun at the bottom of the river.
He never gave up.
He never quit.
He never ran away from anything because it wasn't in him to run.
He just kept going on like l think you'd want him to.
Constable Logan shall receive the highest military honors. l'll mention Logan's bravery to General Middleton.
Where were you all this time? l was squeezed under a log so tight l was breathing on the installment plan.
Shall l include that in my letter to your Texas Commandant? l hope you won't. l'll be in trouble enough without Corbeau.
Dusty!
You're an angel in leather. l'd look funny with leather wings. l'm sorry l misjudged a brave man.
Yes, we... all are.
Sergeant!
You will deliver prisoners
Riel and Corbeau to Regina.
-Last stop before Regina.
-Long way to ride
-before a hanging.
-They don't think so.
You be tying a wet knot.
Eight days with them traveling 200 miles.
Cold molasses could move faster.
Thank you.
-Where's Jim?
-Went riding with April. lf l should disappear, you know, vanish will you tell April l'll be back for her? lf you're as blind on the trail as you are with your lassie you'll never find your way back. l could never manage one of these contraptions. lt's a shame to waste it.
Either the hand of fate or someone thinks you ought to shave?
Well?
No, one maybe can get through, but there's no chance for two.
Find your own finish. l'm ready for mine whatever it may be. l'll have my knife back now. l give it to you!
No, sunny side up.
Now we're heading back for Texas. l hid your horse under that silver mine you call a saddle.
Just a minute, cowboy!
Going somewhere?
Don't look like l'm going very far.
Come on out, April. lt's nobody but Dusty taking a little ride.
Just trying to get away from it all.
Can we ride a little way with you, Dusty?
Why yes, ma'am.
Do Canadians ever go snow blind in the summer?
We're all a little blind sometimes. l'm not.
There's talk some fellow may try to get Corbeau away from us.
-How's that again?
-lt's only 100 miles from the Montana border.
And no telegraph. ls that so? l'll check when l get back. lf anyone's missing l'll have every man in the troop after them. l can't say l blame you.
Jim, Dusty seems a little restless.
Maybe he's thinking about a man who moved in on a friend that trusted him.
Sneaked in behind his back like a weasel in a hen coop and stole the one thing his friend valued most.
No, l wasn't thinking about that.
Wouldn't you say he'd loathe his friend for doing such a low contemptible thing to him?
He'd certainly owe him an apology.
Well? l apologize.
You apologize?
Jim's trying to tell you that he's taking something he thought belonged to you.
You? lf l'm free.
She told me once, l'd be alright if something beat me to my knees. l've been brought down hard.
No, l'm the one who surrendered.
But l wouldn't change him. l guess l've just been having a beautiful pipe dream in the middle of a nightmare.
Sure.
Sure, you're free.
You got what we both want, l got what l came for. l'll say the Mounted Police are the greatest outfit l ever tangled with and the luckiest.
Texas Rangers are two fisted fighters themselves.
And one of them is the most magnificent liar in the world.
Goodbye, Dusty.
Texas is gonna miss you.
There'll always be a part of Texas in our hearts.
Come on, sweetheart.
Come on, sweetheart.
SubRip:diamarg
{10960}{10993}You promised.
{11099}{11168}Adios, Kashkin.|- Adios, Roberto.
{12296}{12341}BUNKER
{12424}{12478}Hola, Americano.
{12510}{12560}Hola. Hola.
{13520}{13586}Help yourself, Jordan.|- General Golz?
{13609}{13705}What an accent!|He even knows me in the dark!
{13715}{13807}That's all we have|in Spain now... accents.
{13817}{13877}Eh, Jordan?|- I was looking for you.
{13887}{13978}I saw you.|How did it go with the train?
{13988}{14016}Alright.
{14026}{14100}And Kashkin?|- He caught one.
{14145}{14209}He didn't want to be taken alive.
{14234}{14316}Oh, so it was like that?|- Yes. Murder.
{14326}{14417}Orders are orders.|- I still call it murder. - Well...
{14427}{14537}in this business, Jordan, remember|nothing. Nothing except the next job.
{14547}{14628}What's next? - A bridge.|- Oh, a bridge. - Right.
{14638}{14766}To blow the bridge is nothing. But|to blow it at the time of the attack,
{14776}{14883}that's a horse of another color,|as you Americans say. - Attack?
{14893}{14997}Yes. At last we take the offensive.|Oh, it will be a beautiful attack.
{15007}{15088}On paper it looks wonderful,|and if it succeeds...
{15098}{15208}No, I will not say "if."|This time it must succeed and it will.
{15225}{15339}What I've told you, Jordan,|is known only to the general staff.
{15349}{15442}Our only chance to succeed|is by a surprise attack.
{15452}{15535}Now, here is the bridge,|over a deep gorge.
{15545}{15615}It's the only way|the enemy can bring up reinforcements.
{15625}{15721}Tanks, artillery, troops,|all must come over this bridge.
{15731}{15831}I must know it is gone. Not before|the attack, they'd rebuild it.
{15841}{15957}It must go the minute the attack|starts, no sooner, no later.
{15967}{16106}So the bridge is nothing. But suppose|their soldiers are sitting on it.
{16116}{16191}You know, sentries on both ends.|What do you do then?
{16220}{16355}In my country, they say, "Never blow|a bridge till you come to it." - Good.
{16365}{16462}That's good, you joke. In this|business, one should joke a little.
{16472}{16549}I am so serious.|It's why I can joke.
{16567}{16640}You think you can get through|enemy lines tomorrow night? - Sure.
{16650}{16733}Good. That will give you 3 days|to prepare for the dynamiting.
{16743}{16848}Wait for the attack at dawn,|after the third night.
{16858}{16931}How will I know the exact time?|- Well, use these.
{16941}{16995}Listen. First we attack from the air.
{17005}{17085}When you hear the explosions,|that's your time.
{17095}{17204}I've got a good guide for you,|an old man named Anselmo.
{17214}{17325}Knows the country like a fox,|and the people to help you.
{17335}{17402}Now, go|and find yourself a pretty girl.
{17463}{17534}But first get a haircut.|- Is that an order, General?
{17544}{17645}Why not?|- I don't like your barber.
{17764}{17845}Up the gorge to the left|is the bridge.
{18010}{18078}Sentry boxes, huh?|- At each end, Roberto.
{18088}{18151}Always two sentries on guard.
{18161}{18310}Where do the sentries live? - At the|road-mender's hut, across the bridge.
{18320}{18377}You can't see it from here.
{18387}{18474}The other post is on this side,|in that old sawmill.
{18540}{18612}How many men in the sawmill?|- Eight, and a corporal.
{18622}{18709}The other post, how many men?|- Maybe more.
{18719}{18772}We'll find out. Look!
{18975}{19038}They always spit in the gorge.
{19048}{19095}It brings luck.
{19138}{19210}I wish I could spit that far.
{19470}{19495}Roberto!
{19525}{19605}That sentry, he looks|like a man from my village.
{19619}{19681}He's very young.
{19784}{19898}He must die?|- You couldn't do it, Anselmo?
{19961}{20100}I would kill the sentry, considering|the necessity of the bridge.
{20110}{20220}But if I live later,|I'll try to live in such a way,
{20230}{20355}doing no harm to anyone,|that it will be forgiven.
{20556}{20619}Come on, let's get this dynamite|somewhere safe.
{21178}{21262}You wait here, Roberto.|- Oh, I can make it, Anselmo.
{21272}{21370}You want to be shot at,|carrying these?
{21380}{21437}No, not even in a joke.
{21462}{21510}Go ahead.
{21804}{21832}Roberto!
{22170}{22279}He's the boss here, Roberto.|Very strong man. - I can see.
{22289}{22375}Foreigner? - And a friend.|Didn’t the old man tell you?
{22385}{22435}I'm asking you.
{22559}{22620}I'm here for the Republic.
{22770}{22886}You know those seals, don't you?|SIM, Service of Military Intelligence.
{22896}{22968}The General Staff|commands for the Republic.
{22978}{23044}In these mountains, I command.|No one else.
{23190}{23264}What's that?|- Dynamite.
{23274}{23351}Good. I can use dynamite.|How much you bring me?
{23361}{23423}None. What's your name?
{23456}{23538}What's that to you?|- Pablo. He's Pablo.
{23548}{23626}What for?|- A bridge.
{23636}{23696}What bridge?|- That's my business.
{23706}{23810}In this country, it's my business.|- Don’t talk so! - You want to die?
{23820}{23929}No! - Shut your mouth.|- This comrade comes for the Republic!
{23939}{23970}Anselmo!
{23980}{24082}Help us get this stuff|up to your camp. The old man's tired.
{25073}{25145}Hola! What is this that comes?
{25155}{25234}The old man and a dynamiter.
{25450}{25540}Hey, that stuff! Not in the cave.
{25820}{25888}What're you making?|- A trap for foxes.
{25898}{26000}See? Very practical.|- He catches rabbits.
{26015}{26085}If a Gypsy catches rabbits,|he says it's foxes.
{26095}{26198}If he catches a fox, it's an elephant.|- And if I catch an elephant?
{26208}{26277}You'd say it was a tank.
{26287}{26358}I'll get me a tank, old man!
{26368}{26459}Some day I'll get me one|and you can call it what you please.
{26469}{26544}Gypsies talk much, kill little.
{26554}{26626}I'm going for wine.|- Bring a cup for me.
{26636}{26700}You have wine, huh?|- And plenty of it.
{26710}{26825}We eat like generals here.|- Yeah, he eats like ten generals.
{26835}{26925}And what do Gypsies do in the war?|- They keep on being Gypsies.
{26935}{27009}That's a good job.|- The best.
{27019}{27097}How do they call you?|- Roberto. And you?
{27107}{27263}Rafael. Oh, wine!|- There will be food soon.
{27273}{27308}Food!
{27333}{27390}Oh, you have tobacco!
{27774}{27816}Yeah, I know these.
{27841}{27916}Much air and little tobacco.
{28062}{28135}Ah, we eat!
{28206}{28234}Hola!
{28266}{28295}Hola!
{29050}{29088}That's how I comb it.
{29244}{29302}Go ahead and eat.
{29381}{29434}Hey, bread!
{30327}{30370}How are you called?
{30380}{30442}María. And you?
{30467}{30495}Roberto.
{30596}{30651}Been here long?
{30686}{30725}This long.
{30750}{30837}Three months.|They shaved my head in Valladolid.
{30847}{30954}I was on the train heading south.|- The train Pablo blew at Arévalo.
{30964}{31043}Many of the prisoners were caught|again, but they saved me.
{31063}{31199}They and Pilar. - We found her hiding|in the rocks where she'd run off.
{31209}{31273}You should have seen her!
{31292}{31362}No hair at all.|Cried all the time.
{31372}{31486}And if anyone touched her,|she'd shiver like a wet dog.
{31496}{31581}Man, but she was ugly.|- God's truth, Roberto.
{31591}{31725}Though Gypsies usually lie.|She looked like a half-drowned kitten.
{31842}{31908}You blow trains?|- I have.
{31933}{32012}Here?|- No, in Extremadura.
{32210}{32261}In another six months it'll grow out.
{32620}{32705}Are you his woman?|- Pablo's?
{32715}{32784}You've seen Pablo!
{32794}{32938}I've seen Rafael too.|- No. No, not the Gypsy.
{32948}{33052}This is a very strange woman.|Is of no one.
{33062}{33116}But she cooks well.
{33176}{33225}Really of no one?
{33346}{33381}No one.
{33418}{33454}Nor of you, either.
{33519}{33548}No.
{33567}{33634}No. I have no time for women.
{33684}{33715}No?
{33850}{33890}María!
{34145}{34185}Who's that?
{34243}{34300}Pablo's woman, Pilar.
{34310}{34397}She's something barbarous!|But brave!
{34407}{34481}A hundred times braver than Pablo.|- Pablo was brave in the beginning.
{34491}{34548}He killed more people than cholera.
{34558}{34647}Yes, at the start he kill more people|than the bubonic plague.
{34657}{34750}But, Pilar,|she is something barbarous!
{34760}{34894}The Gypsy's afraid of her.|- Why not? She hates me.
{34904}{34973}Why?|- She treats me as a time waster.
{34983}{35050}She doesn't like Gypsies.|- What an injustice!
{35060}{35182}She has Gypsy blood herself.|She knows of what she speaks.
{35192}{35324}But she has a tongue.|It bites like a bull whip.
{35334}{35450}What are you saying now, you lazy son|of an unmentionable Gypsy?
{35460}{35492}Answer me, Gypsy!
{35502}{35628}I was telling this comrade|what a kind woman you are, Pilar.
{35638}{35740}Liar! - This one comes as a dynamiter.|- I know that.
{35750}{35820}Go and relieve Andrés.|He's on guard at the top.
{35830}{35893}I go, Pilar.|I'll see you, Roberto,
{35903}{35993}when we eat. - Not even in a joke!|3 times today you've eaten.
{36003}{36135}But I can eat twice more.|- Get out of here! And send me Andrés!
{36197}{36235}Hola, Inglés.
{36245}{36303}How are you and the Republic?|- Good.
{36313}{36392}Both good.|- I'm happy.
{36402}{36506}What did that Gypsy say about me?|- He said you were much woman.
{36516}{36571}And I'd say he's right.
{36615}{36702}And what did you say to the girl,|before I came out? - Nothing.
{36712}{36828}I saw how she was from seeing you.|- I only joked with her. - Jokes?
{36838}{36943}Listen to me, Inglés.|She's young, not hardened as we are.
{36953}{37048}And she's had a bad time.|You understand?
{37058}{37145}Yes, I guess so.|- I'm worried about her.
{37155}{37253}When do you leave here?|- In three days. If I'm still alive.
{37263}{37362}What made you say that?|That never brings luck.
{37372}{37425}Let me see your hand.
{37494}{37573}Well?|- Nothing.
{37583}{37692}I saw nothing. What do you come for?|Blow another train?
{37702}{37759}No, a bridge.|- All the better.
{37769}{37838}Now we have horses.|Let's blow all the bridges and go!
{37848}{37940}I'm sick of this place. We are rotting|here because there's no fighting.
{37950}{38070}Only watching Pablo get drunk.|This life is ruining him.
{38080}{38155}What did you see in my hand?|- I saw nothing.
{38165}{38200}Yes, you did.
{38229}{38345}I'm only curious. I don't believe|in it. - In what do you believe?
{38355}{38436}In my work.|- I saw that. - What else?
{38446}{38475}Nothing else.
{38500}{38580}The bridge is very difficult?|- No. It is important.
{38590}{38644}But it can be very difficult?|- Yes.
{38665}{38740}I'm going to look it over again.|How many men have you got here?
{38750}{38852}Five. The Gypsy is worthless,|although his intentions are good.
{38862}{38939}Pablo, I no longer trust.
{38992}{39130}Thanks. I like your way of speaking.|- I try to speak frankly.
{39140}{39217}Then tell me what you saw in my hand.|- No.
{39240}{39299}I saw nothing else.
{39330}{39435}Go now to the bridge.|I look after your equipment.
{39445}{39544}Let me tell you again, Inglés.|I'm glad you've come.
{39554}{39617}We will understand each other.
{41095}{41160}Can they not dwell outside?
{41254}{41328}I don't want dynamite in here.|We have fire.
{41344}{41400}It's far from the fire.
{41474}{41503}Smoke?
{42080}{42137}How goes the Gypsy?
{42147}{42207}Is she going to let you eat again?|- Why not?
{42301}{42421}Is there wine?|- Not much left.
{42473}{42539}Then I'll have some water.
{42589}{42654}María, is there any water left?
{43195}{43269}It's too strong,|or I'd give you some.
{43279}{43336}I'd offer it to you, Pablo,|but there's not much left.
{43386}{43456}I have wine.|- What drink is it?
{43466}{43534}Medicine, you wanna taste it?
{43544}{43591}What's it for?
{43601}{43675}It changes your ideas.|- Yeah?
{43850}{43949}Bitter as gall! I'd rather be sick|than have the medicine.
{43959}{44056}That's the wormwood.|I'm glad you don't like it.
{44094}{44148}What are you saying there?
{44178}{44273}I was explaining the medicine.|- María!
{44415}{44517}What's that?|- The bridge showing the construction.
{44527}{44574}Look how it seems.
{44604}{44684}Why, it's the bridge itself!
{44701}{44778}How do you blow a bridge?|- That's what I'm figuring out.
{44788}{44815}No!
{44850}{44973}I don't go for the bridge.|Neither me nor my people.
{45031}{45108}Then we'll do it alone. Old one?|- Yes.
{45118}{45215}Without this coward.|- Hey, you! What did you say?
{45225}{45297}Nothing for you. I spoke to Roberto.
{45609}{45705}My orders are to blow the bridge.|- And I say no!
{45715}{45766}In these mountains we hide.
{45784}{45922}I take care of my people.|Live one place, fight somewhere else.
{45932}{46013}Fight, raid, blow trains, bridges,|but way off.
{46044}{46161}Not here where they will hunt us.|- You'll clear out. You've got horses.
{46212}{46285}I have 5 horses and 8 people.
{46295}{46390}You and the old man|with the loud mouth make ten.
{46416}{46528}Now if this bridge is blown,|we will be hunted.
{46538}{46625}Hunted from the earth, from the air.
{46661}{46757}The explosions will fall|from the sky on my horses.
{46767}{46850}Until you had horses,|you were one of us.
{46860}{46927}Now you're rich with horses,|you want to retire.
{46937}{47024}A lie! You know|I expose the horses for the cause.
{47034}{47112}To eat well, yes.|To steal, yes.
{47122}{47209}To murder, yes.|To fight for the Republic, no!
{47219}{47285}You are an old man|who will make trouble with his mouth.
{47295}{47417}I am an old man not afraid to fight.|I'm an old man without horses.
{47427}{47486}You might not live long.
{47496}{47576}I'm an old man|who will live until I die.
{47673}{47723}You will blow no bridge here!
{47768}{47818}No?|- No.
{47828}{47868}No bridge.
{47927}{47952}Pilar!
{47983}{48091}What do you say?|- I am for the bridge.
{48107}{48193}And for the Republic.|- What's that, woman?
{48272}{48375}I am for the bridge and against you.|Nothing more.
{48405}{48509}What do you say, Primitivo?|- I am also for the bridge.
{48524}{48549}Fernando?
{48559}{48674}To me the bridge means nothing.|I'm for the woman of Pablo.
{48700}{48754}Andrés!|- Yes, equally!
{48838}{48893}The same, Pilar.
{48911}{49000}Then we blow the bridge|and retreat to the Gredos afterwards.
{49010}{49093}You with your head of a bull|and heart of a hawk!
{49103}{49176}You think there'll be|any "afterwards", from this bridge?
{49186}{49251}I am for the Republic|and the Republic is the bridge!
{49261}{49349}It means nothing|to be hunted like a beast
{49359}{49441}after this thing|which brings no profit?
{49469}{49526}Nor even to die for it?
{49536}{49612}Don’t try to frighten us, coward!
{49636}{49731}Coward?|Is it cowardly to know what's foolish?
{49741}{49860}Or am I a leader for nothing?|Haven't I gotten you this far alive?
{49870}{50005}This foreigner comes to do a thing|for the good of the foreigners.
{50015}{50068}For his goal you want to sacrifice us!
{50078}{50192}I'm for the good and safety of all.|- Safety!
{50202}{50245}There is no such thing.
{50255}{50407}Did I spend 9 years with matadors|not to learn about fear and safety?
{50417}{50495}Speak to me of anything but safety!
{50505}{50590}Look at him.|How I believed in him once.
{50600}{50730}And look what he is now.|From a year of war you've become lazy,
{50740}{50798}a drunkard and a coward.|- Woman!
{50808}{50925}You have no right to speak like that.|Not before my people and a stranger.
{50935}{51029}Do you still believe|you command here?
{51055}{51085}Yes.
{51100}{51200}Here I command!|- Here I command!
{51210}{51337}Haven't you heard them?|Here no one commands but me now.
{51362}{51445}I should shoot you|and the foreigner both.
{51510}{51579}Try it and see what happens.
{51589}{51704}Listen to me, drunkard!|You understand now who commands?
{51714}{51810}Why, I command!|- No! Listen!
{51820}{51881}Take the wax from your ears.
{51891}{51941}Listen well.
{51951}{52020}I command.
{52315}{52351}Alright.
{52374}{52430}You command.
{52554}{52646}And if you want,|he can command too.
{52687}{52774}Maybe I am lazy|and drink too much.
{52784}{52898}Maybe you think I'm a coward,|though you know better.
{52908}{52946}Maybe.
{52956}{53024}But I'm not stupid.
{53100}{53224}Now if you're a woman as well as|a commander, show us something to eat.
{53249}{53280}María!
{53390}{53452}Take the food.
{54204}{54303}You must be careful.|- Pablo? - If you sleep, yes.
{54355}{54410}I'll watch out. What's he doing?
{54420}{54518}Only drinking. There will be danger|if he begins to hide the sadness.
{54606}{54681}If he pretends to be friendly,|then he's made a decision.
{54691}{54767}I heard Pilar say it.|- What kind of decision?
{54777}{54867}Who knows? After what's happened,|it'd mean danger for you.
{54900}{54996}I'll look after myself.|I'm thinking about the bridge.
{55020}{55082}I'm thinking about you, Roberto.
{55135}{55162}Why, María?
{55238}{55302}Well, I don't know.
{57096}{57155}Did I muss it?
{57198}{57270}All day I wanted you to do that.
{57294}{57340}I too, María.
{57984}{58025}Where's Pablo?
{58058}{58185}Ah, he's gone to the horses.|Now you have to kill him.
{58195}{58283}Kill him before he kills you.|- He won't kill me.
{58293}{58375}We waited for you to kill him.|Why didn't you?
{58385}{58474}And turn Pilar against me?|She's in control here.
{58484}{58579}So, he takes the horses and goes.|What about your bridge then?
{58605}{58659}You don't know Pablo.
{58745}{58829}Now men,|you have tightened your garters.
{60225}{60258}You, my friend,
{60268}{60366}you know I'm not a coward.
{60380}{60462}You are no woman, no fool.
{60547}{60629}Nor any colt of a girl either
{60639}{60715}that makes a man crazy with hunger.
{60725}{60857}You don't lie, make insults,|and leave me, like my people.
{60882}{60997}Yes, eat, my friend.
{61017}{61134}Pay no attention to the woman.|You know who commands.
{61159}{61188}You and me,
{61198}{61355}we'll show them who's stupid.|Not me, not you, my friend.
{62091}{62127}Get out of sight!
{62353}{62430}Ours?|- German and Italian.
{62455}{62519}Can they see the horses?|- They're not looking for horses.
{62529}{62626}Man! I could see their faces!|- I spit in their faces!
{62636}{62700}I spit in the milk of their mothers!
{62710}{62831}I tell you they could see the horses.|- Wipe the sweat from your face.
{62841}{62919}They could see the cigarette butts.|- Huh?
{62975}{63061}Hey, wait! They may be back!|- Coward!
{63071}{63116}Go to your horses!
{63126}{63250}Have you seen planes like this before?|- Never, Inglés. - Get inside.
{63355}{63460}I'm going with Pilar to El Sordo.|We've got to have more horses.
{63470}{63551}You know your sentry posts.|Keep a close watch.
{63561}{63693}Anselmo, write down everything|that passes along the road.
{63720}{63827}I can't write, Roberto.|- I'll show you how to write.
{63837}{63909}Look how Roberto can make pictures.
{63930}{63993}That's a truck, see?
{64003}{64082}And here's a soldier on a horse.
{64110}{64171}Look! Tank!
{64229}{64343}I will catch me|a tank like that, old man.
{64460}{64555}Whatever passes, make a mark.|The man on the horse is for cavalry.
{64565}{64657}Each mark means a troop|of twenty mounted men. Understand?
{64667}{64807}Each troop a mark.|- In this way I can write, yes.
{64817}{64886}That's an educated pencil.
{64905}{64985}Use one paper for each direction.
{64995}{65064}Tonight I'll know then|what they're moving up to the front.
{65074}{65154}Better get along,|and take some food with you.
{65188}{65241}Can I write too?
{65263}{65341}Watch the bridge and sentry posts.|See if more soldiers are brought,
{65351}{65431}and at what intervals|the guard is changed.
{65441}{65514}What is "intervals"?
{65524}{65629}How many hours|the sentries stay on and when they go.
{65654}{65723}Without a watch?|- Take mine.
{65784}{65908}What a watch!|Look at what a complication.
{65918}{65988}It should be able to read and write.|- Don’t fool with it.
{65998}{66113}Can you tell time?|- Why not? 12 o'clock day... hunger.
{66123}{66208}6 o'clock night... drunk.|With luck.
{66244}{66356}Ten o'clock now.|- You don't need to be a clown.
{66366}{66444}Do what I tell you|and keep out of sight.
{66482}{66571}Salud, Gypsy. Did you see|the air machines? - See them?
{66581}{66651}We ate them for breakfast!
{66661}{66744}Is there food, Pilar? I'm hungry.
{66754}{66825}It's a long walk from La Granja.
{66887}{66981}La Granja?|- Yes, Roberto. You wish tobacco?
{66991}{67062}You?|- Didn’t you sleep here last night?
{67072}{67170}For a while, yes. Then I thought|of my woman and children in La Granja.
{67180}{67251}Then I went there.|- Wasn't that dangerous?
{67280}{67397}You have to get past their sentries.|That's why I only go at night.
{67407}{67465}Oh, María!
{67539}{67625}See much movement on the road?|- Nothing.
{67635}{67735}A few trucks as usual. Cars.|A few guns, as usual.
{67745}{67820}No troops.|- Pick up any news in town?
{67830}{67879}But nothing.
{67940}{68041}Still goes battle in the north.|That's not news.
{68051}{68160}Oh, yes... there is talk|of the Republic preparing an attack.
{68185}{68261}What?|- That we are preparing an offensive.
{68299}{68324}Where?
{68334}{68397}Perhaps here or near Navacerrada.
{68407}{68476}Have you heard of it?|- Who told you that?
{68486}{68576}Who?|Surely you know how rumors fly?
{68586}{68698}The officers talks in the cafes|and the waiters listen.
{68719}{68796}They say this is|an offensive of some size, but...
{68806}{68854}it's only a rumor.
{68895}{68928}What else did you hear?
{68952}{68995}Nothing, man.
{69059}{69200}There is some talk of the Republicans|wanting to blow the bridges, but...
{69224}{69323}Are you joking?|- This one doesn't joke, Inglés.
{69333}{69389}Bad luck he doesn't.
{69404}{69488}A man like me|is never alarmed by rumors, Pilar.
{69498}{69558}Remember anything more?|- No.
{69583}{69697}They talk as usual of soldiers to be|sent to clear us out of the mountains.
{69707}{69783}There is some talk troops are|on the way. But it's always like that.
{69793}{69914}It's not important.|Only rumors as usual.
{69924}{69987}Rumors! Everything as usual!
{69997}{70050}Things are bad in the north,|as usual!
{70060}{70142}That troops come|to hunt us out, as usual!
{70152}{70210}An offensive here, as usual!
{70220}{70306}Man, you are a monument|to "as usual".
{70316}{70375}But the last two, Pilar,|are only rumors.
{70385}{70459}My mother!|- Let's go, Pilar.
{70497}{70575}Who'll look after my things?|- The man of rumors.
{70585}{70670}Fernando, guard the explosives.|- Very well, Pilar.
{70680}{70798}Calm yourself. There is nothing|to worry about. Only rumors.
{71632}{71660}Wait!
{71797}{71841}Hello, María.
{71874}{71918}Hello, Roberto.
{71958}{71988}Inglés!
{72148}{72191}Hola, Pilar!|- Hola!
{72250}{72343}Joaquín! - María! - Tell Sordo|I'm coming with Inglés!
{72364}{72452}A good boy, Inglés.|El Sordo saved him
{72462}{72582}when his family was killed,|and now they are like father and son.
{72632}{72740}Inglés, tell me,|have you known many women?
{72765}{72845}They meant nothing.|- I think you lie.
{72855}{72967}Well, maybe... a little.|- And for this one, for María,
{72977}{73055}you care much?|- Let's get on.
{73306}{73422}What is the reason for the bridge,|Inglés? Will there be an attack?
{73471}{73564}And the airplanes this morning?|Does that mean the enemy's found out?
{73574}{73630}They're preparing a counterattack?
{73640}{73727}I only know one thing for certain.|- What? - You have to shout.
{73737}{73837}One thing is certain. The bridge|must go when the attack starts.
{73847}{73933}And to do that we've got to have|more horses and more men.
{73989}{74033}When do we blow it?
{74081}{74116}Day after tomorrow!
{74126}{74187}Why not tonight?
{74197}{74225}Orders.
{74308}{74378}How do you get whiskey?|- Make it!
{74388}{74451}No, I joke.
{74461}{74557}This is good whiskey,|we got it on a raid.
{74567}{74665}No ice. Plenty ice up there.
{74690}{74728}Too far.
{74897}{74981}Easier blow the bridge tonight.|- I'd be shot for it.
{74991}{75035}Do it in daylight, we'll all be shot.
{75045}{75141}Not if we have horses.|- Hmm? - Not if we have enough horses.
{75151}{75209}We'll be out of here before they come.
{75219}{75305}I have five horses and four men.
{75315}{75454}Five men, Sordo.|- So it is. Five with the boy.
{75464}{75516}Five men and five horses.
{75526}{75640}That's ten horses for 15 people.|We've got to have five more horses.
{75650}{75723}For the retreat, yes.|Otherwise we won't make it.
{75733}{75818}How can you get horses?|- Steal 'em.
{75828}{75960}Only soldiers have horses now.|Soldiers and thieves like us.
{75970}{76086}Can you get five more tonight?|- What? - Tonight!
{76096}{76175}We can try.|- Good.
{76204}{76303}Maybe not so good.|Not good if it snows.
{76313}{76380}Horses make tracks|and soldiers follow tracks.
{76390}{76484}It is too late for snow, Sordo.|- Hmm? - It's the month of May!
{76494}{76553}And the sun is shining.
{76563}{76704}Look at the young general.|Already he's stealing horses.
{76714}{76812}He's always talking, Pilar, how|he carried the girl from the train.
{76822}{76895}Let's see|you carry her down the hill, my boy.
{76905}{76943}Now you make fun of me.
{77048}{77132}Wait, Joaquín!|I'll carry you on my shoulders.
{77278}{77313}Look, Inglés!
{77323}{77403}Look at the bullfighter.|He's crying.
{77420}{77485}Don’t mock, Pilar.|He was telling me about his sister.
{77495}{77583}She was a prisoner as I was,|and he just heard that she's dead.
{77631}{77701}I'm your sister now, Joaquín.
{77711}{77802}We all love you.|We are your family. - Yes.
{77812}{77906}Including the Inglés. Is that right?|- Of course.
{77916}{77993}You hear that, boy?|The Inglés is your brother.
{78003}{78085}We're all brothers, Joaquín.|- Thank you, Inglés.
{78095}{78165}Don’t worry.|I'll get you a horse tonight.
{78175}{78261}One for María too.|- What about me?
{78271}{78400}Do I have to kiss you too? It's been|years since I kissed a bullfighter.
{78410}{78500}Hold this, Inglés,|till I get a good kiss at him.
{78525}{78610}Look at him! He's afraid of a kiss|as he was afraid of the bulls!
{78620}{78664}No need to joke.
{78674}{78778}When I kiss, it won't be as a sister.|This trick of kissing as a sister!
{78788}{78843}Don’t be so brutal, Pilar!
{78853}{78916}I love you very much,|but why do you speak so brutally?
{78926}{78984}Why do you think, girl?
{79165}{79285}Rest, Pilar! You are tired.|- Shut up! Nobody asked your advice!
{79295}{79358}You think I'm an old woman.
{79396}{79437}Sit down.
{79573}{79625}Many things tire me.
{79687}{79775}And one of them|is to be old and ugly.
{79800}{79905}And another is to see a boy panic|when I joke that I might kiss him.
{79915}{80065}It's not true. You didn't see that.|- What d' you know, with your face?
{80075}{80151}I have an evil temper today,|and I'm jealous.
{80161}{80215}How foolish.
{80240}{80323}I'm an ugly old woman,|and I love you very much, child.
{80347}{80392}I love you too. You're not ugly.
{80402}{80500}Go on, I'm not ugly!|I was born ugly.
{80541}{80606}Do you know how an ugly woman feels?
{80616}{80686}Do you know what it is|to be ugly all your life
{80696}{80771}and feel beautiful in here?|- You are beautiful.
{80781}{80867}Try to use your head|and not your heart, and listen.
{80877}{80968}I'm telling you things of much|interest. Does it interest you?
{80990}{81074}María's right.|- Two of a kind!
{81084}{81207}You are a prize for any woman.|If you'd ever let go of yourself.
{81217}{81263}And this one...
{81285}{81408}this one is a gift to any man,|if she could cook a little better.
{81455}{81517}Give me a cigarette and listen.
{81527}{81592}Life is very curious.
{81631}{81783}I would have made a good man,|but I'm all woman and all ugly.
{81793}{81906}Yet many men have loved me.|Is that strange?
{81916}{81992}I don't think you're ugly.
{82017}{82133}Don’t lie to me.|Or has it begun to work with you too?
{82181}{82258}No, no, no. Look, I am ugly.
{82285}{82395}Yet one can have a feeling here|that blinds a man while he loves you.
{82420}{82526}He thinks you are beautiful,|and one day, for no reason at all,
{82536}{82674}he sees you ugly, as you really are.|And he's not blind any more.
{82710}{82783}Then you see yourself|as ugly as he sees you.
{82793}{82868}And you lose your man|and your feeling.
{82944}{83005}Then one day the feeling,
{83015}{83143}that idiotic feeling that you are|beautiful, grows inside of you again.
{83166}{83274}And another man sees you|and thinks you're beautiful.
{83284}{83357}And it's all to do over again.
{83442}{83575}Now I am past it.|But it still might come again.
{83624}{83683}Lift your head,|this silliness is over.
{83693}{83812}I was only jealous of your 19 years.|It isn't a jealously that lasts.
{83822}{83880}You won't be 19 always.
{83935}{84025}You see,|I have evil thoughts, Inglés.
{84039}{84166}If I were 19, I'd take you away|from this cropped head,
{84176}{84244}even with my ugly face.
{84339}{84435}No, no, sit there. I have a surprise|for you. Close your eyes.
{84445}{84568}You too, Inglés.|No, tightly, both of you.
{84928}{85000}Pilar, wait!|- Shut up, Inglés!
{85010}{85100}I'm bored with both of you!|- Pilar!
{85165}{85244}Let her go, Roberto.
{85483}{85562}Don’t you want to be alone with me?|- Of course.
{85607}{85675}And I want to be with you, Roberto.
{85704}{85804}Pilar knows it. She knows everything.|- I'm beginning to believe it.
{85814}{85900}Will she be alright?|- You don't have to worry about her.
{86036}{86126}It's a wonderful day, Roberto.
{86147}{86241}What are you worrying about?|- About you.
{86251}{86350}Me? Why?|Because I'm so happy?
{86375}{86450}I wish you weren't here, María.
{86485}{86513}I mean it.
{86545}{86612}I'm thinking about what will|happen to you after the bridge.
{86661}{86723}Can't I go with you?
{86783}{86909}El Sordo will get us horses for sure.|I know we need them for the escape.
{86919}{87013}You've got to understand, María.|I'm in this war to the finish.
{87023}{87088}I can't have|anything serious in my life.
{87098}{87175}A man doing what I'm doing|never knows what's going to happen.
{87185}{87252}Whatever happens to you|will happen to me.
{87317}{87375}Haven't you anyone in the Republic?
{87385}{87451}No relatives all?|You must have people somewhere.
{87490}{87587}My father and my mother,|I saw them killed.
{87654}{87770}My father was the mayor of our town|and a Republican.
{87780}{87895}When the Nationalists came, they lined|up the Republicans against the wall.
{87918}{88009}My father cried out very loud,|"Long live the Republic!"
{88019}{88055}And then they shot him.
{88065}{88188}But my mother was not a Republican.|She had no politics.
{88207}{88285}But she loved my father|and she couldn't say that.
{88295}{88448}So she just looked at my father|who lay there at her feet, and said,
{88458}{88545}"Long live my husband|who was the mayor of this town."
{88626}{88709}She said it very loud,|like a shriek,
{88719}{88816}and then they shot and she fell,|and I wanted to got to her,
{88826}{88960}but we were all tied by the wrists|in a long line of girls and women.
{88970}{89033}And I wanted to be shot too|and say, "Long live the Republic
{89043}{89104}and my mother and my father."
{89195}{89258}Instead, there was no more shooting.
{89285}{89419}They herded us up the hill|and through the streets
{89429}{89480}to the square.
{89558}{89663}My father's office|was in the city hall,
{89725}{89840}but they took us|across the street to the barber shop.
{89865}{89939}I want to tell you.|- No. Don’t.
{90498}{90529}Roberto...
{90564}{90601}are you angry about something?
{90631}{90675}Of course not.
{90749}{90793}I'm glad.
{90855}{90917}I won't cry any more.
{91044}{91088}Oh Roberto...
{91122}{91155}I like...
{91165}{91250}I don't know how to kiss|or I would kiss you.
{91345}{91406}Where do the noses go?
{91455}{91534}Always I've wondered|where the noses would go.
{91624}{91684}They're not in the way, are they?
{91694}{91750}I always thought they would be.
{91775}{91857}Look, I can do it myself.|- María.
{91885}{91940}Did I do it wrong?
{92480}{92526}Look, Pilar!
{92536}{92604}Roberto fell in the brook.
{92667}{92732}Already she makes you blind, Inglés?
{92958}{93019}Can't even see where you're going.
{93185}{93291}Hola, Inglés.|Come sit down here where it's warm.
{93490}{93585}I'll take your shoes and put them|in the smoke of the fire to dry.
{93937}{94025}Hey, don't burn them. I don't want|to stand around here barefooted.
{94143}{94267}María, fetch me some dry socks.|- The lord and master.
{94300}{94377}Here's the key.|The pack is locked.
{94387}{94450}Who's on guard at the top?|- Agustín.
{94502}{94564}Put these on. Dry your feet well.
{94624}{94700}You can't dry them with your hair?
{94710}{94771}What a swine.
{94781}{94843}Hit him with a chunk of wood, María.
{94858}{94933}I'm joking because I'm happy.|- You are happy?
{94943}{95011}Yes. I think everything goes well.
{95110}{95190}Keep this under your feet|until your shoes are dry.
{95200}{95331}Must you care for him as a child?|- No. As a man who's cold and wet.
{95341}{95420}And a man|who has just come home to his house.
{95445}{95516}Take the coffee, worthless one.
{95573}{95681}Does it always grow dark this early?|- No, Inglés. It's the weather.
{95691}{95779}The wind is very disorderly.|- Getting colder out.
{95789}{95898}Yes, Inglés. It is not correct|to be so cold in the month of May.
{95960}{96030}Any movement on the road, Anselmo?|- Not much.
{96040}{96155}It's all marked on the papers.|- Gypsy, what about the bridge?
{96165}{96258}Six hour interval.
{96283}{96365}I stayed till they changed the watch,|at noon and at six.
{96375}{96479}It was a long watch, Inglés. And cold!
{96489}{96567}My... my bones brea...
{96596}{96695}How about the sawmill post?|- Eight men and a corporal.
{96705}{96814}No more arrived.|- What about the road-mender's hut?
{96851}{96970}I didn't get that far. I remembered|what you said. To be careful.
{97038}{97134}Only ten cars?|- All written down, Roberto.
{97144}{97188}Inglés!
{97524}{97578}How do you like it, Pilar?
{97640}{97697}Very beautiful, the snow, huh?
{97707}{97770}Get out of my sight!
{98125}{98184}God help El Sordo.
{98220}{98328}If it snows all night,|it may cover his tracks. - Lf, if!
{98670}{98732}How do you like it, woman?
{98742}{98860}How do you like to command|when it snows? - Shut up, drunkard!
{98917}{99002}I know why you went to see El Sordo.
{99019}{99138}Horses make tracks in the snow,|hey, Inglés? Yeah.
{99237}{99379}Now there will be no offensive.|No bridge. No. Just snow.
{99389}{99417}Yeah.
{99440}{99523}And no making love in the heather!
{99556}{99620}Watch your mouth!
{99776}{99818}No. Let me.
{99947}{99972}María!
{100230}{100304}Wipe the table clean, María!
{100314}{100380}Wipe your own spillings!
{100467}{100563}Wipe first your chin, drunkard,|and then the table!
{100625}{100704}Pay no attention to him. He's drunk.
{100719}{100786}Fix my shoes, María.
{100979}{101060}Are you really drunk?|- Why not?
{101070}{101126}But not too drunk to watch your mouth!
{101362}{101437}No one on guard at the top?|- In this storm?
{101447}{101515}What for? No soldiers will move|in these mountains tonight.
{101533}{101574}Pilar, bring me something hot to eat!
{101708}{101733}Wine, Inglés?
{101764}{101875}I thought I was Roberto.|- I call you Inglés before the others.
{101885}{101918}Roberto?
{101943}{101992}Don Roberto!
{102033}{102170}How is Don Roberto?|- Fine, Don Pablo. How's Bacchus?
{102195}{102246}Who is Bacchus?
{102256}{102315}You know. Your constant companion.
{102325}{102376}I don't know such a man.
{102407}{102536}You say funny things, Inglés.|- Sure, I do. I'm a laugh a minute.
{102546}{102638}Pay no attention. He's drunk.|- Tell us, Inglés,
{102648}{102726}why have you come so far|to fight for our Republic?
{102808}{102936}A man fights for what he believes in,|Fernando. - In his own country.
{102950}{103058}Maybe you feel I'm sticking my nose|into other people's business,
{103068}{103178}but I don't feel that way.|It's not only Spain fighting here.
{103201}{103281}It's Germany and Italy|fighting Russia.
{103291}{103393}And the Spanish are right in the|middle of it. The Nazis and fascists
{103403}{103497}are against democracy|and against the communists.
{103507}{103577}They're using your country|to test their new war machinery.
{103587}{103733}Their tanks and dive-bombers. So they|can destroy democracies like England,
{103743}{103821}France and my country before|we get armed and ready to fight.
{103831}{103878}Were you always a Republican?
{103920}{104033}And your father?|- Sure. He always voted Republican.
{104065}{104115}Did they shoot him for it?
{104125}{104220}No. They don't shoot you|for being a Republican in America.
{104230}{104309}Roberto was a professor.|He told me this afternoon.
{104319}{104385}Not a professor, María. An instructor.
{104395}{104472}That's the same thing.|He was a teacher in a college.
{104482}{104609}The professor has no beard.|He's a false professor.
{104619}{104705}Shut up!|What did you teach, Inglés?
{104715}{104810}Spanish.|That's how I got to know Spain.
{104820}{104890}No beard. He has no beard.|He's a false professor.
{104900}{105003}Stop it! - Wouldn't it|be easier to teach English?
{105013}{105098}Why shouldn't he teach Spanish?|Doesn’t he speak it?
{105108}{105238}Yes, but in a way it is undignified|for a foreigner to teach Spanish.
{105248}{105293}I mean nothing against you, Inglés.
{105303}{105385}He doesn't teach it to Spaniards!|- I should hope not...
{105395}{105503}Let me finish, you mule!|He teaches Spanish to Americans.
{105547}{105670}Can't they speak Spanish?|- Mule! North Americans speak English!
{105680}{105771}No beard, no beard.|- Enough!
{105781}{105858}But he's got no beard. Beard...
{105868}{105934}No beard.|- He does have a beard.
{105969}{106014}You should know, girl.
{106024}{106111}Pay no attention, Inglés. He's drunk.|- I don't think he's so drunk.
{106121}{106212}Yes. Yes, I am drunk.
{106239}{106276}I doubt it.
{106286}{106338}Cowardly, yes!
{106476}{106543}You try to provoke me, Inglés?
{106598}{106661}No, you won't get rid of me that way.
{106685}{106739}I said cowardly, not drunk!
{106758}{106852}See? See, I don't provoke.
{106862}{106930}Signal to the woman|that you've failed.
{106940}{107055}Pilar had nothing to do with it.|You spoke to the girl as a coward.
{107065}{107116}I don't provoke.
{107171}{107299}See, woman? I teach the professor|I don't provoke.
{107390}{107487}I'll still be alive,|when you're all dead!
{107765}{107800}I'm not stupid.
{107810}{107865}I don't provoke.
{108205}{108269}I don't provoke.
{108549}{108673}To the Professor,|to the Señora commander,
{108692}{108804}and to all the illusioned ones.
{108860}{108964}That's silly.|It's a waste of good wine.
{109022}{109060}I don't provoke.
{109188}{109231}I am drunk.
{109241}{109338}The wise man gets drunk|to spend his time with fools.
{109351}{109376}Get out!
{109386}{109411}Yeah.
{109421}{109473}Yeah, I go.
{109554}{109660}I'll go to the horses.|They have more sense than men.
{109884}{110023}Tell them about the bridge, Professor,|and how to escape afterwards.
{110073}{110170}Who will lead your patriots|in the retreat? - Get out!
{110753}{110807}It's still falling, Inglés.
{111062}{111139}Let me go! I'll kill him!|- Give me that rifle!
{111254}{111332}Why didn't you kill him last night?
{111342}{111433}What do you think he'll do now?|- He will toss a bomb in here.
{111443}{111529}Give me your pistol. I'll shoot him.|- You want to blow us up?
{111539}{111635}What fools we are!|- Why didn't you kill him last night?
{111645}{111700}He's got to die now!
{111725}{111761}Pilar?
{111792}{111839}What do you say, Pilar?
{111864}{111895}Yes.
{111931}{111981}Whatever you will,
{112006}{112050}I'm for it now.
{112107}{112194}Then let all speak.|Andrés, what do you say?
{112204}{112279}Yes, kill him!|- Kill him.
{112296}{112335}Primitivo?|- Kill him.
{112345}{112416}Agustín?|- Do you need to ask? Kill him!
{112439}{112575}Fernando? - Don’t forget, Inglés,|he's smart and he knows the mountains.
{112585}{112669}Who will lead our retreat|after the bridge? - El Sordo!
{112679}{112790}He knows the way. Pilar, tell him|that El Sordo will lead us.
{112800}{112889}Couldn't we hold him as a prisoner?|- Who would look after him?
{112899}{112974}He is right, Fernando.|It would take us all to watch him.
{113016}{113088}Why not sell him to the enemy?|- Shut up, Gypsy.
{113098}{113175}That's filthy!|- No worse than Pablo.
{113211}{113302}If you'd blind him,|he will be easy to handle.
{113312}{113372}Watch your tongue, Gypsy!
{113382}{113450}Didn’t Pablo blind the civil guard|who was wounded?
{113460}{113523}Speak of blinding again|and you go with Pablo.
{113547}{113618}Pilar,|I haven't been allowed to finish yet.
{113628}{113675}Finish, then, finish!
{113685}{113752}I still maintain we need Pablo.
{113762}{113876}We should reason with him and point|out that his conduct... - Stop it!
{113886}{113974}Even here one man can make|a bureaucracy with his mouth!
{114021}{114142}You've voted to kill him.|Now have done with it!
{114219}{114313}Kill him when he returns.|- He must make the first move.
{114323}{114450}Why wait? Kill him! - In cold blood?|- You Ingleses are all cold.
{114460}{114515}Give me your gun! I'm burning!
{114525}{114602}Not in here. No shooting in here.
{114660}{114760}You'll see how cold my blood is|when that coward comes back!
{114990}{115060}Ugly. All of it's ugly!
{115209}{115326}Remember one thing, Inglés.|He wasn't always like this.
{115348}{115418}When the war broke out,|he wasn't the man you see now.
{115428}{115519}Brutal, yes,|but a leader without fear.
{115541}{115624}Without Pablo's help, the Nationalists|would have taken our town
{115634}{115729}the day the revolution began,|for many Nationalists lived there.
{115739}{115820}But Pablo organized the people,|and in the night
{115830}{115959}all suspects were dragged from their|beds and locked up in the city hall.
{115969}{116053}In the dark,|he surrounded the police barracks,
{116063}{116183}cut the telephone wires|and placed dynamite under the wall.
{116193}{116277}When morning came, he called on|the civil guards to surrender,
{116287}{116374}but they wouldn't.|So he blew the wall open.
{116554}{116632}But then there was a shout|for us to stop firing
{116642}{116722}and four civil guards|walked out with their hands up.
{116732}{116848}Pablo said, "Show us how to die,|you who have always done the killing."
{116858}{116943}"What are you going to do?",|the officer asked. "Shoot you."
{116953}{117015}Pablo passed behind them.
{117025}{117175}I can hear the pistol even now|and see the head of each man fall.
{117185}{117256}One held his head still|when the pistol touched it.
{117266}{117350}One shivered in his whole body|and his head was shaking.
{117360}{117458}Only one put his hands in front of his|eyes and he was the last one.
{117468}{117606}The hat fell from his head|and Pablo said, "Pilar, he's polite.
{117616}{117687}He takes off his hat|for a woman like you!"
{117800}{117898}A crowd was gathering|in the plaza before the city hall.
{117918}{117971}"Why is it done this way?",|they asked Pablo.
{117981}{118079}"To save bullets," he said,|"and to make all of you share in it."
{118089}{118165}I had picked up that hat|and a man said,
{118175}{118307}"Pilar, that's bad taste.|We're done with civil guards now."
{118475}{118543}Drunkards yelled,|as if at a bullfight,
{118553}{118615}"Let the bull out!|Pablo, let the bull out!"
{118625}{118705}And then everyone shouted,|"Here comes the first one!"
{118715}{118793}It was Don Perito García, the mayor.
{118803}{118903}He walked between the lines|and nothing happened.
{118913}{118996}He passed two men, four men,
{119006}{119079}eight men, and nothing happened.
{119089}{119189}From the roof someone shouted,|"What's the matter, coward?"
{119199}{119241}But nothing happened.
{119251}{119306}I was watching one man|who had a dispute with the mayor
{119316}{119395}about a piece of land,|and who hated him.
{119405}{119475}And it was this man|who first raised his flail.
{119849}{119925}Don Faustino Rivera|was known as an annoyer of girls.
{119935}{120038}He wanted to be known as a bullfighter|and went much with them and Gypsies.
{120048}{120109}But he was a coward|and was considered a joke.
{120119}{120211}But he was inspired by the example|of Don García and he stood there
{120221}{120315}looking handsome and brave,|and he made his face scornful.
{120325}{120398}Now the lines began to shout,|"Listen Don Faustino,
{120408}{120525}there are beautiful girls over|the cliff, why don't you chase them?"
{121269}{121344}It was then I knew|that the lines had become savage,
{121354}{121495}caused by the insult of Don García|and the cowardice of Don Faustino.
{121505}{121612}Don Guillermo wasn't a bad man. He was|only in politics because of his wife.
{121622}{121691}I heard her screaming, "Guillermo,
{121701}{121768}husband, wait. I'll go with you!"
{121794}{121886}He couldn't see her without his|glasses, but he looked up and waved.
{121896}{121960}And no one would hit him.
{121970}{122037}Then a drunkard yelled,|"Guillermo!"
{122385}{122505}"What bothers Pilar?", they asked me.|"I'm sick," I told them.
{122515}{122631}And they said, "Us too.|We'll take no further part in it."
{122641}{122700}But the worst was yet to come, Inglés,
{122710}{122829}when Pablo opened the city hall door|and let the mob in to kill the rest.
{122850}{122988}For yes, it was now a mob,|lacking any organization.
{123137}{123185}The snow has stopped, Inglés.
{123195}{123252}Now we'll have|good weather for the bridge.
{123262}{123325}Yes, I've come back to help you.
{123335}{123399}I cannot desert Pilar and my people.
{123432}{123467}Wait, man!
{123710}{123811}What trick is this, drunkard?|- No trick, Pilar.
{123821}{123879}I've changed my mind, that's all.
{123889}{123994}You're right about the bridge|and I'm with you now.
{124004}{124117}You'll need me for the retreat.|- Just what I said.
{124127}{124165}You were listening!
{124175}{124265}You're afraid of being killed.|That's why you've changed.
{124275}{124402}Do you think I like to hear|how we killed those men?
{124412}{124495}If I could bring them back to life,|I'd do it. - Liar!
{124505}{124598}No, I mean it. I wish|I could bring them back to life,
{124608}{124675}even Don Ricardo who cursed me.|- Stop it!
{124685}{124786}Yes, I would restore them all to life.|That's God's truth.
{124846}{124947}And it's also true|that I'm with you now.
{124987}{125038}I was drunk.
{125048}{125137}Now I'm not drunk|and I've changed my mind.
{125147}{125300}Either trust me or not, but no one|can get you to the Gredos as I can.
{125310}{125400}I believe you.|But take an oath.
{125410}{125515}Are you with us and for the bridge?|- Yes, man.
{125537}{125649}You think it can be successful despite|the snow? - There will be no snow.
{125659}{125713}You have confidence?
{125738}{125778}Why not?
{125805}{125871}Fools! Lunatics!
{125881}{125960}You're all crazy if you believe him!
{134067}{134135}What, Roberto?|- A trooper.
{134160}{134245}What does it mean?|- I don't know.
{134473}{134540}See anything?|- No.
{134578}{134645}Are you sure it was a trooper?|- Yes.
{134655}{134716}Where's Pablo?|- In the cave.
{135771}{135865}Man, what a horse!|- Never mind, get in the saddle.
{135881}{135976}This horse must make tracks out again.|- You have much sense, Inglés.
{135990}{136058}I'll ride him in the hills|until the snow's melted.
{136068}{136140}Keep your eyes open.|There's bound to be more cavalry.
{136150}{136240}Get the machine gun and my binoculars.|We've got to cover the pass.
{136250}{136324}Both of you give him a hand.|Go back to that soldier
{136334}{136394}and see if you can find more clips.
{136404}{136472}And leave his pockets alone!
{136575}{136655}Roberto! Roberto, I'm coming with you!
{136665}{136735}Go back. Tell Pilar to pack.|We may have to run for it. - No.
{136745}{136825}Go back, María. There may be a fight.|- I'll help you. - No!
{136835}{136904}Let me help you.|- Go back!
{136914}{137000}Let me go with you. I want to help.|- Then go back!
{137045}{137085}Kiss me.
{137116}{137181}You're shameless.|- Yes.
{137930}{138003}What's happened to that Gypsy?|- I saw him coming down.
{138013}{138076}Then he saw a rabbit|and went after it.
{138154}{138265}Fine time to go hunting. Primitivo,|climb up that rock as high as you can.
{138275}{138351}If you see soldiers,|throw a stone for a signal. Wait.
{138361}{138432}If you see one soldier, raise|your rifle like this. - Like this?
{138442}{138543}If more than one, pump it like this.|One for each soldier. Understand?
{138553}{138580}Yes.
{138599}{138744}Anselmo, go to Agustín and hold|the gun's legs, if I have to shoot.
{142245}{142371}Here, hold this for me. - For what?|- I'm liable to shoot me a Gypsy.
{142421}{142507}Look! Now we'll have fresh meat.
{142517}{142601}See?|Does something annoy Roberto?
{142611}{142706}If you weren't a Gypsy, I'd shoot you!|- But why?
{142716}{142795}Look at how fat they are!
{143057}{143083}Get down!
{144785}{144856}Rifles!|- Now the soldiers are hunting.
{144935}{144970}Wait here.
{145240}{145316}Is it Pablo?|- El Sordo.
{148010}{148115}Come, Inglés, now they need us.|- Where? - To join in with El Sordo.
{148125}{148195}To die there?|Don't you realize they're lost?
{148205}{148288}It's too risky.|We have to think about the bridge.
{148298}{148378}Why that's our friend El Sordo!|- Listen... - I listen to that!
{148388}{148454}Are you afraid|to fight for our friends?
{148865}{148907}Roberto!
{149105}{149182}We could hear the firing at the cave.|I was afraid...
{149192}{149282}You shouldn't have come here.|- I let her. She was half crazy.
{149292}{149358}She thought you were fighting.|- Why aren't we fighting?
{149368}{149468}They want to go to El Sordo.|- Have you lost your minds?
{149478}{149532}What kind of locos are you?
{149542}{149621}Men, not women!|- Then act like men!
{149631}{149723}You'll die soon enough.|- Swallow your tongue and choke!
{149733}{149763}Silence!
{149773}{149847}What use is courage|if you have no head?
{149857}{149957}El Sordo has both.|He'll understand.
{149999}{150052}Was he coming with the horses?
{150062}{150190}Looks like he did his best|to lead them away from us.
{150320}{150412}Did you hit him?|- Pot full of grease-backed bat.
{150422}{150483}I'll tell you|who's a pot full of grease:
{150493}{150570}Pilar. She knows we are dying here.
{150580}{150678}What could Pilar do?|- Take them from the rear. - How?
{150688}{150815}They're all around the hill.|100, 200... maybe more now.
{151000}{151089}Bandidos, cobardes! Can you hear me?
{151099}{151156}You sons of four-legged devils!
{151175}{151271}Surrender now, you bandits,|before our planes blow you to bits!
{151311}{151385}Will they send planes?
{151423}{151522}With bombs or machine guns?|- Both, my son.
{151572}{151655}I'm giving you a chance to surrender|before the planes come.
{151665}{151719}You hear what I am saying, bandidos?
{151729}{151801}Let's insult him.|Maybe he'll show his head.
{151811}{151938}Do you surrender?|- Who has a big pistol? - Here.
{151966}{152068}The planes are coming!|Do you surrender?
{152090}{152199}He can't wait for the planes.|He wants to be a hero,
{152209}{152272}to lead us back|with a rope around our necks.
{153201}{153286}Have you seen any movement since the|shots? - No sir.
{153296}{153375}What do you think?|- I don't believe it.
{153385}{153460}Why shouldn't they do it?|They knew they had to die.
{153470}{153526}It's better than being bombed|or captured, isn't it?
{153536}{153604}I think it's a trick.|What about the planes?
{153614}{153702}They should have come a long time ago.
{153712}{153797}How many shots did you count?|- Five. - It's ridiculous
{153807}{153929}if they are dead! Ridiculous|to hide down here from dead men!
{153939}{154017}I think we should wait|for the planes, sir.
{154141}{154211}Fire, cowards, if you are alive!
{154221}{154302}Fire on a man|who has no fear of you!
{154312}{154390}Shoot, you saffron-bellied swine!
{154524}{154627}Now do you believe me?|No one's alive up there.
{154637}{154715}You! Go up and see.
{154747}{154863}Don't you hear me?|- Yes, my captain. - Then go!
{154873}{154969}Do you hear me? - Yes, my captain.|- Why don't you go then?
{154979}{155067}I don't want to, my captain.|- You don't want to?
{155077}{155150}I'm afraid, my captain.|- Captain Mora! - Lieutenant Berrendo!
{155160}{155240}It is possible the soldier is right.|- Right to say he's afraid?
{155250}{155354}Right to say he wants to disobey?|- No sir. Right that it's a trick!
{155364}{155475}Don't you hear me, they're all dead.|- You mean our comrades on the slope?
{155485}{155597}I agree, sir.|- Very well, the sniper stays here.
{155607}{155695}I'll take care of him later.|You and I will go to the top.
{155705}{155811}Not me. - What? - I will go|if you order me. But under protest.
{155821}{155981}No, I'll go alone. The smell|of cowardice is too strong here.
{156044}{156101}Assassins! Cowards!
{156111}{156171}Shoot me! Kill me!
{156186}{156283}Can you hear me coming?|No, you can't hear me coming.
{156293}{156393}You think I'm a coward|like the others? Shoot me!
{156403}{156484}Kill me!|- "Shoot me! Kill me!"
{156494}{156554}Cowards!|- Look at him coming.
{156564}{156640}Scum of the earth! - What an animal!|- Shoot me if you are alive!
{156650}{156742}Look at him stride.|- Bandidos! - This one is for me.
{156752}{156850}Do you hear me? - This one|we take with us. - No, you don't hear.
{156860}{156924}Keep walking.|- Cowards!
{156934}{157031}Look at the stars. He's a captain.|Stick out your chest, little captain.
{157041}{157145}I will kill you with a bullet!|- Don't stop. Don't be late, captain.
{157155}{157225}You vermin!|- A long voyage...
{157235}{157303}Fire! Cowards!|If you are alive! Come on.
{157331}{157420}Now comrade voyager, close enough.|Come on, voyager.
{157430}{157467}Can you hear me coming?
{157477}{157530}No, you can't hear me coming.
{157540}{157587}I am coming.
{157775}{157832}"Kill me! Shoot me!"
{158449}{158485}Joaquín!
{158509}{158535}Quick!
{158634}{158668}A little higher!
{159613}{159640}Pilar!
{160320}{160353}Pilar!
{161648}{161691}Hola, Pilar.|- Hola.
{161701}{161750}Salud, Roberto.|- Salud.
{161949}{161990}Salud, Pilar.
{162006}{162081}Look at him. Already at the wine!
{162091}{162165}Did you come back for us, or the wine?|- Both.
{162175}{162233}He came back for his horses.
{162259}{162388}Much riding, Inglés. I couldn't turn|back till the snow has melted.
{162420}{162538}Didn't you run into the cavalry?|- A good horse, the new one.
{162548}{162640}I took to high ground|and came back through the hills.
{162692}{162765}No food, Pilar? Where have you been?|- Guarding the pass below.
{162775}{162852}We had to wait|until there was no more cavalry.
{162868}{162893}Inglés!
{162957}{163036}Inglés! I was with El Sordo.
{163151}{163218}You were in the fight?|- No.
{163252}{163307}On my way back here...
{163317}{163430}It was dark and I went up the hill.
{163500}{163617}Five dead at the top.|They'd taken their heads.
{163662}{163706}Joaquín too?
{163770}{163834}No heads...|- Now let the fighting come.
{163844}{163896}No heads.|- Inglés!
{163906}{163979}Anselmo says there is|much movement across the bridge.
{164004}{164078}I was just leaving the lookout|when it started. - What?
{164088}{164205}Guns, trucks, armored cars,|even tanks. - Tanks?
{164215}{164338}Everything moving up toward the front.|I marked it all down.
{164363}{164450}I waited till the second column had|crossed. - Anything more coming?
{164460}{164574}Yes, I could hear another column|as I came up through the pass.
{164584}{164665}Should I go back? - Not now.|Were these trucks full of soldiers?
{164675}{164731}Yes. What does it mean?
{164741}{164860}They know the Republic is going|to attack when the sun rises.
{164870}{164961}Yes, now they know.|They move up to meet our offensive.
{164983}{165043}Who knows the way through to the|Republicans? - I do.
{165053}{165141}I need you at the bridge. Who else?|- I know it.
{165151}{165240}Have you been through before? - Twice.|- 8 hours, nearly 9 hours.
{165250}{165321}Can you make it to Navacerrada?|- I can try.
{165331}{165443}I could do it in less time, with luck|and no pack. - I need you here.
{165457}{165546}Our route was longer because|we carried explosive. It was safer.
{165556}{165685}I will get there as well as another.|And something could happen to anyone.
{165972}{166088}This dispatch is for General Golz.|Remember the name, "Golz".
{166098}{166178}Where will I find him?|- Ask when you get to our lines.
{166188}{166313}This seal ought to get you through.|If you have problems, show this here.
{166323}{166433}You've got seven hours at the most.|The attack is set for sunrise.
{166443}{166562}I prefer to be with you at the bridge.|- Get this to General Golz
{166572}{166640}and we won't have to blow the bridge.|We'll all escape to the Gredos safely.
{166650}{166746}Remember, the bridge's got to go|if the attack starts.
{166756}{166829}Pablo! Pablo, come back!
{166839}{166869}Pilar!
{166879}{166929}Pablo has gone!
{166946}{167031}Didn't I tell you he was a coward?|You and your confidence!
{167041}{167119}If it wasn't for you,|I would have killed him last night!
{167129}{167242}I have been betrayed.|- Betrayed! Listen to him!
{167252}{167351}He has been betrayed! You fool!
{167371}{167478}No slanders, please!|- Forget it! I'm the one to blame.
{167488}{167597}Andrés, you better get going.|And good luck.
{167694}{167762}Should I go back|and guard the horses?
{167772}{167838}Fool!|- No. I'll look after them.
{167848}{167915}Who will lead the retreat now?|- Shut up, Gypsy!
{167925}{168010}Andrés will get to the general.|- Get back in the cave. Pilar,
{168020}{168092}get everything ready for the bridge.|And get some sleep.
{168102}{168204}I'll look after the horses.|Look after my things.
{168549}{168578}Salud!
{168597}{168680}Don't shoot, comrades.|- Who are you?
{168705}{168779}A comrade, Andrés Lopez,|with a dispatch for General Golz.
{168789}{168900}Say the password, if you're a comrade!|- I don't know any password.
{168910}{168986}Toss a bomb at him.|- No, that would be a great mistake.
{168996}{169050}He's not alone, Pedro. Toss a bomb!|- No. Please.
{169060}{169143}I'm completely by myself.|Allow me to show you my papers.
{169153}{169277}Sure you're alone?|- How many times must I to tell you?
{169287}{169313}Stand up!
{169357}{169426}Put your hands above your head!
{169436}{169470}Come on!
{169592}{169694}I'm in a big hurry. I have a dispatch|for General Golz at Navacerrada.
{169704}{169794}Where? - Inside my shirt. How can I|show it to you with my hands up?
{169804}{169925}You're a long way from Navacerrada.|I will take you to Captain Gómez.
{169967}{170000}Spy!
{170595}{170670}I brought your robe.|I'll fix it for you.
{170811}{170881}Was this your idea or Pilar's?
{170891}{170980}Mine.|But Pilar told me to come.
{171085}{171174}Even if she'd told me not to come,|I would have come.
{171358}{171470}Will there be fighting tomorrow?|- Are you afraid?
{171503}{171602}I'm afraid for you so much|I do not think of me.
{171628}{171706}Pilar told me that|I'm to go with you, after the bridge.
{171716}{171812}That you'll take me to the Republic.|- You and Pilar will have horses.
{171822}{171900}You'll be safe with Pilar.|That leaves 3 horses for the others.
{171910}{171972}But I go with you, not Pilar.
{171982}{172060}I came on foot with the old man|and shall go the same way. - No!
{172070}{172152}Pilar says no one|will get out alive without a horse.
{172162}{172281}But if Andrés gets through,|there will be no bridge, will there?
{172311}{172358}Will there, Roberto?
{172407}{172446}No.
{172485}{172600}Maybe I should've sent word sooner|about the movements here.
{172812}{172859}How much time have we left?
{172893}{172935}A lifetime, María.
{173069}{173122}I mean until daylight.
{173190}{173245}Five, six hours.
{173285}{173364}Pilar told me|that time is not important.
{173374}{173425}Maybe Pilar's right.
{173435}{173541}Three days and three nights.|Yet they're everything.
{173551}{173665}Longer than the months in prison.|Longer than the years I've lived.
{173725}{173831}She told me something else|when I left the cave:
{173841}{173928}"We must live all our life|in the time that remains."
{173938}{174031}She said...|- What?
{174215}{174307}What did she tell you?|- We would all die tomorrow.
{174317}{174395}And that you know it too.|- She's crazy.
{174405}{174480}Nothing more than Gypsy superstition.
{174505}{174567}You don't believe it?|- Of course not.
{174631}{174732}She had a reason for telling me.|She said I must tell you all
{174742}{174808}that happened to me|when they shot my mother and father.
{174818}{174887}You've told me.|- No.
{174920}{174995}No, I didn't tell you what happened|when they herded us up the hill
{175005}{175070}and to the barber shop.|- I don't want to hear it.
{175080}{175136}Two men looked at me and one said,
{175146}{175207}"That's the daughter of the mayor."
{175234}{175336}The other said, "Commence with her."|They took me to the barber shop
{175346}{175430}and put me in the chair and held me.
{175474}{175545}In the mirror I could only see|my mother and my father
{175555}{175625}at the moment of the shooting.
{175635}{175754}My mother's words were in my head|like a scream that went on and on.
{175789}{175850}And I could fell a pain.
{175860}{175939}They were pulling at my hair|and cutting it off with a razor.
{175949}{176030}And then they put the braids|in my mouth...
{176040}{176115}and tied them around my neck|to make a gag.
{176125}{176220}Then they ran clippers across my head.
{176255}{176410}I commenced to cry, because until then|I'd been too frozen to feel anything.
{176442}{176521}In the mirror,|I could see the men laugh.
{176553}{176690}I couldn't look away from the horror|my face made with braids in my mouth.
{176830}{176915}When they took me out,|I stumbled over the dead barber.
{176925}{176996}They had shot him|because he belonged to a union.
{177006}{177125}Then I saw my best friend|being dragged in by two more men.
{177135}{177221}When she saw me, she screamed.|She screamed the whole time
{177231}{177285}they were shoving me|across the square
{177295}{177411}and into the doorway|and up the stairs of the city hall,
{177421}{177539}to the office of my father, where they|put me on the couch. - María.
{177625}{177750}The worst things were done there.|- Quiet. Don't think about it.
{177841}{177915}I was going to tell you|on the way back from El Sordo,
{177925}{178015}but I was glad|when you wouldn't let me.
{178025}{178107}Then I was happy,|as if it had never happened.
{178117}{178235}No. Tonight, Pilar said|I must tell you everything.
{178260}{178331}And now you won't love me.
{178365}{178485}Tomorrow you'll take me through the|lines and I'll never see you again.
{178495}{178575}Never. You won't want me.
{178627}{178700}No, Roberto,|we can't change things.
{178788}{178902}But it's true|I never kissed any man until you.
{178912}{179035}When it happened I fought until they|tied my arms. - No one's touched you!
{179070}{179145}You believe that?|- I know that.
{179180}{179235}And you can love me?
{179303}{179363}I can love you more.
{179920}{180010}I could see your headlight from afar.|You want to bring down a shelling?
{180020}{180104}Where is the lieutenant colonel?|- He's asleep. Who is the bandit?
{180114}{180181}He bears a dispatch for General Golz|who commands the attack.
{180191}{180298}You're crazy. I know no General Golz,|nor no attack.
{180308}{180397}Get back to your battalion.|- Call the lieutenant colonel.
{180407}{180448}Away!
{180458}{180496}Call him!
{180528}{180654}All you barbers are emotional.|Orderly!
{180731}{180847}Call the lieutenant colonel. Don't|forget, I'm your superior officer.
{180857}{180955}I'm not afraid of your threats. Cynics|like you would be eliminated...
{180965}{181069}"First" is the word you want.|- As long as they liquidate you.
{181079}{181170}"Liquidated" is a word foreign|to Spain. - Shot, then!
{181180}{181305}That's Spanish, can you understand it?|- Yes, but don't talk so loud!
{181315}{181372}Your emotions bore me.
{181403}{181468}Hello, Gómez.|- Colonel.
{181478}{181530}What brings you?
{181755}{181822}Why didn't this get here sooner?|- Stupidity.
{181832}{181911}I'm not sure|you can get through now.
{181921}{182028}Write them a very strong safe-conduct.|You'll need something strong tonight.
{182038}{182092}We're careful before an offensive.
{182102}{182151}You know|what I've been thinking about?
{182195}{182260}What I should do|to take care of you well.
{182270}{182385}I'll learn from Pilar|and other things you can tell me.
{182395}{182478}What about me taking care of myself?|- But you don't.
{182488}{182596}You should have hung out your|sleeping robe in the sun this morning.
{182606}{182725}Before the dew comes,|it should have been taken in. - Go on.
{182751}{182825}Your socks should be washed.|I would see that you have two pairs.
{182835}{182870}What else?
{182920}{183007}This. I would learn how to fire it.
{183017}{183133}That's easy. I'll teach you.|- Then if you're wounded,
{183143}{183199}I could kill you and then myself.
{183239}{183300}Do you have many ideas like that?
{183310}{183435}No, not many.|But it's a good one in this war.
{183460}{183540}Pilar gave me this one|and showed me how to use it.
{183550}{183620}I always keep it with me.|- Razor blade?
{183630}{183731}She says there's no pain|if you press quickly and firmly.
{183741}{183794}And they can't stop it if it's done.
{183804}{183908}Not if you cut the artery.|How long have you had it?
{183918}{183975}Ever since I was rescued.
{184050}{184138}But I'd rather have you shoot me.
{184148}{184236}Promise me if there's ever any need|that you will shoot me.
{184289}{184345}Sure. I promise.
{184377}{184495}Thank you very much.|I know it's not easy to do.
{184627}{184714}But there are other things|I can do for you.
{184732}{184807}Besides shoot me?|- Yes. I can roll cigarettes
{184817}{184938}when your box is empty.|- Without spilling tobacco? - Yes.
{184948}{185065}And if you're wounded, I'll take care|of you, wash you and feed you.
{185075}{185171}Maybe I won't be wounded.|- If you're sick,
{185181}{185295}I'll make soup and read to you.|- Maybe I won't get sick.
{185305}{185378}Then I'll bring you coffee.|- Maybe I don't like coffee.
{185388}{185484}This morning you had two cups.|- Suppose I get tired of coffee,
{185494}{185603}I'm not wounded or sick, I give up|smoking, have only one pair of socks,
{185613}{185675}and roll up my robe myself.|What then?
{185685}{185800}Then I'll cut your hair with Pilar's|scissors. - I don't like that.
{185810}{185912}Neither do I.|I like your hair the way it is.
{185960}{186118}So if there's nothing to do for you,|I'll sit by you and watch you.
{186128}{186194}And in the nights we'll make love.
{186289}{186332}You are shameless.
{186342}{186460}If you don't love me,|I love you enough for both.
{187398}{187450}I was asleep.
{187500}{187610}I'm sorry I woke up.|I didn't know I was sleeping.
{187620}{187740}It was so beautiful in your house.|- My house? - Yes.
{187765}{187867}In America. The one you told me about.|Where you were a little boy.
{187877}{187950}Does the stairway turn at the top,|like this?
{187960}{188058}And there is the door to your mother's|room? Yes, that's how it was.
{188068}{188128}Your mother was there,|and your grandfather
{188138}{188213}who fought in the American Civil War.|- He's dead.
{188223}{188325}He was there, just as you described|him. I liked him very much.
{188335}{188397}And I loved your mother.
{188407}{188534}She was holding a child|who looked exactly like my Roberto.
{188544}{188675}When I asked her whose son it was,|she said, "Why, it's yours, María."
{188820}{188915}That's why I had to look at you.|- Maybe you weren't dreaming.
{188925}{189021}No, I was there,|just as real as I'm here now.
{189031}{189115}Can't you wait till I take you there?|- Oh Roberto,
{189125}{189220}that, too, is like a dream,|like a wonderful dream.
{189293}{189403}My hair amuses you because it's odd.|But every day it's growing.
{189413}{189505}And it will be long|and I will not look ugly.
{189515}{189565}Perhaps you will love me very much.
{189676}{189773}All the things you've told me tonight,|it's... it's as if
{189783}{189865}you'd already taken me to Madrid|and to America.
{189875}{189947}That's just the beginning.|Wait till this war is over.
{189957}{190035}Do I please you?|Will you always take me with you?
{190045}{190159}Unless you run away from me.|- No, I'll never go away from you.
{190169}{190245}I loved you when I first saw you,
{190255}{190331}I always have,|though I never saw you before.
{190341}{190412}Now I'm your woman.|I'll always be your woman.
{190422}{190450}Always!
{190597}{190675}Where is the headquarters|of General Golz of the 35th division?
{190685}{190755}Not here. - I was told|he was in the vicinity. What is here?
{190765}{190847}The comandancia.|- Of what? - Who are you?
{190857}{190969}Captain Gómez of the 65th brigade|and I ask where is General Golz.
{191138}{191222}I can hear the wind in the trees.
{191288}{191350}Now it will soon be light.
{191403}{191457}Will we ever come back?
{191523}{191566}Some day, María.
{191625}{191720}And stay here again?|- Some day.
{191778}{191860}Do you think Andrés got through?
{191870}{191940}We can't tell until sunrise.
{192018}{192060}Are you afraid?
{192085}{192123}Not now.
{192168}{192243}I love you, Roberto.|Always remember.
{192263}{192342}I love you|as I love my father and mother,
{192352}{192429}as I love our unborn children,
{192439}{192533}as I love what I love most|in the world, and I love you more.
{192543}{192590}Always remember.
{192600}{192650}I'll remember.
{192687}{192768}Nothing can ever part us now, can it?
{192778}{192824}Nothing, María.
{192880}{192920}Inglés!
{192959}{192994}Inglés!
{193004}{193071}What is it, Pilar? What's wrong?
{193081}{193150}It must have been Pablo!|- Pablo's gone. What do you mean?
{193160}{193245}Your exploder!|The box that explodes the dynamite.
{193255}{193340}When I stirred up the fire for coffee,|I found it.
{193350}{193432}What? - It was under the ashes.|- I thought you were guarding it.
{193442}{193495}I slept with your things!|- You slept well!
{193505}{193582}He must have done it last night|before we got back.
{193592}{193661}Maybe it will work again.
{193735}{193822}Is there no other way to explode|the charges? - Yes, sure.
{193832}{193903}A bad way, but I can do it.|That swine!
{193913}{194010}What is the way, Inglés?|- Get me your hand grenades.
{194501}{194592}Do they always explode?|- Yes, but not strong enough.
{194602}{194694}I didn't ask that.|Have they always exploded? - Always.
{194855}{194990}I've brought 3 more men from the band|of Elias. - Traitor.
{195049}{195156}I've come back, Pilar, and I've|brought more men for the bridge.
{195193}{195267}Did you do that?|- I had a moment of weakness.
{195277}{195325}Kill him, Inglés!
{195385}{195433}Yes, I meant to leave.
{195443}{195575}Having seen what happened to El Sordo,|I was afraid to die.
{195585}{195700}But having done such a thing,|I was lonely.
{195710}{195815}Do you understand loneliness?|- I understand cowardice!
{195825}{195927}Don't mock me, woman.|Don't you see I've come back?
{195982}{196076}I've thought of a way|to explode the dynamite.
{196086}{196127}So have I.
{196137}{196235}The only reason I don't|shoot you is because we need you.
{196295}{196390}I've brought more men|for the bridge, Inglés.
{196445}{196576}They think I'm still the leader here.|Or they wouldn't have followed me.
{196705}{196807}You are if you wish. For the fighting.
{196826}{196950}I suppose when a man has something|once, always something remains.
{196975}{197059}Our men are waiting below.|Tell them we're coming.
{197069}{197171}Don't worry about the retreat.|Now we have three more horses.
{197181}{197295}And three more men!|- Maybe they won't need their horses.
{197591}{197643}You have much control, Inglés.
{197664}{197770}I'm glad he's back.|No matter what he is, we need him.
{197817}{197918}One last thing I must tell you.|In that thing of the hand...
{197928}{198020}What thing of the hand?|- No, listen. Don't be angry.
{198030}{198100}When I looked in your hand,|it was just Gypsy humbug.
{198110}{198202}Gypsies do that to make themselves|important. - Sure, sure. Forget it.
{198212}{198299}I don't want you to worry.|- Who's worrying?
{198309}{198424}The truth is, I saw only happiness|for you and the cropped head.
{198434}{198545}I know that.|And I don't need a nurse.
{198555}{198686}I care for you very much, Inglés.|Remember that and don't worry.
{198696}{198785}Everything will go well at the bridge.|- Sure. Let's go.
{198795}{198844}Get your things together.
{199783}{199860}Are the orders clear now?|- Yes. Take the road-mender's hut,
{199870}{199962}destroy the post and stop anything|from getting through to the bridge.
{199972}{200062}Right. But not a move unless you hear|the falling of bombs. - Yeah. Clear?
{200157}{200285}You, Pilar, the same with the sawmill.|Don't shoot unless we hear the bombs.
{200295}{200375}Don't alarm the sentries|unless you hear the bombs.
{200385}{200485}Don't worry about the retreat, Inglés.|We'll have plenty of horses.
{200495}{200557}Get along before he steals|the rest of your things.
{200567}{200645}You don't understand me, woman.|We understand each other.
{200655}{200752}Nobody understands you.|Neither God, nor your mother, nor I.
{200762}{200815}Nor you, either.
{200974}{201000}Come.
{201135}{201205}Goodbye. See you soon.
{201215}{201300}Goodbye, Roberto. Take much care.|- Of course.
{201363}{201401}Don't cry.
{201411}{201500}No, I don't. But come back to me.|- I will.
{201510}{201572}Don't worry if you hear firing.
{201582}{201643}Only come back quickly.
{201670}{201715}Bye, María.
{201740}{201787}Salud, Roberto.
{203806}{203879}Get across the gorge|and don't fire unless I do.
{203889}{203966}When the sentry is eliminated,|come to the middle of the bridge.
{203976}{204025}It is all clear to me.
{204063}{204135}I will do as you order.
{204203}{204325}When you fire, don't think of it|as a man, but as a target.
{204335}{204420}And if anything happens to me,|you'll have to finish the job
{204430}{204500}as I showed you.|Go now.
{204518}{204617}Until soon, Roberto.|- Until soon, Anselmo.
{207382}{207485}Captain Gómez, 65th brigade.|An urgent dispatch for General Golz.
{207495}{207620}Why didn't this get here sooner?|- Stupidity and crazy suspicion.
{207630}{207739}General Golz! Urgent!|But I just spoke to him.
{207749}{207825}Segovia? I'll try there.
{209456}{209540}No, no, no!|Get me position Ávila!
{209566}{209616}Where's General Golz?
{209641}{209680}Planes 1?
{209725}{209779}Get me Planes 1!|- Can't you call the airfield?
{209789}{209843}General Golz! Not there?
{209871}{209930}I called Segovia!
{209985}{210083}Get me Segovia again! Quick, man!|- Stop the bombardment!
{210093}{210140}You think I want to get shot?
{210810}{210908}Yes, Golz. Golz! General Golz?
{210930}{210997}From Jordan? Yes, read it.
{211052}{211077}What?
{211317}{211352}Too late, Duval!
{211362}{211474}That means we're done for.|This time we fail.
{211484}{211519}Too bad.
{211529}{211613}Yes, too bad.
{214935}{214965}Rope!
{215376}{215420}Hand grenade.
{216211}{216255}Other side!
{216589}{216684}Please have him be all right|because all my heart is at the bridge.
{216736}{216852}Please bring him back to me,|and I'll do anything you say, ever.
{216912}{217001}Because there isn't any me.|I'm only with him.
{217011}{217138}Please take care of him for me.|Take care of him!
{217210}{217304}Forgive me, for I'm very confused...
{217314}{217385}but if you take care of him,|I'll do whatever is right.
{217395}{217474}But this not knowing,|I cannot endure it.
{219025}{219115}Pablo, I got me a... a tank!
{219810}{219862}One.|- Two. - Three.
{219875}{219900}Four!
{220530}{220608}Alright. Now take the wire back|as far as it will reach
{220618}{220663}before I connect it.
{221800}{221825}Roberto!
{221983}{222030}Hurry, Roberto!
{222276}{222315}Hurry!
{222454}{222549}Blow it, Anselmo!|- No, I can't! You'll be...
{222559}{222640}Pull it, I tell you!|- No, Roberto!
{223860}{223922}María! María!
{223932}{223984}Your Inglés is alright.
{223994}{224065}Hear me? He's alright.
{224075}{224147}Yes, thank you. Thank you.
{224196}{224254}Thank you very much.
{224509}{224551}Roberto!
{225142}{225220}The old one?|- Dad.
{225230}{225351}We lost Fernando.|- If I'd had only had the exploder.
{225361}{225451}What's with Pablo?|- Maybe he can't leave.
{225461}{225569}Then let us leave! The devil with him!|- Wait! He'll be back if he's able.
{225888}{225915}Machine gun.
{225960}{225986}Here comes the...
{226106}{226167}Plenty of horses now, Inglés!
{226272}{226325}Where's Fernando?
{226335}{226385}And the old man?
{226419}{226470}Where are the three men of Elias?
{226540}{226629}What were you shooting in the gorge?
{226654}{226753}Why don't you say you shot them?|- Shut up! - Answer me!
{226763}{226809}I look after my own people.
{226819}{226905}And the men of Elias?|- They were not our people.
{226915}{226996}I provide horses for my people!|- We have horses to spare.
{227006}{227100}Yeah? How did I know|we would have three killed!
{227110}{227221}Now, shut up!|I lead the retreat.
{227748}{227792}No!|- Don't be stubborn, woman.
{227802}{227882}Watch the María.|- Watch yourself.
{228017}{228063}Look! There they are!
{229032}{229142}Wait for the next shot, then go hard|before they can reload. - No.
{229189}{229236}Now!|- No!
{230063}{230094}Roberto!
{230192}{230264}Roberto! Let me go!
{230405}{230442}Roberto!
{230521}{230615}What is it? Is it...|- It's broken. - Can you ride?
{230665}{230764}Get me a strip of canvas. Tear it|from one of the packs. - Yes.
{230855}{230935}Get me the machine gun.|You can make it if I hold 'em here.
{230945}{230985}No, Inglés. We'll carry you.
{230995}{231084}Don't argue. I can't ride. I couldn't|even sit on a horse. I'd...
{231094}{231162}I'd pass out.|Pablo know I'm right.
{231180}{231306}I want to talk to María alone.|But when I tell you to take her, do it.
{231316}{231411}Talk fast, Inglés.|The soldiers will soon be coming.
{231610}{231698}María, listen, don't say anything.
{231708}{231766}We won't be going|to America this time.
{231776}{231878}But always I go with you|wherever you go. Understand?
{231888}{231962}You go now, María.|- No, I stay with you, Roberto.
{231972}{232070}No, María.|What I do now, I do alone.
{232080}{232208}No. - If you go, then I go too.|Whichever one there is, is both.
{232218}{232310}No. No, I stay with you.|- No,
{232320}{232384}each of us must do this thing alone.
{232410}{232502}Do it for each other.|But if you go, then I go with you.
{232512}{232616}That way I go too. I know you'll go|now, María, for both of us,
{232626}{232703}because we love each other always.
{232713}{232806}It's easier for me|to stay with you, Roberto.
{232816}{232930}I know it's harder for you.|But now I am you also.
{232940}{233045}If you go, I go too.|That's the only way I can go.
{233055}{233135}You're me now.|Surely you must feel that, María.
{233160}{233275}Remember last night? Our time is "now"|and it'll never end.
{233297}{233370}No.|- You're me now and I am you.
{233411}{233495}Now you understand. Now you're going.
{233505}{233558}You're going well and fast and far.
{233568}{233636}We'll go to America|another time, María.
{233646}{233697}Stand up now and go. And we both go.
{233707}{233773}Stand up.|Remember, you're me too.
{233783}{233861}You're all there will be ever be of me|now. Stand up.
{233951}{234005}No. Stand up.
{234201}{234290}There's no goodbye, María,|because we're not apart.
{234300}{234326}Pilar!
{234475}{234510}Don't turn around.
{234520}{234570}Go now. Be strong.
{234580}{234633}Take care of our life.
{234812}{234865}No, Pilar, I can't go!
{234875}{234931}No! Oh Roberto!
{234941}{235050}Roberto, let me stay, please!|Please don't make me go!
{235144}{235210}No, Roberto, no!
{235479}{235607}God,|that was lucky I could make her go.
{235632}{235714}I don't mind this at all now.|They're away.
{235755}{235868}Think how it would be|if they'd got María instead of you.
{235895}{235955}Don't pass out, Jordan.
{235991}{236037}Think about America.
{236047}{236086}I can't.
{236096}{236148}Think about Madrid.
{236158}{236189}I can't.
{236199}{236258}Think about María.
{236330}{236357}I can do that.
{236735}{236860}No, you fool! You weren't kidding|María about that talk of "now"!
{236870}{236997}Now they can't stop us, ever!|She's going on with me! Yes! Right!

Sweet, juicy oranges.
O for a muse of fire, that would ascend the brightest heaven of invention, a kingdom for a stage, princes to act and monarchs to behold a swelling scene.
Then should the warlike Harry, like himself, assume the port of Mars.
And, at his heels, leashed in like hounds, would famine, sword and fire crouch for employment.
But pardon, gentles all, the flat, unraised spirits that hath dared on this unworthy scaffold to bring forth so great an object.
Can this cockpit hold the vasty fields of France?
Or may we cram, within this wooden O, the very casques that did affright the air at Agincourt?
On your imaginary forces work.
Suppose, within the girdle of these walls, are now confined two mighty monarchies whose high upreared and abutting fronts the perilous narrow ocean parts asunder.
Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts.
Think, when we talk of horses, that you see them printing their proud hoofs in the receiving earth.
For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings, carry them here and there, jumping o'er times, turning the accomplishment of many years into an hourglass - for the which supply admit me, Chorus, to this history, who prologue-like, your humble patience pray... gently to hear, kindly to judge our play.
My lord, I'll tell you.
That same bill is urged which, in the eleventh year of the last king's reign, was likely to have been against us passed, but that the scambling and unquiet times did push it out of further question.
But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?
It must be thought on.
If it pass against us, we lose the better half of our possession, for all those temporal lands which men devout by testament have given to the Church, would they strip from us - thus runs the bill.
- This would drink deep.
- 'Twould drink the cup and all.
By what prevention?
The King is full of grace and fair regard.
And a true lover of the holy Church.
The courses of his youth promised it not, since his addiction was to courses vain, his companies unlettered, rude and shallow, his hours filled up with banquets, riots, sports, and never noted in him any study.
And so the prince obscured his contemplations under the veil of wildness, which grew, no doubt, like the summer grass, fastest by night.
The breath no sooner left his father's body but that the wildness, mortified in him, seemed to die too.
Sir John Falstaff...
...and all his company along with him, he banished...
...under pain of death, not to come near his person...
...by ten miles!
Yea, at that very moment, consideration like an angel came and whipped the offending Adam out of him.
Never was such a sudden scholar made, never came reformation in a flood as in this king.
We are blessed in the change.
"We are blessed in the change"!
My good lord, how now for mitigation of this bill urged by the Commons?
Doth his majesty incline to it, or no?
He seems indifferent, or rather swaying more upon our part, for I have made an offer to his majesty, as touching France, to give a greater sum than ever at one time the clergy yet did to his predecessors part withal.
How did this offer seem received, my lord?
Of good acceptance of his majesty, save that there was not time enough to hear, as I perceived his grace would fain have done, of his true title to some certain dukedoms and generally to the crown and seat of France, derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.
What was the impediment that broke this off?
The French ambassador upon that instant craved audience...
...and I think the hour is come to give him hearing.
Is it four o'clock?
- It is.
- Then go we in to hear his embassy, which I could with a ready guess declare before the Frenchman speak a word of it.
I'll wait upon you and I long to hear it.
Where is my gracious
Lord of Canterbury?
- Not here in presence.
- Send for him, good uncle.
Shall we call in the ambassador, my liege?
Not yet, my cousin. We would be resolved before we hear him of some things of weight that task our thoughts, concerning us and France.
God and his angels guard your sacred throne and make you long become it.
Sure, we thank you.
My learned lord, we pray you to proceed and justly and religiously unfold why the Law Salic that they have in France or should, nor should not, bar us in our claim.
We charge you in the name of God, take heed how you awake the sleeping sword of war.
For never two such kingdoms did contend without much fall of blood, whose guiltless drops do make such waste in brief mortality.
Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers that owe your lives, your faith, your services to this imperial throne.
There is no bar to make against Your Highness' claim to France but this, which they produce from Pharamond.
"In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant" -
No woman shall succeed in Salic land - which Salic land the French unjustly gloze to be the realm of France.
Yet their own authors faithfully affirm that the land Salic lies in Germany, between the floods of Saale and of Elbe, where, Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons, there left behind and settled certain French who, holding in disdain the German women for some dishonest manners of their life...
...established there this law - to whit, no female should be inheritrix in Salic land, which is this day in Germany called Meissen.
Then doth it well appear the Salic Law was not devised for the realm of France.
Nor did the French possess the Salic land until four hundred one-and-twenty years after defunction of King...
...Pharamond, idly supposed the founder of this law.
King Pepin, which deposed Childeric, did, as heir general, being descended...
...of Blithild...
...who was daughter to...
...King Clotaire, made claim and title to the throne of France.
Hugh Capet also, which usurped the crown...
Er...
...of Charles, the Duke of Lorraine, sole heir male of the true line and stock of...
...of Charles the Great, could not keep quiet in his conscience, wearing the crown of France, till satisfied that fair... that fair... that fair...
Queen Isabel, his grandmother, was lineal of the Lady... of the Lady... of the Lady... of the Lady Ermengarde, daughter to Charles, the foresaid Duke of Lorraine.
So that, as clear as is the summer's sun...
...all hold in right and title of the female.
So do the kings of France unto this day, howbeit they would hold up this Salic Law to bar Your Highness claiming from the female.
May I with right and conscience make this claim?
The sin upon my head, dread sovereign, for in the Book of Numbers it is writ,
"When the son die, let the inheritance descend unto the daughter. "
Gracious lord, stand your own.
Look back into your mighty ancestors.
Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb from whom you claim.
Invoke his warlike spirit, and your great-uncle's,
Edward the Black Prince.
Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth do all expect that you should rouse yourself as did the former lions of your blood.
They know your grace hath cause and means and might.
So hath Your Highness.
Never king of England had nobles richer or more loyal subjects, whose hearts have left their bodies here in England and lie pavilioned in the fields of France.
O let their bodies follow, my dear liege, with blood and sword and fire, to win your right.
In aid whereof, we of the spiritualty will raise Your Highness such a mighty sum as never did the clergy at one time bring in to any of your ancestors.
Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.
Now are we well resolved, and by God's help and yours, the noble sinews of our power,
France being ours we'll bend it to our awe or lay these bones in an unworthy urn, tombless, with no remembrance over them.
Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure of our fair cousin Dauphin, for we hear your greeting is from him, not from the king.
May it please Your Majesty to give us leave freely to render what we have in charge, or shall we sparingly show you far off the Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?
We are no tyrant, but a Christian King, therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness tell us the Dauphin's mind.
Thus then in few.
Your Highness lately sending into France did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right of your great predecessor,
King Edward the Third.
In answer to which claim, the Prince our master says that you savour too much of your youth.
He therefore sends you, fitter for your study, this tun of treasure, and in lieu of this desires you let the dukedoms that you claim hear no more of you.
This the Dauphin speaks.
What treasure, Uncle?
Tennis balls, my liege.
We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us.
His present and your pains we thank you for.
When we have matched our rackets to these balls, we will in France, by God's grace, play a set shall strike his father's crown into the hazard!
Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler that all the courts of France will be disturbed with chases.
And we understand him well, how he comes o'er us with our wilder days, not measuring what use we made of them.
But tell the Dauphin we will keep our state, be like a king, and show our sail of greatness when we do rouse us in our throne of France.
And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his hath turned these balls to gunstones and his soul shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance that shall fly with them, for many a thousand widows shall this his mock, mock out of their dear husbands, mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down.
Ay, some are yet ungotten and unborn that shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.
But this lies all within the will of God, to whom we do appeal and in whose name tell you the Dauphin we are coming on to venge us as we may, and to put forth our rightful claim in a well-hallowed cause, so get you hence in peace.
And tell the Dauphin his jest will savour but of shallow wit when thousands weep more than did laugh at it.
Convey them with safe conduct.
Fare you well.
- This was a merry message.
- We hope to make the sender blush at it.
Therefore let our proportion for these wars be soon collected, and all things thought upon that may with reasonable swiftness add more feathers to our wings, for, God before, we'll check this Dauphin at his father's door.
Now all the youth of England are on fire, and silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies.
Now thrive the armourers, and honour's thought reigns solely in the breast of every man.
They sell the pasture now to buy the horse, following the mirror of all Christian kings with winged heels, as English Mercuries.
For now sits expectation in the air and hides a sword from hilt unto the point with crowns imperial, crowns and coronets, promised to Harry and his followers.
Linger your patience on, for if we may, we'll not offend one stomach with our play.
Well met, Corporal Nym.
Oh. Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph.
What, are Ensign Pistol and you friends yet?
For my part, I care not. I say little.
But when time shall serve...
I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends, and we'll all go three sworn brothers to France.
Let it be so, good Corporal Nym.
Well, I cannot tell.
Oh, it is certain that he is married to Nell Quickly, and certainly she did you wrong, for you were betrothed to her.
Things must be as they may.
Men may sleep, they may have their throats about them at that time.
- Some say knives have edges.
- Oh!
Well, I cannot tell.
Here comes Pistol and his wife.
Good corporal, be patient here.
How now, mine host Pistol?
Base tike...
...call'st thou me host?
Now, by this hand,
I swear I scorn the title.
Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers.
No, by my troth, not long, for we cannot lodge or board a dozen or fourteen gentlewomen that live honestly by the prick of their needles but it will be thought we keep a bawdy house. Straight.
O hound of Crete, thinks't thou my spouse to get?
I have, and I will hold, my honey queen.
And there's enough. Go to.
I would prick your guts a little, and that's the truth of it.
O well-a-day, Lady! We shall have wilful murder and adultery committed.
Good corporal, good lieutenant, offer nothing here.
- Pish.
- Pish for thee, Iceland dog.
Thou prick-eared cur of Iceland.
Good Corporal Nym, show thy valour, put up thy sword.
I will cut thy throat one time or another, in fair terms.
I can take. Now Pistol's cock is up, and flashing fire will follow.
Hear me, hear me what I say.
He that strikes the first stroke,
I'll run him up to the hilts, as I-I-I am a soldier.
An oath of mickle might, and fury shall abate.
Mine host Pistol, you must come to Sir John Falstaff, and you, hostess.
He's very sick and would to bed.
Good Bardolph, put thy nose between his sheets and do the office of a warming-pan.
- Away, you rogue.
- Faith, he's very ill.
By my troth, the King hath killed his heart.
Good husband, come home presently.
Come, shall I make you two friends?
We must to France together.
Why the devil should we keep knives to cut one another's throats?
Let floods o'erswell and fiends for food howl on.
You'll pay me the eight shillings
I won off you at betting?
Base is the slave that pays.
Now that will I have.
That's the humour of it.
As manhood shall compound.
Push home.
By this sword, he that makes the first thrust, I'll kill him.
By this s-s-s-sword I will.
"This s-s-s-s-sword".
And oaths must have their course.
Corporal Nym and thou wilt be friends, be friends.
An thou wilt not, why then be enemies of me too? Prithee, put up.
As ever you come of women, come quickly to Sir John.
He's so shaked of a burning contigion fever, it's lamentable to behold.
Sweet men, come to him.
The King hath run bad humours on the knight.
Nym, thou hast spoke the right.
His heart is fractured and corroborate.
The King is a good king, but it must be as it may.
He passes some humours.
Let us condole the knight.
For, lambkins, we will live.
Linger your patience on and we'll digest the abuse of distance, force a play.
The King is set from London and the scene is now transported, gentles, to Southampton.
There is the playhouse now, there must you sit, and thence to France shall we convey you safe and bring you back, charming the narrow seas to give you gentle pass.
But here, till then, unto Southampton do we change our scene.
# Amen #
Now sits the wind fair.
Uncle of Exeter, set free the man committed yesterday that railed against our person.
We consider it was the heat of wine that set him on, and on his wiser thought we pardon him.
- That's mercy, but too much security.
- Let him be punished, sovereign, lest example breed, by his sufferance, more of such a kind.
O let us yet be merciful.
We doubt not now but every rub is smoothed on our way.
Then forth, dear countrymen.
Let us deliver our puissance into the hand of God, putting it straight in expedition.
- Cheerly to sea.
- Hurrah!
- The signs of war advance!
- Hurrah!
No King of England, if not King of France!
Still be kind and eke out our performance... with your mind.
God save thy grace, King Hal.
My royal Hal. God save thee, my sweet boy.
My King, my Jove,
I speak to thee my heart.
I know thee not, old man.
Fall to thy prayers.
How ill white hairs become a fool and jester.
I have long dreamed of such a kind of man, so surfeit-swelled, so old and so profane.
But being awaked,
I do despise my dream.
Reply not to me with a foolish jest, presume not that I am the thing I was.
For God doth know, so shall the world perceive that I have turned away my former self, so shall I those that kept me company.
Prithee, honey sweet husband, let me bring thee to Staines.
No, for my manly heart doth yearn.
Bardolph, be blithe.
Nym, rouse thy vaunting veins.
Boy, bristle thy courage up.
For Falstaff he is dead, and we must yearn therefore.
Well, Sir John is gone, God be with him.
Would I were with him, wheresome'er he is, either in heaven or in hell.
Nay, he's not in hell.
He's in Arthur's bosom, if ever man went to Arthur's bosom.
He made a finer end and went away an it had been any christom child.
He parted e'en just betwixt twelve and one, e'en at the turning of the tide.
When I saw him fumble with the sheets, play with flowers, smile upon his finger ends,
I knew there was no way but one.
For his nose was as sharp as a pen.
And he babbled of green fields.
"How now, Sir John?" quoth I.
"What, man, be of good cheer. "
So he cried out, "Gone, gone, gone," three or four times.
Now I, to comfort him, bid him he should not think on God.
I hoped there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet.
So he bade me lay more clothes on his feet.
I put my hand in the bed and felt them.
They were as cold as any stone.
Then I felt to his knees and they were as cold as any stone.
And so... upwards... and upwards... and all was cold as any stone.
They say he cried out for sack.
Ay, he did that.
- And for women.
- Ay.
- That he did not.
- Ay, that he did.
And he said they were devils incarnate.
He said once the devil would have him about women.
He did in some sort, indeed, handle women, but then he was rheumatic.
He spoke of the Whore of Babylon.
Do you not remember, he saw a flea stand on Bardolph's nose and said it was a black soul burning in hell-fire?
Well, the fuel is gone that maintained that fire.
That's all the riches I got in his service.
Shall we go? The King will be gone from Southampton.
Come, let us away.
My love, give me thy lips.
Look to my chattels and my movables.
Go, clear thy crystals.
Yoke-fellows in arms, let us to France.
Like horse-leeches my boys, to suck, to suck, the very blood to suck.
Touch her soft lips, and part.
Farewell, hostess.
I cannot kiss, that's the humour of it, but... adieu.
Let housewifery appear.
Keep close, I thee command.
Farewell, farewell, divine Zenocrate.
Is it not passing brave to be a king and ride in triumph through Persepolis?
Thus, with imagined wing, our scene flies swift as that of thought.
Suppose that you have seen the well-appointed King at Hampton Pier embark his royalty and his brave fleet.
Play on your fancies, and in them behold upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing.
Hear the shrill whistle, which doth order give to sounds confused.
Behold the threaden sails, borne with the invisible and creeping wind, draw the huge vessels through the furrowed seas, breasting the lofty surge.
O do but think you stand upon the shore, and then behold a city on the inconstant billows dancing, holding due course to Harfleur.
Follow, follow, and leave your England, as dead midnight still, guarded with grandsires, babies and old women.
For who is he, whose chin is but enriched with one appearing hair, that will not follow these culled and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?
The French, advised by good intelligence of this most dreadful preparation, shake in their fear, and with pale policy, seek to divert the English purposes.
Thus comes the English with full power upon us.
And more than carefully it us concerns to answer royally in our defences.
Therefore you Dukes of Berri... and of Bourbon,
Lord Constable and Orléans, shall make forth.
And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch to line and new-repair our towns of war with men of... courage and with means... defendant.
My most redoubted father, it is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe, and let us do it with no show of fear, no, with no more than if we heard that England were busied with a Whitsun morris dance.
For, my good liege, she is so idly kinged, so guided by a shallow, humorous youth, that fear attends her not.
O peace, Prince Dauphin.
You are too much mistaken in this king.
Question, your grace, our late ambassadors with what great state he heard their embassy, how well supplied with aged counsellors, how terrible in constant resolution.
Well, 'tis not so, my Lord High Constable.
But though we think it so, it is no matter.
In cases of defence, 'tis best to weigh the enemy more mighty than he seems.
And he is bred out of that bloody strain that haunted us in our familiar paths, when Crécy battle fatally was struck, and all our princes captive by the hand of that black name,
Edward, Black Prince of Wales.
This is a stem of that victorious stock, and let us fear the native mightiness... and fate of him.
Ambassadors from Harry,
King of England, do crave admittance to Your Majesty.
We'll give them present audience.
Go and bring them.
Good my sovereign, take up the English short, and let them know of what a monarchy you are the head.
Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin as self-neglecting.
From our brother England?
From him, and thus he greets Your Majesty.
He wills you, in the name of God Almighty, that you divest yourself and lay apart the borrowed glories that by gift of heaven, by law of nature and of nations,
'longs to him and to his heirs, namely the crown.
Willing you over-look this pedigree, and when you find him evenly derived from his most famed of famous ancestors,
Edward the Third, he bids you then resign your crown and kingdom, indirectly held from him, the native and true challenger.
If not, what follows?
Bloody constraint.
For if you hide the crown even in your hearts, there will he rake for it.
Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming, in thunder and in earthquake like a Jove, that if requiring fail, he will compel.
This is his claim, his threatening, and my message... unless the Dauphin be in presence here, to whom expressly I bring greeting too.
For us, we will consider of this further.
Tomorrow shall you bear our full intent back to our brother England.
For the Dauphin, I stand here for him.
What to him from England?
Scorn and defiance, slight regard, contempt, and anything that may not misbecome the mighty sender, doth he prize you at.
Thus says my King.
And if your father's highness do not, in grant of all demands at large, sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty, he'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it.
Tomorrow shall you know our... mind at full.
Dispatch us with all speed, lest that our king come here himself to question our delay.
Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege!
Behold the ordnance on their carriages, with fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.
Once more... unto the breach, dear friends, once more, or close the wall up with our English dead.
In peace there's nothing so becomes a man as modest stillness and humility.
But when the blast of war blows in our ears, then imitate the action of the tiger.
Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood, disguise fair nature with hard-favoured rage.
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect, let it pry through the portage of the head like a brass cannon.
Let the brow o'erwhelm it as fearfully as doth a galled rock o'er hang and jutty his confounded base, swilled with the wild and wasteful ocean.
Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide, hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit to his full height.
On, on, you noblest English, whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof, fathers that like so many Alexanders have in these parts from morn till even fought, and sheathed their swords for lack of argument.
Dishonour not your mothers.
Now attest that those whom you call fathers did beget you.
Be copy now to men of grosser blood and teach them how to war.
And you, good yeomen, whose limbs were made in England, show us here the mettle of your pasture.
Let us swear that you are worth your breeding, which I doubt not, for there is none of you so mean and base that hath not noble lustre in your eyes.
I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips, straining upon the start.
The game's afoot. Follow your spirit, and upon this charge cry, "God for Harry,
England and Saint George!"
God for Harry,
England and Saint George!
God for Harry, England and Saint George!
On, on! To the breach! To the...
Pray thee corporal, stay.
The knocks are too hot.
Ah, knocks, they come and go,
God's vassals drop and die, and sword and shield, in bloody field, both win immortal fame.
'Tis honour, and that's the truth of it.
Would I were in an alehouse in London.
I'd give all my fame for a pot of ale, and safety.
God's plud! Up to the breach, you dogs!
Avaunt, you cullions!
Ah!
Ah! Be merciful, great duke, to men of mould.
Ah! Abate thy rage, abate thy manly rage!
The nimble gunner with linstock now the devilish cannon touches.
And down goes all before it!
Captain Fluellen!
Captain Fluellen, you must come presently to the mines.
The Duke of Gloucester would speak with you.
To the mines?
Tell you the duke it is not so good to come to the mines.
For look you, the mines is not according to the disciplines of war.
The concavities of it is not sufficient.
For look you, the adversary, you may discuss unto the duke, look you, is digt himself four yards under the countermines.
I think he will blow up all if there is not better directions.
The Duke of Gloucester, to whom the order of the siege is given, is altogether directed by an Irishman, a very valiant gentleman, i'faith.
- Mm. It is Captain Macmorris, is it not?
- I think it be.
By Cheshu, he is an ass, as in the world.
I will verify as much in his beard.
He has no more directions in the true disciplines of the wars, look you, of the Roman disciplines, than is a puppy dog.
- Here he comes.
- Bah!
And the Scots captain, Captain Jamy, with him.
Ah! Captain Jamy is a marvellous, valorous gentleman, that is certain, of great expedition and knowledge in the ancient wars.
I say good day, Captain Fluellen.
Good e'en to your worship, good Captain James.
Good day. Put it there.
Captain Jamy is a marvellous, valorous gentleman, that is certain.
How now, Captain Macmorris, have you quit the mines?
Have the pioneers given o'er?
O, by the saints,
'tis ill done.
The work is give over, the trumpet sound the retreat.
By my hand, I swear, and by my father's soul, 'tis ill done.
The work is give over.
I would have blowed up the town, so God save me, in an hour.
Ah, 'tis ill done.
By my hand, 'tis ill done.
Captain Macmorris, I beseech you now, will you vouchsafe me, look you, a few disputations with you?
Partly to satisfy my opinion and partly for the satisfaction, look you, of my mind.
As touching the direction of the military disciplines, that is the point.
It shall be very good, good faith, good captains both.
And I would fain hear some discourse between you twain.
This is no time to discourse, so God save me.
No, the day is hot, and the weather and the wars and the King and the dukes.
This is no time to discourse.
The town is beseeched.
Ay, the trumpet call us into the breach and we talk and, by the Holy, do nothing!
'Tis a shame for us all, so God save me.
'Tis a shame to stand still.
'Tis a shame by my hand.
And there is throats to be cut, and work to be done, and nothing is done, save me, God.
By the mess, ere these eyes o' mine take themselves to slumber,
I'll do good service, or I'll lie i' the ground for it, ay, or go to death.
And I'll pay it as valorously as I may.
That shall I surely do.
That is the brief and the long of it.
Mm?
Captain Macmorris, I think, look you, under your correction, there is not many... of your nation.
Of my nation?
What is my nation?
Is a villain and bastard and a knave and a rascal?
What is my nation?
Who talks of my nation?
Look you, if you take the matter otherwise than is meant, Captain Macmorris, peradventure I shall think you do not use me with that affability as in discretion you ought to use me, look you, being as good a man as yourself, both in the discipline of war and in the derivation of my birth, and other particularities.
I do not know you as good a man as myself, so God save me, and I will cut off your head!
Gentlemen both, you will mistake each other.
That's a foul fault.
- The town sounds a parley!
- Hooray!
How yet resolves the governor of the town?
This is the latest parley we'll admit.
Our expectation hath this day an end.
The Dauphin, of whom succour we entreated, returns us word his powers are not yet ready to raise so great a siege.
Therefore, dread King, we yield our town and lives to your soft mercy.
Enter our gates, dispose of us and ours, for we no longer are defensible.
Open your gates.
Come, brother Gloucester.
Go you and enter Harfleur.
There remain and fortify it strongly against the French.
Use mercy to them all.
For us, dear brother, the winter coming on and sickness growing upon our soldiers, we will retire to Calais.
Tonight in Harfleur will we be your guest.
Tomorrow for the march are we addressed.
Alice, tu as été en Angleterre, et tu parles bien le langage.
Ooh, un peu, madame.
Je te prie, m'enseignez.
Il faut que j'apprenne à parler.
Comment appelez-vous "la main" en anglais?
La main? Elle est appelée "ze hand".
De hand. Et "les doigts"?
Les doigts? Ma foi, j'oublie les doigts, mais je me souviendrai.
Les doigts. Ah, je pense qu'ils sont appelés "ze fingres".
Oui. Ze fingeurs.
La main, de hand. Les doigts, de fingers.
Je pense que je suis la bonne écolier.
Je gagne deux mots d'anglais vitement.
- Comment appelez-vous "les ongles"?
- Les ongles.
Nous les appelons "the nails".
De nails. Écoutez.
Dites-moi si je parle bien.
De hand. De fingers. De nails.
Ah, c'est bien dit, madame.
Il est fort bon anglais.
- Dites-moi I'anglais pour "le bras".
- "Ze arm", madame.
- Et "le coude"?
- "The elbow".
De elbow.
Je m'en fais la répétition de tous les mots que vous m'avez appris dès à présent.
Ça c'est trop difficile, madame, comme je pense.
Excusez-moi, Alice. Écoutez. De hand, de fingers, de nails, de arm, de bilbow.
Sauf votre honneur, de "elbow".
O Seigneur Dieu, je m'en oublie.
De elbow.
- Comment appelez-vous "le col"?
- "The nick".
De nick. Et "le menton"?
- "The chin".
- De sin.
Le col, de nick. Le menton, de sin.
Sauf votre honneur, en vérité vous prononcez les mots aussi droit que les natifs d'Angleterre.
Je ne doute point d'apprendre, par la grâce de Dieu, et un peu de temps.
N'avez-vous pas déjà oublié ce que je vous ai enseigné?
Non. Je réciterai à vous promptement.
- De hand, de fingers, de mails...
- The nails, madame.
De nails. De arm. De bilbows.
- Sauf votre honneur, de elbow.
- Ainsi dis-je. De elbow.
De nick et de sin.
Comment appelez-vous
"le pied" et "la robe"?
"The foot" et "cown".
O Seigneur Dieu! Ils sont les most de son mauvais, corruptible, gros, et impudique, et non pour les dames d'honneur d'user.
Je ne voudrais prononcer ces mots devant les seigneurs de France pour tout le monde.
Foh! De foot et de cown.
Néanmoins, je réciterai encore une fois ma leÇon ensemble.
De hand, de fingers, de nails, de arm, de elbow, de nick, de sin, de foot et de cown.
Ooh, madame, c'est excellent!
C'est assez pour une fois.
Allons-nous à dîner.
'Tis certain he hath passed the River Somme.
And if he be not fought withal, my lord, let us not live in France.
Let us quit all and give our vineyards to a barbarous people.
Normans, but dastard Normans.
Norman bastards.
Mort de ma vie.
If they march along unfought withal, then I will sell my dukedom to buy a slobbery and dirty farm in that nook-shotten isle of Albion.
Dieu de batailles!
Where have they this mettle?
Is not the climate foggy, raw and dull on whom as in despite the sun looks pale, killing their fruit with frowns?
And shall our quick blood, spirited with wine, seem frosty?
By faith and honour, our madams mock at us and plainly say our mettle is bred out and they will give their bodies to the lust of English youth, to new-store France with bastard warriors.
Where is Mountjoy the herald?
Speed him hence.
Let him greet England with our sharp defiance.
Up, princes, and with spirit of honour edged bar Harry England, that sweeps through our land with pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur.
Go down upon him, you have power enough, and in a captive chariot into Rouen bring him our prisoner.
This becomes the great.
Sorry am I his numbers are so few, his soldiers sick and famished in their march.
For I am sure when he shall see our army he'll drop his heart into the sink of fear and, for achievement, offer us his ransom.
Therefore, Lord Constable, haste on Mountjoy.
Prince Dauphin, you shall stay with us in Rouen.
- Not so, I do beseech Your Majesty.
- Be patient, for you shall remain with us.
Now forth, Lord Constable, and princes all, and quickly bring us word of England's fall.
You know me by my habit.
Well then, I know thee.
What shall I know of thee?
- My master's mind.
- Unfold it.
Thus says my king,
"Say thou to Harry of England,
"though we seemed dead, we did but slumber.
"Tell him we could have rebuked him at Harfleur,
"but we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full ripe.
"Now we speak upon our cue, and our voice is imperial.
"England shall repent his folly, see his weakness,
"and admire our sufferance.
"Bid him therefore consider of his ransom,
"which must proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we have lost,
"the disgrace we have digested.
"For our losses, his exchequer is too poor.
"For the effusion of our blood,
"the muster of his kingdom too faint a number.
"And for our disgrace, his own person kneeling at our feet
"but a weak and worthless satisfaction.
"To this add defiance, and tell him for conclusion
"he hath betrayed his followers, whose condemnation is pronounced. "
So far my King and master, so much my office.
- What is thy name? I know thy quality.
- Mountjoy.
Thou dost thy office fairly.
Turn thee back and tell thy king I do not seek him now, but could be willing to march on to Calais without impeachment.
For to say the sooth, my people are with sickness much enfeebled, my numbers lessened.
Go, therefore, tell thy master here I am.
My ransom is this frail and worthless body, my army but a weak and sickly guard.
Yet, God before, tell him we will come on, though France herself and such another neighbour is stood in our way.
If we may pass, we will.
If we be hindered, we shall your tawny ground with your red blood discolour.
And so, Mountjoy, fare you well.
We would not seek a battle as we are, nor as we are we say we will not shun it.
So tell your master.
I shall deliver so.
- There's for thy labour, Mountjoy.
- Thanks to Your Highness.
- March to the bridge.
- The bridge!
It now draws toward night.
Beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves.
And on the morrow bid them march away.
Now entertain conjecture of a time when creeping murmur and the poring dark fills the wide vessel of the universe.
From camp to camp, through the foul womb of night, the hum of either army stilly sounds, that the fixed sentinels almost receive the secret whispers of each other's watch.
Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames each battle sees the other's umbered face.
Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs piercing the night's dull ear.
And from the tents the armourers, accomplishing the knights, with busy hammers closing rivets up, give dreadful note of preparation.
Proud of their numbers and secure in soul, the confident and over-lusty French do the low-rated English play at dice, and chide the cripple tardy-gaited night, who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp so tediously away.
Tut, I have the best armour of the world.
Would it were day.
You have an excellent armour, but let my horse have his due.
It is the best horse of Europe.
Hm.
Will it never be morning?
My Lord of Orléans, my Lord High Constable, you talk of horse and armour?
You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world.
What a long night is this.
I will not change my horse for any that treads on four hooves.
Ah ha! He bounds from the earth.
When I bestride him, I soar, I am a hawk.
He trots the air, the earth sings when he touches it.
He is of the colour of nutmeg and of the heat of the ginger.
He is pure air and fire, and all other jades you may call beasts.
It is indeed, my lord, a most absolute and excellent... horse.
It is the prince of palfreys.
His neigh is like the bidding of a monarch
- and his countenance enforces homage.
- No more, cousin.
Nay, cousin, the man hath no wit that cannot from the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb vary deserved praise on my palfrey.
I once writ a sonnet in his praise, and began thus -
"Wonder of nature... "
Ahem. I have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress.
Then did they imitate that which I composed to my courser, for my horse is my mistress.
Methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly shook your back.
My Lord Constable, the armour that I see in your tent tonight, are those stars or suns upon it?
- Stars, my lord.
- Some of them will fall tomorrow, I hope.
That may be.
Will it never be day?
I will trot tomorrow a mile and my way shall be paved with English faces.
Who will go hazard with me for 20 prisoners?
'Tis midnight.
I'll go arm myself.
The Dauphin longs for morning.
Hm.
He longs to eat the English.
I think he will eat all he kills.
Ho-ho, he never did harm that I heard of.
Nor will do none tomorrow.
He'll keep that good name still.
I know him to be valiant.
I was told that by one that knows him better than you.
- What's he?
- Marry, he told me so himself.
And he said he cared not who knew it.
My Lord High Constable, the English lie within 1500 paces of your tents.
Who hath measured the ground?
The Lord Grandpré.
A valiant and most expert gentleman.
Would it were day.
Alas, poor Harry of England.
He longs not for the dawning as we do.
Huh. What a wretched and peevish fellow is this King of England, to mope with his fat-brained followers so far out of his knowledge.
If the English had any apprehension, they would run away.
That they lack, for if their heads had any intellectual armour they could never wear such heavy headpieces.
That island of England breeds very valiant creatures.
Their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage.
Foolish curs, that run winking into the mouth of a Russian bear and have their heads crushed like rotten apples.
You may as well say,
"That's a valiant flea
"that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion. "
Just. Just. And the men are like the mastiffs.
Give them great meals of beef and iron and steel, they'll eat like wolves and fight like devils.
But these English are shrewdly out of beef.
Hm. Then shall we find tomorrow they've only stomachs to eat and none to fight.
Hm. Now is it time to arm.
Come. Shall we about it?
It is now two o'clock.
But let me see - by ten, we shall have each a hundred Englishmen.
The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll and the third hour of drowsy morning name.
The poor, condemned English, like sacrifices, by their watchful fires sit patiently and inly ruminate the morning's danger.
And their gesture sad, investing lank, lean cheeks and war-worn coats, presenteth them unto the gazing moon so many horrid ghosts.
O now, who will behold the royal captain of this ruined band walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent, let him cry, "Praise and glory on his head. "
For forth he goes and visits all his host, bids them good morrow with a modest smile and calls them brothers, friends and countrymen.
A largesse universal, like the sun, his liberal eye doth give to everyone, thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all behold, as may unworthiness define, a little touch of Harry in the night.
Gloucester, 'tis true that we are in great danger.
The greater therefore should our courage be.
Good morrow, old Sir Thomas Erpingham.
A good, soft pillow for that good, white head were better than a churlish turf of France.
Not so, my liege.
This lodging suits me better, since I may say, "Now lie I like a king. "
Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas.
I and my bosom must debate awhile, and then I would no other company.
The Lord in heaven bless thee, noble Harry.
God-a-mercy, old heart.
Qui va là?
A friend.
Discuss unto me - art thou officer?
Or art thou base, common and popular?
I am a gentleman of a company.
Trail'st thou the puissant pike?
- Even so. What are you?
- As good a gentleman as the emperor.
- Then you are better than the King.
- Ah.
The King's a bawcock and a heart-of-gold, a lad of life, an imp of fame, of parents good, of fist most valiant.
I kiss his dirty shoe, and from heartstring
I love the lovely bully.
- What is thy name?
- Henry le roi.
Leroi? A Cornish name.
Art thou of Cornish crew?
No, I'm a Welshman.
- Know'st thou Fluellen?
- Yes.
- Art thou his friend?
- Ay, and his kinsman, too.
Well, tell him I'll knock his leek about his head upon Saint Davy's day.
Do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day, lest he knock that about yours.
- A figo for thee, then.
- I thank you. God be with you.
My name is Pistol called.
It sorts well with your fierceness.
Captain Fluellen?
- Captain Fluellen?
- Shh! Shh!
In the name of Beelzebub, speak lower.
If you will take the pains but to examine the wars of Pompey the Great, you shall find, I warrant you, there is no tittle-tattle nor pibble-pabble in Pompey's camp.
I warrant you shall find the ceremonies of the wars, and the cares of it, and the forms of it, to be otherwise.
Why, the enemy is loud.
You can hear him all night.
If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb, is it meet, think you, that we should also, look you, be an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb?
- Shh.
- In your own conscience now?
I will speak lower.
I pray you and beseech you that you will.
Though it appear a little out of fashion, there is much care and valour in this Welshman.
Brother John Bates, be not that the morning which breaks yonder?
I think it be. But we have no great cause to desire the approach of day.
We see yonder the beginning of the day, but I think we shall never see the end of it.
Who goes there?
A friend.
Under what captain serve you?
Under... Sir Thomas Erpingham.
Oh. A good old commander and a most kind gentleman.
I pray you, what thinks he of our estate?
Even as men wrecked upon a sand, that look to be washed off the next tide.
He hath not told his thought to the King?
No. Nor it is not meet he should.
For I think the King is but a man, as I am.
The violet smells to him as it doth to me.
His ceremonies laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man.
Therefore, when he sees reasons of fears, as we do, his fears, without doubt, be of the same relish as ours are.
Yet no man should find in him any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing it, should dishearten his army.
He may show what outward courage he will, but I believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he'd wish himself in Thames up to the neck.
So I would he were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.
By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the King.
I think he would not wish himself anywhere... but where he is.
Then I would he were here alone.
So should he be sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's lives saved.
Methinks... I would not die anywhere so contented as in the King's company, his cause being just and his quarrel honourable.
It's more than we know.
Ay.
Or more than we should seek after.
For we know enough if we know we are the King's subjects.
If his cause be wrong, our obedience to the King wipes the crime of it out of us.
But if the cause be not good, the King himself hath a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and arms and heads... chopped off in a battle shall join together at the latter day, and cry all, "We died at such a place," some swearing, some crying for a surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their children rawly left.
I'm afraid there are few die well that die in a battle, for how can they charitably dispose of anything, when blood is their argument?
Now, if these men do not die well, it'll be a black matter for the King that led them to it.
Ay.
So, if a son that is by his father sent upon merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the imputation of his wickedness, by your rule, should be imposed upon his father, that sent him.
But this is not so.
The King is not bound to answer for the particular endings of his soldiers, nor the father of his son, for they purpose not their deaths when they purpose their services.
Every subject's duty is the King's, but every subject's soul is his own.
'Tis certain. Every man that dies ill, the ill's on his own head.
The King's not to answer for it.
I do not desire he should answer for me, and yet I determine to fight lustily for him.
I myself heard the King say he would not be ransomed.
He said so to make us fight cheerfully, for when our throats are cut, he may be ransomed and we ne'er the wiser.
If ever I live to see it,
I'll never trust his word after.
That's a perilous shot out of a pop-gun, that a poor and private displeasure can do against a monarch.
You may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in its face with a peacock's feather.
You'll never trust his word after.
- Come, 'tis a foolish saying.
- Your reproof is something too round.
I should be angry with you if the time were convenient.
Let it be a quarrel between us, then, if you live.
Be friends, you English fools.
We have French quarrels enough if you could tell how to reckon.
Never trust in his word, I say.
Upon the King.
Let us our lives, our souls, our debts, our careful wives, our children... and our sins lay on the King.
We must bear all.
What infinite heartsease must kings forego that private men enjoy?
And what have kings that privates have not too, save ceremony?
And what art thou, thou idol ceremony, that sufferest more of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers?
What drink'st thou oft, instead of homage sweet, but poisoned flattery?
O be sick, great greatness, and bid thy ceremony give thee cure.
Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggar's knee, command the health of it?
No, thou proud dream that play'st so subtly with a king's repose.
I am a king that find thee, and I know 'tis not the orb and sceptre, crown imperial, the throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp that beats upon the high shore of this world.
Not all these, laid in bed majestical, can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave who, with a body filled and vacant mind, gets him to rest, crammed with distressful bread.
Never sees horrid night, the child of hell, but like a lackey from the rise to set sweats in the eye of Phoebus, and all night sleeps in Elysium.
Next day, after dawn doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse, and follows so the ever-running year with profitable labour to his grave.
And but for ceremony, such a wretch, winding up days with toil and nights with sleep, had the forehand and vantage of a king.
My lord, your nobles, jealous of your absence, seek through your camp to find you.
Good old knight.
# Amen #
Collect them all together at my tent.
I'll be before thee.
O God of battles, steel my soldiers' hearts.
Possess them not with fear.
Take from them now the sense of reckoning, lest the opposed numbers pluck their hearts from them.
My Lord.
My Lord, the army stays upon your presence.
I know thy errand.
I will go with thee.
The day, my friends, and all things... stay for me.
The sun doth gild our armour!
Up, my lords!
Montez à cheval.
Ah, my horse. Varlet, lacquais.
- O, brave spirit!
- Via les eaux et la terre!
- We have wind! L'air et le feu!
- Ciel, cousin Orléans.
Hark how our steeds for present service neigh.
Mount them and make incision in their hides that their hot blood may spin in English eyes and quench them with superior courage.
The English are embattled, you French peers.
A very little little let us do and all is done.
Then let the trumpets sound the tucket sonance and the note to mount.
Come, come away.
The sun is high and we outwear the day.
Where is the King?
The King himself is rode to view their battle.
Of fighting men they have full threescore thousand.
There's five to one.
Besides, they all are fresh.
God's arm strike with us.
'Tis a fearful odds.
Well, God with you, princes all.
I'll to my charge.
If we no more meet till we meet in heaven, then joyfully, my noble Westmoreland, my dear Lord Gloucester, my good Lord Exeter and my kind kinsmen, warriors all, adieu.
Farewell, good Salisbury, and good luck go with thee.
Farewell, kind lord.
O that we now had here but one ten thousand of those men in England that do not work today.
What's he that wishes so?
My cousin Westmoreland?
No, my fair cousin.
If we are marked to die, we are enough to do our country loss, and if to live, the fewer men, the greater share of honour.
God's will, I pray thee wish not one man more.
Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host that he which hath no stomach to this feast, let him depart.
His passport shall be drawn and crowns for convoy put into his purse.
We would not die in that man's company that fears his fellowship to die with us.
This day is called the Feast of Crispian.
He that outlives this day and comes safe home will stand a-tiptoe when this day is named and rouse him at the name of Crispian.
He that shall live this day and see old age will yearly, on the vigil, feast his neighbours and say,
"Tomorrow is Saint Crispian. "
Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars and say,
"These wounds I had on Crispin's Day. "
Old men forget.
Yet all shall be forgot, but he'll remember, with advantages, what feats he did that day.
Then shall our names, familiar in his mouth as household words -
Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter,
Warwick and Talbot,
Salisbury and Gloucester - be in their flowing cups freshly remembered.
This story shall the good man teach his son, and Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by from this day to the ending of the world but we in it shall be remembered.
We few, we happy few, we band of brothers.
For he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother, be he ne'er so base.
And gentlemen in England now abed shall think themselves accursed they were not here, and hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks that fought with us upon Saint Crispin's Day!
My lord, bestow yourself with speed.
The French are bravely in their battles set and will with all expedience charge on us.
All things are ready if our minds be so.
Perish the man whose mind is backward now.
Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?
God's will, my liege, would you and I alone could fight this battle out.
You know your places.
God be with you all!
Once more I come to know thee,
King Harry.
If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound before thy most assured overthrow.
- Who hath sent thee now?
- The Constable of France.
I pray thee bear my former answer back.
Bid them achieve me, and then sell my bones.
Good God, why should they mock poor fellows thus?
The man that once did sell the lion's skin while the beast lived, was killed with hunting him.
A many of our bodies shall no doubt find native graves, upon the which, I trust, shall witness live in brass of this day's work.
And those that leave their valiant bones in France, dying like men, though buried in your dunghills they shall be famed.
For there the sun shall greet them and draw their honours reeking up to heaven, leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime, the smell whereof shall breed a plague in France.
Let me speak proudly.
Tell the Constable we are but warriors for the working day.
Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirched with rainy marching in the painful field.
And time hath worn us into slovenry.
But by the mass, our hearts are in the trim.
Hooray!
Come now no more for ransom, gentle herald.
They shall have none, I swear, but these my bones, which if they have as I will leave 'em them, shall yield them little. Tell the Constable.
I shall, King Harry. And so fare thee well.
Thou never shalt hear herald any more.
Now, soldiers, march away.
And how thou pleasest, God, dispose the day.
Well have we done, thrice-valiant countrymen!
But all's not done - yet keep the French the field.
O everlasting shame!
Let's stab ourselves.
Be these the wretches that we played at dice for?
Is this the king we sent to for his ransom?
Shame on thee, Colonel, shame.
Nothing but shame. Let's die in honour.
- Once more back again.
- We are enough yet living in the field to smother up the English if any order might be thought upon.
The devil take order now.
I'll to the throng.
Let life be short, else shame will be too long.
Odd's blood.
Kill the boys and the luggage!
'Tis expressly against the law of arms!
'Tis as arrant a piece of knavery, mark you now, as can be offered.
In your conscience now, is it not?
'Tis certain there's not a boy left alive.
The cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha' done this slaughter.
Here comes His Majesty.
I was not angry since I came to France... until this instant.
Take a trumpet, herald. Ride thou unto the horsemen on yonder hill.
If they won't fight with us, bid them come down, or void the field.
They do offend our sight!
Here comes the herald of the French, my liege.
His eyes are humbler than they used to be.
God's will.
What means this, herald?
Comest thou again for ransom?
No, great King. I come to thee for charitable licence, that we may wander o'er this bloody field to book our dead and then to bury them.
The day is yours.
Praised be God, and not our strength, for it.
What is this castle called that stands hard by?
We call it Agincourt.
Then... call we this the field of Agincourt, fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.
# Our King went forth to Normandy
# With grace and might of chivalry
# There God for him wrought marvellously
# Wherefore England... #
Here is the number of the slaughtered French.
This note doth tell me of ten thousand
French that in the field lie slain.
Where is the number of our English dead?
Edward, the Duke of York.
The Earl of Suffolk.
Sir Richard Ketly.
Davy Gam Esquire.
And of all other men... but five-and-twenty score.
O God, thy arm was here.
- 'Tis wonderful.
- Come.
Go we in procession to the village.
Let there be sung
Non Nobis and Te Deum,
- the dead with charity enclosed in clay.
- # Non nobis dominum... #
And then to Calais!
And to England then, where ne'er from France arrived more happier men.
# Tuo da Gloriam
# Non nobis, Domine
# Sed nomine, tuo da Gloriam
# Te Deum laudamus
# Te Dominum confitemur
# Te aeternum Patrem
# Omnis terra veneratur #
Nay, that's right.
But why wear you your leek today?
Saint Davy's day is past.
There is occasions and causes why and wherefore in all things, Captain Gower.
I will tell you, as my friend,
Captain Gower.
The rascally, beggarly, lousy knave, Pistol, which you and yourself and all the world know to be no better than a fellow, look you, of no merits - he is come to me and bring me bread and salt yesterday, look you, and bid me eat my leek.
It was in a place where I could not breed no contention with him, but I will be so bold as wear it in my cap till I see him once again.
And then I will tell him a little piece of my desires.
Why, 'tis a gull, a fool, a rogue, that now and then goes to the wars to grace himself at his returning to London under the form of a soldier.
And what such as the camp can do among foaming bottles and ale-washed wits is wonderful to be thought of.
Here he comes, swelling like a turkey-cock.
'Tis no matter for his swellings, nor his turkey-cocks.
God bless you, Pistol, you scurvy, lousy knave.
- God bless you.
- Hah! Art thou bedlam?
Hence! I am qualmish at the smell of leek.
I beseech you heartily, scurvy, lousy knave, to eat, look you, this leek.
Eugh. Not for Cadwallader and all his goats.
There is one goat for you.
Will you be so good as eat it?
Base Trojan! Thou shalt die.
You say very true when God's will is.
I will desire you to live in the meantime, and eat your victuals.
Come, there is sauce for it.
If you can mock a leek, you can eat a leek.
- Bite, I pray you.
- Must I bite?
Out of doubt and out of question, too.
By this leek,
I will most horribly revenge...
I eat. I eat...
- I swear...
- Nay, pray you, throw none away.
The skin is good for your broken coxcomb.
When you take occasions to see leeks hereafter,
I pray you mock at 'em, that is all.
- Good.
- Ay, leeks is good.
Hold you, here is a penny to heal your head.
- Me, a penny?
- Yes, verily.
In truth you shall take it or I have another leek in my pocket which you shall eat.
God b'wi' you and keep you and... heal your head.
Brrrrr!
All hell shall stir for this.
Go to. You are a counterfeit, cowardly knave.
You thought, because he could not speak English in the native garb, that he therefore could not handle an
English cudgel. But you find it otherwise.
And henceforth, let a Welsh correction teach you a good English condition.
Fare ye well.
Doth fortune play the strumpet with me now?
News have I that my Nell lies dead in the hospital, of the malady of France.
And there my rendezvous is quite cut off.
Old do I wax, and from my weary limbs honour is cudgelled.
Well... bawd I'll turn, and something lean to cutpurse of quick hand.
To England will I steal, and there... I'll steal, and patches will I get unto these scars, and swear I got them in these present wars.
Peace to this meeting, wherefore we are met.
Unto our brother France and to our sister, health and fair time of day.
Joy and good wishes to our most fair and princely cousin, Katherine.
And as a branch or member of this royalty, we do salute you, Duke of Burgundy.
And princes French, and peers, health to you all.
Right joyous are we to behold your face, most worthy brother England, fairly met.
So are you, princes English, every one.
So happy be the issue, brother England, of this good day and of this gracious meeting, as we are now glad to behold your eyes - your eyes which hitherto have borne in them, against the French that met them in their bent, the fatal balls of murdering basilisks.
The venom of such looks we fairly hope have lost their quality, and that this day shall change all griefs and quarrels... into love.
To cry amen to that, thus we appear.
My duty to you both, on equal love, great Kings of France and England.
Since that my office hath so far prevailed that face to face and royal eye to eye you have assembled, let it not disgrace me if I demand, before this royal view, why that the naked, poor and mangled peace, dear nurse of arts, of plenties, and ofjoyful births, should not in this best garden of the world, our fertile France, put up her lovely visage.
Alas, she hath from France too long been chased, and all her husbandry doth lie on heaps, corrupting in its own fertility.
Her vine, the merry cheerer of the heart, unpruned, dies.
Her hedges even-pleached, put forth disordered twigs.
Her fallow leas, the darnel, hemlock and rank fumitory, doth root upon, while that the coulter rusts that should deracinate such savagery.
The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth the freckled cowslip, burnet and green clover, wanting the scythe, all uncorrected, rank, conceives by idleness, and nothing teems but hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burs, losing both beauty and utility.
Even so our houses and ourselves and children have lost, or do not learn for want of time, the sciences that should become our country, but grow like savages - as soldiers will that nothing do but meditate on blood - to swearing and stern looks, diffused attire, and everything that seems... unnatural.
Which to reduce into her former favour you are assembled.
Then, Duke of Burgundy, you must gain that peace with full accord to all our just demands.
I have but with a cursory eye o'erglanced the articles.
Pleaseth your grace to appoint some of your council presently to sit with us.
We will suddenly pass our accept and peremptory answer.
Brother, we shall.
Will you, fair sister, go with the princes... or stay here with us?
Our gracious brother, I will go with them.
Haply, a woman's voice may do some good when articles too nicely urged be stood on.
Yet leave our cousin Katherine here with us.
She hath good leave.
Fair Katherine, and most fair... will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms such as will enter at a lady's ear and plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
Your Majesty shall mock at me.
I cannot speak your England.
O fair Katherine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart,
I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue.
Do you... like me, Kate?
Pardonnez-moi?
I cannot tell what is... "like me".
An angel is like you, Kate.
And you are like an angel.
Que dit-il?
Que je suis semblable à les anges?
Oui, vraiment, sauf votre grâce, ainsi dit-il.
O bon Dieu. Les langues des hommes sont pleines de tromperies.
What says she, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Oui, that the tongues of de mens is be full of deceits.
I' faith, Kate, I am glad thou can speak no better English.
For if thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think that I had sold my farm to buy my crown.
I know no ways to mince it in love, but directly to say... "I love you. "
Give me your answer, i' faith do, and so clap hands and a bargain.
How say you, lady?
Sauf votre honneur, me understand well.
Marry, if you put me to verses, or to dance for your sake, Kate, why, you undo me.
If I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse for her favours,
I could lay on like a butcher, and sit like a jackanapes, never off.
But before God, Kate, I cannot look greenly, nor gasp out my eloquence, nor have I no cunning in protestation.
If thou canst love a fellow of this temper, Kate, that never looks in his glass for the love of anything he sees there, whose face is not worth sunburning... take me.
If not, to say to thee that I shall die is true.
But, for thy love, by the Lord, no.
Yet I love thee, too.
And while thou livest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain constancy, for these fellows of infinite tongue that can rhyme themselves into ladies' favours, they do always reason themselves out again.
A speaker is but a prater, a rhyme is but a ballad.
A straight back will stoop, a black beard will turn white, a fair face will wither, a full eye will wax hollow, but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon.
If thou wouldst have such a one, take me.
And take me, take a soldier.
Take a soldier, take a king.
And what sayest thou then to my love?
Speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.
Is it possible dat I should love de enemy of France?
No, Kate, but in loving me you would love the friend of France, for I love France so well that I will not part with a village of it.
And Kate, when France is mine, and I am yours, then yours is France, and you are mine.
I... cannot tell what is dat.
No, Kate? I will tell thee in French, which I am sure will hang upon my tongue like a newly married wife about her husband's neck, hardly to be shook off.
Er... Je... quand sur le possession de France, et quand vous avez le possession de moi...
Er... donc vôtre est France et vous êtes mienne.
I shall never move thee in French unless it be to laugh at me.
Sauf votre honneur, le français que vous parlez, il est meilleur que I'anglais que je parle.
No, i' faith, it's not, Kate.
Thy speaking of my tongue and thy thine must needs be granted to be much alike.
But, Kate, dost thou understand thus much English?
Canst thou... love me?
I cannot tell.
Can any of your neighbours tell, Kate?
I'll ask them.
Come, I know thou lovest me.
And at night, when you are come into your chamber, you will question this gentlewoman about me, and I know, Kate, you will to her dispraise those parts in me which you love with your heart.
But, good Kate, mock me mercifully - the rather, gentle princess, because I love thee... cruelly.
What sayest thou, my fair flower-de-luce?
La plus belle Katherine du monde, mon très chère et divine déesse.
Your majesté 'ave a false French enough to deceive de most sage demoiselle dat is en France.
Now fie upon my false French but, by mine honour, in true English,
I love thee, Kate.
By which honour, though I dare not swear thou lovest me yet my blood begins to flatter me thou dost.
Put off your maiden blushes.
Avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress.
Take me by the hand and say,
"Harry of England, I am thine" - which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal, but I will tell thee aloud,
"England is thine, Ireland is thine,
France is thine
"and Henry Plantagenet is thine. "
Therefore, queen of all, Katherine, break thy mind to me in broken English - wilt thou have me?
Dat is as it shall please de roi mon père.
Nay, it shall please him well, Kate.
It shall please him, Kate.
Den it shall also content me.
Upon that I kiss your hand and call you my queen.
Laissez, mon seigneur, laissez, laissez!
Ma foi, je ne peut vous abbaissez votre grandeur en baisant la main d'une de votre indigne serviteur.
Excusez-moi, je vous supplie, mon treis-puissant seigneur.
Oh.
- Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.
- Oh!
Les dames et demoiselles pour être baisées devant le noces, ce n'est pas la coutume en France.
Madam my interpreter, what says she?
That it is not the fashion for the ladies of France...
Oh...
- I cannot tell what is "baiser" in English.
- To kiss.
Votre majesté entend bettre que moi.
It is not the fashion for the maids in France to kiss before they are married, would she say?
Oui, vraiment.
O Kate... nice customs courtesy to great kings.
Dear Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak list of a country's fashion.
We are the makers of manners, Kate.
Therefore, patiently... and yielding...
You have witchcraft in your lips... Kate.
God save Your Majesty.
My royal cousin, teach you our princess... English?
I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how perfectly I love her, and that is good English.
Shall Kate be my wife?
Take her, fair son, that the contending kingdoms of France and England, whose very shores look pale with envy of each other's happiness, may cease their hatred and never war advance his bleeding sword
'twixt England and fair France.
Amen.
Thus far with rough and all-unable pen our bending author hath pursued the story, in little room confining mighty men, mangling by starts the full course of their glory.
Small time, but in that small most greatly lived this star of England.
Fortune made his sword, and for his sake, in your fair minds let this acceptance take.

JOAN OF ARC
And so by disposition of the divine mercy, it was done most opportunely, that Joan, child of god, daughter of France, today be placed among the number of the saints.
Saint Joan of Arc whose history is recorded here, lived only 19 years on this earth.
She was born in 1412 in a village of Domremy, on the marche of Lorraine.
At the time when France, losing the hundred years war, was overrun by her enemies, her cities ruined, her farms stripped bare, her people hopeless.
But the enemies of France did not reckon on the girl Joan praying in the little ruined church of her village.
As she knelt there, the voices of the saint spoke to her again and again, urging her to become a soldier, to lead the armies of France to victory.
But how?
How can I?
Save France?
How can I?
Lead the Dauphin to his coronation?
I'm only a poor girl of the farms.
I've never seen a king or an army.
How?
I'm not fitted to speak to great people or among them.
All this time I have... I have tried to make a beginning but I can find no ways so nothing is done.
I know that everyday now we lose France. But I still don't how to go about what is asked of me.
So I do nothing.
Forgive me, forgive me.
I am helpless and anguish.
Will a voice come and say that
I am forgiven.
I've tried with all my soul, I've tried.
Then I must go and do what I can without knowing how.
Uncle Durand!
Uncle Durand!
Uncle Durand!
- Jeannette, did I forget something?
- No, only uncle Durand
I must go to Vaucouleurs, take me with you.
- To Vacouleurs?
- Yes.
Your father said nothing about this to me.
Your mother said nothing about it.
No.
Well this is very strange, Jeannette.
You want to buy something in the city?
I have to speak to
Sir Robert de Baudricourt.
What about? Why would you speak to the King's captain?
- I can't tell you Uncle Durand.
- Then I can't take you.
I shall walk then.
Even if I wear my legs to the knees, I must go.
It maybe that I do wrong... but come.
- Next.
- Gerard Morseau, Sir Robert.
- Morseau, you are late for the taxes.
- Uh they burn my house, Sir Robert.
- Stole my grain.
- Give him till next harvest.
Durand Laxart,
- Taxes in your village is not due yet.
- I know, Sir Robert.
- This is uh... this is my niece.
- Hm.
She is the daughter of
Jacques D'Arcde of Domrémy.
Yes, yes.
She wish to speak with you.
- I... I...
- Yes, yes, go on, go speak up. Tell me.
I... I bring you a message Sir Robert.
You must send me to the Dauphin.
My lord commands it.
Your lord? I am your lord!
- My Lord is the King of Heaven.
- Hm, that's a point. That's a point.
But I am to lead the Dauphin's armies.
To lead his armies?
When did the Dauphin have an army?
And women don't lead armies girl, they follow!
And if you want to become them, the camp follower can be arranged.
- But I'm to save France.
- To save France?
Go home girl and don't be an idiot!
If it would have been possible to save France, it would have been done long ago.
But you must send me to the Dauphin,
I must save France!
I am sorry, Sir Robert.
I didn't know what she is going to say.
I'll take her home.
What a fool you made out of me, if
I've known what you are going to say...
I didn't want to bring this on you uncle
Durand, but there was no other way.
And I had to speak to him.
You had to? Your father will never forgive me.
- Never in the world!
- Hush, hush cousin.
Make way!
Attention! Make way!
Jeannette! No, Jeannette, come back!
- Sir Robert has spoken!
- Sir Robert!
Sir Robert, you must send me out to take part in the war!
Orleans is in great danger, and even today a battle is raging.
What? Orleans is 200 leagues from here, nobody knows what's going on there.
Sir Robert!
Sir Robert!
Jeannette!
That's a very strange thing you said girl.
Yes, they are strange.
I'm sent here to speak to
Sir Robert, but you saw that he cares neither for me nor for my words.
Nevertheless before the middle of Lent
I must be with the Dauphin.
Believe me I rather go home and spin with my mother.
For this is not my proper place.
But there is not one person in the world, not among Kings, or nobles, or princes who can bring help to the France we love.
Not once save this maid you see before you.
It's not because of anything in me, but because the King of heaven wishes it so.
Have you heard of a prophecy?
There is a prophecy that a maid from Lorraine will save France.
- Have you heard it?
- No, I know nothing of a prophecy.
Why are you here again?
You know Sir Robert won't see you.
Go home girl and don't come back tomorrow.
That's she, coming now.
- Forgive me, but are you the maid?
- I'm Joan, daughter of Jacques D'Arc.
We heard about you in
Lille, we wanted to see you.
And to tell you that we believe in you, we prayed for you.
We held a mass for you last Sunday.
Thank you.
I know that your prayers will help.
The gates were locked in my face again.
Mother.
I came to take you home, Jeannette.
You must come home, Jeannette.
A dark dream has crept over you for a little while, but its done no harm, and soon it will be gone and when it's gone no one will think of it.
But come home.
I never wanted to hurt you, mother.
For I love you more than anyone else in the world.
But if I had a
100 fathers and a 100 mothers,
I could not go back.
I must go forward now.
Then tell me where, Jeannette?
Toward what would you go?
- Where's the girl?
- Sir Robert.
That's the one.
Exactly 2 weeks ago you came to see me and spoke of a battle.
Today a courier came with messages.
There was indeed a great battle on that day.
And a heavy defeat for the Dauphin.
How did you learnt this?
Have you studied witchcraft?
- Oh surely you know I have not.
- That is just what we do not know.
Father Fournier, put her to question.
If you are a thing of evil and sent from Satan, depart from us.
If you are good and from god, come near
I ask your blessing, father.
And I ask of whatever is evil fly far from you.
Whatever is good remain to help our cause in the course of France.
She is no socerer, Sir Robert.
Whatever you have heard or see, whether prophecy or not, the devil has no part in it.
Thank you, father.
- You still wish to go to the Dauphin.
- My Lord has commanded me to go.
These 2 gentlemen wish me to send you forth on this wild mission of yours, they are willing to ride with you as escort.
To me it seems like a fool's attempt, but they believe you may help our country.
Now if there is a chance of that,
I don't want to put anything in the way.
Then it shall all come true.
Goodbye, my child.
Ever since I heard you speak,
I've got a kind of dream.
But I never yet seen it clearly where I must go, or what I must do with my life.
But suddenly, when I heard your voice, it seem to me that I knew.
I come to be your follower.
Thank you.
You are the first.
And I'm quite willing to be the second.
When do we set out?
Today rather than tomorrow.
Tomorrow rather than the day after.
Joan, have you ridden before?
By the time we reach Chinon
I should ride well.
Take care that you ride only by night, the news of your coming will run ahead like fire and the enemy will want to watch for you.
I fear them not.
A mother bears children and gives them to the world and she thinks she knows them well.
But she doesn't know them at all.
And now you must go. Guard her well.
With many leagues to ride and icy rivers to cross.
Go to the shrine of redeemer, mother, and pray for us.
- Goodbye!
- God be with you!
- Godspeed, Joan, come back soon!
- Goodbye, Joan!
- God help you Joan.
- Thank you!
Go then maid of Lorraine,
I expect but little of you, but go... and come what may.
Farewell, Joan!
- Goodbye!
- Farewell, Joan!
Well, tell us who you are!
Travelers, my friend, just travelers.
- And who may you be?
- I'm the head constable of Clairevaux.
We're honest men.
You may be, but I must look at you.
Are you a lad?
- Let me tell you why we meet you here.
- Well, tell us and let us go on.
There is a party of
Burgundy soldiers in our town.
They say that they're here to lay hands on the maid from Lorraine, the one that is coming to help the Dauphin.
If one of you should be that maid,
- Then go round our village.
- Thank you, constable.
This does not concern us.
My wife send two loaves of bread.
- That was the best we could do.
- Thank you again.
I would like to if you would permit me to lay them in the hands of the lad myself.
If it should be that you're the maid from Lorraine,
I don't say that you are, but if it should be,
I have a message for you from the people of Clairevaux.
It's this:
"God go with you."
"God go with you and save
France and save us too."
Now we can go to our homes, neighbours, we've seen her and we've given her the warning.
Those are the towers of Chinon.
Oh we've come through safely.
We're here.
- Did you bring the gold Tremouille?
- Gold?
Gold? No, I did not.
You should bow when you come into the presence, Duke.
Your attitude is... slovenly.
- You owe me money.
- Money?
I have definite information that you plan to abandon your kingdom.
You're leaving us.
You're deserting us.
If I lent you 3,000 crowns, you dissapear to the North or the
South and I can whistle for my money.
Not only this loan in question but the enormous sums you already owe me.
Then lend me a thousand.
It's safer, I can't go very far on that.
I'll need your signature.
I refuse to sign until I have the money.
I'll need your signature first.
- Lacky, a quill for my Lord.
- You robber! You thief! You brigand!
Gentlemen, not before the court.
Before he lends me money he demands my signature at the bottom of a blank page, and I know why.
Everytime I borrow from him he uses my signature to sell some of my territory to Burgundy to raise the money he lends me.
A prophet has come from Lorraine.
Promising to save France and crown our Dauphin.
The game is we put the
Count of Clermont on the throne, he will pretend that he is the illustrious Charles.
When the evening is over, I shall be Dauphin by popular demand, huh?
Fortunately, that is not enough.
- Now, sit on the throne.
- Please, a little obeisance, my good people.
That's better.
Now, let her enter.
Let her enter, I say.
Ah... there are three of you.
And which may I ask is the maid of Lorraine?
- I am the maid from Lorraine.
- Who are these other maidens with you?
This is Jean de Metz and Bertrand de
Poulengy came with me to guard me.
A family of three?
Sir if you mean anything against the maid or doubt our respect for her
I advice to watch what you say.
My apologies.
I'd rather nobody knelt to me.
Then nobody will. I assure you, it's not a position one chooses for comfort.
But come, here's our great Dauphin.
Well, here I sit waiting for the crown you promised me, maid of Lorraine.
See that I am crowned.
See that I am crowned at once.
Here, your Dauphin offers you his hand, maiden.
My gentle Dauphin it is you I seek.
I've come a long way to find you and no other can take your place.
God has spoken to me thru his messengers.
And it is his will that I come to aid you and that you'll be King of France.
How did you know me?
I can tell you that when we are alone.
What is your opinion?
This girl is dangerous, there must be a third party.
- I could swear she was sent by your enemies.
- My Dauphin, I say to you from this hour the war will change.
And your life will change.
But the truth is, Joan, I'm not the sort of person
God would be very likely to be interested in.
Truely, I'm not.
Though I'm no worse than the others here probably but...
God bothers very little with any of us if you should ask me.
Now, I've been honest with you.
Be honest with me.
What is it you want?
Money?
Lands?
Presents?
I'm a poor man in spite of being...
It is not true that God takes no interest in you.
You say that to hide yourself from me as you just now hid among the women.
But God will find you out.
And make you King.
This is an honest voice.
Listen to her, Charles.
I think you've come just in time.
For a moment... I thought you were the Dauphin.
I'm his cousin, the Duke of Ronson.
I'm glad you're here, good Duke.
The more we gather of the royal blood of France,
- the stronger is our cause.
- Don't trust her my Lord.
I'm trying not to trust her.
But everytime I looked into her eyes,
- I believe what she says is true.
- More reason to distrust her.
Gentle Dauphin, if I tell you things so secret that they are known to you and God alone, will you believe that I am sent by him?
Come with me, Joan.
Nicholas, unhinge from the plow!
Bring your horse!
Come and join the maid's army!
Maid?
She has no army!
- Then she will soon have one!
- Come along, Nicholas!
- Come along!
- Join us!
Men come flocking by the thousands.
The maid's name is magic.
- My people believe in that.
- Nobody holds back?
Why? Why? Why?
The army gathered.
Men are coming from everywhere.
Gold and jewels are dug from the ground and poured into the treasury.
Grain and cattle we couldn't buy are sent as gifts.
You ordered us to raise the army, we've done it.
- But you still haven't given us the word to march.
- But I couldn't very well before the girl had been examined by the archbishop and the officers of the church.
But the examination has finished.
20 learned and loyal priests questioned her over 3 weeks at Poitiers.
They sent to Domremy and Vaoucouieurs for all the available evidence of allure.
The church finds Joan untouched, religious and pure at heart,
- and says so formally.
- Yes.
Although we find nothing except good in her, still we are not certain if it's wise to send her into battle.
At present you are at least alive, Dauphin, but if you throw yourself into this war you may lose not only your kingdom, but your life.
I'm not going to lead the army.
She's going to lead it.
A green country girl leading an army of France?
You will be the laughing stock of Christiandom.
I've been there for a long time.
Thanks to you... and you.
For years you've tried to convince me that
I'm a pretender to my father's throne.
A scoundrel, an imbecile.
At times I've been inclined to believe you.
But then she came... and sort me out.
What did she tell you in the chapel?
I can't tell you that.
And I won't.
You'll tell us.
You've never kept a secret in your life.
I shall keep this one.
The truth is I don't yet know what I want to do.
It's my own head, mind you.
My own head and my crown.
I don't know whether I want to risk them.
But how long are we to wait?
Are we never to relieve Orleans.
I don't know.
I don't know.
The longer you wait the wiser, your Majesty.
I'm not sure of that either.
- Your majesty, l...
- My Dauphin, forgive my bad manners.
For days I've tried to see you but the guard said no, you were in council...
My dear Joan, that cloak becomes you, you look radiant!
I thank you for it, my Dauphin, all preparations are made.
Let us have action.
Men of action and not men of words!
Send me to Orleans, the sign you asked for will be given.
- Now is the time.
- There is always time, Joan.
No, there is not always time, my Dauphin.
Use me well, for I've told you
I shall last a year but a little longer.
Come ride with us to Orleans.
If you wish me to say yes, you must not ask for unreasonable things.
You must not ask me to lead an army.
I warn you again, your Majesty.
It's not common sense to trust this girl.
If it be God's will to deliver Orleans,
Why do you need soldiers?
The soldiers will fight and God will give them victory.
I cound be sure...
You see it's myself that I'm not sure of.
- I'm not sure I would make a good King.
- What you need is faith in God.
When you have that you have faith in yourself.
I'm not sure God wants me to be King.
Why should God send me help, when I am... what I am?
Put aside your doubts and fears, my Dauphin.
Be noble as I have dream you to be, be as God requires you to be, be as France needs you.
Your France, your nation and your people, so helpless without you, but unconquerable as soon as you turn your trust to God.
- Can you look at her face and doubt, my Lord?
- No.
I do not doubt now.
Alenson, take her to the captains.
God is with this girl, and will be with her in battle.
Gentlemen, I present you Joan the maid.
This is Antel,
Couvert,
Poulon,
Derrogaux,
Serseraille, and this is Laire.
Hah! By the wild bull of Bujon!
It's a girl... and in harness! Hahaha!
Laire takes pride in being a plain blood fellow without polish for anybody, so think nothing of his greeting.
He fights well.
If he fights well, I shall like him.
If I'm a fool, God at least does not held it against me.
Joan I promise you, that so long as you don't try to give any commands, we shall all get along well.
Oh, I shall not try to give any commands?
I wouldn't know what commands to give.
By the rock of Moses, that's the first sensible word I heard you say, wench!
You stick to that and by the thunders of God there will be no trouble.
Don't swear, Laire.
Don't swear?
Now, by the black rock of...
There must be no swearing in this army among high or low.
Do you want to strike the army dumb?
- This must begin with you.
- You said you would give no order, Joan.
Oh, but this is not a military order, sir.
Surely you must see that.
But the army that is to march on Orleans was raised in a holy cause.
I saw the men today, there were women among them, they drank and swore.
These things must cease and every man must go to confession before we march.
- Before God...
- Don't swear, Laire.
But if you must, swear by my staff.
By my staff?
What kind of an oath is that?
No army was ever sent to confession.
If we gave such orders, we'll be laughed at.
- I shall give no such command!
- Or any of us, you may be sure of that.
By the swords of Lazarus!
What war have it's leaders had to sit in council with a green country girl?
A pat on that silly Dauphin of ours.
Bad enough when he was a plain coward.
Now he sends children to lead us.
She's not to lead us, you great ark.
She's to ride before us as a sort of symbol, a figurehead for the soldiers to rally around.
No by the love of Janice and all his 2 face
Janissaries, she will not rally me around.
I don't expect she be of much help in battle,
- Nevertheless I'm grateful to her.
- For what?
For giving us another chance.
Do you play this game often?
Every day all day.
That takes it all.
From now on there won't be much time for games.
- It's the maid.
- The maid.
- The maid... the one we follow.
- Is it something we can do perhaps?
Yes.
Pick up your dice for a moment.
Pick up your dice, my friend.
They tell me that armies are like this, that all armies are like this and that there is no changing them.
Yet we cannot have victory we are not worthy of it.
But we came here because you promised victory.
It is true that God has called us to the work we are to do, but it is not enough that God is on our side, we must be on his side.
What are we to do, maid?
There must be no gambling.
- No gambling?
- No, not even in secret.
And you must not swear and take God's name in vain.
- What was that?
- No swearing the maid said.
And you must send away all your women.
- What? What's that?
- No women.
- There must be no camp followers.
- She means us.
And before we march each man must go to confession and clear his soul of all evil he has done.
What does she thinks we are? Monks?
- Be quiet!
- Let her speak!
Please hear me.
As many as can.
You see, there is no strength in me.
And no strength in my hands.
There is no strength in any of our hands great enough to win against the English.
Our strength is in our faith.
And if our faith is eaten away by little things that God hates then, so there be a million of us, we shall be beaten back and die.
Yes, come near!
And you men too!
And those who cannot hear!
Give them this message!
We can win only if we become God's army.
It is not easy to stand here before you, and ask this of you.
Perhaps it will not be easy to do.
But I know that if these things are done then though the English hang from the clouds and ride on the whirlwind, we shall beat them.
Though their arrows fall like hail from the sky and their spears be a ring of steel and their cannons speak and strike like the thunderstorm from heaven, yet they shall be ours!
For this, God has promised.
Our father who is in heaven is our leader.
He will be with us, while we hallow his name.
He will give us all we need.
Our daily bread, our victory and the land that is forever free.
Why are we on this side of the river if that is Orleans?
You've come this way for order of Dunois.
- Bastard of Orleans.
- He commands here?
Yes, girl. That must be he riding out to welcome you.
- Greetings Dunois.
- Greetings, my Lord.
You're most heartedly welcomed, my friends.
More so since you bring the maid with you.
This is the hour.
Now is the time.
In God's name, strike!
Strike boldly!
- Forward!
- Forward!
Forward!
- Forward!
- Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Forward! Man the slits!
Get those cannoneers!
Fire the catapults!
Fire!
Hurry with the meurtriere!
Follow the white banner!
Forward! For God and our country, forward!
Follow the banner!
God is with you all, Lords! All!
Fire!
Break thru the walls! Close with them!
In God's name, forward!
The witch, the witch!
Stay there, coward!
Forward, my friends, forward!
Up and over!
France! France!
God is your protector!
Forward! Forward!
Brave men, good soldiers, hurry!
On the walls!
Archer!
Hurry men!
Altogether, to the walls!
I hit the witch!
She's down, she's down!
She's down, the witch is down!
Victory, England has won!
That must come out, Joan.
Hold my amulet, maid.
It will conjure away your pain.
Thank you, my friend.
No, no thanks.
I rather die than use sorcery.
I'll cleanse your wound with ointment, dress it with lard.
Yes. Bind me.
And I lie here... for a while.
Father Pasquerel, do you hear.
- The Tourre has fallen.
- No, Joan. That's the note for recall.
We've been ordered to retreat.
- Help me to my harness.
- Child, you are wounded.
I don't feel it.
No! No, men of France!
Do not give up!
Courage men, do not fallback!
Laire, Dunois, Alenson, turn back!
Friends, come with me.
We must not give up.
We've done all we can this day, Joan, our men are exhausted.
- The English are just as exhausted.
- We held a council and decided to retreat.
You've been with your council and I've been with mine.
And I say to you, the council of our Lord is better and stronger than yours.
We need only to go forward and the fort is ours!
If she wants to attack, we attack.
When my banner touches the wall
- we shall have victory!
- Sound the trumpets, forward men!
Forward!
Follow the banner!
On your feet!
Do not give up!
For the glory of France!
To the walls! To the walls!
French men, French men!
There is no turning back!
We shall have victory, God wills it!
- To the walls!
- To the walls!
Scale the ladder!
France, rise above!
Death to the enemy!
Forward men, this is the victory!
Resist!
Enter boldly, victory shall be ours!
God say yield!
God say yield!
God say yield!
Yield to redeem your life!
God say yield to redeem your life!
I'll never yield to you, sorceress witch!
You call me harlot, but I have great pity on your soul and the souls of your men!
Yield to the King of heaven!
I say never!
Not to you, fiend from hell!
No, no, no!
Burn in hell!
Death by fire is a horrible thing.
Joan! Joan, we've been looking for you.
Why are you crying?
I thought victory would be beautiful.
Look at this so ugly and bloody.
Why it was never a more beautiful victory than this.
And it's your victory.
The whole city is waiting to receive you.
- You must lead the army through the streets.
- No!
Our soldiers see her banner and run away.
Her victories will be remembered as the most shameful episode of history.
I quite agree with you.
Mighty England and great Burgundy, the richest prince in Christendom, beaten by a green country girl.
My Lord, did you come to me for aid and advice,
I have this to say:
Think, Duke.
Think carefully before you reject the maid and her invitation to the coronation of your dear cousin.
This no moment for jesting,
Count of Luxembourg.
And no subject toyed.
The fact remains that tomorrow in the Catherdral of Reims the maid will crown her dancing master, the Dauphin, King of France.
She's victorious and she has made no mistakes so far.
If she decides to march on París, and no doubt she will,
Paris will be lost... and we'll fall.
This is a grave moment in the history of Burgundy.
- And of England.
- And of the church.
We had to deal with many heretics, but none as dangerous as this one.
The maid a heretic?
I thought the church had examined her and found her good, pious and untouched.
If I had sat as judge of Poitiers,
I can assure you the verdict would have been different.
Count Bishop your hatred for the maid is justified.
Had she chased me from my castle or I was noticed
I would have called her much worst names... than a heretic.
It may be luck for us that she's exactly where she is.
- Luck?
- She's about to make her first error.
Tomorrow she will crown Charles.
She should set the crown on her own head.
Charles is a fool, a gull, a knave.
He sold out to us before.
- He may do it again.
- You offer him money?
Not I, you. For a truce.
For first time in a 100 years
France is victorious,
Why in heaven's name should
Charles grant us a truce?
Dangle gold in front of him and he might take it, he always has.
Tremouille is with him as usual.
And Tremouille would sell anything.
Very well my Lord,
I'll send the messenger away.
- Messenger? What messenger?
- By Burgundy.
- He's here begging for a truce.
- Truce? What nonsense.
How much will they pay?
50,000 crowns if you give the order to stop fighting.
- And how much do you get?
- I? I... I've nothing to do with it.
Your usual share is half, my loving crocodile and you haven't changed.
I want your share.
I want 100,000 in my hands.
And I'm not even sure that I'll take it.
What shall I tell him?
You tell him to wait, we are in no hurry.
Very well, my Lord.
Sire, this is the day we fought for and waited for and it has come.
I'm as happy as any mortal has ever been, for I've watched the anointing and the coronation of my King.
- Hurray!
- Long live the King!
Long live the King!
Joan the Maid!
Joan the maid!
On to Paris!
I'll see the messenger in the robing room.
- Oh, they didn't touch, they didn't touch.
- They kissed, they kissed.
Just as I kiss you now.
Your Majesty...
Only our kissing is a very different matter isn't it, my dear?
- Oh, your Majesty, you must take care.
- No, that's your part to take care.
Mine is to be bold, careless and reckless.
To win the world I win and depart when I choose.
For look, the world is mine.
Look about you, this is a real court now and I'm a King to be reckoned with.
It is lovely, the scent of jasmine.
I could stay here in Sully forever.
Yes, well next week we must go to
Lausa to be feasted,
And the week after that to Pion.
There seems to be no end to these invitations.
And to the tributes!
See?
And for the reference, do you remember that little tailor at Chinon who wouldn't trust me for a new coat?
Now...
Nay, here comes that vulture again.
Well Tremouille, do you come to bring me money?
Or to take it away with you?
Your Majesty, this is a much more important matter than money.
The man's mad.
Here, take my place. And don't cheat!
- She's here.
- Is she alone?
No, she brought Alenson with her.
Remember Sire, it's absolutely imperative that this time you keep your word.
- When have I not kept my word?
- Yesterday.
Well, that was yesterday.
Greetings, my friends.
Joan, we've asked you into the presence because we've missed you, our most favourite subject.
My noble King, for weeks we have waited outside the walls of Paris for your arrival.
We should have struck in the hour of victory.
But it is not too late now.
Keep your promise.
Ride with us and.
Paris shall yet be ours.
I'm sorry Joan but you've to cancel all such plans.
I have just negotiated a truce with Burgundy.
A truce?
- That's madness.
- It's been too much bloodshed.
The Tourre has been terribly torn, we need peace.
Our enemies need peace, my King, but not you.
Let them go home to their island and they can have a good and lasting peace.
We only have to go forward now.
- And their last great stronghold will fall.
- I tell you I have decided upon a truce.
I have decided.
But you cannot do this, my King.
It would mean that you threw away all the advantages.
We have fought so hard and have given so much blood to win.
- His Majesty has signed the truce.
- Signed it?
Yes.
And our King never repudiates his word.
You know how this looks, your Highness?
Like betrayal or stupidity.
Or both!
I never said that I was wise, I never said
I was honest, I never said I was handsome.
I'm not a particularly good person to be a King, but as long as I am a
King, I will be a King.
What do you know statecraft?
What do you know of the experience which the heads of nations must stoop?
A ruler must compromise and bargain with the lowest sort of people, even the enemy.
Men are governed by corruption, they like it.
Men hate corruption and God hates it.
I don't know, but men take to it very naturally.
Cannot be true.
My King, have you taken... money from our enemies?
That is not a question the King should answer. Or be asked.
Then you have done it.
You have betrayed us.
All of us.
Your country and even yourself.
I shall tell the people of
France what you've done.
I hate war, I don't like battles, everytime I see French blood flowing I can...
I can feel the hair rise on my head.
- With all my soul I prayed for peace.
- We are at peace.
We cannot have peace so till our land is free.
It happens that I am the one that decides what war we fight and what peace we keep.
I warn you, make any dirty truce you like.
We'll march on Paris with or without sanction.
No my dear cousin, you will not.
I ordered the dismissal of the army.
I'm sick of all these warriors clanking about in armour.
You Alenson, Laire, Dunois, all of you.
Put down your battleaxes, you're ordered home.
And from now on, all commands come from me.
If my captains leave, I shall leave also.
Not your captains, my captains.
And you also will do as you are told.
Not as you pleased.
- About the present...
- Ah, yes.
Joan, we've decided to ennoble you as a token of our gratitude.
And your town of Domremy will be exempt from taxation.
But you must remain with the court until you are given permission to leave.
Now come and join us.
We'll meet again, Joan.
I was never much for... words, Joan.
Except for profanity.
This is beyond swearing.
Goodbye, dear friend.
And good soldier.
Did you say your prayers this morning?
That's what I forgot.
Remember me when you say them.
Joan, let me kneel to you this once.
You are more to me than any
King or Queen could ever be.
To me you are France and France is yours.
You lifted her up when she was dying and set a cup of victory to her lips.
We all drank from that cup.
To make a new nation of us.
Made new men of all of us.
Many have fallen and now dead, as I could wish I were now that this has happened.
King of heaven,
I've come to fulfill a vow.
The truce with Burgundy signed.
We're at peace and I shall wear this white armour no more.
I leave it here, at your altar.
We're at peace, my King.
But not such a peace as we dreamed.
No, horribly and evil in armies, this was much of the war to be fought.
And our enemy is preparing.
And we dwindle here from town to town, holding court.
Receiving embassies and dismissing soldiers.
From town to town we have feasted.
From city to city I have attended, doing the King's bidding.
We must feast in many more if the plan holds.
Oh, my sweet God, the food is bitter.
I would rather sleep on the ground again and chew my handful of bean and rice and to face the rank of English spears, for this way we shall lose all we have won.
Even I can see that.
And my voices have said nothing.
If only my voices would speak to me again.
If they would tell me what I should do then I could sleep at night and accept what comes to me but they are silent.
I asked again and again.
Must I remain with the King and his household?
Busy with the nothings that fill these days?
If my voices do not answer,
I cannot stay here.
I must arm again and find the enemy and fight as before.
Let my voices speak to me if this is wrong.
Let them speak to me now.
There is still no answer.
Then I must go.
And fight the enemy, King of heaven.
I shall find another armour, not this shining one in which I rode as your messenger.
But another dark and humble, fitting to a common soldier.
Long ago my voices told me that I would be taken prisoner.
When it comes, at least I shall have arms in my hands.
I think I have courage to die.
But not to die thus in small sick ways.
Inform the master that we've bring in the witch.
The maid is captured.
Come here, look!
There's the witch! The witch!
The witch is a young girl!
So you are the maid...
The peasant girl who leads armies, crowns Kings, and sets soldiers quaking in their boots.
As a French men, your great admirer.
As a Burgundian, your fortunate captor.
- At the gates of Compiegne?
- Yes, my Lord.
The city shut the gates in our faces, we descended upon her and her few followers.
- We were careful not to wound her.
- Well done, captain.
My dear, look after her good health.
- You shall be in good hands, Joan.
- They've taken my ring.
I want it back.
His Grace, the Bishop of Beauvals.
- Welcome, your Grace.
- Greetings, Count.
A cup of wine?
Wine is always good over a bargain.
Yes, thank you.
Seems to me, I remember this room under less happy circumstances.
Yes, I remember you were a bit breathless.
You were running from the maid.
- Whom you now have.
- Whom I now have.
Shall I have the money sent up?
5,000 pounds is not enough, your Grace.
I can do much better elsewhere.
5,000 pounds is a great deal of money.
Kings have been ransomed for less.
But this is something different, this is a witch.
Witches are expensive.
5,000. Yes or no?
I've use 10 bags.
The question is does each bag contains 500 or 1,000 pounds.
Bishop, could it be possible that you're lying?
It looks to me as if you're authorised to go as high as 10,000 pounds.
If I said that I were, you would want 15.
If you're a true christain, you'd give her up for nothing.
She's a sorceress, a heretic!
An idolatress!
- She must be burned.
- Oh now, now... wait Bishop.
If this is entirely a religious matter, why do you offer me English coin?
England is a true daughter of our church.
She's with us heart and soul, in the matter of scorching this heresy.
Oh, yes. When the maid beat the English.
Yes of course, that was heresy.
Not to mention her putting you out of your Bishoping.
- Whose side are you on, my friend?
- This same side we're all on.
The me side, what's in it for me.
That's my side, and that's your side.
And the English side, and the French side, and the Burgundian side. Of course... this girl, she's the only one
I know who is not on the me side.
And that's why I'm ashamed when I think I would sell her.
- Yes, even for 10,000 gold pounds.
- Very well, 10,000. Will you take it?
If I am not, may God put me there.
If I am me, may he keep me there.
That is a good answer, Joan.
We can do without your comments.
Who council you to throw off womens clothes and dress like a man?
A thing indecent... and contrary to the teachings of the holy scriptures.
For that I blame no one.
Having lived among soldiers it was more fitting for me to wear mens clothes.
But give me a woman's dress and I will wear it if you permit me to hear mass.
Otherwise I will not put it on since it pleases God that I wear this one.
All I have done, I've done by the command of my Lord.
That is all that I've done well.
How do you know that your voices come from God?
I knew that they came from God because what they commanded me to do was only good.
My Lords, I have answered the same questions at Poitiers.
My King charged the Archbishop of Reims and other loyal and learned priest to examine me before
I was allowed to lead his army.
Send for the records at Poitiers, you shall have all my answers.
The examination at Poiters by the Archbishop of Reims has no relevance.
We are your judges now and you must answer us!
But you are not fitted to be my judges.
You are my mortal enemies.
English... and Burgurdians.
All of you.
And you are not the church.
You are the valets of the enemy King whose orders you obeyed.
If I am being tried by the church, why am I not in a church prison among women.
I am in a English prison guarded by English soldiers and chained... chained to my bed. If I must rise for any purpose I must ask the guards to unlock the bonds.
We, your judges, keep you chained because you've attempted to escape.
Is it not the right of all prisoners of war to try to escape?
You say that you are my judges.
I do not know if you are, but I say this, take care not to judge me wrongly, for in truth I am sent by God and you place yourself in great danger.
Take her back to her cell!
Good day, my Lords.
You and your flawless trial.
The girl's too clever for you!
She ridicules you!
Yes and threatens you in public.
I can assure you, my dear Warwick.
It won't happen again.
No it will not, for there will be no more public sessions.
You will continue behind closed doors according to my orders.
Is that the chapel, Father?
- Yes, Joan.
- May I enter?
No daughter, it is forbidden.
Do you know why?
It is forbidden.
Your Grace, perhaps we should not say no so quickly to this child's request concerning the records of Poitiers.
Since we were not on the maid's side in the war, we can hardly judge her...
- in unbiased fashion.
- This is an ecclesiastical court, governed solely by the unbiased laws of the church.
The laws of the church?
Do they demand English guards at the doors?
Do they insist that English gold bears the expense?
- Silence Calleis.
- No, your Grace.
Such a procedure contravenes our laws.
- I can take no part in this trial.
- Then you may leave.
And any of you who herd his opinion may leave also.
But remember this, if you go now, you carry my enmity with you.
And the enmity of the King of England.
The King of France and England.
I'm sorry to leave what to your mercy.
Or your lack of mercy.
But for my conscience sake
I cannot witness what seems to me but a preconceived and shameful farce.
You will come with us.
- I?
- Yes. You're under arrest.
I should be in a church prison, guarded by women.
Must you leave me here, Father?
I'm commanded to leave you here.
God keep you, child.
Joan, this is Master Jean Laverne, who has been assigned by the most revered Inquisitor of France.
To assist us at you trial.
Master Jean has read all the reports of the preceding sessions.
And is therefore well acquainted with your case.
I am Jean and I promise you that we will judge you justly.
But you're an illiterate girl and need council.
You may choose one of the judges to advise you.
I thank you.
But I have no intention of departing from the council of my Lord.
What do your voices tell you?
To answer you boldly.
Did they promise to deliver you?
Saint Catherine told me that I would be rescued.
I do not know whether this means that I would be delivered by a French attack upon this city Rouen.
Or something else, but I was told that I would be freed by a great victory.
- Can you remember the exact words?
- Yes.
Accept everything with courage.
Do not fear your martyrdom.
For in the end, you shall be in the kingdom of paradise.
What does the voice mean by... your martyrdom?
I...
I am not sure.
It may mean what I suffer here in prison.
Night after night, I have no sleep and still
I must come before you and answer questions.
Same questions.
Come before you've met with what I must endure in my cell.
Without... without rest, without rest, day or night.
I do not know how much more
I would have to suffer.
I reave for myself to God.
This harlot mocks our court!
You ask me questions I have sworn not to answer, and yet you keep asking them.
What do you wish of me that I perjure myself?
Scriveners, stay your hand.
Don't write that answer.
Joan, if we proof to you that you have acted against the faith, are you ready to submit to the church?
I beg you to believe that,
I would never do or say anything against the church.
And if I have done such a thing
I would willingly reject it.
- That is a good answer Joan. Now I...
- If you accept the decision of this court, you would reject your voices.
If you still maintain that your voices are right, you reject the church.
If you do not obey, you are a heretic!
I would not reject the voices of my Lord nor the church!
It seems to me that it is all one.
Our Lord and our church.
Why do you make such a difficulty about it?
Why did you display your banner at the coronation?
It had shared in the toil.
It was only right that it should share in the honour.
I appeal to the Pope who is at Rome.
Take me there and I shall submit to him.
- Silence!
- Silence!
This is very serious, my Lord.
- She is within her rights.
- This appeal is expensive.
- We cannot proceed with the trial.
- We shall proceed.
But if we were to continue, the trial would be illegal and the verdict null.
- You're saved, Joan.
- The devil's tail, Priest!
If I see you whisper to her again
I'll have you thrown into the Seine.
As for this appeal to the Pope,
I refuse to allow it.
The King commands here, not the Pope.
He's paid a high price for this witch.
And he's also paying for your services, my Masters,
Doctors and Bishops.
That is why I appeal to the Pope, who takes orders from no King.
The appeal is overruled.
Erase it from the record!
Yes, you surely write what is against me but nothing that is for me.
Take her away!
May I have your attention, my Lords?
His Grace, the Bishop of Beauvals, send me the articles of accusation of this case, and ask me to give him my opinion of the conduct of this trial.
I assure your Grace, but
I would hardly hope that you would trouble yourself to appear in person.
I fear that my letter might become lost, as so many others have.
However, having witness today's session,
I am ready to render my opinion.
Write this down, Scriveners.
I, Jean, Bishop of Avranche, declared that this trial is unlawful.
That the appeal made by the accused and witnessed by me among others, is definitely and completely suspensive.
And that all future procedure of this case must be referred to Rome.
- Why don't we go to my apartment...
- If the maid's appeal is overruled, it is further proof of the widespread rumours that circulate throughout the Christain world that this is not a religious but a political trial.
I warn you, you the so call judges, you may suceed in sending her to the stake.
But one day, your English King will be ashamed of these proceedings.
Rome will declare the truth about this girl.
And France will praise the maid for it's birth as one nation.
And as for you, Pierre Cauchon,
Count Bishop of Beauvals,
I declare you a traitor, for you have betrayed your country and you betrayed... your church.
Your Grace, at this time I cannot permit...
I will not permit...
Tomorrow morning, in the cemetery of St Ouen, we've decided to hold our last session.
With your physician's consent, we are taking Joan there.
And if she again refuses to abjure, we're abandoning her and handing her over to the civil authorities.
I shall order the execution under being readiness.
This Joan, whom you see before you, has fallen from error into error, from crime into crime.
Never before in France has there appear such a monster.
She's a witch, a heretic, a schismatic even her King himself is a heretic, because he sort to regain his throne with the help of such an apostate, we brought you here to this sacred and divinest cemetary to give you your last chance in public.
Will you or will you not revoke all the acts to which your voices drove you and which where your judges have condemned?
Burn the witch!
Burn the witch!
I submit to God and our holy Father the Pope.
The Pope is in Rome, we cannot go so far.
You must submit to us.
If you do not, we shall hand you over to the executioner now.
I submit to God and our holy Father the Pope.
You must submit to us or die.
If you submit, we'll send you to a church prison.
Do you hear, Joan. If you submit, you'll be taken to a church prison where there will be women guard.
Joan, he's reading the sentence of your excommunication.
Submit.
- This means her death.
- Abjure, Joan!
Abjure!
Abjure!
Abjure?
What does it mean to abjure?
It means to submit to your judges.
If you do, you'll escape the fire and you'll be delivered from the English prison.
Almost, sweet God.
Submit! Submit!
- Abjure Joan!
- Abjure!
- Abjure!
- Please abjure!
Save yourself! Save yourself, Joan!
I submit my words and actions to you.
- I'll abjure than be burned.
- She submits herself! She submits!
Damn!
No, Joan. You'll sign your name.
Silence!
The maid has submitted.
We must receive her with penitence.
In the name of our Lord, Amen.
At last, you've come back to the bosom of our mother church.
And thus we absolve you from the excommunication.
But in order that you should expiate your crimes.
And to make sure that you would not fall back into heresy, we condemn you to perpetual prison, to the bread and sorrow, and the water of affliction.
Father, take me to your church prison.
Give me women to guard me.
No! No!
They told me they would take me to church prison!
Oh! They lied to me!
They lied to me!
No!
Oh, sweet God.
Forgive me. Forgive me.
I was afraid.
What I said... was for fear of the fire.
I have damned my soul to save my life.
You speak to me, and I denied you.
Exactly as I expected.
She has not kept her word.
- She meant nothing of what she said.
- She meant all that she said.
But we have not dealt honestly with her.
The guards are still here, just as before.
She has retained the clothes of a man.
- She has broken her signed abjuration!
- We made it impossible for her to keep it.
- You exceed your function here!
- I appeal to the Inquisitor.
She shall have her sentence and nothing else.
One moment, my Lords.
If this girl has been tricked into breaking her vow,
I will not share in a sentence against her.
If we leave your cell, all of us, will you put on this dress?
No, my Lord, I will not.
I've heard my voices again.
They told me I did a very wicked thing by denying them but they have forgiven me.
I have faith in them.
I have none in you.
This is a fatal answer.
Joan,
Do you know what this means?
To live without faith is more terrible than the fire, more terrible than dying young.
I have nothing more to do here.
Send me back to God for whom I came.
Only a child!
- Someone save her! Save her!
- Back away!
Back away! Back away!
You, the devil Bishop!
In the name of our Lord, Amen.
Could I have a cross!
To hold in my hands!
Ah, what shame that after the abjuration of your errors, the devil of heresy has once more risen in your heart.
You've returned to your crimes, therefore we the judges same decree that you, Joan, commonly called the maid, have been on the subject of your pretended divine revelations.
- A relapsed heretic,
- God bless you.
A sorceress, lying, seducing, pernicious, presumptuous, seditious, cruel, apostate and schismatic.
And so we abandon you to the civil authorities, requesting the same authority that it may be pleased to moderate its judgement and if true signs of penitence should appear that the sacrament of penance may be administered to you.
I am a good Christain.
Executioner!
Do your duty!
Thus the short life of Joan nearing its end.
But the truth will emerge in the pages of history.
Her physical death was not a defeat but her last and greatest triumph.
Father, pray for me.
I will be damned forever,
I've burned a Saint!
Go, child of God, daughter of France!
Go.
- Go!
- Oh, sweet God.
You've been with me always.
Be with me now, through the darkness.
For I meant to hurt no one.
Let none be hurt for me.
Come to her assistance, she sings of God.
Come forth to meet her, the angels of the Lord.
Receiving her soul, offering it in the side of the almighty.
May Christ receive you with chorally and may the angels lead thee to paradise.
And... and that the hour of our death... amen.
Jesus.
Jesus!
Bye, Alvin.
I'll be a-coming back.
Ma.
What are they a-fighting for?
I don't rightly know, child.
I don't rightly know.
Come on, you guys.
Hit the dirt and hit it hard.
Okay, Sarge.
Now look, Ross. That's not a teaspoon you got there, it's a shovel.
- Lay into it.
- Okay, General.
Dig, soldiers, dig.
Dig your way straight down to China.
- Okay, Sarge.
- China?
What's the idea of going to China?
I thought this war was in Europe.
Parsons, Sergeant Early.
Yes, sir.
Which one of your men is York?
He is the big, lanky fellow, fourth from the end, sir.
- Having any trouble with him?
- No, sir. Why?
He's down here as a conscientious objector.
Keep your eye on him.
I want a weekly report.
Yes, sir.
That'll be a big help.
Dig. Dig. Dig.
I've been working in a subway all my life, never thought about the guys that dug it.
But since I'm in the army,
I sure take my hat off to them.
- Subway you say?
- Yeah.
What's this here subway you're talking about?
You mean to say you don't know what a subway is? That guy kidding?
No, they don't have subways where he comes from, I guess.
They haven't? Ain't they civilized?
Where you from?
Pall Mall.
Valley of the Three Forks of the Wolf.
- Where is that?
- Tennessee.
Ain't you ever even seen a subway?
- Ain't never even heard of one.
- You never... What? Heard?
Heard? What kind of talk is that?
Do they all talk that kind of English where you come from?
Well, there ain't any English people down our way, just Americans.
Well, look, a subway is a big hole in the ground, see?
It goes for miles.
- Straight down?
- Yeah... No.
It doesn't go straight down, it goes this way.
- Oh, this a-way?
- Yeah.
- Under the ground?
- Under the ground.
- And trains run through it.
- They run through it?
- Yeah.
- Steam cars?
Steam... No. Steam cars.
- They're electric, Alvin.
- I sure would like to see one of 'em.
You see, they have to run trains under the ground in New York,
- because it's so crowded.
- Crowded? I'll say.
Look, it's the rush hour, the Bronx Express is just pulling in.
I'm standing on the platform, holding back the mob.
The doors open up and I...
You know what I'm talking about?
Just a word now and then.
Well, you see, the people are just coming from work and they wanna get home, see, and they wanna get into the cars all together.
They start pushing,
I'm trying to hold 'em back.
Well, anyway, the doors open up and now, buddy, this is where the fun begins.
"Move back in the cars," I yell.
Ain't no room in there, but I yell,
"Move back in the cars."
Boy, how I used to push 'em in. I used to pack them in like sardines in a can.
That's why they call me "Pusher."
All right, Pusher, that's mess call.
- Get a move on.
- Yes, sir.
This is the one bugle call
I ain't got no arguments with.
- Zaranopolis Nick.
- Ross, Michael T.
Hey, this one's full of grease.
Ain't you got a clean one?
- Clean it, buddy. And keep it clean.
- Sure.
York, Alvin C.
Anything wrong with it?
Well, it sure is a fine rifle gun.
I thought maybe you might have some conscientious objections to it.
No, sir, I ain't.
Careful you don't kill anybody with it till we get to France.
- Next man.
- There you are, York.
Thomas, Bert E.
Boy, look at that shine, is that clean or is that clean?
Look, Sarge, you can eat right off the trigger.
Not bad.
You call that clean?
- What's the matter with it?
- Look.
- I don't see nothing.
- It's full of grease.
Won't that make the bullet come out faster?
Clean it.
That's a good job, York.
Did you ever clean a rifle before?
Ain't never cleaned one like that before.
I done clean my own, though.
So you've got a gun of your own, have you?
- Yes, sir.
- I wouldn't think you'd have one.
Well, the next time get your sling a little higher on your arm.
Okay.
Pull in your necks, soldiers.
Those rookies are gonna start shooting.
Now, remember, you guys, you're using real, live ammunition.
A bullet hasn't got any brains.
It'll hit whatever you aim it at.
So don't start murdering each other.
All right, let's go. Ready on number 30.
Ready, number 30.
Not yet, we'll try it first.
Relax, Ross, loosen up. Yeah, that's better.
Take a deep breath.
Blow, let a little of it out.
Hold it.
Remember, keep your sights on the center of the bull's-eye.
Take up the slack in the trigger gradually.
Don't pull it. Squeeze it slowly.
Just like you were squeezing a lemon.
Ready? Aim.
I can't hold it no more.
All right, Ross, take another one.
Aim.
Fire.
Look, Ross, you had your thumb sticking straight up in the air.
Just like that.
Oh, yeah. That gives me balance.
Oh, it does? It gives you balance, does it?
- Yeah.
- Here.
Load.
Aim.
- Fire.
- Oh, my eye.
Maybe that will teach you to keep your thumb down.
That's something for the rest of you men to remember.
- A miss.
- Miss.
Ready on number 29.
Ready on 29.
Ready, 29.
All right, York. Let's see what you can do.
Aim. Fire.
I ain't much good at this here practicing,
Sergeant.
All right, next time get that sling a little higher on your arm.
Press your cheek a little closer to the stock.
Yes, sir.
Make sure that front sight divides the rear sight in half.
I reckon I know about that, Sergeant.
You reckon you know about that, do you?
We'll see. Here.
Load. Aim.
Fire.
- A miss!
- Miss.
So you know about sighting, do you?
I sure thought I cut plumb center that time.
You did, huh?
I can't no ways see how I can miss that whole great big target.
Sharpshooter York requests a re-mark.
Re-mark for 29.
Re-mark, 29.
Oh, I didn't see that one.
- A bull's-eye, 4:00.
- Bull's-eye.
I can't figure out how I got way down there on the edge.
Well, I reckon I can do a little better when I get used to this here rifle gun.
Here's five chances to do better.
Fire when ready.
Hey, what are you wetting that front sight for?
Why, it kind of cuts down the haze.
I always wet my sights when I'm fixing to do some shooting.
Okay, do some shooting.
- Bull's-eye, dead center.
- Bull's-eye.
Okay, York. You're on your own.
- Bull's-eye.
- Bull's-eye.
- Bull's-eye.
- Bull's-eye.
- Bull's-eye.
- Bull's-eye.
Hey, look at this.
Right through the marker.
That ain't no rookie, that's Buffalo Bill.
Let's see that target, Sergeant.
Bring 29 to the firing line.
There's the first shot, and here's the other five here.
I reckon that there gun shoots a might to the right.
Where did you learn to shoot, York?
Well, I ain't never learnt, Sergeant.
Folks back home used to say
I could shoot a rifle before I was weaned.
But they was exaggerating some.
Now, supposing these here cartridges is a flock of wild turkeys, a-flying across the ridge coming this a-way, see, right at me.
Now, which one of them would you shoot first?
I'd take a crack at all of 'em and trust to luck.
Well, you wouldn't have no luck that way, Pusher.
No? Well, then I'd pick the motorman.
- The what?
- The motorman. The guy out in front.
Well, that ain't right either, if you wanna get more than one turkey.
Now, which one of them's got the most meat on him?
Yeah, what's the answer?
Well, now, if you shoot this one here, the leader, the rest of 'em will see him drop and fly off, see?
So, you draw down on the last turkey here, and then the next one, see?
Kind of coming from back to front.
Then the rest of 'em won't know they're being hit.
And, if...
Of course, they might flare off some when the shooting starts, but if a fellow's got himself a repeating rifle, he's got a good chance of getting the whole flock.
- Sounds all right.
- Turkeys sure is dumb animals.
Seems you picked up a good bit down in the hills, Alvin.
Oh, anybody that's done any hunting knows that.
Alvin C. York!
Report to Major Buxton immediately.
- Yes, sir.
- What have you been up to now?
I don't know.
I've been aiming not to make no trouble.
It's your move.
- Private York reporting, sir.
- Yes, York. At ease.
York, Captain Danforth has just handed me a report concerning you, made by your company sergeant.
Yes, sir?
You have a very excellent camp record.
Well, I'm mighty glad to hear that, sir.
You applied for exemption, I believe, as a conscientious objector.
Yes, sir.
Well, I think we can disregard that.
York, Sergeant Parsons recommends your promotion to the rank of corporal with special detail as instructor in target practice.
Captain Danforth and I heartily approve.
I congratulate you, York.
Well, I'm much obliged to you,
Major Buxton and Captain Danforth.
Well, I'll learn 'em fellows to shoot the best I can, like I already done Pusher and Bert.
I mean, Privates Ross and Thomas, sir, but, well, I don't want to be no corporal.
- What's that?
- I said I don't want to be no corporal.
- Why not?
- Wait a minute, Captain. Let him talk.
Well, you see, I...
Is it because of your religious convictions, York?
Yes, sir. That's it.
You see, I believe in the Bible, and I'm a-believing that this here life we're living is something the Lord done give us.
And we got to be a-living it the best we can.
And I'm figuring that a-killing other folks ain't no part of what he was intending for us to be a-doing here.
Well, yes. In a way I agree with you.
York, with your permission, Major?
Certainly, Captain. Sit down, York.
You... You say you believe in the Bible?
Yes, sir.
Well, I do, too.
But do you believe that the Bible means that a man shouldn't fight for what he believes to be right?
Well, it done said,
"Blessed are the peacemakers."
Yes, I know, but...
You remember that verse,
I think it's in Luke, where he says, "He that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one"?
He said that to Peter.
But he doesn't stop Peter from using his sword.
He said, "Them that lives by the sword will be a-perishing by the sword."
That were further on.
- Yes, I remember, but...
- No, go ahead, Captain, go ahead.
But according to St. John, he said, "My kingdom is not of this world.
"If my kingdom were of this world, then would my servant fight."
Well, that's just the point, Captain.
He done said his kingdom were not of this world.
And that... That is different.
- Yes, but...
- Just a moment, Captain.
York, have you ever read this?
"History of the United States."
It sure is a lot of writing.
- Daniel Boone?
- Yeah.
You know about him?
Well, everybody down our way knows about Daniel Boone.
First man into the Valley of the Three Forks.
Yes, he was quite a man, one of the greatest.
And that book's full of great men.
York, what do you suppose that
Boone was looking for when he went out alone into the wilderness?
Well, I never thought much on it.
Was he looking for new lands?
- Might be.
- Maybe.
Maybe for something more.
Something that a man just can't see with his eyes or hold in his hands.
Something that some men don't even know they have until they've lost it.
- Yes, sir.
- To be free.
Now, that's quite a word, freedom.
I think that's what he wanted.
I think that's what sent Boone into your Tennessee country.
Is that what...
That what this here book's about?
Yep.
That's the story of a whole people's struggle for freedom from the very beginning until now.
For we're still struggling.
It's quite a story, York.
How they all got together and set up a government, whereby all men were pledged to defend the rights of each man, and each man to defend the rights of all men.
We call it a government of the people, by the people and for the people.
Why, I never knowed it was all written down.
- You're a religious man, York.
- Yes, sir.
You want to worship God in your own way.
Yes, sir.
- You're a farmer?
- Yes, sir.
You want to plow your fields as you see fit, and raise your family according to your own likes?
And that's your heritage and mine, every American's.
But the cost of that heritage is high.
Sometimes it takes all we have to preserve it, even our lives.
How you gonna answer that, York?
Well...
You done given me a powerful lot to be a-thinking about.
Well, take your time.
Well, if I could only get home, back in 'em there hills, I...
- What would you do?
- Well, I could...
I could figure something out.
I've done a heap of thinking up yonder there once.
All right, take 10 days' furlough.
You mean I can go home?
And when you get back, if you still can't see it our way,
I'll recommend your exemption.
- You will?
- Report to me as soon as you get back.
I'll arrange your furlough, York, starting tomorrow.
- Thank you.
- Good luck.
I sure would like to read this here book.
Go ahead. Take it with you if you want to.
You can borrow it.
Thank you, Major Buxton.
Thank you, Captain Danforth.
Come on, boy.
Want me to be a-setting four places, Ma, or just three?
Can't say, child.
Ma, ain't Alvin ever gonna eat again?
The Book says man don't live by bread alone.
Well, what about that there hound dog he's got with him?
He can't read the Book.
Get the table set.
He's up at the point. Been up there all day.
Want George to go get him, Ma?
Let him be.
Put your trust in the Book, Alvin.
But here's another book, York.
The History of the United States.
Them that lived by the sword, will be a-perishing by the sword.
The government of all men to defend the rights of each man.
And each man to defend the rights of all men.
Remember, the Lord done said,
"Thou shalt not kill."
But the cost of that heritage is high.
Sometimes all we have to preserve it, even our lives.
- Obey your God.
- Defend your country.
- Your God.
- Your country.
- Your God.
- Your country.
- God.
- Country.
- God.
- Country.
- God.
- Country...
"Render therefore unto Caesar
"the things which were Caesar's,
"and unto God the things that were God's."
Caesar... The things which were Caesar's.
And unto God, God's.
- Private York reporting, sir.
- Have him come in.
Yes, sir. Go in, Sergeant.
I'm a-bringing your book back, Major.
And I'm a-thanking you.
Well, you're welcome, York.
I done what you told me,
I thought things over.
- Well?
- I'd like to stay in this here army.
I rather hoped that you would, York.
But there's just one thing, sir, that I ought to tell you.
There's lots of things...
There's lots of things
I ain't figured out yet.
Lots of things still a-going on in my mind.
But it's...
Well, it's just like Pastor Pile done told me.
I reckon I can just be a-trusting in something that's a heap bigger than I be.
York, as your superior officer, I don't feel called upon to look into your conscience.
It's enough for me that I trust you.
And I believe that when the time comes, you'll conduct yourself as a soldier should.
Thank you, sir.
And I'm going to approve your promotion to the rank of corporal.
Well, I'll sure take care of my men the best I can, sir.
I know you will, York.
- That's all.
- Thank you, Major.
Aren't you...
Aren't you taking quite a chance, Major?
You mean as to whether he'll fight or not?
No, I don't think so, Captain.
I don't think I'm taking any chances at all.
"Dear Mom,
"am feeling just fine and have taken in all the sights.
"And Bert took me to a church called Notre Dame Cathedral.
"It's big enough inside for a fellow to plant a crop of corn.
"Pusher just come in.
"He's saying our outfit is moving up to front pretty soon.
"I reckon that's so
'cause we got all our training
"and they ain't brought us here for no sight-seeing tour..."
"Tour, nohow.
"Gracie wrote in her letter she was a-worrying.
"Tell her, don't."
I was feared. I'm a-feared for Alvin.
It ain't right for us to be a-feared, Gracie.
Alvin's in good hands.
The Lord takes care of 'em that's a-believing in Him.
- Any of you blokes got a cigarette?
- Yeah.
- Here you are.
- Thanks.
You know, you Yanks just got here in the nick of time.
We're running shy of these.
Besides, we can do with some help.
Look out.
It takes a while, but you'll learn when to flop and when not to.
They say you never hear the one that's hit you.
That's only half the truth.
No, the whole truth is, if you hears it, you've got a chance.
Duck.
See what I mean?
- Heinie's got the range good.
- Yeah. A guy can get killed around here.
- Look out.
- Don't be afraid. This one'll pass over.
See?
Takes time, it do.
But you'll get the hang of it.
Duck again.
If that was shrapnel, now, we wouldn't be flopping at all.
You know, you only flop for...
Okay, Bert. The Express has gone through.
Hey, Bert!
If one's got your name on it, there's nothing you can do.
So you see, gentlemen, the grave responsibility rests upon us.
This entire German salient, holding up the Argonne advance depends for ammunition and supplies on the Decauville Railroad, which as you know, lies just beyond these hills.
It must be taken.
This is all open country ahead, but you can expect heavy machinegun fire from these wooded ridges on the right and the left flanks.
But we've got to get through.
Synchronize your watches.
Use as a mark, 4:32.
It is now minus 10, eight, six, four, two, mark.
Any questions?
What about artillery support,
Captain Tillman?
Artillery will lay down a rolling barrage at 6:00.
Zero hour will be 6:10.
I'd like to know where that barrage is that we're supposed to have.
Runners, notify the platoon commanders that we go over, barrage or no barrage.
First platoon at 6:10, second and third platoons to follow in waves of 100 meters.
Yes, sir.
- 6:10. All right.
Come on, men!
Halt and take cover!
We'll never get through.
We gotta wipe out those nests.
Early, take what's left of your section and work your way back around that hill.
Maybe you can jump 'em from behind.
All right. Savage, York, Cutting.
Bring your men. Come with me.
Take cover.
Listen.
Heinie!
Listen.
We're not far enough back.
Savage, keep the men quiet.
Cutting, come up here with that bayonet.
We're right behind their lines.
We'll skirt this ridge and flank 'em.
Look! Heinies!
Come on, get 'em.
Hold your fire!
Fall on down and keep 'em covered.
Spread out, men! Spread out!
Line 'em up and disarm 'em!
- Get back there.
- Get 'em up there.
Go on.
- I'm hit bad, Cutting.
- Me, too.
Savage.
Savage?
Where's Savage?
I seen him go down.
They like to cut him in two.
You're the only noncom left.
York, take over.
- Did you hear what I said?
- I heard you.
Watch this fellow.
The rest of you keep under cover.
Come back here.
- Where are you going?
- You done give me command.
Hey, Alvin!
Well, he cleaned out that machine gun nest.
Zeekenny, Donahue! The rest of you guys, keep your eye on them Heinies so they don't try any rough stuff.
Don't try anything funny.
Belly to the ground, you babies.
We better get up there.
No, we better keep an eye on these prisoners.
Five will get you 10 that guy knocks off your whole sauerkraut army.
There are 25 machine guns on that ridge.
- Tell him it's useless.
- What did you say?
I said tell him it's useless.
You tell him.
You talk better English than I do.
Just like a flock of turkeys.
All right. Come on out of there! All of you!
Come this a-way.
Tell the rest of them fellows to quit shooting and come on out of there.
Keep 'em hands up and start a-going down the hill there.
Keep a-coming.
Go on. Move out of there, down the hill.
All right. Keep a-coming.
Hey, down there. Don't do no shooting.
All right, get on down!
Come on out and keep your hands up.
Boy, I told you.
Look at that mob.
Hey, we can't handle all that gang.
Sure we can. That's my mate.
Come on, step lively. Move forward.
Get going.
- Move forward.
- Move it, now.
Move forward, there.
Come on, step up. Step lively there.
Come on.
- All right.
- Get those hands up. Get in there.
- Come on.
- Come on, get going.
Nice going, York.
- Come on there. Come on.
- Come on, get in there.
Get those hands up.
Come on, move fast. Move.
- Hiya, Pusher.
- That was a good job, pal.
- Where's the Sergeant?
- Over there. Hurt pretty bad.
- How many men we got left?
- Eight, besides you.
Watch them fellows.
Get in there, you guys.
Move forward. Move...
Pusher.
Pusher.
This is where we change cars, Alvin.
The end of the line.
Who done that?
Who throwed that grenade?
Come on, you, put your hands up and keep 'em up.
You know what I'm a-saying?
- You understand?
- Yeah.
Tell 'em men of yours if any more of that happens you and a lot more of 'em's going to be mighty sorry.
Go ahead.
Tell 'em to drop their belts.
Look them fellows over good.
- You ready back there?
- Okay here.
- Okay. Ready here.
- Watch 'em.
Now, get going.
Tell 'em to halt.
If you wanted to get back to the American lines, which way would you be a-going?
Up there.
We'll go this a-way. Go on.
Hey, tell 'em to halt.
What's up?
Sounds like them Heinies is making a heap of trouble.
- What are we gonna do about it?
- Get 'em.
We got enough to take care of already.
And a few more won't make no difference.
Hey, you.
Signal up there and tell 'em they're surrounded.
Tell 'em to drop their guns and come down with their hands up.
Hey, this gun touches off kind of easy.
They sure are trained good, Major.
Hey, Sarge, look.
- Looks like Heinies.
- Stand ready.
Hello, there!
- A Yank.
- It may be some kind of a trick.
- There's something funny here.
- Let 'em get a little closer.
- Hello there!
- Who are you?
Detail of the 328th.
We got some prisoners.
- Halt where you are.
- Halt!
That's a Yank, all right.
- Come out, let's have a look at you.
- Watch 'em, fellows!
Keep 'em covered.
Where you going?
Can you tell me where the 328th be?
It's up that way someplace.
- Where did you pick up all this bunch?
- Back up the line a ways.
You couldn't be taking 'em off our hands, could you?
What would we do with them?
Well, I don't rightly know.
- Can we be going?
- Sure. Go ahead.
Thank you.
Come on.
Forward!
All right. Halt!
Prisoners, hold right there!
Be a-watching 'em, Joe.
Beg your pardon, sir.
Yeah?
We all got some prisoners, can we be a-leaving 'em here?
Put 'em right over there.
Wait a minute.
How many have you got?
Well, I done counted 132 heads, sir.
We haven't room for that many here.
Take them back up the line.
- Yes, sir, but...
- But what?
Well, sir, we can't find our outfit and we tried to drop 'em off two other places.
And they ain't but only eight of us to handle them.
- You should've brought more men.
- But that's all there were of us, sir.
You mean to say that you and seven others captured all that bunch?
Yes, sir.
And we'd kind of like to get rid of 'em.
Well, good Lord.
I guess we can give you some help.
- Come on, Sergeant.
- Thank you.
Hey, Sarge! York by himself captured 132 Germans.
Guy named York got 132 Heinies all by his lonesome.
- How did he do it?
- Must have surrounded him.
- Guy named York.
- That's what they say.
Gee, he captured hundreds of Boche and machine guns.
Guy named York! All by his lonesome!
Hey, what's that? How many?
A whole division and a lot of high officers.
- I'm telling you, York?
- Who's they?
Yeah, about half the German army and a general.
- I don't know.
- One guy.
How could one guy...
- Guy named York.
- What's that?
They say he captured Hindenburg.
And the Crown Prince.
And brought them all back. They say...
Say, Sarge, did you hear?
York captured the Kaiser.
Now, as I understand it, York, your detail came over that ridge there and captured about 30 men, right down in here.
Yes, sir.
Then you were forced to cover by a machine gun that was right up on this other ridge.
Yes, sir. Right up there.
Where were you?
Well, I was...
I was a-laying behind that log there.
They was machine-gunning us pretty heavy, so I worked my way across up behind that log there under the hill.
Rather incredible, wasn't it, York, your being able to cross so much open ground without being hit?
I reckon the good Lord was a-protecting me, sir.
What did you wanna go over there for?
Well, I figured that was a good place to be because they had to rear up and show themselves in order to shoot at me and the rest of the boys back here.
And whenever they did,
I could touch 'em off.
I see.
So, I went up the hill, up around that a-way, then worked my way down the ridge to a place where they was flanked and couldn't show themselves without being hit.
So, they... Well, they finally gave up.
How many did you kill?
I don't rightly know, sir.
I think Captain Danforth is familiar with that, sir.
We counted about 20 bodies altogether up around there.
What were your men doing all this time, Corporal?
Well, I couldn't just answer that, sir.
I was pretty busy and I reckon they was, too.
According to the statements of the others, they were guarding the prisoners and couldn't expose themselves to the fire from the ridge.
All right, gentlemen. That's all, Corporal.
Corporal.
- There's something that I'd like to know.
- Yes, sir?
That night that you reported back to me at Camp Gordon, you as much as told me that you were quite prepared to die for your country, but not to kill.
What made you decide to change your mind?
Well, sir...
Of course, if you'd rather not tell me, why, it's quite all right.
Well, I'm as much against killing as ever, sir.
But it was this way, Colonel.
When I started out I felt just like you said.
But when I hear them machine guns a-going and all them fellows are dropping around me,
I figured that them guns was killing hundreds, maybe thousands, and there weren't nothing anybody could do, but to stop them guns.
And that's what I done.
You mean to tell me that you did it to save lives?
Yes, sir. That was why.
Well, York, what you've just told me is the most extraordinary thing of all.
Sergeant York!
Thank you, sir.
And for conspicuous gallantry beyond the call of duty, you have been awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.
Sergeant York, I am proud that you are of the All-American Division.
It's a privilege to command such men as you.
Sergeant York, as Commander-in-Chief of the American Expeditionary Forces, it is my pleasure to confer upon you the United States
Congressional Medal of Honor for heroism beyond the call of duty.
Thank you, sir.
I'm Cordell Hull, Sergeant York, representative from your district of Tennessee.
I'm mighty glad to meet you, Mr. Hull.
And this is Mr. Harrison from the Tennessee Society.
Tennessee is indeed proud, Sergeant.
- Thank you.
- This way, Sergeant.
Well, Sergeant, what do you think of it?
Appears like everybody's having a mighty good time.
So, Sergeant, in the name of the people of New York, may I present you with this key to our city as a token of our very great esteem.
And may God bless you.
Thank you for what you said, and I'm sure grateful to you for this here key.
Well, thank you. And thank you all.
Now, Sergeant, the people of New York would like to show their appreciation.
Is there anything we can do for you?
Well, there's just one thing
I'd like to ask you.
And that is?
Well, if it's all the same to everybody,
I sure would like to ride on the subway on the Bronx Express.
I think we can arrange that.
Well, here we are.
I hope you will be comfortable here,
Sergeant York.
Well, if it ain't, I'd be pretty hard to please.
If there's anything you require, all you will have to do is ask for it.
Thank you. Thank you, sir.
An awful lot of room for just one fellow here.
This here is mighty thoughtful of you, gentlemen.
I reckon you know I ain't seen my ma for quite a spell.
So we understand.
Representative Hull.
Oh, yes, yes. Are they ready?
Put them on.
- Somebody for you, Sergeant.
- Me?
Thank you.
Hello. Hello there.
What?
Who is it?
I... I can't hear you.
- Who is it?
- What's that you're saying?
I can't hear you.
Put it up to your ear, Mother York.
Stand closer, Ma.
When are you coming home, Alvin?
I said, when are you coming home?
Oh, I'm glad, Son.
I'll tell her.
She's right here.
He wants to talk to you, Gracie.
It's me, Alvin. It's me, Gracie!
We're all in here in Pastor Pile's store.
He's got this here phone in here now.
Oh, I just can't wait to see you again,
Alvin.
I can't wait to see you.
Yeah, yeah. I'll be coming home, Gracie, right away.
Yeah.
- Goodbye. Goodbye, Gracie.
- Goodbye, Alvin.
Bye.
Sure was nice to talk to the folks.
- I'm a-thanking you.
- You're welcome, Sergeant.
Just like the electric signs down the street.
How do you like New York, Alvin, as much as you've seen of it?
- Mr. Hull?
- Yes, Alvin?
I wanna be a-going home.
When do you think I can go?
- You're pretty anxious, I reckon.
- Yes, sir, I am.
I've got to get to work.
Well, as far as that goes, there's plenty to do right here, Alvin.
What do you mean?
I've been wanting to talk to you about this.
You're a pretty famous man now.
And judging by all these offers you've been getting, it seems a lot of people realize it.
For instance, two companies want you in motion pictures,
Ziegfeld wants you in an act in his new Follies.
And here's an offer to appear at the Winter Garden, that's a theater.
And here's a breakfast food manufacturer who wants you to endorse his product.
What does that mean?
Well, you've to tell him how much you like it, how much good it's done you.
I ain't never ate any of that there breakfast food.
Doesn't seem to make any difference.
Anyway, I've totaled the offers so far and they amount to around a quarter of million dollars.
They're offering me all that money?
It's just a plain business proposition.
I sure could do a powerful sight with that money.
There was a piece of bottomland
I was a-trying to get...
Here's your chance to get it.
Are they offering that money because of what happened over there?
- Well...
- That's it, ain't it?
That's it.
What... What would you do, Mr. Hull?
Well, I think that's up to you, Alvin.
I reckon it is.
Take all the time you want to think it over.
I've done thought it over, Mr. Hull.
I ain't proud of what happened over there.
What we done in France was something we had to do.
Some fellows done it ain't a-coming back.
So, the way I figure, things like that ain't for buying and selling.
So I reckon I'll have to refuse 'em.
Would you be a-telling them that for me, please?
And tell 'em I'm a-going home?
- I'll be more than glad to, Alvin.
- Thank you, Mr. Hull.
Here she comes, Zeke. Right on time.
Oh, there he is!
Alvin!
Oh, Alvin!
How are you?
Ma, I'm back.
I'm right glad, Son.
Hey, Alvin. How about your medals?
- What about 'em, George?
- I thought you'd be wearing 'em.
You'll be a-seeing 'em.
They better be a-something big.
As I was saying, Alvin, of course, I always figured on marrying you and Gracie myself, but I ain't one to take the job away from the Governor of the State.
Why, you're the dang-swangest hero raised in these parts since Daniel Boone and Andy Jackson.
Sure are, Alvin.
Hang on, Rosie.
Hey, what about that there piece of land
I was aiming to get in Tomkins holler?
- It's still there, I reckon?
- Yep, it's still there.
Somebody else has got it by now,
I suppose.
Well, I couldn't rightly expect Zeb to hold it for me all this time.
I sure would like to see that there piece of land, though.
I reckon ain't no harm you seeing it, Alvin.
I'd like to be a-seeing it, too.
I'll let you off at the fork and you and Gracie can walk over to the holler.
Hang on, everyone.
Hey, look here.
- Somebody's done fixed up this old bridge.
- Yeah, they have.
Gracie, I... I gotta talk to you.
It wasn't just the land
I was a-wanting to see.
There's something we got to talk about.
- Miss Gracie, I'm plumb worried.
- What about, Alvin?
Well, what with the governor fixing to marry us and all them people coming here from all over...
Sure takes a body's breath away, but I reckon we'll get through it all right.
- Well, it ain't just that I'm worried about.
- Well, what then?
Well, it sure looks like I ain't got nothing to offer you excepting a big wedding.
Why, some girls don't even get that.
Well, I reckon you'd like a place to sleep, wouldn't you?
Oh, I don't know.
I done a heap of sleeping while you was away.
You sure ain't expecting too much of a husband.
I'm expecting my husband to love me.
I reckon the good Lord will take care of the rest.
Well, looks like he's done a heap already, just a-having you. But...
Well, I was expecting to take over from here myself.
I reckon you'll get to do your share.
No, Gracie, it can't be that a-way.
We got to wait.
Maybe in another two or three years, if you're willing to wait...
Oh, but I ain't, that's the point.
- You mean you won't wait?
- There ain't no need of waiting.
Now, Alvin, you keep looking down and don't you be looking up till I tell you.
Come on.
There! Now you can look.
What do you see, Alvin? Tell me.
It's yours, Alvin. It's all yours.
They give it to you.
The people of the state of Tennessee for what you done.
- You mean...
- Only, it's 200 acres and the house is bigger, with more windows, and the kitchen's got a pump.
And it's for us.
The Lord sure does move in mysterious ways.
Come on.
- This is a film about that scale and grandeur.
This is a film about that military achievement.
This is a film about a people who, for all time, shattered the legend of Nazi invisibility.
This is a film about victory and defeat.
German victory, and German defeat.
This is the battle for Russia, a battle that has been going on for centuries, a battle that fills the pages of Russian history.
The Germany order of Teutonic Knights had invaded northeastern Russia, and occupied the old city of Pskov.
Under the leadership of their grandmaster, von Bock, they threatened to enslave the whole population of that area, including the capital, Novgorod.
In their hour of peril, the Russian people turned for leadership to their prince, Alexander Nevsky.
And on April 5th, 1242, on Lake Peipus, the Russians met the might of the German forces.
They weren't as well equipped or as well organized.
- But in their hearts was a flaming courage, a flame so fierce that it pierced the German army.
The victory they won fills a bright page of Russian history.
1704, and another conquering army marched across Russian land.
This time, under Charles
XII of Sweden, and again, the Russians fought for their country.
Led by their emperor, Peter the Great, after five long years of war, they defeated the Swedes, in the historic battle of Poltava.
- The invading
Swedish armies were crushed, and forever driven out of Russia.
Napoleon and his armies have blazed their triumphant way across Europe, and were marching on Moscow.
Conquering armies entered the city, but they entered a city in flames.
Even in that day, Russian earth was scorched earth to an invader, and once again, the invader was forced to start the long march on the road back out of Russia.
1914, and another German army, this time, under Kaiser Wilhelm, set out to conquer Russia.
This time, the Russian people, under the regime of the czar, were not only fighting German guns but oppression and corruption in their own country, and only the ultimate collapse of imperial Germany saved Russia from losing the Ukraine and the Crimea, which the Germans had occupied in 1918.
Yes, for 700 years, the Russian people have had to fight and defend their land against would-be conquerors.
Why?
Why have all these attempts been made to conquer Russia?
Perhaps Russia itself can provide the answer.
Here it is.
One sixth of the Earth's surface, reaching from east to west, nearly halfway around the world, and southward from the North
Pole to the borders of India.
One country of nine million square miles.
That's our own country three times over, or all of North America, and a million square miles to boot.
The sun never sets on Russia.
When it is dusk on its western borders, facing Europe, it is already dawn on its eastern borders facing the Pacific.
That's Russia, or to be correct, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
Deep in its mountains lie thick, rich veins of gold and silver.
Below ground lie enormous deposits of copper, tin, manganese and nickel, chromium and radium, sulfur and magnesium.
Russia is rich in raw materials.
Her forests cover millions upon millions of acres.
One fourth of all the lumber reserve in the world belongs to Russia, and as for fuel, there's coal, ton upon ton, and more important, there's also oil,
213 million barrels a year of it, black gold flowing from the earth, that contains 55 percent of the world's oil.
What else?
Iron?
Russia has better than 10 billion tons.
That can make a lot of steel before it's done.
Yes, Russia is rich.
Her farms cover millions upon millions of acres, the rich black earth that besides giving forth oil and coil, will also grow everything from sunflowers to lotus.
The tea your people drink in such huge quantities, and the tobacco that they smoke.
Cotton grows here, too.
Three million, 800 thousand bales a year, and sugar, and on the pasture land, the animals grow fat for food and wool for clothing, while on the warm plains, the fields of grain stretch as far as the eye can reach.
Corn, oats, hops, rye, and don't forget wheat.
One third of the world's best.
Yes, Russia is very rich, for it has not only raw materials and the products of its soil,
Russia is also people.
193 million people.
People of every race, color and creed, people coming from the many different republics that comprise The Soviet Union, people speaking more than a hundred different languages, but all citizens of one country.
Whether they are the great Russians, the descendants of the first settlers of this vast area, and for a thousand years, its main population, or Cossacks, or famous horsemen from the open plains of the Don River Valley.
Whether they come from the southwest, the Ukraine.
Here in the bread basket of the Soviet Union live the little Russians that are known as Ukrainians, and beside them, the
Moldavians and Bessarabians, but if they come from the far south, between the Caspian and Black Seas.
Where we find the Armenians and the Georgians, the Ingush, the Chechens, and rugged as the high peaks of their native Caucasus Mountains.
Whether they are Uzbeks, Turkmen, Kyrgys, from the Persian and Indian frontiers.
Or Mongols.
The Bashkirs, the Turko-
Tartars, the Buryats, the Yakuts, from beyond the Ural Mountains, or the people of the ice country, hunters like the Saamis.
Or settlers like the Laplanders.
Whether they come from the pioneering wilderness of the far north, or from a great city, like their capital, Moscow, where the ancient buildings of an ancient civilization stand beside the modern structures of a modern civilization, where the old Russian droshky still competes with the modern limousine.
Whether they work in factories or as soldiers, whether they are brick layers or traffic cops, sailors or riveters, school children or farmers, nurses or engineers, window washers or sales girls, housewives or postal clerks, radio announcers or stewardesses, scientists or typists, musicians or ballerinas.
Regardless of what they do or where they live, they all have one thing in common: love of their soil.
That is Russia.
Size?
The largest country in the world.
Raw materials?
Unlimited.
Man power?
193 million.
These are three reasons why ever conqueror in history has wanted Russia, and these are the reasons why the modern would be conqueror wrote.
- "When we speak of new territory,
"we must think of Russia.
"Destiny itself points the way there."
- Yes, as we have seen,
Germany's spirit of aggression was handed down from generation to generation, and now, in Hitler's Germany, the dream was world conquest.
For such a dream, there could be only one answer: collective security.
So with this objective, in 1934, the Soviet Union joined the League of Nations.
Again and again before the League, its representatives urged binding agreements to support by collective action any nation submitted to attack.
- The State I represent entered the League with the sole purpose of the maintenance of invisible peace.
The League of Nations is still strong enough by its collective actions to avert or arrest aggression.
There is no room for bargaining or compromise.
- But while some members of the League were pleading vainly for the use of collective force to stop aggression, the world saw other members,
Germany, Italy, Japan, withdraw from the League to follow the path of aggression.
Manchuria, Ethiopia, then Hitler invaded Austria,
Czechoslovakia, and in 1939, Poland.
First step on the road to Russia.
But his eastward march was interrupted by France and Britain declaring war.
So the Germans were forced to turn west, and in 1940, as we have seen, wiped the last opposition from western Europe, and while the Nazis were unsuccessfully trying to bring Britain to her knees, the German generals were already planning to resume the interrupted eastern blitz.
The road to Russia was now open, but before that attack, preliminary steps were necessary.
South and east of Germany are Hungary, Romania,
Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Greece, and Hungary had grain, rich fields of it, grain too good for Hungarians, when German soldiers have such good appetites.
Hungary had bauxite.
Bauxite makes aluminum, and aluminum makes planes, and Hungary had an army, not the battle trained German army, but good enough to throw against Russian guns.
Romania had not only grain, but oil, and Hitler needed every last drop of it to power his war machine.
Romania also had men, more slave labor, and more cannon fodder for the attack on Russia.
And most important,
Romania and Hungary both had Russian frontiers, and
Hitler wanted those frontiers in the hands of German generals.
Bulgaria didn't have a Russian frontier, but it did have bases, bases on the Black Sea, bases for German submarines to prey on Russian shipping.
By the spring of 1941, the reactionary governments of Hungary, under the dictatorship of
Admiral Horthy of Romania, governed by young King Michael, who was only a tool in the hands of Hitler's puppet,
General Antonescu, and of
Bulgaria, ruled by King Boris, always a disciple of German imperialism.
All had sold their countries out to Hitler.
Now, threatened by a revolt of their peoples, they were only too glad to be protected by Hitler's armies.
So by March of 1941, German armies were in occupation of Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria.
That still left Yugoslavia and Greece.
So long as they remained unoccupied territory, they remained the root for a possible Allied counter invasion.
At one of their regular meetings,
Hitler had assigned the job of conquering Greece to his stooge, Mussolini.
The stooge was delighted.
Here was his chance to prove to his people that he, too, was a conqueror.
But he was wrong.
Perhaps the uniforms fooled him.
Something did.
For after the fascist legions had blitzed on one cylinder this far into Greece, the Greeks, in a brilliantly conducted mountain campaign, drove the Italians back, and invaded Albania.
Hitler was enraged.
The failure of his stooge to protect his southern flank was delaying the attack on Russia.
He sent a final ultimatum.
For the Yugoslavs and Greeks, it was surrender or else.
But the Yugoslavs and
Greeks come from a long line of fighting men.
Nazi slavery didn't appeal to them.
At dawn on April 6th, German bombs told the Yugoslavians they were at war with Germany.
The Nazis and Italians launched a powerful and coordinated attack from all their bases, supported by virtually unopposed aerial bombarding.
The conclusion was inevitable.
Although resistance was determined, the Yugoslav army was cut up into many small segments, and captured.
The war in Greece also began on April 6th.
There, in spite of fierce and valiant resistance by the Greeks, and the British, who had come to their aid, the Germans, overwhelmingly superior in both numbers and equipment, forced their way past the Vistritza River,
Mount Olympus, the famous passage of Thermopylae, and by the end of April, a swastika flew over the ancient city of Athens.
The conquest of the
Balkans was now complete.
The whole force of Nazi might could now be turned loose on Russia.
There was no time to waste, for time was Russia's weapon.
Their industries, so recently built and which, like our own, were designed for the ways of peace, were converted for war.
Instead of steel for plows and tools, steel for shells and guns.
They knew their industry could never produce enough too adequately for the titanic struggle, but what they could produce, they would.
At the same, the army began to grow.
More and more men were called up to be trained, hardened, drilled, prepared to defend their land.
With the conquest of the Balkans, the Nazis had a solid front from the Black Sea to the Baltic but the Russians had built themselves a buffer, to take some of the steam out of the Nazi punch no matter where it landed, but where would it land?
When the blow came, it was from five different directions, and from the north, one extra, just for luck.
That was the big day.
As dawn broke, more than 200 Axis divisions, more than 2 million men plunged into a front
2000 miles long, reaching from the White Sea to the Black.
Their aim?
The annihilation of the Red Army, in the decisive battle on the frontier.
The offensive started along the whole length of the front, but was concentrated on three main objectives:
Leningrad, Moscow, and Kiev, the capital of the Ukraine.
In the first 30 days, von Leeb's forces drove to within 125 miles of Leningrad, while the Finns under Mannerheim, supported by the Germans, began to drive from the north to encircle the city.
In the center, von Bock's army plunged 480 miles into Soviet territory.
One Russian city after the other was overrun by the invaders.
And on July 17th, they captured the first main objective:
Smolensk, regarded as the key to Moscow.
Simultaneously in the south, von Rundstedt's forces cut deep into the Ukraine.
This was Blitzkrieg at its best.
The world gave Russia another six weeks, and the Germans issued a communique.
- The issue in the east has already been settled.
Smolensk is the last halt on the road to Moscow.
- But then, a strange thing happened.
For the first time since the mighty German army started its career of blitz, smashing into submission one European country after the other, that same German army came up against a country that did not submit.
Despite the fact that Hitler's army swept deeper and deeper into the Soviet Union, and by October the 15th stood practically within the shadows of the Kremlin, despite the fact that the Soviet government and all foreign missions were forced to move to Kuibyshev,
700 miles to the east, despite Hitler's triumphant pronouncement,
I can say that this enemy is already broken and will never rise again.
Despite the fact that by December,
500,000 square miles of Russian territory, an area equal to the entire middle western United States had fallen to the invaders, yes, despite Russia's loss of her best agricultural areas, her most thoroughly developed industrial plants, millions of her people, thousands of her tanks and her planes, despite everything, those six weeks had lengthened into nearly six months, and the dread Nazi blitz had spluttered, stumbled, and finally died.
What had happened here?
Let's try to analyze it.
First, in this titanic struggle, not only two armies, but two fighting methods and two strategies came face to face.
The German strategy was based on the well tried
'Keil and Kessel' or wedge and trap maneuver.
One wedge would be driven deep into the enemy territory, to hook up with another spearhead, driven through to meet it.
In the trap thus formed, the victim would be pocketed for annihilation.
The German plan in every campaign was to seek a decisive battle at the moment of invasion.
- A single blow must destroy the enemy, without regard for losses, a gigantic, all destroying blow.
- Remember the campaigns you have already seen in these films.
Poland, the Poles concentrated on their borders.
The blitz broke through.
18 days finished Poland.
France, the Allied strength on the borders, the breakthrough at Sedan, and the issue of France was settled.
The Balkans, the Yugoslavians rushed to the border, the breakthrough came and in
12 days, Yugoslavia was gone.
The Germans planned the same blitz against the Russians, but the Russians had developed their own strategy, one to take full advantage of the vast area of their land.
The Russian strategy was a defensive depth, line after line, far back into the interior, and when the Nazi wedge struck, the first line would bend with it, until it became part of the second.
Again, the wedge would strike, again, a segment would be lost, but again, the line would bend, until it became part of the third.
So the deeper the Germans plowed into Russian soil, the stronger their opposition, until finally, they faced an unshatterable wall, and were robbed of their chance to hit that all destroying blow they had counted on.
The result?
The Germans conquered land and lost the campaign.
For the Russian tactics kept the main bulk of their armies intact, and made a long war inevitable, instead of that quick decision the Germans sought.
And the Russians had other tactics that threw the Germans for a loss.
Germany had developed blitz warfare, mechanized warfare, armies on wheels, juggernauts to crush everything before them.
But the Russians found a way to drag them out of their traveling fortresses.
They used their cities as strongholds, and made the blitz come to them down alleys.
The more a city was bombed, the more impassable it became to the German Panzers.
They made the names of these Russian cities as familiar to us as the names of towns in the next county.
Rostov, Kharkov, Kiev, Kursk, Smolensk.
City after city, standing in the path of the Nazi blitz, the Red Army has found a way to make their cities of great strategic importance.
Odessa, the scene of a heroic siege of more than two months held up the whole Nazi thrust into the Crimea.
Sevastopol, which resisted every attempt of the Germans to break through.
Here, for eight and a half long months, the Russians fought for the town.
Inch by inch, barring the Germans from the great Black Sea naval base located there.
Finally, when the
Germans entered the town, each district was defended street by street.
Each street house by house and each house room by room.
The Russians knew their cities would be demolished, but their objective was not to save cities, but to destroy Germans, a high price to pay for a copy of Mein Kampf.
So the Germans were forced out of their armored shells, to fight and to die in the hand to hand combat they thought they had abolished.
There was another item the
Germans had overlooked.
They overlooked people, and generals may win campaigns, but people win wars, and on that fatal June 22nd, when the Russian people first learned of the invasion of their country, their grim faces told of their determination, to fight and to die, but never to surrender.
They knew this wasn't a question of who occupied what piece of land.
This was a question of life or death.
- This war is not an ordinary war.
It is the war of the entire Russian people, not only to eliminate the danger hanging over our heads, but to aid all people groaning under the yoke of fascism.
- So the alarm was spread to factory and farm, and from every Russian town and village, men poured forth to answer the call.
From now on, one thing mattered, and one thing only: victory.
Total war meant total mobilization, not war just for soldiers, war for everyone, young or old, male or female, it made no difference.
Age had nothing to do with it.
If you were only 12 years old, there was work for 12 year olds to do.
Sex had nothing to do with it.
If you could hold a rifle, you were a soldier.
If you could turn a lathe, you were a soldier.
If you could harvest the fields, you were a soldier.
If you could handle a locomotive, or pilot a ship, or guide a tractor, you were still a soldier.
For everything you did was part of that total war.
Nothing that the enemy could use was left behind, not a yard of wire, or a pound of iron, not an acre of wheat or a head of cattle, and the old men stood watch over the fields, ready to give the word to burn at the first sight of the enemy.
Scorched earth.
What can't be withdrawn must be destroyed.
That meant the factories, the plants, the oil depots, flames claimed them all.
The giant dam at Dneprostroi, into which had been poured not only steel and concrete, but five long years of Russian toil and Russian sweat, to yield the miracle of electricity to the farms and people of the Ukraine.
Now, rather than let the power it generated fall to the enemy, they destroyed it.
Scorched earth.
The land they had lived on, worked on, their forests, their fields, their farms, they surrendered them to the flames, but not to the invaders.
That was the scorched earth.
And for action behind the German lines, a new army was formed, an army without uniforms whose home was the forest, and whose front was the enemy's rear, the guerrilla army.
A minimum of glory, and a maximum of determination.
Their achievements were seldom recorded.
Look well at these faces.
You will never see them again in the ranks of war prisoners, or read their names over heroes' graves.
Ahead of them lay nothing but the rope and the halter, but they stayed behind and went on fighting.
Their only goal was merciless destruction, destruction of communication lines, supplies, the invaders themselves.
Their weapons were dynamite, and the terror of surprise.
They asked for no mercy, and they gave none.
This is the guerrilla army, this, the scorched earth, this, the Red Army, these, its leaders.
These are the reasons why although the Germans conquered land,
500,000 square miles of it, it was just land, barren land, scorched land.
These are the reasons why, after five and a half months of blitz warfare, after coming within sight of their goal, the Germans were stopped at the very gates of Moscow.
These are the reasons why although Hitler had sworn that before December, the swastika would fly from the Kremlin towers,
December had come, but it wasn't the swastika that flew over the Russian capital, and it wasn't the Nazi conquerors who marched through the streets of the ancient city.
But fresh reserves of the Red Army.
Causes and events leading up to our entry in the war,
Well what are the causes?.
Why are we Americans on the march?.
Is it because of...
..Pearl Harbour?.
Is that why we are fighting?.
Is it because of Britain?.
France?.
China?.
Czechoslovakia?.
Norway?.
Poland?.
Holland?.
Greece?.
Belgium?.
Yugoslavia?.
Russia?.
Just what was it that made us to change our way of living overnight?.
What turned our resources, our machines, our whole nation into one vast arsine?.
Producing more and more weapons of war, instead of the old materials of peace.
What put us into uniform, ready to engage the enemy on every continent?.
And every ocean?.
This is a fight between a free world and a slave world" Vice President Henry A. Wallace
What of these two worlds, or which Mr. Wallace spoke?.
The free and the slave?.
Let's take the free world first, our world.
How did it become free?.
Only through a long and unceasing struggle inspired by men of vision.
Moses
Thou shall not covet that which is they neighbours.
Mohammed
"Mankind is one community."
Confucius
"What you do not want done to yourself, so not do to others."
Christ
The truth shall make you free."
All believe in the sight of God, all men were created equal.
And from that there developed a spirit among men and nations, that is best expressed in our own declaration of freedom.
"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."
It is the corner-stone on which our nation was built.
And the ideal of all the great liberators.

Lighthouses!. Lighting up a dark and foggy world.
"Let government of the people, by the people for the people,
..shall not perish from the earth."
Fighting! Living! Dying! For what?.
For freedom! That for which man has fought, since time began.
To be free.
Is life so dear, or peace so sweet,
..as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery?.
Forbid itAlmighty God.
I know not what other course one may take, but as for me,
..give me liberty or give me death.
But what of this other world?.
Here men insisted that progress lay in killing freedom.
Here they were putting out the lighthouses, one by one.
Here the march of history was reversing itself.
In ltaly it began, when an ambitious rabble-rouser set his followers marching on Rome.
The country, like every other country after the last war,
..was torn by political unrest, hard times, unemployment.
Two courses were available to the ltalian people.
They could solve their problems in a free democratic way,
..or they could let someone else do the solving for them.
They made the tragic mistake of choosing the second course.
They put their faith and trust in this one man.
They believed they represented them.
Actually he planned to betray them, with the selfish interest of himself,
..and a group back of him.
Just as he had earlier betrayed those who first supported him.
In Germany another even more forceful demo go...
..set his marchers following from the Munich beer halls.
He too had the sinister opportunity..
..to take advantage of post-war chaos.
But he also had certain distinctive
German characteristics to play on.
To start with, the Germans have an in-born national love of regimentation and a harsh discipline.
He could give them that.
The German army, and through them the people, had never acknowledged...
..German defeat in the last war.
And were anxious for revenge.
That too, he promised them.
The wealthy and powerful industrialists were fearful of losing any of their wealth and power
And were ready to back anyone who would retain it for them.
He promised to take care of them too.
This man cunningly played all these ends against the middle.
And ruthlessly set out to murder the new-born German republic.
Here not one man, but a gang, disguised their little scheme...
..of the will of the Emperor. And to the Japanese people, the Emperor is God.
Taking advantage of their worship of the God-Emperor,
..it was no great trick to take away what little freedom they had ever known.
Yes in these lands, people surrendered their liberties and threw away their human dignity
They gave up their right as individual human beings.
They became a part of a mass, a human herd.
Although these countries were far apart and different in custom and language,
..the same poison made them much alike.
Each got a new uniform. In ltaly the bosses wore black shirts.
In Germany the shirts were brown.
In Japan they hid behind the uniform of the army.
But really they belonged to a sinister-secret society.
Their symbol was a black dragon.
The other fellows had to have a symbol too.
Germany a Swastika.
In ltaly, the old Roman symbol.
In Germany they called the new order.. National Socialism,
..or Nazism.
In ltaly, they had a shorter word:
Fascism.
In Japan they had lots of names for it.
The New Era of Enlightenment,
The New Order in Asia.
The Co-Prosperity Sphere.
But no matter how you slice it, it was just plain old-fashioned...
..materialistic imperialism.
The Japs would get the prosperity and the other would get the "co"-
They say trouble always comes in three's.
Take a good close look at this trio.
Remember these faces.
Remember them well. If you ever meet them, don't hesitate.
Stop thinking and follow me cried Hitler
I will make you masters of the world.
And the people answered, HElL!!
Stop thinking and believe in me, bellowed Mussolini and I will restore the glory that was ruined.
The people answered ll Duce! Il Duce!
Stop thinking and follow your God-Emperor cried the
Japanese War-Lords and Japan will rule the world.
And the people answered: Banzai! Banzai!
Each system was alike and that the constitutional law-making bodies gave up their power.
The Reichstag in Berlin.
The House of Deputies in Rome.
The Diet in Tokyo.
And these elected representatives, became collections of stooges.
Rubber stamp organizations.
Applauding on cue, the words of the leaders.
Each system did away with free-speech, and free-assembly.
Each system did away with free-press and substituted a press controlled by the party
Through their ministry of propaganda, each took complete control of theatre,
..the movies, the radio. Every cultural activity in every channel of information,
..was controlled by the most important members of the party.
Each did away with free courts, and trail by jury.
And substituted courts and judges, run by the party.
Each abolished labour unions, and the rights of bargaining for wages.
And under the pretext of patriotism, established the system of forced labour
Each enforced its decrees, by an army of secret police, who held the power of life and death,
..over every individual.
And for the few who still believed in freedom and said so, there was a ready answer.
"Only the application of force used continuously and ruthlessly can bring about the decision...
..in favour of the side it supports."
"Mein Kampf" -Page 189 German Edition
"The greatest intellect in the world, can be silenced with this."
That is an exact translation of the words these black-shirts cheer so lustily.
"Whenever I hear anyone mention the word culture, the first thing I do is reach for my gun."
Yes, they had the answers, the black-jack and the gun.
In ltaly they did it differently.
While in Japan.
To their names, can be added hundreds of thousands of others
..who stood in the way of the new order
Finally there is only one obstacle left,
I am the Light of the World, he that follow me shall not walk in darkness, but have the light of hope.
The word of God and the word of purists can not be reconciled.
THEN GOD MUST GO!!
"l am absolutely clear in my own mind, and I think l can speak for the Führer as well.
That both the Catholic and Protestant churches must banish from the life of our people."
Thus spoke Dr. Alfred Rosenberg and if you had any doubt he spoke for his Führer
..here's what happened.
"The Christian cross is to be removed from all churches and cathedrals and to be replaced...
..by the immortal symbol of Germany the swastika."
Berlin, 1935 700,000 members of the Protestant
Youth organizations were forced to disband.
Thousands of other men of God,
Protestant, Catholic, Jewish,
..wee persecuted, arrested and confined in concentration camps.
"Our Führer is the intermediary between his people and the throne of God.
Everything the Führer utters, is religion in the highest sense.
It is only on one or two exceptional points that Christ and Hitler stand on comparison,
..for Hitler is far too big a man to be compared with one so petty."
Everyday in all German classrooms,
"Adolf Hitler is our savoir our hero"
"He is the noblest being in the whole wide world."
"For Hitler we live."
"For Hitler we die."
"Our Hitler is our Lord."
"Who rules a brave new world."
Yes take children from the faith of their fathers, and teach them that the state is the only church.
And the head of the State, is the voice of God.
"l want to see again, in the eyes of the youth, the gleam of the beast of prey" --Hitler
That was the way of life, or better, the way of death in that other world.
Now what of our world?.
What did we want?.
What did we do about it?.
First of all, we wanted peace and security.
And to prove our sincerity, in 1921 we initiated the Washington Disarmament Conference.
This resulted in two vitally important treaties.
One, to reduce the size of the British,
Japanese, French, ltalian andAmerican Fleets.
And the other, the Nine-Power Treaty, which guaranteed the integrity of China,
And incidentally, one of the powers signing this was Japan.
Later on in 1 929, we signed the Kellog-Briand Pact...
..which was suppose to abolish wars in a means of settling international disputes.
This pact was signed by 47 nations, including Germany and Japan.
"Mr. President, I have the honour of handing you the London NavalTreaty."
Faithful to our treaty obligations,
..we scraped more than 60% of our Naval tonnage.
And our Army was reduced to a standing force of 136,000 men.
Smaller than that maintained by Romania.
We let our hopes for peace become so strong, that they grew into determination...
..not to fight unless directly attacked.
We let ourselves be influenced by those who said we could find...
..security through isolation.
The confusion in our way of thinking is apparent.
In the slice of public opinion, as it appeared in Athe News in 1939.
"Another war?. Not for me. This time
America should keep out, and I know I will."
"lf war breaks out in Europe, I think this country should heed the advice of the First President,
..and avoid all foreign entanglements"
I haven't the slightest idea of European affairs."
In the event of war in Europe, I think we should stay out of it entirely
And all our efforts should be made to keep out of the fight.!
Let Europe fight their own battles.
They mean nothing to us."
We should mind out own business.
-By all means, NO."
Yes, fight.... NO.... NO.. Yes"
If my country calls, YES."
"-NO!"
We simply did not want to understand that our individual and national problems were...
..and always will be dependant upon the problems of the whole world.
And we had individual and national problems to worry about. Plenty of them.
Just as Germany, ltaly and Japan had, but we faced it in a democratic way.
We passed laws to give working men a chance to improve their lot.
We established an insurance program for those without jobs.
It began to give old folks protection against want and hunger
We organized the C.C.C. to provide our young men with healthy and useful employment.
A Federal works program came into being and changed the face of our nation with new roads,
..bridges, schools.
It built great new dams that brought electricity of millions of our people.
These were some of our accomplishments, but there were others, not so credible.
We turned our backs on the League of Nations.
We passed theTariff Act to
..to set a higher wall of isolation around us.
We encouraged lawlessness with the farce of prohibition.
But in spite of these mistakes, we never had a thought of losing our free institutions.
John Q. Public still ran the country
He had his choice of voting for Dewey,
Wilke, Roosevelt or anybody else.
In Germany they had the choice of voting for Hitler, Hitler, or Hitler.
Over here, John Q. still read what he pleased.
And although he heard of books being burned in other countries,
..he would have laughed, if anybody told him his books would be burned.
And on Sunday, if he felt like it,
John Q. went to any church he pleased.
Most of all, he got a kick out of seeing his kids grow up.
The average American was quite unconscious of the fact that some people,
..had this in mind for the little John Q's
"To die for the Emperor is to live forever."
Japanese Army Slogan
"Three cheers for war, noble and beautiful above all." --Mussolini
Yes, while their children were being trained to kill,
..John Q. 's kids were giving their pennies to help them have life.
And when we saw these men on the news reels, quite often we laughed.
To us they looked like characters in a musical comedy.
But they weren't comic, they weren't funny, they were deadly serious.
They were out for world conquest.
And what made it deadly serious was, they were 70 million Japanese,
45 million ltalians, and 80 million Germans, all hopped up with the same idea.
Their leaders told them that they were supermen.
Herren Folk" the Nazi called it, the Master Race.
Destined to rule all other peoples on earth.
Take a good look at these humourless men.
These were to be the rulers of the ruling race.
Bear us blindly and you will obtain your rightful place in the world.
All other people will be your slaves.
That's what they promised them.
ThatAmericans, Chinese,
..Russians, SouthAmericans, all free peoples would work for them and make them rich.
And how they ate it up!
We shall restore the glory that was Rome.
Today we rule Germany.
Tomorrow the world.
The Pacific is ours!
It was inevitable that these countries should gang up on us.
The little fellow is our pal,
Kurusu
Who smiled his way into our hearts in December, 1941.
Here he and his friends are busy carving up the world in advance.
Staking out their claims.
Take a good look at these claims.
Here is the ltaly that Mussolini took over in 1922.
And almost his first act was to tell the ltalians they were the rightful...
.. owners of Corsica, Nice, Savoien,
Albania,
Tunisia, Ethiopia, and a land corridor linking it with Libya.
Later on he had an even bigger dream,
..the Old Roman Empire as it existed nearly 2000 years ago.
To dominate all the lands joining the Mediterranean.
Mare Nostrum, Our Sea they called it, just as the ancient Romans did.
As for the Japanese, they had some ambitions too.
By 1920, they had grabbed of Formosa, Korea and the southern half of the island of Sakhalin.
Then Baron Giichi Tanaka, the Prime Minister,
..carefully set down Japanese aims in a document called theTanaka Memorial.
It was presented to the Emperor on July 25, 1927.
In order to conquer the world, we must first conquer China.
Here was their dream.
Manchuria for raw materials.
China for manpower. Then a triumphant
March through lndo China...
..Siam, Burma, lndia, the East lndia,
..and on throughAustralia and New Zealand.
In the north, all they claimed was that part of Russia east of Lake Baikal.
That was to be the new order inAsia.
Then the Japs would move eastward to crush the United States.
And really start the Co-Prosperity Sphere.
Now take a look at the bite the Nazis reserved for themselves.
Here's the Germany Hitler walked into and here's what he wanted.
First Europe under his complete political and economic control.
Leaving Mussolini a share of the loot, if he behaved himself.
Then a drive to the east, through the rich oil lands of lran and lraq and into lndia.
Another push south, throughAfrica.
Then from Dakar, jump off to meet the Honorary Arians...
..who were to move in on SouthAmerica through the Pacific.
At the same time, start across the Scandinavian countries.
To hook up with his buck-toothed pals coming over from Siberia,
..to join in the conquest of the United States.
There it is gents.
All they left us was Shangri-La.
And they'd claim that too, if they knew where it was.
And did they think they had a chance?.
Listen.........
"When war comes between Japan and the
United States, I shall not be content...
..to occupy Guam, The Philippines,
Hawaii and San Francisco."
I look forward to debating the peace to the
United States in the White House in Washington."
Yamamoto wrote those words of January, 1941.
Yes the conquering Jap army down Pennsylvania
Avenue.
That was the final goal. You will see what they did to the man and women...
..of Mankind, Hong Kong and Manila.
I imagine the field day they would have enjoyed if they'd marched through the streets of Washington?.
But before striking, a preliminary step was necessary.
..From Berlin...
..From Rome...
.. From Tokyo, the Champaign started.
Propaganda, to confuse, divide, soften up their intended victims.
Put them on the defensive.
Put them on the defensive.
Scream your abuse!
Shout you're oppressed!
The World is wrong. You are right!
If you shriek it loud enough and often enough, they'll believe you.
Above all, use their free speech and their free press to destroy them.
Lebensraum" they demanded.
Living room!
Our lands are over-crowded and at the same time, they gave prizes to mothers,
..who bore the most sons.
They brought together large groups of young men and young girls for human breeding.
Read what one of their leaders wrote:
"Round up a thousand German girls. Isolate them in a camp. Then let them be joined by a hundred...
..German men. If a hundred such camps were set up, you would have 100,000 thoroughbred children in one stroke."
--Dr. Williband Hentschel
Of course the children from this assembly line, belonged to the state...
..to be scientifically trained for conquest.
Another howl, was lack of raw materials.
They claimed they were the ""have-nots"" and we were the "haves."
But out of this supposed lack, they built up the greatest war machines...
..the world has ever known.
These are the published figures from the German Military budget.
Actually between 1933, and 1939
Hitler's program of re-armament cost more than 80 billion dollars.
The Nazis alone assembled a striking force of...
..30 Panzer divisions,
70 motorized divisions,
1 40 infantry divisions, plus the Luftwaffe, the world's largest air force.
And they had no raw materials.
Think of the bread the automobiles, the good things of life the German, ltalian, Japanese leaders...
..might have given their people, if they had spent this money for peace,
..instead of war.
You know what billions we are now spending to match their military force.
No, no these arguments were all smoke screens.
When war came, the democracies proved to be the "have-nots."
And our enemies the "haves."
And when war came, where did it come?.
Remember that date, September 18, 1941.
A date we should remember as well as
December 7, 1941.
For on that date, in 1 931...
..the war we are now fighting began.
The place was Manchuria, the northern most Province of China,
..6000 miles from San Francisco.
Manchuria the first objective in the Tanaka plan.
By September 18th, the Japanese, who by treaty patrolled...
..the southern Manchuria railway, had secretly and illegally increased their garrison.
On the Korean/Manchuria border an entire
Japanese army was assembled,
..conveniently equipped for a winter campaign.
All they needed was an excuse.
They made their own.
At 10:30 that night, just after the Mukden Express passed by,
..a section of track was dynamited, causing damage to one rail and two fish-plates.
Japan's honour had violated.
In half an hour, the Japanese railroad garrison launched a co-ordinated attack, on the barracks for the sleeping Chinese army at Mukden.
The slaughter was appalling.
By midnight, the conveniently placed Japanese army,
..poured across the Korean border and the first open act of aggression...
..the invasion of Manchuria was on.
In four days they had occupied the whole of southern Manchuria.
And shortly after, the whole country.
Manchuria became Manchukuo a puppet state with an obedient stooge on the throne.
Henry Pu Yi.
A weakling, whom the Japanese had prepared for the job...
..was seven years of women and song.
In Washington, Henry L. Simson, then Secretary of State.
..was now Secretary of War,
..sent out a blistering denunciation of the attack.
The League of Nations sent a committee of five, headed by Lord Litton and...
..including our General Frank McCoy to investigate.
In October of 1932,
..the Committee issued its report.
"We found that the occupation of this large part of China,
..was not justified on the grounds of self-defence,
..and that the new State which had been set up, is Japanese projected...
..rather than a genuine case of
Manchurian self-determination."
Shortly after, The League condemned
Japan as an aggressor Nation.
It is a matter of common knowledge, that Japan's policy...
..is fundamentally inspired by a genuine desire...
..to guarantee peace in the Far East.
And to contribute to the maintenance of peace throughout the world.
Japan, however finds it impossible to accept...
..that it fought abducted by the assembly."
In answer, the Japanese delegates, knowing there were no guns behind this condemnation,
..smiled, took up their briefcases, marched out ofThe League.
Northern Manchuria was dead.
Collective security was dead.
The green light had been given to the aggressors.
We and the rest of the world knew that these aggressors should be stopped and punished,
..but we were unwilling to make the necessary sacrifices to back up that opinion.
It was impossible to convince a farm-boy in lowa, or a driver of a London bus,
..or a waiter in a Paris cafe that he should go to war,
..because of a mud hut in Manchuria.
Yet the subsequent course of history makes it clear that...
..that incident so many miles away is the reason...
..that you and millions of others are in uniform today.
The Japs had Manchuria, phase number one of theTanaka plan was completed.
Phase number 2, the conquest of China.
In 1932, without warning the Japs attacked the city of Shanghai.
Here they met such stubborn resistance, that they had to pour more than 75,000 troops...
..into the local battle, before capturing the city.
This resistance, made them decide to shift their campaign into the north.
And in 1933, they added the
Province of Jerold to Manchuria.
Yes, the Japs launched the second phase of theTanaka plan.
But they had yet to finish it.
A United Nations stands against them.
Under the inspired leadership of
General Chiang Kai-shek.
The Chinese people fought and still fight on.
Meantime, what of Japan's partners?.
What helpless people were they planning to bomb,
..drive into slavery?.
Hitler was not yet ready.
But Mussolini was. Mussolini had to be.
His people were growing restless.
Fascism hadn't produced the heaven on earth that he promised them.
So he pulled the old trick of launching a foreign war to divert the attention from troubles at home.
So Mussolini beat his chest likeTarzan and looked around for a worthy foe.
He found one. Ethiopia.
Good country for the beginning of a glorious empire.
Its army had no machine guns. Its army had no tanks.
Its army did have an air force.
Exactly one old aeroplane.
One aeroplane against the nation which had developed the theory of total air-war.
Of the blitz that would wipe out cities, destroy civilians.
Man woman, and child.
In October of 1935, following the Japanese example,
..an incident was provoked at the little settlement of Wal Wal near the border of Ethiopia...
..and ltalian Somalia land.
Italy's honour had been violated.
Refusing any arbitration, Mussolini moved the whole might of his army through...
..the Suez Canal, to overrun the undefended country
Ethiopia's Emperor, Haile Selaissie, appeared beforeThe League of Nations.
"l must still fight on until my tardy allies appear...
..and if they never come,
I say to you without bitterness,
..the West will perish."
Members of the League, half-heartedly stopped trading with ltaly.
But refused the only thing that would stop any aggressor
..force!
Ethiopia was left to herself.
Native leaders came to pledge their allegiance.
The people of Ethiopia, with their spears and bare hands,
..faced the guns and tanks of the invaders.
Fighting desperately and gallantly to save their country from conquest.
They fought and they died. But in the end, there could only be one result,
..might triumphed.
Italy conquered Ethiopia.
Many of our elected leaders warned us of danger,
.."Without declaration of war, and without warning or justification of any kind,
..civilians, including vast numbers of women and children,
..are being ruthlessly murdered with bombs from the air."
But we were still hypnotized by the fact, that two broad oceans stood between us...
..and the rest of the world.
We didn't realize that when the time was months to span these oceans, was ended.
That the steam ship had cut these months to days.
And that now the whole earth's surface could be covered in the space of hours.
Yes, we were a nation that wanted peace,
..but we hadn't yet learned that peace for us, depends on peace for all.
No one would run the risk of war for some mud huts and barren plains in Ethiopia,
..any more than we would run the risk for some similar huts and plains in Manchuria.
Correctly interpreting our attitude, the aggressors were all assure they could get what they wanted.
Japan had started on her march of conquest.
Italy had begun her new Empire.
And now the third gangster
What about him?.
We take him up in our next film.
And show how he joined his partners and put in his bid.
For this is what we are fighting.
Freedom's oldest enemy.
The passion of the few to rule the many
This isn't just a war. This is common man's life and death's...
..struggle against those who would put him back into slavery.
We lose it and we lose everything.
Our homes. The jobs we want to go back to.
The books we read. The very food we eat.
The hopes we have for our kids.
The kids themselves.
They won't be ours anymore.
That's what's at stake.
It's us or them!
The chips are down. Two worlds stand against each other.
One must die, one must live.
170 years of freedom, decrees our answer!
"Victory of the democracies can only be complete with the utter defeat of the...
..war machines of Germany and Japan."

The land is at peace under the Tokugawa shogunate.
March 14,1701...
Tsunayoshi is the 5th shogun.
Kajikawa.
You must thank the Imperial messengers... for Lady Tokugawa.
Why not ask me what to say?
What does Lord Asano know?
I have been
Master of Ceremonies... over 40 years.
Why did you ask...
Lord Asano?
Reception Committee member... in name only.
I doubt he can... carry out... his various functions.
Former lords carried out... their assignments.
There was no one so ignorant... or so rude.
This is the final day... of the ceremonies.
The messengers have arrived.
After the shogun... receives them...
I will tell you.
Kira, vengeance!
I am on duty here.
Withdraw your hands.
A screen in the Palm Room.
Lord Asano... take off your outer ceremonial robe.
We have been sent to question you...
About today's incident...
I speak as an official now.
You forgot where you were today... and attacked Kira. Your reason?
I'm sorry. I have no eXcuse.
I bear no ill will toward the shogun.
I forgot myself over a private grudge... and wounded Kira.
Did you intend to kill him?
My sword missed killing him.
I regret it.
Mete out my punishment.
A private grudge?
I have nothing to say.
I only regret I failed to kill Kira.
A slight wound.
Please laugh at my lack of skill.
Please punish me according to the law.
No, of course not.
I did nothing to have him bear a grudge.
That noise? Asano is coming!
Be careful!
It is hard to believe.
Such violence.
I can only think that
Asano is mentally deranged!
Did you touch your sword?
Do you believe I did?
I am Master of Ceremonies and in the castle... and this is an important day.
So I tried to avoid his sword as best I could.
That is why I was wounded from behind.
Very admirable of you.
Thank you for your words of praise.
My orders?
Very well done.
When my lord left... he seemed pale... so I asked him... to return early.
He smiled sadly... and said his worries... end today.
He will return soon.
We must cheer him up.
You understand?
A word, Lady Asano.
Vassals Horibe and Kataoka... are here.
What is it?
Today in the Pine Corridor... our lord wounded Kozuke Kira.
Your questionings...
We reported it to the Elders in detail.
Kira, mindful of place, was lauded for not fighting.
Dr. Yoshida will give him medicine.
Dr. Kurizaki will treat his wound.
He can recuperate fully.
He can leave the castle with attendants.
Lord Asano... to gratify a personal grudge... he dared attack Kira in the castle.
So he will commit hara-kiri in Lord Tamura's custody.
Please wait.
Please give us time to think over your order.
I wish to eXpress my opinion.
I agree to sending him to Lord Tamura.
But please reconsider the other point.
What?
As we have mentioned before...
Lord Asano's behavior has been of the best.
He cherished no ill will towards the shogun.
A true samurai, he admitted it was a personal grudge.
A great daimyo to be put into custody... and to be ordered to commit hara-kiri at once is too much.
As superintendent and inquisitor...
I believe the judgment... is unfair.
Unfair?
Lord Asano sacrificed family honor.
He was driven beyond human endurance.
Kira must have been at fault too.
Please use the samurai code in passing judgment.
The shogun praised Kira for his good behavior.
He did not even... touch his sword.
What a world when such petty things are praised!
Wounded, all he could do was to run and fuss.
Too weak to draw his sword.
But I was wrong to call him a coward.
He was in the castle... and near the shogun's chambers.
But a man like Kira...
We samurai would not call him our equal.
Family and fief are first with him.
Losing the samurai spirit, he only thinks of profits.
It has been decided Lord Asano became demented... and resorted to violence.
I, Tamon, cannot easily agree to that.
It is only fair to inquire further.
You have a point in what you say.
But Lord Yanagisawa knows.
And it has been decided already.
We'll keep your request in mind though.
Please wait.
If Lord Yanagisawa decided it.
I must speak up.
In short, Lord Yanagisawa is Kira's distant kin.
It shows prejudice.
An affront to daimyo, not hereditary lords.
Request his reconsideration.
You go too far.
It can't be changed.
The more reason a fair judgment the first time.
If not, try until a fair one is reached.
Administrators decide it!
You've no voice in it!
Insist and you'll regret it!
I beg you!
I say it out of loyalty.
Announce me to Lord Mino.
No! Your position is too low!
Please announce me!
No! No!
Please announce me!
Chamberlain.
A word from Councilor Kofu.
These are peaceful times.
The samurai are becoming laX.
But your conduct was that of a true samurai.
"I will not forget it."
These are his words.
You gave him leave to bid his Lord Asano farewell.
So I told Gengoyemon Kataoka.
He said he would be forever grateful to you.
I am overwhelmed.
I feel for Lord Asano's vassals.
I'm glad you came.
Kiyo, preparations.
Kiyo.
The time our lord at Lord Tamura's mansion...
Stop it!
Would your death please our lord?
Kira was not even reprimanded.
Lord Uesugi backs him.
We can't avenge...
Fool!
Tomimori.
What is it?
Magistrate's men came.
What about?
As previously stated... the Asano Edo Mansion will be confiscated.
So Lord Asano's vassals... must leave at once.
The Asano Clan Castle at Ako...
42 miles from Edo.
News reaches Ako of Lord Asano's attack on Kira.
Another mistake.
Why the rush?
Confiscating the castle?
Our lord?
That courier's message was vague.
Does Chamberlain Oishi know?
Why check?
Our lord?
You tell me.
Our work is to carry out the chamberlain's orders.
Forward of me, perhaps, but hasn't Oishi lost his head?
The worst possible news but he does nothing.
Instead, he's calculating.
It's beneath a samurai.
Is he a fit chamberlain?
We have many doubts too.
Yasoyemon Okajima.
Yes?
Who told you to count the castle silver?
I am in charge.
I have my orders from Chamberlain Oishi.
Yasoyemon... Yasoyemon.
How can you count money... after hearing the bad news?
Oishi isn't Lord Asano's only vassal.
Others of high rank too.
He would not resort to such a thing.
I asked him to do it.
Thank you. How much?
The details are here.
About 900 kan, I believe.
900 kan?
It'll buy more than
20,000 koku of rice.
More than I had eXpected.
There was so much silver in the castle?
And how much gold?
000 ryo.
000 ryo?
Yasoyemon, what do you think?
Rate of eXchange?
Chamberlain, the Asano clan faces a crisis.
Your important duty's to calm the people.
True.
But if we must leave... the most pressing need is money.
Before we think of ourselves... we must look after the people in the Asano domain.
It's our duty to our lord.
No, that is of secondary importance.
Think first of our quotas.
No.
The four Ako counties bolster us.
It is not the other way around.
The Ako farmers and shop people must bear no losses.
You're a chamberlain in charge of it. Help me.
Your pardon.
The second courier's arriving soon.
Know who he is?
Hara and Oishi, I think.
Hara came himself?
Why are you here at your age?
Edo Chamberlain Yasui's missive to you.
Hara-kiri that very day?
The shogunate showed no mercy.
Our Lord's dwellings were confiscated the same day.
The ceremonies for the Imperial messengers?
Were they postponed?
No, only a change in place.
Everything went as arranged.
It went smoothly?
I am grateful.
I am very grateful... for that.
What about Kira?
Not even reprimanded.
He wasn't?
Our Lord was hot-tempered... but it was too cruel a punishment.
The verdict?
I'd like to know the reason.
Here is it.
Read it.
"Lord Asano.
"Holding a personal grudge...
"against Kira...
"you forgot time and place, daring to..."
Wait.
"Daring to"?
Yes. "Daring to wound Kira.
"It was an unpardonable act.
"So you are ordered to commit hara-kiri."
Is that all?
Yes.
Have you our lord's last words?
Yes.
"I meant to let you know...
"but do not have the time.
"Reading this must puzzle you."
"Reading this must puzzle you"?
Is that all?
Yes.
Reading this must puzzle you.
Reading this must puzzle you.
His last poem?
Here it is.
"More frail than petals...
"scattered by the wind...
"I bid a last farewell and leave spring behind."
"More frail than petals...
"scattered by the wind...
"I bid a last farewell and leave spring behind."
Yesterday, it was to die... holding the castle.
Today, hara-kiri for their lord... no decision's reached.
Chamberlain Ono wants... to make Lord Daigaku the heir... and turn over the castle... peacefully.
Loyal men... like vassals Okajima and Takebayashi.
They watch him as a betrayer.
How will Chamberlain Oishi unify such difference?
Brother said he's going to the castle... to commit hara-kiri.
Is it true?
Are you still awake?
It's late. Go to bed.
Sugi, are you there?
The children.
I'm not sleepy!
Are Father and Brother following our lord?
I can't sleep.
A samurai's son must be calm.
It is most true at important times.
Forget your father's words?
No. Good night, Mother.
Good night, Aunt.
Chamberlain Oishi and I... are cousins.
It's forward of me to say this.
But all the vassals are waiting for his decision.
Ushioda, my husband, too.
He doesn't say anything.
So I don't know.
I can only say... he seems to be torturing himself... in waiting for some news.
I think he'll make up his mind by it.
Important news?
I don't know what it is myself.
Retainer Onodera in Kyoto... came by sedan.
From Kyoto?
When did you know?
Notified on the 18th... by the shogunate.
Any gossip in Kyoto?
I've something to report to our lord's grave... and comfort his soul.
I called on Chief Councillor... and other lords... and apologized to them... for what our lord did.
Representing Asano clan...
I fell down.
And told them I represent... all the vassals.
I apologized and apologized.
Just as you told me to... beforehand.
They all said... they all feel sorry... for our lord.
We know how you feel.
I was overwhelmed.
They don't hate what our lord did?
There's more of it.
It's unbelievable but... rumor says... the Emperor said to those close to him... that he is sorry... our lord failed to kill Lord Kira.
What our lord did this time...
It is an ineXcusable crime.
There was a reason, but... our lord was rude.
He's deserved to be called a blasphemer.
But the rumor I heard...
And sympathy from nobles...
I, Kuranosuke...
I'm saved.
I don't mind other things.
Our lord's house or fief.
If he's branded as a blasphemer...
Our lord can't rest in peace forever.
Same to us.
We'll be unable to find a place to stay in Japan.
How seriously we think of revenge.
We couldn't avenge our lord.
You said you feel sorry for our lord.
I'm saved.
You return to Kyoto.
Sit down outside the palace.
And eXpress feelings... of gratitude.
For our lord and all of us.
You do that.
I will.
When did you come?
We came too.
Return to Edo.
Why?
They're all cowards here.
We wasted our time.
Oishi?
Coward too.
We'll avenge our lord.
On our own.
What you said makes sense.
But we must unite together.
Make up your mind... after the meet.
No need to.
Wait.
Chuzaemon.
You're Chamberlain's right-hand man.
Why does he want to restore the House?
Is it true?
Tell us!
He's thinking it over.
No time to!
You know why we came in a hurry?
You don't feel sorry for our lord?
I do.
Decide then!
You intend to give up the castle meekly?
It's up to the meet.
I can't say it now.
We're from Edo, so you don't trust us?
It's not true.
We've two different opinions yet.
The shogunate sent its army.
They'll arrive... the day after tomorrow.
Yet, no decision?
No.
You came here ahead of us.
What did you do?
We thought... you'd make the shogunate's unfairness to the public.
We were glad.
And now...
I know it.
Wait awhile.
It's not that easy.
There's a reason.
For your own?
You go too far!
Look.
They've short swords.
They've families but they came here... ready to die.
We're equally loyal... not only you.
Hara-kiri won't comfort our lord.
People will laugh.
I'm veXed at it.
Lord Kira's hired
150 retainers... to guard his house.
What for?
When we walk in Edo... people seem to believe us to avenge our lord.
We don't know how you feel.
But we must do it.
I know.
But Chamberlain's to decide it.
Don't bother him.
Trust Chamberlain and wait.
No, I can't!
We're here.
But he changes his mind too often. I can't trust him.
What is it?
Nothing.
But you're worn out.
You too.
Don't worry too much.
You came.
Why so formal?
Depending on today's meet... we may never see you again.
Father, Tokubei Izeki came.
He did?
Is he well?
So he came?
He's shouting at the porch... that he'd go to the castle if you don't.
He's willful.
We've enjoyed quarrels since we were kids.
Talking ill of me?
He said you must be scared... and need a stimulant.
He gave me medicine.
It's like him.
You can't go to the castle?
I can't very well go there without fighting with him.
Kinai.
Tokubei.
Remember my face?
You left here.
Why did you come back?
Why? I can't ignore the crisis of the Asano house!
Go away.
There's no Asano house now.
Not going to hold the castle?
You're a fief-thief!
You're in charge of it... and won't fight!
I'll decide it.
After the meet ends today.
What?
I won't take orders from you!
You...
You're his heir?
Yes.
Monzaemon.
Age?
I'm 14.
Your hair?
On my way here...
I made it like an adult's.
I'll die for the Asanos.
My father taught me so.
Let us enter the castle.
Father's been loyal to Lord Asano until now.
Very brave of you but I won't.
I won't let you enter.
Go home... and live your own life.
Kinai!
I'm talking to your son.
You kindly came here today.
I appreciate it indeed.
But even if we hold the castle...
I won't ask jobless samurai to help us.
You're jobless, too, since you were eXpelled.
It'll be a disgrace to us.
But...
Think over what I said to you carefully, Monza.
I'll go with you.
No!
I will!
No!
I will!
No!
Chamberlain!
You came from Edo too?
I'd like to ask you a question.
Lord Kira's wound's been healed.
Trying to restore the house?
Real intention?
Intention?
You don't like my plan to restore the Asano house.
Our lord's short temper caused this.
Restoring his house is loyalty too.
It's not loyalty, never!
Our lord wasn't insane!
He knew his house would be abolished.
But he couldn't bear it.
So he did it.
It's our duty... to wreak his grudge... against Lord Kira.
Our lord regretted... he failed... to kill Kira.
And he wept.
How'd you take it for?
Even if the house is restored... we can't face people.
Only way for us is to kill Lord Kira.
I'm against your plan!
Even if all Japan were given to us...
I hate to spare Kira's life!
Tell us your intention.
I cannot, now.
What?
There are many different... opinions among retainers.
So I can't tell mine now.
Promise me... that you follow my decision unconditionally.
Through?
They all signed it with blood.
Number?
51 vassals.
Only 51 vassals who'll decide the fate of the house?
You sign with blood too.
For Chamberlain.
I'll do it later.
Yasubei.
Later.
Juroza.
I'll return to Edo, so I won't do it.
Magodayu.
I don't agree.
Gengo.
No.
Matsunojo, Chamberlain's son...
He's dead by now.
I'm a samurai's son too.
I wish to enter the castle... and die like a man.
You're unlucky to be a son of this foolish father.
Even if you cry...
I can't be reborn to be wise.
You're plain unlucky.
Resign to your fate.
Time to give up the castle... is close at hand.
And many vassals have run from here.
Those who are ready to die among 300 retainers... are only about 50 now.
You're all loyal men.
I didn't tell you anything... and asked you to sign with blood.
I had to be doubly sure.
Now, I want to ask you the impossible again.
Please listen to me.
I want you to leave here.
As of now.
And go to Enrin-ji Temple.
Don't criticize the shogunate.
Close your mouth hereafter.
Please trust your lives to me.
It looks difficult but easy to hold the castle.
All we have to do is... fight against the shogunate and die.
But give it up and avenge our lord...
It looks easy but very difficult.
It requires determination.
I intend... to choose the latter.
It's a hard way... to take.
How about it?
Please tell me.
A question.
Wherever we are... we want to avenge our lord.
Can we?
Of course.
As we remember our lord... we can't forget
Lord Kira is alive.
We can't let him live on.
I'll join you!
Please let me sign with blood!
Me too!
I will!
Let me sign too!
We'll follow your instructions.
We trust our lives to you.
So you'll leave everything to me?
Very well. We'll wait for the right time to come.
Leave here quietly.
But we served here for many years.
Paintings are trees.
We loved them all.
This is our last chance... to look at them.
Bid them farewell.
You hasty man!
Killing your son too! A fool!
I admit I'm a hasty man!
A fool!
But please tell me clearly I was wrong.
Since you came out alive...
You must have a plan.
I know you aim high deep in your mind.
Remember, we were childhood friends.
Tell me your real intention.
You shine all the more when you're in trouble.
I know you won't back out.
I know it.
For my son's sake too, please tell me.
The shogunate favors Lord Kira.
If we kill him... it means we accuse its unfairness...
And criticize it... to the public.
Hurry, or I will be unable to hear you.
I intend to resist the shogunate administration.
Good! I'll go ahead of you.
Avenge our lord for me.
I'll join you later, Tokubei.
Hurry and come.
I will be waiting for you,
Kuranosuke.
Oishi's Home In Yamashina
Oishi Lives In Seclusion Here
Thank you for everything.
I'm sorry he did not come home.
Thank you for letting us eat our fill.
But we want Chamberlain to eXplain to our fill too.
We came here representing others.
I don't know where he is.
But we must see him before we return to Edo.
He deceived us.
It's our fault to be deceived too.
We'll talk it over.
We may never see you again.
Please be strong.
Mother,
I'll take them to Father.
Please do that.
Have you made up your mind?
I may be importunate... but as your real father says... leave this house... and return to your own home in Tajima.
I came for you from Tajima.
Your husband didn't return for three days from Kyoto.
I know what he really is now.
I started to serve your house when you were born.
And saw you grow up.
When you married into his house...
I handled everything too.
I can't leave you as it is.
I'll follow you back to Tajima.
Please take your children.
You can feel free to leave them.
As long as he is alive...
I won't leave him.
People may criticize him.
But I trust him as his wife.
And walk the same road of his.
He's living a gay life alone.
He forgets you... and loyalty.
I know him best... as his wife.
His real self nobody else knows of.
If you ask me... he's not rotten to the core.
There's some reason he's suffering to death.
And for that reason he's pretending to be like that.
He doesn't tell me... but I can feel it.
And I want to share the pain with him.
Please don't ever say it again.
I want you to tell my father... what I've just said.
He's with Majordomo Endo, the Emperor's advisor.
So wait here for a while.
While we suffer dire poverty... he enjoys his life.
No wonder he hates to stake his life.
Well, well,I'm glad you came.
It's nice of you.
Kuranosuke.
Make up your mind.
Serve Emperor's
Chief Advisor Konoe.
You should realize he's serious about you by now.
I'm overwhelmed, but as I told you many times before...
I can't face my late lord... if I serve Advisor Konoe so soon.
Please don't press me for a while.
Girls, bring sake!
We'll have a party!
Stay away, girls.
The reason you don't agree with me...
Is it restoration of the Asano house?
Advisor Konoe told me today... he'll help you restore the Asano clan... through Lord Tsunatoyo in Kofu.
I'll go to Edo for it.
To Edo?
Yes.
As you know, Lord Tsunatoyo will enter Edo Castle... and become the 6th shogun.
It's easy for him to do it.
We're relatives.
So I don't want to see you being jobless.
Besides, my master wants to hire you.
That's why I'm going to Edo.
Don't ever think to avenge your late lord.
Be tactful.
I've been drinking since morning... and I've got pain here.
If the house is restored... you serve my master.
If you make trouble... after we take steps... it means trouble for all of us.
Don't forget it.
Don't forget it.
Don't forget my kindness.
Chamberlain!
Who?
I've heard everything!
Oh, Yasubei and Kazuemon?
Are you here?
Tell us!
Is it true?
You'll sacrifice us and serve Konoe?
Only a year and you forgot everything?
Enough!
Rotten from sake and women!
You call yourself Chamberlain?
Don't talk!
We came here representing others.
But we'll avenge our lord on our own.
We wish you a peaceful life.
Kazuemon.
I can't stand it!
Shut up!
Father!
I'll go to Edo with them!
My son.
A talk with you.
Come closer.
How well it's made, a plan is a plan.
It can never be perfect.
When it took place in March last year...
I've decided to kill
Lord Kira... and avenge my lord.
My lord's father died when he was a kid.
He became our lord at nine.
My father died young.
I became a chamberlain when I was only 18 too.
For more than 20 years since then...
I took care of him... as my younger brother... or son.
When he died last March... it pained me more than anything else.
I gave up the castle to avenge him... and I recommended his brother... to restore the house.
Since the shogunate hates our late lord...
I knew my petition wouldn't be taken up.
But people are funny.
They like our late lord.
They even made a song for it and hate Lord Kira.
Former vassals want to seize this chance.
But it troubles me all the more.
Even the shogunate official...
Superintendent Araki...
Submitted a petition for restoration of the house... and he informed me of it.
I thought it meddlesome.
Yet I have to wait for his neXt report.
Our lord's relatives started actions too.
And now, the Emperor's advisor too.
A drop at the beginning.
But...
But it's a big stream... even I can't stop it.
I started it all.
But it was... a big mistake.
Why not avenge our lord soon?
I won't be suffered so if I can do it.
I submitted a petition.
If I avenge my lord in spite of it...
It's ineXcusable.
People won't call it a clean revenge.
I just sit and wait the tide to change.
And wait for the orders.
I came, Kuranosuke.
Good news.
Important news from Edo.
Chamberlain.
I'll listen.
Tell me.
No greetings.
Our lord's brother was ordered... to leave Ako.
He'll be taken in custody in Hiroshima.
I see.
Taken in custody?
Yes, in Hiroshima.
No hope for restoring the house now.
Let's avenge our lord quickly.
People in Edo want you to join them.
I pretend until now.
You must've hated me for what I've been doing.
I'll leave for Edo right now.
Will you do it?
It's bad news for the Asano house.
But... we've reason to avenge our lord now.
Yes.
Now... we'll kill our enemy Lord Kira.
Even if Lord Uesugi helps him... we won't be afraid.
I've a favor to ask you.
We're busy, Riku.
No, we don't mind.
I see.
What is it?
My father sent a messenger to me.
He said it's ineXcusable, forgetting your house.
And told me to leave you.
I'd like you to divorce me as of today.
You mean you want to leave me?
For my sake?
Yes.
Matsunojo's the heir, so I won't take him.
I'll take Yoshichiyo and Kura with me.
I see.
You thought that far?
Yoshichiyo's weak.
Have him become a priest and pray for us.
I mean he can't become a samurai.
No.
You're not in an ordinary condition.
Be careful on the way home.
Attention, flight "a"!
Flight "a"!
Japanese aircraft sighted over Kunsing area.
Aggie blue from Aggie blue one.
Go ahead.
- Blue two okay, skipper.
- Blue three, check.
Blue four receiving you r5-s5, sir.
- Blue five, okay.
- Blue six, okay.
Eighteen attack bombers, three points to your right. Altitude about 15,000.
What do you know, only three to one. That won't even wake me up.
- Gordon to dale, over.
- Go ahead, sir.
Listen, dale, this is your first time up.
Don't try to win this war all by yourself.
- Stick close. Tail them in formation.
- Yes, sir.
What time is it?
- Look like those boozers are overdue.
- All safe and accounted for?
- Of course.
Of course.
Look, captain Jim!
Looky! Wham, wham!
Termites.
Better get a new oxygen tank.
She only registers 500.
Hap.
- You got something on your mind?
- Me?
Nothing but japs.
Why?
- You're not pulling out of your dives fast enough. - Oh?
I'll watch it.
- It only takes one.
- I know, Jim.
Hate to look around one day and find out you're the little man who wasn't there.
You and Reardon better go up this afternoon and simulate diving attack.
Mustn't get rusty.
Okay, Jim.
A little rough in spots, Dale, but I think when you iron a few things out-
Dale?
Dale?
Bill, take care of Dale.
Mike?
Yes, sir? Did that box of instruments come up from Rangoon?
Yes, sir.
Fix the panel in Dale's ship.
This belonged to Dale too.
Come in.
Quite a collection.
He should have stayed in college where he came from, but he begged for a chance.
Begged for it like some kid asking to go to the circus, and I gave it to him.
What happened?
He didn't watch his tail.
And outnumbered, as usual.
He did bring his ship back.
Yeah... He did.
But tomorrow or the next day, there will be somebody else in it...
With three of them on his tail.
- Or six or ten
- Jim.
- How's Miller?
- Just a flesh wound in the shoulder.
I'll give him back to you in a week.
How are you?
You can have me back anytime.
Why don't you go home?
You need a nurse.
Suppose you cut yourself shaving?
When did you sleep last?
Monday. It was a very good day for it.
Well, try thursdays. They're good days too. Excuse me.
Larry?
Get me the weather on M5, and check on those oil drums.
Find out what's holding them up.
As if I didn't already know.
- Think Hap could run this show for a couple of days? - Yes. Why?
I've got to run down to Rangoon. The colonel promised me some replacements.
- I'm gonna need them now that Dale..
- When will you be back?
Oh, I don't know.
Might keep right on going till I get to San Francisco.
Nice town, San Francisco.
Yeah.
There's a place on Fisherman's Wharf-
They serve oysters you have to cut with a knife.
Ever try Simpsons in London?
Roast beef you can cut with a fork.
No floor show though.
No floor show.
Take me with you.
No, Brooke, we can't do anything like that.
I know. I couldn't leave anyway.
There's a new batch of evacuee children coming this afternoon.
Wanted to see me, Jim?
Yeah, I want you to take care of the store while I'm away.
- Got to go to Rangoon.
- Sure.
Larry, have the station wagon brought around and put my things in it.
Got to catch a plane for Rangoon.
Did that gasoline shipment arrive yet?
I wish somebody would figure out a ship that would fly on rice.
Want to check the scoreboard?
Mccurdy will fly number two while you're in charge.
Make sure that second-string pitcher does some work on his guns.
Jim: Zero. Hap: Zero
Hap: Two
I thought you and Jim-
Didn't I tell you to credit my ship only to Dale?
Look, Jim, I got nobody back in the states.
I thought Dale's folks would find that
$1,000 bonus handy around the farm.
Or is it a gas station?
You got your halo on crooked, pal.
- Car's ready.
- Right.
Start working on Selby and Mcintosh as a team.
- I think they're about ready.
- Okay, Jim.
Don't worry about a thing. I'll take care of things while you're away.
Okay. And no gin rummy with Brooke.
- She's my pigeon. Bye, pigeon.
- Good-bye.
What do you see in that guy?
San Francisco.
Huh? never mind.
Any more on flight 8 from Hong Kong?
The airport informs me the plane has been delayed. The storm, you know.
Oh, there were two gentlemen here expecting me.
I believe they just came in.
You'll find them in the cocktail lounge with mrs. Bales.
Mrs. Bales?
- If anything more comes in on that plane, let me know. - Yes, sir.
Squadron leader Gordon, I'm lieutenant Barton. How are you?
- Hello, Blackie.
- Hello, Jim. My wife, Jim.
How do you do?
What are you doing here, Blackie?
I heard you needed pilots, and I needed the job.
I didn't know at the time that you were head man.
I'll run upstairs and pack.
- Excuse me. - Train leaves for
Lai Chau at 6:00 in the morning.
- Be on it.
- Yes, sir.
She knows, jim.
I hate to turn you down, Blackie but I've got to.
Look, Jim, I don't want to put this on a personal basis,
But you know me, you know my work.
- I'm a good flier, Jim.
- I know you are.
You could work for me anytime. We get along, but-
I haven't been on that stuff for a long time, Jim. Honest. That's just soda pop.
It isn't that. I'm trying to hold on to a fine bunch of men.
It isn't always easy to keep peace in the family.
Some of them would remember that Lefty Matson case.
- But, Jim, I was cleared of that.
- I know.
The army gave you a clean bill of health,
But you'd be flying with a lot of men that knew Lefty.
I'm really doing Blackie a favor, mrs. Bales.
I don't want any favors. I just want a chance to get back on my feet again.
This is the last outpost for me, Jim.
Oh, it just wouldn't work out. I'm sorry.
Good-bye, mrs. Bales,
Blackie.
Any news yet? No, sir. Not yet.
Oh Mr. Gordon, I made some excuse so I could talk to you.
No matter what happens, please don't ever tell Blackie that I did.
Of course.
Mr. Gordon, I hate to butt in like this,
But you've got to give him another chance to fly.
Mrs. Bales, I can't jeopardize the morale of an entire squadron...
Just to give your husband a job.
But it isn't just a job. Though we need the money, it's something more.
I married him right after that happened.
He told me the whole story.
I thought I could make it up to him, but I can't.
There's some things that even a wife can't do for the man she loves.
He's got to find it himself...
Doing the things he loves best,
Even if means paying with his life.
It isn't easy for me to say no. You don't know what you're asking me to do.
Oh, I do.
Do you know what losing your self-respect means?
That's what's happened to him.
I know.
I live with him.
I've caught him looking out of a window, watching a plane.
Watching it till he couldn't see it any more.
Afraid to turn around and look me in the face.
- Mrs. Bales... - Mr. Gordon, you know men.
You command a squadron.
You've seen them die.
Some of them go out smiling.
Have you ever seen the look on a man's face...
When you tell him he can't fly anymore?
No.
It's a living death, mr. Gordon. I know.
Please don't say any more.
I'd rather he went with you and took what came...
Than to live with him the rest of his life...
Watching him die a little every day.
Have him on that train tomorrow morning.
Thanks.
You can't go with him, you know.
Yes, I know.
And please don't ever tell Blackie I spoke to you.
I just received news for that plane from Hong Kong, sir.
It was attacked and fired upon by a japanese fighter squadron.
- Is it down? - No, sir. It's coming in on one wing and a prayer.
- Get me a cab.
- Yes, sir.
Rangoon calling again, Woody.
Jason, flight 8. Go ahead,
Rangoon. What do you want now?
Am I gonna bring the plane in? No, you dope!
I'm gonna park it up here on the clouds and wait till the storm blows over!
We did everything to cover your landing, Jason.
Fire and crash trucks are standing by.
- Bring her down easy.
- "easy"?
Rangoon calling Jason, flight 8.
What's your position?
My instruments tell me
I'm flying upside-down...
5,000 feet below Lake Michigan.
But I must be wrong because I can see the lights of the field.
Head for cover.
I'm coming in!
I can't see them, mr. Raffkin.
Bring that mike outside.
Lower the landing gear,
Alabama.
If he walks away from this, he's a miracle man.
Pull up, Woody!
You're coming in on one wheel!
- thanks.
- Woody, this is Jim Gordon.
- Jim? What are you doing up so late, pappy?
- Never mind that.
The runway at the north end of the field is mud and water.
Your only chance is to get that wheel up and skid in on your belly, but watch the wind.
Stop worrying, pappy. Just get that mob out of the way...
Or somebody will get a hot engine in their lap.
Pull up that landing gear.
You're gonna spill, Woody!
You're coming in crosswind!
Mm-mmm.
Good ol' real estate!
- Jim! - Woody! -
What do you say, pappy?
Nice landing.
- Did you like it?
- Why, you lucky-
- What do you mean, "lucky"?
- Coming in crosswind.
Why not? I wanted the wind to blow the fire away from the cabin.
Meet my better half while he's still awake. This is Alabama Smith.
- This is captain Jim Gordon of the Flying Tigers. - How are you?
That's enough. Jason, that was magnificent!
Save it. I'm gonna find a promotion for you.
Listen, you can take my job, the
Rangoon Airways, the Burmese... and the rest of this cockeyed country and give it back to Marco Polo!
- Chop, chop.
- But mr. Jason-
I didn't sign on to be a target for a bunch of four-eyed japs!
- You're not resigning?
- No, I'm quitting, definitely and for good.
And me too.
And forward mr. Jason's mail to Kunsing airfield.
Thank you very much, mr. Raffkin.
Here comes the replacements.
Take these men over to barracks.
- What's this thing?
- Headquarters.
It looks like the Taj
Mahal with a hangover.
What's that?
The milk bar?
No, the barracks. Pick out a cot with four legs if you can find one.
Dump your stuff and report back to me at the hangar.
What hangar?
That's a hangar? I like the green roof, but isn't it drafty?
I didn't promise you
La Guardia airport.
Look, pappy, if I'd have known this,
I wouldn't have come out here for $612 a month.
How did you get mixed up in this anyway?
- You never used to like chop suey.
- You'll find out.
Get yourself all set, and I'll see you later.
Okay, pappy.
Say! What are those things you wear on your backs, laundry tickets?
No, in case you're forced down in chinese territory,
They'll know you're an american volunteer.
What if you're forced down in enemy territory?
Then you've got nothing to worry about.
- You all set, Woody?
- Well. the red carpet's a little threadbare,
The brass band's a little out of tune,
But outside of that,
I'm all set.
Would you like the blue or the pink bridal suite, sir?
The blue comes with a sunken tub.
What did you expect, the La Guardia airport?
Huh?
Drop this off for me, will you?
I've got to make a reconnaissance.
I'm getting that old feeling.
Jim, is that you?
I won't be a minute.
I'm just finishing a bath.
Be right out.
How is Rangoon?
Did you have fun?
How many replacements did you bring back?
You would come back just when I was stealing a bath.
Then, of course, the boiler went burst and the water ran out-
Oh, hello.
- Jim Gordon with you?
- Won't I do?
Say, tell me something.
You always use Jim's tub?
- Yes, we all do.
- Cozy.
It happens to be the only bathtub in Kunsing.
I see. It must be a very chummy spot on Saturday night.
Do you sing and dance too or is your act limited to patter?
Oh, fine, fine.
You're one of the new replacements, aren't you?
Oh, no, not one of the replacements.
Jim told me he was having a little trouble out here,
So I thought
I'd give him a hand.
And I think
I'm going to like it.
I'm so glad.
If there's anything we can do to make you comfortable, don't hesitate to call on us.
Oh, I will, I will.
How about dinner?
Sorry.
I never get quite that hungry.
Oh, and if you should use the tub, you'll be sure and empty it, won't you?
We've no plumbing.
So sorry.
- What happened to that one?
- I overshot the field yesterday.
Came in a little too high,
I guess.
- I'll watch it.
- Jim!
- Brooke! Been behaving yourself?
- Mm-hmm.
No, she hasn't. She's been taking me at gin rummy since you left.
Oh, Woody.
- Miss Elliott, mr. Jason.
- We've met.
What do you think of glamour boy?
He's a difficult man to get to know. So shy.
Anybody in my spot would have done the same thing.
Hap Davis,
Woody Jason.
- Glad to have you with us, Jason.
- Thank you, Hap.
I'm gonna put him in your hands, Hap.
I don't need a nurse.
I've already got one.
- If you'll excuse me, I have to go on duty.
- Won't you wish me luck?
You don't really need it, do you?
- Did I do something wrong?
- Do you ever do anything right?
Pappy, why don't you stop picking on me?
Come on. I'll introduce you to the rest of the fellas.
I don't like to point, chum, but she happens to be the skipper's girl.
- Great. She's got a sense of humor, hasn't she? - We all have.
In fact, we wake up two or three times a night, laugh and go back to sleep.
I would have hated to have been in that burning plane with anybody else but Woody.
You don't have to sell Jason to us. We know he's got a good record.
But out here, everybody starts even.
Oh, yeah.
Does that go for me too?
Sure.
Sure, it does.
Thanks, fellas.
Thanks.
- Selby.
- Yeah?
- I got your 30 pasted together.
- Okay.
We're not sticklers for discipline here, Woody, but we expect results.
Relax.
- Gentlemen, this is Woody Jason.
- Hi, fellas.
- Hi, Woody.
- His bark is worse than his bite.
Shake hands and count your fingers.
- I'm Mccurdy from Brooklyn.
- How are you, Brooklyn?
You ever know a little girl by the name of Sally Eray?
No, you wouldn't.
You're not her type.
- My name's Norton. I'm from
- Don't tell me. I know.
A state of beautiful women. You ever know the Mcdott sisters from Fort Worth?
- I'm from Dallas.
- Oh.
Reardon, Maine. I don't think you'd know anybody I'd know. now, there's where you're wrong. I knew a redheaded girl by the name-
Selby, Michigan. Selby mi-
Hello, Michigan.
What a football team.
- I used to date a little... what do you call those? - Majorette.
Yeah, a majorette.
What a football team.
- My name's Mcintosh.
- How are you, Mac?
I come from nowhere.
You got a girl there?
Uh-
Bentley's that gal's name.
A tall brunette with a p-40 figure and plenty of armor.
- Boy, I can't wait till I get back.
- "Back"?
Yeah, you don't think I'm gonna make this my life's work, do you?
Give him time, boys.
He'll catch there's a war on.
I know there's a war, but you fellows have no part of it.
We're all out here for the same reason.
Dough.
Sure, that we are, but it's good to know every check you cash in... means a jap's cashed in too.
Wait a minute, fellas. We're all making the same salary:
600 bucks a month and 500 a jap, right?
Back home most of us would kill rattlesnakes whether there was a bounty on them or not.
I know, but you're protecting your own home. This is not our home.
It's not our fight. It's a business.
And boy I hope business is good.
- What's the matter with him?
- His brother crashed behind enemy lines.
We found him after the japs got through with him.
- I didn't mean anything personal
- We know you didn't, Woody.
- Let's take a walk.
- Yeah, but-
Get down!
- Tails up!
- Let's go.
- Come on, Alabama!
- Where are we going?
The bank's open!
- Is anybody hurt?
- Not yet.
- Which one do I take? - Are you crazy?
Wait till you get combat training.
"Training"? Me?
I'm losing dough!
And I'm running this outfit! Get back!
1,500 smackers up there, and that guy cuts me off!
- There's a shelter at the first aid.
- What are we waiting for?
I don't know, but I came out here to fly.
Hey, Woody!
That ain't the way!
Stop, stop!
No! No!
Come back here!
- Smart fellow taking plane. No bullets!
- No ammunition? what?
No got-
- Contact him by radio.
- Him no take earphone.
- Let's contact Jim!
- Yeah!
Aggie dispersal calling aggie blue one, Gordon.
- Aggie dispersal calling aggie blue one, Gordon. Go ahead.
Aggie blue one, Gordon, back to Aggie dispersal. Go ahead.
Hello, Gordon. Wingman
Jason took off in p-40 ship.
He's unarmed and without radio communication.
Request you locate and signal him to return to base immediately. Go ahead.
Okay!
Get your checkbook out, general.
Woody! Woody! Woody!
Woody, are you all right?
Oh, I'm all right.
Well, I walked away from that one.
Hey, whose side are you on?
Report to my office immediately.
Okay, pappy.
A few more landings like that, and he'll be a japanese ace.
Where do you think you are, with some broken-down flying circus?
It would have been a cinch. I was riding the murder spot right above those japolas.
If I had ammunition, I'd have blown them clear out of China.
And you washed out a good ship.
You talk like that crate is more important than me.
I can't afford to lose either planes or pilots.
Pappy, it's like I told you down at the barracks:
All I get out of this is the dough, so you can't blame me for trying.
In a skeet match, the guy who knocks down the most pigeons wins the cup.
I can't have grandstanders trying to hog the whole show.
Results here are based on cooperation and understanding.
Discipline in the air is strict because that's the only way... an outfit like this can operate.
- Wait, Hap.
- All right, I'll admit I was wrong.
I made a mistake.
Okay.
In this kind of warfare, a fella likes to feel he's flying with somebody he can trust.
- What do I care? It's every man for himself, isn't it? - Not these days.
Wait till you look back and see a jap sitting on your tail...
In a ship that you can't outmaneuver.
- Then you'll know what I'm talking about.
- Okay, pappy.
From now on, I'll study my lessons and practice the piano every day.
There won't be any more trouble.
I'll be a modest, respectful soldier if it kills me, I swear.
Okay, Woody.
You got a cigarette?
- Keep them.
- Thanks.
You got a match?
Afraid you're gonna have a little trouble with that ball of fire, skipper.
Oh, Woody's all right.
Gets a little off beam once in a while,
But he's gonna develop into the best flier in this squadron.
That's what counts.
You see how he went after those three japs? That took nerve!
Yeah, he's got nerve, all right.
Got a cigarette?
These are the planes you'll be tangling with.
Know them so you can identify them.
Plenty of these planes carry detachable auxiliary gas tanks,
Which give them great range.
These tanks are dropped when they reach the objective,
So they don't lessen the plane's fighting efficiency.
The Kawanishi 96 can carry about a half a ton of bombs as well as scout.
But the most modern fighter, and the toughest one to crack, is the Nakajima.
It isn't fast, but it's light and maneuverable.
If you find yourself in trouble and have to bail out, there's one important thing to remember:
Do a closed-chute fall.
Drop as far as possible outside the combat area before pulling the cord.
That's to prevent our little brown friends from following you down...
And machine-gunning you while you're hanging helplessly in the air.
It's a quaint little habit of theirs.
And watch for the man who's hit the silk.
Protect him whenever possible.
You know what I'm not gonna do, pappy?
I'm not gonna ask you what to do if that chute doesn't open...
- Because you'll say-
- Take it back to the factory. oh, yeah.
No hits, no runs, no errors.
There must be something
I'm doing wrong.
Yesterday I unloaded a whole case of shells...
Before I seen I was firing at my own shadow on a cloud.
You keep shooting at those clouds, the angels are gonna get sore at you, boy.
Thirteen for our team and nobody benched. Nice work, boys.
- Thirteen?
- You ain't superstitious, are you?
If you are, the next time
I go up, I'll make it 14.
Yeah, I'll bet.
I could take that scoreboard down to the bank and cash it in right now.
Two thousand smackers, and today's only Thursday.
Any of you hangar pilots top that yet?
I knew a fellow who tied it once, only he didn't live to spend it.
It's too bad he waited. I have a feeling, that if
I hit my stride, you guys can take a vacation.
- At my expense, of course.
- How does it feel to be a one-man team?
- I don't get it.
- You're not the first ball carrier... that didn't appreciate his interference.
Give me that in straight English.
Twice I've been on the tail of a Nakajima... when you've cut in for the kill and the credit.
- Hold it, Blackie.
- Wait a minute.
Let him talk.
There's only one guy you think of up there
Woody Jason.
Listen, sorehead, every time I ever cut in on you I probably saved your life.
If I were you, I'd be the last guy to talk about cutting in.
I saw the tunnel that my pal Lefty
Matson dug in the Cleveland air races.
Probably figured his turn wrong.
Everybody saw what happened.
Oh, sure. It was all cleared up in the investigation.
But they forgot to smell your breath.
- Quit it! Save it!
- Attention, "a" flight,
Elements "a," "b" and "c".
Enemy aircraft in force over Mekong bridge. Tails up!
- Get moving, you two guys!
- I'm not through with you yet.
Okay, Tom.
You know where I live.
Hear about Jason?
He got another nippo today.
Yeah. It's too bad they don't pay off on dead pilots.
Hey, wait a minute, fellas.
You can't pin this mistake on me.
If Blackie hadn't opened his parachute so soon, it wouldn't have happened.
Maybe if you'd have followed Blackie down, it wouldn't have happened either.
- You were nearest to him. What happened?
- A Mitsi got in my way.
I guess it's easier to see 500 bucks than a pal of yours in trouble.
Hey, you got five planes now.
That makes you an ace.
"ace"?
How do you spell it?
Mike, that ship gassed?
- Yeah, him full to top.
- Okay.
Oh, Jim, do you mind if I use that ship?
- Where are you going?
- Up for some fresh air.
It's a little heavy in the barracks.
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.
Woody.
I got to know the truth about one thing:
Could you have prevented
Blackie Bales' death?
No, Jim. I saw him fall, but I didn't see him open his chute.
I was sure he'd wait until he was safe.
If I thought he was in danger,
I'd have looked after him.
That's good enough for me.
Thanks, pappy.
I never saw anything like the way he went after those ships.
It was something. First one and then another and then-
None of us want to go, mrs. Bales.
We'd all like to live to be 108.
But few of us get a chance to go out... in a blaze of glory like Blackie did.
H- he wasn't afraid.
Blackie wasn't afraid of anything.
You know, we got a pretty tough bunch of guys up there.
They've got to be for what they're up against.
But when it came to real fighting spirit, none could touch Blackie.
- D-did they like him?
- Oh, they were crazy about him.
He was great to be around;
Always making cracks and keeping people's spirits up.
I'm glad.
I suppose you'll be going back to the states.
This belonged to Blackie.
So much?
Oh, sure. He knocked a couple down the week before.
- He never wrote me.
- That shows you what kind of a guy he was.
He wouldn't even tell his wife how well he was doing.
Well...
I got to be going.
Good-bye...
And good luck to you.
Good afternoon, nurse. Good afternoon, madam Montier.
Are those our children laughing?
- Yes. It's that wonderful young man you sent to us. - I sent you?
You were a saint to think of it.
He's the first ray of sunlight these children have known in months.
I think I'll take a look at mr. Sunbeam.
Hurry, hurry, hurry. You're just about to witness that great, that colossal,
That stupendous mystery known as the disappearing half a dollar or-
Or now you see it and now you don't.
Now I need a young lady to assist me.
Will any young lady step up, please?
Some young lady, any young lady?
You, come on.
Come on. Aw, come on.
Come on.
Aw, come on.
That's the girl. thank you.
Oh, boy. This will amaze you before your very eyes!
In my hand here I have a brand-new half a dollar.
It's brand-new. I made it myself this morning. you can still smell the mint on it.
Uh, I will make it disappear into my elbow. Watch very closely.
Here it goes. Don't take your eyes off of my hand.
Well, now, watch me very closely.
Watch very closely what happens.
See? Oop, it slipped!
Watch it closely. You see?
Watch my hand. Everybody watch it very closely.
Here it goes.
One, two, three.
Hocus-pocus, bowlegged locust.
What happens? It's gone!
What do you know about that?
How do you like that, huh?
I wonder where it is now.
I wonder where it could be.
I think I know.
Yes, I do.
I see it.
Here it is, right behind your ear!
What do you know about that?
How do you like that?
Isn't that wonderful?
Yes, well, thank you very much, miss.
And now- excuse me.
Don't tell them, but that's the only trick I know.
You see, my public won't let me go.
If you persuade your public inside, I might be able to change some bandages.
Absolutely.
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
Right this way to see the beautiful nurse perform the greatest trick.
She is lovely, she is beautiful... And she's mad at me.
Hurry, hurry.
Come quickly.
Well, I guess they're going away.
I hope so.
Have the children get ready.
I'll change their bandages now.
Careful. She's slipping. They're pretty tough to hold when they're this young.
Some of them never get any older.
Where did you dig up all these kids?
Most of them were "dug up," as you put it, after the bombings.
Are they all orphans?
The little girl you're holding walked almost 1,000 miles across China to get here.
She lived on roots or whatever else she could find to eat.
How did she find this place?
I don't know. Some instinct brings them here.
Or, perhaps, one child tells another.
But always after a bombing, here they are:
Starved, patient, silent.
- I had no idea.
- Very few people do.
Well-
There you are, darling.
- What's she selling?
- She's brought you these rice cakes as a tribute.
Tribute? For what? That corny trick with the half a dollar?
No, for your courage and loyalty as a member of the Flying Tigers.
Oh.
What else did she say?
Um, we are humbly grateful and beg you to accept these useless rice cakes... even though they are not worthy of so honorable and so brave a warrior.
Yeah, well, tell her okay and thanks,
And I'll keep them flying.
Thank you.
Why don't you have dinner with me tonight, and we can have these for desert?
Sorry.
No?
I'm having dinner with Jim.
Hey, these are good!
You want I should come back again or you want to order now?
What's good tonight?
We have special american dishes:
Egg fu yung, candied duck or chop suey.
Have you any roast beef you can cut with a fork?
You surely have oysters you can cut with a knife?
- No floor show?
- No, sir. No floor show.
But music...
Very nice.
Can't you turn that record over? Has it only got one side?
Oh, him turn over, no music,
- But him turn over.
- Never mind.
- We're getting so we like it.
- Thank you.
Look, chin, why don't you surprise us?
Bring us something new like... Chow Mein.
Ah, very nice. Very good chow mein. American dishes.
Oh, I'm sorry, Brooke.
- Sorry? What are you talking about?
Well, you know, all this.
If we were back in the states, we'd be having dinner at some good restaurant,
Dancing once or twice, might even go out to a show.
What's the matter with this?
The food here is excellent.
As for the music, there's a wonderful orchestra on that record.
A little hoarse by now, but we can still dance.
Ask me and see.
Miss Elliott, may I have this dance?
I've promised it to that dashing lieutenant in the horse marines...
But I don't think he'll mind.
- What's wrong?
- This came for you.
It's in code, so I thought it might be important.
- I hate to break in on you two.
- That's all right, Hap.
- I'll have to get back to the field and decode this. - Of course.
Sorry, Brooke. I guess we can never really plan anything-
Ah, it's ready.
Nice dish, very nice.
- Sorry, Chin. We got to run along.
- What I do with this?
You eat it.
Me eat this?
No, sir. No, sir.
I dragged you all out of bed and every place else because this arrived.
I haven't had any mail for months.
I didn't know that any of your friends could write.
Well, here it is.
"Commencing the first-" that's tomorrow.
Your squadron assumes continuous night reconnaissance in alternating patrols".
Signed R.T. Lindsay and so forth.
In simple language, that means we start a night patrol as well as day.
But, Jim, we're not set up for night flying.
We have no beacon and no landing lights.
- We'll use the headlights on the trucks.
- How?
We have six vehicles. We'll line three up on each side of the runway.
That's all right for takeoffs, but what about landings?
Those lights can be seen from
5,000 feet up on a clear night.
Fine. Suppose there's a ground fog. What happens then?
Well, Woody, all you have to do is use your fog knife.
"fog knife"?
What's that?
- Don't tell me Jason hasn't got one of those.
- Every ace has one.
Sure. When you're caught in a heavy fog,
All you do is cut a hole in it with your fog knife...
And drop down like in an elevator.
You must have fallen through one of those holes on your head.
Easy, easy. Let's save that for the annual barbecue.
Now pay attention. No pilots must leave the post.
All leaves are automatically canceled.
Starting tomorrow morning at
Must report to dr. Singh for a physical checkup.
That's all.
Scatter and get some sleep.
- Woody.
- Yeah?
- Got a minute?
- Sure.
- What are you gonna do, stand me in the corner? - No.
I'll be leading flight "a," and
Hap here will be leading flight "b".
I want you to take over
Hap's old position,
Number two in back of me and my flight.
Okay, pappy.
Don't worry about a thing. Good night.
Good night, skipper.
Good night, Hap.
Some of you guys don't seem to understand the reasons for these special tests.
Sure we do. It's to find out if we need a seeing eye dog. okay, okay.
It's funny now.
The first time you're on a night flight...
And a string of tracers come hissing out at you from the dark,
You'll be glad we rechecked your eyesight and reflexes. Sure. We know that.
Night patrol calls for peak efficiency and perfect physical fitness.
Right.
- Where did you dig that up?
- Well, I've been studying.
Don't, doc. That's cold, and I'm ticklish.
Nothing wrong with his reflexes.
Alignment blocks, please.
Is everything all right?
All these reports go to squadron leader Gordon.
The final decision rests with him.
I sure would hate to miss out on night patrol.
I hear those japos glow in the dark like bugs.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Having your oil changed?
Well, is my eyesight failing me or is it that beautiful hunk of man?
You keep that up and someday they'll put you on the radio.
Come on, fellas. Let's go to the gasoline dump and get a breath of fresh air.
- You asked for that. Jason
- Okay, okay! I'm not beefing, am I?
- Where's the gadget you wanted me to come back for, doctor? - Yes, over here, please.
When I examined mr. Jason this morning, this had not arrived yet.
I asked him to come back with the others.
- Is that what you wanted?
- Yes, thank you.
- Thank you. - You know, Jason, people that fly upside down...
.get a pretty twisted picture of what's going on all around them.
Yeah, thanks, Hap.
Thanks a lot.
You well enough to travel, Alabama?
Huh?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
All right, mr. Hap.
Think I'll fall apart, doc?
You should outlive
Confucius.
That's good enough for me.
You want to see me, skipper?
Sit down, hap.
I've made a change.
Tex Norton will lead flight "b" instead of you. That's okay, Jim.
I'd rather be up there in my old spot anyway, protecting your tail.
It isn't that, Hap.
I gotta hand you one on the chin.
But I'd rather it came from me than from somebody else.
Go ahead, Jim.
You're through flying.
The doc said I'd live to be a hundred.
If you stay on the ground.
Oh.
I see.
Okay.
- Was there anything else?
- No.
Wait a minute.
I can't send a man up that doesn't know whether he's flying upside-down or not.
Take a look at that physical.
Your depth perception's a mile off.
I know you've been gunning 'em since they were box kites with broomsticks for rudders,
But, you gotta believe me,
I'm doing this for you!
You've been close winging in formations, overshooting your landings-
You don't have to say any more!
I'm sorry.
I was kind of figuring on going back to the states anyway,
Maybe get me a chicken ranch or something.
- I hear there's a lot of dough in eggs.
- Eggs?
Who are you trying to kid?
You haven't been saving any money.
You've been giving it away as fast as you make it.
Look, Hap,
I need you here.
What could I do now?
Taking care of these crates on the ground is just as important...
As flying them upstairs.
I got to have a man
I can trust on the ground.
I wish you'd take that job,
Hap.
- You're not doing this to...
- No.
I really need you.
Well, ground kind of hurts my arches,
But, well,
I'll think about it.
Thanks, Hap.
Wait a minute.
I didn't swing at that one.
Come on.
Okay. I never could bat without my spike shoes anyway.
- Come on, come on.
- You're out.
Come on, let her go.
- Woody.
- Hello!
- How are things going?
- You better not be seen talking to me.
I'm poison ivy. Everything I touch breaks out into a rash.
I, um, I just got a letter from mrs. Bales.
- What's she writing you about?
- I sent her Blackie's things. She wrote to thank me.
- Oh. - She said to be sure and give you her regards.
- Well, um... - You are a difficult man to get to know, aren't you?
Why don't you have dinner with me tonight and get to know me better?
You don't take no for an answer, do you?
Why should I, when it's just as easy to say yes?
- Isn't it?
- Yes.
Well, swell! I'll meet you tonight at the orphanage at 8:00.
- Right?
- Okay. See you later.
Uh, wait a minute.
Don't say anything to anybody about mrs. Bales, will you?
I don't want to spoil my record. All right.
And be on time!
Hey, 'bama.
Those guys only got seven lucky hits off of me in three innings.
Yeah, swell. I'm going off the reservation tonight. I got a date.
What about night patrol?
You're on "a" flight.
Oh, don't worry about it.
I'll be back in time.
But if anyone asks any questions about me, you cover me.
I'm getting that old feeling.
All right, fellas, synchronize your watches at 10:55.
It's now 10:54 and 57...
58, 59, mark it.
- Tex, "b" flight must relieve us at exactly 11:55. - Right.
Otherwise, we might mistake you for the enemy. That's about it.
Take off in four minutes.
I thought Jason was here.
Well, I thought I saw him getting dressed just a few minutes ago, sir.
- Well, get him on the field.
- Yes, sir.
Warm 'em up.
- Did you see Woody? I just stalled the skipper. - No.
He'll wring my neck too if he finds out Woody left the field.
- Against orders?
- Yeah, but he said he'd be right back.
Well, he's Jim's number two man.
He'd better be back.
Tell pilot Jason takeoff is in two minutes.
Yes, sir.
- All right, warm it up, Mike.
- Okeydokey.
- Waiting for mr. Jason, please.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Tell him he'll be right there.
- Yes, sir.
- I still don't think this is right.
- You keep your mouth shut.
But if anybody's gonna take
Woody's flight, it ought to be me.
Are you crazy? I've been flying number two for Jim for over a year.
I know every one of his quirks, every one of his moves.
- We're a team. Don't you understand?
- Yeah, I know, but-
It's like he was the ball carrier and I was his interference.
Yeah, sure, but I still don't like it.
- You're to stay on the ground.
- Not so long as Jim is in the air.
Missed the 5:15 again.
- You're gonna have a hard time talking yourself out of this one. - Who, me and pappy? No.
- I wonder who's flying number two?
- Where have you been?
- I'm late. So what?
- So hap took your flight, that's what.
- All right, I'd do as much for him, wouldn't I?
- But Hap was grounded.
Yeah.
"a" leader to "a" two.
Go ahead.
What's the matter, Jason?
Have you gone to sleep?
"a" two to "a" leader.
What do you want? Go ahead.
Hap! Where's Jason? What are you doing here? Go on back!
Sorry, Jim. Remember me? I'm the little man who's always there.
Besides, it's too late.
"a" leader to flight "a". Nakajima fighters on port quarter. Combat formation.
Attaboy, skipper!
Give 'em the old one-two!
Don't worry, Jim.
I'm climbing his back porch now.
Pull out, Hap!
Pull out!
I hope you two had a good time...
'cause Hap paid the check.
Jim.
There's an army truck out of here day after tomorrow for Lai Chau. Be on it.
- Don't say that, Jim.
- Until then, you're confined to your quarters.
But I'm still a good flyer.
I'll knock down ten of those rats for every one of our boys.
It's out of my hands now. None of these men will ever fly with you again,
And they have to fly.
Yesterday...
December 7, 1941...
A date which will live... in infamy.
The United States of America...
Was suddenly and deliberately attacked...
By naval and air forces... of the empire of Japan.
The United States was at peace with that nation... and at the solicitation of Japan... was still in conversation... with its government and its emperor...
Looking towards the maintenance of peace in the pacific.
I believe that I incorporate the will of the congress... and of the people when I assert... that we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost,
But will make it very certain...
That this form of treachery... shall never again endanger us.
Hostilities exist. there is no blinking at the fact... that our people, our territory... and our interests... are in grave danger.
With confidence in our armed forces,
With the unbounding determination... of our people, we will gain... the inevitable triumph...
So help us, god.
I ask that the congress declare...
That since the unprovoked... and dastardly attack by Japan... on Sunday,
December 7, 1941... a state of war has existed... between the United States... and the japanese empire.
- How are you, Jim?
- Good, colonel. And you?
I don't have to tell you what our entrance into the war means... to the volunteer group in China.
Our responsibility is grave. You and your men will have to take greater risks now.
I think they know it, sir.
This hits them where they live.
- I don't think any of them will let you down.
- I'm sure they won't.
Come here.
Intelligence reports that the japanese are starting a new drive from this point.
But to camouflage that move, they're starting a fake attack from this point.
Under cover of which, they intend to bring up supplies and munitions from here.
Now, we must destroy this bridge and delay the supply trains which pass over it.
- I see. - That's the only way we can give general Chiang Kai-Shek... sufficient time to establish his defenses.
I know that area. It's a nest of antiaircraft and Nakajima squadrons.
Thank you. They can send up an anac umbrella... high enough to make any attack ineffective.
I warned you what we'd be up against.
- But there's a way to do it, I think.
- Yeah?
A bomber squadron, even with our protection, wouldn't stand a chance.
- But a single ship might get through.
- How?
By flying through the canyons instead of over them.
Taking off at dawn and hugging the sides of the hills away from the sun,
A pilot might bring his ship through the pass and directly over the bridge.
- Sounds like hedgehopping to suicide.
- Maybe.
But if you think it can be done,
I'll order a bomber here right away.
- I think we can use that transport.
- What?
They've been flying over enemy territory for five years.
They get potted at, of course, but they don't attract as much attention as a military ship.
What about bombs? It's got no bomb rack, no bomb release, nothing.
We can figure that out.
There's eight or nine cans in our munition dump marked, "nitro U.S.A".
I think I can find a messenger boy to deliver them.
A job for a volunteer, of course.
Of course.
Doggone it. You ought to be tar and feathered, Woody.
Getting yourself slung out of this outfit just when things are getting exciting.
What's going on out there?
- Huh?
- You heard me. What's happening?
That's the skipper's idea.
He's gonna go fix breakfast for the jappies.
Gonna serve them soup.
- Who's going with him?
- Nobody.
If you ask me, it's a one-way trip.
These reports must go out daily to keep colonel Lindsay informed on our status.
Yes, sir. Ship Norton to ground operation,
Selby and Evans to night patrol, flight "a".
- Miller ought to be about ready now to start in again with Reardon as a team. - Right.
That's about all, except you'll have to keep after Kunming for gas, oil and supplies... and Toungoo for replacements.
- Take good care of the store, Mac.
- I will, sir.
I- good luck to you.
Thank you, mac.
Come in.
Yes?
I have dr. Singh's report on Barton.
How is he?
You can have him back in a week.
- Colonel Lindsay's waiting outside, Jim.
- Right.
Jim!
Good luck.
Thanks.
I haven't wanted to question you, Jim,
But I thought you were gonna call for volunteers.
It only takes one, doesn't it?
Thank you, colonel.
Mike, rev it down!
Mike, cut those motors!
What do you think you're doing?
Cut those motors!
Get into your parachute.
I'd land and throw you out if I could take a chance on that cargo back there.
Bail out at 1,500.
You can't handle this crate all by yourself. It's a job for the two of us.
Somebody's got to handle this stick while the other guy drops the stuff.
- You know that as well as I do.
- Not the way I got it rigged.
I know I've been a lot of trouble to you since we first got to be friends.
You're the only guy I know who stuck by me.
If you're trying to alibi the way you've been living, we'll run out of gas.
Maybe I did start out just to have a bunch of laughs-
Woody, anyone who looks ahead in this racket is crazy.
I don't blame you for grabbing what you can today.
You don't mean that. If you did, you'd have dropped me long ago.
Hit the silk.
Look, Jim...
I had to talk to you.
I don't know where
I'm going from here or...
When I'll see you again.
It's like
Brooke said:
I don't know anything about anything:
Why we're here, why we're fighting, all that sort of stuff.
She tried to straighten me out too.
Although half the time she was talking about you and roast beef...
And San Francisco and all those crazy things.
- See what I mean?
- Are we gonna say good-bye like this?
- Bail out!
Okay.
I got it coming to me.
But there's one thing you gotta get straight on.
A whole lot of us just don't grow up. We stay kids.
The most important thing to a kid is the street he lives on.
It's his life.
It's his whole world.
That was me when I first joined up with you.
Hong Kong, Shanghai,
Chungking-
They didn't mean anything to me.
Just a lot of names in a geography book,
Not towns where millions of people were being maimed and killed by bombs.
If you called them Texas,
Maine or Michigan...
That would have been different.
They were my street. That's why I acted the way I did.
Not because I was a heel, but because I was still a kid.
It cost another man's life to make a man out of me.
If you don't think that will stay on my mind as long as I live,
Then you don't know any more about me than... I think you did in the first place.
Well... That's all, and happy landing.
Sit down, Woody.
Check the course.
Okay, pappy.
Well, here we go into the tunnel of love.
Pull her up!
Did you know I used to drive a roller coaster?
- Delivering nitro?
- Yes.
- Were you killed?
- Uh-huh.
- Take over. I want to get into this chute.
- Right.
Looks like the supply trains are moving.
But the bridge ain't.
You may serve the soup course now, pappy.
Get her closer.
If I get any closer to that bridge we'll have to pay a toll charge.
- Let her go!
- Not yet!
Give the gentleman a cigar!
If they want to cross that river, they'll have to swim it.
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.
This crate's got enough lead in its belly to sink a battleship.
Don't look now, but our tail feathers are on fire.
- Huh?
- This is it, pappy. Let's take a powder.
Six cans of nitro aboard and that train's still running.
Yeah, but this is one train we're gonna have to miss. Come on, let's go.
- Right.
- Throw it on automatic.
Come on!
Hit the silk, Woody!
Here we go!
Happy landing, Jim.
Do me a favor, will you, pappy?
Give my leather jacket to
Reardon. He's a cold character.
Divide my address book evenly between the boys in the barracks. and give my silk scarf to the next head-chopper that thinks this is an easy racket.
Woody.
Come in.
- You sent for me, sir?
- Yes, Barratt.
This is your first time up. Don't try to win this war all by yourself.
Stay close to formation. If you find yourself in trouble, pour on the coal and head home.
- Yes, sir.
- Just a minute.
This is for you.
- Gee, thanks.
- Take good care of it.
- It belonged to a pretty good flier.
- Sure.
Flight "a". flight "a".
Reconnaissance patrol, two minutes.
- How about having dinner with me? I hear
Chin has a new record. - Swell.
- ROME OPEN CITY -
The incidents and characters herein, though based on the tragic and heroic events during the nine months of Nazi occupation, are fictional.
Any resemblance to actual incidents and characters is purely coincidental.
Soar high, Red Eagle
O'er swamp and sand
O'er dark pine forests
All hail my Brandenburg homeland
Dear God!
I'm coming!
- Engineer Giorgio Manfredi.
- He's not here.
Where is he?
We don't know.
He doesn't always sleep here.
Where does he go?
I don't know.
You know these young bachelors.
Of course.
Which is his room?
That way.
Search the house.
- Does he have many visitors?
- Before, but not now.
Of course.
- How many other lodgers here?
- Two.
- Where's the phone?
- End of the hallway.
Stop! I'll answer that!
Is Giorgio there?
Of course. Mr. Manfredi.
Who is this?
- A friend of his.
- What friend?
Who's this?
Who was that woman?
How should I know?
I didn't see her.
- Find anything?
- No, nothing.
- And that door?
- That's the terrace.
- Keep calm.
- Dear God!
- Who lives there?
- That's the Spanish embassy.
The city will be divided into 14 sectors.
The Schroder Plan, implemented in various European cities, will permit dragnet operations on a grand scale with minimum force.
Come in.
Sergeant Bauer phoned, sir.
They didn't find the person in question.
No? That's odd.
The landlady and servant were there.
Shall we bring them in?
No, that's not necessary.
Thank you.
Bad news?
Someone missed an appointment.
Someone important?
I hope so.
You know them?
No. Who are they?
He's an engineer by the name of Manfredi.
That name's come to our attention.
Seems he's a military leader of the National Liberation Committee.
I have good reason to believe it's the same man.
How did you spot him?
I found him while sitting right here at this desk.
Every evening I take a long stroll through Rome without leaving this office.
I'm fond of pictures that catch people unaware.
One comes across such interesting people.
For example, not long ago
I came across Mr. Manfredi and his little girlfriend.
I thought,
"I've seen this man somewhere."
Look at this group, for example.
Second from the left.
I received these from Berlin.
I'm not mistaken, am I?
Of course not.
It's the same person.
How annoying!
Excuse me.
What's all that noise?
Forgive me, Major.
We're interrogating that professor -
Fine, but keep him quiet.
How these Italians scream!
Indeed.
And who's the girl?
A certain Marina Mari, a cabaret performer.
Yes, I've seen her before.
Pretty girl.
Very pretty.
Take it easy!
I can't take anymore.
- What's going on?
- They stormed the bakery.
- What about you?
- Unfortunately I'm in uniform.
- Sergeant!
- What do they want?
I can't do anything!
This is a riot!
I'm helpless.
- But just four ounces a day -
The dirty rat even had pastries. Look!
And they said there was no flour!
Agostino, go get some.
I can't. I'm a sexton.
I'd go to hell.
Then wait for your pastries in heaven.
Put those down!
Pina, this is crazy.
In your condition?
Should I just starve to death?
Sergeant, help!
Go hang yourself!
I'll see you home.
Bread!
- Here we are.
- Thanks.
Shall I carry it up?
It's heavy.
This way it'll be lighter.
I really shouldn't, but I've been starving.
Pina, you think these Americans really exist?
It looks that way.
- How about eggs for 16 lire?
- Forget it.
How dare you talk black market in my presence!
Sergeant, save your breath.
See you.
- Who are you looking for?
- Does Francesco the printer live here?
- Yes, but he's out.
- Know where he went?
That's his business, not mine.
- Excuse me, but who are you?
- What's it to you?
- You must be Pina.
- How did you know?
Francesco always talks about you.
- So you're -
- A friend.
Stupid me!
I thought you were police!
What can I do for you?
- I need to get in his apartment.
I'll get the key.
Sorry. I couldn't find it.
This way.
It's a mess, but -
It doesn't matter.
Listen, do you know Don Pietro, the parish priest?
I'd like to speak to him.
- I'll go get him.
- No, not you.
- I'll send my boy.
- Better.
Wait for me in there.
Marcello!
What?
- Come down a minute.
- I can't.
- Go get Don Pietro, quick.
- I'm busy!
I said come down here!
I've told you not to go up to Romoletto's. It's dangerous.
Go get Don Pietro.
- What do I tell him?
To come here right away.
Now move it.
And don't fool around on the way.
- Don Pietro will be here shortly.
- Thanks.
We stormed a bakery this morning.
Second one this week.
How are the women?
Some know why they're doing it, but most just grab all the bread they can.
This morning someone filched some shoes and a scale.
I'd like to know who filched my stockings!
Excuse me.
I bet you did -
Mr. Manfredi!
What are you doing here?
Looking for me?
That's right.
I met him on the stairs and let him in -
You could have let me know!
It doesn't matter.
I just had a favor to ask.
You're fine just like that.
Excuse us.
You see Marina, right?
- Yes, at the cabaret.
Please tell her
I can't see her for a few days.
I'll phone if I can.
- Anything else?
- No, nothing else.
Then good-bye now.
- Does she live with you?
- She's my sister.
Surprised, huh?
I wonder what lies she's told you about where she lives.
She's ashamed of us "starving workers."
Says she's an artist.
But I wouldn't trade places with her.
Not because she's bad.
She's just stupid.
But how do you know Laura?
Sorry. I'm being nosy.
No, she's a good friend of a girl I know.
- Marina?
- You know her?
Since she was a baby!
Her mother was a concierge near my father's tinsmith shop.
She and Laura grew up together.
But please don't tell Marina what I said.
Don't worry.
I won't be seeing her again.
Why?
I just feel it's time to end it.
It's gone on too long anyway.
- Have you known her long?
- Four months.
I'd just arrived in Rome.
She used to eat in a certain restaurant.
One day the air-raid alarm went off, and everyone ran.
Just she and I were left.
She just laughed.
Wasn't scared at all.
- And you fell in love.
- It happens.
Yes, it does.
But she's not the woman for me.
Perhaps if I'd met her when she was younger.
A woman can change, especially when she's in love.
Who told you she's in love?
Why shouldn't she be?
Heavens,
I didn't even offer you coffee.
It's no bother.
It'll only take a moment.
Mind you, "coffee" in name only.
Stop all this ruckus!
I told you before: No rough stuff.
Watch out, Don Pietro!
Well, well.
It's a miracle to see you here.
- My mother sent me.
- She's smart. It'll do you good.
Don Pietro, let me finish.
She says to come quickly.
It's important.
- What?
- I don't know. She acted mysterious.
But I think someone's in Francesco's apartment.
Very well. Let's go.
Gilberto.
You, out of the way.
Agostino will be here soon.
You referee.
And behave yourselves.
Here!
Come here.
Why are you always running off?
Why don't you come around anymore?
- This is no time for catechism.
- What are you saying?
You priests can't understand, but we have to close ranks against the common enemy.
Who tells you these things?
Romoletto.
Romoletto?
Don Pietro, please don't tell anyone.
Here comes Purgatory.
Don Pietro.
- What have you got there?
- I've been shopping.
What a load of bread!
Was that your whole ration book?
Not even one coupon.
Why all this bread?
- They were celebrating this morning.
- What?
I don't know what holiday.
Even the baker didn't know.
Excuse me. I have to go.
- What holiday could it be?
- I don't understand.
I hope my mother knew about it.
Here you go.
It's not very good, but at least it's hot. Drink up.
Thanks. Francesco says you two are getting married.
The wedding's a little late... in my condition.
But we set a date a long time ago and had to keep postponing it.
- When is it?
- Tomorrow.
- I'll need to get you a present.
- Heavens no!
It's just a wartime wedding. Don Pietro says a few words and it's over.
- You're marrying in the church?
- Yes.
Francesco didn't want to, but I told him better Don Pietro, who's at least one of our own, then some Fascist at city hall, don't you think?
In a way you're right.
The truth is,
I believe in God.
Do you work?
I used to.
In a fuse factory.
But they threw us out.
The Germans are taking everything.
It must be Don Pietro.
Hello, Don Pietro.
Excuse me.
I'll be across the hall.
- Thanks for coming.
- Don't mention it.
- What's this?
- Who's in there?
None of your business.
Go get some water. Hurry up.
- I have to talk to you.
- Come on.
There are 500 men in the hills above Tagliacozzo.
They're good men.
We can't abandon them.
One of them will be waiting at 6:00 on the Tiburtine bridge.
I'd better not go, because I've been denounced.
Besides, the curfew's at 5:00 now.
I see.
I'll go.
- I knew you would.
- What's the message?
- No message.
It's money from the military committee.
Is it too much to ask?
No, too little, even, for those sacrificing their lives.
How will I recognize him?
He'll whistle that song
"Morning in Florence."
But of course you wouldn't know it.
- How's it go?
Like this.
Everyone's singing it.
Hello, Father.
How can I help you?
Would you have a statue of St. Anthony the Abbot?
Sorry, but there's not much demand for those now.
But I have a St. Roch.
Thanks, but I'm not interested.
Not interested in a saint like St. Roch?
Step inside.
Come and see.
It's a beauty too.
- Let's have a look.
I'll be going.
Remember to stop by Chiurazzi's.
I'll give you a good price.
I need to speak to Francesco.
The man with the tight shoes sent me.
Wait a moment.
Come in, Father.
They're waiting for you.
Down these stairs.
Don Pietro, what's happened?
Nothing serious, thank heavens, but it might have been.
The SS were at Manfredi's last night.
- We know. Where is he now?
At your place.
Pina let him in.
He'll be staying a few days.
He gave me this note.
I wanted to send him to the
Passionist monks. He'd be safer there.
But he said he'd be too isolated.
It's true.
But he's in greater danger now that he's been denounced.
Yes, Father, but if our few men all hid in monasteries -
- I understand.
- Allow me. This is our editor.
Pleased to meet you.
Same here.
I've heard a lot about you.
That's not good for my modesty or my health.
We appreciate all you've done for us.
It's my duty to help those in need.
Step into my office?
Here you are, Father.
Manfredi said it would be money.
There's not much to read in those books.
What do you mean?
Is it all like that?
- A thousand pages.
- One million lire.
- Precisely.
Who is it?
It's me. Open up.
- Guess who I saw this morning.
- I don't care.
- Manfredi. He came to see me.
- You? Where?
At my place.
What did he want?
He said he can't see you for a few days and that he'll call if necessary.
Nothing else?
He didn't explain?
No, and I didn't ask.
I was in my bathrobe and curlers.
Aren't you going to change?
You're on soon.
How did he know where you live?
Good question.
You must have told him.
I never told him.
Well, I certainly didn't tell him.
I don't like people knowing where I live.
Speaking of which,
I really can't stay there any longer.
Mind if I stay with you until I find another room?
Of course not.
I've told you many times.
You're a sweetheart.
- What are you looking for?
- A cigarette.
- I'll get you one.
- Fine!
Thanks.
- When did he come by?
- Who?
Giorgio.
Early this morning.
I was getting dressed.
Miss Mari, you're on.
I don't understand.
Are you in love with him or not?
He's nice, I'll give you that.
Would you kindly stay out of it?
It's nothing to me, as long as you're happy.
You feel sick?
No, it's nothing.
Marina... again?
You know it's bad for you.
That's stupid.
Lots of things are bad for us, but we do them anyway.
I'm coming.
Good evening. How are you?
Fine, and you?
How beautiful you look tonight!
But you're always so chic.
- I'll be going.
- Ah, Laura.
Try and hurry, or the boss will be mad.
- I have to go.
- Yes, dear.
Did you find some?
You're a darling!
He has no schedule anymore - always in and out.
And these days, when you shouldn't even stick your nose out the window.
He's always out and about.
- He must have a good reason.
- Let's hope so.
Agostino, I'm surprised at you.
Come now.
You think I don't know you were behind that hubbub at the bakery today?
- Me?
- Yes!
You think I'm an idiot?
I know all about it.
And if you keep up these antics, you're all headed for trouble.
- Let's hope not.
- Yes, let's.
Cabbage soup.
- I can tell.
What time is it?
The curfew's at 5:00.
Let's see. It's 4:30.
- I better be going.
- You want to leave a message?
I wanted to talk to Don Pietro, but I'll do it tomorrow before the wedding.
Ah, finally.
Good evening, Don Pietro.
I've told you not to cook on the heater.
And cabbage, no less.
Agostino, don't answer back.
- It's either the stove or the heater.
- Fine.
More books! No money for food, and you keep buying books.
Hands off.
I'm taking them to San Lorenzo.
You're going out again?
The curfew's in 20 minutes.
It doesn't matter.
Doctors and priests can still be out.
- And midwives too.
- What?
I read it on the posters.
But you could get shot in the dark with these thugs around.
Don Pietro, I came... for confession.
I have to go out.
Maybe tomorrow morning?
Fine.
I'll walk with you a ways now.
Let me carry your package.
We can't have a priest carrying a package.
Besides, I'm already carrying so much.
Come on, it's getting late.
Bye, Agostino.
- And stop worrying.
If this war isn't over soon,
I'll go crazy!
Are you the priest here?
Don Pietro Pellegrini?
I'd like to speak to you.
Please...
I'll be going.
Here's your package.
I wonder what he wants.
- Who knows?
Perhaps you should... wait for me over there.
Have a seat.
Step outside a moment.
Please.
What is it?
From Don Saverio Derisi, the priest in Minturno.
You mustn't think I'm a coward.
I can't take any more!
Don't lose heart.
I'll try to help you.
Where have you come from?
Cassino.
It's a living hell there!
What did he want?
No, I'll carry it.
He wanted information.
Just the sight of those guys and I -
My last confession was so long ago that I'm almost ashamed.
No, let me talk.
I've led a bad life.
I've done so much I shouldn't have.
You think I'm not ashamed to be married in my condition?
But you'd never understand.
There are things you do without thinking, that don't feel like you're doing wrong.
I was so in love, and he was so good, so decent.
I know he could have found someone better, a young girl, not a penniless widow with a child who had to sell everything just to get by.
And life just keeps getting harder.
How will we ever forget all this suffering, anxiety, and fear?
Doesn't Christ see us?
So many people ask me that:
"Doesn't Christ see us?"
But are we sure we haven't deserved this scourge?
Are we sure we've always lived according to the Lord's laws?
People never think of changing their ways, but when the piper must be paid, they despair and ask,
"Doesn't the Lord see us?
Doesn't he take pity on us?"
Yes, he does, but we have so much to be forgiven for, and for that we must pray and forgive many things.
You're right, but how do we forgive?
I see those guys and I want to smash their faces in.
You're right.
I mean... give me that package.
It's getting late.
Good-bye, Pina.
She came looking for help.
The Gestapo had hauled in her fiance.
"Don't worry. I'll take care of it,"
I told her.
What a pair of legs!
Halt! Hands up!
I have a permit.
Printer.
Says so right there.
All right.
Go home quickly.
Auf Wiedersehen, Captain, and thanks.
Good night.
See you tomorrow - don't forget.
Francesco, you scared me.
I'm a bit late.
They insisted on seeing me home.
Nothing wrong with that, is there?
Hi, Francesco.
- You got away, eh?
- This time at least, with the landlady and Nannina's help.
You know they tore the place apart this morning?
A waste of time.
There was nothing there.
- Pina let you in?
- Yes, she was very kind.
- What do you think?
- You're smart to marry her.
At first she took me for a cop and gave me hell.
I can imagine.
Did you know Don Pietro met Gino?
- Really? I'm glad.
What did he say about my matter?
He's worried.
You were to meet the old man today.
- When did he get in?
- Last night. But you can't see him.
Gino says you have to drop all contact with central for a while.
True, but to stop short after months of work!
How'd they catch on to me?
We have to find out what they know.
We'll try, but it won't be easy with the Gestapo.
If it was the Italian police -
Let's hope Don Pietro met our friend from Tagliacozzo.
Let's hope so.
Ah, I brought you our newspaper.
Came out all right, didn't it?
How many copies?
Twelve thousand.
That's Pina.
Hi. How are you?
I'm worried about Marcello.
He's disappeared.
I've searched the whole building.
- He's probably at Romoletto's.
- He's not.
And two other boys are missing too.
Where could they have gone?
- I'm afraid they've gone out.
- After curfew?
Well done.
I'm proud of you.
Let's step on it, boys.
Let's wait for Otello.
Good night.
So you're still alive!
Well, I'll kill you now!
If I had a father like that,
I'd show him.
Good night.
You little devil!
Coming home at this hour!
We'd better go in one at a time.
You're right. You go first.
You little monsters!
They're back.
Trouble-maker!
I'll tan your hide!
Give me heart failure, will you?
I'm going over for a minute or there'll be murder.
- Look how they look!
- Where were you?
- At Romoletto's.
- No, you weren't!
- We were downstairs.
- Where?
- Can't you see they're lying?
- I'll kill him!
No, I'll slap 'em silly!
Get to bed, you two.
Calm down.
- I've had it with them!
They're just kids.
I can't get a moment's peace here!
I work all day!
Some work!
What was that?
Speak clearly!
You'd better just go back to bed.
Can't I talk in my own home?
This is my home.
Go talk in your own room.
We pay for kitchen privileges.
- Laura, forget it.
Forget it?
I'm fed up with living in this zoo!
Then get out!
Do you people have to fight every night?
If she doesn't leave, one of these days I'll -
Elide, is it ready yet?
Oh! It's probably burned!
That little witch!
Come here.
It's a surprise.
Elide's baking a cake for your wedding tomorrow.
I hope you two won't quarrel at the last minute, because we're going to have a real feast!
- That's his greatest worry.
- Off to bed. Good night.
Turn out the light, will ya?
We fixed 'em good, eh?
You never take me along.
You're a woman!
So? Can't women be heroes too?
Sure, but Romoletto says that women always mean trouble.
You still awake?
Under the covers!
Go to sleep.
Can't sleep?
I'm not sleepy.
Where did you boys go with Romoletto?
I can't tell you.
Not even me?
No, it's a secret.
Then you're right.
You mustn't tell anyone.
Good night.
Hey...
What?
Do I really start calling you
"papa" tomorrow?
If you want.
I do. I really like you.
What's wrong?
I had a fight with my sister.
Again?
She wants to leave.
Says she won't even come to the wedding.
That's just talk.
No, she was serious.
She's packing her bags.
She'll change her mind tomorrow.
I'm so tired!
There now.
I'm so tired!
Go on and cry.
Come in for a while.
- No, he's in there.
- So? He's a friend.
I've wanted to talk with you alone for so long.
Come here.
Let's sit down here, like the very first time we talked.
Remember?
You knocked on my door with a look on your face -
You drove a nail in the wall and knocked my mirror down.
Luckily it didn't break.
"Who do you think you are?
King of the universe?"
You were so rude to me.
In two months you never once said hello on the stairs.
It's been two years now.
How long ago that seems now.
And how things have changed, though we were already at war then.
Everyone foolishly thought it would be over quickly and that we'd only see it on newsreels.
When is it going to end?
Sometimes I just can't go on.
This winter feels like it will never end.
It will end, Pina... and spring will come again, more beautiful than ever, because we'll be free.
We have to believe it and want it.
I can feel these things inside, but I can't explain them.
Manfredi could.
He's an educated man who's been to college and traveled.
He can really talk well.
But I think it's like this:
We mustn't be afraid now or in the future, because we're on the just path.
Understand, Pina?
We're fighting for something that has to be, that can't help coming.
The road may be long and hard, but we'll get there, and we'll see a better world.
And our children especially will see it -
Marcello and the one on the way.
That's why you mustn't ever be afraid, whatever happens.
Right?
But I'm never afraid.
Hello?
Ah, Miss Mari.
No one's seen him.
He hasn't at least called or sent someone over?
Nannina, tell me the truth.
You know something.
You know where he is.
I swear I don't.
If I did, I'd tell you.
Let's hope not.
Good night.
The dummy, asking for information over the phone.
The Gestapo will get us all!
Come in.
The chief of police, sir.
Show him in.
Dear friend, you've come at the right moment.
Something very interesting has turned up.
Our Mr. Manfredi was spotted this morning around Prenestino.
And just a while ago, a tank car of gasoline was blown up in the rail yard in the same area.
My dear major, my news is even more sensational.
I spent the afternoon in our records office, and I too had a very interesting encounter.
Fantastic!
"Ferraris, Luigi.
Born in Turin, October 3, 1906.
Arrested in Bologna on February 4, 1928.
Sentenced to 12 years for conspiring against the state.
Escaped during transport.
Spotted in Paris and Marseille."
Luigi Ferraris.
You've outdone me.
- Oh, I would never presume.
In any case, the important thing still remains: To nab him.
Don't worry.
He won't get away from me.
- Shall I see to it?
- I forbid you!
I mean... not that I don't trust your methods, but I prefer to do it myself.
Excuse me.
Ingrid.
Good evening. How are you?
My dear lady.
Thanks for the flowers and coffee.
I see you're corrupting my staff, but you're forgiven.
He's made a very interesting discovery.
Really?
Fantastic!
The time for talk is over.
We must act immediately.
Yes. Leave it to me.
Hello.
Hello, children.
Praised be Jesus Christ.
Forever and ever.
Praised be Jesus Christ.
Forever and ever.
But you're always the last... to praise him.
Who is it?
Police!
Morning, Sergeant.
Wait a moment. I'm dressing.
Then with your permission, we'll pay our respects to your intended.
The Germans and Fascists are surrounding the building.
Let's go.
Get everybody out of the building, now!
They're surrounding the building.
Get inside.
Go up and bring everyone down, from every floor.
You go that way and do the same.
Tell them they're to go upstairs and bring everyone down immediately.
You three go that way and bring everybody down.
You men go that way and do the same.
Be strict with these tenants.
What are you doing?
Come here.
Come here!
What's he looking for?
What are you doing here?
I'm here on duty, but I have to go.
I'm a sergeant.
Nonsense. He stays here.
You must stay here.
Marcello!
- What is it?
- The Germans and Fascists!
- Where?
- In our building.
- Let's go, boys.
- Hold it there a moment.
It's the Germans!
- You stay here. I'll go.
- We have to go too!
I said to stay here.
But Romoletto has bombs in the attic.
- Quick, to the railroad!
- The Germans are downstairs.
- Francesco?
- He's getting rid of the stuff.
Don't worry.
They won't find him.
- Don't tell Pina.
- Don't worry.
- What are you doing here?
- Getting my things.
Get outside.
We'll see that no one touches them.
How stupid of me not to think of that.
Hurry. Over there.
- Where's Francesco?
- Don't worry. He's safe.
Those bastards!
They're even dragging the sick down.
Grandfather wouldn't come down.
What'll they do to him?
Nothing. Don't worry.
Go over there.
My boy!
Giorgio!
Just look at that!
- Where was he hiding?
- I don't know.
They took him away.
What'll they do to him?
No men in this building?
Nonsense!
Where are all the men?
You hear?
Where are the men?
How should I know?
I'm not the doorman.
What does he want?
- Where are you going?
- To comfort a sick man.
The parish priest.
Don't bother.
We brought everyone down for a little fresh air.
Impossible. A man that sick?
I have to go up.
Hold it!
Ah, finally. The poor man was begging for you.
He's probably dead by now.
Go on.
Wait!
They brought everyone down.
No, not this paralyzed old man.
Hurry, Father.
Some service!
They used to be as prompt as firemen.
Romoletto, open up!
It's me and Don Pietro!
Go away!
Open up!
Go away, or you'll be blown up with me.
I said to open up!
- What are you doing?
- I'll kill them all!
You want to kill us all, you lunatic?
Hold it there!
Help, Antonio!
Let me go!
What floor is this dying man on?
I don't know.
Third or fourth.
I'll go have a look.
I'm a bit of a doctor myself.
I'll go too.
No, I don't like your face.
No one's here.
Let's try the next floor.
The door!
Are you crazy?
What are you doing here?
I'm perfectly fine!
Lie back down and pretend you're sick.
I'm fine!
I'll live to be 100!
The SS are coming!
The Germans!
To hell with the Germans, and the Fascists too -
Hand me that.
Look in there.
Come on, wake up.
Give me that.
Come on.
You really let him have it!
It's all right.
You have pretty eyes.
Bastard!
Get ready.
Watch for when they round the turn.
Aim at the drivers.
Flavio, us bring meat.
- Where?
- Here.
What good is this?
I'm an innkeeper, not a butcher.
Us slaughter.
Yes, you people specialize in that.
Good evening, Mr. Manfredi.
Go right in.
Evening, sir.
Miss Mari's waiting for you.
Let's leave.
Giorgio, finally!
I've looked everywhere for you.
I hoped you'd come here.
What's happened?
Nothing. Why?
What could have happened?
I don't understand.
At your place -
Allow me to introduce a friend.
Sit down, Francesco.
It's a pleasure. Marina.
The SS were looking for you?
- Who said so?
Your concierge.
But why?
Maybe 'cause I'm an officer.
- Where are you staying now?
- We'll stay with a friend tonight.
Why not my place?
- No.
- Why?
I wouldn't impose, and he's with me.
He can take the sofa.
You'll be very comfortable.
- Spaghetti for three?
- We'll talk later.
- Ration books, please.
- I don't have one.
I'll give him a coupon for you.
- What else?
- I'll take care of these folks.
- They arrested Mezzetti.
- When?
At 6:00 this morning.
The painter told me.
If we don't lay low for a while, they'll nab us all.
You planned to stay there, right?
Someone here talked.
Poor creatures.
There's always an American station playing jazz at this hour.
Shall we have a little drink, boys?
This liqueur was a gift.
It'll warm us up.
Do you feel ill?
You have a fever.
He's burning up.
I'll make up your bed.
- Don't go to any bother.
Chin up, Francesco.
Help me, Giorgio.
You'll see.
You'll be very comfortable.
I'll get you an aspirin when you're in bed.
Hand me that blanket, please.
You have to be careful.
There's plenty of flu going around.
It's all there's plenty of these days!
Who can that be at this hour?
Who is it?
- Marina, it's me.
- Oh, it's you.
Hello, sweetie.
You see, I did come!
Fritz didn't want to let me go -
Are you drunk?
A wee bit.
Then go straight to bed.
Who's in there?
You got company?
Oh, the engineer!
Laura, go to bed!
I'm not gonna eat him!
Francesco, what are you doing here?
Pina kicked you out on your wedding night!
I think Marina's right.
Put her to bed.
Come on.
What long faces!
What a welcome!
I should have stayed with Fritz.
I'm going to tell Pina.
Go to bed.
I'll get you some aspirin.
I fought with my sister.
I'm never going back.
- Marina.
- Come in.
Don't look!
I came to get aspirin.
There should be some in the drawer.
That idiot was just what we needed.
What do we do now?
Where will you sleep?
Don't worry.
I'll be fine in an armchair.
You'll be cold and uncomfortable.
What a shame.
Hello?
Oh, it's you.
Good evening.
How are you, sweetheart?
I've been waiting for you to call.
You're not alone?
- What about him?
Have you seen him?
Is he there?
Oh, it's Laura.
She came to stay with me for a few days.
Yes, of course.
All right.
We'll talk tomorrow morning.
Good night.
- Why's this in your purse?
- What?
The dentist gave me that for that bad tooth pain, remember?
No, I don't.
Sure you do. This tooth.
I had to use it to kill the pain.
- And it still hurts?
- No, that was a long time ago.
But you carry it around just in case.
I planned to take it back to the dentist.
Ah, that explains everything.
- What are you doing?
- We'll take it back together.
Stop joking! Give me that!
Here.
You might lose it.
Then I'd be in a real mess.
It's so expensive.
Why that look?
You don't think -
I don't think anything, and you're your own boss.
I don't own you.
Who am I, anyway?
Just one guy who passed through your life for a moment.
- You mean "one of the many."
- I didn't say that.
But you thought it.
Yes, I've had lovers.
Of course.
What was I supposed to do?
How do you think I bought all this furniture, my clothes, everything?
With my pay?
It's barely enough for stockings and cigarettes.
I've gotten by like every other woman.
That's life.
- Life is what we want it to be.
Words!
Life is filthy and brutal.
I know what poverty is, and it scares me.
Sure, I could have married a streetcar driver and be starving to death today - me, my children, and him.
Poor Marina.
You think happiness means a fancy apartment, nice clothes, a maid, and rich lovers?
If you'd really loved me, you'd have changed me.
But you're just like all the others - no, worse.
At least they don't preach to me.
You're right. Forgive me.
So you had another fight... for a change.
You were eavesdropping, of course.
No, but I heard.
You hear everything here.
We'll go see Don Pietro tomorrow.
He offered to hide me in a monastery.
No, I could never do that.
I have to work harder than ever now.
She's dead.
I understand.
But you're upset right now.
You might act rashly and do more harm than good.
Don't be afraid that time will run out.
It'll be a long fight.
Our battle's barely begun.
I brought you some aspirin.
Good night.
What?
Maybe Manfredi's right.
We're real dopes.
Be quiet and go to sleep.
- A man's here to see you.
- Show him in.
Come in.
- Hello, Don Pietro.
- I was expecting you.
I prepared your ID card.
"Giovanni Episcopo."
You made me two years younger.
Thanks.
Who's he?
- The Austrian. Didn't Francesco tell you?
A good man.
This gentleman will be coming with us.
Nice to meet you.
I spoke with the prior of the monastery.
He's expecting us.
- Where's Francesco?
In the courtyard with Marcello.
We'd better hurry.
Hand me my...
After you.
I'll be back late.
When will you stop getting mixed up in these things?
You and the boy go right to bed after dinner.
Who can sleep?
Don Pietro?
To feed the boy I'll need...
Oh, right.
Here. That'll be enough.
- You've got nothing left.
- Yes, I do.
Sure you do.
We won't see each other for a little while.
But I'll come back, and we'll always be together.
- Let's go.
- I'm coming.
You might be cold.
Mama gave me this.
Stop! Hands up!
Nobody move!
Get in the car!
Get going!
Go on.
The information was accurate.
Well done.
The information was accurate.
Good girl.
You like it?
Try it on.
Go on, darling.
Magnificent!
Take a look.
- Did they arrest him?
- Yes.
What will they do to him?
Nothing bad.
We need certain information.
Once he provides it, we'll set him free.
- And if he doesn't?
- Don't be silly.
Don't worry.
He'll talk.
- And if he doesn't?
- Why wouldn't he?
You're right.
Why wouldn't he?
- You love him?
- Me?
I don't love anyone.
Why so mean to me tonight?
Let me leave.
No, you're staying here with me.
No, no more! Let me leave!
Why?
What have I done?
What have I done?
What number?
Forty.
Here.
Go on!
Are you hurt?
- My glasses.
- They're broken.
Doesn't matter.
It's all my fault.
They must have been tailing me.
On the contrary.
They've probably been watching me for a long time.
I shouldn't have had you come to the church.
Quiet! The walls have ears.
Let 'em listen.
We have nothing to tell.
Right, Don Pietro?
- Of course.
We have nothing to tell.
Hear that?
We'll scream like that too!
Take it easy.
This was found at the priest's residence, sir.
And these are the prisoners' documents - all forged, of course.
- You searched the priest's rooms?
- Yes, and the sacristy too.
That wasn't smart.
There was only a sexton and a young boy there, sir.
They were so scared that I'm sure they won't talk.
Rest assured, they'll talk.
Thanks.
Straighten up here.
Aren't you afraid?
Yes, very afraid, but I feel very calm too.
Strange, isn't it?
I don't know why, but I -
I understand.
You're both crazy!
Listen to me.
I know you must have something to hide.
Lives depend on your silence.
You think you can withstand their torture.
But you don't know.
They turn even heroes into cowards.
We're not heroes, but they'll never find out anything, I assure you.
- What time is it?
- 8:30, sir.
These men must talk before the curfew is up.
The rebels must not learn of their arrest.
We have ten hours.
Listen, Don Pietro.
I don't know if we'll see each other again, but thanks for all you've done for me, for all of us.
No, let me finish.
I must tell you the truth.
I'm not who you think I am -
Listen.
They're coming.
I beg you, don't betray me!
You!
Krammer, put out the light.
Come in.
Please.
What's your name?
Giovanni Episcopo.
Right.
"Born in Bari. Merchant."
What do you sell?
- Oil and wine.
Oil and wine!
Splendid!
Listen, Mr. Episcopo... if I had time to waste,
I'd love to discuss your business with you.
But I'm pressed for time, and I regard you very highly, so I'll make you an offer.
I know all about you:
Your real name and past political activity.
As for the present,
I know from my informers that you're a leader of the National Liberation Committee and in contact with Badoglio's men.
I absolutely must learn the details of this organization, and you're just the man to tell me about it.
You say you know who I am and my past and present activities.
Then why make this offer?
Think I'd suddenly turn traitor?
I know you've made the same offer, possibly in this very room, to Italian generals -
"Badoglio's men," as you call them.
And I know they paid for their loyalty and silence with their lives.
I hope I prove equal to them.
I'm sorry to see you refuse such a reasonable offer.
But I must say I expected it.
You Italians, no matter your party, have a weakness for rhetoric.
But I'm sure we'll come to an agreement before dawn.
Cigarette?
Come now.
A cigarette won't make you talk.
There are so many strange rumors about the Gestapo.
Krammer, take him away.
Bring in the priest.
You!
Be calm, my son.
Try to pray.
We found these materials in your rooms.
You clearly aim to harm the Reich and its armed forces.
That wasn't exactly my aim.
Then what would you call a man who not only provides refuge and forged documents to Italians plotting attacks on our soldiers but even shelters
German deserters?
A man who humbly seeks to practice charity.
He's a traitor who must punished subject to the military law of the Reich.
God will judge.
Listen to me carefully.
Your friend Episcopo heads a military organization of which you too have detailed knowledge.
If you talk, or persuade your friend to do the same, you'll have merely done your duty as priest and citizen.
I'll tell you why.
These men plotting to sabotage
German armed forces are violating the rights of an occupying power guaranteed by international treaties.
They are therefore defectors subject to military justice.
Is that clear?
Your words have moved me deeply.
Finally!
Krammer... take his statement.
- There's just one problem.
- What?
Personally I have nothing to say.
I know nothing.
What little I know
I learned in the confessional, and those secrets must die with me.
It's our vow.
I'm not interested in your vow!
But someone else is, someone higher than you... and me.
Then persuade your friend to talk.
I don't think he has the information you seek.
You'd have me believe that you don't know what he really does, who he really is?
I only know he's a man in need of my modest help.
Really?
Then I'll tell you who he is.
He's a subversive, an atheist - your enemy!
I am a Catholic priest.
I believe that anyone fighting for justice and liberty walks in the ways of the Lord, and the ways of the Lord are infinite.
I hope you're not going to preach to me!
That's not my intention.
I have no time to lose.
Do you refuse to talk?
And you won't even try to persuade your companion?
You could save him from suffering that you can't even imagine.
I can imagine it far better than you think.
But there'd be no point.
And if he is who you say, he wouldn't be easily persuaded, would he?
Don't worry. He'll talk.
I don't think so.
He won't talk.
- Really?
- He won't talk.
I'll pray for him.
You won't get much credit for that from your heavenly father!
This will take a while.
Come get me as soon as there's any news.
Come in.
The deserter hanged himself, sir.
That idiot!
- Who's winning?
- Same as always.
- Strenuous evening?
- Not very... but interesting.
Really? How so?
I have a fellow who must talk before morning, and an Italian priest who claims the fellow won't because he's praying for him.
- And if he doesn't talk?
- Ridiculous.
If he won't talk no matter what?
That would mean an Italian is as good as a German... that there's no difference between the blood of a slave race and that of a master race.
What would be the sense of our struggle?
Twenty-five years ago
I led execution squads in France.
I was a young officer then... and I too believed that we Germans were a master race.
But the French patriots chose to die rather than talk.
We Germans refuse to realize that people want to be free.
- Hartmann, you're drunk!
- Yes, I am.
I drink every night to forget.
But instead
I see more and more clearly.
All we're really good at is killing, killing, killing!
We've strewn all of Europe with corpses, and from their graves rises up an unquenchable hatred.
Hatred... hatred everywhere!
That hatred will devour us.
There's no hope.
Enough!
We'll all die without the slightest hope.
I forbid you to continue!
Without hope.
You hear me?
You forget that you are a German officer!
- Did he talk?
- No, sir.
Wendel says he's never seen one so stubborn.
The man's gone completely numb.
What should we do now, sir?
- Well?
- It's impossible, sir.
We have to let him regain some strength.
Impossible!
It's too late for that.
Shall we try psychological methods, sir?
Are you crazy?
He must talk now.
Syringe.
Mr. Ferraris, as I said before,
I admire you greatly, and I do appreciate this proof of your courage and spirit of sacrifice.
But you must understand:
This can't go on.
You are a Communist.
Your party has formed a pact with reactionary forces.
You're all working together against us now.
But tomorrow, when Rome is occupied - or "liberated," as you call it - will these monarchist officers still be your allies?
I offer you the solution to this problem.
Give me the names of Badoglio's generals.
Help me arrest them, and I guarantee your release and immunity for the men in your party.
Well, Mr. Ferraris?
Cursed dog!
Keep at him till the end!
How's it going?
I told you it wouldn't be so easy.
A cigarette.
The priest, quick!
Look, priest! Satisfied now?
This is your Christian charity.
This is your love for your brother in Christ.
You preferred to see him like this rather than talk.
But don't think you'll save yourself, you hypocrite, or your accomplices either.
You'll die a traitor's death.
We'll destroy you all, to the last man!
You didn't talk.
It is finished.
You tried to destroy his soul, but you only destroyed his body!
Curse you all!
Curse you all!
You'll be trampled in the dust like worms!
Curse you all!
My God... what have I said?
Forgive me, Lord.
Out!
Take the priest back!
Everybody out, now!
Stupid Italians!
Damn it! We failed.
That damned priest got me flustered.
I told you it wouldn't be easy.
You're always right.
The report, sir?
Ah, yes. "Cause of death:
Heart attack."
Yes, sir.
And the young woman?
That's up to the lady.
Lock her up a while and then -
Come, my dear.
I need a stiff drink.
Sir, what name shall I put down?
Manfredi or Ferraris?
Giovanni Episcopo.
Else we create another martyr, and they already have plenty.
Just a moment.
For next time.
We are a master race...
- What time do you have?
- Exactly. They're late.
- Yes.
- Cigarette?
- Thanks.
A match.
Positions!
Get ready.
Attention!
Your hat.
Come. Be brave.
Oh, it's not hard to die a good death.
What's hard is to live a good life.
Fire!
God, forgive them...
End this now!
- Code message, sir.
- Thanks.
- Harper, code message.
- Yes, sir.
All right, everything clear to the pilots?
- Major Roberts.
- Yes, Quincannon?
- Gonna use the radio beam all the way?
- Yes.
Flight leaders will work Hickam radio control...
...while the other planes work the home station. How about the navigators?
- One question, sir.
- How soon...?
- Sorry.
- Hauser?
How soon will we get our maps and charts, sir?
Anytime you want them. You'll be given the route weather forecast soon.
- Wendell?
- That's what I wanted to know, sir.
Any questions from the bombardiers?
- Major Roberts, sir.
- Parker.
- What about ammunition?
- No ammunition.
- Yes, McMartin?
- Are we taking bombsights along?
We're ferrying them fully equipped except for ammunition.
Maintenance crews are working on them.
Pilots, check with them to be sure everything's in shape.
- And Harper, you'll check for us.
- Yes, sir.
I guess that's all for now.
Oh, yes. The crews haven't been told yet what the destination is, so keep it quiet.
- Anything else?
- How about phoning our wives, sir?
Evidently your copilot doesn't take you into his confidence.
He got permission to send a radiogram to Lieutenant McMartin's sister in Honolulu.
I thought that might interest you,
McMartin.
- Yes, sir.
- Well, I guess that's about all.
We'll meet here 30 minutes before takeoff time for final instructions.
- How's everything, sergeant?
- Everything's going fine, sir.
Gotta put a new magneto on number two.
Gear's shot.
They told me to get her ready for a long trip.
- They didn't tell me where.
- They didn't, huh?
- No, sir.
- Can you keep a secret, sergeant?
- Yes, sir.
- That's good.
Captain Quincannon?
Private Chester reporting, sir.
Second radio.
Sergeant White, your crew chief.
- How are you?
- How do you do?
- Glad to have you with us.
- I'm glad to be assigned to your airplane.
I've been hoping to get on a Flying Fortress since radio school.
- How long ago was that?
- Three months ago.
I've had experience.
I've been in light bombers.
That's fine.
Better turn him over to Peterson, sergeant.
He can look over the radio set and get the hang of things.
- I'll be in Operations if you want me.
- Yes, sir.
You'll find Peterson inside, son.
- Must be a big flight. Nine Fortresses.
- So they say.
Do you know...?
I mean, can you tell me where we're going?
- Can... Can you keep a secret?
- Oh, yes, sir.
That's good.
- Hello.
- Hello. Are you the new gunner?
- No, second radio.
- Yeah?
- My name's Weinberg, second engineer.
- Chester's my name. Glad to know you.
- Glad to know you.
- Hey, is that what they call her, Mary-Ann?
That's her.
And she's the best ship in the outfit.
Hey, Peterson, here's your new static chaser.
- My name's Chester.
- How are you?
Come on, I'll show you around.
- Hey, you the crew chief?
- Yeah.
My name's White.
Are you the new gunner?
Yeah, Winocki. Joe Winocki.
We've been expecting you.
Put your stuff inside.
- Okay.
- You're lucky.
- Our regular gunner's on furlough.
- I wouldn't say I'm lucky.
- Looks like everything's okay, sergeant.
- I think so, sir.
- How about coffee and sandwiches?
- Got them, sir.
- I wish we could get ahold of extra oxygen.
- Already inside the plane, sir.
- How'd you do that?
- Six bottles.
- You haven't got an extra engine, have you?
- Almost enough parts to build one, I guess.
I'm getting sort of worried about my wife.
She should be here by now.
Oh, Winocki.
- Yeah?
- This is our new gunner, sir.
Captain Quincannon.
- Don't I know you, sergeant?
- I think you do, sir.
- You were at Randolph Field?
- That's right.
- About two years ago?
- Two and a half, sir.
- While I was instructing there.
- That's right.
- Oh, I remem...
- I think you remember.
- Anything else, sir?
- Not now, no.
Anyhow, I guess that new radioman of ours is a pretty good kid.
- Yeah, I guess he is.
- We're getting them right off the bottle.
We were all pretty young when we started out.
How old is that kid of yours you talk about?
- Twenty-one.
- Where is he stationed?
Clark Field, Manila.
They got him in one of those Peashooters.
Just got a boost too.
If he gets another bar on his shoulders, you're gonna have to have a bigger head.
- Imagine me saluting my own kid.
- You'd pin his ears down if he didn't take it.
Excuse me, sir. Would you mind if...?
Well, my mother would like to meet you.
Sure.
Mother, this is Captain Quincannon.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Mighty nice of you to turn out at this time of night to see us off.
I wanted to meet you, captain, because...
...well, I couldn't help wondering what kind of a...
- You'll take good care of him, won't you?
- In a way, he'll be looking after me.
That's the way the crew of a bomber functions.
- I wouldn't worry any.
- I won't.
We haven't much time left, Chester.
Don't worry about our radioman.
It's a routine flight.
- He'll be back in a couple of weeks.
- Thank you.
- Goodbye, Mrs. Chester.
- Goodbye.
I'll write to you, Mom, so you'll know where I am.
Did you bring this for me?
Take care of yourself, Mom.
Don't worry about me. I'll be all right.
Goodbye, son.
Goodbye, Mom.
Haven't seen Mrs. Quincannon, have you?
- I haven't. I've been watching, sir.
- Well, I guess I've been ditched.
- You better get aboard, Chester.
- Yes, sir.
Irish!
- Irish.
- It's about time, Mrs. Quincannon.
- Did you have another date?
- Flat tire. You ever try to get a taxi here?
- I was scared I wouldn't make it.
- So was I.
And I couldn't bring Michael. It's a little too late for him, but he sent you this.
And this.
Thanks.
- Darling, couldn't I stow away?
- Do you wanna get me court-martialed?
I'll be back in a couple weeks.
We'll take time off for that honeymoon.
I remember every honeymoon we didn't have. Even the first one.
So do I.
You haven't got much chance to be bored with me.
Oh, I'll never get bored with you, Irish.
It's been fun, every minute of it.
Such good fun.
- I guess I'm just lucky.
- Me too.
Irish, when you go out in the rain, you'll remember to wear your rubbers, won't you?
Sure, I will.
I'll be waiting.
So long, kid.
- Better stow this stuff over there, sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
Excuse me, sir.
- Get that ladder aboard, will you, Weinberg?
- Okay.
- Hey, what's that thing for?
- You never know where your luck is.
That's from
Michael Aloysius Quincannon, Jr.
- Everybody in?
- Yes, sir.
- Doors closed?
- Yes, sir.
- Lockpins out?
- Yes, sir.
- Check controls for free movement.
- Check.
- Roberts to flight, check-in in order.
- Two ready.
- Three okay.
- Four okay.
- Five okay.
- Eight ready.
- Nine okay.
- Okay, start engines.
All set here, sir.
- Only need one shot, sir. Kind of warm.
- Okay.
Number one.
Number two.
01104 to control tower.
Take-off instructions for flight of nine B-17s.
- Sir, is this a local flight?
- No, this is not a local flight.
Okay to taxi up to north end of ramp.
Use runway two-eight.
Wind west, one-five. Go ahead.
Roger.
Roberts to flight, all planes follow me.
Use runway 28. Wind west, 15 miles.
Take off at 30-second intervals.
Let's go.
- Looks like they're gonna run all right.
- Thank you, sir.
- Check the tail wheel, will you, Robbie?
- Yes, sir.
- I'm going upstairs.
- Okay, Tommy.
Don't get us lost.
Want any help running this thing?
- Hi, Tommy. How's Monk doing?
- Knee-deep in maps.
Well, looks like you got your date, all right.
They say that Hawaiian moon's awful big.
Better watch out, Tommy, or he'll be your brother-in-law.
No, Susan's a smart girl.
She won't marry beneath herself.
Go on, you can't make me mad.
Take a last look.
- Goodbye, San Francisco.
- Hello, Honolulu.
Hey, there's the Golden Gate.
Christmas crackers.
That's an awful big town, San Francisco.
Strictly a one-whistle stop.
There's only one city in the U.S.A.
And that's New York.
Oh, you're just another hometown hick,
Weinberg.
- What's wrong with California?
- California?
The sun shines and nothing ever happens.
Before you know it you're 60 years old.
It's no different from New York.
My sister's been trying to get out of Brooklyn for 40 years.
Brooklyn? That ain't New York.
Once you cross that Brooklyn Bridge, you're out of this world.
The only noise you hear is the hardening of your arteries.
When I used to drive a hack...
...I had a pal who crossed that bridge back in 1929.
- I ain't heard from him since.
- Me, I'll take Minneapolis.
Minneapolis?
Why, the grass still grows in the streets.
Besides, that ain't your hometown,
Peterson.
The hayseed's still sticking out of your hair.
Yeah, but I can still milk a cow.
I bet you can't.
I'll get mine out of a bottle. That's the closest I ever wanna be to a cow.
You're handy with the old bull.
Gee. Gee, we're sure lucky.
- Why? What do you mean?
- Oh, this whole trip.
Well, what about it?
Oh, a million fellas would give anything to be in our shoes right now.
Why?
I don't mean just this flight.
I mean, well...
Everything we've got to look forward to.
How far do you think you'll get as an enlisted man?
A lot of enlisted men get commissions.
Look at the training you get, and the experience too.
Look, if you don't go through flying school, you don't rate.
- I don't believe that.
- I know.
- Well, what are you in it for?
- Not for long.
I've had enough.
I'm getting out next month.
- You're getting out, huh?
- Yup.
- Well, I'm not.
- That's right, stay with it.
You stick to what you believe in, kid.
Don't listen to guys like him.
What are you gonna be in another 20 years, sergeant? A brigadier?
No. But my boy is.
Him and me sort of like the old Air Corps.
You stay in the box, son, and keep right on pitching.
Yeah.
Coming up forward, kid?
Yeah. Keep right on pitching.
- Everybody all right?
- Fine, sir.
- Good.
- Coffee, captain?
Yeah, please.
- Thanks, sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
- You want some coffee, Winocki?
- No, thanks.
- How's it going?
- All right, sir.
- I want to talk with you.
- Sure. Can I talk too?
Sure, go ahead. Get it off your chest.
- I want to get things straight with you.
- I think I'm straight.
- I don't know if you are, sir.
- I think I know what's bothering you.
- Do you?
- Yeah. And in a way, I don't blame you.
- You wanted to fly, be a pilot, didn't you?
- Who doesn't?
- You had your chance.
- Did I?
- Yeah. You blew it.
- That's what you think.
You couldn't make it. You scraped around a while. When the going got tough...
Yeah, and you threw me up for grabs.
I didn't run you into Driscoll's plane and cut his tail off.
- Oh, I know it was an accident, but...
- For which you washed me out of school.
I could have been flying one of these if it hadn't been for that.
I didn't wash you out, the board washed you out.
- On your recommendation.
- You lacked flying ability.
You should have been eliminated sooner.
I want you to know that nobody held you responsible for Driscoll's death.
- Except you, sir.
- Not me either.
Get that out of your head.
Now, look, Winocki...
...there are two other men on this ship who washed out as pilots.
McMartin's a bombardier, Hauser went in for navigation. They're both good.
You're a good gunner or you wouldn't have the rating.
We need you like we need the whole gang.
It takes all of us to make this ship function.
Now, get this into your head:
We all belong to this airplane.
Every man has got to rely on every other man to do the right thing at the right time.
You played football, Winocki.
You know how one man can gum up the whole works.
You gotta play ball with us, play the game, or I'm gonna get rid of you.
Nice speech.
But my enlistment runs out in three weeks.
- You're quitting, huh?
- Yes, sir.
Well, that's your privilege.
But until that time, you're still in the Army.
Don't you forget it.
- Yes, sir.
- I'm sorry for you, Winocki.
- Anything else, sir?
- No, that's all.
Oh, Peterson, if you want entertainment, tune in on the broadcast frequencies.
- I'll stay on the command set.
- Yes, sir. Thank you.
San Francisco. Mr. Litvinoff, the new
Russian ambassador to the United States...
... arrived yesterday
on the China Clipper...
... and departed immediately for the capital
to confer with the president.
Washington, D.C.
Tension in the Pacific and the Far East
has relaxed...
... as a result of the peaceful mission of
Japan's special envoy, Mr. Saburo Kurusu.
Mr. Kurusu and Admiral Nomura
have assured the press...
... that Japan's intentions
are wholly peaceful.
They will meet again tomorrow
with Secretary of State Cordell Hull.
Seattle, Washington.
A final labor conference
was held here this morning...
Weather report from Hickam Field, sir.
- Did you get a good sleep, Chester?
- Not much, sir.
I didn't wanna miss anything.
- How's the kid doing, sergeant?
- Fine, sir.
He likes the ship and I guess Mary-Ann likes him.
Good. How about Winocki?
I can't make him out.
No, sir.
Thanks, Chester.
Beg pardon, sir. Isn't that a picture of Captain Monk Hauser?
Yeah.
- Well, that's...
- My father.
Gosh, I'm pretty dumb.
I should have realized.
- Well, there's not much resemblance.
- Oh, sure there is. I can see it now.
I've seen him in a book I got about the Lafayette Escadrille.
- Yeah, he was in it.
- Yeah, he sure was.
- Gee, he could sure fly.
- Yeah.
I wish I could fly like him.
Yes, sir.
Well, it won't be long now before you see Diamond Head...
...sticking out of that ocean.
Suits Weinberg.
I used to dream about getting out of traffic jams...
...and going someplace where a guy would have elbow room.
But this is overdoing it.
Two thousand miles and I ain't seen a fish.
I kind of like it.
- Like being on the prairies when I was a kid.
- Funny thing.
I never thought there was nothing west of Manhattan except Jersey.
- I can use some of that coffee.
- I was just talking to the navigator.
- You know who his father was?
- Sure. Monk Hauser.
- Who's that?
- How old were you in the last war?
Older than you.
I was over on the other side.
And you never heard of Monk Hauser with Eddie Rickenbacker's squadron?
Well, what do you know?
Was that Lieutenant Hauser's old man?
That's him. I knew him. He was plenty good till they knocked him down.
Yeah, he sure was.
- Well, why ain't this kid of his a pilot?
- Tried too hard.
Yeah, like a lot of others.
- That's funny.
- What?
Hickam radio went off right in the middle of a weather report.
- Maybe it faded out.
- It didn't sound like it.
- What is it? What is it?
- Wait.
Hey, Peterson, who you got tuned in,
Orson Welles?
- Shut up.
- Now...
Shut up.
Better tell the captain.
Radio operator to pilot.
Radio operator to pilot.
- Go ahead.
- Sir, Hickam Field's off the air.
I don't know what I've picked up.
You can listen in on R-2.
- What's that?
- I don't know.
- Chinese?
- No, Japs.
Number four to Major Roberts.
Number four to Major Roberts.
Stand by, Irish. I hear it.
Keep off the air.
01104 to Hickam radio.
01104 to Hickam radio.
Hickam radio, answer.
Hickam radio, answer, please.
01104 to Hickam radio.
A flight of B- 17s to Hickam
want landing instructions.
Hickam radio, answer, please.
Give me landing instructions
for a flight of B- 17s.
Hickam radio, give me a call, please.
01104 to Hickam radio.
Silence your radio!
Keep away from the field!
We're being attacked by enemy aircraft.
We're being attacked by enemy aircraft.
Land elsewhere. Land elsewhere.
Roberts to flight.
We're going into emergency fields.
You know where they are.
I'll take the one furthest north, number nine, furthest south...
...the rest of you, in between.
Get on the ground and stay there till you're clear.
You're on your own.
Peterson, send the crew chief up here right away.
Get the rubber boats ready.
Pass out.45s and ammunition.
- Where do we go, Monk?
- Turn 120 degrees until I figure it out.
Okay, 120 degrees she is.
- I wish we were there.
- Yeah.
- If we only had machine-gun loads.
- I still got a throwing arm.
I'll heave a wrench if any of them come our way.
Get the rubber boats ready.
- Pass out side arms.
- I've done that.
- Tell everybody to keep their eyes open.
- Yes, sir.
Put your life vests on.
Keep an eye out upstairs, kid.
- Put your life vests on, boys.
- Hey, sarge, is this really on the level?
You guess.
Winocki,
I told you to put your life vest on.
Relax, sergeant.
This is some kind of drill, and you know it.
Personally, I wouldn't care if you left it off. Here.
Thanks, brigadier.
- Navigator to pilot.
- Go ahead.
Change course to 135. We ought to be on the ground at Maui in 22 minutes.
Right, 135.
This one really is smaller than a postage stamp.
Little more. That's about it.
- Looks like it here.
- Hold it there.
- Think it'll work, sergeant?
- It'll hold all right, sir.
- We gotta see if she'll retract.
- Because I made a mess out of the landing.
A wonder you got her in at all, sir.
This field wasn't built for the Mary-Ann.
Hey, captain, something's moving over there in the brush.
Why, it's the lieutenants.
- You fellas look like you've had a trip.
- We did.
- Yeah, where's the water?
- Right here.
- You find the other field?
- Yeah, but no ammunition.
- How many of our flight there?
- Two. Both of them okay.
- Hi, there, Tommy.
- Hi.
- That accounts for everybody.
- Yeah.
Two more landed at Molokai, and Roberts and the rest made Hickam.
- Cracked-up landing. Nobody was hurt.
- What have you heard?
- Nothing since noon.
- Sound bad at Hickam?
Doesn't sound good.
We had a little trouble ourselves on the way back.
- What?
- Somebody took a crack at us.
- What do you mean?
- Just that.
We saw men in a cane field and headed for them.
- They started popping away with rifles.
- Local Japs. Friendly fellas.
We lost them back there, three or four miles.
I hope you did.
- Better get back to your bombsight, Tommy.
- Yeah.
Step on it, sergeant.
- Douse that light! Let's get out of here!
- Knock those wedges out.
Winocki, cut it out.
Knock this one out first.
Got this one.
- All right, shove!
- Shove.
Everybody in the ship!
- How do we get out of this chicken yard?
- We got in, didn't we?
Hey, they ain't kidding.
Did you see that bumblebee?
- Lock it.
- Locked.
Check the tanks and see if they've been hit.
Yes, sir.
All right, all right. Let me alone.
- All right, all right.
- How are you feeling, Winocki?
- I owe you one for this.
- Yeah?
How far do you think you'd have gotten in that brush?
They'd have cut you down before you got to first base.
- Instead, you did it.
- Don't you know this is just a drill?
We could've had a fine scrap with them snipers.
Couple of shots in the right place could have set this ship afire.
Use your head, Winocki, and stop trying to prove something.
My job is tail gunner.
What's yours, lecturing?
No. My job is to keep this thing flying.
05564 to Hickam Field.
05564 to Hickam Field.
Shut off your radio. Stay where you are.
Don't get off the ground.
05564 to Hickam.
Just cleared emergency field on Maui.
- Have to come down.
- Okay.
- Give me a call just before you come in.
- Roger.
Pilot to crew.
Take a good look at Pearl Harbor.
Maybe it's something you'll want to remember.
Damn them. Damn them.
Now ain't you glad you're getting out of the Army?
05564 to Hickam.
- Go ahead.
- Approaching the field from the south.
- Coming in for a landing.
- We won't be able to give you any lights.
- I can get in without them.
- Take the west side near the hangars.
Watch out for bomb craters on the runway.
- Good luck to you.
- Roger.
Pilot to crew. Fasten your safety belts.
- Might be a rough landing.
- All set, sir.
All checked for landing.
- Give me full flaps.
- Flaps coming down.
- Landing lights.
- Lights.
Air speed 110.
One hundred.
- Captain Quincannon, sir.
- How are you, captain?
You made a good landing.
You were told to stay where you were.
- Yes, but we had to get out.
- Why?
- We were being shot at by snipers.
- At Maui?
- We didn't wanna lose the airplane.
- No, no, of course you didn't.
Didn't know about that.
You did the right thing, then.
Well, we've had our troubles around here too, as you can see.
Yes, sir.
They certainly did a complete job of it.
What happened to those P-40s?
Three trucks arrived from Honolulu this morning.
When the first Jap plane showed up, the trucks went down the field...
...smashed the tails off every ship on the land.
They sure had a field day.
Took the first round, but there'll be others.
- Yes, sir.
- Which one of you is McMartin?
- Me, sir.
- I have some bad news for you.
- You're wanted over at the hospital.
- My sister?
Sorry, I didn't get any details except that she asked for Williams and Quincannon too.
Captain, we'll want your ship serviced right away.
- Full gas load, ammunition for guns.
- Yes, sir.
Any repairs needed?
There's a wheel to be checked.
Everything else seems okay.
These men will give you everything.
- Sergeant?
- Yes, sir?
You heard what the colonel said.
Anything else?
- This car will take you to the hospital.
- Thank you.
- Who's your navigator?
- I am, sir.
- Come with me. I have a job for you.
- Oh, colonel.
Beg your pardon, sir.
- Glad to see you again, sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.
Did they attack Clark Field, Manila, sir?
- I've got a boy there.
- Yes, they hit it all right.
Hit everything in the Pacific.
Guam, Wake, Midway.
I remember your boy, sergeant.
- Twenty-seventh group.
- Yes, sir.
He's a first lieutenant now.
Flight commander.
He's a good pilot, then.
Don't worry. He'll take care of himself.
Thank you, sir. All right, fellas.
We got a job of work to do.
Let's get with it.
- Miss McMartin?
- Right down that way.
Thank you.
I can't see. Why is it so dark?
Hush, child. It's going to be all right.
But I can't see.
I can't see.
- Lieutenant McMartin?
- Yes, nurse.
You can only stay a few minutes.
She needs all the rest she can get.
Sure.
Sue.
Hello, kids.
Why, it's good to see you boys.
I was kind of scared.
I acted like a ninny.
We didn't know whether you had a flat tire or something...
...or couldn't find the place.
Or...
Tommy, Bill, I'm so glad you're here.
- Kind of hurts when I cry.
- Don't, Sue.
I wanted to tell you about...
But I guess I'm kind of tired.
- He'll tell you.
- Who?
Tex.
- Tex Rader.
- What?
Please don't get mad at him.
It was all my fault.
He tried to make me get out of the car, but...
- I guess he'd better tell you.
- Sure.
- Will you come in the morning?
- You bet.
Good night.
Sergeant, do you know where we can find Lieutenant Rader?
Yes, sir. Right this way.
Rader. Rader.
Oh, hello, Tommy.
- Quincannon. How are you, Bill?
- I've been waiting for you. I went to sleep.
We just came from the hospital.
- How is she?
- Not so good.
That's what we came to talk to you about.
- Suppose you do a little explaining.
- Yeah, go on, start.
- Say, what is this, the third degree?
- All right, she said it wasn't his fault.
Don't believe what she said.
It was my fault.
- Should've made her get out of the car.
- What car?
- The one I borrowed for the party.
- What party?
Give him a chance.
We were starting out when the first planes came.
- Couldn't figure it out.
- Up early, weren't you?
- Or out late.
- Listen, will you?
- Say, I don't get...
- Never mind, Rader. Go ahead.
We spotted the planes, and at the same time heard the bombs.
All I could think of was getting to the field.
I told Susan to hop out and get under cover, but she only laughed at me.
- You know how she is.
- Yeah, we know. Go on.
We got near the field, a truck pulled across, blocking the road ahead of us.
It was a delivery truck from Honolulu.
I remember thinking as I jumped out that the driver had been hit.
I was just dumb.
First thing I knew, there was an explosion right in my face.
There was a Jap behind the wheel with a shotgun.
It was a rotten shot. Sloughed him over the head with his own gun.
Got the truck off the road.
Other cars were coming along, trying to get to the field.
Was Susan all right then?
Yeah, but that's when
I should've made her get out.
She took the wheel and went carting off toward the hangars with me hanging on.
Last time I saw her, she was standing up in the car...
...yelling and rooting like she was at a football game.
- How'd she get hurt, then?
- Machine gun.
The soldier who ran out to drag her in was killed.
- What were you doing all that time?
- What do you think?
I notice you're not hurt any.
- Listen, wait a minute.
- Wait a minute, Tommy.
If I stay here, I'll...
Let's go.
- Say, you guys don't think...?
- See you later, Rader.
You wanted to see me, colonel?
- You find something to eat?
- Yes.
- How's your sister, McMartin?
- Pretty weak, sir.
The surgeon says it's hard to tell yet.
I'm going over again when he makes another examination.
No, you aren't. We want this airplane out of here before daylight.
- You're sending us back to the mainland?
- No, Manila.
We're safe here for the moment, and the Philippines are in bad shape.
Our orders are to send them as many B-17s as we can. Can you make it?
- Where do we stop to refuel, sir?
- Wake Island.
I can't promise you how long it'll hold out or what you'll find there.
- Got the charts there, Monk?
- Yes, sir.
- Sergeant White.
- Yes, sir?
- How'd the engines rev up, sergeant?
- Number-three engine's a little rough, sir.
The men are pretty tired.
We'll overhaul it in the morning.
- We're taking off in two hours.
- Sir?
I think you're gonna see that son of yours soon.
- Manila?
- Can you get that engine running?
We'll have her hitting home runs in 90 minutes.
Tell the crew they can sleep in the next world.
- We'll make it all right, sir.
- Good luck. Take off when you're ready.
By the way, tell your passenger
I'll have some papers for him.
- What passenger, sir?
- Hasn't he reported yet?
- Manila needs pilots. You're taking one.
- Who, sir?
Lieutenant Rader.
- Did you say Rader?
- Yes, and he's a good man too.
Three fighters got off the ground this morning, and he was one.
Knocked off four Jap Zeros before they shot him down.
He'll be recommended for a DFC.
Well, good luck again.
Thank you, sir.
Well...
...looks like you two fellas talked out of turn a while ago.
Maybe you better go and rustle up some grub for the crew.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
- Java, lieutenant?
- No, I've been living on it.
You fellas must have a plantation in Brazil.
I'll leave it here.
Maybe you'll want some later on.
- Is this here Wake Island?
- Yeah.
- How far is it?
- Oh, it's about 2300 miles from Honolulu.
- And we're gonna land on that dot?
- Yeah. It's not very big, is it?
Like trying to find a buckshot in Central Park.
Gee, I wish there were some traffic signs around.
- There are, but you can't see them.
- I mean like numbers and streets.
Yeah, but I call them latitudes and longitudes.
- And they're just like signs, huh?
- Yeah, if the wind doesn't change them.
Say, lieutenant, how we doing?
Now, look, you're the fifth guy that's been down here asking that.
- We'll hit Wake all right.
- Yes, sir.
I was just asking.
- Time to relieve the kid, Minnesota.
- Okay.
You want anything, lieutenant?
Yeah, I'd like to get out of this flying boxcar.
Sure a long way to Manila.
Mary-Ann ain't no boxcar, sir.
She's a good airplane.
- Mary-Ann?
- That's what we call her.
There ain't a better airplane in the Army.
- Maybe, if you're talking about bombers.
- Any airplane, sir.
- I'll take a pursuit ship for mine, sergeant.
- Well, you can take pursuit and...
Yes, sir.
Oh, chief, that's my last apple.
I'm saving it.
Don't leave it laying around, then.
There's a pursuit pilot back there.
Morning, sir. How we doing?
You too? Every 15 minutes, somebody wakes up and comes here to find out...
...if I know where we are or if I'm gonna get this airplane lost. I'm getting sick...
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, I'm sorry, sergeant.
- I guess I'm a little on edge.
- Oh, that's all right, sir.
That's the way your old man would've told me off.
Except he'd have done it with a four-star cussing.
- Yeah, I guess he would.
- Tell me, sir, how are we doing?
We're all right. I think we're gonna hit Wake right on the nose.
Sure we will, sir.
Say, chief, what happens if the Japs have took Wake Island before we get there?
I wish you'd learn to control that imagination of yours.
- I was just asking.
- Don't you know we're not at war?
- Ain't we in the war yet?
- Hasn't been declared.
- I don't get it.
- Them Japs.
They smear Pearl Harbor, smack Manila, raid Wake, Guam and Midway...
...and still there ain't no war.
They send a couple of oily gents to Washington...
...with a olive wreath for the president...
...while the boys back home slough
Uncle Sam over the head with a crowbar.
Your Uncle Sam is a pretty tough old gentleman.
You just wait till he gets mad.
I hope you don't mind if I get slightly annoyed in the meantime.
- No. But I didn't expect it of you.
- I still don't get it.
Message coming through, sir.
And good news.
Thanks, Peterson.
Hey, you guys, take a look at this.
That's wonderful.
If the head surgeon says that, she must be okay.
- Sure she is.
- Boy, I feel a lot better.
Oh, me too.
It was mighty swell of the CO to think of sending this.
Better show it to our passenger.
Poor guy must be worrying.
- Let him worry. He's got it coming.
- You're being a little tough with Rader.
- I haven't kicked him in the face yet.
- You couldn't be jealous, could you, Bill?
Well, maybe I am.
Peterson, ask Lieutenant Rader to come up front, will you?
That's the stuff.
Now, look, stay out of arguments.
- We never...
- You can't outtalk that guy.
He's been shooting off his face against big airplanes since they gave him wings.
But he doesn't know any better.
Just quit arguing.
- You'll be a lot better off.
- Okay, captain.
- Somebody up here wanna see me?
- Yeah.
- We got some good news for you, Tex.
- Yeah?
Boy, that is good news.
She's a swell kid.
You know, Tex, we were all pretty upset last night.
If we said anything out of line...
Oh, forget it, I know how you felt.
I don't blame you.
Thanks, Tex. After all, we've known each other a long time.
We've had our arguments about these big bombers and your Peashooters, but...
Forget it, Tommy.
Just a matter of opinion.
You know, Tex, we were wondering, what was it like yesterday at Hickam?
- Oh, an awful mess. We just weren't ready.
- How good are those Japs?
They're pretty good when they got the edge, 10 or 12 to one.
They don't like an even fight.
Every time you get one alone, he lights out like a scared sage hen.
- We heard you did a swell job.
- Thanks.
Hope you get a decoration.
I'd still like to know how all their carriers got away.
We didn't even get a bomber off.
- Caught them on the ground.
- You make it sound like the bombers' fault.
Okay, you two, quit it.
You guys are awful touchy about these crates.
- Oh, it's not that...
- Hold it.
- Go ahead, Monk.
- The wind shifted again.
Give me three degrees to the left.
You'd better make it 2.44.
Okay, two-four-four.
- That's the new flight control?
- You know the old type?
- Yeah.
- Well, this is a whole lot better.
Why don't you fly her and find out what a B-17 will do?
Oh, no, not me. Looks to me like she's flying herself anyway.
Well, she is right now, yeah.
She seems to be getting us there, not very fast though.
She'll out-fly your pursuit ships up high.
- Will she?
- Yeah, she will.
- You can't sell me.
- What'll a P-40 do at 30,000?
- We'd have to tow it to get it up there.
- We'd run away and hide on you.
- Well, that's all you could do.
- Oh, sure, no arguments.
If you guys will give me a chance,
I'll prove something.
- All right, go ahead.
- Three minutes and no interruptions.
- Anything to get this settled.
- Let him talk.
Irish, the navigator gave you a course.
You reach down and turn a knob and you're on it, right?
Tommy, that gadget there is almost as good as your bombsight, isn't it?
- Well, not quite...
- Well, almost.
- And you call the sight the brain, don't you?
- Yeah.
- Then this is a sort of mechanical brain too.
- It does everything but think.
It seems to be doing the thinking right now.
- Well, I don't...
- Watch out for him.
- Did you hear about it too?
- Hear what?
- I got it pretty straight.
- What?
Why, they're gonna give commissions to these mechanical brains in bombers.
Put them in uniform and teach them to talk, turn out bomber pilots on the assembly line.
We pursuit pilots will be upstairs fighting.
We'll look down and see a flock of these freight trains coming.
Press a button: "Lieutenant."
"Yes, sir?" says that thing.
"Drop a load of potatoes on the enemy."
"I'll tell Captain Bombsight right away."
"Very well. Where's your pilot?"
"We left him on the ground.
We don't need them.
Their heads take up too much room."
- Very funny.
- Did you ever think...?
- Keep them quiet, Irish.
- Shut up, you guys. Give him a chance.
Now, seriously, guys, these big crates are all right.
I just don't wanna fight in any airplane that more than one man can ride in.
I don't wanna be responsible for eight or 10 guys.
Or depending on them, the way you're on Hauser now.
What do you mean, depending on him?
In a pursuit ship, you're a one-man army, not a taxi driver.
You're on your own.
You don't wait for orders from a guy who can't fly, a bombardier.
Hey, that's enough.
You give orders to these taxi drivers when you go to lay eggs.
"Where to?" says the Irishman.
You say, "Go a few blocks and turn right.
Give me change for a nickel, conductor."
When you get to 33rd and Broadway, throw an egg out the window and run.
Very exciting. I wouldn't fly this crate if they made me a brigadier for it.
Bill, pipe down. Shut up, Rader.
Go ahead, Peterson.
I've picked up Washington on the short wave, sir.
- The president's on.
- Thanks.
Washington's on short wave.
Get below and grab some headphones.
Yeah, and take that pursuit pilot with you.
- Do I have to?
- Take him.
- Come on, lone eagle.
- Drop him out if you get a chance.
The attack yesterday...
... on the Hawaiian Islands...
... has caused severe damage
to American naval and military forces.
I regret to tell you that
very many American lives have been lost.
But always will our whole nation...
... remember the character
of the onslaught against us.
I hope he tells us something about the Philippines.
My boy's at Clark Field.
No matter how long it may take us...
... to overcome
this premeditated invasion...
... the American people,
in their righteous might...
... will win through to absolute victory.
We will not only defend ourselves
to the uttermost...
...but will make it very certain...
... that this form of treachery
shall never again endanger us.
With confidence in our armed forces...
... with the unbounding determination
of our people...
... we will gain the inevitable triumph...
... so help us God.
I ask that the Congress declare...
... a state of war.
Pick up anything from Wake Island?
- Pilot to navigator.
- Go ahead.
- What do you think, Monk?
- I don't know, Irish.
We ought to be there now.
Go another 10 minutes, then turn east.
Okay.
- There she is, Irish, dead ahead.
- Good guessing, Monk.
- Oh, shut up, will you?
- Magellan!
Pilot to crew. Wake Island, dead ahead.
- Hey, Wake Island in sight.
- Boy, what a navigator.
- There's nothing here but Marines.
- What'd you expect to see?
- Where'd you guys come from?
- Hickam Field.
- Any more coming?
- I don't know.
- Where are you going?
- Manila.
Gangway, men. Coming in.
Good work, captain.
Major Daniels, commanding.
Quincannon. Thank you, sir.
These are Lieutenants Williams,
McMartin and Rader.
And this is Lieutenant Hauser, our navigator.
We're gonna put him in a glass case in a museum.
- Did a good job, Hauser.
- The island looked pretty good to me, sir.
- Me too.
- Yes, I guess it did at that.
- Looks better than anytime since Monday.
- You mean Sunday, don't you?
Monday here was Sunday in Honolulu.
You've crossed the date line.
He's a pursuit pilot, major.
They don't get around very much.
Could we bunk down for five or six hours, sir?
We haven't had much sleep.
In six hours, you better be five and a half hours out.
With the beacons, Japs don't have to wait till daylight to call.
- My orders are to get you out in 20 minutes.
- Twenty minutes?
That's right.
- What do you say, sergeant?
- Well, we're halfway to Manila now, sir.
Don't see any reason we can't make it the rest of the way.
- Could use some help.
- Take all the men you need, sergeant.
All right.
You first five men come with me.
Get the cowling off number 3 engine.
Quincannon, our commander,
Major Bagley, wants to talk to you.
Yes, sir.
- So they really got the Arizona?
- Yes, sir.
Hickam Field was hit just as bad as Pearl Harbor.
A lot of fifth column work.
We got practically nothing off the ground, sir.
I've studied all the wars of history, gentlemen.
I've never come across any dirty treachery like that.
How many airplanes have you got, sir?
A week ago, we didn't have any.
A few days ago, they flew in 12 fighters from one of the carriers.
Eight were destroyed after they came in from patrol.
Only four left, sir?
Only two. And one of those can't fly.
But those four Grummans took on 60 Nips this afternoon.
Shot down plenty of them too.
Hogan and Ingersol got theirs.
I think you knew them.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I did.
I suppose the Japs will be back, major.
What are you gonna do then?
We got a lad catching a few winks of sleep that will take them all on single-handed.
- Lieutenant Rose.
- Bertie Rose?
- That's him.
- You guys remember Rose, don't you?
- Sure.
- Everybody kidded him about his size.
- Little bitty squirt about that high.
- Sure, we knew him.
I'd like to stand up and salute him.
Could we talk to him before we take off?
I'll tell him you wanted to see him.
He needs rest.
We have to roust him out any minute...
...and he hasn't had much of a chance to sleep lately.
- Ship's ready, sir.
- All right, sergeant.
And good luck to you.
It's been nice seeing you boys.
Go out and blast the Japs.
Teach them that treachery can't win no matter how much of a head start it has.
You young fellows will have to do that.
We're only fighting a delaying action here.
You can't hold out, sir?
I've got 400 Marines and they're fighting mad.
There's gonna be some Jap tail feathers flying around this island or I'm crazy.
Major Bagley, can't we fly you out, sir?
You and the rest of the wounded?
No, thanks, I'm fine here.
I'm not worth my weight in gasoline.
Me or anybody else.
They need that ship of yours in Manila.
Get it there.
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, by the way...
...if you see my old boss,
General MacArthur...
...tell him, no matter what the news is...
...we'll be in here pitching till they strike us out.
All right, sir, we will.
- I'll see you all somewhere.
- So long.
- Best of luck to you.
- Thanks.
- You think we ought to take him with us?
- He wouldn't leave this island...
...if you got him a lower berth in a Pullman.
- There you go.
- One for the wife, one for the kid.
He'll be old enough to read by the time I get back.
- Don't lose them, soldier.
- Don't worry.
I was gonna leave a letter here for the Clipper.
She got away yesterday.
Twenty-six bullet holes in her.
- Crew so mad they wanted to stay and fight.
- The old man got tough with them.
- Take care of this one.
- This one too.
Come on.
We don't want Tripoli to get hurt.
- Gave him the rank of top sergeant.
- No pedigree, but he sure can fight.
- He'd tackle a Jap three times his size.
- Anything.
No, I wish I could, but I'd get in an awful jam.
Give him to the Marines in Manila.
We gotta get him out of here.
- Come on, soldier.
- It's against regulations, pal.
- I can't take that dog onboard with me.
- You can.
- Wanna get me busted?
- You're not...
He's trained too. Look.
Tripoli, do you like Mr. Moto?
- See?
- Ain't that cute, Winocki?
- He's smart.
- What do you say, Brooklyn?
- Come on, soldier.
- Give him a kiss.
Gee, I'd like to, honest, but...
Gee, here goes my promotion.
- That's a good fellow.
- Duck. Here they come.
- Well, goodbye, sir. And luck.
- Same to you, boys.
- Anything we can do for you in Manila?
- You might send us more Japs.
- We'll try to.
- So long.
- Good luck, men.
- Good luck, sir.
Bye, sir.
What's the matter, Bill, can't you sleep?
No, I keep thinking of those marines back there on Wake.
- They haven't got a prayer, Irish.
- No, I know they haven't.
But they're gonna have some fun before anybody gets on that island.
Yeah.
How are things, sergeant?
Oh, I'm kind of...
What the...?
Why, it's a dog.
Who belongs to this?
Look at that. Is that your dog, chief?
It ain't my dog. What kind of a crew chief do you think I am?
- I was just asking.
- Who brought him onboard?
- Well, maybe he just walked on.
- And tied himself in a sack?
- Come on, who did it?
- I didn't.
You, Weinberg?
- Maybe the Marines done it.
- Sure.
- If I'm not mistaken, they had a dog.
- His name was Rover.
- No, his name was Tripoli.
- Talk fast.
- He had a cute trick.
- What?
Let's see if this is him. Look here, Tripoli.
What do you think of this Mr. Moto?
Moto. There you are. It's the same dog.
I know the dog came from Wake Island and I know you brought him onboard.
- Me?
- You can get busted for this.
Why don't you ask me, sergeant?
- I did it.
- You?
- Yeah, me. Shut up.
- Listen, Joe.
You ought to know better than do a trick like that.
- Why?
- Because it's against regulations.
Makes no difference. Regulations...
You know why this dog is here.
We know what chance those Marines have on that island, so they gave us this dog.
Go on up front and report me.
I've been busted out.
- Now, Joe, I did it. I don't...
- Shut up. I'm getting sore.
We got chased out before we can even light...
...got kicked all over the place by sneaking Nips...
...and you're yapping about regulations.
- You're changing your tune, ain't you?
- So, what if I am?
- I'd like to do a little chasing myself.
- Me too.
- Go on, tell them.
- I'm a half a mind to...
- I'd like to...
- Come here. Come here.
- Come here.
- Why'd you wanna do that for?
Pipe down.
Hey, look what's here.
What is this, sergeant? Noah's Ark?
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Who brought him on this airplane?
- He could have jumped on.
- Or flown in the window...
...but he didn't.
- No, sir.
- You know it's against regulations.
- Yes, sir.
And you don't know who did it?
You didn't see anybody do it?
No, sir, I didn't.
We can't very well throw him out now, can we?
- We could take care of him, sir.
- We can?
- Yes, sir.
- Who back there likes dogs, sergeant?
Why, I think Winocki and Weinberg like dogs.
- You think they'd like to take care of him?
- Yes, sir. I think they would.
- All right, sergeant, you tell them.
- Yes, sir. I'll tell them.
It'll be pretty tough on you if we gotta fly over that stuff ahead.
We can fix that.
He's a cute little pooch.
- What's his name?
- I think they call him "Tripoli."
- Tripoli?
- Yes. He don't like Japs.
Tripoli, what do you think of that guy Moto?
So you don't like Moto, huh?
Well, what is this, a flying doghouse?
Look out.
He doesn't like pursuit pilots.
- What's his name?
- Moto.
Hi, Moto.
- Didn't we tell you?
- That dog's a judge of character.
Here, Moto. Be nice, Moto.
Hello, Moto.
He doesn't like me.
I'm getting out of here.
Tripoli, you're gonna be very useful around here.
- Take good care of him, sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
Well, did you tell him how the pup got aboard?
- No.
- You didn't?
But I'm telling you to take care of him.
If he don't behave himself, you can take care of that too.
Pilot to crew.
We're going up to 20,000.
Better check your oxygen.
There you are, Tripoli.
He seems to like it all right.
He ain't putting up no kick.
Just like a baby on a bottle.
05564 to Clark Field.
- Here they are, sir.
- 05564 to Clark.
Clark Field to 05564.
What's your position? Go ahead.
We're about four miles northeast of the field.
Two thousand.
What are your landing instructions?
We've only got one runway.
North to south.
It's pretty rough.
The Japs just had a picnic.
Someday we're gonna find a field that's flat.
Hold him off a while.
Those tractors are still working out there.
Do not land. Keep your altitude.
Do not land.
Sorry, have to come straight in.
Running out of fuel.
Sergeant, get those tractors off that runway.
- Tell him to come in low over the fence.
- Come in low over the fence. South end.
Cut close to the wire, you haven't much room.
Tractors working down the middle of the runway.
We've got the fence with us.
- Take a look, Robby.
- Yes, sir.
- Hi there, Irish.
- Hi, major.
Say, when we were at Kelly Field, didn't I teach you how to get over a fence?
That's one way to stop quick.
I just cut her too fine.
Not bad, anyway.
After 7000 consecutive miles...
...you did a great job, all of you.
- Hi there, Rader.
- Hi you, sir.
- Don't tell me you've joined the bombers.
- No, I still belong to the opposition.
He doesn't appreciate a good airplane, major.
It ain't that.
It's just that I don't like them big.
- Tail wheel clear, sir. No damage.
- Okay.
Take her down the end and get her a full load of gas...
...drop your extra tanks and get ready for action, Irish.
- Okay, major.
- The Japs been hitting us...
...with 60 bombers at a clip.
You gotta be ready to take off at any time.
You can see yourself, you're wide open on the ground.
Colonel Blake wants to see you.
I'll pick you up in a while.
All right, sir.
Hold it.
You got any sectional maps for around here?
- Yeah, but I haven't got enough.
- Grab as many as you can get.
Find out what size bombs they'll give us and load them.
- Okay.
- I'll go with you.
- Thanks for the buggy ride, Irish.
- Okay, Tex.
- Weinberg, open the bomb bay.
- Right.
Peterson, check your radio.
You and Chester, give him a hand with the loading.
Winocki, find the line chief and see if they'll give you a transfer.
We'll get somebody to replace you.
All right, get going.
- Okay.
- Winocki.
You wanna get out of this crew?
- That's what you want me to do?
- Not necessarily.
You'd take that stuff
I've been handing you?
- We all make mistakes.
- I'm beginning to realize that myself. I...
Turn that dog over to the nearest Marine and get back and check those guns.
- Give them a good going over.
- Yes, sir.
Be ready as quick as you can, sergeant.
- Okay, Bill, let's go.
- Oh, captain.
Excuse me, sir.
Would you see if you could find out something about my boy?
Sure, I will, sergeant.
- Hey, buddy, any Marines around here?
- If so, the place would be in better shape.
- You a Marine?
- What's it to you?
- You're one all right. Got this for you.
- What's this?
You outfit on Wake gave it to us to deliver.
His name is Tripoli. Feed him good.
- He'll eat like a company commander.
- What's your name?
Callahan. Thanks.
- You all ready up there?
- All ready.
Let it go. Watch her, boys.
Steady. Keep her level.
Now turn her, fellows.
Turn her.
Hurry it up, boys. Make it snappy.
That's about it.
Take the strain off.
Take it away.
That's the situation as it stands right now.
- I've given the facts to you straight.
- Yes, sir.
We've taken a licking because we were caught on the ground.
Since then, they've outnumbered us 10-to-1.
Yet every time we've been up against them, they've lost five to our one.
In other words, if we were anywhere near equal, we could lick them.
The record proves it.
From now on, our job's to keep fighting with what we've got...
...till we get enough airplanes to blast them off the earth.
How long since you had any sleep, captain?
- We haven't had much time.
- When did you leave the mainland?
- Saturday night.
- Three days and three nights flying.
You've done a good job.
- I've got a good crew, sir.
- Yeah, I can believe it.
- Excuse me, sir.
- What'd you find, Moran?
That PT boat was right.
Looks like an invasion fleet.
- What's in it?
- There's a transport and a tanker.
- Got a battleship or cruiser and destroyers.
- Where?
Forty miles off Lingayen last time I saw them.
I didn't have much time to stick around.
Sky suddenly got full of Zeros.
So I headed for home.
I marked their position and course on this chart.
Right here. A flight of Boeing B-17s could give them a nice party, sir.
- We haven't got a flight of B-17s.
- You've got one, sir, loading up now.
- You wanna tackle it?
- Yes, sir.
All right, study this first.
Take your time, don't take any chances.
Moran will give you the dope and good luck.
Excuse me, sir. There's one thing more.
I told our crew chief I'd find out about his son, Lt. White.
Danny White. Can you tell me anything about him, sir?
Yeah, I can. He was killed the first day.
That's a shame.
Give these to old Robbie, will you?
I've known him for a long time.
How did it happen, sir?
Capt. Anderson in the other office can tell you more than I can.
He saw the whole thing happen.
Yes, sir.
Did you find out anything, sir?
How'd it happen?
He was trying to take his flight off during the first raid.
Before he could get off...
...they hit the runway right in front of him with a big one.
Didn't even get into the air.
It's not much to show for 20 years, is it, sir?
Get that airplane off the ground.
- All right, sergeant, let's go.
- Yes, sir.
Pull that dolly out.
- Close the bomb bay.
- How many loaded?
- Three, sir. All big ones.
- Thousand pounders?
- Yes, sir.
- Good.
Come on, let's get this thing out of here.
Take it away.
Doors are closed. Everything all set, sir.
Wheels up.
- Wheels up.
- Monk?
- Go ahead.
- What do you make it?
Three-thirty-one, Irish.
Okay, 331.
- You better put on your chute, Robbie.
- Yes, sir.
Navigator to pilot.
- Go ahead.
- We're about 30 miles off the coast.
You better go down
and take a look.
Okay. Going down.
Fighters.
Pilot to crew.
There's a flock of Zeros ahead.
Two o'clock at about 3000 feet above us.
There's another bunch at 10 o'clock.
Take your time.
Sing out if they get on our tail
and I'll kick her around.
Make it count.
We've got a lot to get even for.
Here they come.
Coming over.
Did you see that?
They break up in little pieces.
Winocki, one at 9 o'clock even.
Coming down.
Coming over.
Great.
Kick it left.
Take it to the right.
Hey, Joe. Fried Jap going down.
Gas line on two.
Gas line on two.
- Oil line's burning.
- Yeah.
It looks like we'll have to bail out.
Pilot to crew.
Are you hurt, Irish?
Yeah.
Pilot to crew. Abandon ship.
All right, come on, kids.
Tommy, get rid of your sight. You and Monk go out through the bomb bay.
- I know...
- I'll use the escape hatch.
- But you're hurt.
- Go on.
They'll have to drag the bottom of the ocean to get this.
- Open the escape hatch. I'll throw it out.
- Right.
- Irish, you...
- Go on, get out.
You're about 15 or 20 miles northwest of the field. Get out.
Yes, sir. Go ahead, Peterson.
- Weinberg.
- I don't think I'm gonna like this.
Go on.
All right, kid.
- Winocki.
- Go ahead, I'm coming.
Okay.
05564 to Clark Field.
Emergency landing. Emergency landing.
- There she is, sir. One engine's burning.
- Get your wheels down.
I can't do it. Gear's jammed.
It won't come down.
- Well, Joe?
- I just had a look at that B-17, sir.
What about her?
I counted over a hundred bullet holes in her.
Two motors hit, props are bent, controls in a mess, wheels damaged...
...fuel tanks are punctured, one wing's gone.
At least the tip.
- I don't see how they brought her down.
- Neither do I.
I suppose if we had 10 days and plenty of spare parts...
...we might make her fly again.
I don't know that we'll have 24 hours.
- We'll have to write off the Mary Ann.
- All right, we'll destroy her.
No use lighting any fires tonight.
They'd only hit us again.
Joe, send out a demolition squad in the morning.
- All right, sir.
- So long.
- What about the crew?
- They all got back all right, sir.
- Where are they now?
- Over at the hospital.
- Quincannon asked to see them.
- How's he?
That's too bad.
Yeah.
It's good to see you.
What are you...?
What are you doing with that rifle, Tex?
Picked up too many slugs in the P-39, Irish.
I'm a foot soldier now.
They finally got him where he belongs.
Anyway, we was using up
Japs so fast...
...they was afraid there wouldn't be none left to surrender.
- Winocki?
- Yes, sir.
- They told me you brought her in.
- He did, sir.
She came in herself. I just sat there.
It was a good job.
She's all right, huh?
She's all right, isn't she?
- Robbie.
- Yes, sir?
- She's all right, she'll fly again?
- Sure she will, skipper.
What's wrong with her?
- She's gonna be all right.
- Tell me.
- Props, gear, wing tip.
- Just a tip?
It's a wing tip, sir.
Couple of days...
- Two days?
- Two days. Yes, sir.
But she will fly again?
- Yeah.
- That's fine.
Get as many men as you need, Robbie.
The colonel will give them to you.
I'll get a clearance.
We'll leave right away.
- We gotta hurry.
- Nurse.
Easy, easy, Irish.
- Get the doctor right away.
- Oh, no. No, the doctor can't go.
Regulations.
Besides, we already got one passenger.
Is he here, that pursuit pilot?
- Here, sir.
- Okay, start them, Bill.
Sure, Irish.
Everybody in, chief?
All in, sir.
- Doors closed?
- Yes, sir.
Here we go.
- Lock them.
- Locked.
Wheels up.
- Coming up.
- They sound like they're gonna run all right.
- Robbie?
- Yes, sir.
- Pilot to navigator.
- Go ahead.
Monk.
- Monk, what's our course?
- Due east, skipper.
That's right into the sunrise.
- Right into the sunrise.
- Over here, major.
That's all, boys.
Well, let's get going, fellas.
We got a lot to do.
- Corporal?
- There's something wrong.
- Yeah? What?
- I don't know.
But there's something wrong.
- What are you talking about?
- We was to burn them airplanes.
- Well, did you?
- No, not all of them, sir.
- Why not?
- They're being stolen.
- What?
- Japs are stealing it.
Don't talk nonsense, man.
There have been Japanese through but they're snipers.
- They're not stealing.
- But...
Now, wait a minute, Mallory.
Let's get this straight.
- You had five B-17s to demolish.
- Yes, sir.
- What is it you wanna tell us?
- They're missing.
- You mean parts of them?
- Sure. I mean, yes, sir.
- Why on earth would anybody...?
- Now, look.
There's a B-17, the one that came in yesterday.
- The Mary Ann.
- Have you burned it?
- No, sir.
- Why not?
We was, but I told the boys
I ought to report them Japs.
Well, you've reported.
You better burn it.
Yes, sir.
What was he talking about?
I don't know, sir, but I'd better go out and have a look.
I'll go with you.
There's the stuff we've been missing.
- How's it coming, chief?
- All right.
- All right, Weinberg, lower away.
- Okay.
- Hey, sarge, your guns loaded?
- Sure they are. Keep a coming.
- Any bombs in?
- No, not yet. Come on.
- Get down, sarge.
- Get away from here.
- Get down. We're gonna burn this junk.
- What?
A couple of you get in there and get the live ammunition out.
Hey, wait a minute.
You said you gonna burn this plane?
The colonel said to burn it so she's gonna.
Get your stuff out.
Okay, boys. Bring in the gas.
Wait a minute.
Get this gasoline away from that airplane.
- Hey, Butch.
- Weinberg.
I thought you still was on a streetcar in Jersey.
- I wished I was.
- Lieutenant Williams.
- You ain't gonna burn that airplane?
- I got orders.
- I never enlisted to be no fireman.
- Go on.
If you know this firebug, get him out of here before he gets hurt.
I don't wanna, but orders is orders.
- What orders?
- To burn the plane.
- Who gave them to you?
- The CO.
Yeah? Well, you tell that CO to take a...
Take a look at this airplane.
- I am.
- Sorry, I didn't see you.
- Apparently not.
- There's no reason to burn this airplane.
- She's gonna be good as new.
- We're gonna rig a tail gun.
- Been working all night.
- She'll fly when we get through.
- We'll have her in the air in 24 hours.
- We won't have this field.
- I know, but...
- Now, look.
I appreciate what you're trying to do.
But our job's to destroy everything that'll be of use to those Japs.
Excuse me, but we can't move any gas.
- The trucks have all been wrecked.
- Scare up drums. Get it here.
- You can't get that ready in time to...
- We can.
- The bomb sight still in this airplane?
- Yes, sir. The one we "borrowed."
- We won't let...
- Give us a chance.
- I'd like to, but...
- Excuse me, sir.
I've been in this Army 20 years.
I've never asked a favor.
- We'll get her out. I give you my word.
- We'll burn her ourselves if we can't.
You're crazy. You know what'll happen if the Japs move in?
- We do, sir.
- All the rest?
- Yes, sir.
- You'll burn her?
Yes, sir.
All right. It's your funeral.
Forget it, corporal.
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
- Come on, boys. Let's...
- Excuse me, sir.
That observation plane is patched up and ready to go.
But I'm gonna need a gunner.
- Lieutenant.
- Yes?
I'll need one of your gunners.
Which one can you spare?
- Well...
- I can go.
- Wait a minute.
- He shouldn't go.
- He's more useful here.
- He's right, sir.
- All right. Go ahead.
- Yes, sir.
- That kid's awfully green, lieutenant.
- I know.
- Come on, give us a hand.
- Okay.
Don't like him leaving Mary Ann this way. Ain't good luck.
Be back in a couple of hours.
Swing it wide.
- Put some muscle into it.
- Will I!
Where'd you find that little beast, sergeant?
Beast?
He's a Marine Corps dog, lieutenant.
Yeah, I know. Hiya, Moto.
Hey, Moto, cut it out.
Cut it out.
Get him away, sergeant.
I've had enough trouble with Jap snipers without getting hydrophobia.
- His name ain't Moto, it's Tripoli.
- What?
Yeah, Tripoli. Maybe he don't like to be called Moto.
That's it. Cute trick, ain't it?
Yeah, very cute.
- How's it going, Rader?
- Not good. They're withdrawing to Bataan.
All I could get was a foxhole view with my face in six inches of dirt.
I thought if I came back
I could get an airplane.
You've got a fat chance for that.
We got one 0-47 left.
We might get you to Batavia or Port Darwin.
- They've got airplanes.
- We're getting out too.
- How about that B-17 I came in with?
- What? That crazy outfit?
They're working on it.
They've been up all night.
- Robbing the other wrecks for spare parts.
- Haven't got a chance getting it to fly.
- Forget it.
- But can I help them?
What kind of lunatics have we got in this Air Corps?
- Don't you know what's impossible?
- Thank you, sir.
- Hey.
- Excuse me, colonel.
- What?
- Can't I lend a hand too?
- You can go straight to...
- Help, sir? Thank you, sir.
Come on, stay with me. Come on.
- Hello, Weinberg.
- Gee, it's the pursuit pilot.
- We thought you was in the infantry.
- It's too hard on the feet.
- Hi, fellas.
- Hi, Tex.
- Things get too tough for you?
- I came to see if I could give you a hand.
How you making out with Moto there?
I'm getting along fine, Tommy, with Tripoli.
- I knew it all along, you morons.
- Sure, sure.
Looks like you guys got yourself a job.
- How about me and the Marine Corps?
- Listen to who's talking.
You asking to join this crew?
I'd rather fly than walk.
Even in this crate.
- Changed your mind, haven't you?
- No, but I'm willing to work my way.
Stop grinning and tell me what to do.
- Are you serious?
- Why, sure.
What we need is gas. I don't know how you're gonna get it, but get it.
Take the Marine with you so you can find your way back.
Okay, Callahan.
- Watch it now. Watch it.
- Pick up. Pick up the end.
All right. That's got her. Now, give me that.
Where's Weinberg?
- Left for oil. He'll be back.
- Okay.
Hey, those are Jap planes.
Get going, men.
Get on the guns.
Bring some more ammunition.
Good work, Robbie.
- Don't talk. Shoot.
- There's another one for you.
You dog!
Look, they're after the kid.
- They're gonna get him on the way down.
- Look out, kid.
Stay here, Weinberg.
Dirty...
I guess we'd better get him back now.
Yeah.
All right, now, boys, get on this lift.
Come on now.
Let's go. All together. Come on, heave.
- Well, there she is, sir.
- Think there's room in there to work a gun?
I'll show you.
Hand me the gun when I get in.
Okay.
It looks like it'll work all right.
The Japs are gonna get a surprise when they come on the tail of this B-17.
What about the tail wheel?
- I can get through if you leave it down.
- Okay.
Got a full bomb load?
To the gills. Don't know what we're gonna do with them.
Well, we can always drop them out.
- Hey, lieutenant?
- Yeah?
- Hand me a can of ammunition, will you?
- Coming up.
- Lieutenant, give us a hand here.
- Sure, let's go.
- Pull it in again. Here we go.
- How's that?
That's got her.
Now, get a couple of planks across here, will you?
- Sounds like they're getting closer.
- We'll have to be out by daylight.
- We will.
- It's almost 5 now.
Weinberg just finished Number 3.
Yeah, but if Rader doesn't get back with that gasoline soon we might as well...
- Who is it?
- Me, sir, Peterson and Callahan.
We got your gas, plenty.
- A whole truckload.
- Good.
- How we gonna get it out?
- Cans and buckets.
- Rader's bringing a bunch of soldiers.
- Here they are now.
- Where do you want it?
- Right where it is.
- Okay, men, let's get these drums out.
- Come on, snap into it.
Some of you get around behind.
Get around behind.
Good work, boys. Keep them going.
Step on it. Don't slop it.
Handle those cans careful.
Don't slop it around the plane.
Keep them level, keep them level.
Come on up here.
Okay, sarge. Number 4 will run.
- Fitter, get the cowling on.
- It's going on.
- Lieutenant, lieutenant.
- Yeah?
- Engines are ready.
- Good work. Thanks, kid.
- It's getting too close.
- Come on. Hurry it up.
- Don't spill it, don't spill it.
- Faster, men, with these buckets.
- Lieutenant Williams?
- Right here.
- They're coming. Through there.
- That'll have to be enough.
- Get everything clear to take her off.
- Yes. Hold that gas.
- Hold that gas.
- Drop those pails.
Give us a hand moving that shaft.
Come on. Get this stuff out of here.
Some get around to the front wheels.
Start her up as soon as we're turned around.
- Winocki, get on the guns.
- Come on, Peterson.
Try and hold them off.
Get in, in the bomb sight.
Monk. You and Callahan, siphon this gasoline.
If it won't start, we'll burn her.
Come on, get on this tail.
Come on now, shove her.
Straight back. Shove her.
- Hey!
- Hold it there!
That's all right.
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Keep going.
Okay.
Weinberg, get inside to help Rader.
Okay, that's far enough. Turn her around.
That's enough. Hold it.
Now, take her around. Come on.
Hard, now. Push. Everybody.
Come on. Take her around.
That's enough. That's enough.
That's far enough.
All right, soldiers.
Get going, soldiers. Run.
Keep clear of the props.
All clear. Start it, lieutenant.
Okay, stay clear.
- Get everybody out.
- Lieutenant.
But we've got to. Go on.
All right, bring over that gasoline.
Come on.
Come on.
Don't burn it.
Hold it, hold it, hold it!
Get out of there. Get out.
Keep clear. Get away.
Go ahead, Tex.
Give it to her.
- Wheels up.
- Coming up.
That's all right, sir.
It's this one here, Robbie.
That's easy.
How are we doing, sir?
For a plane they said would never fly again, we're fine.
- How's our fuel consumption?
- Nothing to worry about.
We'll make Australia all right.
- Peterson picked up news on the radio.
- What's that?
There's a Jap invasion fleet headed for Australia.
That's what they think.
Our Pacific fleet's hunting for them.
I wish them luck.
You know, Tex...
...you're a funny-looking thing to be flying a B-17.
Yeah? I hope they got P-40s in Darwin.
If they haven't, I'm gonna take up knitting.
I think he's the guy that shot me in the arm just so he could get in that seat.
Don't do me an injustice, Bill.
I'd only shoot you to get out this seat.
Why don't you fellas sleep while you can?
We kind of got out of the habit.
How about it, Joe?
Is that tail gun of yours gonna work?
Just wait and see.
Hey, sergeant, we gonna stop at Mindanao?
- No, we've already passed there.
- Yeah?
You look like you know how to work that gun, Callahan.
What do you think a Marine uses, a bow and arrow?
I wouldn't put it past them.
Navigator to pilot.
Take a look down below.
On the left, right under us.
- Holy smoke.
- Boy, look at that.
Looks like we hit the jackpot.
- Here we go again.
- Start shooting.
- Those are Japs.
- What'll we do?
- Pull up through the clouds.
- Going up.
Where we going?
Give me a crack at them.
Hold your horses. Get below.
We're gonna start a war, not a fight.
Four degrees north, 124 degrees east.
Okay. Pilot to radio.
Did you hear that, Peterson?
Write it down.
Four north, 124 east. Got it?
Four north, 124 east.
Contact all air bases in this area.
Army, Navy, carriers, everyone you can reach.
Tell them we sighted a big Jap task force headed south.
- Give them that position.
- Yes, sir.
We're gonna play hide-and-seek
until they get here.
- Radio to pilot.
- Go ahead, Peterson.
Army bombers and Navy torpedo planes have reached the approximate position.
Their formation leader's calling you
on the command set.
Okay.
Williams in 05564 talking. Go ahead.
Hello, Bill. This is Jack Harper.
We're looking for you. Where are you?
Hiya, Jack. We're at 14,000.
There they are.
Where are those Japs you're worrying about, Bill?
We're roosting right over them.
Just make a turn and follow us.
Turning now.
Pilot to crew. Get ready, fellas.
This ought to be fun.
- Let's go calling, Tex.
- Yeah, man.
Now you're gonna see what an Air Force can do.
- How do you want it?
- The cruiser third from the right.
Take her in line,
I'll pour them down their funnels.
- Don't waste any eggs, Popeye.
- You watch the basket, I'll lay the eggs.
Bomb bay doors opening.
Hold it.
- Ready to bomb.
- Hold it.
Slide right.
Left a little.
To the left.
Steady.
Bombs away.
Here they come. Weinberg to pilot.
About nine Japs a little above us, around 4 o'clock.
Wait for them and make them count.
Monk, coming down, straight ahead.
- Did you get hit?
- Sure, I got hit.
- Do you need some...?
- Watch out.
- Did you see that?
- What do you want, a cigar?
They're coming in on our tail.
Wait for them. They don't know we got a stinger in our tail.
- Which one now, Tommy?
- Let's take that carrier straight ahead.
Okay.
- What do you think of our bomber now?
- Boy, I'll take it for mine.
We gotta get out of here.
We just lost half our gas.
Attention.
All right, men. At ease.
Turn that thing off, Henson.
Well, gentlemen...
...this is it.
This is what we've been waiting for.
Tonight, your target is Tokyo.
You're gonna play them the "Star
Spangled Banner" with two-ton bombs.
You've got to remember what you've learned...
...and follow your squadron leaders.
They'll get you in and they'll get you out too.
Williams, you lead the first section.
Rader, the second.
Hauser will navigate for the entire squadron...
...and McMartin will talk to you bombardiers before taking off.
Any questions?
All right, that's all.
Good luck to you and give them hell.
We shall carry the attack
against the enemy.
We shall hit him and hit him again...
... wherever and whenever
we can reach him.
For we intend to bring
this battle to him...
... on his own home grounds.
THE GREAT KING
THE WORK ON THIS MOVIE BEGAN
IN THE EARLY SUMMER
OF THE YEAR 1940.
THE ESSENTIAL SCENES
STRICTLY ABIDE
BY THE HISTORICAL FACTS
AND COVER
ABOVE ALL THE TRIALS
OF THE SEVEN YEARS' WAR,
WHERE THE OUTSTANDING
PERSONALITY OF THE KING
HAD TO WITHSTAND AND A TEST.
PRECISELY HERE HE GREW
TO A GREATNESS
UNMATCHED IN HUMAN HISTORY.
THE MOST IMPORTANT
STATEMENTS OF THE KING
ORIGINATE FROM
HIS OWN MOUTH.
Germany is in a terrible crisis.
We live in a time that will determine everything and will change the face of Europe.
Before its determination, you will have to survive dreadful things.
But upon its development, the sky will clear up and become bright.
And no matter how great the number of my enemies is,
I believe in my good cause and the admirable braveness of our troops, from the marshal to the youngest soldier!
The Army attacks!
The Prussians are attacking!
Tell the Cossacks to get ready to attack!
Yes, sir!
The Austrian artillery will join in when the cemetery is attacked!
We are ready to go!
Long live Maria Theresa!
The Austrians are coming!
Child, Luise, hurry UP!
For God's sake!
- Franz! Where is Franz?
- Franz!
Don't cry! Don't cry!
It's all right!
Franz!
- What's the matter?
- It's just a scratch!
Take the child away!
Look, Father! Our beautiful mill!
I'll follow later.
Wait for me in Lebus.
Watch out! It's burning!
The Regiment of Bernburg is stuck!
The Hussars can't move on!
So we bypass the field of Bernburg, attack from the right wing, and connect at the left wing with Seydlitz!
Regiment of Bernburg, ready to attack!
- What is it?
- This is suicide!
I'm telling you, it's suicide!
- Stand still, you spineless coward!
- I'm not insane!
Signal to collect troops!
- Where is His Majesty?
- Not here.
Report to General Schenkendorf.
What is it?
Report from Colonel Bernburg.
The regiment has been fought off.
Fought off, Lieutenant?
It fell apart, General.
I hope you're not saying the regiment took flight.
The left wing beaten, the right wing annihilated, the center--
Took flight.
Just say it as it is, Finken.
Took flight.
A new word for us.
We have to swallow it.
The Bernburg taking flight.
Well, more bad news?
Let's hear!
Seydlitz has been beaten, my General!
The whole left wing annihilated!
Follow me, gentlemen.
Let's go look for death, since it can't seem to find us.
- Stop! What are you doing?
- But I have to bandage you.
Tearing the flag apart?
Dress my wound with the flag?
For God's sake,
I don't have anything else.
What do you need the old, torn-up flag for?
Old, torn-up flag?
How do you like that?
What a thing to say!
The flag almost cost you your life, and the dame...
- What's your name, anyway?
- Luise.
Luise wants to tear it up.
She is indeed a whimsical girl.
Here, use this bandage.
That poor guy doesn't need it anymore.
You think it's better to take away the bandage of a dead man than to use a tom-up flag?
Don't talk nonsense!
Go on!
Not everything is lost as long as we have our flag.
But you don't understand that.
How could you?
You are just a little girl.
But very pretty!
Go ahead, now.
Don't stop. Carry on.
Does it hurt?
- Whose carriage is it out there?
- It's mine.
We'll take it to the next casualty station.
MUSK we?
Well, they're dying like flies in our hands.
But I have to go to Lebus, but then...
Well, take it already, but bring it back soon.
All right.
You've seen the last of that carriage.
Please don't say that.
Don't say that.
Do you really think they'll bring it back? You are naive.
But my parents, and my brother!
This is terrible! Terrible!
You're right about that.
Everything is terrible.
Take the fastest route to Vienna.
Report to Her Imperial Majesty.
With all humility before God, who gave His blessing to the troops and brave allies of Her most gracious
Imperial Majesty,
General Laudon reports that Her Majesty's archenemy, the King of Prussia, has been smashed at today's battle at Kunersdorf.
In fact, in such a way that no wonder should be capable of ever making him rise again.
And that the House of Habsburg will also triumph in the same way, through the grace of heaven, over every one of its enemies in the future, and invokes Your loyal General above Your Imperial Majesty's head and above the heads of Your Imperial Majesty's children.
I am cold, Schenkendorf.
But that's your coat, Schenkendorf.
Now you're going to be cold.
I'm not cold, Your Majesty.
You have hot blood, Schenkendorf.
Mine is frozen.
- Have you seen that, Schenkendorf?
- What, Your Majesty?
The Prussians were fleeing.
The Regiment of Bernburg,
Your Majesty.
But they are Prussians.
The Regiment of Bernburg.
Aren't they, Schenkendorf?
I have seen wounds in the backs of soldiers! Back wounds!
They didn't exist in Prussia... until today!
Your Majesty should get some rest.
I'm shivering, Schenkendorf!
The King of Prussia shivers!
Have you ever seen me do that?
It's very cold, Your Majesty.
Kunersdorf.
When I heard that name for the first time...
I've been here as a young man.
Kunersdorf.
That this would be the name of my end?
Kunersdorf.
And where to now, Your Majesty?
To hell, Schenkendorf.
It's warm there. I have to defrost.
I'm unable to move any limb.
Dessau! Clear the house over there at once for His Majesty.
Yes, sir.
The evening air is poison,
Your Majesty.
- Poison?
- Your Majesty.
Kunersdorf.
A page in history.
A small page, two lines, perhaps.
Under which Prussia lies buried.
Dust, Schenkendorf.
Does Your Majesty want to stay here?
Do you think I am glued on here?
To turn into stone?
To turn into the monument of my shame?
I have to write.
It's the only thing I have left.
Where is the house?
The house that's still standing?
Over there, next to the mill,
Your Majesty.
No entry!
I want to get out of here!
I just want to get my belongings!
- I need my belongings!
- You stupid damsel!
I must be allowed to take my belongings, since you are already throwing me out of my own house!
Let the woman be.
Rather, bring me a board, some cloth, or anything else you can find so I can close the window.
Everything is riddled and shot apart!
Get a measure of wood to light the candle again.
I'm sure you have plenty of light,
Major!
Our whole mill lightens your room!
What are you doing there?
I take what I care about.
And what you have not burned yet or shot apart.
And that picture there...
It shall burn.
He who burned our mill.
That's what he turned our country into!
What a great sovereign!
Get a measure of wood.
From where?
There is no fire in our oven anymore.
Do you hate him a lot?
There aren't many left who could hate him.
The whole country is littered with corpses.
Every village, every house, every barn: dead bodies everywhere.
Animals and children!
Yes, that's terrible.
But there's worse.
The war is the worst.
Who wanted it? I didn't!
Nor did my father!
You, perhaps?
No.
We're just poor millers!
Why do we have to suffer and pay for the King's war?
Leave, my child.
He doesn't have to worry about where he'll find a carriage now to haul off his last belongings!
Or whether he'll find a roof over his head!
He can sit at home in his beautiful castle!
Get up.
You're sitting on my coat.
Now the mill is burning out.
Go, at last.
Are you injured?
No.
Can I help you?
Yes. Leave me alone.
What are you doing here, woman?
Get out!
Don't make a fuss.
- They hate me.
- Why?
- Your Majesty--
- Don't answer.
This letter will go via express messenger to Count Finkenstein in Berlin.
“Kunersdorf, August 12, 1759.
This morning at 11:00,
I attacked the enemy.
We drove them as far as the Jewish cemetery near Frankfurt.
All my troops have worked wonders, but this churchyard brought us enormous casualties.
Our men were in disarray.
Two horses died under me.
My misfortune is that I'm still alive.
Our casualties are very serious.
Of an army of 48,000 men
I have now, as I write this, less than 3,000 left. "
But that's impossible.
Yes, Your Majesty, it is...
“Everyone's fleeing, and I have no command over my men anymore.
Everyone in Berlin would be well advised to have his safety in mind.
This is a horrible disaster.
I will not survive it.
I have no more resources, and, without lying, it appears to me that all is lost.
I will not survive the downfall of my fatherland.
Goodbye, forever,
Frederick. “
Aunt Elisabeth.
It is the King's wish that Her Majesty leave for Magdeburg at once and take the treasury along.
Get a hold of yourself, my boy.
I will travel as soon as possible.
Notify the headquarters at once.
I will try immediately to get through to the King.
Send me to the headquarters to see the King.
No, Royal Highness.
Children shouldn't be in war.
Your majesty-
We have to see him, Aunt Elisabeth.
We have to get his assurance.
- We have to be with him.
- Child, what are you talking about?
You're not able to ride with your injury yet, Major!
I'll take a carriage, Excellency.
You can depend on it.
I will get through.
And if something happens to you?
Or if you're arrested?
We still don't even know where the Russians are!
The papers may, under no circumstances, fall into the wrong hands!
They won't fall into the wrong hands.
And if I should be forced to,
I will eat them, Excellency!
The King often thought there would be no way out, but he always found one in the end.
But the King needs you.
He doesn't need me.
Neither in bad nor in good days.
Not even in death?
Never. Never.
Good luck with your trip.
Just take my carriage.
It's down at Schoenhauser Avenue--
Are you eavesdropping?
A Prussian Prince is not eavesdropping. He's listening.
Major Rochow, you're going to see the King.
You have to take me with you.
I cannot do that.
I don't have an authorization for it.
Who has to issue it?
The Queen. But I'm glad
I don't have it, Prince.
I'm in a hurry.
Peace. That's the only choice we have left.
The King has not passed the Supreme Command on to me to initiate peace negotiations, but to protect his capital.
I bet the Russians are already in Berlin.
Let's face the facts.
The King surrenders.
And if he won't do it, we'll have to force him.
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!
Let's not forget we are Prussian generals!
That's a revolt!
It's no fun anymore to be an officer.
The impression that it's no fun for you anymore, Colonel Bernburg,
I've already had for three days.
What are you saying, General?
In my opinion, Colonel, your regiment was a crying shame at Kunersdorf.
Half of my men are dead.
What about the rest, Colonel?
Was I supposed to senselessly sacrifice the rest of them, too?
Is this a slaughterhouse, or are we waging a war?
"Senselessly“?
The conduct of Regiment of Bernburg was crucial to the outcome of the battle.
Just let it be, Seydlitz.
It's all over and lost anyway.
Berlin was reeling in victory.
The news of the lost battle caused a storm of outrage and disappointment.
Why? Please answer me.
Why, for God's sake, did you send out a messenger of victory to Berlin too soon?
Were you not notified, my dear brother, that the battle was already won?
The victory was taken from me by a circumstance I couldn't assess.
What circumstance?
The Prussians took flight.
They failed at the impossible.
What does that mean?
Not more than I said.
They failed at the impossible.
What was impossible?
An order? A plan of action?
What was impossible?
I plead for your criticism, General!
- I'm not entitled to that.
- I command it.
Then I do not begin at the sad ending.
You asked the impossible of the whole nation!
All of Europe is against Prussia!
That's what you have accomplished!
Not only did you stand against the Austrians and the Russians at Kunersdorf, but your army was spread out and scattered everywhere, waiting for the countless enemies!
If you would have pursued the politics of decreasing the number of your enemies, instead of increasing it every year, we would have had an honorable peace long ago, and Prussia would be blooming!
I didn't ask for your political criticism. You're not versed in that.
I ask you as a General, as the Generalissimo of the Prussian Army that you are today, what was wrong about the plan for the battle of Kunersdorf?
What was the impossible
I've asked for?
You underestimated the number of the Russians!
Correct.
You underestimated the aggressiveness of the Austrians!
Correct.
You attacked at least two days too early.
If you would have waited until the Prussians had barricaded their positions, so they would have been able to cope with the stampede, we would still have them today.
It wasn't about holding positions, but taking positions!
Why did you rush Seydlitz into battle against his will?
Why did you let the Regiment of Bernburg approach the fire-breathing walls of the cemetery, where they broke down?
This position was not to be taken.
Never, and under no circumstances.
Not even by the Prussians!
If you would have--!
Would have, would have, would have!
If they would have listened!
Just listened!
Listened to the orders of their King!
They would have stalled at that position!
They would have let themselves be gunned down!
They would have built a wall of corpses, of Prussian corpses!
And kept the Austrians there until Tauentzien, with his cannons, would have made it through the mud!
Until they would have brought the cannons to Mühlberg!
I would have needed two hours!
Only two hours, perhaps just one.
But I couldn't count on my Prussians taking flight, my dear brother!
That's why we were bleeding to death in Kunersdorf!
And Prussia has to pay for that today!
That a few soldiers held their lives in higher regard than the life of Prussia!
Prussia lived under our father.
He was a great soldier, possibly even greater than you.
He was the one who established the army.
But he kept the peace, and he kept measure.
He built villages and cities.
He built roads.
He turned swampland into prosperous farmland.
A life's work for peace.
And to conserve this peace,
I have to wage war.
A war that will be the end of a free Germany.
What Germany are you referring to?
This antiquated, only of bygone splendor, living Roman Empire of a German nation?
This utopia should go under.
And there has to appear a German Empire led by Prussia!
Only Prussia has the material and moral requirements for this calling!
Not Habsburg!
Habsburg has proven itself incapable of such leadership, since it is willing to share its power over Germany with foreign nations who don't even care about the well-being of the Germans.
It is sad that this war is leading nations of one bloodline against each other!
This fact pains me more than anything.
But the historical imperatives are stronger than our wishes.
So I have asked you to come here,
Generalissimo, to get to know your instructions for the Supreme Commander of the Silesian Army,
General von Finken.
It is no longer necessary.
The Generals will receive their instructions from me again.
- Then I am released from duty?
- Yes.
It is unfortunate that we get along with each other so poorly, Heinrich.
When did you ever have fraternal emotions, Your Majesty?
If I would have died at Kunersdorf, and I came close twice, then you would be, according to my will, the King of Prussia today.
It wasn't according to destiny that this will was to be found on me.
You've already pushed a brother aside that way once, without saying you mistreated him.
So he died from grief about it.
Well, you'll have to excuse me.
I am on duty.
Generals.
Are the gentlemen debating?
What are your reports?
Your Majesty, we heard about your illness--
I know, you're concerned about my well-being.
May I ask you,
Supreme Commander?
The Prussian Army is 28,000 men strong again.
That's barely more than half.
Two days before the battle, we were 48,000 strong.
What did you decide?
To beg you to make peace,
Your Majesty.
With who? The Russians?
As well as with the Austrians, the
French, the Saxons, and the Swedes.
- You don't know any other way out?
- No other, Your Majesty.
None of my generals holds a different view?
- Seydlitz?
- No, Your Majesty.
- Schenkendorf?
- His Majesty has to make peace.
Otherwise, our soldiers will force us to make peace.
Tauentzien?
Trying to snatch away victory from such superiority equals tempting God.
And it will be our downfall to defy destiny.
So you want to surrender?
Zieten, do you agree, too?
I take the Supreme Command back from the hands of General von Finken.
We've gained time.
The Russians remained in their positions.
General Saltykov doesn't take advantage of his victory.
We will thwart the enemy, save Berlin, or let ourselves be slaughtered.
Whoever is afraid to follow me may go home.
I won't stand in his way.
One more thing.
Colonel Bernburg, line up your regiment at the exit of the village of Lebus.
Luise, just wait until we've arrived in Lebus.
Your father--
- I am cold.
- Do you want your coat?
Niehoff, hand over her coat.
So, here you go.
We're still not in Lebus.
They will never wait that long.
Then you have to stay with us, Luise!
Since we got you in trouble to begin with.
What am I supposed to do amongst soldiers?
It's not that bad amongst soldiers, Luise.
Where else are you going to go?
Home, perhaps?
To Kunersdorf? Well, see.
This cursed King! He's got a lot to answer for, that devil!
He's a devil, all right.
But cursed he is not.
You only have to see him once.
You would talk differently.
I have no desire at all for your King.
Now, calm down, Luise.
After all, he is your King, too.
I see something! I see something!
Here, hold the reins, because I really see something!
See? You're already laughing again!
But the goose doesn't belong to you, Sergeant.
It belongs to me now.
It's loot, just like our horse.
- A fine dinner we have here.
- Are you feeling better?
Yes, I'm all right.
Just a little exhausted, still.
- Well, lay back down, then.
- Yes.
And where is my nursemaid,
Niehoff?
Since when am I his nursemaid,
Sergeant?
My name is Paul Treskow, but you may call me Paul.
And this is my friend,
Friedrich Ernst Niehoff.
You may call him Niehoff.
And take your hands off him.
We won't even start that.
Listen up! Order of the King!
All the injured and scattered men of the Regiment of Bernburg have to concentrate at the exit of the village Lebus at 6:00 in the evening!
Understood!
There! Go now!
But we don't have to hurry, Paul.
They won't start without us.
We have the flag.
The flag will be retracted, the officers lose their stripes, and the soldiers their bands and brocades!
And the drummers won't tabor the march anymore!
Only one woodblock and one drum will set the pace, and proclaim at the front of the regiment:
“Here come those who would rather live than be victorious!"
MOVE!
Long live the King!
He died with the words,
"Long live the King!“
I can't be bothered with that.
He was fleeing battle.
And he was fleeing life.
He had no ethical conscience.
Go.
Von Renew, you came at the fight “ma.
You'll take over the Regiment of Bernburg, Colonel von Retzow.
Your Majesty,
I will build up the regiment--
It's all right.
I know it is difficult to lead a dishonored regiment.
Bear it like I have to bear it.
- You can go.
- Your Majesty.
You may keep your stripes.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Well, you're some cadet.
Running away and coming to field without order!
I apologize, Uncle.
- Uncle? I am your King, Lieutenant!
- Your Majesty!
Well, first eat something, my boy.
I don't need anything to eat right now, Your Majesty.
But you were traveling all day.
Go on. Sit down.
What's new in Berlin?
Are the people very angry with me?
Not in my presence, Your Majesty.
- I see, but otherwise you think, yes.
- I don't know.
I know it. I know the Berliner.
They have a loose tongue.
But, otherwise, they are quite useful.
You have to go back, Heinrich.
I beg you, Your Majesty.
Please let me stay.
I don't want to endanger you.
- Can you smell something?
- Chocolate.
Yes, chocolate.
A rare product these days, isn't it?
- Did you really?
- Do you want to try it?
- Rather not.
- You don't know it. Special blend.
Only for His Majesty.
Only for his personal use.
- Alfons!
- Try it already.
- That's not possible.
- Try it!
- That's not possible, Alfons.
- I see, you're making difficulties!
- I'm no murderer.
- Murderer?
Don't you love your fatherland?
Besides, you've been paid very well, you two-faced pig.
First you take money, and then you back out?
- Alfons!
- You!
You won't trick us again.
I'll stay here tonight and watch you.
When I leave for Vienna tomorrow morning,
I'd like to take good news along.
Understood, my friend?
You are the hope of the state,
Heinrich.
Do you know that?
You make me unhappy, Your Majesty--
It's not about our happiness,
Heinrich.
I'd also be happy to keep you here.
But I don't have the right to such happiness.
We're not allowed to do what we want.
Do you think I want to wage war?
I have to. I have to.
Come here.
Put all your diligence into your studies.
You know, I don't think a great deal of your brother, the Crown Prince.
Time marches on. We can arrange that you'll be in my place one day.
Prepare for it.
So, my boy, now I'm on duty.
- May I wait for Your Majesty?
- Yes, yes. You can wait here.
We have to walk around like convicts!
I don't care at all.
Whether I have that Prussian cheese on here or not, it's the same thing to me after all.
Hopefully he'll also take away the red lapels and gold buttons soon, and we'll be civilians again!
Civilians! Civilians!
What more can you ask for?
You're about to run off again, aren't you?
Have you already forgotten your last gauntlet?
Look at that. How do you smuggle all that over the border?
As a messenger, young lady.
Borders don't exist for a messenger.
And where did you get the money?
Well, let's hear!
Where did you get it?
Well, that, on the other hand, is a state secret.
- Here you are!
- Well, hello!
What kind of surprises do you have for us?
- Leave me alone.
- You can't do that.
May I introduce myself?
Alfons. The "beautiful" Alfons!
Would you like to drink with me?
To the King?
Paul.
You don't have to ask Paul for permission.
- You may drink to the King with me.
- No, I don't drink.
- What are you doing here?
- You.
If the King is dead tomorrow, it'll be your fault.
- If you don't shut your dirty mouth--
- But what did I say?
What happened?
Who tore up your uniform like that?
This guy. "The old Fritz. "
Stupid jokes on top of everything!
What's the matter?
Let's go, Luise.
- The King tore up your uniforms?
- Yes, the King. The King did it.
Hide the jiggers!
The King is inspecting the camp!
The King!
- Where is the King?
- Just go down there, little lady.
- But, Royal Highness!
- Light the candle.
- And where is Your Majesty sleeping?
- Well, bring me my coat.
You may go-
Who is sleeping in there?
The replacement of the guard,
Your Majesty.
Then I'll eat here.
Just put my dinner down here.
In the hall, Your Majesty?
We take off tomorrow morning at 3:00, towards Torgau.
The carriage will take the Prince back to Berlin as soon as he awakes.
And what if he refuses?
Then tell him it's the King's order.
- Good night, Dessau.
- Good night, Your Majesty.
- What's that?
- Chocolate, Your Majesty.
Where did you get that?
Via certain byways, Your Majesty. byways.
Contraband from Wanna.
Contraband!
You know, I don't make special demands.
Wake me quietly tomorrow morning so the Prince doesn't wake up.
You may have the rest of the food.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Franz! What's the matter?
Franz!
Poison?
From the House of Habsburg!
Guard!
VIENNA
It couldn't have happened in a different way.
The story would have lost its meaning if Frederick wouldn't have been beaten at Kunersdorf.
- Why?
- Why?
Your question is a little straightforward, General Laudon.
I also expect a straightforward answer, dear Count.
Only Habsburg has the legitimate leadership of Germany.
This little Marquis of Brandenburg is acting up like a king.
Let me remind you of the case of your Royal Crown.
Which your dear grandfather took beyond the Empire's border to Königsberg, where he put it, in an act of megalomania, and on his own authority, over his elector's coronet.
Perhaps you're right, and the legitimacy of his royalty has not been proven--
The opposite has been proven,
General Laudon.
Good, good, but he has proven that he is born to be king, and not only on the battlefield,
Count Kaunitz.
As you know, General Laudon has the tendency to let a discussion of the opponent stray so far from the truth that his own achievements are eclipsed by it.
But concerning a thief, this chivalry appears to be a little out of place, and, furthermore, very dangerous.
The tendency to underestimate the opponent also has its perils, dear Count.
And it appears to me, even the greater ones.
When the Empire was in peril to life, it wasn't saved by one of the crowned heads of legitimate kings, but... by this guy here.
Prince Eugene of Savoy.
And in reverence of this memento, let us talk with respect about a great man.
- About a great king.
- General Laudon? A dispatch.
But, Excellency, isn't that taking it too far?
To compare the victor of Yugoslavia and Belgrade, this most loyal servant of his Emperor, this genius of a commander, with the defeated King of Prussia?
May I interrupt your historical excursion?
The Prussians are marching towards Torgau.
With a new army.
46,000 men.
The minuet has begun.
Her Majesty welcomes you.
We are singing, and he is marching.
Should I get a doctor for you,
Your Majesty?
Leave me alone with your doctors.
They only tell me it's gout.
I can feel that myself.
This awful music!
And he's out of tune, as well.
Should I tell him to stop,
Your Majesty?
No.
The leper clanger shall clang on.
It shall not leave the ears of the Bernburger.
His Majesty regrets that he will not be able to see the generals.
His Majesty feels below par.
His Majesty wishes to hear the generals' concerns from the mouth of his Royal Highness,
Prince Heinrich.
The King wishes not to see the Civil Deputation of the cities Berlin and Magdeburg.
He suggests to contact the president of the Royal Government's Cabinet in Berlin, the Count von Finkenstein.
His Majesty believes you could have saved yourself this exhausting detour.
Good morning, gentlemen.
My regards to Berlin.
The citizens of the cities of Prussia are weary of this war.
I see. The citizens of the cities of Prussia are weary of this war.
So are we, Mayor!
Eventually, the whole war plays out on the back of the citizens.
Who has to pay for it?
The people are moaning much more than His Majesty seems to know.
Calm down, gentlemen.
His Majesty is well aware of that.
People mutter and rant everywhere, and believe me, they don't even exclude the King himself.
Well, that's not that bad.
That's the nature of the matter.
Nobody believes in victory anymore.
That's terrible.
They may rant. The soldiers rant, too.
And it's understandable that you all are weary of the war.
So are we, Mayor, believe me.
But to doubt victory is high treason.
You're lucky you're only allowed to bring forward your opinions to me, here in the antechamber.
Because with His Majesty?
Well, so...
Please leave me alone now.
I have work to do.
My dear, you're not versed in that.
I'm old enough to know what I'm talking about.
And I am your brother.
I speak for the whole Royal House.
Only a miracle could save you now.
But no one in the family believes in such a miracle.
We agree on that, my dear.
I don't believe in miracles, either.
- There is one way out.
- I'm curious.
An alliance with France.
A plea for peace.
Form an alliance with the French.
Hand me the bottle.
Think about yourself, too.
You are ill.
Yes, I have gout.
But not in the head, thank God.
An alliance with France!
You guys are dilettantes.
The French are the most natural allies of Prussia!
- An alliance means Prussia's safety!
- Nonsense!
The intention of the Pact of
Versailles is to fragment Prussia!
I know this Pompadour state!
They would like the map to look like it did after the Thirty Years' War!
Nothing but small duchies, and each one as weak as possible!
But you can count on it, I won't give away one district! Not one village!
And if it should take 10 years!
Or 20!
The French will give us an honorable peace, and they will--
They will, they will! Kid's stuff!
I know where you get these ideas.
The Margraves of Bayreuth has started peace negotiations with Versailles behind my back.
It's a conspiracy.
I'm well aware of that.
But I'm telling you, the French will always be enemies of Prussia!
As long as Prussia still has to expand its territory.
My successors may become the allies of France one day if they have rounded off their state enough!
You will destroy the Monarchy.
I am the King.
That's my concern.
Just like you defamed the Regiment of Bernburg.
The regiment of the old Dessau, who was a friend of our father.
You will put Prussia to shame in the same way.
It disagrees with the tradition of our Royal House.
Tradition!
What does tradition mean to you?
A foreign word for arrogance, laziness, and gutlessness.
You must be blind.
You don't even see what's happening in the country.
You don't know anything about the voice of citizens or the nobility.
You're conspiring against me.
All of you. My own family.
And I know so are many of my generals.
But I have no room for traitors in my state.
Not even highborn traitors.
You should be decapitated.
You, Heini! You, Heini!
- What's the matter?
- I can't go on!
None of us can.
But we don't make a fuss like you.
We have to walk on and walk on.
Nothing but walk on.
Day and night.
Down to our bare bones.
We don't walk. We march.
The King wins his war with my legs.
Not with mine anymore.
Soon, I will only march in one direction.
The opposite way.
You're really something.
Zieten, you won't attack until I give the command.
Not before, Zieten.
You'll hear about the exact time of your attack from my adjutant.
Zieten will initiate our attack.
And if Daun is forced to defend himself with all his forces in the South,
I will attack from behind, from the North.
I hand over the command of the Bernburg privates to Zieten, so he can secure the flank.
We have to avoid at all cost an attack by the enemy.
My plan is based on that.
An attack from all sides precisely at the same time.
And don't fire unnecessarily, especially not too early.
Approach the enemy up to 10 or 20 feet, fire a volley straight up his nose, and then finish him off with your bayonet into his ribs!
Drum that into your privates.
Where the enemy retreats, the cavalry must compactly attack, drive in their horses full throttle, and pack a punch!
In three days, we'll either be victorious at Torgau, or we shall die.
Well?
According to the latest news, we face 65,000 Austrians.
Oh, "W!
20,000 would be more dangerous.
For 65,000, the space is much too small.
General Zieten believes, Daun has a position that no one can penetrate.
I agree. No one can.
Daun lies behind the Siptitz Heights.
His position is surrounded by woods, ponds, banks, and impassable territory.
Nobody will get in. That's right.
But 65,000 in such a small space?
If we don't let them out, they'll step on each other's toes.
And that, Dessau, is why we must not let them out.
Because then they're lost.
We'll show them a battle of destruction like we haven't seen since Cannes.
The archetype of a battle of encirclement.
Colonel.
On the King's order,
Regiment of Bernburg falls into line with the left: wing of General Zieten.
Just leave me alone for three minutes.
Look, we don't have time. We don't have a church, nor do we have rings.
I'm not suited to be a minister at all.
But that's not that important.
Only love is important.
Well, put your hands together.
So, now we beg our dear God that your husband will get out alive from this dirty war.
And you, Luise, be a good soldier's wife.
Well, that's it.
Now hurry up. Join your company.
Sergeant Treskow, everyone's ready to march in 10 minutes.
Paul!
Paul!
I've embroidered it all day.
It came out beautiful, Luise.
At least I have something from you.
Now it can start again.
I'm with you, too.
- I'll always be with you. Right, Paul?
- Yes.
- Ensign! Tie it to the rifle!
- Fine.
Luise, today we'll get our honor back.
Your honor.
As long as you come back.
Come, now.
We have to celebrate our wedding, right, Luise?
Hold the rifle!
Are you really crying, little Luise?
That's so nice.
Let's walk on a little.
I've never experienced that.
No one was crying over me when it started.
Two! Three! Four!
Now you have to stay here, all right?
It's starting to get ticklish.
Bye, my wife.
Take care, Paul.
Can you read the clock on the spire?
5:40, Your Majesty.
We'll take the same way back.
Exactly at 6:15,
Zieten shall start the attack.
Hurry up! HUFFY "P!
Adjutant von Weber, go to General Zieten at once.
Take the bugler with you and deliver the King's order.
Zieten shall start the attack at 6:15 sharp. Repeat.
On the King's order, General Zieten shall start the attack at 6:15 sharp.
Take the shortest way through the heathland, over the small bridge by Radenthein.
Be careful. The whole area is covered with Austrians.
Should you get cutoff, immediately give the signal to attack.
No matter, where you are.
Hurry up.
- Herr Rampen!
- Your Excellency?
Your Excellency.
I'm under the impression that His Majesty doesn't need us.
Go and ask courteously when we'll receive our pension.
At the Chamber of Commerce in Potsdam, Your Excellency?
Something is wrong here.
I'm telling you, something is wrong here.
'Fume?
It strikes 6:00, Your Excellency.
Yes, 6:00.
It strikes 13:00, my friend.
Order of General Zieten!
A reliable man has to go down to the road between Siptitz and Grotitz.
Siptitz and Grotitz?
And signal the arrival of the King's adjutant.
- Take a bugler with you! Hurry up!
- Yes, Colonel!
Make sure the road is clear of the enemy!
Order for General Zieten.
But hurry up.
Stupid nonsense.
We're waiting here, pinned down like apes.
No adjutant. No signal.
What's His Majesty thinking?
You! Lay down!
But these guys are Austrians.
Rochow said the road was clear.
- It was just a patrol.
- More men!
That's a whole regiment.
Might as well be five regiments.
We're only the advance party.
Let's hurry back to Zieten.
Look!
They're lining up to attack.
They're coming at us from behind.
Go! Blow!
Are you crazy? I'm supposed to blow when the adjutant arrives.
How is he supposed to come on this road now, you idiot?
Blow!
I won't be court-martialed?
Give me that junk, you idiot!
Thank God!
The signal to attack!
Let's play up these Imperials!
- Where is General Daun?
- What's going on?
The Prussians are attacking from all sides.
All roads are closed off.
Then let's fire all 400 cannons.
Until they smolder.
Have you ever heard fire like this?
It's like Judgment Day.
Like the trombones of death.
For Heaven's sake! My King!
Directly beneath the heart.
What are you doing with me?
Can you not be of real use?
But His Majesty is injured.
- Nonsense!
- His Majesty is bleeding!
That's a shameless accusation,
I'm telling you!
The King is not injured.
Give me my hat!
The bullet that kills me will come from up there.
Forward!
To victory!
We won!
We won!
We won!
Victory, Your Majesty, victory!
The King has won at Torgau!
We have destroyed 65,000!
I embrace you and all your brave Prussians.
Stronger hearts don't exist.
The banners of victory, Your Majesty.
The old Prussian banners.
Goebelin, Hohenfriedberg, Leuthen, and now the banner of Torgau, too!
Zieten.
Your majesty-
Your Majesty, the Regiment of Bernburg is waiting.
Regiment of Bernburg.
Brave men!
All is forgiven and forgotten!
But today I will never forget!
Long live our Fritz!
One! Two! Three!
Long live our Fritz!
Paul!
Paul!
Paul!
Paul!
Little Luise!
Paul!
Little Luise!
- Paul!
- Luise!
The King said all is forgiven and forgotten!
Be quiet.
I love you.
The adjutant fell?
By Grotitz?
Nonsense!
How then did you receive the order to attack?
I received the signal, Your Majesty.
From the adjutant?
How is that possible, if the adjutant fell by Grotitz?
Sergeant Treskow of the Regiment of Bernburg had orders to wait for the adjutant at the junction of Siptitz and Grotitz, because he was running late.
He was supposed to give a signal as soon as the adjutant arrived at the junction.
So what?
Did he, perhaps, give the order to sound for attack?
Are you not going to answer, gentlemen?
A sergeant gave the signal to attack?
In his sole discretion?
Silence!
A present from the 5th Company!
See, Luise?
Now you're a real soldier's wife.
Custom made.
Short-waned.
Like a general!
Just be careful that she doesn't start wearing pants, too.
I am so happy, Paul.
I am so happy-
- Sergeant Treskow?
- Here!
Go to Colonel Rochow at once!
Sergeant.
You had the order to signal the arrival of the King's adjutant.
Did you give the order to sound for attack?
- No, Colonel--
- No?
- Is that Sergeant Treskow?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
And he denies giving the order?
You did not give the order to sound for attack?
No, Your Majesty.
I blew the bugle for attack myself.
How could you?
I knew it was against His Majesty's orders for us to get attacked.
And, therefore,
I blew the bugle for attack.
Without an order?
The Austrians were going to attack us from behind.
Did you also know that wasn't according to the King's plan?
No, Your Majesty.
Well, it wasn't according to my plan.
The battle could have taken a different course.
Only that saves you from instant execution.
You'll be tied to the wheel for three days.
Guard.
Arrest the Sergeant.
Sergeant Treskow will be promoted to Lieutenant.
But he has to do the three days.
Discipline is necessary.
Nevertheless,
I reward determined and independent actions of my soldiers.
And what happens to me if the artillery leaves tomorrow?
Then you'll walk after us for three days.
Tied down like a dog.
No, Colonel.
Not with me!
Get away from here!
Move on, rabble!
If the adjutant would have given the signal, he would have been highly decorated.
But our kind will be tied to the wheel.
No, no.
Here ends the love of the fatherland.
Be reasonable, Treskow.
You don't even know what the King has planned for you.
- You don't understand him.
- I don't want to understand.
I don't need to understand.
God knows
I've always been for the King.
I would have let myself be cut into pieces for him.
Don't make yourself unhappy now that you just got married.
Easy for you to say.
He took me away, straight from my wedding party!
Treskow, you forget yourself.
Far from it, Colonel.
I bethink myself.
Until now, I had forgotten myself.
We fought like lions at Kunersdorf, and he took away our bands and our honor.
And now after Torgau, he has me tied to the wheel.
No, no.
AT THE RUSSIAN HEADQUARTERS
IN TORUN
Thank God!
Now this nonsense is finally over!
A little moresavoir-faire gentlemen.
The Czarina is dead.
Long live the Czar!
Long live the Czar!
Without me, gentlemen!
I wonder, whether the young gentlemen will remain as enthusiastic when they find out we'll soon be allies of the Prussians.
I think, then more than ever.
The Russian Guard has often shown a fatal adoration for the commanding genius of the Prussian King.
And the Russian people?
They will not be asked.
But the priests will give their opinion without being asked.
They will preach it to the people from their lecterns.
Yes, you're right.
The clergy doesn't love him.
And the priests have always been the stronger ones.
Here, we would need
Peter the Great for that.
And not this one here.
To deal with such a dangerous opponent.
And Katharina, his wife?
It was a love match once.
Yes, it was.
But it's different today.
Yes.
If we follow the young Czar's orders, my dear General, it is absolutely in the realm of possibilities--
That we'll have to answer for our deeds in front of another regent.
That's what you mean, General, isn't it?
Yes.
We understand each other.
It's clear as daylight to me that the Czar's calculation doesn't add up.
He is half Russian.
He's not able to feel like a Russian, this former Duke of Holstein.
His absurd fondness for his enemy will entice him to become a copycat.
He'll try to turn us Russians into Prussians, dear Chernyshev.
That's why it is advisable to act with extreme caution and reservation.
What does that mean?
That we have to meet clear orders.
If we don't, we might have to go to bed one night with our head in our arms.
I have a proposal to make.
Russia is big, and the Czar is far away.
It's difficult to keep an eye on us.
Fortunately, it's two of us,
Chernyshev.
We separate, but still remain together.
You'll join Frederick with your 20,000.
Just tell him you're bringing 30,000.
He'll welcome you even more.
And I'll remain here, in Prussia, in Torun, with my 60,000 men.
We'll call it a stronghold against the Swedes.
What if Frederick wins?
Then we've secured East Prussia and Pomerania for him.
And what if he loses?
Then Russia will thank us, no matter who comes to the Czar's throne.
We'll return home with East Prussia and Pomerania as our loot.
Very good.
Stop!
Turn on the lights.
They're Russians.
They're negotiators.
I'd like to see the King of Prussia.
Take it easy, gentleman.
Take it easy.
I can't bring the first negotiator to the King of Prussia.
I won't negotiate with anyone else.
Well, come down then.
- What are you, anyway?
- Lieutenant!
That's your authentication,
Lieutenant?
That's an authentication for General Chernyshev.
Yes, well...
Please leave us alone, gentlemen.
I am General Chernyshev,
Your Majesty.
And why this guise, General?
The matter is important.
I wanted to show up myself.
And I was afraid, the notice of my presence would cause too much noise in the camp.
That's why...
Please have a seat, General.
Frankly speaking,
I've been expecting a message from my friend, Czar Peter III.
A message of peace, General.
I bring you more than that,
Your Majesty.
It is the first official act of my Imperial Master after the demise of her blessed
Majesty, Czarina Elisabeth, to not only offer you peace, but a military alliance, as well.
I'm bringing you 30,000 Russians.
To support me?
They're under the Supreme Command of Your Majesty!
Do you also snuff, General?
I'd like to hold it just once, the tin the world's talking about.
You like it? You may keep it.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Bless you, Your majesty!
When can I have the Russians?
Right away, Your Majesty.
It's starting to snow sooner than usual this year.
And Your Majesty doesn't want to experience a second winter camp like in Brusewiiz.
The Count von Finkenstein.
Pardon me, Your Majesty.
It is urgent.
Why are you here and not in the field?
I ask for your permission to excuse myself.
I will wait until His Majesty calls for me.
Is something wrong with Heinrich?
The Queen is asking Your Majesty to come to Berlin at once.
Prince Heinrich is sick.
Is he dead?
Finkenstein, don't lie to me.
No, Your Majesty, but the Prince is very sick.
What does he have?
What's the matter with him?
The smallpox.
Finkenstein, he is all I have left in this world.
He is the last one who has my heart.
He must not be taken from me.
Not to waste time, it would be best if Your Majesty would just take my carriage to go to Berlin.
No, you're going to Berlin.
I can't leave here.
Now less than ever.
This Russian with his grinning grimace is offering me his friendship.
They already dare to enter the lion's den.
How far it must have come,
Finkenstein, for them to think they can play with me so clumsily?
But if we really play cat and mouse here, I won't be the mouse.
Notify me of any changes.
His Majesty does not wish to see the Prince once more?
I am on duty!
Don't you want to talk?
I'm telling you, if you got me out of bed and ifs not important, you'll get a nasty surprise!
I only came to you, Colonel, because I'm at a complete loss.
But you've married us, and you've always been so kind.
Colonel, what happens to deserters if I...?
I mean, when you... catch them?
Who wants to desert?
Colonel, give me your word that you won't punish the deserters.
I'm supposed to give you my word not to punish deserters?
Yes.
Tell me, what did you even come here for?
I just don't want it to happen.
Do you think, it makes sense to beat around the bush like that?
Treskow?
Right?
Well, look at that.
He's sliding more and more.
Now he's tied to the wheel for the third time because he can't keep up his discipline.
He already threw away the promotion the King had planned for him.
And in addition to that, he's deserting.
Look at that.
Look at that.
- So, Paul Treskow wants to desert!
- No.
- What a coward.
- No, he is not a coward!
He just can't get over it that you've tied him to the--
Nonsense!
He can't get over it!
A lame excuse!
He heard we're attacking tonight!
And he wants to let his comrades attack by themselves!
Am I right?
But he is not even aware of that.
No one knows it's starting again tonight.
Arrest Treskow immediately!
Keep that woman from running away!
Guard!
Hurry UP!
Go! Before the guard returns!
Go! What are you waiting for?
I've been tied to that wheel for so long, a minute doesn't count at all.
But every second counts!
If they find us with these clothes, they'll shoot us!
Don't get so worked up.
Worked up? This is about our life!
Goddamn life!
A deserter's life!
Well, I don't want to get shot!
Not me!
Or do you already regret that I cut you loose?
You've lost your guts, have you?
See, God damn it?
Someone's coming.
Paul!
What are you doing?
Take that thing off!
Paul.
It's starting again tonight.
You can't let the others go alone.
What does that mean,
"It's starting again tonight“?
You're supposed to attack.
Without us!
Treskow, don't slow yourself down!
Why?
How do you know that?
From Rochow.
Then I'll go alone!
That idiot's beyond help!
This woman will be your misfortune!
Well, tie me up again.
They're already after you.
They'll be here soon.
Here they are already.
Well, that was close.
Or, to tell the truth, your wife was your guardian angel.
I don't want the Colonel to think I'm a coward.
I'm not a coward, Colonel.
I ask for my punishment, Colonel.
Is General Chernyshev in the castle?
General Chernyshev is having dinner with the King.
Announce me, then.
- I'm not sure I can do that.
- I can't wait.
I come with urgent and secret instructions.
Very well, then. I'll try.
After you.
Long live my sublime friend,
Czar Peter III.
We've completely forgotten how to celebrate festivities.
Well, we also have a few years of hunger behind us in Prussia.
I have invited you to a prosperous table not for the unimportant reason that I live to see my 50th birthday today...
Oh, Your majesty- but for a feeling of appreciation towards my high guests who have placed the great surprise of their-- if very tardily recognized-- friendship on the birthday table.
I've decided to decorate
Your High Sovereign with the Black Eagle First Class.
I enjoy doing so even more, since the main part of the Russian expedition army, under the supreme command of the reliable General Saltykov, exerts itself for the protection of this old country of origin of the Black Eagle decoration so conspicuously.
I am sure I can't give greater pleasure to my Monarch, than being the bearer of this message and this illustrious decoration.
Yes?
A message for General Chernyshev.
Please.
An express courier from General
Saltykov is expecting to see him.
I ask Your Majesty to excuse me.
I'll be back immediately.
Please go ahead, General.
Dessau.
You are responsible for General Saltykov's courier to remain with us as our guest.
As you command, Your Majesty.
The Czar assassinated?
Catherine, Empress of Russia.
Catherine II.
This came about faster than I thought.
What is Saltykov saying?
I was ordered to press you to hurry along.
The order for General Saltykov, and you, General, is the first official act of the new government.
How am I supposed to do that?
How am I supposed to retract 20,000 men without the King noticing?
How do they imagine that in Petersburg?
General Saltykov advises the General to be careful.
Do they know in Petersburg this is the eve of a crucial battle for the King?
That if he should win, the whole free army will be after me?
What's the advice I shall bring to General Saltykov?
Well, tell him I will try to isolate my troops in a way that the Prussians will lose control over my movements.
And then, as soon as the Prussians show any signs of weakness,
I will change sides to the Austrians.
That's all I can do.
It's my mission to go from here via byways to the Austrian headquarters, and inform General Daun about our standby.
Very well then.
I agree with General Saltykov.
Hurry UP-
I'll have fresh horses prepared for you.
Attention!
The Russian courier will be assigned to a quarter on the top floor.
He'll be guarded by four men and is not allowed to leave the room.
At your command.
You're liable for it with your head.
It was meant to be worn on a heart which now is no longer beating.
My friends are leaving me.
To send the decoration to the widow of the deceased, as we normally do, seems to be out of place in this case.
What's your opinion, General?
Oh, well...
Since you don't share new information with me, that you've certainly received from your new government,
I assume our relationship remains unaffected by the tragic circumstances.
Yes, Your Majesty.
That's right.
Of course, Your Majesty.
How diplomatic and loyal, General.
Well?
Too bad your officers don't seem to have the same attitude as you, General.
Why, Your Majesty?
I had the General's courier assigned to a quarter in the house.
He preferred to violently check out of his room.
My guard acted according to duty.
He was shot.
How could His Majesty order to shoot a courier of my Czarina?
The fact he tried to leave the castle by force absolutely justifies my actions.
Good to know
I can be sure of your attitude.
You relieve me of the awkward duty to communicate to my army that we house the enemy within our own camp.
But for reasons of security,
I have to ask for your épée.
Your Majesty -
Here, have it.
The battle will be over in three days, then you will get your épée back.
I will have the order that was given for the Russians to attack cancelled.
Since the circumstances have changed,
I certainly won't ask the Russians to fight for me.
But their position to march, dear General, has to be maintained in pretense so Daun still expects their attack and will only turn half of his force towards me.
After the battle, you may travel accompanied by my best wishes and my best regards to your new Empress.
For God's sake, does he not go to sleep?
No.
He broke the habit of sleeping.
This guy's better off.
He's able to sleep.
And after all, he's only a servant.
When he stops pacing, it's almost like something is missing.
It's like a clock that stops ticking.
This book belongs to Heinrich, the Prince of Prussia.
“This book belongs to Heinrich, the Prince of Prussia. "
Is someone there?
Is someone here?
No, Your Majesty.
Just the guard.
Still no messenger from Berlin?
No, Your Majesty.
What time is it?
Almost 2:00 in the morning,
Your Majesty.
Wake me as soon as the courier arrives.
Yes, Your Majesty.
When did it happen?
At 2:00 in the morning.
That's terrible.
And the King?
What does he say?
I don't even want to know.
And especially now, just before the attack.
Too bad.
Well, goodbye.
When you see him, Zieten, no condolences, no word about it.
Certainly not.
- Your Majesty?
- General von Zieten.
General von Zieten.
General von Zieten.
You have the custody of Prince Frederick Wilhelm, who will be my successor one day.
I had different plans.
But Our Lord, who you carry on about,
Zieten, has dashed my hopes.
Even the pain, Your Majesty, shall not make the man impudent.
God's ways are not our ways.
Impudent?
Are you calling me impudent, Zieten?
Are you aware of what I have lost?
What your God has taken from me?
Your Majesty is better versed in Greek literature than I am.
Whom the Gods love, they call home sooner.
Then I'll be 1,000 years old, Zieten.
They sure don't love me.
Not the Greek, nor the Roman, nor Zieten's Gods.
I wrote the Prince to join us in the field.
Read the letter, forward it, and take care of the Prince.
I resent him, that bastard.
Frankly speaking.
And one thing I bar you from, Zieten.
You're supposed to teach military classes, not religious classes.
Go, old friend, you understand me.
If Your Majesty believes
I can turn the Prince into a king--
He'll never be that.
That's something you don't become, but something you are.
Goodbye.
I am busy.
And ask Colonel Rochow to come in.
He keeps lingering around the house like a cat beating around the bush.
But I have to talk to the King!
I have to!
You silly girl.
Anybody could ask.
This gambler is under arrest?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Execute him at once.
And then chase the woman away.
And this... . What's his name?
Sergeant Treskow.
Right, Treskow.
What's going on with him?
He used to be my best soldier,
Your Majesty.
Until Torgau.
I know. I know.
Who is that woman down there?
Sergeant Treskow's wife.
Tears?
Tears everywhere.
They even cry about someone like that.
A deserter without honor.
He is not without honor.
It was exactly his violated sense of honor that became his misfortune.
I plead for my Sergeant, Your Majesty.
I'd like to talk to Treskow, but there is no time now.
After the attack.
Paul!
Paul!
Paul!
Forward, Ensign.
Tauentzien shall point all his cannons at the gun powder depot of Schweidnitz!
Your majesty-
Remain seated.
Who is that?
Sergeant Treskow reports to the cemetery.
Paul!
Well, Treskow.
Goodbye, my comrade.
Goodbye.
To all my dead soldiers.
Berlin
March 30, 1763
Our Prussians!
Where is the King?
If he would only come.
If he would only come at last.
A message from His Majesty, the King.
His Majesty has interrupted his travel to stop over in Kunersdorf.
He will not arrive here before late afternoon.
So write it down, and let me know how much rye you need to bake enough bread for the whole village.
And with it, how many horses and cows and seeds for the summer crop.
And send it to me in Berlin.
Who rebuilt the mill over there?
All of us, Your Majesty.
Ah, it's you.
Who is the miller?
I am, Your Majesty.
Do you stand all by yourself now?
No, Your Majesty.
I stand alone.
The bells toll. I hear the fireworks.
He must be in Berlin.
The Berliners cheer for him,
Your Majesty.
Did you also do that after Kunersdorf?
I ask Your Majesty to change carriages.
Into the Royal carriage?
No, you can't ask me to do that.
My Generals, you have represented me so often and with such honor,
I can't think of anyone who would be better suited to accept the gratitude of the people.
Charlottenburg!
Shut the door.
Is Your Majesty expecting the Queen and the Royal Suite?
Let's begin.
Is Your Majesty alone?
Yes.
BLACK EAGLE
OF FREDERICK THE GREAT,
LIKE THE SUN YOU COVER
THE DESERTED AND HOMELESS
WITH YOUR GOLDEN WINGS
[ Man ] All right, men,
time to go wolfhuntin'
How's it look?
[ Both Chattering ]
- [ Fiddle ]
- [ Man Singing, Indistinct ]
 This is the song
they sing 
Hey, get along
Get along Josey 
Hey, get along
Jim along Joe 
Hey, get along
Get along Josey 
Hey, get along
Jim along Joe 
Watch your turns.
[ Continues ]
Ladies, bow.
Gents,you know how.
Do-si-do
and around you go.
Sure was nice of you and your father to come over tonight, Miss Webb.
Oh, it was nice of you asking us.
We been intendin'to-- Ma has,
I mean-- to come visiting,
you bein'new folks here.
Well, we've been wishing you would.
[ Skillet Scraping ]
[ Continues ]
Looks like the Kents are merrymaking.
Let's see if we can't help 'em celebrate.
[ Continues ]
[ Caller ]
Oh,yeah.!
- Stop the music.
- [ Music Stops ]
[ Wolf Howling ]
[ Growls ]
That's what we've been told not to do.
Now put that back... and get your mother and the other women and children down into the storm cellar.
- [ People Chattering ]
- Dad, what is it?
- Mr. Webb, would you go to the barn and let the horses out?
- Certainly.
[ All Shouting, indistinct ]
- Ma!
- [ All Talking At Once ]
[ Chattering ]
Be careful now.
Don't--
- [ Ma ] Be careful of those steps.
- What is it?
- it's a raid.
- But why?
- They hate us. We're Mormons.
Go on. Hurry now.
- Mormons?
Hey.! Here's one.!
- Come on out, Mormon.
- Get out here and find out... what the state of illinois thinks of you.
Come on, come on.
- [ Door Slams ]
- [ Footsteps ]
Cut me some firewood.
Has-Has anything like this ever happened before?
Five years ago in Missouri.
Just because you people are Mormons?
Just because we're Mormons.
- [ Crying ]
- No.
[ Gunshot ]
[ Gunshots ] i got one of their Mormon bibles.
Let's make 'em spit on it.
- Make him spit on it.
- Spit on it.
- Stuff it down his throat.
- Go on! Spit on it!
''Blessed be ye when men revile you and say all manner of evil things about you for my sake.''
Don't ''blessed'' us!
Come on out of there!
- Ma, they set the house on fire.
- Oh!
Now hide in the fields until they're gone. Hurry! Quick!
This is what you can expect if you don't clear outta here.
Why are you doing this?
We only want to live in peace with everyone.
[ Grunts ]
[ Ma ]
Oh!
Caleb!
Oh, Caleb.
Dad!
Dad!
[ Crying ]
[ Screams ]
My father, Caleb Kent.
- How?
- Beaten to death.
[ Man ]
Jasper Palmer.
- How?
- Beaten.
Well, what are you gonna do about it, stand back and pray... while they drive us out of another state?
The Lord works in strange ways.
Sure, but that didn't prevent him turning Samson loose... on those Philistines with the jawbone of an ass, did it?
What those fellas need is a little lead in their bellies.
- if you say the word, i'll--
- Tear them limb from limb. i know.
- That's what they're itching for.
- Our people have had enough trouble without that.
They can't stand much more,
Joseph. They can't stand to pull up stakes and move again.
Let's settle this the wise way then.
Give them the political power they want. Vote the way they say to vote.
[ Man ] Yeah.
Let them use that power to destroy us.
The authorities will protect us if we do as they say. i wouldn't trust them any further than i can chuck a mule.
We can't take any more chances, start all over.
We've got the biggest city in illinois to protect.
Promise them anything they want, only let's have peace.
What do you say, Hyrum?
A man has a right to fight for his own life.
And you, Heber?
Seems like we'll have to.
Otherwise they'll drive us clear out of the United States.
All my life, i've asked only one thing of my neighbors-- to be left alone in peace.
We've stuck to that in every state we've been in.
- But i guess it won't work.
- What?
You may be right, Angus, but perhaps it's time... for us to show a different kind of courage... and do something besides be killed for what we believe.
Tell the people i said to arm themselves.
- That's treason.
- That if there's any more raiding... we're going to fight back.
Tell them i'm going to lead them myself. if they haven't got guns, get guns for them.
Tell them we're through turning the other cheek.
Hallelujah!
What's the difference between a white man and a Mormon?
- Blamed if i know.
- About 50 wives.
[ All Laughing ]
[ Man ]
There he is...
the man that says
he talks to God.
A man so eaten
with pride and ambition...
that even the word ''treason''
holds no horror for him.
A prophet and saint who walks up to God... anytime he feels like it, whispers in his ear... and gets talked back to--
Joseph Smith.
Now, gentlemen, you've heard the evidence.
Of all that,
I need say no more.
However... i would hold myself no better than a skunk... if i did not bring up a matter... which is the very heart and core of this case-- to wit, the teachings ofJoseph Smith.
[ All Shouting, indistinct ]
Quiet down!
Quiet! Quiet!
Order!
Go ahead, Pete.
Joseph Smith, a half-educated boy just like you or me... brought up in a two-by-four town called Palmyra... in New York state... has the unmitigated nerve to stand up and say...
God told him to rewrite the Holy Bible... because it's full of errors--
errors, mind you--
and to go out and preach...
that all churches
are an abomination
in the sight of the Lord...
except this one... that God told him personally... to go out and get an army to run.
Give him a trumpet, and i bet he'd say he's Gabriel hisself.
- [ Shouting, indistinct ]
- Oh, wait a minute!
Go on and sit down.
And remember, this is a court of law and justice.
The self-respectin' people of three states--
New York, Ohio and Missouri--
God bless 'em... have already told Joseph Smith to pack up and git.
But has that stopped him?
Oh, no!
He's come all the way here to illinois to save us.
And what does he do?
He buys himself a swamp hole for almost nothing... and builds himself a town called Nauvoo... and sends his missionaries all over the world to tell people...
God set our land aside as their inheritance.
Before long, they'll own every stick and stone in illinois... fill every public office, run every church and school... unless we get rid of them!
Your Honor, the prosecution rests.
[ All Cheering ]
Order in the court!
- [ Crowd Chattering ]
- Has the defense anything further to offer?
Your Honor, if there's no objection, i'd like to say something.
- [ Shouting, indistinct ]
- [ Bell Clanging ] i say we all let him say what he's got to say!
Let yourself go, Brigham.
Your Honor, my name is Brigham Young.
- i'm not a lawyer, but--
- Never mind that. Go ahead, talk.
All right.
Go ahead.
Gentlemen, it looks to me like there's been a little mistake made here.
The lawyer for the other side has been so busy... trying to pin every crime on the calendar on Joseph Smith... he clean forgot to mention that us folks was the victims of all those outrages... he was talking about, not the ones that were doing them.
Sure, we finally got around trying to protect ourselves.
You push even a coyote up in a corner, and he'll snap back at you.
That's the first time
I ever heard it called treason though. in other words, the whole point is... whetherJoseph Smith or any other American citizen... has a right to worship God as he chooses.
So that's why i figured i'd like to tell you a little bit aboutJoseph Smith.
Now, me,
I'm just an ordinary everyday fellow. i used to farm a little, do a little carpentry work... painting-- anything to make a living.
But all that time, i was trying to find the right church... for me and for my family, and i was willing to give them all a try.
But somehow none of them hit me just right. i'm not saying, gentlemen, there was anything wrong with them for other people. i'm just saying they didn't suit me.
One day i picked up
The Book of Mormon...
and I said to my friend
Heber Kimball...
''Heber, let's go out to Ohio and see this prophet.
Let's see what he's got to say for himself.'' i remember it was about noon we came up toJoseph Smith's house... and his wife Emma came to the door. and his wife Emma came to the door.
Excuse me, ma'am, is this whereJoseph Smith lives?
- Yes.
- We'd like to talk to him, please.
You'll find him out yonder, the other side of the lake, chopping wood.
Thank you, ma'am.
That sounds kind of funny for a prophet to be out swinging an ax.
- Don't seem just right.
- Prophet ought to act like a prophet.
Can't expect to build a church if he acts like a farmhand.
Good morning.
How do you do, sir? i'm Brigham Young.
- This is my friend Heber Kimball.
- i'm glad to meet you.
We've come a long ways to see you.
We want to ask you some questions about your church.
Gladly. i'd like to tell you about it.
Won't you sit down?
What's this about you folks calling yourselves saints?
Well, we believe that any man, dead or alive... who keeps the Ten Commandments is a saint.
You don't pretend to be the Lord himself, do you?
No. i'm just a mortal man, same as you or your friend here.
Well, this plan of yours you call the United Order, what's that? it's not my plan. it's the Lord's.
Well, whose ever it is, what is it?
Well, i-- i suppose you'd call it the law of nature.
You see, it's his idea that the land of Zion will be sort of like a beehive... or like that anthill over there... with everybody doing his share of the work... and getting his part of the profits.
Aplace where everybody
will have everything
he can eat and use.
There'll be great storehouses
to keep food and things in...
There'll be great storehouses
to keep food and things in...
for the sick and the poor,
the old folks.
You see, under a brotherhood plan like that... it'll be impossible for any one man to pile up a lot of goods... or have power over his neighbors.
That'll mean there'll be no social distinctions... no caste, no special privileges. any more than, i take it, there is in that anthill over there.
We had it once, but somehow we've all but lost it.
We've got to get back to it again.
Well, that--
That sounds all right.
But then there'll always be lazy people, ambitious people.
There'll be some honest ones and some dishonest ones.
What i'm telling you,
Brother Brigham, is a revelation from the Lord. it's up to us to work it out.
This isn't an easy religion.
Well, i'm not looking for an easy religion. i'm looking for one i can bring my family up decent in.
Joseph.
Dinner is ready.
Won't you stay and have dinner with us?
[ Young ]
Well, thank you. We'd be glad to.
All right.
Come on.
Now, gentlemen, i'm not asking you to believe... a single thing
Joseph Smith said... but i do ask you-- let him believe it.
Let me believe it if we want to.
Your forefathers and mine came to this country in the first place... for one great reason-- to escape persecution for their beliefs... and to build a free country where everybody might worship God as he pleased.
That's what brought the Puritans to Massachusetts... the Quakers to Pennsylvania... the Huguenots to South Carolina, the Catholics to Maryland.
And when they found what they were after... they fought a great war to hold on to it... and they drew up one of the noblest documents ever written-- the Constitution of the United States-- to govern free men.
And the very first words they put on that piece of paper... guarantees to every man... the right to worship God as he pleases... and prohibits Congress or anybody else... from ever doing anything to take away that right.
You can't convict
Joseph Smith just because... he happens to believe something you don't believe.
You can't go against everything your ancestors fought and died for.
And if you do, your names-- notJoseph Smith's-- will go down in history as traitors.
They'll stink in the records... and be a shameful thing on the tongues of your children.
Thank you, sir.
The jury can go out now and decide.
[ Whispering ]
[ Man, Shouting ]
Hey,Joe!
Hey,Joe!
Give it to 'im!
- What are ya waitin' for?
- [ People Chattering ]
We don't have to go out,

Sheriff, take charge of the prisoner.
- Have him here tomorrow morning at 1 1 :00 for sentence.
- Yes, sir.
-Joseph, if you'll say the word--
- You'll do nothing of the sort.
- i'm going with you,Joseph.
- So am i.
Come on.
Joseph, i'm going too.
This is the end. i want you to stay and take care of my people.
Don't look so solemn,
Brigham.
Only the Lord God of israel can whip us... and i don't think he's in cahoots with the sheriff.
[ Man ]
There he is.! Here comes HolyJoe.!
[ Crowd Laughing,Jeering ]

How about a couple
of miracles,Joe?

[ Shouts Continue ]
The Lord God of israel has spoken.
Verily i say unto you that one will be raised up to take my place... endowed with courage, farsightedness, common sense--
[ Glass Shatters ]
He will lead my people... even as Moses led the children of israel across the wilderness.

[ All Shouting, indistinct ]
[ Knocking On Door ]
We thought we'd just come over and see how you were getting along.
Won't you come in?
- i'm going away.
- Where to?
You see, i have an aunt back in New York-- not really my aunt, but just by marriage--
- and i wrote her and asked her--
- We came hopin' you'd come over and stay with us.
Oh, thanks just the same, but i-- i'm afraid i couldn't do that.
We'd sure like to have you if you could.
We thought, seeing you lost your father had something to do with us--
- Oh, but i'm not a Mormon.
- That wouldn't make any difference.
But i-- i just don't understand. it's been so terrible, all this hating and killing.
- it won't always be like that, Zina.
- i couldn't stand it. i've just got to get away.
[ Sobbing ]
Oh, well. Now, now.
You come over and stay with us.
[ Crying ] i don't know hardly what to do.
Well, now, you can stay for a little while.
And then a little later, after you're getting to feeling better... then you can decide.
[ Crying ]
[ Rooster Crows ]
[ Hammering ] i'm afraid you folks are making a sad mistake... fixin' to run off and leave a fine farm like this... when there's no sense to it.
Brigham Young thinks there's sense to it. Gettin' ready to leave by spring.
What Brigham Young thinks and what the Lord says are two different things.
Brother Duncan has been picked to takeJoseph's place as prophet.
- Duncan?
- He's had a revelation.
What does Brigham Young say about your being head of the church?
As i told you before, what Brigham Young says and what the Lord says... are two different things.
Everyone knows thatJoseph wanted me to take his place. i was his chief counsel long before Brigham Young ever came along.
- i stood up for him.
- Like Brigham stood up for him in court you mean?
He'd never have been in court in the first place if he hadn't listened to fool advice. i warned him what would happen raising an army instead of compromising.
''Compromising''?
Listen. i stood right here in this yard and saw my father-- who'd never hurt anybody in all his life-- beaten to death...
Zina's father shot down in cold blood.
And you sit there and talk about compromising.
I'd rather be shot down
than go crawling on my belly...
asking a lot of murderers
to let me alone.
And i don't believe that the Lord said anything to you at all. if he picked anyone to be head of this church, it was Brigham Young.
And if Brigham tells me to stay here and fight, that's what i'm gonna do.
And if he tells me to pack up and go on somewhere else,
that's what i'm gonna do.
And there's nothing you or anybody else can say that'll stop me.
Can't anything stop me any more than it could stop my father... from saying he believed in Joseph Smith even if he knew he'd be killed for it. if you're in such a hurry to talk about compromising... you'd better get on your way right now.
Come on, Ma.
Eliza, i've always thought a lot of you and your husband... so i won't hold this against you.
Good day.
[ Hammering Metal ]
Young fella's got quite a temper, ain't he?
Brigham Young put him up to it.
You mark my words.
Who's that girl there with 'em? i never saw her before.
Must be an outsider.
Jonathan!
Jonathan! Look!
They're headed for Nauvoo.
You'd better get out the back way.
Looks like our runnin' days are over.
- Hallelujah.
- [ Knocking On Door ]
- Brigham Young?
- Yes, sir.
- Come right in.
- Thank you.
Young?
- How do you do, sir?
- How do you do? i've come over here to warn you.
You'd better get your people out of here just as fast as you can.
- Why?
- Because i've held off those mobs as long as i'm able.
From now on, i can't be responsible.
You mean you want us to leave everything we fought all our lives for? i mean, if you don't go and go quick... blood's going to run like water in the streets... and nothing i can do will stop it.
We're not budging one inch. i am sorry that's your answer... but i'm afraid the law can't help you much.
The law?
What law?
The law that lets a pack of scoundrels come in here... and hunt us down like wild animals?
Burn our homes,
ruin our crops?
Arrest our leader on trumped-up charges... and then looks the other way when a mob breaks in and murders him?
They call that law, let 'em keep it.
We don't want any more of it. i appreciate this warning, Major, but, no, this time... we're going to stand up for our rights if it kills us.
You tell that bunch of hoodlums that i said... if they come over here again, we're going to fight... clear down to our boots and up to our necks in blood.
You mean that, don't you?
- Do you doubt it?
- No.
Then i guess that's all we've got to say to each other.
- Good day, sir.
- Good day.
Funny thing that major taking it for granted that i was the head of the church.
Why didn't he go to Angus Duncan?
He's been going around from house to house... telling everybody he's been picked to run things.
Still, if i'm the head, why doesn't the Lord tell me so?
One thing's certain-- somebody's got to be head pretty soon... or there won't be any church left to be head of.
[ Thunder Rumbling ]
[ Thunder Rumbling ]
[ Thunder Continues ]
You'd better put this around you.
Brigham, they're over at the council hall meeting--
Duncan and Crum and the others.
They found out that the raids are gonna start all over again tonight.
Duncan says they're not gonna listen to you anymore.
They're gonna make peace with those people over in
Carthage any way they can.
Well, maybe he is head of the church.
Maybe it's up to him.
Brigham. i stood here in Joseph's footprints. i knelt where he did... trying as hard as i know how to get an answer... but the Lord won't talk to me.
He won't tell me what to do one way or the other.
He didn't say you were
not to head the church, did he?
He didn't say anything.
Brigham, when you asked me if i loved you... i didn't say anything either... but that didn't mean i didn't love you.
Sometimes silence is the best answer you can give a person.
Mary Ann,Joseph told me to run this church... and i'm going to run it the way it ought to be run until the Lord says no.
[ Thunder Rumbles ]
[ Duncan ] We're headed for
the worst trouble we've
ever had this very night...
unless we act
and act quick.
[ Man ] Minute they heard what
Brigham said about fighting,
they started organizing.
[ Duncan ] i wish i'd have been there to hear him. i'd have shut him up quick enough.
He's acting as if the Lord chose him to run this--
How else should i act? i hear you've been making some sort of a deal with those rats over in Carthage.
Whatever it is, you're not going through with it... because i'm taking the bull by the horns and spitting in both his eyes.
- We're leaving here tonight.
- Tonight?
- We're crossing into iowa.
- You can't bluster your way into power. it might do you some good to know that the Lord said--
- We cross the river into iowa tonight.
- Was it a revelation?
Yes.
That's a lie.
Angus, i'd like awfully well to see you live to a ripe old age.
Maybe you will if you hold your tongue.
- But the river is frozen over.
- How else could we all cross it in one night?
- But it's fixin' to storm.
- They'll never expect us to start.
- We couldn't get our things.
- The lighter we travel, the better time we make.
Don't listen to him.
We can't run off now and leave everything.
- i've got my granary to think about.
- And my store.
Every cent i've got in the world is right here.
Maybe we're getting too interested in granaries and stores and things.
Remember how when Joseph started out, he had an idea about nobody getting rich... but everybody sharing alike?
Somehow his idea seems to have got sidetracked.
- i figure it's time we got back to it.
- But i've worked hard.
- i've saved and scrimped.
- if a little money means more to you than this church... you'd better stay here.
Heber, put some fellas on horses.
Tell them to spread the word.
Tell everybody to come just as they are.
We've got to put the river between us and Nauvoo by morning... or there won't be enough of us left to worry about.
[ Duncan ]
No, no. Wait a minute.
Don't pay any attention to him.
You're making a mistake.
Think of your homes.
You'll just be run out of this state like we've been run out of every other state.
Listen to me.
You're making a mistake.
[ Door Slams ]
Here he is.
They won't compromise.
They won't do anything.
They're leaving.
- Leavin'?
- Where are they going?
- They're crossing the river into iowa tonight.
- You're lyin'. it's the truth. Brigham Young's making them leave.
- And good riddance.
- Now you won't have to raid.
You better get over there and see that they don't change their minds.
- We'll fix it so that they'll never come back.
- You won't hurt my property.
- i did my best. i played fair.
- You're no better than any other Mormon.
Look, there's plenty else.
What about that promise?
You're not gonna destroy my granary. it's full of Mormon wheat, ain't it?
- [ Pulley Squeaking ]
- [ Man ] Take it easy.
- [ Pulley Squeaking ]
- [ Man ] Take it easy.
Let 'er go.
Come on.!
[ Man ]
Get on.! Hyah.!
All right, Mary Ann. i'll meet you down at the river.
Lord, Brigham's a great and good man. i'm his wife, and i know. i've known him longer than anybody but you and Heber Kimball.
Only sometimes he's so sure of himself.
Sometimes he's bullheaded and thinks nobody else knows a thing but him.
But he's only trying to do what's right.
So won't you look after him... maybe speak to him?
Because this is an awful thing he's asking us to do.
And right now, in his heart... he's not half as sure of himself as he makes out to be.
Everybody meet on the other side of the river.
Get together on the other side of the river. Everybody.
[ Men Whistling,
Shouting ]
Jonathan. Meet at Sugar Creek on the other side of the river.
Right.
[ Man ]
Giddap there.!
Giddap.! Hah.!
Giddap there.!
Ho.!
All right, go ahead.
Keep moving.
Supposin' the ice breaks through? i'll get my horse.
Let me try.
[ Bleating ]
Ho! Hie!
[ Gunshots ]
Hyah!
[ Gunshots Continue ]
Come on!
Get those wagons across the ice!
- [ Gunshot ]
- [ Man ] Get your children
in the wagons.!
- Eliza!
- Henry! Henry!
[ Gunshots Continue ]
Come on! Hurry up!
Watch where you're going.
Keep driving.
Get those wagons across the ice!
Well, if you ask me, it looks like the end of the Mormon Church.
Come on.
Mary Ann, look.
Looks like we've burned our bridges behind us.
Couldn't turn back now even if we wanted to.
- Get your tuba.
- Tuba?
And get hold of the rest of the band.
Tell them i said to start playing.
Yes, sir.
- Where are we going?
- Well, wherever it is, we'll get there.
[ Band Plays Hymn ]
[ Continues ]
[ Muttering, indistinct ]
Don't take it so hard,
Porter.
We'll build another city someday.
Who gives a hoot about a city?
My gun jammed. i didn't get to kill even one of them.
[ Rifle Clatters
On Ground ]
[ Cattle Lowing ]
Brigham, there ain't no sense tryin' to hide the truth.
Folks are as mad as wet hens, cussin' you all over the camp... claimin' you're to blame for gettin' them in all this misery.
Everywhere you turn, they're gettin' ready to pull out.
- Where to?
- Well, anywhere but here.
They don't seem to know, but they say they're awful fools... pullin' up stakes and leavin' everything they got... to come out here and squat in the mud and slop till they freeze.
- That's enough, Mary Ann.
- it's high time somebody did some thinkin' around here.
Why, there ain't 50 families in camp ain't got somebody sick or hurt or already dead. it's true, Brigham. i've been out all mornin'... and it pret' near breaks your heart just to look at 'em.
And they've got to know what you're gonna do about it.
Mary Ann, you and Clara get Emmaline and Lucy and some of the others... and help you take this stuff around to those that need it just as soon as you can.
Well, what are you gonna do about it?
Well, i've got an idea, but they're gonna need... some of this hot composition in their bellies before they hear about it.
[ Exhales Loudly ]
What in tarnation's that? it's one of Brigham's remedies to put down colds and ague... and fever and rheumatism and such.
What's in it besides fire?
Hot water and cinnamon bark and ginger root... and cayenne pepper and anything else that's hot.
Throw the stuff out. Ain't folks sufferin' enough without burnin' their insides out?
- Feel better?
- i'm all right, thanks.
- [ Baby Crying ]
- You better give her to me.
- it's past her feeding time.
- Oh, but you're not strong enough to.
She's hungry.
[ Fire Crackling ]
- How's Ma?
- She's feeding the baby now.
Hmm. Doc Richards said he'd be over in a minute.
Plenty more hurt. i wish he'd hurry up and come.
Zina, there's a family fixin' to pull out today... and i've arranged that you can go with them.
No, i'm not going. i couldn't leave your mother and the children... what with her hurt and everything.
- But we got no call on you.
- No, i-- i'll stay.
That's nice of you,
Zina.
Ma will appreciate that.
- How's your mother?
- You know Ma.
She doesn't complain.
She's a fine woman.
- New convert?
- No, sir. i'm not a Mormon.
- What are you doing here?
- Her father was killed the night they raided our place... and she's been staying with us ever since.
Well, i guess we can feed one more mouth.
Thank you, but that doesn't mean i'm going to be a Mormon.
- You don't seem to like Mormons.
- No, it isn't that.
But, well, it's just that i'm a Christian.
- So am i.
- Well, i mean, i've got my own religion. i wouldn't change that for anything or anybody.
And besides--
- ''Besides'' what?
- Well, there must be something wrong when there's so much hate... people being tortured, killed... everything they've got in the world taken away from them.
A lot of folks seem to think it worth going through all that for.
[ All Chattering ]
You folks have been doing a lot of worrying... and wanting to know what we're going to do next.
Well, in the first place, we're gonna start acting like we've got some common sense.
We're gonna build some strong new wagons, gather in all the food we can... get enough guns and ammunition, warm clothes and whatever else we need... and then we're gonna get out of here.
And we're gonna keep going until we're clear out of the United States...
across the Rocky Mountains
into Mexico.
- Hallelujah.
- Mexico? Across the Rocky Mountains?
When it's got to the place a man can't stay in the United States... and believe what he wants to, then he's got to get out.
- [ Man ] That's 1,500 miles.
Take us four years to get there.
- [ Young ]Just about. it took Moses 40 years to get where he was going.
- [ Man ]
But 1,500 miles.! We'd starve.!
- [ All Chattering ]
Doggone you, Brigham Young.
We've stood for all your foolishness we're aimin' to. i'm through, through with the whole dang setup. i'm quittin'. You understand?
Quittin' you and the church. i'm goin' someplace where me and my family can live.
[ All Chattering ] i know. i know it's not an easy thing i'm asking you to do.
But we can do it if we've got faith enough.
There's good stock here, Lord.
They're about as fine a bunch of men and women as ever lived.
All they need is a little bucking up... and a kick in the right direction so's-- so's they'll know their own strength.
And then you'll see how soon they'll stop all this infernal whining... and all this talk about running off, quitting the church.
First thing you know, they'll be letting their beards grow.
They'll be getting dirt
under their fingernails...
and calluses on their hands
as big as hoecakes.
And they'll be ready to whip
the tar out of the first fellow... that says we'll never make it. if there's anybody here doubts that, they'd better haul tail right now... because we don't want 'em.
We'll build our wagons, and we'll scratch for our food.
We'll shiver, and we'll go hungry if we have to.
And maybe some of us will keel over and die in our tracks... but that won't stop us neither.
Because the rest of us will keep going, and we'll never stop.
Never, not until we've found the place.
[ Young's Voice ]
Well, Lord, we're on our way.
Just as far as the eye can see,
they keep comin'
I doubt if there's been
anything to equal this...
since the children of Israel
set out across the Red Sea...
and you--
you had to open up the waters
to let 'em through.
And talk about miracles.
Just take a look at the way
some of these wagons
have hung together.
Of course, it took
plenty of scurrying around
to get together what we did.
But I knew that as soon
as we stopped arguin'..
and grumblin'about
what had to be done...
and started findin'ways
to do it, that we'd manage all right.
Some of our folks aren't really
in shape to travel.
Some, like Eliza,
with bullet holes in 'em.
Everybody,young or old,
has his or her work cut out.
The women are busy
sewing, mending, weaving...
or taking care of the babies,
doing the cooking.
And the men
who don't have to drive
or look after the livestock...
are turning out new shoes
and seeing that
our harnesses hold out.
And we don't aim to let
our children get far behind
in their lessons either.
Classes are being held
every foot of the way
so's it'll never be said...
that a Mormon
can't read and write
with the best of them.
[ Woman ]
Seventy-two--
Yes, sir, we're on our way.
Load your wagons and get ready to start.
There's only about five feet of water.
[ Man ]
Ho there.! it's all right,Jonathan.
We can make it. it's only about five feet deep.
Take care of him. it's only about five feet deep.
Come on!
[ Cattle Lowing ]
- Can you swim?
- No.
- You will.
- [ Screaming ]
[ Woman Screams ]
[ Screams ]
Whoa, boy!
[Jonathan ] All right.
Now straighten it out.
- There. All right.
- We should've built arks instead of wagons. if we had, we could've floated clear to the Rocky Mountains.
Has this wagon grown roots?
Angus, i didn't know you were here.
- Yep. in the mud with the rest of us.
- it's my church too, Brigham.
Sure it is. if we all push together, we'll get someplace.
- All right. All together.
- All together.
Heave! Heave!
[ Young ]
Lord, the way these sisters
swing an ax is a caution.
They go at it as if they had
the devil himself on the ground...
fixin'to lop offhis tail.
In the meanwhile,
we keepjogging along...
putting plenty
of good Iowa mud between us...
and those scoundrels
back in Carthage.
It's rough country
we're going through...
and it's just as hard
on the wagons as it is
on them inside.
Zina, come here.
What do you want? i want her to drive, Ma. i want to find Brigham.
Tell him we're gonna drop out for a little while.
We can catch up later.
- All this jolting--
- You keep going. if you let one stop, then somebody else will want to stop too.
Then a third and a fourth, and, before you know it... the whole shootin' match will be fallin' out. i don't want it said that we were the first to give up.
Not for anything.
Understand?
Zina, you go and sit with Jonathan. it ain't right you cooped up in here... and all that springtime outside.
Go on now, dear.
[ Young ]
We've been seeing Indians, Lord,
for several days now.
Sometimes there's just one.
Sometimes
there's two or three.
Sometimes a whole tribe
just lookin'
Porter Rockwell says that...
their main village
is up ahead at Council Bluffs...
and there must be a couple
of thousand around here
and with more comin'
Kind of gives you
a creepy feelin'..
knowing they've got
their eyes on you.
Some of our folks are getting
downright uneasy...
but I tell them,
''Indians can't be any worse...
than some Christians
I know. ''
Till we find out
a little bit more about them...
we mean to trust
in you, Lord...
and to keep
our powder dry.
Zigzagging. That means he wants to talk in peace.
You zigzag out to meet him.
My name's
Brigham Young.
We folks have been run out of our homes... and some of us are pretty tired and sick.
We'd like to stop in Council Bluffs for a while.
My people knows of your coming.
We know why you are here.
As Superintendent of indians, my advice is to say no.
Not many years ago, we were driven out of our homes.
You are welcome here.
Chief, those are the first words of real welcome... we've heard in 1 6 years.
And don't think we're going to forget them.
You can count on us for anything you want.
[ Young ]
We're welcome here!
We can stay here as long as we want to.
Unhook your oxen, turn them out to graze.
Clara. Mary.
We're welcome here.
We can stay as long as we want to.
Oh, i'm so glad,
Brigham.
Tell everybody to unhook their oxen and horses.
They can hunt too.
This country is running
over with wild game.
Look, Brigham, good, rich earth.
Sure.
Anything would grow here. i think i'll let the main body stay here and raise a crop.
The rest of us will push on and find someplace to settle in.
They can follow us later and bring whatever they've raised.
Tell the people the band's going to play tonight.
Tell them we're going to sing and dance like we used to.
First you tell us we can rest.
Now you say we have to dance. i bet i've lost a foot of belly since we started out.
- it's good for the figure.
- it looks good. i'm going to take a bath, even if i muddy up the whole dang river.
You'd better go now, because this afternoon you're going to be awful busy.
- Buryin'.
- Buryin'?
There's quite a few... counting the old folks, babies.
- Eliza Kent went this morning.
- Eliza?
Jonathan.
Why didn't you tell me about Eliza?
She didn't want me to.
None of them did.
She told me to tell you, Brigham... that even though we might be the last wagon... we'd never be the first to fall out. i just couldn't go away without leaving her some kind of marker.
You know,
Ma used to say... that a good wheel always sings.
Ma would've loved those flowers. i never saw a body so crazy about 'em.
Dandelion, ragweed,
any of'em.
Sonny, will you hold him?
- Hi.
- Howdy.
- Mind if i get a drink?
- Nope.
You one of them
Mormon fellas?
- Yes, we're Mormons.
- i heard you was coming.
Leaving off the ''mister,'' my name is Jim Bridger.
- What might yours be?
- Leaving off the ''mister,''
Brigham Young.
- Say, how many--
- Twelve.!
Hmm. How about a chaw to oil your tongue with?
No, thanks. i never use it.
How come?
What's the matter with you?
- You see this?
- Mm-hmm. i've been carrying that now for 1 5 years.
Whenever i feel myself tempted, i hold it up and say...
''Am i stronger than this tobacco or is this tobacco stronger than me?''
And I put it back
in my pocket. i'll be doggoned.
[ Children Shouting ]
- Little more?
- No, thanks.
You?
Yes, sir. it's all over California, i tell you.
And some of them nuggets are as big as the hub on a cart wheel.
Sounds like tomfoolery to me.
My brother ain't the tomfoolin' kind.
He wrote me all about it.
All you got to do is yank up a pea vine... scrape the ground with your finger and there it is.
Gold-- any way you turn, pretty and yellow...
- ready to buy anything you want.
- Don't go blabbing it around.
We don't want people talking about how rich she is... leastwise until we get California into the United States... now that we've been dragged into this war with Mexico.
[ Chuckles ]
Don't worry about us talkin'.
See that you don't talk to our people about it and get them upset.
We're not searchin' for gold.
We're searchin' for a place to live.
You don't have to worry about us either.
Well, thanks.
Good-bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
What's the matter with you?
Have you gone out of your mind? i don't think so. i had to hush those fellas up. i've just had a revelation.
There's gold in California.
Well, this is a revelation, and i think the church... is about to find a new leader.
As captains, each of you are in charge of 1 00 people. it's up to me and you to see that the Lord's will be done. if there's all that gold out in California... it seems strange and peculiar nobody's heard about it before.
The Lord chose when he wanted it known... and who he wanted to know it.
Now you brothers get busy.
Each of you know who you can trust in your own companies.
What's Brigham Young gonna say when he finds out about this?
The Lord will handle that too.
Zina.
- Zina, are you asleep?
- Uh-uh. Aren't you?
No. if you were asleep... i bet i could tell you what you'd be dreaming about.
- What?
- All that gold in California.
[ Sighs ]
Just imagine, Zina.
Chunks of it as big as oranges.
Wish i had an orange right now. i'd cut a hole in the stem for the baby to suck.
About the best thing there is for colic.
Gold.
You know, next to the Lord and maybe the land... i reckon it's about the most powerful thing there is.
Hmm.
What would you do with all that gold?
Oh, about a million things. i'd get a new saddle.
And i figure that the wagon needs a new doubletree.
Baby ought to have a cradle to rock in.
And you-- i'd get you a new dress and a hat.
Lots of boats come into California from China and everyplace... full of silk and things. i'd get you a parasol and shoes to match...
pretty finger ring--
lots of things, Zina.
All you got for yourself was a saddle.
Well, maybe i'll get me a horse to go under it.
Jonathan, suppose
Brigham Young doesn't want to go to California.
He couldn't help it. it's-- it's just like the promised land.
Zina?
You know what i've been thinking about?
Sounds funny, but... i've been lying here thinking about the time... before i got into long pants.
All the talking i used to do about... what i was gonna do as soon as i got into grown-up britches.
Now, I don't know, I--
I don't even care anymore.
Reckon the only thing i care about is... having somebody like me... likin' them and... just always bein' with 'em.
Zina.
Zina, seein' as you're so crazy about the children... and they're so crazy about you--
Well, i was just wondering if--
Course, i mean, after we get settled... and i get a crop goin' and some of that gold i was talkin' about.
Well, i was sort of hopin' that maybe you and me could, uh...
[ inhales, Exhales
Slowly ] get married.
Hmm? i told you to let me cook that stew.
- Sure was good stew though.
- Henry, shut up and go back to sleep.
- [ Crowd Clamoring ]
- [ Shouting ]
Ladies and gentlemen!
Ladies and gentlemen!
For the championship of Fort Bridger, a frog-jumping contest... between the defending champion...
- Jim Bridger...
- [ Cheers, Applause ] and the challenger...
- Porter Rockwell.!
- [ Cheers, Applause ]
- i'll bet you Porter wins.
- Bet what?
Oh, that new silk dress i'm gonna get against the horse you're gonna get.
Sounds like a fair bet.
[ Man Stuttering ]
G-G-Get set.!
T-T-T-Tickle 'em.!
[ Onlookers Shouting ]
Come on, Bridger!
Looks like you're not gonna get that dress you haven't got yet.
[ Shouting, Cheering
Continue ]
Dang saints, listen to 'em.
Gambling.
- They're only tryin' to have a little fun.
- Fun?
There's whiskey bein' drunk.
Porter Rockwell is chewing tobacco again.
- Since when did he ever stop?
- i'm not going to put up with it.
- i'll not have the devil flipping his tail in my face.
- Brigham.
Why do you lie to yourself?
You're worried about all this talk of gold... and going to California.
Day and night, that fella Duncan has been at 'em... with his talk about gold.
That all you do is stick a seed in the ground, and it pops up before you can turn around.
You're dead set against
California, aren't you?
You know human nature.
Take a crowd of people to a place of milk and honey... and in six months' time, they won't be worth shooting.
Our only chance is to find someplace... that nobody else has even put foot on.
Sometimes i think i'm being punished... for saying the Lord told me to take charge. i don't think so.
Not after what you've done to hold us together.
[ People Chattering ] if i only knew for sure where we're heading.
You set out to find a place across the Rocky Mountains... where we could live in peace according toJoseph's plan.
That's what the people trusted you to do. i wouldn't disappoint 'em.
Mary Ann, you're as fine a wife as a man ever had.
Sometimes, i don't know what i'd do without you.
Always the same, never complaining.
You're never jealous of the others.
No, Brigham.
Sometimes, i think the Lord has been almost too good to me... just letting me take care of a fine man like you.
That's funny.
When folks have been together as long as we have, it's-- it's kind of hard to say what's in your heart... about lovin' a person. i know.
Remember when i was courtin' you... how we used to sit out just like this on moon-bright nights?
[ Chuckles ]
Mm-hmm. i remember.
Suppose you had to do it all over again?
Would you still have me... knowing all you do about me... and all that you've had to go through?
Yes, Brigham. i'd do it exactly the same.
[ Young ]
Well, Lord, here we are again.
All I keep hearing
is talk of gold in California.
So far I haven't said anything,
that is, the way I feel about it...
figuring that as long
as we're heading west,
they'll be satisfied.
I can't
keep that up forever.
I'm not feeling
very well myself.
I don't seem to be able
to eat or sleep.
And then I'm all cold inside,
kind of shaky.
I must have got hold
of some bad water back yonder.
Maybe it's a touch
of mountain fever...
from eating that
rabbit stew the other night.
You've got to help me
find the right place, Lord...
and find it quick.
Because I can't go on
like this much longer.
[ No Audible Dialogue ] i tell you, Mary Ann, if we lose him, we're done for.
Well, they're leavin'.
They're goin' to California.
- Leavin'?
- it's that white-livered skunk Duncan.
- Didn't you talk to him?
- Talk to him? Sure.
That doesn't do any good.
- They can't leave him like this.
- That Duncan's so shrewd...
he's got people thinking everything
he's doin'is to help Brigham.
Go hitch up the horses and help me get him into the wagon.
- You're not takin' him?
- i am.
He's not able to move.
He'd never forgive me or you either if we let the people go on without him.
- Woman, he'll die.
- He can't stand it. i know the risk i'm takin'.
But if Brigham has to die, it'll be with his people.
You'd want it that way, wouldn't you, Clara? it'll kill him. i'll hitch up the horses.
You get him ready.
Come on.
- Where are we?
- High up in the mountains, Brigham.
What's that strange noise i keep hearing? it's an echo. The wagons sound like a lot of hammers goin'.
Porter set to whistlin' a while back. You'd have thought it was a dozen flutes playin'.
Look out and tell me what you see.
There's nothing but mountains.
Over yonder's one
a mile high.
No, not there.
Look south.
The mountains suddenly fall away?
- Over here they do.
- You can see, maybe... a hundred miles straight off.
Yes, i can.
Pull up.
This is the place.
We'll build our homes down there. it was a revelation.
He knew it before we even got here. it was a revelation.
- [ Whispering ]
- it was a revelation. i thought we were going to California.
So did i.
You said that Brigham Young himself would want to go.
Well, i thought he would.
This isn't the place.
This isn't the place!
Look at it. it's nothing but a lot of desert!
Just a lot of sand and rock!
We'll shrivel up and die like rats.
We're going to California, do you understand?
- We're going to set up our own church.
- Are you?
Yes, we are.
We let you drag us away from Nauvoo.
We left every cent, everything we owned in the world.
We've watched you mark every foot of the way up here... with the bodies of our women and babies, and we haven't said a word.
But when it comes to stopping and settling in a place like that-- the most desolate country we've seen yet-- with California just up ahead waiting for us, it's time to call a halt.
He says God told him this is the place.
But i say it was the devil talking.
And as far as i'm concerned, the devil can keep it!
- We're going on!
- All right, Angus.
That's the way to California. i'm not going to stop you. i wouldn't lift my little finger to hold you... or anybody else that feels the same way.
Moses went up in the hills like this once... and right away the devil started putting in his licks.
Remember how he got the people to build a golden calf and to start worshipping it?
You remember how mad
God and Moses got...
and how close God came
to washing his hands
of the whole business? i don't claim to be a Moses... but i say to you just what he said to the sons of Levi:
''Who is on the Lord's side, let him come unto me.''
Well, you can have your desert. i'm going to California.
[ Angus ] Come on.
You said you were comin', didn't you?
You're goin', aren't you?
Well, are you comin'
or not?
Think of your family
and your children.
What's the matter with you?
You're not gonna build your home
down in that desert, are you?
You'll all starve to death.
Come on. Get up and get goin'.
You said you were comin' with me.
Think of your family!
Our hearts... are mighty humble and mighty thankful.
Lord, we'll make this desert blossom.
There'll be hamlets and cities... vineyards and orchards... with every kind of tree there is.
There'll be no filth in our cities.
There'll be no ugliness of any sort but... broad, clean streets with flowing water.
And the law of the valley
shall be that...
no man may buy or sell land...
for all land
will be held in common.
It'll be measured off
to him, both in the city
and for farming.
And any man may have
as much as he can till...
but he's got to take care
of all he gets.
All wood and timber will
belong to the community, too...
as well as ditches
and canals.
Any person caught
trying to take greedy advantage
of these materials...
will be run
out of the valley.
Now, as to the city itself...
it shall be built in
blocks of ten acres each...
with streets
eight rods wide...
and with gardens and lawns
on both sides.
Right in the middle,
I'm setting aside ten acres
for the temple...
which we'll start building
the day we get our first crop
in the ground.
We're going to establish
Joseph's idea of the United Order...
and build
a mighty empire here...
based on labor and love
and fellowship.
And this time,
doggone it...
I mean to see
that we stick to it.
[ Brass Band ]
- [ Continues ]
- Zina. Come on. We have to hurry!
[ Continues ]
- [ Ends ]
- it's a nice sight to see you people... come up here to put your food in a common storehouse... to be rationed out to everybody alike during the coming winter.
Joseph Smith would be proud of you. it's not just a tithe we're giving this time... although that's the law of the church... but everything we've got. if one eats, we'll all eat.
And if one starves, we'll all starve.
Now, we're gonna have our hands full to make this food last until spring.
So don't waste anything.
Eat regular...
but don't let me
catch any of you people
putting on weight.
Now it's up to us men
to fish and hunt and lay in stores.
And you boys get out
and see how many rabbits
you can lay your hands on.
But don't eat 'em.
Pen 'em up and give 'em
time to multiply...
- like good saints.
- [ Chuckles ]
All right, you fellas in the band, let's hear... ''Come, Come Ye Saints,'' while everybody takes their food over to the storehouse.
And play it good and loud, especially loud.
Leah.
Well, all right, dear. Martha.
John. Harriet.
[ Continues ]
Oh,Jonathan. i'd like for you to go with Porter back to Council Bluffs.
Tell the people there to harvest their crops... but that they must stay there through the winter.
Then they can join us in the spring and bring whatever food's left.
Well, i-- i'll look after them.
- Will you do it?
- Why, yes, sir.
- When can you start?
- i'll be ready to leave by tomorrow morning.
Thank you,Jonathan.
- That all right with you, Porter?
- Fine. See you in the morning.
Good.
How long are you gonna be gone?
Four or five months, i guess.
He has no right to ask you to go.
You've got a family to look after.
Besides, there are plenty of others who can go in your place.
You know how it is here.
Everybody has his job to do.
- This is mine, and i've got to do it.
- Brigham-- Brigham Young.
Don't you care what anybody else thinks or feels?
- He's head of the church.
- Even if he is, he isn't God.
- He can't run everything.
- He'll look after you and the children. i can look after the children, and i'm not worrying about me. it's just that--
Oh. i'm sorry that you had to go and get mad.
- i'm not mad.
- 'Cause if you hadn't been mad... i had it in my mind to tell you about something. i'm not mad!
Well, if you'd been in smilin' good humor, i meant to talk about it.
- Talk about what?
- What i was gonna talk about... if you hadn't got mad.
Maybe you had a revelation.
Well, you might call it that.
We ought to get married right away.
- Right away?
- Well, in the spring... soon as i get back.
Well, i don't see any sense in puttin' it off any longer than that.
Oh, but your Brigham Young'll want you to marry a Mormon girl, won't he?
- Several of them.
- Several? if you're gonna be rich, you'll have to have a lot of wives, won't you? i've been wonderin' how you're gonna go about askin' 'em-- one at a time or all together.
Maybe it would be easier if you said,
''Sisters, will you kindly marry me?''
- Zina!
- Then after you've married
20 or 30 of them... suppose you get to lovin' one more than all the rest put together?
Then there's poorJonathan, loving one and divided by 30.
Now, Zina, you're just talking nonsense.
There they'll be, all darning the same socks and cooking for the same man... and all talking about
their husband.
Just imagine, 30 wives combing your beard!
You haven't answered my question yet about our being married.
Oh, well, it-- it isn't spring yet.
Well, figure it out for yourself.
Say every man's got 20 wives.
- There aren't that many women.
- Oh, we can get 'em.
Women convert easy. And say every wife's got ten children.
That's 200 children apiece.
And say every one of those 200's got 20 wives.
That's 4,000. And say they got ten children apiece.
So that'll give you
40,000 grandchildren.
Figurin' 5,000 men to start with.
Well, that's 200 million.
Quite a settlement. if arithmetic'll do you any good, i'm willin' to call you grandpa now.
Oh, i'm aimin' to do my share.
[ Young ] I don't remember,
Lord, ever seein'a winter
to equal this one.
Started out mild enough,
but now it's hit for sure.
It's just one blizzard
after another.
Snow is so deep that game
has run clean out of the hills.
[ Lowing ]
And even what little cattle
we had left are lost...
or they're frozen to death
where we can't get at 'em.
I've had to cut rations
three times already...
till there's hardly enough
to keep body and soul together.
The babies look mighty hungry
and peaked to me.
The women and the old folks
arejust hangin'on...
livin'on roots or whatever
they could lay their hands to.
Well,just the same,
we're gonna hold out till spring...
when the winter wheat
and the new corn come through.
I don't know how
we're gonna do it...
but we're going to,
Lord, somehow.
[ Crying ]
Mary.
Mary, dear.
- Would you like to play a game with me?
- What kind of a game?
Well, it hasn't any name, but here's the way you play it.
Now first, open up your apron.
Why, that's it.
Now, see the sun in it?
- Yes.
- All right. Now fold your apron back.
Quickly.
Catch the sun.
That's right.
Got it?
All right.
Now bring it over here to me and the baby.
Careful.
Don't drop it.
All right.
Now open your apron and let's see it.
Oh, it's gone. You've lost it.
You had it just a minute ago. i saw you catch it.
Look. There it is. it's still over there on the floor.
Hurry up.
Get it.
Zina, i-- i don't feel like playing. i-- i'm hungry.
[ Weeping ]
Oh, don't, darling.
Don't.
- [ Sniffling, Sobbing ]
- Now, don't cry, sweetie.
[ Mary Crying ]
Jonathan!
Jonathan, i'm hungry.
Hungry?
- Zina, what happened?
- [ Sobbing ]
[ Crying ]
Tablespoon every hour.
Now there's no use playing possum any longer, Miss Zina.
Anybody as pretty as you are can't be very sick.
That girl in there, there's no telling how long it's been... since she's had anything to eat.
- She probably gave everything to the children.
- Yes.
And she isn't the only one who's done that.
- She'll be all right, though, won't she, Doctor?
- i hope so, son.
Now--
Come on now. i'd hate to have to hold your nose and pour.
Zina, Doc Richards said you have to eat something.
Careful. it's hot.
You'll never be hungry again. i promise you that, Zina.
Never again as long as you live.
Open.
There.
You know, all the time i was gone, i kept thinking about... well, how soon it was going to be spring.
One day... it was just about noontime... but i made old Porter stop and camp... right on the spot where our wagon stood that night.
Remember?
You almost promised to marry me... but you fell asleep.
Remember? i asked you again before i went away.
You told me it wasn't spring yet.
Well, it's here now.
Oh, if thinking could've helped to make the time go quicker... spring would've come an awful lot earlier this year. it's no use.
We'll never be able to get married now.
Zina, you couldn't mean that.
[ Sobs ] i tried to believe. i almost did once.
Not anymore. i can't.
There's nothing left to believe in.
- What are you doing?
- Well, the boys are eatin' 'em... and-and the indians eat 'em and--
You kids get in the house.
Go on. Hurry up.
Get!
Jonathan!
Hello,Jonathan. i'm glad to see you.
- What's the matter?
- You promised to take care of Zina.
She's so sick over there, she hasn't even got the strength to eat.
She doesn't care whether she lives or dies. i don't believe God would let that happen.
- God? What's he got to do with it?
-Jonathan! if there is a God, where has he been?
Where is he now?
-Jonathan!
- You said you'd take care of her.
You said a heap of other things, too, but you sayin' 'em didn't make 'em so.
But me, i believed 'em just because it was you sayin' 'em. if you'd told me you was
God Almighty himself... i reckon i'd have believed that too.
But not now, not anymore.
Pa dead. Ma dead.
Everything that i ever loved dead.
Just because you said God wanted it that way.
And now Zina.
We were plannin' to go to California like the others. i told her we would.
We had it all fixed up between us, but no.
You wouldn't let us go.
You said God wanted us to come down here.
He wouldn't let us starve.
And i thought you meant it. i thought God was talkin' to you every step of the way.
God talkin'to you--
Maybe you and him
don't speak the same language. i know you and i don't, not anymore.
Why did you do it?
Why didn't you leave us alone?
Why did you have to take everything that we love-- even God?
Brigham!
Brigham!
Brigham, come on. There's bugs-- crickets-- millions of'em!
- Where?
- Comin' down the mountain.
They're in the wheat already.
- They're eating the wheat.
- Half the fields are covered already.
Crickets in the fields!
Hurry!
[ Pounding ]
Hurry! The crickets are ruining the wheat!
[ Man Shouting ]
Come on! The fields are full of crickets!
What are you gonna do? i don't know.
Go on out to the grain fields.
Listen, people!
Don't waste your time here!
Let's save the grain!
Come on!
Here, you children, get away from there. Let's hope we can find your ma. Come on.
[ Banging ]
- Food?
- Run and get some wood and start a fire.
Mary, you get some clean water in a pot.
Honey, a plague has struck the place.
Crickets are overrunning the fields.
As soon as you get your strength back, we're gonna get out of here.
We're going to California like i promised.
Brigham!
Brigham! Look!
Millions and millions--
the hills are black with 'em.!
They're too much for us, Brigham. it's no use.
Might as well try to push back the ocean with a broom. i told you what would happen if we stopped in this valley... but you wouldn't listen to me!
You ran off with a false prophet!
That's why this happened! it's true.
We're all gonna die!
You brought us out into this place to starve, you--you devil you!
But we've one chance!
Repent and throw him out of here!
- it's true. You ought to be run out of here!
- Yes, you!
[ Angry Shouting ] i wouldn't do that if i was you!
And i'll plug the first one of you that moves!
[ inhales Deeply ] it's true. i lied to 'em, Lord. i told them that you said i was to run things.
But you and i know you didn't.
Do anything you want to me, but-- but save them, especially now when they need you most.
Only your strength is left. i'm licked. i'm all done in.
From now on, it's up to you.
What am i going to do,
Mary Ann? i meant to do so much for them. i've got to tell 'em the truth... even if they kill me for it. i've got to tell 'em.
[ Bell Ringing ]
[ Ringing Continues ]
[ People Murmuring ]
- [ Murmuring Continues ]
- [ Young ] Listen to me, people.
You've a right to know the truth. i told you that the Lord wanted me to run this church. i said he wanted you to build your homes in this valley.
And I promised you in his name
that you wouldn't starve...
that no harm
would come to you.
- i used the Lord's name.
- [ Gulls Squawking ]
[ Man ]
Seagulls!
- [ Squawking Continues ]
- [ Excited Chatter ]
The sky is black with seagulls.
They're headed toward the fields.
Look!
They're eating the crickets!
[ Excited Chatter]
- Oh, our crops are saved!
- Look at them eat!
There are more coming!
Hallelujah.
- What is it?
- Zina, you'll have to see it for yourself.
You see, Brigham?
He was talkin' to you all the time.
Maybe that's the way it is.
Maybe he's ready to say something any way you turn... if you only know how to listen.
Maybe talk-- speech like we use-- maybe that's not his language at all. i know what you're thinking.
Maybe we were both wrong.
There is something to live for.
[ Young ] And someday, good Lord,
we'll build a great city here...
on the shores of Salt Lake.
And when we do,
we'll erect a monument...
to the glory of God...
and to the symbol
ofhis benevolence--
the seagull.
Announcing the departure of
American Airlines westbound flight 9.
Flight 9 now loading at gate three, for immediate departure.
Yes, sir?
- Got anything to Boone City?
Three scheduled daily flights, but there's no space available.
Would you care to make a reservation? - Yes.
Your name, please?
- Derry. D- E- R- R- Y. Fred.
How long will it be? - We can get you on flight 37 on the 19th.
I can't wait that long. I just got back from overseas and I want to get home.
There's a long waiting list.
- I arranged to have my tickets here.
My name is Gibbons. George H.
Gibbons. - They're right here.
Thank you.
- May we weigh your baggage?
Excuse me.
Put them right there, please. - Sorry.
You might try the ATC, Captain.
Where are they? - Out the terminal, and across the field.
Thanks.
You have 16lb excess baggage.
- That's all right. How much is it?
Righto, sir.
At ease, men.
Flight 93.
Flight 93 for Denver,
San Francisco and Seattle.
That flight has been cancelled until further notice.
Yeah?
- You got anything for Detroit?
Nope. How about Cleveland?
- Cleveland?
OK.
- Fill this out.
Guess I'm going to Cleveland.
- lt's a nice town.
Yeah, but Detroit's where I live.
Sarge, what's the chances of a ride to Boone City?
You got orders?
Sure.
- OK.
I haven't got anything now, but fill this out and I'll call you if anything comes up.
OK.
I guess I'll wait.
I need a couple of men to give me a hand with this out to a plane.
OK.
- Let's go.
Let's go, huh?
I bet this thing weighs a ton.
- What's the matter? Tired or something?
OK, let's go.
Out this way.
Fellas, take it easy down the stairs.
Got it?
Take it easy going down the stairs.
- Oh, my aching back.
Derry.
Derry. Captain Fred Derry.
- Coming!
Parrish. Homer Parrish.
- Here!
You Derry?
- Yeah.
Parrish?
- Right.
Got a call from Base Ops. There's a B- 17 taking off for Boone City.
She's making a lot of stops, but you'll get there tomorrow afternoon.
That's swell.
- OK, sign here.
Boy, it sure is great to be going home.
Here you go, sailor.
- Sign on the dotted...
I'll do it for you.
- Think I can't spell my own name?
No, I...
I just thought that...
I know, sarge. Thanks.
You'd better hurry up out there, cos she's taking off soon.
Right, thanks.
Come on, sailor.
Where's your stuff?
Excuse us, Corporal.
Boone City your home, sailor?
- Yes, Captain.
Forget the rank, chum.
I'm out.
Whereabouts do you live in Boone?
- On West 17th Street.
Know where Jackson High is?
- Sure.
It's a couple of blocks past it.
Hiya, sarge.
- How are ya?
My name's Fred Derry.
- Al Stephenson.
And this is Homer...
What is it, Homer? - Parrish.
Glad to know you.
- You from Boone too?
Yeah, sure am.
- How long since you've been home?
A couple of centuries!
Let's sit in the radio compartment for takeoff.
Then we'll get in the nose and get a nice view of the good old USA.
Look at that. Look at those automobiles down there.
You can see them so plain, you can see the people.
Yeah, looks like we're flying by road map.
Is this your first ride in one of these?
- This is my first plane ride.
I saw plenty of flying, all right.
I was on a CV. That's a flattop.
But I never knew things looked so pretty from up here.
Sure is beautiful.
I never thought so.
This used to be my office.
Bombardier, weren't you? - Yeah.
That's where the bombsight was.
I spent a lot of time on my knees up there.
Praying?
- Yeah, that too.
Cigarette, Homer?
- Thanks.
It's all right,
I can get it.
Here, I've got a match, Captain.
Thanks.
- Thank you.
Anybody superstitious?
- No, go ahead.
Well, I am.
Boy, you ought to see me open a bottle of beer.
You got nothing to worry about.
- Thanks.
I guess you saw a lot of action.
- No, I didn't see much of the war.
I mean, the way you fellas did.
- You trying to kid the army?
No, I was stationed in the repair shop, below decks.
Oh, I was in plenty of battles.
But I never saw a Jap or heard a shell coming at me.
When we were sunk, all I know is there was a lot of fire and explosions.
I was ordered topsides and overboard, and I was burned.
When I came to I was on a cruiser, and my hands were off.
After that I had it easy.
- Easy?!
That's what I said.
They took care of me fine.
They trained me to use these things.
I can dial telephones, I can drive a car.
I can even put nickels in a jukebox.
I'm all right.
But...
But what, sailor?
- Well...
Well, you see,
I've got a girl.
She knows what happened to you?
- Sure. They all know.
But they don't know what these things look like.
What's your girl's name, Homer?
- Wilma.
She and I went to high school together.
I'll bet Wilma's a swell girl.
- She is.
And it'll be all right, sailor.
You wait and see.
Yeah.
Wait and see.
Wilma's only a kid. She's never seen anything like these hooks.
Say, wait till I get home and tell the folks about this trip.
I'm the first one in my family that ever rode in an aeroplane.
Hey, Al.
- Yeah?
Remember what it felt like when you went overseas?
As well as I remember my own name.
I feel the same way now.
Only more so.
I know what you mean.
Just nervous out of the service,
I guess.
The thing that scares me most is that everybody's gonna try to rehabilitate me.
All I want's a good job, a mild future, and a house big enough for me and my wife.
Give me that much and
I'm rehabilitated like that.
I'd say that's not too much to ask.
Are you married, Al?
- Yep.
How long?
20 years.
20 years?!
Holy smoke!
We didn't even have 20 days before I went over.
I married a girl I met when
I was in training in Texas.
You and your wife will have a chance to get acquainted.
Yeah.
I wonder how Homer will make out with that girl of his.
Wilma.
I hope Wilma is a swell girl.
The old home town hasn't changed much.
No.
There's the golf course.
People are playing golf.
Just as if nothing had ever happened.
Hey, there's Jackson
High football field.
Boy, I sure would like to have a dollar for every forward pass I threw down there.
Good old Jackson High.
Hey, that must be the new airport.
- Yeah, we're turning into it now.
Holy smoke!
I never knew there were so many planes.
And they're junking them.
- What?
Boy, oh boy.
What we could have done with those in '43.
Yeah, I'll bet.
Some of 'em look brand- new.
From the factory to the scrapheap.
That's all they're good for now.
We gotta get out of the nose while he sets her down.
There's the ballpark.
How are the Beavers doing this season? - They're in sixth place.
Ah!
Still in second division!
Hey, there's Butch's Place.
- Butch's?
Gosh, Butch has got himself a neon sign.
Been to Butch's Place?
Butch Engle that runs it is my uncle.
Swell guy. Only the family don't think he's respectable because he sells liquor.
Best joint in town.
- Let's get together there sometime.
This is my street.
- lt's the fourth house from here.
I wonder if Wilma's home.
How about us going back to Butch's Place?
We'll have a couple of drinks and then we can go home.
You're home now, kid.
Well, so long.
Bye.
- So long, Homer.
Where next?
- Just a minute, bud.
It's Homer! Momma!
Daddy! Homer's here!
Wilma!
Wilma!
Wilma, come on over!
My boy.
- Oh, darling!
It's good to see you.
Isn't this wonderful?
- There's Wilma!
OK, let's go.
Well...
- Don't. I'll carry it.
What's the matter, Ma?
It's... it's nothing.
It's just that your ma's so glad to see you home.
Yeah, I know.
You gotta hand it to the navy. They sure trained that kid how to use those hooks.
They couldn't train him to put his arms around his girl, to stroke her hair.
Is it the next turn up here?
- Yeah, the next turn on the left.
Hey, Fred, why don't we drop you first?
No, you're next.
And we're not going back to Butch's for a drink either.
Feel as if I were going in to hit a beach.
Some barracks you got here.
What are you, a retired bootlegger?
Nothing as dignified as that.
I'm a banker.
How much?
- Take your hand out of your pocket.
You're outranked.
- Yes, sir, Captain, sir.
Good luck, chum.
- Thanks.
Yes, I will.
Yes, sir.
One moment, please.
One moment, please!
Who do you wish to see?
- Mrs Stephenson.
Just a minute.
I'll have to announce you first.
Put that phone down.
I'm her husband.
You're Mr Stephenson?
- Sergeant Stephenson.
What did you expect?
A four- star general?
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
Fourth floor.
- Yes, sir.
I'll get it, Peg.
Where's Mom?
Da...
- Sh.
Who's that at the door, Peggy?
Peggy!
Rob, who was...?
I look terrible.
- Who says so?
It isn't fair of you to bust in on us.
- I phoned you from Portland.
You said you wouldn't be home for...
- We were lucky.
We got a plane to Welburn. I thought we were gonna get stuck there, but we came right through.
Al, are you all right?
- Sure.
Are you all right?
- Course I am.
Let me look at you.
- Don't look now, I need a shave.
If you don't mind, Mom...
Dad... darling.
I'll call the Kenworthys and tell them we won't be over.
The Kenworthys?
- Yes.
My son.
And my daughter.
I don't recognise you.
What's happened?
Just a few years of normal growth.
Don't you approve?
I don't know yet. I've got to have more time to get to know you.
Hello?
Alice, this is Milly. I'm terribly sorry, but we can't be over.
I mean,
I'm terribly happy.
You see, Al...
My husband!
Yes.
He's home.
Yes.
Yes.
Freddy!
- Hortense.
Well, say!
Pat!
Pat, it's Freddy.
He's home again!
Hello, Pop. - I wish we'd known you were coming.
We'd have had the place kinda cleaned up.
Well? Haven't you got anything to say to your own son?
Glad to see you, my boy.
- Look at him, Pat.
Look at your hero son. And look at all those beautiful ribbons on his chest.
Go on, Freddy, tell your father how you got those ribbons and what they mean.
Where's Marie?
- Marie?
Yeah. Is she out?
- Marie isn't here, Freddy.
Will she be back soon?
- She's not living with us.
She took an apartment downtown.
- Why didn't anybody write me about it?
We were afraid it might worry you, you being so far away.
It was inconvenient for Marie, living here, after she took that job.
But we forwarded all your letters and the allotment cheques.
She took a job?
Where?
Uh... some nightclub.
I don't know just which one.
The poor girl works till all hours.
Where does she live? - Uh...
Grandview Arms on Pine Street.
But there's nothing to worry about.
Marie's fine.
We saw her last Christmas. She brought us some beautiful presents.
Marie's a good- hearted girl. - You know what time she goes to work?
Uh... well, about supper time, I imagine.
Do you mind if I leave my stuff here?
I'll pick it up later.
Sure, but aren't you gonna stay and have a bite to eat?
No, thank you, Hortense.
Well, uh... so long, Pop.
I'll be back.
Well, it's...
I'm glad to have you home, my boy.
It's good to be home, Pop. Bye.
Here, a cap.
Here's a samurai sword, Rob.
Thanks very much, Dad.
And here's a flag I found on a dead Jap soldier.
All that writing is good- luck messages from his relatives.
Yes, I know. The Japanese attach a lot of importance to their family relationship.
Yeah.
Yeah, entirely different from us.
You were at Hiroshima, weren't you?
- Mm- hm.
Did you notice any of the effects of radioactivity on the people who survived?
No, I didn't.
Should I have?
We've been having lectures in atomic energy at school.
Mr McLaglen, our physics teacher, he says that we've reached the point where the whole human race has either got to find a way to live together, or else...
Or else.
- That's right. Or else.
When you combine atomic energy with jet propulsion and radar and guided missiles, just think of the...
Oh, you're just kidding me, Dad.
You've been to all these places and you've seen everything.
I've seen nothing.
I should have stayed home and found out what was really going on.
I finished the dishes.
Why do you have to do that?
Is this the maid's night out?
Our maid took a night out three years ago and we haven't seen her since.
But everything's all right because I took a course in Domestic Science.
What's happened to this family? All this atomic energy and scientific efficiency...
It was the war! You heard about that.
- Yeah.
All those problems on the home front.
We used to read about
'em in Stars and Stripes.
We felt awfully sorry for the civilians.
You don't have to worry about us, though.
We can handle the problems. We're tough.
Rob, haven't you any homework?
Oh, sure.
Night, Dad. - I don't see why you have to go now.
Rob, aren't you going to take the souvenirs Father brought you?
Oh, yes.
Thanks an awful lot, Dad, for these... things.
Good night. See you in the morning.
- Night.
Night, Mom.
- Good night, darling.
Nice to have you around, Dad.
You'll get us back to normal.
Or maybe go nuts myself.
What do you think of the children?
The children?
I don't recognise them.
They've grown so old.
I tried to stop them, to keep them just as they were when you left, but they got away from me.
I guess Peggy has a lot of boyfriends.
She's very popular.
Is she concentrating on anyone?
- She hasn't told me of anyone.
But you've, uh... told her all the things she ought to know?
What, for instance?
Well, have you?
She's worked two years in a hospital.
She knows more than you or I ever will.
Want a cigarette?
- Have you forgotten? I don't smoke.
Sorry.
- lt's all right, darling.
Yeah, it's frightening.
What is?
Youth.
Didn't you meet young people in the army?
No, they were all old men, like me.
Yes...
It's terrible to be old, isn't it?
Why don't you sit down and relax?
- I'm perfectly relaxed standing up.
Is there such a thing as a drink in this house?
I'll see.
We haven't got bacon for Dad's breakfast.
I'll go out first thing and try to get some.
Is this all the liquor we have left?
Gosh, I'm afraid so.
I wish he'd given us some warning he was going to get here today.
Don't worry, Mom.
I mean, so that we could have gotten in some supplies of things.
Oh, Mother.
I know it's a little difficult, but... that's only because Dad's so crazy about you, and he's been away so long and missed you so terribly.
He can't just walk in and immediately pick up...
Hey, I got a wonderful idea. Let's go out on the town, the three of us.
Tonight?
- Yes, tonight.
To celebrate the old man's homecoming. - Not me.
No, no, no. You too.
The three of us.
I want to do something, see something.
I've been in jungles and around savages so long,
I gotta find out I'm back in civilisation again.
Be- bop, be- bop
Be- bop a- ree- bop
Rupert, another one in here.
I'll tell you, as I see it, we're headed for bad times in this country.
Of course, we're in the backwash of the war boom, but the tide is running out fast.
Next year, we'll see widespread depression and unemployment.
Oh, have a cigar?
No, thanks.
I've got my pipe.
Homer? Didn't you contract the tobacco habit in the navy?
Just cigarettes,
Mr Cameron. Thanks.
Wilma tells us you were in the Philippines.
I was around there, Mrs Cameron, but I never saw anything.
Did you meet General MacArthur?
- No, I didn't get to meet him.
I've got a light, Mr Cameron.
- No, that's all right.
Got it.
Luella.
- Yes, Dad?
I've always thought he's such a handsome man.
Who?
- General MacArthur.
Oh...
May I help you with that,
Mrs Parrish? - No, you sit right down.
Lemonade, Mrs Cameron?
- Thank you very much.
Thought about getting a job, Homer?
- Well, I...
Father, it's much too soon for
Homer to be thinking about a job.
He's just out of the hospital.
Yes, but a few months from now the same opportunities won't exist that exist today.
You might think about my business
- insurance. We've taken on veterans.
They make good salesmen, men who have suffered some kind of disability.
Come down to the office one of these days, we'll talk it over.
I'm sorry, Mom.
- That's quite all right, Homer.
It won't hurt the carpet a bit.
Luella, go and get me a dishrag.
There's another one for you, Homer.
Wilma will hold it for you.
No, thanks. If you don't mind, I think
I'll go out and walk around a bit.
Where's Homer?
He went out.
It's home, boys, home, home we ought to be
Home, boys, home, back in God's country
Pick- Up Caf?
There it is, driver. Stop here.
Don't you think it's time to go home to bed and get some sleep?
Absolutely. Sleep. But first we've got to stop and have one last little drink.
No arguments.
One drink.
Come on in, driver, and have one with us.
Hey, Homer!
It's good to see you, kid.
Your friend told me you were home, but I didn't expect you...
Hiya, Captain!
Hiya, Homer, my old shipmate! Sit down.
So you took my advice and came to
Butch's? Come on, let's have a drink.
Hello, Homer.
- Hi, Steve!
Am I happy to see you back home again.
Go ahead, shake, pal.
It won't bite you.
What'll you have? - I've dreamed of hearing that question.
Before I went in the navy Butch would never let me drink liquor.
He'd read me lectures on the curse of drink.
But it's different now.
I'm a veteran.
Give me a whiskey, Steve. Straight.
How about it, Butch?
- Draw a beer for the navy.
Butch, I ordered whiskey.
- Beer.
Beer.
I'm gonna take my trade to some other joint where I don't have relatives.
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you home with the folks?
Well, they... they went to bed and I wasn't sleepy, so I thought "Why not come down and see Butch?"
Glad you did, Homer.
Well, here's to you, Butch.
How am I doing?
Kid, you're doing great.
- Thanks.
Where did you leave Al?
Al's home in the swankiest apartment house in town.
We'll never see him again.
Say, this is the best place we've been yet!
Hey, that's Al.
Hey, where you been?
We were just talking about you.
Oh, my aching back.
Hey, Milly. Peggy.
Step up and meet the gang.
This is Homer, this is Fred.
- How do you do?
Homer and I were together at the Battle of Lingayen Gulf, only we didn't know it!
Hiya, bud.
- How do you do?
Al, this is my uncle Butch.
- Bu...?
Oh! I hear you got a new neon sign, huh? Good for you.
Now the party can really get started, eh? - This way, please.
Let's sit. Milly, come on.
- Here's a good booth.
Fred... Sit down. Fred, where's your wife? I want to meet her.
I haven't been able to find her.
She works in some nightclub.
We'll find it, Fred, before this night is out.
We'll deploy our forces and comb the town. Won't we?
By all means.
We got the navy to convoy us.
Huh?
First, Homer lost his hands.
He's got those hooks instead.
They don't worry him, so they don't need to worry anybody else.
Right.
- Now let's get seriously to work.
Telephone. - Thanks.
Give them anything they want.
Any kind of beer.
- What'll it be, folks?
How are you?
- Hiya.
Nice to see you. Looking well.
- Hello.
A little grey...
Well, cheers. Cheers.
- Cheers!
Homer.
Homer.
OK, Butch.
Aren't you drinking?
Excuse me, folks.
- Sure, Homer.
Gee, Butch, it's swell to hear you playing again.
How about "Lazy River"?
Remember that?
Sit down, Homer.
Wilma phoned.
- Wilma?
What did she want?
- You.
Oh, why can't they leave a guy alone?
Because they're fond of you, that's why.
What made you leave the house and get them worried?
Oh, they... they got me nervous.
How? - lt's nothing.
I don't wanna talk about it.
How'd they get you nervous?
Well, they...
They keep staring at these hooks, or else they keep staring away from 'em.
You mean whatever they do is wrong.
Why don't they understand that all I want is to be treated like everybody else?
Take Pop, for instance.
He was cleaning his pipe, like I've seen him do a million times.
All of a sudden he got conscious that he had hands and I didn't, and he... he stopped cleaning his pipe and he tried to hide his hands, like he was guilty or something.
Give 'em time, kid.
They'll catch on.
You know, your folks'll get used to you and you'll get used to them.
Then everything'll settle down nicely.
Unless we have another war.
Then none of us have to worry, because we'll all be blown to bits the first day.
So cheer up, huh?
Hey, Butch.
You know "Among
My Souvenirs", huh?
There's nothing left for me
Shh.
Shall we dance?
- That's a charming idea.
Do you remember this tune?
Nice to see the young folks enjoying themselves, isn't it?
So you're Al's daughter.
Yes. I've been that as long as I can remember.
You don't seem like Al's daughter.
Actually, I'm not.
He's my son by a previous marriage.
What did you say your name was?
- Peggy.
Peggy. My name's Fred.
How do you do?
How do you do?
No, you... Oh, no.
You're a bewitching little creature.
In a way, you remind me of my wife.
- But you never told me you're married.
Oh, yeah. I've got a little woman and two kiddies back there in the States.
But let's not think of them now.
- Oh, you're so right.
This night belongs only to us.
That's the type of thing people ought to be thinking about.
All right,
I promise I'll get right to work on it.
And there's one thing I've been wanting to ask you.
You ask it, Peggy.
You mustn't feel shy with me.
Why don't you call your wife?
I don't know her number.
I couldn't find it in the phone book.
Phone book?! We don't need to do any telephoning.
We're all set.
What you need is a drink.
Good night, everybody.
I'm going home. - Why?
I've got to. Butch is gonna drive me.
- Oh, no, no.
No, you can't...
- lt's quite all right.
Don't leave. I'll be right back.
- Good night.
Good night.
- Poor kid. He's got to go home.
Doesn't that put any ideas in your head?
Yes.
I'd love to.
Lights out, Steve.
Oh!
Ho- ho- ho!
Where do we go next, old pal, old pal?
Just follow me, old pal.
Step.
Good night, Al.
- Good night. Nice party.
This it, Fred?
It looks like it.
Ooh, silly.
Good night, Milly. Many thanks for a most enjoyable evening.
Good night, Fred.
- Good night, Al.
Best of luck to you.
I'll give him your message.
- You do that.
And good night to you,
Peggy. It has indeed been a pleasure.
Yes, Fred. See you soon.
- By all means.
Ooh!
I beg your pardon.
Good night.
We'd better wait and see if he gets in.
I don't think he even knows if this is the right place.
Come on.
Up...
Where are we all going now? - Don't ask. We want it to be a surprise.
They make a lovely couple, don't they? - Yeah.
I think they'll be very happy together.
Who are you?
- Don't you remember? I'm Peggy.
Oh, yes.
Peggy.
I'm not that Peggy.
That's too bad.
As I remember, when you lie flat on your back you snore.
Where's your hand?
Give me your hand.
..my souvenirs
..my souvenirs
..my souvenirs
Is Fred all right?
- Yes. He's all right.
You'll be comfortable here.
- Sure, Mom. Night.
Night, dear.
Night.
- Night.
Bandits at four o'clock.
It's all right, buddy.
You got him.
He's hit.
She's on fire.
She's on fire!
The fire's spreading.
It's Gadorsky.
There goes number four.
She's breaking formation.
Watch out for fighters.
It's spread to the wing.
The wing's on fire!
She's out of control.
She's out of control!
She's going down!
Hey, you guys, jump!
Get outta there!
Bail out!
Gadorsky!
Gadorsky, get out of that plane!
Two chutes open.
Three.
The rest of you guys...
- Fred.
..get out!
- Fred, wake up!
Gadorsky! Gadorsky!
- Wake up!
She's burning up! Get out! Get out!
- Fred! Fred, wake up!
She's burning up!
She's gonna hit. Look out!
It's all right, Fred.
Go back to sleep.
Go back to sleep.
Go back to sleep, Fred.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
All you have to do is... go to sleep and rest.
Go to sleep.
Go to sleep, Fred.
Go to sleep and rest.
Go to sleep, Fred.
Go to sleep.
All you have to do is rest.
Go to sleep.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry I woke you up.
Oh, that's all right.
But...
I know.
You're about to say "Where am I?"
I'll tell you later, Fred.
You can sleep as long as you want.
Did he fly 17 s or 24s?
I don't know.
What group was he with?
- He didn't say.
Well, what did you two talk about?
Rob, you'd better hurry up.
You'll be late for school.
Holy Moses!
I'll see you later.
Bye.
Oh, excuse me, Captain.
I'm Rob Stephenson, Peggy's brother.
She's in there in the kitchen, fixing your breakfast.
I've gotta run.
Goodbye.
Hello.
- Hello.
Sit down.
Here, this may help.
- Thanks.
Sit down.
You're Peggy, aren't you?
For the last time, yes.
Want some eggs?
- You think I can take 'em?
Sure, they'll be good for you.
Like 'em scrambled?
- Any way you cook 'em.
Good.
Sleep all right?
Wonderful.
That's good.
Can I help you with any of that business?
You can pour the coffee if you want some.
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
No.
Where did you sleep last night?
On the couch.
That's terrible.
- What's terrible?
I should have had enough sense to go to a hotel and not come here, bothering you.
You didn't bother anybody, Fred.
We're very glad to have you here.
Besides, you couldn't have gotten a room in a hotel.
Did I get out of line with you?
No.
Not really.
That's good.
Cos, you see, I'm married.
Yes, I know.
I must have got pretty plastered last night.
You had nothing on my dad.
Your dad?
Who's he?
Don't you remember Al?
Oh, Al.
Yeah, good old Al.
Where is he?
- Still asleep, I guess.
So you're Al's daughter.
You've got it all straight now.
I feel a lot better.
- That's good.
Are you married, Peggy?
- No.
You've hardly had time. You must have been engaged, though.
No.
Why not? What's the matter with the guys around here?
I guess the best of 'em are already married.
Good morning, Fred.
- Good morning, Mrs, uh...
Milly's the name.
- Thanks, Milly.
When Al wakes up, tell him how much I...
You're not going? You haven't even finished your breakfast.
I haven't got much of an appetite.
Besides, I've got to get downtown.
Maybe now I can get into where my wife lives.
I'll drive you, Fred. I've got to get to work at the hospital. I'll just be a minute.
I must've acted disgracefully last night. - No.
You just fell in with bad company at Butch's and got stinking.
You see, the whole trouble was,
I couldn't find Marie - that's my wife.
I didn't know she had a job in a nightclub.
Could happen to anyone. If Al had come home later, we wouldn't have been in.
He wouldn't have known where we were. - How is Al?
We don't know yet.
- Ready, Fred.
Well, when he wakes up you can tell him I think he's a pretty lucky guy.
Thank you, Fred. - Goodbye.
Thanks a lot for everything.
Goodbye.
Bye, Mom.
- Bye, dear.
Among my souvenirs
Among my...
What'd you do before the war, Fred?
- I was a fountain attendant.
A what?
- Soda jerk.
Oh.
- Surprised?
Yes, a little.
I'll bet you mixed up a fine ice- cream soda.
You're darn right.
I was an expert behind that fountain.
I'd toss a scoop of ice cream in the air, adjust for velocity, altitude, and - wham!
- in the cone every time.
I figure that's where I really learned to drop bombs.
What do you think you'll do now?
I'm not going back to that drugstore.
Somehow or other, I can't figure myself getting excited about a root- beer float.
I don't know just what I will do, but I'm gonna take plenty of time looking around.
I guess after all the places you've been,
Boone City looks pretty dreary to you.
Not from where I'm sitting right now.
That's not just a line.
I really meant it.
Who's that?
- lt's me, Milly.
I brought your breakfast.
- Oh! Thanks.
Didn't think you'd be up for hours. - I had a dream. I dreamt I was home.
I've had that same dream hundreds of times before.
This time I wanted to find out if it's really true.
Am I really home?
- Looks like it.
And you're going to be royally treated.
You're having breakfast in bed.
I seem to have a vague recollection that we had a couple of children. Is that right?
That's right.
- Whatever became of them?
Rob's gone to school and Peggy's driving downtown with Fred.
Fred?
Oh.
Oh, yeah, Fred.
He's a great guy.
All right?
There's your breakfast.
I have work to do.
Well, it was nice knowing you, Peggy.
That sounds like a permanent goodbye.
You never know.
You and your wife must come up to dinner.
That'd be fine.
Oh, there's one thing more.
About that dream I had last night.
I've had it before.
I'm sorry I bothered you with it.
- I...
But you were very kind, and you didn't even mention it this morning.
As a matter of fact, you've been swell about everything.
They ought to put you in mass production.
Goodbye, Fred.
- Bye.
Maybe I'd better wait and see if you get in.
Maybe that's a good idea.
Bye.
All right!
All right!
Say, what's the big i...?
Freddy!
- Hiya, babe.
Freddy, darling, why didn't you let me know?
You didn't give me time to fix my face. - You look all right.
Oh, Freddy, darling, I'm so excited!
I can't believe it's you!
Come on in, honey, where I can look at you.
Oh, you're marvellous!
All those ribbons! You gotta tell me what they all mean.
But not now.
Let me look at you.
But how did you know I was here?
I got in yesterday, went to Pop's house... - Yesterday?! Why didn't...?
I came here, but you'd gone to work.
I went from one nightclub to another.
You were looking for me?
- For my wife.
Well, you've found her now.
I wonder how Fred's getting along.
Fred's able to take care of himself.
I'm not so sure. It isn't easy for air force glamour boys when they get grounded.
When you've been in the infantry, any change is bound to be an improvement.
Stop fussing around and sit down and talk to me.
All right, Sergeant.
Gosh, you've got tough.
Is this all the cream?
- That's all.
Fine situation when a man can't get enough to eat in his own home.
Look at my pants.
- What about them?
Too big! Gives you an idea of what the war did to my waistline.
You holding your stomach in?
- No, it's disappeared.
I'll have to take all my old clothes to be altered.
I wouldn't be in too much of a hurry.
A couple of weeks of heavy eating and those pants will fit perfectly.
Don't answer it.
Hello?
Oh, yes.
He's here.
For me?
If it's the War Department, I'm out.
It's Mr Milton.
- Who?
Mr Milton at the bank.
- Oh.
He'll be right on.
Hello?
Oh, yes,
Mr Milton.
Yeah, it sounds good to hear yours.
Yes.
Yes, indeed,
Mr Milton. Yeah...
Well, not too bad, no.
Yes.
Why, of course.
It's very kind of you to say that.
Mm- hm.
Mm- hm.
Yes.
Well, I'll...
I'll certainly drop in.
Oh, she's fine, thank you.
Yes, they're fine too.
Well...
I...
That's...
Thank you,
Mr Milton.
Yes, good...
Good...
Good... goodbye.
Mr Milton.
He calls every day to see if you're home.
I guess they want you back at the bank.
He wants me to drop in and talk about it.
- You're not going to work right away?
You ought to rest awhile, take a vacation.
I've got to make money.
Last year it was kill Japs, and this year it's make money.
We're all right for the time being.
- Mm.
Why do they have to bother me the first day I get home?
Why not give me time to get used to my family? Come over here and sit down.
Chair's liable to break.
- We can't be worrying about chairs.
Not when they want me back in a nice fat job in a nice fat bank!
You don't seem very happy about it.
- I'm not.
Why not, darling? - I keep thinking about the other guys.
All the ones who haven't got you.
You're crazy.
- No, too sane for my own good.
Yes, sir?
- Wasn't this Bullard's Drugstore?
Yes, but it was taken over by the Midway chain.
Oh.
- But old Mr Bullard's still here.
He's right over there by the phone.
- Thanks.
Yes, sir?
Oh, Fred!
- Hello, Mr Bullard.
It's good to see you again.
- lt's good to see you.
Say, what happened here?
- Well, I sold out.
Midway had been after this location for a long time.
Didn't he used to work here?
- Yes, he did.
I'll bet he's back looking for a job.
And he'll get it, too, with all those ribbons on his chest.
Well, nobody's job is safe with all these servicemen crowding in.
Meet our new manager, Mr Thorpe.
- Oh, no, I don't think so.
I just dropped in to say hello to you.
I don't want that old job back.
Yes, I know.
But Midway's a big, big outfit.
You never can tell.
Come along.
Thank you, Mr Bullard.
- I'll see you later.
I see you had a splendid war record.
- Just average, Mr Thorpe.
Since this business changed hands, we're not obliged to give you your old job back.
I wasn't thinking of my old job.
I'm looking for a better one.
What are your qualifications?
Your experience?
Two years behind a soda fountain, three years behind a Norden bombsight.
Yeah. While in the army, did you have any experience in procurement?
No.
- Purchasing of supplies, materials?
No, I just dropped bombs.
Did you do any personnel work?
- No.
But as an officer you surely had to act in an executive capacity, you had to command men, be responsible for the morale?
I was only responsible for getting the bombs on the target.
I didn't command anybody.
- I'm sure that required great skill.
But, unfortunately, we've no opportunities for that with Midway Drugs.
Yeah.
We may be able to provide an opening as assistant to Mr Merkel, the floor manager.
"Sticky" Merkel?
- Clarence Merkel.
That's the fella. He was my assistant at the soda fountain.
He's a very good man.
Incidentally, your work would require part- time duties at the soda fountain.
At what salary?
- 32.50 per week.
32.50! I used to make over
$400 a month in the air force.
The war is over, Derry.
I think I'll look around, Mr Thorpe.
Thank you, very much.
And take care of that cold.
I gotta run. I'll drop back later.
- All right, Fred. Bye.
Excuse me, girls.
No, conditions are none too good right now, Al.
Considerable uncertainty in business.
Strikes.
Taxes still ruinous.
You like that cigar?
- Yes, Mr Milton. It's fine.
Hard to get those in the war, but they come in regularly from Havana now.
Things will readjust themselves in time.
We want you back here with us, Al.
That's very nice of you, Mr Milton, but I noticed Steese sitting at my old desk.
I wouldn't want to push him out.
- Steese'll stay right there.
You're moving up.
What do you say to being vice president in charge of small loans, at $12,000 a year?
What do you say to that, huh?
I... I'd say it can't be true.
Job's there, Al.
You're the man for it. - What makes you think I am, Mr Milton?
Well, your war experience would prove invaluable to us here.
See, we have many new problems.
This Gl Bill of Rights, for instance.
It involves us in consideration of all kinds of loans to ex- servicemen.
We need a man who understands the soldiers' problems, and who's well grounded in the fundamental principles of sound banking.
In other words, you.
Well?
What do you say, Al?
Well, I'm...
I'm overwhelmed.
Of course.
Of course.
Will you bring them in now, please?
- Yes, sir.
I'd thought of taking it easy...
- Naturally.
After what you've been through, you need a vacation. Thank you.
You're entitled to enjoy life before you come back to work.
It's very kind of you to say that.
- When you get a chance...
This contains reports with all the figures on our Small Loans Department.
Just in your spare time, of course.
Oh, the briefcase is a slight gift from the bank.
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much, Mr Milton.
Glad to have you back with us, Al.
- Thank you, sir.
Sweetheart, I knew you'd be heartbroken.
But listen, you can get another blonde. What about Sylvia Mack?
Oh, you're crazy.
I think her legs are cute.
I'm sorry too, but he doesn't want me to work nights.
He says it's inconvenient.
Oh, he's wonderful.
And how!
Snappy uniform, a whole ribbon counter on his chest.
Sure, I'll bring him in sometime.
Hey, the door bell's ringing.
I guess that's my Freddy.
Bye.
Hey, Marie, have you got an extra key? I'd like to have it.
What are you looking at?
- Holy smoke, honey!
That's the first time I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.
Well, from now on, honey, you're not gonna see me in anything else.
I just got it out of the mothballs over at Pop's house.
I called up the Blue Devil.
Who? - The nightclub.
I told 'em I'm through.
Oh, swell.
- But let's go there for dinner.
I'd like to introduce you.
They've heard all about you.
Anything you say, honey. Here's some perfume I bought in Paris.
Oh!
Fleurette No. 5!
And this scarf's cute!
To think of having things from Paris!
Freddy, honey, you're just a big hunk of heaven. What's that a picture of?
Bomb hits on D黶seldorf.
That's my B- 17.
What are those?
Little black flowers that grow in the sky. - Huh?
Hey, that's me! - I had it pasted above my bombsight.
It took a lot of trips over Germany.
- That's sweet.
The guys'd kid me about it. They'd take a look at it and ask "Who's the dame?"
When I told 'em it was my wife they'd say "Nobody's got a wife looks like that."
"What's her telephone number?"
When we go out will you wear your uniform?
Oh, no.
- For my sake.
I'm sorry, baby.
- I'd be so proud to be out with you.
Won't you, please?
Well, seeing as it's you and seeing as I can't find any place to hang it, all right.
But it's the last time.
If you don't like me in civilian clothes, we'll just have to stay here all the time.
Would that be so bad?
You gotta get yourself some new clothes. That suit's awful.
I know, it's terrible. But they tell me you can't buy anything new now.
I know where you can get snappy suits made to order.
You mean there's a black market?
- lf you know the right people, and don't care how much you spend...
We're not worrying about that, baby.
I got money, cash money.
Nearly 1 ,000 bucks, from the good old US Treasury.
Oh, now you look wonderful!
You look like yourself.
It's so wonderful,
I can hardly believe it.
Now we can have a real honeymoon, without a care in the world.
Just as if nothing had ever happened.
Just as if you'd never gone away.
We're right back where we started.
Don't say that, Marie.
- Don't say what?
That we're right back where we started.
We never wanna be back there.
But why not? What is it?
What's the matter?
Oh, never mind. Skip it. I went back to the drugstore today and I just got reminded.
Come on, let's go out and have fun.
Hello, Wilma.
- Good afternoon, Mr Parrish.
Have you seen Homer?
- He's in the woodshed.
He wants to practise shooting.
So he can go hunting.
You'd have thought he'd seen enough shooting in the war.
I guess he just wants to find something to occupy himself.
I guess so.
I wish there was something
I knew to do for him.
His mother and I have tried to make him feel at home, but he just keeps to himself all the time.
Hello, Luella.
What are you kids doing?
Nothing.
We're just playing.
That's his girl.
They're engaged.
Oh. Hello, Wilma.
- Hello.
Looking for something?
- No. Go right ahead.
How'd you do, Homer?
- Only fair.
Well, you did fine.
I'll do better.
I've been wanting to talk to you.
What about?
- About everything. About us.
What about us?
We're all right, aren't we?
No.
Listen to me, Homer.
I'm listening.
You wrote me that when you got home you and I were going to be married.
If you wrote that once, you wrote it 100 times. Isn't that true?
Yes, but things are different now.
Have you changed your mind?
Have I said anything about changing my mind?
No.
That's just it. You haven't said anything about anything.
That's not loaded, is it?
- Of course it isn't.
Don't you think I know how to handle a gun?
I don't know what to think, Homer.
All I know is, I was in love with you when you left and I'm in love with you now.
Other things may have changed, but that hasn't.
You wanna see how the hooks work?
You wanna see the freak?
All right,
I'll show you!
Take a good look!
I didn't mean anything, Homer.
I was only...
I'm... I'm sorry, Luella.
It isn't your fault.
Go on and play with your friends.
I know, Wilma.
I was wrong.
I shouldn't have acted like that.
It wasn't her that... burned my hands off.
I'll be all right.
I just gotta work it out myself.
I could help you, Homer, if you'd let me. - I've gotta work it out myself.
All I've wanted is for people to treat me like anybody else, instead of pitying me.
I guess it's hard for them to do that.
I've just gotta learn to get used to it and pay no attention.
Couldn't I...?
- No! I've gotta do it myself.
Yes?
- OK, Pop, I'm going to bed now.
Be right with you, Homer.
Night, son.
- Good night, Pop.
Thanks.
Hello, babe.
- What you got there?
Our supper. Cream of corn soup, potato salad, salami and liverwurst.
We're going to Jackie's Hot Spot.
I made a reservation.
We're eating at home.
- Are you sick or something?
No, dear.
Broke.
Broke?
- You got it.
Well, what happened?
Where did it go to?
We spent it, babe.
That's what happened.
I didn't tell you the money was almost gone because I kept hoping I was gonna land a good job.
But I'm not going to get one, so we'll have to forget about Jackie's Hot
Spot and the Blue Devil and all the rest.
Why couldn't you get a job?
Have you tried?
Sure. I've been all over town - all the employment offices and the USES.
They say I ought to spend a couple of years as an apprentice, or go to a trade school.
A couple of years, with you going to kindergarten.
And what would I be doing in the meantime?
You can always help me with my homework.
Fred.
- Yeah?
Are you really all right?
- Of course I'm all right. Why?
I mean, in your mind.
Is anything...?
My mind?!
You mean you think I'm going goofy?
I've been wondering.
What was Gadowsky?
Where did you hear about him?
- You talk in your sleep.
Something's on fire and you want somebody to get out.
You keep saying "Gadowsky!
Gadowsky!"
Gadorsky.
He was a friend of mine, a B- 17 pilot. He got it over Berlin.
Can't you get it out of your system?
- Oh, sure
The war's over. You won't get anyplace till you stop thinking about it.
Come on, snap out of it!
- OK, honey, I'll do that
I didn't tell you, Fred, but I got a little money saved.
Dinner's on me tonight.
You'd better keep on saving it.
It might come in handy sometime.
I appreciate the offer, but we're eating at home.
Well, I'm hungry.
I'm going out by myself.
You're not going.
You'll eat what I cook. - Let go of me!
When we married, the justice of the peace said "For better, for worse". Remember?
This is the "worse".
- When do we get the "better"?
When I get wise to myself,
I guess.
When I realise I'm not an officer and a gentleman any more,
I'm just another soda jerk out of a job.
Go and sit down and read a magazine or listen to the radio while I cook the soup.
I'll fix you a nice meal, honey.
Just like I used to do behind the fountain, before the war.
Perfume and Cosmetics is our outstanding feature.
It accounts for 34? of gross intake and an even higher proportion of profits.
As you will surmise, our customers in this department are women.
Yes, I'd surmised that.
You must familiarise yourself with the correct pronunciation of all the perfumes.
R陃e Romantique.
- That means Romantic Dream.
You speak French? - Sticky, just enough to go to Paris bars.
Let's get one thing straight, Derry.
The name "Sticky" is out.
Yes, Mr Merkel.
I understand.
This week we're pushing the new
Champagne Bubble Bath. $1 .98.
Down here are some special...
Come here.
Down here are some specially made- up toilet sets...
Thank you.
- Morning, Mr Latham.
Morning.
- Good morning, Mr Stephenson.
What have we here?
The Bretton Woods Agreement?
That's a Mr Novak, waiting over there. He's applying for a Gl loan.
Oh, good. I'll see him.
- Mr Novak.
Sit down, Mr Novak.
- Thank you, sir.
Don't "sir" me,
Mr Novak.
I'm a sergeant.
I see you were in the navy.
- Yes, sir.
I mean, yes, I was.
In the Seabees.
Where'd you operate?
All over the Pacific.
One island after another.
What'd you do, mostly?
Go in before the landings and clear the mines and underwater obstructions.
When they'd taken enough ground for an airstrip we'd build it.
Fairly interesting work, eh?
- No, it got monotonous.
Those islands all look alike.
Until Iwo Jima. That was different.
So I've heard.
I see you have quite a family.
A wife and four children.
Yes. There'd have been more if
I hadn't been away three years.
And now you wanna buy a farm.
- Yes, sir.
Got my eye on a fine piece of property.
40 acres, out near Anton Corners.
What about collateral?
Collateral? What's that?
- Security for your loan.
What can you put up in the way of property?
Have you any stocks and bonds?
Real estate? Valuables of any kind?
No, Mr Stephenson. You see, the point is, I haven't got any property.
That's why I want the loan, so I can get the property.
I see.
No collateral.
That makes things difficult.
I'm a good farmer,
Mr Stephenson.
Why, even during the war I kept my hand in.
I used to spend my spare time down on those islands working truck gardens so my outfit could have fresh tomatoes and green corn and all that.
And before the war I was a sharecropper, like my father before me.
And now, I feel I'd like to have a little piece of my own to work.
You like to grow things, eh?
- Yes, sir.
And with the food shortage all over the world, farming's about the most important work there is.
I mean... Well, don't you think so,
Mr Stephenson?
Yes.
You see, Mr Stephenson, I don't feel this is asking the bank for a handout.
I feel it's my right. At least, that's what
I've been told by other ex- servicemen: that the government guarantees loans to us...
Your loan would be administered through this bank, which would put up half of the $6,000 you require.
Now, that involves risk for this bank,
Mr Novak.
Excuse me.
Al!
- Homer!
Look at you!
- Look at you!
So this is where you work. - Sort of.
Are you sticking up the bank?
Look, 200 leaves of cabbage. That's what I get every month from now on.
Pretty soft, eh?
- Pretty soft.
You sure we haven't short- changed you?
- I kept my eye on the guy counting it out.
Did you know Fred Derry had a job at the Midway Drugstore?
No, I didn't.
- He introduced me to his wife.
Yeah?
- Some dish.
We'll all have to get together at Butch's.
Fine. That's where I'm going now.
- Yeah?
To take a piano lesson.
- You... Uh- huh?
Take one for me.
See you later.
- So long, Homer.
Well, as I was saying, Mr Novak, there is an element of risk involved.
We'll have to have the property appraised. But you'll get your loan.
Say, Mr Stephenson, I don't know how to begin to thank you.
Don't try.
You look like a good risk to me.
When the tomato plants start producing, I want free samples.
I'll tell you when the papers are ready. - Thank you, sir. Thank you.
God bless you.
I've seen advertisements about this.
Night of Bliss.
Is it all that they say it is?
What do they say it is?
"Haunting, provocative, languorous."
Oh, yes,
I'm sure it's all of those.
Dexter!
Don't play with those toys, bud.
- My name ain't Bud!
Dexter, stop that.
- I just wanted to see how it worked.
Sorry.
You heard what Mommy said.
Ooh, Seduction.
How much is that?
This is... It's quite expensive.
It's 16.50. But it's a nice size.
You see what I mean?
But it's a good, safe bet.
- Just what do you mean by that?
Well, I mean it's... it's a perfume that fits any mood.
Oh!
All right, I'll take it.
- Very good, madam.
Mommy! Mommy, look!
Bang, bang, bang, bang!
I shot it down!
I shot it down in flames!
I'm very sorry... Oh, hello.
Hello.
Thank you very much. I'll be with you in just a moment, madam.
Will you take this, please?
This lady will have your package in a moment.
Thank you very much.
Come in again. - Thank you.
You were wonderful.
- I wanted to smack him.
It's against the rules to chat, unless it's a sale.
Oh. All right,
I'll buy something.
What's this? - Youth Recaptured, a complexion cream.
But you don't need any of that phoney stuff.
That's vanishing cream.
This is a vanishing- cream remover.
I'll tell you how you can save money.
If you don't put that on, you don't need this.
How about some lotion?
Here's one at $2.98.
And you'd be overcharged at half the price.
I didn't really come in to buy anything.
Dad told me you were working here.
I just dropped in to say hello.
Just a minute.
I have...
I have an hour off at one o'clock.
Are you doing anything for lunch?
Why, no.
- Thank you, madam.
I'll meet you outside in 20 minutes.
Come in again.
Thank you.
The apple pie, she's homemade.
- Good.
Thank you.
It is a nice little place.
I never heard of it before.
I used to come here now and then in the old days, before the war.
I used to think of this place when I was overseas.
I thought "When I get back home I'm never gonna eat in a dump like Lucia's."
What else did you think you wouldn't do?
I never had any clear ideas, but there were two things I was sure of.
One, that I knew I'd never go back to that drugstore.
What was the other thing?
That was even sillier.
I dreamed I was gonna have my own home.
Just a nice little house for my wife and me out in the country...
In the suburbs, anyway.
That's the cockeyed kind of dream you have when you're overseas.
You don't have to be overseas to have dreams like that.
Yeah. You can get crazy ideas right here at home.
You have to be back at work at two?
- Yeah.
Well, hadn't you better...?
Yeah. Check, please. - 85c apiece for lunch, plus tax, is $1 .76.
OK.
Thank you very much. Goodbye.
- Bye.
Goodbye, signorina. Come again.
- We'll do that. So long.
Arrivederci.
Well...
That shouldn't have happened.
But I guess it had to.
Goodbye, Peggy.
- Goodbye.
We were discussing this loan to this man... What's his name?
Novak.
Yes.
Yes, I approved it.
May I ask, Al, on what basis?
On the basis of my own judgment.
Novak looked to me like a good bet.
But the man has no collateral, no security.
Evidently, you saw something in him. - Yes, Mr Milton.
What was it?
- Security.
Collateral.
In the army I was with men stripped of everything in the way of property except what they carried around with them and inside them.
I saw them being tested. Some of them stood up to it, some didn't.
But you could tell which ones you could count on.
I tell you, this man Novak is OK.
His "collateral" is in his hands, in his heart, in his guts. In his right as a citizen.
Nobody's denying him his rights.
- We are. If we deny him his chance...
Gentlemen, there's no need to raise our voices.
Of course, since you've approved the loan, the incident is closed.
However, in the future, Al...
- Yes, I understand, Mr Milton.
In the future I must exercise more caution.
Thank you,
Mr Prew.
Al, uh...
Al, you know how I feel about you and always have.
Why, I've always considered you one of the family, so to speak.
Like my own s... younger brother.
I picked you personally for this job, and I know you'll make good.
We do have a desire to extend a helping hand to returning veterans when possible.
But we must all remember that this is not our money we're doling out.
It belongs to our depositors, and we can't gamble with it.
I'll remember,
Mr Milton.
We'll meet at the Union Club at 7.30.
And give my best to your charming wife. - Thank you, Mr Milton.
Hello.
- Oh, hello.
Hurry and get dressed.
And wear your new suit.
We're going to dinner at the Embassy Club.
Don't worry, it won't cost a nickel.
We got invited.
Who invited us?
- Miss Peggy Stephenson.
She called up, said her father was a friend of yours. She sounded like a nice kid.
She's going out with some boyfriend and asked us on a double date, as guests.
You told her we could go?
- You bet I did.
Well, call her up and tell her we can't go.
Tell her I made another engagement.
Say, who is this Peggy Stephenson?
- She's a girl.
I didn't think she was a kangaroo.
Where'd you meet her?
The night I got back, Al Stephenson and his wife took me home.
She's their daughter.
I'd never seen her before.
Or since?
If you wanna make anything out of this, you'll be disappointed.
I just don't like accepting handouts.
You'd better get used to it, cos we won't get much fun on your 32.50 a week!
Hold still!
You'll probably have to make a speech.
It's my plan to meet that situation by getting well plastered.
Peggy's going out with
Woody Merrill. - Who's he?
You know, Bill Merrill's son.
- Oh, yeah.
Fine people, the Merrills.
Strictly TCR.
What's that?
- Top credit rating.
Are his intentions honourable?
- I doubt it.
But they're going to be chaperoned by Fred Derry and his wife.
Fred Derry? Ha!
Some chaperone!
I think she's crazy about him.
- Who, Merrill?
No, Fred.
Have you got evidence to support that amazing statement?
Just a hunch.
- Oh.
But my hunches are pretty good.
Ah! Cocktails!
- No, you don't.
I made this for Woody Merrill.
Surely you wouldn't deny your father a drop on a cold night like this.
I would if I could.
- I hear you're gonna see Fred, hm?
Yes.
- What's his wife like?
I don't know.
I'll tell you later.
They'll have cocktails at the Union Club.
I know the kind Mrs Milton serves: pink, sweet and nauseating.
I was just asking Peggy about Fred's wife.
Never mind, Mom.
I know what you're both thinking.
What are we thinking?
You're afraid I may be in love with Fred.
Why, I never had any such idea!
- Shut up, Al.
Are you in love with him?
Yes.
But I don't want to be.
That's why I asked him and his wife to go out with us this evening.
I think it ought to have a very healthy effect on me.
Once I get to know her, I...
I'm sure I'll stop being silly about the whole thing.
We don't need to worry about that child. She can take care of herself.
That's what she thinks.
Good evening.
- Good evening.
You know my father.
- Mr Stephenson.
Nice to see you again. Have a drink?
- Thank you.
I've played golf with your father.
Been to the club since you got back?
- I haven't had a chance.
Al, we'll be late.
- Right.
Good night.
- Night.
Have a good time, children.
- Thank you.
Give my best to Fred.
Al, come on!
Yes, Mr Milton!
Hello, Peggy.
- Oh, Woody, don't be a bore.
We'll be late.
Our country must stand today where it has always stood, the citadel of individual initiative, the land of unlimited opportunity for all.
It is peculiarly appropriate that we meet here tonight to honour one who has valiantly fought for that freedom.
Ladies and gentlemen, we greet our friend, our co- worker, our hero,
Al Stephenson.
Come on, on your feet,
Al. On your feet.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm very happy to be here.
In fact,
I'm very happy to be anywhere.
In fact,
I'm very happy!
Perhaps it'd be a good idea if you just put that bottle down right here.
Save yourself quite a number of trips. - Good old Al!
I'm glad to see you've all pulled through so well.
As Mr Milton so perfectly expressed it, our country stands today... where it stands today. Wherever that is.
I'm sure you'd all agree with me if I said that now's the time to stop this nonsense, face facts, get down to brass tacks, forget about the war, and go fishing.
But I'm not gonna say it.
I'm just going to sum the whole thing up in one word.
My wife doesn't think I'd better sum it up in that one word.
The reason for my success as a sergeant is due primarily to my previous training in the Cornbelt Loan and Trust Company.
The knowledge I acquired in the good old bank
I applied to my problems in the infantry.
For instance, one day in Okinawa, a major says "You see that hill?"
I said "Yes, sir. I see it."
"All right," he said.
"You and your platoon will attack said hill and take it."
So I said "But that operation involves considerable risk."
"We haven't sufficient collateral."
"I'm aware of that", said the major, "but you are the guys who are going to take it."
So I said to him "I'm sorry, Major.
No collateral, no hill."
So we didn't take the hill, and we lost the war.
Uh, I think that little story has considerable significance.
But I've...
I've forgotten what it is.
Uh...
And now, in conclusion, I'd like to tell you a humorous anecdote.
I know several humorous anecdotes, but I can't think of any way to clean 'em up!
So I'll only say this much.
I love the Cornbelt Loan and Trust Company.
Some say that the bank is suffering from hardening of the arteries and of the heart.
I refuse to listen to such radical talk.
I say that our bank is alive, it's generous, it's... it's human!
And we're going to have such a line of customers seeking and getting small loans that people will think we're gambling with the depositors' money.
And we will be!
We'll be gambling on the future of this country.
I thank you.
Woody, I can't take it any more.
Let's sit down.
We can't get out.
I'm trapped.
How do you do?
Ow!
Beg your pardon!
Well, anyway, we can't fall down.
Is that table satisfactory?
- Everything's lovely.
Thank you very much.
Would you care to order now?
Sorry.
I can't understand it.
- What?
Why you're not mad about me.
I think I'm attractive.
You are, Woody.
You're irresistible.
Then why do you go on resisting me?
All marriages don't have to be like that one.
Which one?
- Your friends, Fred and Marie.
What's wrong with their marriage?
- Nothing, except one slight detail.
They just don't like each other.
It's murder on the dance floor.
It's awful!
You don't wanna dance any more?
- Love to! You don't mind if I borrow him?
No, not at all.
Why did you do this, Peggy?
- Do what? What do you mean?
Calling up Marie and going out like this. Together.
I did it deliberately.
- Why?
To prove to myself that what happened this afternoon didn't really happen.
But it did happen.
It had to happen.
And if we go on seeing each other, Peggy, it'll happen again.
Be- bop a- ree- bop
Be- bop...
Excuse us.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
We want to have a picture taken in a few minutes.
Fine.
I'll be here.
Excuse me.
Hello, Marie.
- Good evening.
You got to watch yourself.
More wolves! - I know.
I'd pay no attention to the sign.
Go right in!
Gee, Woody's a cute boy.
- He's a lot of fun.
He's got dough, too.
His family own half the city.
He has a terrific yen for you.
I don't want to butt into your affairs, but if you take my advice, you'll grab Woody!
Woody and I are good friends, but there's no romance.
Never mind the romantic part. That takes care of itself. I speak from experience.
They'll tell you money isn't everything.
Maybe it isn't but, boy, how it helps!
While Fred was away I was drawing over $500 a month.
I mean, from his army pay and the job I had.
Now the two of us gotta live on what Fred gets from the drugstore. 32.50 a week!
Poor Fred. Bet you think he's a sourpuss.
He didn't used to be that way, though.
Army's had an awful effect on him.
Knocked all the life out of him!
Fred isn't going to be satisfied with that job at the drugstore.
He'll get something better. - Maybe in five years he'll draw 50 bucks.
You can't have happy marriages on that kind of dough.
You know, Peggy, you're cute.
But you could use a little more make- up.
And get yourself a better hairdo.
I'll give you the name of my hairdresser.
Oh, but you've got nothing to worry about.
You'll get Woody and live happily ever after. It's in the bag!
Thank you.
Now, everybody get in close together, put our arms around each other.
Come on, Fred.
I don't mind.
Ooh! Wait, I'll tell you when.
Everybody, happy. Let's all be talking.
What a marvellous party.
We'll have to do this again.
OK, shoot the picture!
We want four copies, honey.
Mr Milton certainly acted enthusiastic about your speech.
Yeah, sure. That's how he acted, the old hypocrite.
Suppose he'll fire you in the morning?
- No, he'll never do anything impetuous.
He'll back me up, till the next time
I give a loan to some little guy.
Then I'll have to fight it out again.
Yes?
- lt's me, Peggy.
Oh, come in, darling.
Did you have a good time?
- Not very.
Ah, what's all this?
Children's Hour?
I beg your pardon.
Well?
What's she like?
I'm glad I went out with them.
Even though it was a disagreeable experience.
It took guts, honey.
But you got plenty.
I'll need them.
I've made up my mind.
Good girl.
- To do what?
I'm going to break that marriage up.
I can't stand seeing Fred tied to a woman he doesn't love.
And who doesn't love him.
It's horrible for him. It's humiliating, and it's killing his spirit.
Somebody's got to help him.
Are you sure he doesn't love her?
- Of course I am.
Did he tell you?
Did she?
- No.
So you just jumped to conclusions!
He doesn't love her, he hates her. I know it.
I know it.
- Who are you, God?!
How did you get this power to interfere in people's lives?
Is Fred in love with you?
Yes.
You've been seeing him?
- Only once. Today.
Oh, it was all perfectly respectable.
But when we were saying goodbye, he... he took me in his arms and kissed me and... and I knew.
You think a kiss from a smooth operator like Fred means anything?!
You don't know him. You don't know anything about what's inside him.
Neither does she.
His wife.
That's probably what she thought - a smooth operator with money in his pockets.
But now he isn't smooth any longer, and she's lost interest.
Whereas you're possessed of all the wisdom of the ages
You can see into the secret recesses of his innermost soul
I can see because I love him.
So you're gonna break this marriage up. Have you decided how?
Are you gonna do it with an axe?
It's none of your business how I'm going to do it!
You've forgotten what it's like to be in love!
Hear that? I'm so old and decrepit, I've forgotten how it feels to want somebody.
Peggy didn't mean that.
Did you, darling?
No.
I don't know what I do mean.
It's just that everything has always been so perfect for you.
You loved each other and you got married in a big church and you had a honeymoon in the South of France.
You never had any trouble of any kind.
So how can you possibly understand how it is with Fred and me?
We never had any trouble?
How many times have I told you I hated you and believed it in my heart?
How many times have you said you were sick of me, that we were all washed up?
How many times have we had to fall in love all over again?
I'm sorry, Mom.
Never mind about that, darling.
Fred.
- Hiya, Butch.
Hello, Fred.
- Al here?
He's back there, waiting for you.
- See you later.
Hiya, Al.
- Sit down, Fred.
What are you drinking? - A cup of coffee. Gotta have a clear head.
A cup of coffee and a bourbon and soda. - Yes, sir.
What's on your mind, Al? Want to borrow some money or something?
I, uh... called you to ask you a question.
OK.
Shoot.
Are you in love with Peggy?
Is there a law compelling me to answer? - No.
Nevertheless, I repeat: are you in love with Peggy?
Yes.
I thank you for a short and honest answer.
You're welcome.
Now what do we take up next?
Your wife.
What about her?
Where does she fit in this romantic situation?
Is that any of your business?
That's what Peggy said
- that it's none of my business.
Oh, you've had her on the carpet, too.
She volunteered some information to her mother and me.
You see, we have a rather unusual relationship in our family.
It may seem corny and mid- Victorian, but we tell each other things.
I happen to be quite fond of Peggy, and I...
You don't want her mixed up with a heel.
I haven't called you a heel.
Yet.
I just don't want to see her get into this mess.
OK, chum, what do we do now?
Step out and settle this thing in the alley?
I wouldn't want to recommend that as a solution.
I've learned to fight dirty.
If I got tangled up with you,
I might break your neck.
I wouldn't like that.
You see, I'm quite fond of you, too.
- Thanks.
But I don't like the idea of you sneaking around corners to see Peggy, taking her love on a bootleg basis.
I give you fair warning, I'll do everything
I can to keep her away from you, to help her forget about you and get her married to a guy who'll make her happy.
Then I guess that's it, Al.
I don't see her any more.
I'll put that in the form of a guarantee.
I won't see her any more.
I'll call her up and tell her so.
That satisfy you?
- Yeah.
Anything else on your mind?
- No.
OK, chum.
So long.
So long, Fred.
The drinks are on me.
Hello, Homer.
- Hi, Steve.
Say, Al Stephenson's back there.
Al?
- Yeah.
Hi, Al.
- Hello, Homer.
How are you?
- Fine, thanks.
Hello, Homer.
- Hi, Butch.
Say, let's show Al that new routine.
- Sure.
Got something to show you,
Al. Well, come on.
Boy, wait till you hear this.
- All set, kid?
I'm ready when you are.
- OK. One, two, three.
That's fine!
What's the matter?
Didn't you like it, Al?
Sure, it was swell. I thought you were kidding about the piano lessons.
Fred!
Hey, Fred!
That was Fred.
Yeah.
Is anything wrong? - No, he had to go back to the drugstore.
Come on, Homer, buy me a drink.
Who was it?
Fred.
He said he's sorry for what happened, but it was just one of those things.
He said it wouldn't be fair to his wife for us to see each other any more because...
I'm obviously the kind of girl that takes these things too seriously.
Then he said goodbye, very politely, and hung up.
Well, I guess you and Dad won't have to worry about me any more.
That's the end of my career as a home- wrecker.
Mom, I know you feel sorry for me.
You think my poor little heart is broken.
But you can save your sympathy.
I can see things clearer now.
I made a fool of myself.
I'm getting some sense hammered into me now.
I'm glad I'm out of that mess.
I'm glad I'll never see him again!
I...
Two chocolate sundaes coming up.
What about a ham and cheese on whole- wheat?
Ham and cheese coming up.
Here you are.
Thank you.
Hello, Homer. How've you been?
- Hi, Fred.
Glad to see you.
- Say, Fred.
Yeah?
- What happened at Butch's?
What do you mean?
- You and Al. Was there any trouble?
Oh, no. We were just having a little friendly chat.
There you are, sir.
- Thanks.
What'll yours be, Homer? - Oh, I don't care. A chocolate sundae.
OK.
Hi.
How are you, soldier?
- Sailor.
Excuse me.
Say, uh... do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
I know what it is. How did I get these hooks, and how do they work?
That's what everybody says when they start off "Mind if I ask you a question?"
Well, I'll tell you. I got sick and tired of that old pair of hands I had.
An awful lot of trouble, washing them and manicuring my nails.
So I traded them in for these latest models.
They work by radar.
Look.
Pretty cute, eh?
- You got plenty of guts.
It's terrible when you see a guy like you that had to sacrifice himself. For what?
For what?! I don't get you, mister.
- Well...
Anything else for you?
- Check.
We let ourselves get sold down the river. We were pushed into war.
Sure, by the Japs and the Nazis.
The Germans and the Japs had nothing against us.
They wanted to fight the limeys and the Reds.
They would've whipped 'em, too, if we didn't get deceived into it by Washington.
What are you talking about?
We fought the wrong people, that's all.
Just read the facts, my friend. Find out for yourself why you had to lose your hands.
Then go out and do something about it.
- You'd better pay your check and go.
Well, who do you think you are?
- Pay the cashier right over there.
Coffee, please.
- Yes, ma'am.
There's another thing. Every soda jerk in this country's got an idea he's somebody!
What are you selling anyway?
I'm not selling anything but plain old- fashioned Americanism.
Some Americanism!
So we're all a bunch of suckers?
So we should've been on the side of the Japs and the Nazis?
Again I say, just look at the facts.
I've seen facts. I've seen a ship go down, and 400 of my shipmates went with it.
Were those guys suckers?!
That's the unpleasant truth, and the sooner we get wise to it...
Ooh, if I only had my hands!
- You put those down!
Take your hands off him!
May I get through, please?
Go get the druggist.
- Yes, sir.
Make way, please.
What happened?
It was Fred Derry. He hit him.
- Bring some iodine and bandages.
Yes, sir.
- Don't say it, chum.
The customer's always right, so I'm fired. But this customer wasn't right.
I'll meet you outside in a minute, kid.
Gee, Fred, I'm sorry I lost you your job. But that guy...
Yeah, I know. You read about guys like that, but you don't often see 'em, luckily.
How about your girlfriend
- Wilma?
You and she gonna get married?
- I don't know.
Why don't you know?
Doesn't she want to get married?
It isn't Wilma's fault.
She's been swell about it.
So then it's your fault?
- Yeah, I... I guess it is.
Will you do me a favour, Homer?
- Sure, Fred. What is it?
I'm a hot one to be giving advice to the lovelorn, but go see Wilma - now.
Take her in your arms, kiss her, ask her to marry you, then marry her.
Tomorrow, if you can get a licence.
If you want anybody to stand up for you at your wedding... There's my bus. So long.
So long, Fred.
You all right?
- I'm just going to get a glass of milk.
Just knock on the door when you want me.
OK.
Wilma!
What are you doing out this hour?
I saw you were up, Homer.
I saw you through the window.
I've got to talk to you.
All right, come in.
Want some chicken?
- No, thanks.
Sure?
- Yes.
Want a glass of milk?
- No, thanks, Homer.
Sit down, Wilma.
Homer, I... My family want me to go away, tomorrow.
Where? - Up to Silver Lake.
My Aunt Vera's place.
That ought to be nice.
But I don't want to go.
I want to stay here.
You see, the reason they want me to go is so that I'll forget about you.
They figure you don't want me around, you don't want to see me, and if I go away for a while, maybe
I'll get all this out of my mind.
Maybe that's a good idea, Wilma.
Maybe you ought to do that.
Do you want to get rid of me?
Tell me the truth, Homer. Do you want me to forget about you?
I want you to be free, Wilma.
To live your own life.
I don't want you tied down forever just because you've got a kind heart.
Homer, why can't you understand the way things really are? The way I really feel?
I keep trying to tell you.
But... but you don't know, Wilma.
You don't know what it'd be like to have to live with me, to have to... face this every day, every night.
But I can only find out by trying.
If it turns out I haven't courage enough, we'll soon know it.
Wilma, you and I have been close to each other for a long time, haven't we?
Ever since we were kids.
Yes, Homer.
I'm going upstairs to bed.
I want you to... I want you to come up and see for yourself what happens.
All right, Homer.
I've learned how to take this harness off.
I can wiggle into my pyjama top.
I'm lucky, I have my elbows.
Some of the boys don't.
But I can't button 'em up.
- I'll do that, Homer.
This is when I know I'm helpless.
My hands are down there on the bed.
I can't put them on again without calling to somebody for help.
I can't smoke a cigarette or read a book.
If that door should blow shut, I can't open it and get out of this room.
As dependent as a baby that doesn't know how to get anything except cry for it.
Well, now you know, Wilma.
Now you have an idea of what it is.
I guess you don't know what to say.
It's all right. Go on home.
Go away, like your family said.
I know what to say, Homer.
I love you.
And I'm never going to leave you.
Never.
You mean, you... you didn't mind?
Of course not.
I told you I loved you.
I love you, Wilma.
I always have, and... and I always will.
Good night, darling.
Sleep well.
Good night, Wilma.
Hey, sugar. You'd better step on it, or your husband'll be home.
He's job- hunting. He won't come home for another hour.
And what if he does?
- I don't understand it.
All this money around and he can't get into it. What's wrong with him?
I guess he just isn't very bright.
How do you do?
Fine, thanks.
Who are you?
Fred, I want you to meet Cliff Scully, an old friend of mine.
Hiya, Freddy.
- Glad to know you, Scully. Get out.
A tough guy, huh?
- Now listen, Fred.
You won't get anywhere with that attitude. Cliff's an old friend.
He's asked me out, and I'm going out.
You heard me, chum. Get out.
- What do I do next? Smack him?
Why ask her?
Can't you think for yourself?
Go on. I can handle this.
Wait for me downstairs.
OK.
Another ex- serviceman, huh?
Greetings. Have you had any trouble getting readjusted?
Not in particular. It's easy if you just take everything in your stride.
That's what I've heard.
Be seeing you.
- I doubt it.
When did you pick him up?
- He's an old friend.
He just dropped in for a friendly drink.
Did you know him while I was away?
- I knew lots of people.
What do you think I did all those years?
- I don't know, but I can guess.
Go ahead, guess.
I could do some guessing myself.
What were you up to in London and Paris and all those places?
I've given you every chance to make something of yourself. I gave up my job.
I gave up the best years of my life!
And what have you done? You've flopped.
Couldn't even hold a job at the drugstore.
So I'm going back to work for myself.
And I'm going to live for myself, too.
And in case you don't understand
English, I'm gonna get a divorce.
What have you got to say to that?
Don't keep Cliff waiting.
What are you gonna do?
- I'm going away.
Where? - As far away from
Boone City as I can get.
That's a good idea.
You'll get a good job someplace else.
There are drugstores everywhere.
Here's an old sweater I found.
Remember?
Sure.
- You might need it sometime.
Thanks, Hortense.
- You forgot these, son.
Oh, I don't want 'em, Pop.
- What are they?
Fancy words that don't mean anything. You can throw 'em away.
Say, these are citations for your medals.
Why, Freddy, you never showed them to us.
Those things came in the packages with K rations.
Well, we'll treasure them, my boy.
I'll get the socks I washed for you.
Think you're doing the right thing, son?
Going? Who's to say in advance whether it's the right thing or the wrong thing?
It just means a fresh start in some other place.
How do you know it'll be different anyplace else?
There's a need here for fellas like yourself that fought and won the war.
I know you haven't had the best of breaks since you got back, but... you ought to stick here and slug it out a while longer on your own home ground.
You're all right, Pop.
But I know when it's time to bail out.
I gotta get going.
Here are your clean socks, Fred.
- Just put 'em in here.
Take good care of the old man.
- I'll do my best.
But we'll miss you, Freddy. - You ought to be used to that by now.
So long, Pop.
We've got two flights going out of here tonight. One eastbound, one westbound.
You'll have to ask the pilot.
Which way you going?
Which one leaves first?
Eastbound.
Eight o'clock.
That'll be fine. I'll just hang around the field until then.
You don't seem to care where you're going.
That's right, chum.
I don't.
Hortense.
Hortense!
Listen to this.
Sit down.
"Headquarters, 8th Air Force. Award of the Distinguished Flying Cross."
Um... Here.
"Despite intense pain, shock and loss of blood, with complete disregard of his personal safety,
Captain Derry crawled back to his bombsight, guided his formation on a perfect run over the objective and released his bombs with great accuracy."
"The heroism, devotion to duty, professional skill and coolness under fire displayed by Captain Derry, under the most difficult conditions, reflect highest credit on himself and the
Armed Forces of the United States."
"By command of Lieutenant
General Doolittle."
Hey, bud, what are you doing up there?
Hey, you!
What are you doing in that airplane?
I used to work in one of those.
- Reviving old memories, huh?
Or maybe getting some of 'em out of my system.
Well, take your last look.
We're breaking 'em up.
Yeah, I know. You're the junkman.
You get everything sooner or later.
This is no junk. We're using this material for building prefabricated houses.
You don't need any help, do you?
Out of a job?
- That's it.
I see. One of the fallen angels of the air force.
Well, pardon me if I show no sympathy.
While you glamour boys were up in the wild blue yonder, I was down in a tank.
Sometime I'll be glad to hear the story of your war experiences.
What I asked you for was a job.
Have you got one?
Do you know anything about building?
- No. But I know how to learn.
Same as I learned that job up there.
Hey, Gus.
- Yes?
See if you think this guy can be of any use to us.
Thanks.
Now, children, let's remember the words.
The bride will come down those stairs.
When I see her I'll hit the first note, then I'll nod my head and then we'll sing, huh?
All right, let's try it.
Here she comes.
-  Here...
Wait for the note.
Here's comes the bri...
That's fine.
Mrs Cameron?
- Yes. Mrs Stephenson?
Yes.
- Come right in, won't you?
My daughter.
- How do you do?
How do you do, Mrs Cameron?
- How do you do?
There you go.
- You shouldn't have.
My daughter.
- Miss Stephenson.
Hello.
- Hello, Mr Cameron.
Meet Homer's folks.
Mr and Mrs Stephenson.
Miss Stephenson.
How do you do?
- How do you do?
Hello, Al.
- Hello, Butch!
It's good you're here.
- Mr Stephenson, punch?
Hello, Butch.
How do you do, Mrs Stephenson?
- How do you do?
Steady, boy!
I heard you were leaving town. I was afraid you wouldn't stand up for me.
I'll stand up for you, kid, till I drop.
Oh, Fred, here's the ring.
Don't lose it.
Hiya, Homer. Big day, huh?
- Hi, Al.
Hiya, Fred.
- Hello, Al.
I, uh... I hear you moved back with your folks.
Yeah.
I've sampled the punch. I presume it was made for the kiddies.
Will you have some, Homer?
- I might give the wrong answers.
How about you, Fred?
- No, thanks. Maybe later.
Well, if I must be a solitary drinker, good luck, kid.
Thank you, Al.
- Al! You promised you wouldn't.
Take a sip of this.
- Hello, Fred. Homer.
There isn't a headache in a barrel of it. - Al can take it.
He certainly can.
- Excuse me.
See for yourself.
Hello, Fred.
Nice to see you again.
Hello, Peggy.
Nice to see you.
Well, what have you been doing with yourself lately?
Working.
Yes... Dad told me he heard you were in some kind of building work.
Well, it's a hopeful way of putting it.
I'm really in the junk business.
An occupation for which many people feel I'm well qualified, by temperament and training.
It's fascinating work.
Where's Homer? Wilma's ready.
- I'll get him.
Excuse me.
Mary, Kay, go ahead.
Jackie. Jackie!
Over here.
Watch me.
Here comes the bride
All dressed in white
Sweetly serene in the soft, glowing light
Lovely to see
Marching to thee
Sweet love united
For eternity
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God and this company to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony.
If any man can show just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together, let him now speak, or else hereafter forever hold his peace.
Homer, wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded wife?
I will.
Wilma, wilt thou have this man to thy wedded husband?
I will.
Who gives this woman to be married to this man?
I do.
Now, Homer, will you take Wilma's right hand in yours and say after me:
I, Homer, take thee, Wilma, to my wedded wife.
I, Homer, take thee, Wilma, to my wedded wife.
To have and to hold from this day forward.
To have and to hold from this day forward.
For better, for worse.
For richer, for poorer.
For better, for worse.
For richer, for poorer.
In sickness and in health. To love and to cherish till death us do part.
In sickness and in health. To love and to cherish till death do... us do part.
Now, Wilma, with your right hand, take
Homer by his right hand and say after me:
I, Wilma, take thee, Homer, to my wedded husband.
I, Wilma, take thee, Homer, to my wedded husband.
To have and to hold from this day forward.
To have and to hold from this day forward.
For better, for worse.
For richer, for poorer.
For better, for worse.
For richer, for poorer.
In sickness and in health. To love and to cherish till death us do part.
In sickness and in health. To love and to cherish till death us do part.
The ring.
Place it on the fourth finger of Wilma's left hand.
Repeat after me:
With this ring,
I thee wed.
With this ring,
I thee wed.
Those whom God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
For as much as Homer and Wilma have consented together in holy wedlock and have witnessed the same before God and this company, and thereto have given and pledged their troth, each to the other, and have declared the same by giving and receiving a ring, and by joining hands,
I pronounce that they are man and wife.
God bless you both.
You know what it'll be, don't you, Peggy?
It may take us years to get anywhere.
We'll have no money, no decent place to live.
We'll have to work, get kicked around...

Enfin, ma belle.
Let go of me! How dare you, you brutes!
Let go of me.
You didn't get away this time, huh?
- She's English.
- What's she doing here?
- Stealing.
- It's a lie! Keep your dirty hands off me!
How dare you touch me!
I can buy thousands of bottles of your filthy wine.
I'll show you who I am.
Ah, I didn't recognise you. Forgive me, my lady.
My lady is right, you pig.
Qu'est-ce que vous...
Here, dearie, it'll do you good.
Thank you, dear.
You've all been very kind.
I didn't mean to get you into trouble.
No trouble at all.
I always wanted to kick that swine in the pants, anyhow. I'm glad I done it.
I'm English, too.
My name's Smith - Mary Smith.
What's yours, dearie?
- Emma.
- Emma.
I knew a girl whose name was Emma.
Emily Burrows.
What's yours?
My name?
My name is Emma Lady Hamilton.
Oh...
That's one on me.
It serves me right. I shouldn't be so nosy.
Well, darlin', if you don't want to tell me your name,
I'd be the last one to poke my nose in anybody's secrets.
I remember my mother telling me Lady Hamilton was the most beautiful woman in the world.
Have you got a mirror?
Yes.
Better you didn't, dearie.
Oh, well.
I know it.
I know that face.
For ten years it has looked back at me from different mirrors.
It must be me.
But I always wait for the miracle, that one time, just once more, when it will be another face that looks at me again.
A face I knew before.
But that face must be dead.
Go on, tell us all about it.
It doesn't matter if it's true or not.
True or not.
I don't know it myself.
It's so long ago, I don't know it anymore.
My life really began when I was 18
I was beautiful then
Coach from London!
One day I arrived in Naples
At the palace of His Excellency the British Ambassador
How's London, Gavin?
- How's my nephew? Did he send everything?
- It's all here, Your Excellency.
Give me a hand with this chisel!
- Mr Greville sends his regards.
- Don't bother me about Mr Greville now!
- Give me a hammer and chisel.
- It's most important, sir.
Exquisite.
Come and look at this.
- Enchanting. Whose work is it?
- George Romney.
If he could paint reality, he would be a master.
Isn't that reality?
The ideal an artist dreams of.
No woman ever lived with such colouring, such god-like simplicity.
I thought so too till I met her.
You've met her?
In London, last year. And if you're patient, you may see her in Naples one day.
- Your Excellency.
- Oh, not now, Gavin. I'll see you presently.
But I must tell you.
Very well, if you must, but tell me quickly.
Mum? Mum? Look, it's lovely.
It's a real palace.
Oh, I do hope Sir William will like us.
Don't worry, darling. Of course he'll like you.
I'll do all the talking. Charlie told me exactly what to answer to everything.
Why on earth didn't you tell me?
Where are they?
Sshh. Here he comes.
You must forgive me. It's disgraceful.
I'd no idea you'd come.
- How do you do, Miss er...
- Emma Hart, if it pleases Your Excellency.
- How could I forget?
- This is my mother, Your Excellency.
Welcome to Naples, madam.
This is my friend the French Ambassador.
Did you stay in Rome?
Yes, Your Excellency and thought it very beautiful.
We saw the Colosseum by moonlight and were deeply impressed by the Vatican.
We just missed the Pope by ten minutes.
That was a great pity, madam.
Did you come through Pisa?
Did you see the famous leaning tower?
Yes, Your Excellency, and we thought it very beautiful.
We thought the leaning tower of Pisa one of the most remarkable and lovely phenomena in the whole of Europe.
A chimney went like that in Liverpool last year at the soap works.
It leant right over the gin warehouse and the Bishop said it was the finger of God.
Charles - Mr Greville - sent you many kind wishes, Your Excellency.
And he hopes I will prove worthy of your kindness and speak good French and Italian when he comes to take me home in October.
He is coming the first week in October.
And er... he sent his uncle... a kiss.
Well, that's the first present I've ever received from Charles Greville.
I feel sure you must be tired after your journey, madam.
Francis, show the ladies their rooms.
Au revoir, madam. Au revoir, Miss Hart.
- Who is she?
- Charles Greville found her.
Where can you find things like that?
Charles happened to find her at Featherstone Castle - Sir Harry's place.
- Oh, she's a relation of Sir Harry?
- You might call her that.
She lived there for a whole hunting season and a very gay hunting season it was, I'm told.
Oh. And where did Sir Harry find her?
Well, you remember Dr Graham's Temple of Hell and the famous dance of the seven veils?
- She's a dancer?
- You might call her that.
She was quite a success.
The fewer the veils the greater the success.
But, alas, the police locked the place just after the last veil fell.
The older I get, the less I seem to know about women.
It's the penalty of your wicked youth,
Your Excellency.
Don't ask me what happened to her before.
The usual past, I suppose.
A poor little country girl wronged once and then wronged again.
The old story.
Lower and lower, but always up and up.
And now she's the guest of an ambassador.
With a past like that.
Past?
Look at this statue.
Two hundred years in a Greek temple.
Then thrown into the mud by some barbarian soldier.
2,000 years sinking lower and lower into the mud, then dug up by the plough of a peasant, changing hands every year until at last it comes to its rightful place.
Into the hands of someone who understands the glory of its beauty.
Because, my friend, it is still beautiful, isn't it, despite its past?
Gavin.
I'll dine tonight with Miss Hart
Alone, at eight o'clock.
GAVlN: Yes Your Excellency
Thank you, my man.
I'll ring for you later, if I want you.
Very good, madam.
Two ambassadors, Mum, two!
Well, what did you think of me?
Wasn't I wonderful?
You were all that, darling, and more.
So far, so good.
But, please, Mum, not another word about the soap factory. Not till I've married Charlie.
Charlie said Sir William was very fussy about that sort of thing.
Don't worry your pretty head about Sir William.
You'll have him eating out of your hand within three months.
Three months? Three days?
He'll be eating out of it tonight.
And in a month,
Charlie will be here to take us home.
How pleased he'll be with me.
He will indeed, but there's no great hurry.
It's very nice here just now and it's not costing us a farthing.
It's all very well for you, but what about me?
''Yes, Your Excellency. No, Your Excellency.
Of course, Your Excellency.''
- Oh, how I miss my Charlie.
- Yes, he's a likely, young fellow.
Burt there's no-one good enough for my Emily, though it's her own mother who says so.
But, Mother, I wouldn't exist without Charlie.
He's done everything for me, everything.
Well, he's... made me a lady.
I know, darling, I know.
Oh! Look at that mountain with the smoke coming out of it.
The coachman said it went off a few years ago and killed several people.
That would never happen in Liverpool.
Oh, Mother, you're hopeless. That's a famous volcano. People come miles to see it.
What do they call it? Charles told me 100 times.
Smoking mountain. Vesuvius, that's it, Vesuvius.
If Sir William asks you what you think of it, just say it's lovely.
- Yes, dear.
- It's mixed up with the history of Ancient Rome.
Nero set it on fire and said the Christians did it.
Remember, Mother, it's knowing little things like that that makes you a lady.
Whenever I have a nice piece of fish, it always makes me think of the sea.
- The what?
- The sea Your Excellency
Oh, yes.
Charles was wonderful about things like that.
- About fish?
- Oh!
You're so funny, Your Excellency.
Every time you call me ''Your Excellency'', it adds one year to my life.
- Sir William?
- That's getting better
Tell me, my dear.
Was my nephew so positive about coming here?
Oh, absolutely. He would have brought me here himself, if he hadn't been detained in London.
Just a second, my dear.
As we're to live together under the same roof
I see no reason why we should not be perfectly frank with one another
As much as I hate to spoil this beautiful picture that you have drawn for yourseIf of my nephew, there's one point that must be made quite clear.
Charles Greville will never come to Naples
But, Your Excellency, Uncle, he definitely promised.
There is a wide gap between my nephew's promises and his fulfilment of them
The promise he gave me, he will keep.
Your confidence in him is really touching.
Did he promise you marriage as well?
Why deny it? It must be written all over me.
I'm afraid I've got to destroy those sweet dreams of yours.
My nephew never had the slightest intention of marrying you.
Either with my consent or without it.
What did you say, Your Excellency?
I said he's not going to marry you, Emma.
But that's not possible.
Why should he send me here with my mother?
It costs a lot of money, the journey.
Perhaps he feIt you would be better off with his uncle. A nice vacation.
But I didn't need a vacation.
No. No, there must be something else.
And what's to happen after the vacation, if he doesn't want to marry me?
He's talked of nothing else for years.
It was his idea. I never urged him.
I was quite happy with him just as it was.
Tell me, Your Excellency, but please tell me the truth.
Did Charles tell you about me?
Do you know about my
He did. And I imagine that was the only thing he did not lie about.
Oh but please my dear,
I don't want to make you feel ashamed.
Ashamed? Oh, I'm not ashamed.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
It's true there were men in my life before Charles, I admit it.
I made mistakes, I was young, I was stupid.
I believed in men and their promises.
Charles knew about me before he took me into the house, before he promised to marry me.
And now I'm different, not only my clothes, but inside.
I'm good. I know I'm good.
So why should he lie to me?
Why did he send me here?
What am I doing here?
Charles had a lot of debts. Did you know that?
Yes, quite a lot, I know.
His debts have been paid to the tune of £5,000.
Besides he has plenty of cash to save him from new debts for a long time
Oh, I see. see
He sold you antiques, paintings, and among the bric-a-brac, a certain Emma Hart.
That wasn't fair.
That wasn't gentlemanlike.
He shouldn't have raised me up just to throw me down again.
My dear.
Leave me alone. You're just as bad as he is.
Perhaps you haven't made such a good bargain after all.
I'm not going to stay here.
I'm going away now. Now!
Oh, don't take it to heart, my dear.
Forget Charles, forget the old memories, forget London.
I can offer you a new life and a far more exciting one.
Naples is a wonderful city.
You'll be a success here. You'll like it.
Perhaps not today, nor even tomorrow.
But you are young and the young heal quickly.
You will learn singing and music under the greatest masters in Italy.
You will speak French and Italian with our finest teachers.
Everyone of account in Europe comes to my house. You will meet them all.
You will dine with famous soldiers, artists and statesmen.
You can't be presented at court, of course, but you will have a villa by the sea and a coach.
You will have your private box at the opera.
Ever since I first saw you in London,
I feIt this house of mine to be empty, missing its greatest and most lovely ornament.
You will be that ornament, my dear.
And except for that absurd presentation at court, you will have everything in life that a woman could possibly dream of.
What did you say?
Nothing. Try to sleep.
Goodnight, Emma.
MOTHER: What's wrong, darling?
Oh, mum!
Dear, dear.
Mum, I'm so miserable.
- What's wrong?
- He never wanted to marry me.
He got £5,000 from the old man to send me here.
He never wanted to marry me.
Don't cry, my sweet.
You're too good for any of them.
I'm going to pack now.
We'll go right back to London and you can give that precious Mr Greville a piece of your mind.
Plenty of good men want to marry my Emily.
There, now, darling. Don't cry.
There's just as good fish in the sea as ever came out of it.
Darling, precious Emily, there, now.
And I forgot London and the old memories.
I was young I healed quickly.
I learnt French, Italian, singing, and music.
One day I had more than I ever dreamed of.
I became his wife - Emma Lady Hamilton.
Sshh!
My daughter, Her Ladyship, is still asleep.
- Good morning, Contessa.
- Good morning.
My daughter, Her Ladyship, is still resting.
Perhaps you wouldn't mind waiting a little while.
- How was Her Majesty this morning?
- Her cold is troublesome. Her throat is sore.
- Has it gone out of her nose?
-No.
The best way to cure a sore throat is to wrap a woollen sock at night, going to bed.
- Oh?
- Good morning. Good morning, Contessa.
Good morning, Your Excellency.
- Is Emma still asleep?
- She is asleep.
In my village, a husband just turns round in bed and looks for himseIf to know.
Yes, and the Queen of Naples does not wear woollen socks to pin around her throat.
If the Queen of Naples wore a hefty pair of woollen socks, she wouldn't have a sore throat.
- What's happened?
- I don't know.
Maybe the smoking mountain went off again.
Let's see. Come along.
How wonderful! A battleship.
You should see the Queen about this.
Salutes at this hour of the morning.
Why shouldn't they blow their cannons off?
That's what they've got them for.
Boom!
- Boom!
- Good morning, my dear.
Boom! Good morning, William.
Here, give it to me.
? Rule Britannia
Let me look, my dear.
There's a small boat coming ashore.
They will probably need me.
Excuse me, my dear.
- The mail is just in, Emma.
- I'll attend to it later.
Here's a nice fat one from London.
Oh.
Her Excellency, Emma Lady Hamilton,
British Embassy, Naples.
Charles Greville, London.
Open it, child, open it.
I think not. Send it back and write on it, ''Unopened. Return to sender''.
Poor Charles. He's exactly three years too late.
And as far as I'm concerned, he simply doesn't exist.
Are you happy, my child?
Happy?
Three years ago, my only idea of happiness was to be married to Charles Greville.
After that, I wanted revenge.
Well, I got that in a way, too.
Then I wanted to be presented at court.
And even that impossible wish was granted to me.
I've got everything.
Everything a woman of the world could possibly wish for.
So why shouldn't I be happy?
Of course, I'm happy, Mother.
Well, Emma, what's good enough for you is good enough for me.
And being mother to Her Ladyship is not to be sneezed at either.
You silly old thing.
You're lovely, Emma.
You're so beautiful, Emma.
And what about you? Look at you with your little cap and your silver buttons.
And your beautiful skirt.
You're the beautiful one.
Your Ladyship, could you spare me a moment, please?
Yes, Gavin. I'm in a great hurry.
It's about the dinner invitations for Sunday night.
Then, of course, His Eminence the Archbishop, the Duchess of Argyle, and if there's no performance the Prima Donna of the San Carlo.
- And the two ladies - which is deaf?
- The Contessa Giovanni.
We put her on Sir William's right.
Marquess Compiani the old harpy, and the French Ambassador - we'll put him there between them.
Oh, he'll have a nice time.
Beg pardon, My Lady, but Sir William informs me the French Ambassador cannot be invited.
- Why ever not?
- Sir William mentioned
Sir William mentioned... Sir William mentioned there's a difference between the er...
William, what's this absurd business about the French Ambassador? l need him for the party on Sunday night.
My dear, may I introduce the captain of the Agamemnon?
How do you do? But William, I need him.
He's amusing and he's a bachelor and I need a single man to make my number even.
I'm sorry, my dear, but we won't be seeing the French Ambassador for quite some time.
Why? What's the matter with him?
The captain can explain that.
- He has a message.
- We're at war with France.
War? That's torn it.
Bang goes the French Ambassador.
Oh, dear. Who can I get to sit between these two dreary old ladies?
My dear captain, we shall be so delighted if you will dine with us on Sunday night.
You will sit between the two most amusing and charming ladies in Naples.
You're very kind, but I sail tonight.
Oh, then I gather you must be in a hurry.
Don't let me disturb your conference. I'm going.
Well, Captain, you were saying that the Admiral of the Fleet wanted...
Yes, sir.
Lord Hood advised me to instruct you...
It's all right, Captain,
I have no secrets from Lady Hamilton.
I'm very sorry, Sir William. You must forgive me.
I'm not used to discussing matters of this kind in the presence of ladies.
Oh. Is it as wicked as all that? Good gracious.
I promised to be with the Queen at 1 2.
She won't order a single new dress until I've discussed the patterns with her.
That's a very great responsibility, my dear.
- Goodbye, William.
- Goodbye.
We've captured Toulon.
The Admiral needs 10 000 troops to hold it
It would take three weeks from England
From here, they should be in Toulon in two days.
The treaty between England and Naples provides full co-operation and the Admiral expects you to secure those troops from the King of Naples.
I'll apply for an audience with the King.
But surely in a matter as urgent as this, we could see the King at once.
At once? I can't just walk into the Royal Palace.
Well, when will you get the audience?
Friday may be possible.
Saturday almost certain.
But we must have these troops immediately.
You must leave this in my hands.
You see, I know these people and you don't.
I'll make out the application at once.
EMMA: Yes, that's me too.
Do you like it? It's a Romney.
Circe watching her lover sail away.
Is it?
You know, I could get you those troops like that.
You were speaking rather loudly, Captain, and the houses get so stuffy if you close the doors.
You're worried, aren't you?
You have an important mission, haven't you?
Has it ever occurred to you that women can sometimes be of more help than men?
Not in a matter of this kind, Lady Hamilton.
How do you know?
It just happens that I shall be seeing the Queen within the next ten minutes.
The Queen? This is an important matter of state.
All the more reason to see the Queen.
Now I'll let you into a secret, Captain.
Which everyone in Europe knows.
Except you, Captain.
The real King of Naples is the Queen.
E licenziata, hai capito?
Her Majesty is pleased to be with her children this hour.
But my orders are to let My Lady in any time.
Even if the princes and princesses please to be with their august parents.
The august family appears to be pretty big.
The marriage of the august parents is continuously blessed.
There are 15 princes and princesses so far.
You will see.
Lady Hamilton!
''I have the honour to be etc, etc, etc.''
And I'll sign it at once.
Phew!
Here we are, Captain. I'll have this application to the palace in haIf an hour.
I thought it advisable to ask for only 8,000 men.
We may get as many as 5,000.
We asked for 20,000 and we got 1 0,000. There.
I'm very much indebted to Lady Hamilton
Her campaign against the Queen was a masterpiece of strategy.
Well, there, my dear captain, you see the real Ambassador to Naples.
At least to the Queen of Naples.
Captain, now that you have your soldiers, there's no need for you to leave so soon.
You can go tomorrow. We'll have a wonderful party on your ship tonight.
I'll bring the Queen and you'll get the King if you'll allow him to conduct the ship's orchestra.
We'll sail out to Capri.
By midnight, we'll be at the Blue Grotto.
Capri by moonlight.
You've no idea how beautiful the world can be.
We'll decorate the ship with flowers. And I'll dance. I expect you've heard of my dances.
The Dance Of The Nymph goes beautifully with a night on a ship
I'll wear a long tunic of pale blue cashmere.
No high coiffure. Just loose hair.
Like a Greek Goddess Gavin we're to have a party on the battleship tonight
Get out the Chinese lanterns to send to the harbour.
And ask the chef to make big steak pies,
100 of them.
And get some rum for the sailors.
It is rum they drink, isn't it, Captain?
It will be magnificent, stupendous.
- Won't I be wonderful, William?
- You will.
I'm sorry to be ungallant, but I've just been summoned to weigh anchor immediately.
May I present my son, midshipman on the Agamemnon?
Such a big son.
- My step-son.
-Your wife lives in England?
Yes, sir, in Norfolk.
And this young man is your chaperone.
Precisely. He keeps a good watch on me.
- Goodbye, Sir William.
- Goodbye, Captain.
Goodbye, Lady Hamilton.
May I say, you've done good service for your country?
It's been rather fun, hasn't it? If you're passing
Naples again, I hope you'll come and see us.
And next time, there's no need to blow off your cannons, just knock at the door.
Goodbye.
What was your name?
Nelson.
William, did I seem very silly, talking about the party in the moonlight?
Silly? Of course, my dear.
But delightfully silly. My Emma at her best.
I wonder.
He was so serious.
All of a sudden, I began to feel foolish.
I don't think a woman can be at her best, playing the fool with news of war.
Don't think about it, my dear.
War is a sordid, ugly thing, so there's no need for them to bother you.
My Lady, your dancing master's here.
- Shall I show him to the dancing room?
-No, send him away.
- But, Emma.
- I don't feel like dancing.
William, you've left certain gaps in my education. This war, for instance.
- I know nothing about it.
- But my dear...
Every time I ask you a serious question, you begin shuffling about.
Tell me about it. How did it happen?
- It's very dull, my dear.
- I don't care how dull it is. I want to know.
Well... here's England.
Such a tiny little bit.
Where are we?
Here at Naples.
But why should England fight?
Because all through these centuries, she has built up a commonwealth, in which every little spot has its purpose and value to the balance line of life.
And there are always men, who for the sake of their insane ambition, want to destroy what other people build.
And therefore, this tiny little bit, as you call it, Emma, has to send out its ships again and again to fight those who want to dictate their will to others.
EMMA: Then came five years of war
We fought alone with no allies
The whole of Europe in deadly fear of Napoleon Bonaparte
Nothing between him and the conquest of the world but a few ships
And Nelson
MAN: His Majesty is pleased to award you the Knighthood of the Bath and you are promoted to Rear Admiral of the Blue
Sir Horatio, that's wonderful.
The men will be delighted.
Oh, yes.
We'll catch Bonaparte in a week, if we have an extra button on our coat tails.
Five years of this war and gentlemen in London think that men can go on without water or food.
And I can fight the enemy without ammunition.
Even His Excellency the Ambassador here sees fit to ignore our plight.
What's the matter with the lamp?
It's nearly empty, sir. No more oil on board.
Well, turn it down.
NELSON: Hardy?
- Yes, sir.
Sir Horatio from now on, sir.
Oh, not to you, Hardy.
Captain always, I hope.
Captain or Sir Horatio,
I can't stand this any longer.
What's Sir William Hamilton doing?
Why don't we sail up to Naples and blow 'em out of their beds?
They'd give us water and meat then.
- Do you expect me to fire at a neutral port?
- Neutral?
Neutral against England?
Yes. Things were different when we were here five years ago, weren't they?
Our braid was shining in those days.
Today they won't even let us anchor in the harbour as though we had the plague.
They're so scared of Bonaparte, they daren't help the people who fight him.
Starboard!
What a wonderful way to get upstairs.
How exciting.
At last I'm on a battleship.
NELSON: Trowbridge, did you get anything?
Sir, there is someone here with me.
- The Ambassador.
- No sir Lady Hamilton
Is there no light? I can't see anything.
Everything's so dark.
Where's Horatio?
Turn up the lamp Josiah
NELSON: How is Sir William? Ill, I presume?
You must please forgive me if I seem a little abrupt.
We've been living here under great difficulties.
No food or fresh water.
No rum no tobacco
The Neapolitans have forgotten that they're our allies and that we're fighting for their cause too.
That is why I sent Trowbridge to ask Sir William to remind the King...
What is the matter?
Oh... Why, I'm sorry, yes.
You must please excuse these little souvenirs of Calvi and Tenerife.
I had no idea.
They told us of your victories, but not of the price you had paid.
Do not distress yourself, please.
Tell me your news. Did Sir William see the King?
- The King refused to see him.
- Refused to see the British Ambassador?
I ought to have said he was too terrified to see him.
You cannot realise how Naples has changed.
Have they gone out of their senses?
What do they think I am trying to do?
Bonaparte's fleet is in Egypt.
For the first time I know where they are.
If I can smash them up,
Europe has a chance to breathe again.
And it's the first time he's been stopped.
And yet they will not give me food or water for my ships.
When I saw that William was wasting his time,
I took the liberty of seeing the Queen.
I've never had such a time in all my life.
She's terrified of the French.
- But I got it.
- What is that?
A mandate, signed and sealed by the Queen's own hand, for the full watering and victualling of the British fleet in any port in the Kingdom of Naples.
There.
Look out, Bonaparte.
By gad, we shall lick you now.
Tell the Queen I kiss her letter.
Tell her I hope to kiss her hand when we return from our victory.
Won't you sit down? You must be tired.
Do you remember the picnic we planned at
Capri on your ship?
When I was going to dance in the moonlight with my hair down five years ago.
Or was it five centuries?
When I rudely sailed away.
And now you're going to rudely sail away again.
How's it been with you all these years?
Alone, you know.
You've done a great many things.
How is your wife?
Oh, she's well enough, I believe.
And when are you going to meet Bonaparte?
- Soon, I hope.
- He's got haIf of Europe
Now it's Egypt.
Tomorrow it may be lndia.
We are alone, but unafraid.
SAlLOR: Haul away!
You long to leave, don't you?
Never lose an hour or waste a wind
Goodbye, Sir Horatio.
It's a bit of a mouthful, isn't it?
Yes. Goodbye, Lady Hamilton.
You've helped us for the second time.
He didn't lose an hour. He didn't waste a wind.
He met his great opponent and he defeated him on the Nile
And when the battle was over he didn't go back to his country or to his king or to his wife he came back to me
- Stop. Fetch a doctor quickly.
Fetch a doctor quickly. Send everyone away.
A doctor quickly.
What's come over you, madam?
A doctor? Who wants a doctor?
But you staggered out there and nearly fell.
I'm perfectly well.
Shoul...der!
Your Majesty, I'm amazed.
Cosa dice? l must speak to the King. Help me, Sir William.
Lui vuole parlare con te.
Va bene.
Aspetta qui.
Tell him I didn't come to Naples to be feted.
In other times, I should be grateful, but today I am appalled by it.
I came here expecting to find an armed camp and I find this tragic carnival.
This Battle of the Nile that he's celebrating may have destroyed their fleet, but his army's as strong as ever and two days' from Naples.
Yet the men of Naples dance in the streets with paper caps and toy balloons.
Maestà, Nelson dice che non è venuto à Napoli per...
Qu'est qu'il y a, ma chère?
He says he has confidence in the English and feels sure they will do what is necessary.
Well, tell him we're not the guardian angels of every country too lazy to look after itself.
You've got to do something too!
At the Nile, we cleared them off the seas, but as long as they have armies on land, no country in Europe is free.
They want to get hold of the whole world.
If you value your freedom, stir yourselves.
Prepare and help drive them off the land!
Ma perche l'Ammiraglio è cosi nervoso?
I'm talking of Bonaparte, Your Majesty!
Bonaparte!
Either advance toward him sword in hand or else be kicked out of your kingdom.
Lady Hamilton, may I speak to you?
You called for a doctor just now.
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.
I thought you were ill.
Well, for heaven's sake...
..where is the doctor?
This is the third time you've helped me.
You've been here night and day. How long?
EMMA: Nine days
- What an enormous bed.
- It's my bed
There's room for six people in it.
There may be. I've never tried.
Why am in your bed?
They couldn't move you to the hospital
Of all that ghastly crowd, you were the only one who knew that I was ill.
A nice cup of beef tea.
- That'll put some go into him.
- Who's that?
It's all right, milord. Just Emma's mother.
Emma's mother...
..do you think I could call her Emma too?
Why ask me?
You've been calling her Emma all this time.
Now, don't say anymore.
Here you are.
There.
Now I'll tell you all the news and all the gossip too, if you're interested.
First item, the King of England is pleased to elevate Sir Horatio Nelson to the peerage.
You are now Lord Nelson.
Second item, the King of Naples has given you the dukedom of Bronte.
You are now a duke and a baron.
Third item, the whole of Europe sings your praises, the victor of the Nile.
It wouldn't have been possible without you.
I'm going to tell them.
I'm going to let the whole world know.
I told you not to talk. You've got to rest.
In a week, you can get up. Then for another week, you can have nothing but goat's milk.
Disgusting.
I shall be able to get up in a day or two..
You can get up when you are told you can get up.
Yes, ma'am. Goat's milk for a week and
I get up when I'm told.
That's better.
We need you now, Lord Nelson.
In these times the whole world needs you.
And I need you more than anyone else.
As soon as you are well, the King has commanded a gala performance of the opera and I want to wear my new dress from London.
Gala performance?
Opera?
When they ought to be mobilising armies.
They're doomed and don't want to realise it.
You mustn't excite yourself.
Would you do me a kindness and write a letter for me, Emma?
Of course.
To whom?
Lady Nelson.
Burnham Thorpe Norfolk England
I wonder what she looks like now.
I haven't seen her for seven years
I wonder why we sailors ever marry
Do you want that to go in?
Good heavens, no.
My dear wife
My dear wife...
My heartiest greetings from Naples to you and Father.
I'm in the house of the Hamiltons and it has taken all their care and kindness to pull me through.
I hope some day to have the pleasure of introducing you to Lady Hamilton
Lady Hamilton is one of the very best women in the world... and an honour to her sex

? Neopolitan folk song
Do you know what they're having at the palace now?
Mushrooms from Switzerland, pheasants from England, wine from Spain.
120 years old and £5 a bottle.
And here sits the hero of the evening missing it all.
Are you missing it all?
Of course not. The real and exclusive party of the evening is here.
Besides, I know exactly what's happening at the palace.
The Queen...
Ferdinando! Taci! Taci! Ferdinando!
And the King, the poor little King with 15 children and the Kingdom of Naples and never an answer to give to his queen.
And here sits the British Ambassador.
Bored and dreaming only of his last statue from Pompeii.
And throughout the evening there sits Lord Nelson, exhibiting his various moods one by one.
Lord Nelson in a bad mood.
Lord Nelson in a good mood.
Lord Nelson in an exuberant mood.
Am I really such a dull fellow?
Only when you ask questions like that.
And now it's my turn to give you a little presentation.
What mood is this?
One guess.
Nelson allowing himself to be just a little bit happy?
Nelson in love.
Of all the inns in Naples, you choose this one.
Probably the last place in Naples where they expected to find me.
Were you at the opera tonight, my dear?
No? You should have been.
There was quite a profusion of barmaids.
Some even found their way to the royal box
He's drunk. l see you're not married, my dear. What a pity.
Married women are bestowing their favours so cheaply these days
He's never behaved like this before.
Friends, I give you the real hero of the hour.
Sir William Hamilton.
That's an excellent toast, Josiah.
May I drink it with you?
Thank you.
Sir William Hamilton.
Lady Hamilton and I are leaving. Fetch a cab.
Don't let us disturb you, lads. You're off duty.
Enjoy yourselves.
Forgive them, my dear.
They are very... very young.
I have forgiven them.
That's the way people look at these things.
They do not believe in a friendship between a man and a woman.
Do you?
All right, later. Later.
It was magnificent! Stupendous!
Wasn't I wonderful, William?
Wasn't it a success?
A triumph.
The greatest ball ever seen in Naples.
You were stupendous.
You entertained 200 people as easily as you enchant a solitary husband.
The King said to me, ''Milady, la sua bellezza mi fa dimenticare tutte le pensieri della realta.''
And Hardy, good old Hardy said,
''Well, I'll be blowed, Your Ladyship.
What I mean to say is, well, you know what I mean.''
And... Oh, goodness! I'm so tired!
What did he say?
He who?
He.
Oh, he didn't say anything.
He never says much, you know.
People were saying that he should have sat on your right during dinner, not on your left
What? And give the Queen the side with the eye on it? Not likely.
He seemed very happy.
Yes, I really think he's better now.
Tonight, he seemed to forget everything.
Ships, the war, Napoleon, everything.
Could any man think of worldly cares in the spell of Emma's magic?
He deserved his happiness this evening
After such happiness how sad to find oneself the next morning at sea again.
And at war
What do you mean?
We're going to Pompeii tomorrow.
Lord Nelson will be on his way to Malta.
I think there must be some mistake, William.
Lord Nelson left ten minutes ago and said he would be with us at 12 tomorrow.
The dispatch arrived while dessert was being served.
I had it sent straight aboard his ship
He's probably reading it at this very moment
Why didn't you tell me this before, William?
But my dear I wouldn't have spoilt your evening for anything in the world
You mean, you wouldn't have spoiled yours for anything.
You tried to prevent me from saying goodbye to him
You know Emma there are three kinds of deceived husbands in the world.
First there are those who were born to be deceived.
Second, who do not know.
And third, who do not care.
I've been wondering for some time now, which of the three I should be myself.
Have you forgotten the fourth kind, William?
The kind that is hard and empty and gives nothing.
You married me because you wanted a new ornament for your house.
Like that painting or that statue or that vase.
As far as you're concerned,
I'm just as ornamental.
And just as dead.
But, my dear, how can you call my statues dead?
When I'm alone and rather tired, think what it means for me to have my statues with me.
To know that they'll always be lovely, will never grow old, and never walk out with sailors.
What a pity you're not going to see him again.
It would have been a farewell scene of lasting beauty.
I shall sleep beautifully tonight.
Good night, my dear.
My darling...come back.
Come back.
Emily, he's waiting for you...out on the balcony.
You shouldn't have come.
People will see you. They'll talk.
Oh, let them talk. I don't care. Do you?
Are you sorry?
I'm only sorry for all the wasted years
I've been without you.
For all the years I shall have to be without you.
You'll come back, won't you?
I wonder if I shall.
I feel I should not.
You are married and I am married.
In the magic and music and the ballroom, these things become rather blurred.
But they stand out very clearly in the dawn.
Your life is here.
My life is...there.
We must obey the creeds and codes that we've sworn our lives to. kn ow t h at must n ot co m e back
And I know that nothing in this world can keep me away.
Up oars!
Down!
Pull, oarsmen!
Together!
If I understand you correctly, sir, our first objective is to recover Malta.
In that case, I suggest we send the Culloden, the Lion and the Goliath, under Ball, to blockade the island and then take possession of it.
Aiuto!
Excuse me, sir.
What is it?
We've just picked up a fishing boat with refugees from Naples
Refugees from Naples?
Yes, sir. They say revolution has broken out.
The Government got away, but the King and Queen are locked up in the palace.
I don't understand everything he says sir but there must be plenty of shooting looting and murdering in the town
That's what you've always said, sir.
Just wait until we've gone. Serves them right.
If they can't help themselves nobody else can
This is Lord Keith's orders
We've got to meet the Alexander the Foudroyant and the Minotaur at the point of intersection
Blackwood, go back to your ship.
Arrange with Ball to blockade Malta.
The rest of the fleet sails to Messina
Well, what course are you taking, sir?
Back to Naples.
What are you waiting for, Trowbridge?
But, sir, Lord Keith's orders...
Lord Keith's orders are addressed to me!
Mine are addressed to you.
- Yes, sir.
- Return to your ships at once
HARDY: May I speak sir?
Yes.
I'm under your order, sir. I'll do as I'm told.
I'll sail this ship anywhere where there's water under her keel.
But I implore you, call Blackwood and Trowbridge back, and send the fleet where it's ordered to
And leave our allies the King and Queen of Naples at the mercy of that rabble?
You know what that mob will do to them.
Do you want them to build that bestial guillotine in Naples?
But in London they will say it wasn't the Royal Family you went back for.
- Be careful what you say!
- I will say it!
They will say it was for Lady Hamilton.
Let them say it. Let them say what they wish! l will not see those I love and owe loyalty to left alone.
Back to Naples
I understand, sir.
In the face of such open disobedience,
I must ask your Lordships for a clear decision.
Where is Nelson now?
At Palermo, where he took the whole party after he got them away from Naples.
As much as I dislike discussing personalities and private matters,
I must say he does not behave in a manner befitting a British Admiral.
Hear, hear.
I quite agree with what you're saying.
Gentlemen.
Gentlemen.
Lord Nelson has some excuse for his disobedience.
How can there be an excuse for disobedience?
He did save the royal family of an allied nation from certain death at the hands of the mob.
He also saved the British Ambassador and his wife.
- What's the point of saving the husband?
Yes, you think it very funny.
The whole of England thinks it's funny.
The whole of Europe.
- But it's high time that...
- Steady, Keith. Steady.
No-one questions the seriousness of this matter.
Lord Nelson is a very gallant sailor.
But not even the greatest hero is strong enough to defeat the prejudices and conventions of society.
We must be tolerant of poor Nelson. lt'd be best to bring him home at once.
Let him say farewell to this charming little romance of his.
Let him forget the beautiful Emma.
- Oh, that's appalling.
- It's wonderful, magnificent.
- This time we have them at our mercy.
- That's the worst hand we've had.
I know, but we will bluff them. Smile, just smile.
Fortunately, they don't understand us.
- Possiamo cominciare, Signora?
- Qual è la posta?
- Il doppio.
- Il doppio.
- But we haven't a chance.
- We shall in a minute. Smile.
- The seven of diamonds.
- The ace of diamonds.
There, you see.
The queen of clubs.
- But that's mad...
- Treble the stakes! Triplichiamo la posta.
- But, darling...
- The king of spades.
The seven of diamonds.
And the ace of hearts.
E bene, signori, a mio parere.
- Molta fortunata, signora.
- Bravissimo, signora.
By gad, you're impudent. What would you have done if the bluff had failed?
I would have fainted and upset the table.
Now let us go.
We can't go. We must give them a chance to retrieve their losses.
Would they give you a chance? No, come along.
I'll order the carriage and we'll drive home by the sea. The air in here is unbearable.
Arrividerci, signori. Bon soir, monsieur.
In a minute.
Emma, there's a matter of some importance that I must speak to you about.
Yes, William.
Ten days ago, a dispatch came from the Admiralty, instructing Nelson in very definite terms to report in London at once.
What is all this to do with me?
Well, if Nelson ignores this final order, there can be only one result.
Dismissal from the Navy and the end of his career. ls it worth it, Emma?
His future is in your hands, you know that.
Very well. If we must go back, we must go back.
I'll tell him tonight.
When do you wish us to leave?
We are not going to leave, Emma.
My instructions from the Admiralty say that Nelson is to return alone.
Oh, I understand.
The Admiralty is anxious to save him from me.
And what am I expected to do?
It will be convenient, my dear. The Turkish envoy has invited you to winter in Cairo.
Tell Nelson that you love Egypt and that you have accepted the invitation.
You can be wonderfully convincing when you try Emma
The moment you leave for Egypt he will have no alternative but to obey orders and return
I know I'm asking you to do a very difficult and painful duty.
Thank you, William.
Well, we both have our duty, haven't we?
Good luck with yours, my dear.
Well, I lost everything. I feel better for it.
What is the matter, my dear?
William has just been talking to me.
Telling me of the repeated dispatches from the Admiralty.
He also wanted me to put on a little performance for you.
Act One. Emma Hamilton expresses a sudden desire to see the Sphinx and the pyramids.
Act Two. Lord Nelson pleads,
Emma Hamilton remains adamant.
Act Three. Emma Hamilton departs for Egypt.
And Lord Nelson returns to London a sadder and wiser man.
Poor William, he was so serious about it all. I'm convinced he was only thinking of your career.
He'd been puzzling through all sorts of stories.
What hadn't occurred to him was the truth.
How silly. How utterly silly.
To think that we should need lies, you and l.
Oh, my darling.
What is the truth?
Should I have put on that comedy for you?
- It might have helped perhaps.
- Oh, no.
I cannot put it off any longer.
I must go back this time.
They want me to go alone.
Oh, of course, you must go.
And, of course, I must go to Egypt.
I don't want to be a burden to you, my darling.
My darling.
And, of course, I will enjoy seeing the pyramids and the Sphinx and the Nile.
Your Nile.
Oh, my darling.
Why do we always meet just to say goodbye?
? At home I left a lovely maiden
? With rosy cheeks and eyes of ocean blue
? And though my heart is sad and heavy laden
? To leave a lass I love so fond and true
What are those bells?
Have you forgotten what night this is?
The last of 1799.
Eight bells for the old year and eight for the new.
Happy New Year, darling. apby New Yea r
The dawn of a new century.
How strange it sounds.
What a century it's been.
Marlborough rode to war and Washington crossed the Delaware.
Louis XVl and Marie Antoinette.
The last of the Stuarts.
Peter The Great.
Voltaire.
Clive Of lndia.
Bonaparte.
Nelson.
Now I've kissed you through two centuries.
The beginning of a new life for me.
A life without you.
How beautiful was the old century.
When I was with you.
Emma, say that you could never leave me.
I can never leave you.
Say that you hate the blasted pyramids.
I hate the pyramids.
That you never want to see the Sphinx.
I never want to see the Sphinx.
We'll go back to London together.
I would have died if you'd left me here.
I am Lady Nelson.
Everything has been prepared for Your Ladyship.
Your rooms have been reserved by the Admiralty.
Thank you. Kindly show me to my rooms.
You will find our bed linen in the green trunk.
We prefer our own sheets.
- Very good, Your Ladyship.
- Breakfast precisely at 6:45.
India tea with lemon, one four-minute egg, two slices of thinly buttered toast.
I shall instruct the head waiter, Your Ladyship.
I dislike waiters in the rooms.
Would you arrange for a chambermaid?
As you wish...
Here, here. Go and drink a health to Lord Nelson my son.
Thank you, sir. I will and be proud to.
I am deeply honoured to have you with us on this great occasion, sir.
You are the guest of the British Admiralty,
Mr Nelson.
Good, then charge up a glass of port to the British Admiralty.
And let's have it right away.
Anything for you, my dear?
No, thank you. One small glass of light port for Mr Nelson and a warming pan for his bed.
Very good, Your Ladyship.
Wonderful! Wonderful! Lap of luxury.
No morning service and no chickens to feed.
Let's have breakfast in bed with two eggs, eh?
I've arranged everything, Father.
It's unwise to break good habits even in London.
You must remember Dr Ponsonby's words of advice.
Dr Ponsonby's advice.
Did Dr Ponsonby's son ever sink the French fleet?
- We're going to enjoy ourselves.
Your Ladyship, Lord Spencer is here and wishes to be received.
Very well.
Good morning, Lady Nelson.
The Admiralty appreciates your prompt response to its request.
I hope your accommodation is comfortable.
Quite, Lord Spencer, thank you.
- Pray, be seated.
- Thank you.
I assume that the Admiralty desires my presence to discuss the arrangements for my husband's reception. When does he arrive?
He's already arrived, Lady Nelson.
What?
It was Lord Nelson's special wish that his arrival should not be made public.
Did he include his wife in the term ''public''?
I don't recall the exact phraseology of the letter.
However, the Admiralty thought it advisable to accede to his request.
So he arrived at Great Yarmouth yesterday
I was not aware that Great Yarmouth is a naval port.
He travelled on the mail packet from Hamburg. lsn't that peculiar?
I should have supposed that a victorious admiral would arrive on his flagship.
Flagship? Oh, er...
It is not customary as you know for ladies to travel on battleships
See.
I wondered why the Admiralty had decided not to give my husband an official reception.
Now I understand and fully agree.
The programme for Lord Nelson's stay in London will be a simple one.
He should be able to leave for his home in Norfolk the day after tomorrow, even tomorrow night.
Do I understand that my husband will be forced to resign from the Navy?
Oh, no, no, no, no, Lady Nelson.
Hardly as drastic as that.
Extended leave for the benefit of his health will be suggested.
A matter of different words.
That's what you mean, isn't it? I'm glad.
You were quite right to spare the people of London.
The indignity of feting a hero who treats with contempt the most sacred rules of life.
May I say a personal word?
Try to be forgiving, Lady Nelson.
Only the weaknesses of the great are glaring.
I prefer the official view.
Goodbye, Lady Nelson.
Did you hear it? Cheering.
Listen. He's coming! He's coming!
Excuse me, sir. May I have your permission to hang a flag in the balcony?
Hang two flags, three flags, everything you've got.
Come on! Come on!
Hang the coat of arms between the flags!
Most opportune, sir. We saved the coat of arms from King George's jubilee!
Do you realise that these are my private rooms, sir?
Forgive me, Your Ladyship.
I had no idea this would happen.
The Admiralty told me that Lord Nelson's return would be private and without demonstration.
We never dreamed that the public would take the matter so completely in hand.
Has the government no control over this vulgar demonstration?
No, ma'am. The vulgar demonstration has control over the government.
MR NELSON: Bravo for Nelson! Bravo!
I must get back to the Admiralty, hang out all the flags we've got.
Listen, church bells.
Victory bells for my son.
Here they are!
Mr Nelson, my name is Hamilton.
Oh, my son's good friend.
He's often told me about you in his letters.
You're to be congratulated.
You have a great son.
Lady Nelson, I am delighted to meet you.
We had the privilege of joining your husband in his triumphant procession across Europe.
It was overwhelming and quite exhausting,
I'm afraid, for an old man.
My wife was in her element. She swallows a triumph like a penguin swallows a herring.
Did you have a good crossing, Sir William?
Quite rough, I'm afraid. Everyone was seasick and I was sicker than them all.
I made the mistake of trying to ward it off with pills.
- Oh dear dear
- What's the good of trying to fight the elements?
It's far more sensible, is it not, Lady Nelson, and so much easier to accept their victory whether those elements be around us or within us
I hope we shall have the pleasure of seeing your frequently, Lady Nelson.
He's coming! Nelson! Nelson!
Bravo for Nelson!
My boy!
How proud your mother would be if she could see you this day.
How have you been all these years, Father?
First rate. Fanny's taken great care of me.
I'm sure she has.
There is so much I have to be grateful to you for.
How are you, my dear?
I'm very well.
And how is Burnham Thorpe?
They've named a street after us.
What an honour.
Are these Lord Nelson's rooms?
Yes milady
It was magnificent, stupendous.
Wasn't it wonderful, William?
They're wild with enthusiasm.
Come to the balcony! Quickly Quickly!
For he's a jolly good fellow
? For he's a jolly good fellow
? For he's a jolly good fellow
? And so say all of us
? And so say all of us
? And so say all of us
? For he's a jolly good fellow
? And so say all of us
? And so say all of us
? And so say all of us
? For he's a jolly good fellow
Lady Nelson...
? And so say all of us
I am Emma Hamilton.
Hooray! Hip hip hooray!
Hip hip hooray!
Hip hip hooray!
Hip hip hooray!
Well, it's been a great day.
A wonderful day.
And next month, it's the choirboys' picnic at Burnham Thorpe.
Why do you laugh?
Are the places of country people of so small account?
A little more wholesome I think than the mass hysteria we've seen today
Well, call it what you like.
It was a beautiful reception.
You wouldn't believe the fuss they made about him at Naples after the battle
Whoo! Such crowds. Thousands of Italians.
All smelling of different sorts of onions.
Onions?
Yes, they always do. I don't know why, it comes out more when they get excited.
There was such a crowd round the embassy the milkman couldn't get in
So His Lordship had to go without his macaroni pudding.
LADY NELSON: His what?
My Emma put him on macaroni pudding to fatten him up after the battle.
Did you ever meet the King of Naples,
Mrs Nelson?
He was a one for macaroni.
He'd take pieces that length, open his gullet and drop it in.
Proper caution, he was
He came to see Emma with the Queen one day and he pinched my...
He pinched me.
He pinched you? The King?
Well, you see, he's a foreigner, poor King.
He got so jealous when they cheered
His Lordship because he loved it so himself.
If you shouted outside his palace, he'd come in and out like a cuckoo clock.
Emma... Emma, who was that other king we met on the way home?
You know,
I get so mixed up with all these monarchs.
Oh, dear, Emma. Will you excuse me, dear?
I've been up since five.
Of course, Mother, darling. Good night.
Oh, it's good to be back in England again to hear the Bow Bells and the muffin men and the soot falling down your chimney.
Well Sir William how goes the world these days?
Can we hope for a little peace now?
Well, I don't know.
What was that medicine you gave my husband?
It's some stuff my mother makes.
It's very good for coughs and colds.
I think I would prefer my husband to see a doctor.
This weather is dreadful for him.
It was so different in Italy.
The sun always seemed to shine there.
Yes, it's never very agreeable in the Thames Valley during the winter.
It's only for a few days. Once he's back in Norfolk, he'll be a different man.
Do you think you will be leaving London so soon?
Certainly. There's nothing to detain us.
Directly he's made his report to the Admiralty and taken his seat in the House of Lords, we shall be free to go.
Why not?
Oh...of course, yes.
What are your plans, Lady Hamilton?
I suppose you'll be going abroad again shortly?
We don't really know.
Life is so very uncertain, isn't it?
I haven't found it so.
Will you excuse me, Lady Hamilton?
It's been a very exhausting day.
- Of course. Good night.
- Good night.
Emma.
We've been living in a dream.
And now we are faced with the truth, how ugly it is.
How terribly ugly.
But we've still got the courage to face it.
What's the good of being courageous if you're trapped?
If you know you are wrong and there's no way out.
I'll go to her and talk to her. Tonight. At once.
And you must talk to William.
They must understand
- Divorce?
- There is no other way
No, m y ove
That might be well enough for other people, but not for you.
You are not an ordinary man and you cannot behave like a Mr Jones or a Mr Thompson.
I wish I were a Mr Thompson.
Now, for the first time,
I begin to understand what William meant.
What we're doing is so dreadfully wrong.
Of course, I should have realised it before.
And because it is wrong, it cannot bring happiness.
Those streets we came along today.
They're the very same streets I walked through when I was a kitchen maid looking for work, but, today, they were the scene of your triumph, the triumph of our greatest man coming to his home.
They have made you the symbol of all that is most precious to them.
Whatever you do will be their guide and example.
You will not speak to your wife and I shall not speak to William.
I'm cold!
I'm freezing. I'm frightened!
Emma! Somebody will hear you.
Ssh, Emma!
Dear, Emma, ssh!
Is this better?
Lowered voices? Stolen meetings?
Darkness, suspicion, lies, more lies?
Is this what has become of it?
All that beauty and light and glory?
Good night, my dearest love.
Good night.
I, my lords, have, in different countries, seen much of the miseries of war.
I am, therefore, in my innermost soul...
..a man of peace.
Yet I would not, for the sake of any peace, however fortunate, consent to sacrifice one jot of England's honour.
Hitherto there has been nothing greater known on the continent than the faith the untainted honour the generous public sympathies the high diplomatic influence, the commerce, the grandeur, the irresistible power, the unconquerable valour of the British nation.
He's nervous.
Look. Look at his hand. He's trembling.
It's nerve-racking for any man to come into the House of Lords for the first time.
It will be more nerve-racking for the poor man when he goes out.
Why?
There is that Hamilton woman. peace or war no interest
And, don't look now, his wife. and as the nation was pleased with the sincere spirit of peace
It will be a thrilling moment when he goes into the vestibule.
I can hardly wait to see which one he goes to first.
Her?
Or her?
Here he comes.
My dear, were you comfortable up there?
Sufficiently, Horatio. Sufficiently.
- Did you hear my speech?
- For the most part.
You have a way of overemphasising, which is rather embarrassing.
- Oh.
- It was quite interesting.
Lady Keith.
Lady Spencer.
Lady Hamilton.
WOMAN: Why, what's the matter?
GENTLEMAN: Stand back please! Give her air!
- What was that?
- It's Lady Hamilton!
- Stand back please!
Wait, Frances, please.
- Will you fetch a doctor?
- Immediately.
Make way, please
- What's happened?
- I told her not to come.
She's not been feeling well all day.
N SO N W here s the doctor?
But why should she faint?
My dear, it's natural to women of all classes.
Drive on!
Well?
Frances, how could you drive away like that, without making the slightest effort to help?
Did you expect me to take her into my carriage, just because she selects the House of Lords for her melodrama?
When people have been kind to me and generous, don't ignore them when they're ill.
- Even in the House of Lords.
- Generous? Ha ha!
It is well known that what success
I may have achieved has been largely due to the help I have received from the Hamiltons.
- Why are you so ungrateful?
- Why are you so blind?
Don't you see what that woman is after?
It's the oldest story in the world, the most sordid and the most contemptible.
Find a public hero and there you'll find, as sure as fate, a woman parasite.
Don't you realise that all she wants is to flutter about in your glory, to use you for her own ambition and conceit?
Oh, I know, she helped you, she encouraged you.
Why, it was part of her plan to play upon your vanity.
She's capable of declaring you the father of her child.
- Frances, control yourself!
- Why not?
Even that accusation stirs some men's vanities.
Silence!
Oh, yes, everyone says she's a wonderful actress.
She is brilliant, to have hidden her sweet secret for so long.
The other day, you remarked upon the new fashions, all these frills and folds.
She invented them and all society followed.
Wonderful to lead society into helping her through a predicament.
You fool! Don't you realise everything she does is calculated and cold-blooded?
She faints in the House of Lords, a perfect place.
Do you suppose she'd have wasted time in fainting in her own bedroom?
You poor silly man!
Poor and silly?
Yes, that is what I am without her.
I'm a peer of England because of her.
And because of her, I'm Lady Nelson.
Lady Nelson? Ha!
What an honour!
They point after my coach, point up at my windows, point at me in the streets.
There's a coarse joke about me in the taverns.
A foul song about me on the Limehouse barges.
Lady Nelson!
How funny!
How pitiful!
And how proud I might have been.
I'm sorry, Frances.
Sorry?
Is that all you have to give me?
Yes. That is all.
Very well.
I shall take that as your answer and now you shall have mine.
I shall go away, but I shall never drag the name of Nelson through the divorce court.
As long as I live, I shall be your wife.
Goodbye.
Horatio, call her back.
I implore you, call her back.
You mustn't let her go like this.
I couldn't help hearing what you said, Horatio.
Please, Father, try to understand. do, m y boy, do
I know I'm a silly old man, a humble country parson, and I don't know the world, except the little people who come to me with their little troubles, but even those little people sometimes have to fight in the depths of their soul, the same temptations as you, the great of the world.
And, when they have to choose between right and wrong,
I give them the same advice as I give to you now.
Even if it forces all three of us to live in misery for the rest of our lives?
Even so.
That is something I cannot do, Father.
Then I shall go with her, Horatio.
What s the name off the child?
Horatia Thompson.
Her father's name?
Horatio Thompson.
- Profession?
- Sailor.
Where is he now?
At sea.
- Emily!
- Mother, darling!
- Are you well?
- Yes. How's the baby?
I wish you could see her. She's an angel.
Not at all like a child of two months.
She's like a little princess.
I wish you could see the way she receives her bottle and then indicates the meal is over.
- You'd adore her.
- What does she weigh now?
9lb 4oz, before her second bottle.
- The news, isn't it splendid?
- What news?
- Haven't you heard?
- I haven't been out
He's done it again. He's beaten the Danes.
It's a glorious victory!
Nelson was in the front line of battle, ahead of the main fleet.
His commander in chief saw the enemy outnumbered us by more than two to one.
He sent off a signal to Nelson telling him to give up and withdraw.
Do you know what Nelson did?
When the signal was pointed out to him, he put a telescope to his blind eye, said, ''I'm darned if I can see it'', went on fighting and won.
There, you see, everything comes in handy, if you know how to use it, even a blind eye!
How's William, Mother?
I have some news, too, Emma, but not so good as yours.
All his treasures, pictures, everything, he's waited for them to come from Naples for so long.
Now, we know for certain they all went down in the ship that was lost in the storm.
Oh, poor William. That was his whole life.
Gavin, that picture, there, the Van Dyck.
It's crooked, don't you see?
I've told you about it twice already.
- Why don't you put it straight?
- Yes, Sir William.
- Here, sir?
- Yes.
That's good.
Good, Gavin.
It's good to have my pictures around me once more and my statues.
But they... They need more light, more room.
We must rearrange them, Gavin.
Gavin...
I'll dine with Miss Hart tonight.
Alone.
At eight o'clock.
Look after yourself.
Talk to Sir William before it's too late.
Or the house itseIf will go to his nephew instead of to his wife.
His wife?
Why, I have never been his wife, Mother.
Let Charles have the money.
I don't want it and I don't deserve it.
But, my darling, if things stay as they are, you won't have a penny when he dies.
You'll be poor!
I shall be rich.
I've got my child, his child.
I think that means more than all the money in the world.
- Can I see Sir William now, Gavin?
- I don't think it's advisable, milady.
He's sleeping, very peacefully.
Gentlemen, the victor of Copenhagen!
Bravo, Nelson!
Lord Nelson, your decisive defeat of the Danes has made it possible for the British Government to negotiate this honourable and, I must say, unexpected peace with France.
We all believe, with the deepest conviction, that we shall have, at last, peace.
ALL: Hear, hear!
Lord Spencer, gentlemen...
..you are celebrating a peace with Napoleon Bonaparte.
''Peace'' is a very beautiful word, as long as the impulse of peace is behind it, but you will never make peace with Napoleon.
He doesn't mean peace, today.
He just wants to gain a little time...
..to rearm himseIf at sea and make new alliances with Italy and Spain, all to one purpose.
To destroy our empire!
Years ago, I said the same thing at Naples.
I begged them, entreated them, not to give way, but they wouldn't listen to me and paid the price.
That was a little kingdom, miles away in the Mediterranean.
But now it is England, our own land.
Napoleon can never be master of the world until he has smashed us up and, believe me, gentlemen, he means to be master of the world!
You cannot make peace with dictators.
You have to destroy them, wipe them out!
Gentlemen, I implore you, speak to the Prime Minister before it is too late!
Do not ratify this peace!
We, er, appreciate all you say.
Well, thank you, gentlemen.
I feIt it my duty to tell you of these things.
I'm not a statesman, of course.
I'm no diplomat.
I must leave it in your hands.
- Gentlemen.
- Good day, Lord Nelson.
Going to your, er, home in Norfolk, Nelson?
I don't... I don't think so.
My wife tells me she saw Lady Nelson at Bath, recently.
Yes. She's very well.
She gives her time to social work.
Ah. And er...shall you go to Venice?
Er... Why Venice?
Oh, something I heard the other day.
A little party to some musical festival,
Lady Hamilton and a few English friends.
Where did you hear this?
It was that little musical chap, who came over to Covent Garden to conduct.
I heard him say something about
Lady Hamilton going back with him
Oh, well...
I daresay I've got it all mixed up.
Well, it's good to see you home again.
Why, your lordship!
Good afternoon, Mrs Cadogan.
Sit down, please.
Everything is in such a mess.
Why this sudden move from Piccadilly to Nero's Hotel?
Well, you see, everything was so dull and dismal since William died.
Emma couldn't stand it any longer. see
Where is she now?
She went out quite early.
With the little foreign musical gentleman.
They're... They're driving in the park.
Oh.
May wat?
Yes please.
Look at the flowers. Aren't they pretty?
So nice for a young widow.
- Yes.
- Horatio
I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?
Oh, no.
Emma, dear. I just came in by chance.
Your mother has been telling me why you moved from Piccadilly.
I think you're quite right.
It was so very gloomy there.
I haven't seen a great deal of you since I've been back, Emma.
- You know what it's like. There's so much to do.
- How is the child?
I've been meaning every day this week to go and see her.
But it's so difficult. It takes almost a whole day.
Emma, let us drive out and see her this afternoon.
Oh, yes.
Lord Nelson, whom the whole of London knows, calling on little Horatia Thompson. whose father no-one has as yet seen.
My dear, what a titbit for Lady Spencer's next dinner party.
Come in.
Thank you.
My dear, I know you're very busy and I don't want to intrude upon your affairs, but there are things that I don't quite understand since I came back and to be honest I don't quite like
What things do you mean?
Three times this week I've tried to see you and each time you've had appointments with people whom I don't know.
We had no secrets at one time.
Even in our letters.
You surely do not ask to see all my letters.
Certainly I do not ask to see them, my dear.
If you want to hide them from me.
You're jealous!
Why do you make fun of me?
Fun? I've never been so happy in all my life.
You're splendid when you're jealous.
You must promise me to be jealous always, please.
We were talking about some letters, weren't we?
Horatio, if there are certain letters I would sooner keep to myself, won't you trust me?
What are those letters?
Very well.
Read them.
I'm sorry.
Forgive me.
- I'll see you later.
-No, Horatio, don't go.
You know what will happen if you leave them unopened.
We shall never quite understand each other again.
They're quite short, and to the point.
Bills, bills, and more bills.
Threats, summonses and lawsuits.
I'm up to my neck in them - drowned in them.
Why do you think I left Piccadilly?
My dear, they threw me out.
And why do you think
I haven't seen our child for two weeks?
Because I owe Mrs Gibson
15 guineas for the rent.
Do you think I like going out with that little man from Venice?
I hate the sight of him
But I have to do it because he's promised me a contract at his opera house.
Yes, I'm going back to work.
I've done it before and I can do it again.
I don't really mind.
You see, Horatio,
William didn't leave me a farthing.
- Why wasn't I told?
- Why should you be told?
These are my troubles, not yours.
I've never asked anyone for money and I never shall.
Indeed?
Then are you out of your senses?
Now, you listen to me, and don't answer back!
How dare you keep those bills from me.
Aren't your worries my worries?
Everything I have is yours.
Everything!
You're going to have a home of your own.
And there is going to be no sorrow and no trouble ever again.
Emma.
Dear Emma.
Mm, that's the best drop of rum I've tasted since the old days.
We don't get much excuse to open a bottle lately. You should come oftener.
It warms the cockles of your heart.
Captain Hardy, how nice to see you again.
Why didn't you tell us you were coming?
Well, to tell you the truth, I just happened to be passing and thought I'd come and see you.
Will you stay to luncheon?
Oh, thank you, my lady.
Mother, darling, tell the coachman we leave at two. I want the child here before dark.
Yes, dear, I'll tell him.
He's in the garden. You can see his work of art in the summerhouse.
I don't want to disturb him, my lady.
I know he likes his peace and quiet.
Just because he won't see St Vincent and Keith when they write him pompous letters?
Oh, no, Hardy, you're different.
You're an old friend. Come along.
No, to tell you the truth, Lady Hamilton,
I didn't come to see him.
I came to see you.
Me?
Yes.
There's no chance of our being overheard, is there?
No, but what is the mystery?
Well, do you ever read the newspapers down here?
Not unless we can help it.
We're not particularly interested in the court news.
Nor the gossip, the scandal.
You may have missed what happened.
Bonaparte's made himseIf Emperor of France.
Yes, we saw that.
What is his next move?
His next move will be the invasion of England.
Oh, ridiculous!
So it may sound, my lady.
That's what we all thought when we first heard it.
But it's true. This peace was no good.
It'll break any day now.
This self-styled Emperor has made an alliance with Spain.
He's raked together a new fleet from goodness knows where.
And he's building transports and barges as fast as he can turn them out.
From Boulogne to Brest, every single Channel port is chock-full of them.
He's got a whole army behind him waiting to embark.
A few weeks from now, all he'll need is a fair wind.
And all you'll need... will be Nelson.
Yes, that's it, my lady.
- Is that all?
- That's all, my lady.
You see...
Well...
Nelson's the only man who can save us.
Now, listen to me, Hardy,
I have helped the Navy whenever I could, but not this time, Hardy, not this time.
Let them find some other man to take command.
Keith or Parker or St Vincent himself. Not him!
Don't they understand, Hardy?
He's given so much.
His arm, his sight, his health.
He needs rest and he must have it.
For the first time in his life he's found peace of mind and happiness.
And I'm going to see that he keeps it.
If they want me to use my influence, I will.
All my influence to persuade him that this new war is none of his business!
That's... all I have to say.
Of course, there's nothing to prevent you from talking it over with him personally at luncheon.
Will you stay?
No, thank you, my lady.
I think perhaps l'd better get back.
Goodbye, Hardy.
Oh, come along. I thought you were dressing.
What have you been doing?
We'll never get there if you don't look sharp.
Besides, I'm hungry.
Starving.
I don't think we'll go today, Horatio.
It will save two trips if we pick her up tomorrow, after you've been to the Admiralty.
The Admiralty?
Hardy has been here. They sent him.
They need you, dear, badly.
This war is coming, as you always said it would.
And there's no-one else.
Did you tell Hardy I would go?
Yes.
It's a matter of course, dear, isn't it?
It'll be freezing tonight on the high roads over the downs.
Yes,
I think I'll take the little rug I use in my study.
- Oh, yes, I know, I'll get it.
- I'll get it, Mother.
He thought he wouldn't need the rug.
He'll never come back, Mother.
? Cheer up, my lads,'tis to glory we steer
? To add something new to this wonderful year
? To honour we call you as free men not slaves
? For who are so free as the sons of the waves?
? Hearts of oak are our ships
? Jolly tars are our men
? We always are ready
? Steady, boys, steady
? We'll fight and we'll conquer again and again
Mr Pasco,
I will now amuse the fleet with a signal.
Mr Pasco,
I wish to say to the fleet...
..''England confides that every man will do his duty.''
Be quick. I've one more to follow for close action.
If you will permit me to substitute
''expects'' for ''confides'', it will be sooner completed.
That will do. Make it directly.
Those Frenchmen have sharpshooters up in the rigging, sir.
I know. Why do you tell me?
Do you think it's wise to wear all those decorations? They make a nice target.
- I won them in battle, didn't l?
- Yes, sir, but...
Then I shall wear them in battle.
England...
Expects...
That...
Every...
Man...
Will...
Do...
His...
Duty.
? Come cheer up, my lads,'tis to glory we sail

? Hearts of oak are our ships

We'll be on them in half an hour, sir.
Mon capitaine, la flotte enemie est nord-ouest et bâbord.
Mon amiral, la flotte enemie est nord-ouest et bâbord.
Prèparez pour l'attaque.
- They're getting pretty close now, sir.
-Not yet.
Starboard broadside fire as you bear.
Voilà l'Amiral!
Sir!
They've... done for me, at last.
You're not badly hurt, are you, sir?
My backbone... shot through.
- I'll carry you to Dr Beattie.
- You stay on deck. Come to me when you can.
Cover my face... these decorations.
No time for the men to see me like this.
Mr Beattie...
... I have no feeling... below my breast.
No lower.
I know what that means, Mr Beattie.
My spine is broken.
My lord...unhappily for our country, nothing...can be done for you.
Poor Emma.
What will become of her?
Was that cheering?
They're cheering in all our ships, my lord.
The French line has broken.
Why doesn't Hardy come?
- He must be killed.
- He's on deck, sir. He can't leave.
They're cheering again.
The French flagship has surrendered, sir.
Good.
Why don't they bring Hardy to me?
He sends a message, sir.
We're against the Redoubtable.
When we have beaten her, he will come.
- How goes it, Hardy?
- Fourteen of them are ours, sir.
Not enough.
Twenty. Twenty.
Don't throw me overboard, Hardy.
No, sir.
You know what to do.
Let my dear Lady Hamilton have my hair...
..and all things belonging to me.
You mustn't die, sir. You mustn't die!
It's all over now, Hardy.
All over now.
Sir!
Sir! It's eighteen now sir
Eighteen - a great victory.
Thank God.
I have done my duty.
Kiss me...Hardy.
I am the resurrection and the life, sayeth the Lord.
He that believeth in me though he were dead, yet shall he live;
And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.
It's all right, Anna, I'll draw them myself.
Thank you.
My lady.
- Do you come from Portsmouth, Hardy?
-No, Spithead, Lady Hamilton.
I came on the St George, she's our fastest ship.
Captain Blackwood went ahead to London with the news.
What is the news, Hardy?
It was a great victory.
It was the greatest we've ever known.
That's wonderful.
It was nine days ago... we engaged them off Cape Trafalgar the combined fleets of France and Spain
They've been destroyed
The oceans are free once more and England is safe from invasion
The first cannon was fired a little after twelve
Within one hour five French ships-of-the-line had struck their flags
His plan was magnificent
He swung our fleet from line of battle into two spearheads, that broke the enemy line into three separate parts.
Then... about one-thirty
I was walking with him on the upper deck
The fighting was at its height
The French flagship the Redoubtable came through the smoke and we fought alongside one another he was so confident.
We'd just...turned to go...back to the...
By sunset everything was over
But he he lived to know he'd won England's greatest victory
His His last thoughts were with you my lady
That you should be cared for
- And then?
- Then what?
What happened after?
There is no then.
There is no after.

JUNE 1940
The shadow of the conquering German armies, covered western Europe.
The self-styled master race, was riding high.
DUNKlRK
Calais
Now Adolph Hitler stood, just as Napoleon had stood, more than 100 years before.
And looked across the English Channel to the one fighting obstacle that stood...
..between him and world domination.
The chalk cliffs of Britain rose sheer and white, out of the choppy waters.
And beyond, a little island, smaller than the state of Wyoming.
Crush that island, and its stubborn people and the way was open for world conquest.
The fall ofAustria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Denmark,
Norway,
..Holland Belgium, France had given him more than
100 million slaves,
..to work for him or starve.
The preliminaries were over, it was time for the main event. The battle of Britain.
Berlin
Where Napoleon failed, I shall succeed. I shall land on the shores of Britain."Adolph Hitler
Hitler and his Generals feverishly drafted their plans for the conquest of Britain.
Every detail must be anticipated.A slip now, might wreck the timetable of world conquest.
Six weeks of final preparation went into those plans.
Six weeks to determine the history of a thousand years.
The thing was fool-proof. See for yourselves how simple the whole operation was meant to be. Look.
GERMAN PLAN FOR lNV ASlON OF ENGLAND
PHASE l
Knock out the Royal Air Force and its bases.
Get control of the air and sea lanes across the channel.
Follow the blitz plan that wiped out the low countries, Poland and France.
Destroy communication and transport lines.
Above all, get command of the air.
PHASE ll
Pulverize the coast line with dive bombers.
Drop parachute troops to take over the air fields and establish beach heads.
Drop parachute troops to take over the air fields and establish beach heads.
PHASE lll
Actual invasion.
Pour the German Panzer divisions across, in high speed barges,
..under an umbrella protecting fighter planes. then send spear-heads of armed might, to divide, surround, destroy all opposition.
That's all there was to it.
Conquer Britain. Force the surrender of the British fleet. then with the combined sea-power of Germany,
Britain, ltaly, France and Japan,
..he could control the seas, and tell us whereto head in.
The torch of freedom flickered low.
On the invasion coasts, more than 100fully equipped
German divisions were singing the Nazi theme song,
We are sailing against England.", as they waited the word from Hitler.
Here, for weeks, all the supplies and weapons of the
Nazi war machine...
..had been turned toward Britain.
The jaws of the Nazi whale, were set to swallow Jona.
And what about Jona?. How was he doing?.
Well, Britain also had an army
But it was an army dragged from sea at Dunkirk.
An army without weapons. These had been left behind on the roads of France.
Tanks, guns,
..motorized equipment,
..all abandoned to save the one priceless item...
.. men!
In all of Britain, there was not enough equipment for one modern division.
Only one tank for every thousand square miles of territory.
Only one machine gun, for every 1 500 miles of beach.
Britain had a navy too, but it was scattered all over the globe,
..guarding vital food and supply lines.
And the British knew it would be suicidal to use their fleet in the narrow waters ofThe English Channel,
..with the German air force in control of the air.
Britain also had an air force.
An air force outnumbered 10 to 1 by the enemy
..both in men and machines.
There was Britain herself.
The people of Britain.
The people who would be terrorized and forced to surrender.
They knew every man, woman and child, in uniform and out,
..would be Hitler's target, in the onslaught that could come at any moment.
They knew they had a job to do and not much time to do it in.
The young, the not so young and the old.
The clerk, the butcher, the farmer, the member of
Parliament,
..they formed the civilian army,
Britain's Home guard.
They started from scratch.
Experience, equipment, supplies...
..all were scarce.
Only one shell to fire at each practice.
The women of Britain refused to be left out.
We're in this too."
We'll put up the barrage balloons."
Man the air cat guns."
We'll run railroads and get the trains through on time."
Ferry the planes."
Carry the dispatches."
Drive the ambulances and run the buses."
And we'll see our male are fed, and don't go hungry."
Others worked.
They worked full time.
Overtime.
Double time.
Forty hours a week, fifty, sixty, seventy.
Hours meant nothing.
Fatigue meant nothing.
Until the government forced them to cut down hours, because over-fatigue was...
..hurting production.
And when they weren't working the men patrolled the moors for parachutes...
..blocked the roads...
.. rehearsed invasion defenses.
For something had happened here the Germans could never understand.
In a democracy, it is not the Government that makes war...
..it is the people.
To lead them, the people had chosen Winston
Churchill as their Prime Minister.
To lead them, the people had chosen Winston
Churchill as their Prime Minister.
And he spoke the word in every British heart, when he said:
We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be."
We shall fight in landing grounds, in fields, in streets, and on the hills."
We shall never surrender."
This was Britain in its darkest hour.
The people knew they were in for the worse the Nazi mind could invent, yet...
..they didn't panic or run away
They patrolled and waited.
They drilled and waited.
They worked and waited.
Waited for the terror they knew was coming.
Then it came!
That is the sound that became part of life, for every man, woman and child in Britain.
August 8th, 1940 and the battle for Britain is on.
Thirty enemy aircraft over the channel, flying due west."
Here comes the Luftwaffe.
In dozen of flights, hundreds of planes.
Bombers, fighters, dive-bombers, across that 21 miles of channel.
That eight short minutes of water.
Their first tactics were to bomb convoys in the channel.
Convoys loaded with food and munitions, bounded for the great port of London.
German fighters waited overhead for the defending planes of the RoyalAir Force, the RAF to appear.
They didn't have long to wait.
The RAF came, facing of 6, 8, 10 to 1,
..and dove in, shouting the old hunting cry: "Tallyho!"
Phase one of the Nazi plan, called for the RAF to be knocked out of the air...
..but the men of the RAF, hadn't read the Nazi plan.
In the first 4days, the RAF knocked
182 German planes out of the sky
For the next week the Germans attacked the coast cities from the Thames River to Weymouth.
Mr. Getty, take cover!"
Spitfire!"
And Hitler paid off with 180 more planes.
Then the Luftwaffe battered the great towns of Southampton,
..Plymouth....
..trying for a knockout, before the flow of supplies from overseas reached port.
The ports took a terrible pounding, but they couldn't be knocked out.
Cargos went on being unloaded, with the protection of the RAF overhead.
Battling the Spitfires and Hurricanes in the air wasn't panning out.
So Göring switched his main attacks to the fighter airfields, Dover,
Deal, Bucking.
Maybe he could destroy the planes on the ground.
He bombed the air fields, and the fields were hit...
..but the planes were saved.
For Britain, unlike Poland and the low countries, didn't make the mistake of bunching its planes on the runways.
The planes of the RAF were scattered and hidden.
Only a few on any one field, and those in the far corners.
The Spitfires still went up to meet the enemy
In the first 10 days of the Battle of Britain, Göring launched 26 major attacks to get command of the air
And lost 697 aircraft. The British lost 153.
And 60 British pilots bailed out.
Valuable trained men were saved, and ready to fight again,
..but the crews to Göring's planes, were lost to him forever.
The pace was too hot.
Something was going haywire.
The Nazis had to call "timeout".
On a 2000 mile front, from Norway to France,
..the whole Nazi blitz program was being stalled, because the RAF was still in the air.
The long-range German guns were getting hot,
..from throwing shells across the channel.
In public, Hitler assured the Germans,
Mr. Churchill tells his people that England will win...
..but I tell you victory will belong to Germany"
But in private, he sent for Göring, the boss of the Luftwaffe, and put him on the hot seat.
Göring was told to do something and do it quick.
So on August 30th, he ordered all out attacks on inland air drones and industrial centers.
Maybe he could knock out the RAF on the assembly line.
And he adopted new tactics too.
More fighters and fewer bombers, or maybe he just had fewer bombers to send.
Anyway, those he did send were well protected.
Fighters above at high altitudes.
Fighters on both sides.
Fighters in the front and in the rear Fighters weaving in and out of the bomber formations.
Fighters in the front and in the rear Fighters weaving in and out of the bomber formations.
Britain, winner of the first round, was ready
With higher morale and sharper defense.
Improved listening posts were set up all along the coast.
And warned of the enemy's approach, before he left the continent.
A quick flash from the control station to the fighter station.
And pilots were on their way to meet the enemy while he was still over the channel.
Day after day, out of sight, an almost out of sound of the watchers on the cliffs.
Four, five and six miles above, the battles raged over the Dover area.
The Dover area became known as Hell's Corner.
By sheer weigh of numbers, the enemy again and again broke through the coastal defenses.
And reached inland to the air drone.
Aircraft plants.
Munitions, factories and machine shops.
Hello, gunfire in the southeast. Right."
But the workers kept on working.
And the RAF kept on flying.
These few men with wings, alone in the sky
..behind their motors and machine guns,
..were shooting down more than the Luftwaffe.
They were smashing the whole Nazi plan of world conquest.
Any claims Johnny??'
109 destroyed, yes."
-"Oh, good show!"
How did you get on sir??'
-"Oh, I had a wonderful party, thanks."
Are you all right?. Have you hit any of the batters??'
-"Yes, I got a Messerschmitt 109."
Between August 24th and September 5,
35 major attacks were launched.
They cost the Germans 562 planes, while the British lost only 219 planes and...
..and saved 132 pilots.
Invasion plans were going completely haywire.
Berchtesgaden
The Nazis were blind with rage.
The German mind has never understood why free people fight on against overwhelming odds.
Hitler knew he was now superior in every weapon, expect the weapon of spirit.
So he told Göring, break that spirit, crush the people, crush the spirit of democratic life itself.
Invasion now, would have to wait.
The Nazis would avoid the RAF and smash the great city of London,
..into the rubble heap they had made of Warsaw and Rotterdam.
Could London take it?. Even the people themselves didn't know the answer.
The defenses they trusted in, were London's hastily assembled anti-aircraft.
The Ack-Ack guns. The balloon barrages which kept the raiders at high altitude.
The Royal Air force, now down to its last reserves.
And the plain down-right guts of people.
They sent more children out of the city
Tightened air-raid precautions.
Stationed more aero plane spotters.
Rehearsed firefighters.
Moved into bomb shelters.
They blacked out their city, and carried on.
The first blow, aimed to crush the British spirit,
..came on September 7th.
Control room speaking."
-"Customers and staff, will now take cover...
.. in the basement. Please do not run, keep moving."
Down the stairs or you can use the escalator."
Third floor clear. Second floor clear.
First floor, clear."
That day when 375 German planes came roaring up theThames River,
The battle of Britain, became the Battle of London.
The German's broke through the charge of Spitfires and Hurricanes that went out to meet them.
Gone was any pretence of aiming at military objectives.
This was just savage destruction.
Bombs fell alike on the homes of the east-end poor,
..and the Mayfair rich.
On shops.
Hospitals.
Churches.
For 28 days the Nazis were to drop everything in the book on the city of London.
Tons upon tons of high explosives.
Delayed action bombs had exploded days later
Torpedo that had sheered away whole buildings.
And underneath the war in the air the war of the man in the street went on.
He learned to exist with very little food.
He forgot what it meant to have a night's sleep.
Spending most of his time underground, in the damp, dark and cold.
Good-evening folks."
-"You're in early tonight."
Well, I quite a sight, aren't l??'
I think that will be all right now."
-"Yes, that's grand."
How are we going to get you up there??'
-"Get the young man to lift you up."
Brady!"
-"Hello."
Come give this young lady a lift up."
-"Right you are."
The air-raid wardens stayed at their posts.
Doctors and nurses worked on steadily, as the bombs crashed around them.
Rescue squads labored night and day
Hey Warden, I found one."
Is she dead??'
-"Quite dead."
Firemen said, nuts to the bombs, and battled to put out the fires.
This was life in the blitz.
Against all the rules of Nazi warfare,
Britain was refusing to crumple up.
Across the Channel, the enraged Göring took personal command of the operations.
And on September 15, he sent the Luftwaffe into one of its greatest attacks.
Five hundred German bombers and Messerschmitt fighters, roared over the English coast.
Bomass calling. Planes heard three miles southwest."
Hostile planes approaching from southwest."
The British met the challenge by throwing in everything they had.
An historic 3 dimensional battle took place.
Inside an area 60 miles long, 38 broad and from 5 to 6 miles high.
Two hundred individual dog fights took place within the first 30 minutes of the raid.
Right on our own doorstep. Oh, what is that??'
Centre calling mountain one."
-"Thank you centre, we'll keep an eye on them."
Hostile formation to the south."
Some of the German bombers broke through
London's defenses.
And reached the centre of the city
Doughy?. Where are you??'
Blimey, I thought they'd got you."
-"Who me, nah. I had my fingers crossed."
140 destroyed, 70 probable.
Dear Ministry Communicant,
..the biggest bag yet. One hundred and eightyfive enemy aircraft shot down.
End of message."
Of the 500 German planes that came over that day
..more than 1/3were shot down.
In the 28 days of terror, from September 7th to October 5,
..the Nazis dropped 50 million pounds of bombs on the city.
Killed 7000 helpless civilians,
..and wounded 10,000 more.
Bombs fell on Buckingham Palace.
Westminster Abbey.
The Houses of Parliament.
Fleet Street, the centre of the news.
St. Paul's Cathedral.
Bombs blasting the historic past, out of the lives of Englishmen.
But in these 28 days, the Nazis lost
900 planes and their crews.
The more were sent over, the more were shot down.
The British Spitfire proved to be one of the deadliest weapons ever put into the hands of man.
If this kept up, pretty soon, no more Luftwafe.
The frantic Nazis had to pull a new one.
They did. On October 6, they changed to night attacks.
Maybe that way they could avoid those deadly
Spitfires and Hurricanes.
Maybe that way they could crush the stubborn British spirit.
Never mind control of the air. Never mind Phase one,
Phase two and Phase three.
Never mind control of the air. Never mind Phase one,
Phase two and Phase three.
Now concentrate on bombing the people themselves into submission.
And make them cry for mercy.
Hostile raid sir."
The RAF wasn't much help at night.This was just
German bombs against British guts.
Hello Jerry."
-"They sound happy enough down there tonight."
The great docks of London, were left roaring infernos.
Homes were destroyed by incineration.
Business blocks were a flame.
And still the people of London took it.
Night after night they burrowed underground.
And morning after morning they dug themselves out of the wreckage.
Good-morning."
-"Good-morning."
Would you like to sit down??'
-"Thanks."
Morning ladies. Sleep well??'
-"Fine thanks."
What about the one that came down about 2??'
-"l didn't hear it."
Don't you think you ought to go away from this for a bit??'
Of course not. It will take more than this to get me out of my home."
Now go on, you've got to get to work."
-"Okay."
The Battle of London, was the battle of the people of the century
In spite of bombs, and fire and death,
They got to their desk and workbenches, to spend another 10-12 hours working...
..working...
..working.
The British spirit was stronger than ever.
And the RAF was flying higher than ever
Not only higher, but further
S.I.O.?. Operations for the night."
GP1 562"
EP781 Ten aircraft."
You'll find a decent photograph of the submarine yard there."
There was a very good one taken the other night."
That's it. There's the submarine yards."
All right chaps. This is your target for the night.The submarine and ship-building yards at Bremen."
It's a vitally important target.
And it's got to be hit hard."
In the midst of this life and death struggle,
The British found strength not only to defend but to counter-attack with what...
..Q-bombers they could get together
Hello air-gunner, can you hear me??'
"Coming okay skipper."
Hello operator. Everything okay??'
-"Well it seems to be all here sir."
Stand by, I'm going in on a glide."
Steady!"
I got a bulls eye with the last one."
Here was the RAF giving it back.
Hitler cried: Night gangsters. For this crime
I will exact at thousand fold revenge.
November 14, 1940.
All the available German night-bombers, were put into the air.
A thousand fold revenge was Coventry.
On November 14, a million pounds of bombs were dropped on the city
Coventry was smashed as flat as Warsaw and Rotterdam.
The people of Coventry, dug their loved-ones out of the blasted ruins...
..a them to their last resting place, in a common grave.
Hitler could kill them, but damn if he could lick them.
They went back to their lathes and machines.
For they knew the machine-bench was as deadly a weapon as a rifle.
And in their hearts, was a grim determination, that this enemy must be destroyed.
That the day was coming when they would strike back.
And how they would strike back!
Christmas 1940.
Christmas. Season of Peace on Earth,
Good Will toward men, was the ironed...
..quiet before Hitlers great burst of rage against a people who couldn't be licked.
PLANES!"
He couldn't bomb them into submission, so he would burn them to ashes.
Millions of fire-bombs, rained down on the great city of London.
In a matter of minutes, more than 15 hundred diferent sections of the city burst into roaring flames.
Flames that swiftly merged into the greatest fire in recorded history.
In the midst of all the fire and destruction,
..vital water mains were shattered. Water pressure was almost entirely cut off.
Heroes of the night, were men of the London Fire
Brigade, who stretched temporary hose lines out to the centre ofThames River,
..struggling through mud and slime.
For the Nazis had carefully picked the night on which theThames River
..had one of the lowest ebb tides on record.
And while London burned above them, the people of the city held on.
Chin up and thumbs up.
They knew this was the peoples' war.
And they were the people.
And the people that couldn't be panicked couldn't be beaten.
In the months to come, the British were to suffer many such bombings and burnings.
But a nation that calls on cold courage, when hot courage runs thin,
..may die, but it can't be defeated.
The Battle of Britain was won, but not by Hitler.
Hitler had lost the battle. He had lost
2375 German planes and their crews.
For the first time, it was the Germans who ate the bitter dirt of defeat.
Gone was the legend of their invincibility
For a solid year, the Nazis struck Britain with all their might.
They leveled thousands upon thousands of homes.
And damaged millions of others.They killed more than 40thousand men, women and children.
And seriously wounded 50thousand more.
But not one single Nazi soldier, set foot on British soil.
But Hitler couldn't stop. In our next film, we will show how he had to turn to the east again.
Why did the Nazis lose the Battle of Britain?.
First, because a regimented people, met an equally determined free people.
And the free people made them quit cold.
We've been bombed, dive-bombed, high-level bombed,
..machine gunned, been through two invasion scares...
..and the last lot we had, we had the house down about our ears."
But we're still sticking it and we're going to stick it."
Second, because this was a new kind of war.
And the RAF were the men who could fight it.
These are the men who belonged to what
Hitler called,
..those weak, soft democracies.
The British did more than save their country
..they won for the world a year of precious time.
It was not only for the people of Britain, but for the people of the world that Winston Churchill spoke, when he said: "Never in the field of human conflict, was so much owed by so many."
Victory of the democracies can only be complete with the utter defeat of the war machines...
..of Germany and Japan.

Mr. Parks.
Mr. Edison hasn't even left the house yet, sir.
- Have you any idea what's keeping him?
- No, sir, I haven't.
You'd better phone him and ask.
- Yes, sir.
- Wait.
- You'd better go there yourself. And hurry.
- Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Do you know a fountain pen has always been a mystery to me?
Can I put that in our school paper, Mr. Edison?
Nancy, please, that's a foolish question.
- Now, Mr. Edison!
- Nancy, is your name Nancy?
Yes, sir, Nancy Gray.
Nancy. That's a pretty name.
- I've always liked the name of Nancy.
- It was your mother's name, wasn't it?
Hm-hmm.
Yes, that's why I like it.
Now, Mr. Edison, what is your formula for success?
We know his formula for success, don't you remember?
Success is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration, isn't that right, Mr. Edison?
Hm-hmm, hm-hmm.
Of course that 1% inspiration is very important, you know?
You have to have it, you can't invent it.
- You can't learn it in school either.
- What's that?
- You can't learn it in school either.
- No.
No, I guess you can't.
Although I was never in school long enough to find out.
You weren't? Who taught you then?
- A school marm.
- But you said you didn't go to school.
- Nancy did, my mother.
- Oh.
What do you think was the greatest invention?
The printing press, the electric light, the radio?
- The greatest invention?
- Yes, sir.
- A blade of grass.
- But that isn't an invention, Mr. Edison.
Oh, yes it is, oh, yes.
That's nature's invention.
Did you ever stop to think what makes it grow, makes it green?
No, sir.
Mr. Edison, what would you say is the most valuable thing in the world?
Oh, that's easy.
- Time.
- Time?
Because all the money in the world won't buy one minute of it.
Mr. Edison.
- Mr. Edison!
- Hm?
Are you ready to leave for the banquet?
Oh, the banquet.
Oh, Paul, I'm sorry. I forgot all about that. I never carry a watch.
He never carries a watch!
That's important.
- Yeah, human interest stuff.
- Goodbye, Nancy. Good luck.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mr. Edison, thank you.
You're welcome, you're welcome.
You never can tell about a banquet.
It is fitting that we celebrate the golden jubilee of light...
...in this replica of old
Independence Hall.
For I hold with Mr. Henry Ford, who built it here, that Thomas Edison, through his work, has framed a new kind of declaration of independence.
He has declared through his work...
...and with a force greater than that of any man now living, the freedom of the human mind.
The peoples of the world whom he has served are witnesses to this truth, and we are here to do him honor in their name.
But there was a time when he had no witnesses.
He had to make his way slowly, against odds, of ignorance, doubt, prejudice and greed.
After his early years in Port Huron,
Mr. Edison worked as a telegrapher.
Quietly studying the use of a mysterious new power.
Electricity.
In 1869, he left the west and went to Boston, where his first invention, a vote recorder, was rejected.
He then came down to New York City.
Thank you.
- Who's that fellow?
- I don't know.
Hey, you.
You there.
Hey, what are you doing there?
Come out of there.
- Why didn't you stop?
- Stop what?
You heard me, I shouted three times.
- I'm sorry, I'm a little hard of hearing.
- What's that you're holding?
Come on, open it up.
Oh, books.
- What's going on here anyway?
- I guess maybe I was a little hasty.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I'm looking for a telegraph operator named Cavatt, Bunt Cavatt.
He told me I'd find him in the gold indicator building.
- Is your name Tom Edison?
- Yes, sir.
I'm Bunt Cavatt's uncle.
- Els is my name.
- How do you do, Mr. Els?
Come on down.
- Down from Boston?
- Yes, yes, sir.
- Ever been in New York before?
- No.
Aim to stay long?
I hope so, Bunt promised to get me a job.
- Oh, Bunt!
- Yeah?
Here's Tom Edison.
You old lightning slinger, how are you?
Well, how's the old tramp?
Finer and stronger.
Well, what are you doing, going or coming?
I'm going.
Well, you can't do that,
I just got here.
- This is Uncle Ben's suggestion.
- I told him he could stay if he'd work.
Yeah, but look what he wants me to work with.
I'm telegrapher. A man has to draw the line somewhere.
- How about that job you promised me?
- Huh? Oh...
Oh, you don't want to work in New
York, Tom.
This town is no good for you. The tall buildings crush the spirit and torment soul.
Oh, no, not gonna torment my soul.
I always wanted to come to New York.
Now I'm here I'm gonna stay here.
- Is somebody dead? What is that smell?
- Oh, that's, that's, er...
- That's that.
- What?
- That's your vote recorder.
- Gosh, I didn't feel it was that bad.
Well, that's not the reason Congress rejected it.
They just don't want their votes recorded.
But I made a big success out of it anyway.
- It's marvelous for aging whisky.
- Aging whisky?
Smells like you're aging eggs.
You just run the electricity up through it and jolt it up a bit.
In 10 minutes you got
20-year-old whisky.
Well, that settles that. That's my first and my last invention.
Oh, you don't mean that, Tom.
Anyway, it'll teach me a lesson not to invent things that people don't want.
Never mind it.
Let's you and me hit the road again.
Not me, I'm going to stay in New York.
Aw, you're not ready to settle down yet.
You're the best telegrapher operator in the country.
Almost. You can get a job anywhere.
Besides, look at the fun we'll have.
Never mind the fun. I've been a tramp operator long enough.
And so have you. Now if you take my advice, you stay here too.
Well, I might as well...
Here, here, the place for you is San Francisco.
San Francisco needs you.
- And here's a ticket as far as Hoboken.
- Thanks for the lift across the river.
Well, goodbye, Uncle Ben. If anything happens to me, you'll be sorry.
Uh, how about a little cash?
Help yourself.
- I'll take the five.
- You sure you won't need that?
Oh, no, it's soft money. It's very suiting.
Now, goodbye, Tom.
I'll leave you with Uncle Ben. You can step right into my shoes.
You'll look very good on the end of that broom.
Uncle Ben, if you can stand that whisky, it's yours.
Goodbye gentlemen, it's a beautiful world and we will meet again to enjoy it.
- My pal. And he runs away from me.
- No, not from you, from that broom.
Well, now how about it, Mr. Els?
How about me picking up from where Bunt left off?
You can help with the cleaning if you want.
Room and board. You understand, temporarily, until you get a job.
That's fine. Thanks very much, thank you.
And it'll be alright if I do a couple of experiments here while I'm working...
...you know, on my own time?
Yes, if you're careful.
Come on now, we've got work to do.
You understand that thing?
- I should, I made it.
- Well turn it off. It's getting me down.
# Genevieve, sweet Genevieve #
# The sun may come... #
This is Mr. Taggart's office.
Oh, it's where all the big deals come off, huh?
- I'm tired, let's drop off awhile and eat.
- Alright!
- What's this contrivance?
- What's that?
- What is this thing?
- Oh, that's a master transmitter.
We get quotations direct from the floor of the Gold Exchange...
...then we send it out from that machine there to the brokers' offices.
- Ain't it a wonder?
- It's a wonder that it works.
I'd like Mr. Taggart sometime.
- Mr. Taggart? Meet him? To talk to?
- Sure, why not?
That's good! Meet Mr. Taggart.
Come on, let's eat.
Well, how do you do, Mr. Taggart?
Now look what you made me do.
Mr. Taggart, it's a pleasure to meet you, sir!
A real, unadulterated pleasure.
Now, Mr. Taggart, I'm going to be very brief...
...because I know you haven't much time and neither have I.
Have a cigar, Mr. Taggart.
Don't mind if I do.
And sit down, please.
By all means, sit down, Mr. Taggart.
Now, Mr. Taggart, you've got money and I've got ideas.
Together we should make a great team.
Sounds good, young man.
How much do you need?
Well, I'll make it light on yourself,
Mr. Taggart.
Well, money's pretty tight right now.
What do you say to two million dollars?
- You took the words right out of my mouth.
- Shall I wrap it up or send it?
Stop your fooling, stop your fooling.
I guess I'd better go and lay down awhile.
I ain't feeling so good.
'Bout this time of night
I get all tuckered out.
Why don't you take a little nap, Mr. Ells?
I'll clean up the office.
- Help yourself to the lunch.
- Oh, no, that's yours.
I ain't hungry. I keep worrying about Bunt.
I guess I won't get a wink of sleep tonight.
Mr. Els, you shouldn't try to do two things at once.
If you're gonna sleep, sleep.
If you're gonna worry, why, stay awake and make a good job of it.
Listen to this, Mr. Els. From Faraday's experiments with electricity.
The object of my search was for a way to convert magnetism into electricity.
When I broke the current, I observed a spark leap between the bits of charcoal.
Lo, I beheld the embryo of electric light.
But I have rather been desirous of discovering...
...new facts concerning magneto electric induction...
...that are exalting the force of those already obtained, being assured that the latter would find their full development hereafter.
Hereafter?
That's now.
Hey! Hey!
- Did you see that spark?
- Why do you think I jumped?
It works, just like it said it would in the book.
You'll burn the building down first thing you know.
No, I won't, Mr. Els.
This is an experiment in electricity.
Electricity? That stuff's dangerous.
Stop fooling with it down here.
How am I going to find out about it unless I fool with it?
You told me I could experiment down here.
Oh, I'll lose my job.
You want to get me fired?
Oh, no, Mr. Els.
I'd rather walk the streets hungry and homeless than have that happen.
You've been too nice to me.
I'll just go my way.
No, wait a minute, wait a minute, I didn't say anything about you having to go away.
I'd rather go away than have you worry all the time.
Oh, I'll be alright, but just go easy, that's all.
Thanks, thanks. You see, Mr. Els, if that thing works, everybody's going to be able to use it all over the world.
What is it?
It's a new kind of light, something that's never been seen before.
Are you going to make me mad again?
No sir. Of course I have to get the money to experiment.
Well, why don't you invent money?
I'm going to get the money from Mr. Taggart.
I'm going to sell Taggart the idea of a new stock ticker.
That'll give me the money to carry on the experiment with light.
You ought to know by this time you can't see Mr. Taggart.
You can see anybody if you just try long enough.
- Yes, what is it?
- You know what it is.
Same thing it was yesterday and the day before that and the day before that.
I want to see Mr. Taggart.
It ought to be clear to you that he's too busy to see you.
You go in and tell Mr. Taggart
I'd like to see him.
Shut that door, I don't want to be disturbed.
Beg your pardon, sir, Sorry, but a person named Edison is anxious to see you.
Well, I can't see any person named Edison today.
It's very important, Mr. Taggart.
I'll see him next Christmas.
And shut that door.
- Next Christmas, Mr. Edison.
- Hm?
Next Christmas, Mr. Edison.
Is it alright if I wait here?
- It's down half a point.
- One more drop and I'll sell out.
It's a shaky market.
Down another half.
- What time does Mr. Taggart go to dinner?
- He doesn't go. It's brought to him.
What's the matter?
- Hey, what's the matter?
- Give us the quotation!
- It's stopped!
- It'll ruin us!
What does it say?
- It's busted.
- Well do something. Get Taggart!
Yes, sir.
Get away now.
Go downstairs and see the battery connections.
- The trouble's up here. I can fix it.
- Get away!
It's very simple. It's very easy.
Alright, fix it, fix it!
But be quick!
How long is it gonna take?
It's just the contact spring that fell down between the gears.
- What's your name?
- Edison.
- Can you keep that indicator running?
- Yes.
You're hired.
I'll give you $300 a month.
- How much?
- Isn't that enough?
I'm afraid if I got that much money for this job I'd never have the courage to quit.
What do you want?
I want just five minutes of your time.
- Come in to my office.
- Yes sir.
General Powell.
Good afternoon.
That was quite a flurry.
This is the man who fixed the indicator.
General Powell, Mr., uh...
Edison.
General Powell, president of Western Union?
- Well, you're another man I want to see.
- I have no objection.
You see, we own that gold indicator.
Merry Christmas.
Thank you, sir.
What kind of a stock ticker have you in mind?
A ticker that will give you quotations not only on gold...
...but on every stock in the market.
You really think you can do that?
Yes, sir, I think I can, if you'll only give me a chance.
- Certainly good cigar, you know?
- What sort of a chance do you want?
- A chance to experiment.
- Young man, we can't afford to experiment.
Not with green electrical workers.
We've no guarantee that these theories of yours are workable.
Well, most electricity is theory yet.
That's the trouble. Beyond the point, what good is electricity anyway?
What point is a newborn baby?
- Mr. Edison, you're simply wasting my time.
- Well, in that case, I won't waste mine.
Sit down, both of you.
It's not going to do anybody any good if we get all excited...
...and start jumping to our feet.
Sit down.
You ought to use more imagination, Taggart.
And you ought to use more patience... and tact.
Mr. Edison, I'm very much interested in your idea for a stock ticker.
If you want to work, I'll give an opportunity in our new workshop.
And whatever you bring to me that's new and practical, I'll buy.
That's great, General.
All I want is a place to work, a few tools and some men to help me.
You'll have all that.
Mr. Taggart's secretary will give you a letter to our foreman in Newark.
- Thank you, sir.
- Not at all.
Thank you.
Oh!
I beg your pardon, I didn't see you.
That's all right.
You didn't hurt yourself?
No. Why are these things always so much easier to open?
Beg your pardon?
Why are these things always so much easier to open?
- Maybe I can help you.
- Thank you.
- You work here?
- Yes, upstairs.
- I'm starting in downstairs today.
- What do you do?
- I'm an inventor.
- Oh, well, really!
- You see, I don't invent umbrellas.
- Anyone could tell that.
My word!
- Mr. Johnson?
- Yes.
I'm Tom Edison.
- General Paul told me that...
- The letter is self-explanatory.
This way.
You can work here. Naturally, anything you want is at your disposal.
Thank you, Mr. Johnson.
We like to have the home addresses of all our men.
Where are you staying?
Right here.
I mean, where are you sleeping?
Well, for the present I'll have to sleep here.
Very well.
General Powell says you are to draw some money on payday.
That's very nice of the general.
When is payday?
Next Saturday.
- My name is Michael Simon.
- Oh, how do you do? Mine's Edison.
- And that is Mr. Ashton.
- How are you?
How do you do?
What sort of work are you going to do here, Mr. Edison?
Well, the first thing I'm going to do is fix an umbrella.
Excuse me, miss.
Here's your umbrella.
Oh, it's you.
You fixed it!
It looks alright again.
Thank you.
- Thank you very much.
- Don't mention it.
You handle those keys very well.
- That's my job, Mr. um...
- Edison, Tom Edison.
Mine's Mary Stillwell.
- Dinner time, I'm hungry.
- Beg your pardon?
I'm hungry.
Rushed to work this morning without any breakfast.
So did I.
And I got a lot of work to do yet before I can eat.
- Goodbye, Miss Stillwell.
- Goodbye, Mr. Edison.
Yes, sir.
How much is apple pie and a glass of milk?
- 10 cents.
- I'll have that.
Oh, hello!
Well, it seems like we'll have to have dinner together.
That's fine, fine, uh...
You see, when I went back downstairs
I found out that I, uh...
- Uh, won't you sit down?
- Thank you.
I'll have the regular 35-cent dinner, please.
You eat very little for a big man.
Yes, yes, don't I?
- Oh, no! Please.
- Oh, it's a pleasure, Miss Stilwell.
Thank you.
This check is for 45 cents. Could you trust me for a day or two?
No.
Maybe I could come back a little later to pay you.
No.
Mr. Edison.
- You dropped something.
- Oh! Thank you, thank you.
Mr. Funny Fellow, huh?
I guess I didn't hear that dollar when it dropped.
I heard something, and looked and there it was.
Sure is nice to have somebody like you around to pick things up for me.
- Do get out of the rain.
- Yes, ma'am.
You've earned your share of this umbrella.
When you get it fixed again be sure and bring it back to me.
- Well, here's some money for you.
- Oh, thank you.
Mr. Simon, here's the money I owe you,
I'm very much obliged.
Oh, it is a pleasure, I'm sure.
- Thanks, Bob.
- Oh, any time.
- I'm ready for some men now.
- How many of these machines...
- ...are you going to make?
- Just one.
You've got drawings here for a dozen.
- If one works, I'm lucky.
- Alright, I'll get you some men.
Mr. Johnson, if it's all the same to you,
I'd like to pick them out myself.
Of course.
I'm afraid Mr. Simon isn't very original.
I guess he's right.
Alright.
The spring's too strong.
Maybe you can make a better one.
Say, a fellow can tell a bad egg without being able to lay one.
Sorry, I guess you're right.
Graham, Lundstrom, Bigelow, report to Mr. Edison.
Boys, I'd like to get some models made of each one of these sketches.
- Would you like to try that one?
- Sure.
I think that'll suit you.
And here's one that'll keep a tomcat home nights.
- The tougher the better.
- Go to it, boys.
Would you like to try this one?
Thank you very much. I prefer to work for the company.
Alright. Well, I guess I'll go after this one myself.
Simon, I'm sorry, but it looks like
I'll have to lay you off.
Have you got another job?
No.
Look, I'm sure you can do this.
- I'll try my best, Mr. Edison.
- Sure, I know you will.
Do you mind working a little while tonight until I come back?
- I've got something very important to do.
- No, I don't.
Thanks.
What are you doing?
I'm asking the young lady to have supper with me.
- What does she say?
- Says she'd be delighted. Want to try?
It's been a wonderful evening.
Such a dinner, the concert...
- I didn't know you liked music.
- I do, if it's simple enough.
Oh, look, isn't that a lovely sofa?
If could tell better if I could see it better.
Wait until they can light their windows with electric lamps
Then you'd really see something.
- What is electricity?
- Hm?
I've been working around it for over a year and don't even know what it is.
Nobody does.
An old Scotch telegrapher told me once it was like a dachshund dog, long enough to stretch from
Edinburgh to London.
You'd pull his tail in Edinburgh and he barks in London.
Nobody knows what goes through the dog or over the wire.
You know, there's electricity in people too.
I know. Sometimes my hair gets so full of it I can't comb it.
Really? I'd never think so looking at it now.
Maybe you're a human electric battery.
Let's experiment.
That's what you are, a human electric battery.
Did I shock you?
No, not exactly, let me have your hand.
Oh, there's a lot of electricity in you.
I can feel it going up my arm.
It sort of tingles.
- Wouldn't we better be going?
- Wait, this is a scientific experiment.
Now, you know the theory of electricity... is that it always travels in one direction, see, from positive to negative.
Positive, negative.
We're wrong somewhere.
- You're the positive one, is that it?
- Very positive.
- Then should that make me negative?
- I hope not, are you?
Somebody's always interfering with science.
And does the machine really work?
Yes, it did, at 4 in the morning when I went home.
I left it still working. And after ten weeks of it, too. I'll show you.
Boys, come on. I'll show you.
Now watch.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Mr. Edison.
Mr. Edison.
I don't know, it doesn't work.
- It doesn't work?
- No.
Gosh, that's funny.
It should work.
- Congratulations, Tom, it's a good job.
- That's fine, Tom.
- I didn't believe we could do it.
- What do you mean we?
Mr. Edison, that's a very fine piece of work.
- Thanks. Hey, what time is it?
- Seven o'clock.
Oh, Gosh, I got to be in New York by nine.
- Oh, there's plenty of time.
- Somebody put my hat on for me, will you?
Sure!
- Here we go, boys.
Tom.
- Think they'll like it?
- Of course they'll like it.
How much do you think I ought to ask them for it?
What do you think it's worth?
I don't know. I'd like to get a couple thousand dollars for it.
Suppose you let them make an offer before you say anything.
That's a good idea.
You think you're nothing but wood, and metal and glass.
But you're not. You're dreams, and hard work and heart.
- You'd better not disappoint us.
- I'm glad you said us, Mary.
Good luck, Tom.
Oh, Tom!
There you are, General.
What do you think of it?
Why, you've done it.
Well, that's that!
Looks like it.
Would you be interested in taking over a plant to manufacture these tickers?
Oh, no, sir.
I'd like to sell it outright.
- I got some other things I want to do.
- What are some of these other things?
Well, I'll bring them around and show them to the General when it think they're right.
You see, I like the cigars I get here.
As a matter of fact, I'm now in association with the general so let's talk business.
I'm ready.
How much you want for this stock ticker?
Well, uh... I...
Suppose you make me an offer, General.
Whatever you think is fair.
How about $20,000?
- How much?
- I said $20,000.
Well, I... $20.000, I, uh...
Perhaps a fair price with world rights would be $30,000.
- Yes, $30,000.
- Well, I...
- Come, come, now. Let's make it $40,000.
World rights and everything,
I really think that's fair.
Yes, yes, General, I think that's fair.
Oh, General, before you make that out.
You advanced me some money, remember?
$215 in cash.
$106.23 in material, it comes to
Are you sure that's correct?
Yes sir. I'm sure.
All right.
We'll forget it.
Thank you, sir.
What are you going to do with all that money?
I'll tell you one thing I'm not going to do with it.
- I'm not going to buy any gas stock.
- Well, you might do worse.
I doubt it, Mr. Taggart.
Oh, here are patent papers, General.
They're yours now.
- And thank you, sir.
- Don't mention it. Goodbye.
One moment. Don't congratulate yourself too much.
You may be interested to know that we were prepared to go...
...as high as $60,000 for your invention.
- You were?
- We were.
It may interest you to know that I was prepared to sell it for $2,000.
Mr. Edison, what happened?
Hold your horses, boys, I'll tell you all about it later.
He sold it.
He says "will you marry me?".
She says, "Yes, Tom."
He says, "Come right down."
She says, "Right away".
- Congratulations!
- When is it going to be?
Mr. Edison, I'd like to work with you wherever you go.
Sure, sure...
Congratulations!
Well, what are you waiting for?
Well, what are we waiting for?
- Congratulations, Mr. Edison.
- A boy, too!
That's wonderful, Tom.
First a girl, now a boy.
Well, it had to be one or the other, don't you think?
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- Don't smoke cigars?
- Yes, but I'll save it for some day.
Here, here's one for Monday too.
Come on, there's one more for each here.
- Thank you again.
- Thank you, Tom.
Can't tell when this will ever happen again.
Maybe not for another year.
- More? Great shakes, what a capacity.
- Tom, it's nearly 9 o'clock.
- Is it?
- You're spoiling that child.
A man has a right to humor his youngest.
You've been late to the shop three mornings this week. What'll the men say?
Oh, they'll bear up on it, won't they?
Eh, won't they, Dash?
They'll bear up on it.
Come on, you'd better feed yourself now.
Daddy's got to go to work to make more money to buy more oatmeal.
Don't let me hold you.
It's been nice seeing you, Mr. Edison.
Do drop in when you're out this way again.
Come on, here you are.
Go to it.
- Goodbye, Dash. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Goodbye, honey, goodbye.
Goodbye, Tom. Say goodbye.
Say goodbye. There you go!
Well, Mr. Els!
Bunt, how are you?
- Is this 7 o'clock?
- Well, it was 7 o'clock.
Yeah, two hours ago. What kind of a businessman are you anyway?
- What have you been doing all this time?
- I've been feeding the baby.
There you are, Uncle Ben, the wheels of industry have to stand still while this man feeds his baby.
The wheels ain't standing still.
Listen to them.
He means his own wheels, huh, Bunt?
- It won't do any good, Bunt, I'm broke.
- You certainly are looking fine.
Broke?
- Are you really?
- Practically.
You can't be! You're an important businessman.
You got a laboratory, and a wife and children, and all kinds of stuff.
Besides, I only want five dollars.
Well, see if you can get ten and give me five of them. Come on.
Bunt, you could've at least let him finish saying hello.
There must be a leak in your business.
Something wrong with your bookkeeping.
There are the books.
Look them over.
- Books, I don't see any books.
- There they are. Both of them.
Bills I owe, bills owed me. Maybe it's the other way around, I don't know.
- But that's the whole thing in a nutshell.
- In a nutshell is right.
Come on upstairs and have a look.
- No wonder you're insolvent.
- Insolvent? Insolvent?
It sounds better than just being broke.
- Means the same thing, though, doesn't it?
- Yeah!
Well, you really have a nice place here, Tom.
Hm-hmm, not trying to show off.
Just wanted to prove to you, Bunt, that I spent the money.
- Good morning, Michael.
- Good morning, Tom.
Jack, any progress?
I've got it. I've got it sure.
All I need is a couple of days more.
That's fine, that's fine, I knew you'd get it. Stick to it, now.
That's wonderful. You know,
I never thought he'd get it.
- Has he got it?
- Sure, he said. You said...
He hasn't got a darn thing, but I like to hear him talk that way.
- Hey, Tom, here comes the sheriff.
- Uh-oh!
The sheriff in person.
I'd better evaporate.
Looking for Thomas Edison.
- Which one of you gentlemen is Tom Edison?
- Can I help you?
You certainly can, Mr. Edison,
There's a writ of replevin, Mr. Edison.
What does that mean?
A writ of replevin is an action to regain personal property illegally retained.
Such as what?
Such as this here machinery.
It ain't paid for.
Well, I wouldn't worry about that if I were you, sheriff.
I'll take care of all those things on the first of the month.
You ain't been taking care of them, that's what the trouble is.
Well, I might have overlooked a few little things.
- There's the writ of attachment, Mr. Edison.
- Oh, this is something different.
No, that's practically the same thing.
It gives you a week to pay up your bills...
...or this machinery all goes back to the factory.
I see, anything else?
Uh, yeah, here's a summons to come to court...
...and show cause why we shouldn't serve this here replevin.
This is no good now, you've already served the replevin.
No, no, look here, that writ of attachment nullifies all that.
- Oh, I see. Well, is that good?
- Well, it should... Doggone, how do I know?
Maybe you need a habeas-corpus.
You got everything else.
- Are you a drinking man?
- Well, sure, but I'm sober now.
Me too. Let's go someplace where you can buy me a drink.
Oh, yeah, that's an idea.
I never indulge in legal discussion without benefit of spirits.
Well, it's very thoughtful of you,
Mr. Edison
Say, Mr. Edison, I've got a little invention of my own.
- That's fine, boy or girl?
- Oh, no, I don't mean that.
Tom, Tom, the sheriff's gone.
I'm an ostrich.
Whenever I get in trouble I stick my head in there and hide.
Why am I laughing?
I am in trouble.
Yeah, that's right.
The sheriff said you got a week to pay the machinery company.
A week. A week.
It doesn't seem possible you can destroy in a week what's taken five years to build up.
It's a shame, you must have a mint of money wrapped up in that laboratory.
It's not the money wrapped up in the laboratory, the lives that are wrapped up in the laboratory.
It's come to mean everything that I ever set out to do.
The weekly paycheck for all my men.
It means home, shelter, clothing, food for lots of families.
I can't let a week destroy all of that.
Uncle Ben, I've got to do something.
And I'm open for suggestions.
- Are you fooling, Tom?
- I wish I was.
Nobody ever asked me for advice before.
Then you ought to have a lot of it stored up.
Well, it seems to me, if I was in your place... you being an inventor and all that, I'd...
Well, I'd invent something.
Oh, you mean just invent something quick, like uh... on the spur of the moment.
- That's right, the quicker the better.
- Anything you suggest in particular?
How about that light you was always talking about?
The one that was supposed to work by electricity, you remember?
Yes, I remember.
Well, it seems to me this is about as good a time as any to invent that.
Bunt's always talking about it.
It ain't often he talks sense but whenever he mentions that light, he sounds pretty reasonable.
No two ways about it, Tom, if you invent that,
Yes, if I could invent that.
- Uncle Ben, will you do something for me?
- Sure I will, Tom.
Will you tell my wife I won't be home for dinner?
And I may not be home for breakfast in the morning.
I'll gonna stay here and get busy on that light.
Tom!
- Hello, Mary.
- Tom, look at you.
- It would be a good thing if I could do it.
- Don't you think you ought to stop for a while?
- I can't, not now.
- But four days, Tom.
The children have actually stopped asking for you.
You've got to rest and eat.
I had some apple pie and milk a little while ago.
- That was yesterday.
- I've got work to do.
It can't be so important as all this.
Right now it's more important to me than anything in the world.
It isn't at all, Tom. Nothing is as important as health.
You're tearing yourself to pieces.
Come home with me.
Please.
- Leave me alone.
- Tom!
I mean it. Leave me alone.
I'm working and you're interrupting me.
Do I have to get your permission to do my job?
- You're not working, you're slaving.
- Alright, alright.
- Please leave me alone.
- All right, Tom!
Come in.
- Tom.
- Yes?
I don't understand these specifications.
This clay, what kind of clay is?
Pipe clay, ordinary pipe clay.
Wind the wire around it.
- Oh, yes, I see, I see.
- Michael.
Suppose this shop were to pass out of my hands...
...and become the property of someone else, would it make any difference?
Not to us, as long as you are here with us.
Supposing I took in General Powell as a partner.
And of course, Mr. Taggart.
Well...
If you have to...
Sounds very good.
That's all, Michael.
- Only a minute or two, please.
- I had no idea he was like that.
He's very, very ill.
- Hello Tom!
- Hello, General.
I'm glad you came.
I'd have come before this if I knew you were ill.
Why did you keep it a secret? Why didn't you let your friends know?
- Is everything alright?
- All fine.
- Sure?
- Sure. Everything smooth as silk.
Money piling in like corn in a crib.
I saw Taggart the other day.
He said something about helping you.
Helping me? I don't need any help.
Don't put too much faith in Taggart.
Now don't you worry about that,
General. You just hurry up and get well.
I'm doing my best, Tom.
I want to be around when you get that light.
- That light.
- You will be, General.
Hm, you think so.
So, it looks as though General Powell won't be up and around for quite a while and...
Well, the fact is I can't wait that long.
I've got to have the money right away.
Well, that's fine, Mr. Edison.
How much money do you want?
Well, with one thing and another it's quite a tidy sum.
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter at all.
General Powell thinks that you're a man with a future.
And any man the general believes in is alright with me.
Just name your figure.
What would you say to...
Hm-hmm, $50,000.
Suppose I let you have $100,000.
- That's right.
Well, I don't need that much, Mr. Taggart.
You may, you may.
You can't ever tell what's in the future.
For the present, I'm in the position to give you a check for $ 100,000 right now.
Why, that's wonderful, that's great!
I wish I could tell you how obliged I am.
Not at all, not at all.
I can go on experimenting for maybe
3 years now without any worry.
Naturally, if I let you have this money,
I should expect to assume some authority...
...in deciding the kind of work you do at Menlo Park.
Oh, you would.
Now, don't misunderstand me.
I simply want the right to...
...make sure that whatever you undertake to do is, uh... commercially profitable.
Sort of a little string on my money, if you don't mind.
But I do mind.
I'm an inventor, I can't be told what to do.
I've got to do the things I want to do.
I work with ideas, visionary things.
Nobody, not even I know how useful they're going to be or how profitable...
...till I've had a chance to work them out in my own way.
You're in a very bad spot to ask for your own way, Mr. Edison.
Yes, I am.
And you're willing to take advantage of it.
You want to put me on a chain.
Well now, you think it over.
No, that won't be necessary. I don't want your money at that price.
I'd prefer to hang on somehow until
General Powell is able to talk to me.
Thank you.
Mr. Edison, General Powell is dead.
Men, this might be a fine time for us all to sit down and have a good cry.
But we're not going to do that because it won't get us anywhere.
I know that we've been in tough spots before but, uh...
...we always seem to come up with something at the last minute, something that pulled us through.
Remember the chemical telegraph?
That was a windfall.
And the quadruplex and the electric pen?
Those things just sort of seemed to come along when we need them most.
But this time nothing has happened.
I don't know, maybe I've been expecting a miracle.
Anyway, it hasn't happened.
And I haven't any more time.
We're at the end of our rope.
And...
Boys, if you'll forgive me for putting it this way,
You're discharged.
Hold out for a few more days, Tom.
I know I'll work out this new telegraph thing.
Thanks, Jack, we can't hold out.
You've got to have money to live on, and so do I.
And we haven't any money.
Except, I've been able to scrape enough together to pay you off in full.
- Tom, Tom, may I say just a word?
- No.
The less said the better right now.
Men, I...
I want to thank you all for what you've done for me.
Pay them off, that's all.
Oh, there's Papa.
Yes. Now lie down.
Good night, sweetheart.
Hello, Tom.
Hello, Tom.
Hello, Mary.
I don't suppose it's any use to tell you I'm sorry, is it?
I don't know.
You might try.
Would it be alright if I tried tomorrow?
I'm dog tired.
- Tom, we've got something to settle.
- Not now, dear.
Yes, right now, Tom.
I want to know just how much this light means to you.
I want the truth.
Is there anything real to it or are you too stubborn to give it up?
- It's very real to me, Mary.
- But are you right about it?
Is everybody else in the world wrong?
Is there any chance, I don't care how small, of your ever finding it?
Can we discuss it in the morning, please, Mary?
Alright, Tom.
In the morning.
- Tom.
- Hm?
Well, I must have dropped off.
You let me sleep here all night?
Kind of tucked me in a little, didn't you?
I couldn't let you catch cold, Tom.
- We have to talk this out.
- My, my, my, I just had the funniest dream.
He was dreaming about winter.
It was so cold that the trees couldn't shake.
And daybreak froze fast just as it was trying to dawn.
Yes, ma'am, all creation was freezing.
The question was whether I was going to stay snug in bed or...
...get up and see what had happened.
Well, I got up, and the earth had frozen fast on its axis.
It couldn't turn around.
Everything was pitch dark, too.
The sun had got jammed in between two cakes of ice...
...and was working so hard to get loose that it froze in its own sweat.
Well, so I stared off cross-country to see what could be done and I met a bear.
I told him what had happened and he just naturally bounced up and down on the ice...
...so hard that the hot oil welled out all over him.
Then I picked Mr. Bear up and
I held him over the earth's axis...
...and I let the hot oil drip down.
Then I gave the earth's cog wheel a little kick backwards till I got the sun loose.
The earth gave a grunt and began to move, and the sun went up beautiful.
I lit my pipe by the light of its topknot.
Broke off a piece for myself.
Yes, ma'am, I walked home with sunlight in my pocket.
Oh, Tom, that's beautiful.
You go on with your work.
Go right ahead with your light.
Don't listen to anyone who tries to stop you.
Don't even listen to me if I talk against it.
Nothing in the world can happen to us as long as you can dream like that.
Well, Mary, maybe I didn't dream it exactly.
Maybe I got it mixed up with an old tall tale my mother would tell me.
No, I'd rather have it a dream.
Please, let it be a dream.
Alright, if you feel better that way.
Thank you.
I think you're a couple of laps ahead of me all the time.
I told you you needed a heavier spring.
How many times do I have to tell you...
...to make you understand?
Getting anywhere with repeating telegraph, Jack?
Not yet, but we'll get it.
Oh, Tom!
Here, here, don't monkey with that.
- Sorry, Tom.
- That's all right.
It certainly put up a loud holler.
Never heard it make that noise before.
It's certainly a keen noise. It seems to be coming from the disk.
Very odd.
Michael, I'll be in my office if anyone wants me. I've got some drawings to make.
Make this up as fast as you can.
What is it?
Is it something for the light?
No, I hope it's something that'll keep the sheriff away.
Hello, hello, hello.
Mary had a little lamb!
His fleece...
Hello, hello, hello.
Mary had a little lamb!
His fleece was white as snow.
And everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go.
Ha, ha, ha.
Hello, hello. hello.
Mary had a little lamb!
His fleece was white as snow.
And everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go.
Ha, ha, ha.
- Gee wiz!
- I say!
That's... that's a wonderful invention.
It's no invention. It's been there waiting for us all the time.
- You mean it was an accident?
- No, no, I don't think it was an accident.
Edison invents talking speaking.
Read all about the machine that talks!
Read all about it!
Bill told you, and Bill you owe.
You're certainly back on the right hook.
This talking machine is a gold mine.
Best pick in the corn stock load.
Look, Dash.
This is what I want to do. I want to get a record of your voice at its loudest
Come on now, huh?
Before your mother comes, be a good boy and give a big cry over this thing, will you, Dash?
Don't he cry enough as it is?
Go on, turn it. come on, Dash, cry, honey.
Look, Dash, Dash...
Dash, look, look.
Look, look, Dash.
Dash, will you please cry?
Dash...
Dash... look.
Well, I must say!
I wanted him to cry a little, but he would only laugh.
I should think he would, watching you two perform.
Come along, dear.
Tom, there's a crowd of newspapermen who want to see you.
What about? I'm busy now.
They want to know how far you've got with the electric light.
I wish I knew myself. Bunt, you go out and talk to them, will you?
Tell them I'll be glad to give them an interview... when I have something more definite about the light.
I see, you're still in the dark about the light.
You better duck.
No, no, don't rush. I'll answer your questions one at a time.
What is this about a light?
We heard he's working on a light..
Mr. Edison can't see anybody at present.
However, if there's anything
I can do for you.
Who are you?
I have been Mr. Edison's associate and confidant for many, many years.
Maybe you invented Edison, huh?
This is not a subject for levity, young man.
Mr. Edison and I were out west together as telegraph operators...
...and I may say, in all modesty, of course, that whatever Tom knows about telegraphy, I taught him.
I was always exceptional as an instructor.
To illustrate, I was once in the
Western Telegraph Station, so lonely... that I caught a big rattlesnake and brought him into my office for company.
And I named him Pete.
And gentlemen, in the long, cold, winter night hours...
...I taught Pete to sing out the
Morse Code with his rattles.
Well, sir, the snake got away, disappeared.
One day I chanced to be out bear-hunting... and I ran across a great big rattlesnake in the brush.
I brought my gun down on him and, would you believe it, he rattled out, "Stop, Bunt, don't shoot! It's me, Pete."
Just a minute, Mr... uh...
Cavatt.
James J. Cavatt
- Known over the world as Bunt.
- How do you do?
Mr. Cavatt, we didn't come here to listen to your snake stories, we came here to interview Mr. Edison.
Mr. Edison is shut up in his laboratory.
In fact, he's on the verge of a great discovery.
What is it? That's what we came to find out.
- Gentlemen, I'm not at liberty to say.
- Is it the electric light?
That's something you'll have to find out from Mr. Edison himself.
Why doesn't he tell us?
Firstly I don't believe he has a light and I don't think he ever will have.
- Oh, you don't, eh?
- No, I don't, eh.
And what's more, I think he hasn't the nerve to come out here and tell us.
He's hiding inside there behind you.
Why, you little pipsqueak, he's inside there alright because he has got the light.
- You mean he's actually discovered it?
- Yes.
- He's got it now?
- Yes.
Why hasn't he announced it?
One thing at a time. He just finished with the talking machine.
You can't let these big inventions pile up on the public.
- Thank you, Mr. Cavatt.
- Come on, these will make the headlines.
Pipsqueak.
I guess I gave him an earfull.
I sure did.
Ordinarily I'm a reticent fellow.
But he made me so mad.
You know I didn't have the light.
I'm miles away from it.
I never thought anybody'd believe me.
Everybody who reads the paper will believe it.
Everybody except the men of science.
They'll skin me alive.
Well, I guess maybe I'd better make myself scarce for a while.
If I had the money, I'd blow.
Can I take $20, Tom?
Here's the ten I owe you.
Like to keep even, don't you?
Well, take care of yourself.
Sure.
I'm awful sorry about that little blunder I made.
Why don't you tell them it's my fault?
Blame it on me.
No, it's alright, Bunt, it's alright.
As a matter of fact I'm kind of glad it happened.
Now I've got to get the light.
Taggart, the gas stocks are going down another point.
Gentlemen, if you please, make yourselves easy. There isn't any light.
- How do you know?
- It's my business to know.
There's no electric light and there never will be.
It's as impossible as perpetual motion.
- Then we ought to expose this man.
- I shan't say a word against him.
I don't have to. He's hung himself.
He's made a statement that isn't true and never will be true.
In the field of science that sort of thing is suicide.
That's right. By George, he's ruined himself.
Talk of an electric light is sheer nonsense.
Edison's claims are as extravagant as a fairy tale.
He knows or should know that it is impossible as perpetual motion.
I say to you in all sincerity that these statements about an electric light...
...are without any scientific foundation.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Edison refuses to demonstrate his mysterious electric light.
We can easily assume why he refuses.
Because there's no such light.
It burned out again.
Well, that won't work.
- We'll have to try something else.
- But what?
We've tried dozens of metals.
Tin, copper, iron, iridium, brass, nickel.
We'll have to try hundreds more, maybe thousands.
But I know that somewhere in this universe...
...is a substance which will work and we're going to find it.
We've got to have a light much brighter for its size than any gaslight...
...or it's no good at all.
If platinum won't give it to us,
I don't know what will.
- Shall I connect it?
- Yes.
Well, it ought to work, but it won't.
I don't know, it must be some reason we haven't thought of.
Or else we haven't the right material.
We've tried everything but this.
Now cry, son, cry.
Now cry, cry, cry.
Cry, son, cry.
- Doesn't he cry?
- He has quite frequently.
Never when I'm around. I've been trying to get him to cry since he was 9 months old.
Come son, cry, please.
Now cry. Cry, son, cry.
- Oh, Tom, this is terrible.
- What's terrible?
Listen to this.
"When asked for an opinion of
Mr. Edison's claim, the professor stated, "There is no room in the world of science for a charlatan."
- Tom.
- There, there, do you hear that?
Your father's a faker.
Everybody says so.
Well, don't you see?
Look at that.
He doesn't care. I'm disgraced and he sits here calm and peaceful.
Read it to him again slowly.
Maybe we can get him to understand.
I hope I never lay eyes on that
Bunt Cavatt again.
Oh, don't be too hard on Bunt.
He and I had some good times together.
I'd like to shake his head until his brains rattled.
Look, son, cry, please.
I don't suppose Bunt has enough brains in his head to rattle.
No, sort of a vacuum, I guess.
Well, even the vacuum can be useful at times.
I remember I had an old bird dog once...
Vacuum.
Vacuum.
By George!
Tom, what on earth?
Simon, Simon!
We need a vacuum. That's what we've been looking for.
The wire can't burn brightly enough without melting...
...because it's exposed to the open air.
Too much oxygen. We'll enclose the wire in a glass globe.
Pump out the air, turn on the current and see what happens.
No, tonight.
- How was that?
- That'll do for the present.
- Thanks.
- Turn on the current.
She burns it up brighter now.
Not bright enough. We'll have to improve the vacuum.
But Tom, I've got it down to one/one hundred thousandth of an atmosphere already.
- We'll have to do better than that.
- But we can't do it. Not with this pump.
There's a mercury pump over at
Princeton that could do the trick.
Wonder if we can borrow that.
Have we got enough vacuum, Mike?
It's as good as we'll ever get.
Alright, turn on the current.
Well, here we go.
Well, we failed again.
That's the net result of nine thousand experiments.
Too bad, Tom.
We know the work you have done.
We are as sorry as you are that you didn't get results.
Results? Man, I got a lot of results.
I know nine thousand things now that won't work.
It's a shame.
I'd like to see Mr. Edison, please.
What about?
I want to study to be an inventor.
You do, huh?
Why?
Well, because inventors make things, and I like to make things.
And look.
See that?
- See how easy it works?
- Let's see it again.
Pretty good.
I made it myself, I was always breaking my thumb nail.
Think you can make me one?
I don't know.
I might.
- It ain't much of a knife, is it?
- It will be when you fix it up.
- Tom, don't feel too bad.
- Mr. Els.
This young man wants to be an inventor. What is your name?
- Jimmy Price
- Alright, Jimmy, this is Mr. Els.
Jimmy's going to work here with us.
Where are you staying, Jimmy?
I mean, where are you sleeping?
Well, for the time being I guess
I'll just have to sleep right here.
Take him over to the boarding house.
Give him a good meal and a room.
What's the matter?
Gosh...
Are you Thomas Edison?
Well, I think I am, Jimmy. Sometimes I get a little confused about it.
You report at eight in the morning for work.
Good morning, Tom.
- Good morning, boys.
- Good morning.
- Will it light?
- Hm-hmm.
We're going to use carbon for a filament instead of metal.
- Filament? I never heard that word before.
- Neither did I. I just made it up.
That's ordinary sewing thread.
I want you to put it in the oven and bake it for about an hour, you see?
Get it thoroughly impregnated with carbon first, the way this is.
Then we'll put it in the bulb and try it.
But the thread is too delicate, Tom.
The heat'll break it.
Well, we'll try it anyway.
- But we've tried carbon before.
- Not carbonized thread.
That isn't very scientific, Tom.
I told you we had to leave science behind! Come on!
Be careful you don't break that filament.
It's number 65.
- Did it break? Is it alright?
- It's going to be alright.
Look, it's holding together.
Jimmy, take it up to Mr. Edison, but be careful
I'll be right up.
By guns, Jimmy, can't you stand on your feet?
There goes a whole day's work.
Jimmy.
Jimmy!
Yes?
Careful with this one now
It's still hot.
Come on, come on, Jimmy, we're wasting time.
Come on.
Nice thing about mistakes, they don't have to be permanent.
I had to learn that by myself when I was a kid.
A shoe filament.
A cotton sewing thread, impregnated with carbon, and sealed in a vacuum.
Alright, we'll give it the live test.
I'm almost afraid to turn the switch.
Here we go.
Well.
Looks as if this one is going to last.
Still burning.
- Well, it must be 7:00.
- Yeah, and after.
How about a cup of coffee?
No, no, I'll have a glass of milk.
- Bring a glass for Jimmy, too.
- Sure.
A piece of pie.
Ashton, you'd better go home and get some sleep.
He's been here all day.
I won't fall out of bed, Mama.
Good night, darling.
Close your eyes.
Come on.
- Can I lace my shoes?
- Hm-hmm.
- Don't I look pretty in my pink dress?
- Oh, you do.
# Oh, Genevieve #
# Sweet Genevieve #
# The days may come #
# The days may go #
# But still the hands of memory weave #
# The blissful dreams of long ago #
Give it a little more current.
Give it all it will take.
Turn up the gas.
- Forty hours.
- My, my.
Well, if it'll burn forty hours, it'll burn four hundred.
Put that filament under a microscope.
- What's the date?
- October, 21st.
He's calling the newspapers.
He's going to light New York City!
Good, I'm going to bed.
Take it easy, Jim. All worry ever got me was indigestion.
Look, Sneed, if Edison gets the franchise to light this town,
I may as well make a bonfire of my gas stocks.
Let him have it. The light probably won't work.
That's the trouble, it will work.
Everything Edison invents works, and works well.
I found that out to my sorrow.
What do you want me to do?
Stop him from getting that franchise.
I see no reason, gentlemen, why Mr. Thomas A. Edison should not be granted a franchise...
...to electrically illuminate the specified district under discussion.
Mr. Chairman, your own enthusiasm is not shared by all of us by a long shot.
We are asked to let this man use New
York as a testing ground for his...
The light has been tested thoroughly.
You've been shown that its fire hazard is so much less than that of gas...
Just a minute.
Gas is not on trial here.
No, but I can see that the electric light is.
Gentlemen, I've told you that we're willing to put our wires underground,
...so they will not overburden your telephone poles.
I've assured you we'll take every other necessary precautions.
I still say the risk is too great for his impossible claims.
But they're not impossible.
And even if it were, my associates and I are the ones taking the risk.
We're not asking New York City for any financial aid.
We're merely asking for permission to install our equipment at our own risk, at our own expense, and if we fail, at our own loss.
That seems fair enough.
Shall we vote on it?
- Yes. Yes.
- Mr. Edison!
One thing more, if you please. You know that no dynamo in existence...
...is capable of producing the current necessary to supply your lighting system.
Yes, sir, that's quite true.
Then how do you propose to perform this miracle?
I'm going to build a dynamo. I'm going to build a dynamo big enough to do the job.
One word, please,
I demand to be heard.
Mr. Taggart, this is extremely presumptuous.
Let him speak, he's a taxpayer.
- Make it brief, Mr. Taggart.
- Thank you.
I want to repectfully call the attention of this board to the law which requires...
...that a specified time limit be put in all contracts.
Mr. Edison's project must be completed on some definite day.
That's the law.
Mr. Edison, how long will this experiment of yours take?
- It won't be an experiment, Mr. Taggart.
- Please, don't let's quibble.
- How long will it take?
- It'll take a year, perhaps two.
There we are, gentlemen.
One year, perhaps two.
That means that for two years the streets of the city of New York are to be torn up.
And traffic at a standstill. As a taxpayer,
I protest against such an outrage.
I protest with all the vehemence at my command.
What would you suggest then?
I suggest that Mr. Edison be limited to three months.
Can you do it in three months,
Mr. Edison?
No, sir.
And I doubt if Mr. Taggart could pipe the same area for gas in three months.
The gas is already there, Mr. Edison, functioning for the benefit...
...of thousands of grateful taxpayers.
I say those taxpayers have rights.
Rights its the duty of this board to protect.
Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Edison.
I didn't come here this morning to deprive the taxpayers of any rights.
I'm inviting this Board to let them make use of a discovery...
...which will endanger and handicap no one...
...but those who are afraid of its competition with their own monopolies.
Your own experts have shown you that the electric light is practical.
Its enemies know that it will be a cheaper form of illumination than gas.
And that's the reason they're against it.
But that's not the reason
I'm fighting for it.
I didn't hunt for it over a period of years...
...because I thought there'd be money at the end of the search.
It's because I've always known that if we could find the light without a flame, that you could put into homes where men and women...
...are ruining their eyesight under oil lamps and gas jets, where surgeons are performing operations, where doctors are working over microscopes, men down coal mines, people everywhere...
...could have a safer and a brighter light.
That I'd be doing something that every one of them would be grateful to me for...
...whether they ever paid me in money or not.
Now that light has been found!
What are you going to do about it?
Could you completely pipe that district in six months, Mr. Taggart?
Easily.
Alright, then, let's say six months, how's that?
- Shall we vote on it, gentlemen?
- Yes.
All in favor of granting the franchise under discussion?
- Aye.
- All against?
- Nay.
- Accepted. The franchise is granted.
- I congratulate you, Mr. Edison.
- Six months!
That's about September, 4th.
I'll have to hurry.
Thank you, sir.
- Tom.
- Oh, thanks.
- What do we call her, boys?
- It's the biggest in the world.
- Alright, we'll call it Jumbo.
- I christen you Jumbo!
Here, here, here!
It can't be wasted.
Two o'clock. Five hours to spare.
Power them for a load test.
Stand by for a full load test, boys.
Number 1.
Alright, number 2.
Throw them in parallel.
We're out of speed!
Faster, faster.
We're out of speed.
More, now! More, more speed!
Stop it, stop it!
I don't know what caused this problem.
The engines were not running at the same speed.
One dynamo was pulling, the other didn't follow.
The trouble must be with those governors.
We'll have to connect those governors together with a shaft.
But we can't do it now, Tom.
It's too big a job.
Send one of the men down to Gertz St. and get 15 feet of one-inch steel shafting.
Five hours are not enough, Tom.
We haven't got the time.
We haven't got time to talk about it.
Go and do it.
Come on, men. Let's see what damage was done now.
Let's get going.
Come on!
Why don't they play some chiff music?
- Mr. Taggart.
- Go away, Hall. Go away.
Mr. Taggart, listen.
- Very interesting, very interesting.
- I thought you'd like to know, sir.
Very thoughtful of you, Hall. Thank you.
Gentlemen, I've just received very heartening news.
- What is it?
- Our friend Edison has stumbled.
At the last minute he has miscalculated.
His dynamos have broken down.
What lovely music.
Alright, turn it.
The other way.
Does it bind?
Running nice and smooth.
Alright. Put the belt on.
Tom, what happened?
Oh, Jumbo developed some bug at the last minute.
Oh, look at your trousers.
Tom, your new blue suit.
How do you suppose that happened?
Oh, I'll never be able to fix that.
What's the matter, dear?
- I'm worried.
- About the dynamos?
Suppose they fail to work?
- They won't.
- You should have been here a while ago.
I wish I had your confidence.
I wish I had yours.
- Tom, one minute to seven.
- Right on the dot.
Remind me to give you a big hug and a kiss afterwards, will you?
Go on, get out of the way.
- All ready, boys?
- Yeah, ready.
- Go ahead, Mike.
- Stand by, boys.
Now, number 1.
Take it easy, take it easy now.
Number 2.
Alright, throw them in parallel.
Go ahead.
Hooray!
Lower those feeders switches.
And yet, he would have been a great man...
...even if had never invented anything.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you a name that will remain...
...forever vital with courage, and vibrant with inspiration.
Thomas Alva Edison.
Mr. Toastmaster...
Mr. Toastmaster, ladies and gentlemen.
To be told by the outstanding men and women of your time...
...that you have contributed a great deal to human betterment is pleasant.
Very pleasant.
I'd hardly be humored if my heart didn't fill from such a magnificent compliment.
But somehow I have not yet achieved a success I want.
Earlier this evening, I talked with two school children.
Tomorrow, the world will be theirs.
It's a troubled world, full of doubt and uncertainty.
You say we men of science have been helping it.
Are those children and their children...
...going to approve of what we've done?
Or are they going to discover too late...
...that science was trusted too much...
...so that it has turned into a monster...
...whose final triumph is man's own destruction?
Some of us are beginning to feel that danger.
But it can be avoided.
I once had two dynamos.
They needed regulating.
It was a problem of balance and adjustment.
And I feel that the confusion in the world today, presents much the same problem.
But dynamo of man's God given ingenuity...
...is running away with the dynamo of his equally God given humanity.
I am too old now to do much more than to say:
Put those dynamos in balance.
Make them work in harmony, as the great designer intended they should.
It can be done.
What man's mind can see, man's character can control.
Man must learn that.
And then we needn't be afraid of tomorrow.
And man will go forward...
...toward more light.

You've got to get out of Holland at once.
You will got to Lisbon first where you will report to Quintanilla.
Quintanilla?
- Yes.
You must be in Lisbon within ten days.
Good luck, Van Der Lyn.
- Thank you.

Someone is in for a surprise.
That's Pereira.
Pereira?
- Police.
Richard Benson, English. Otto Lutzke,
German. And this Vincent Van Der Lyn.
That's the entire list, Captain.
I assume you'll want to check Lutzke's papers?
At the moment, I'm most interested in this Van Der Lyn.
Look mummy. Lights, lights.
He's never seen city lights before.
He was so little when war broke out.
This way Senors and Senora's.
Warsaw used to be like this.
- I remember Prague.
In Brussels you could read the newspaper at night.
"All passengers from Madrid."
"Your baggage will be inspected at the customs desk inside the building."
"Flight 11 from Madrid."
"Have your passports ready for immigration inspection."
Otto Lutzke.
This is your 14th visit, Senor. You know the regulations regarding aliens.
Portugal is neutral.
- In spite of the British in the Azores?
And the Cape Verde islands.
In spite of that too, Herr Lutzke.
Such neutrality is one-sided,
Captain Pereira. Your sympathies ..
My sympathies do not affect the way in which I perform my duties, Herr Lutzke.
Next.
Vincent Van Der Lyn.
I am sure you will remember that when you examine this next gentleman.
Your name?
- Vincent Van Der Lyn.
Nationality?
- Dutch.
This is not a Dutch passport.
No, I was in France when ..
- I merely comment.
I ask no explanation.
Your occupation?
Engineer.
- Not school teacher?
Why yes, I taught school in Holland.
But that was ..
- You have business in Portugal?
None. I am leaving for
England tomorrow night.
Your Portuguese visa is good for only 36 hours.
If you stay longer it will be very awkward.
I got my visa for England in Madrid.
My friends here made reservations on your plane ..
I notice there are no stamps in your passport from the German border control.
Well, you see the day I crossed the Spanish border ..
I merely comment.
The Portuguese visa is in order.
My only concern.
- Thank you.
I wish to remind you Van Der Lyn, that Portugal is a neutral country.
We deplore certain types of activity here.
And our police are very strict.
Thanks again.
Next.
Your exit pass, please.
Thank you.
- Will you check this for me?
I'll wait here.
Exit pass please.
Sorry.
Here you are.
- Thank you.
Yes, Excellence.
I want to report one passenger.
He boarded a plane at Madrid.
I got a look at his passport.
It's a French passport.
But he has a Dutch name.
I couldn't learn any more.
I tried to draw him out in conversation, but he cut me off, even insulted me.
Insulted you?
Well Lutzke, your face is not exactly soothing, nor your manner.
Why do you annoy me with such nonsense at this hour?
But Excellence, the passport.
I looked carefully. It was not stamped by our border control with France.
He must have stolen across to Spain.
What's the name on that passport?
Vincent.
Van Der Lyn.
Alright, Lutzke.
Keep an eye on this man. I want to know where he goes tonight.
Don't alarm him. Don't be crude.
Above all, I want to know who this Van Der Lyn really is.
Souvenirs.
Souvenirs.
Do you know a good pawnshop?
There are no good pawnshops, my friend.
A pawnshop is the graveyard of dead hopes.
Still, you can direct me.
Go to the Café Imperial.
There you will be contacted.
Taxi!
This way, Monsieur.
But Stefan, this is madness. You can't stow away on a small English boat.
I'll take any risk that will get me out of this place.
Can I have butter?
As much butter as I want?
Certainly, sir. What else?
Don't rush me please.
I want white bread. Lots of butter.
Steak, that thick. Medium rare.
Sauce Béarnaise, Lyonnaise potatoes. Green salad.
Do you have any Holland cheese?
Yes, Senor. Edam and gouda.
The Germans sell us lots of it.
- Then I won't have it.
And for dessert ..
Crêpes Suzette made with good Dutch Curaçao.
And coffee .. real coffee.
That will be all, Senor?
I've been planning this dinner for three years.
Cognac.
River Casa number 29. Use this card.
He will have one just like it.
[ Gunshot! ]
Seven point 63, Luger.
They shot Duvalier.
Follow me.
Will you be kind enough to order me some sherry?
I shall be delighted, Madame.
Two sherries, please.
- Yes, Senor.
And, what will you have for dinner?
Dinner?
When a charming lady invites herself for a drink, I assume she wants dinner too.
I suppose I owe you an explanation.
Oh, some things are much better without an explanation.
I sat down because ..
- Yes?
I thought I recognised you.
Didn't we meet in Paris?
No.
Copenhagen of course.
- I've never been in Copenhagen.
You are making it very difficult.
- I warned you.
Some things are much better without explanations.
Cigarette?
- No thank you.
Well, let's start all over.
- This time I'll help you.
You sit down. You don't know me.
You should say: "why darling".
Look puzzled.
But I'm very glad you sat down.
And I say: "unfortunately, madam".
My name is not "darling".
It is "Vincent".
It is Vincent.
Now you are embarrassed. So you say:
"I am terribly sorry, but I thought you were someone I met in Bombay".
I have never been in Bombay.
Now you are making it difficult.
You drink, Irene?
How did you know my name?
Your handkerchief.
You are very clever.
You are very nervous.
To you.
And to no explanations.
You don't trust me.
Let's just say I'm delighted by your company and enchanted by your beauty.
And extremely curious to know who you are and why you sat down at my table.
Some things are much better without explanations.
Touché.
I'm told Lisbon is a strange city, a city of echoes and shadows.
A hundred eyes watch your every move.
That sounds like a warning.
It is.
You are taking chances rather quickly.
- Don't you?
All the time.
- And ..?
What happens?
- So far, I've won.
Then you should go to Estoril.
What's Estoril?
- The Monte Carlo of Portugal.
Do you ever go there?
- Almost every night.
I am a born gambler.
That's why I sat down at your table.
And .. did you win or lose?
I won.
So did I.
Now.
What would you like to start with?
Hors d'oeuvres or seafood?
Bouillon, onion soup, potage St-Germain?
Anything you choose.
But first I want to make a telephone call.
Will you excuse me?
Do you know a good pawnshop?
- No, I don't.
A pawnshop is a graveyard of dead hopes.
Still, you can direct me?
Yes. You need to meet me tomorrow morning at 9:30
Thos Course Travel Bureau.
You are welcome to come.
Service for two, please.
Yes, Senor. It's been taken care of.
By the way, where is the telephone?
Over there.
What is over there?
The back entrance, Senor.
But your dinner, Senor. You have planned it for three years.
I have changed my plans in the last three minutes.
Waiter .. my check.
Boy.
What is the name of this famous gambling place of yours?
Estoril, Senor.
It's about 18 miles from here.
35 minutes by taxi.
Taxi.
- Yes, sir. Taxi!
Did you get a good look at him?
- Yes.
Then here is the eagle.
Madame, you're winnings.
Madame.
Yes, thank you.
Yes darling, I am coming.
I beg your pardon.
Haven't you made a mistake?
A mistake?
I don't believe we've met before.
What is this, Irene?
- My name is not Irene.
But at the Café Imperial.
- I've never been at the Café Imperial.
Only half an hour ago.
- I've been here all evening.
You are a poor liar. A very poor liar.
That's why I trust you.
Irene.
We won't be overheard here.
Now you can explain a few things.
I mustn't be seen with you.
You should have thought of that before you sat at my table.
There was no time.
Why did you sit down?
I had to.
Go on.
That's all.
- That's not enough.
Someone is coming here for me.
I came here for you, too.
- But you don't understand.
No I don't. But I intend to.
What happened at The Imperial?
I ..
I had an appointment with someone.
There was an accident.
I was afraid and ran into the café.
And the police followed you.
I did nothing wrong.
But ..
You tell only half the story.
What am I supposed to think?
Forget we ever met.
- I can't forget that.
You mustn't see me again. For your sake.
And for yours?
Irene.
So here you are, darling.
I looked for you at the tables.
My luck was bad, so I have been waiting out here.
Oh Hugo, this is Vincent ..
- Van Der Lyn.
It's hard to pronounce.
- I think it's easy to pronounce.
Van Der Lyn?
- Right.
I am Von Mohr.
The moment I leave you alone, Irene, you run into some mischief or adventure.
I never know quite what to expect.
Hugo, you love to exaggerate.
No .. I love to observe.
Come on, darling. An old friend wants to say hello to you.
Have you been waiting long?
I was delayed. Will you join us?
No thank you.
- Oh, too bad.
You should meet people while you are in Lisbon, Van Der Lyn.
It is a fascinating city.
Now long are you staying?
- Not long.            - Why?
Where will you be going?
Away.
A wise man ..
He speaks little, he sees much.
And he has already met you.
I told you she was here.
Herr Lutzke, this is a surprise.
Much of a surprise?
Lutzke, this is Vincent Van Der Lyn.
I think we have met before.
We are late.
Lutzke will go with us, Irene. I insist it.
He said he had some urgent business, but I wouldn't hear it.
Goodbye, Van Der Lyn.
- Goodbye.
Was machst du hier?
What? Oh, I don't speak German.
Excuse me, Senor. Excuse me.
- Why did you address me in German?
Well, seeing you with
Herr Van Mohr. I ..
What about him?
Well, who but a German would be speaking to an official of the German embassy?
I beg your pardon, sir. I meant no harm.
I merely assumed that ..
- That's alright.
May I buy you a drink, sir?
To repay you for the cigarette. Remember?
Of course I do. Thank you.
Don't stay in Lisbon tonight.
- Why not?
Do you know Cascais?
It's an old fishing village.
Three kilometres north.
Friendly people.
Ask for Miguel.
What will you have, gentlemen?
Yes, what will you drink?
Tell me. Where is Miguel.
Grandfather is over there by the fire.
Have you had your supper?
I was interrupted.
Be patient then.
Soon you can sample my feast.
It is famous from one end of this village to the other.
Very good of you. Thank you.
I wonder if you could do me one more kindness.
Lend me some work clothes.
Why, of course.
You will find them in there.
You must be tired.
The nets are not easy.
- No.
But it was good to sweat.
This kind of work is good.
You can forget yourself in it.
You came from Estoril.
Did you lose much?
- I didn't gamble.
I understand.
You didn't gamble and yet you lost.
Yes, I'm afraid I lost.
Would you like some wine, Senor?
- Why yes. Thank you, Rosa.
Is it possible Senor, they say Portugal is the last country in Europe ..
Where you can still get wine.
Yes, that's true.
The Nazis have a way of taking everything.
That's why we've learned to destroy all they can use or get their hands on.
Even the things dearest to us.
I know those Germans.
One time near Biarritz I was taken for smuggling.
Ha ha.
And you were as scared as a rat.
- And so would you be.
After a while you wouldn't be.
The Germans have created a new profession all over Europe.
People who fight them, in every land.
Even with their bare hands.
It's not a new profession.
It's as old as the world.
What kind of people are they?
Just people.
You know them?
Yes.
I was a schoolteacher in Holland.
One morning, I was writing a lesson on the blackboard.
The Nazis came.
They came so suddenly, I didn't even have time to know what was happening.
There were dead people in the streets.
And a military band in the square.
One of my pupils, a 14-year old boy, jumped to the blackboard.
And wrote three words on it.
"Long Live Liberty."
A German officer shot that boy.
And arrested me.
They arrested me for teaching dangerous thoughts.
But I escaped.
Those who escaped learned to hide, to do without food, without sleep and rest.
They also learned to throw bombs and cut wires.
To blow up trains and destroy power stations.
Many times a message is left.
So that when the Germans reach the scene all they find is a wreck.
And a piece of paper with three words on it.
The words that 14-year old boy wrote on the blackboard.
"Long live liberty".
Forgive me, I ..
I didn't mean to make a speech.
I've been alone so long.
Did everything go right at the village?
- Yes, they are good people.
I'll take you to the others.
They are waiting.
It's only about ten minutes from here.
Ah, they are checking passports again.
If they take you to headquarters they'll question you for hours.
I think we'd better separate.
Follow me but not too closely.
Passport?
I am a Portuguese.
- Where is your identity card?
I left it at home.
Take him.
You wish something, Senor?
Yes, I was looking for a pawnbroker.
I have a watch to pawn. A good quality watch made in Amsterdam.
Welcome. Welcome my friend.
It is good to hear my own tongue.
You flatter me, sir.
My judgement, like everything else in this good pawnshop is second-hand.
Will you follow me, please.
Alright.
Will you follow me through my labyrinth.
This may be melodramatic, but please indulge me.
I love melodrama.
You see, I was a writer before the war.
I now deal in living characters.
The entire continent of Europe ..
Has become the background for a fantastic duel between these characters.
The former Munich paper hanger.
Who once had the poor taste to be one of my most devoted readers.
You are Quintanilla.
Ricardo Quintanilla. How did you know?
I recognise you by your tie.
It is famous all over Europe.
You find it flamboyant?
The one ostentation of an exuberant man.
Who is forced to live like a mole.
Gentlemen.
Vincent Van Der Lyn, the Flying
Dutchman. Our most celebrated colleague.
This is Antone Wynat.
He is from Norway.
A former army sergeant serving under a strict disciplinarian named Quisling.
It's a labour of love for him to provide us arms that are models of efficiency.
I've used your product often.
It always gives satisfaction, except to the Germans.
And this is Larriche.
When the Germans entered Paris ..
He kept up a one-man war against them for some time.
Not only from alleyways and rooftops.
But from within the very walls of their ministries.
I remember now.
We have some mutual friends in Paris.
You have met Bernazsky your guide?
Why, I am the least important of our unit. In fact ..
I have little to recommend me except .. always good manners.
Always?
Well up to a point.
A man can lose his patience.
And now gentlemen, if you permit me I have ..
Procured a bottle of Holland gin to welcome our guest.
Good?
Bernazsky is full of unexpected little courtesies.
As the Nazis found out when they encountered him in Warsaw.
Tell him.
Oh, it's really nothing.
You see, the Nazis had heard of my collection of clocks and ..
As they all are notorious lovers of art ..
Well, they decided to move the collection to their beloved Berlin.
There was one clock.
A 16th century masterpiece.
Exquisite.
As the hours struck the tiny little doors opened.
And out came The Apostles.
At 1 o'clock St John, at 2 o'clock St Luke and so on.
The gentlemen of the
Gestapo were fascinated.
So they sent for their commander.
He was a particularly energetic collector of art ..
In the services of his Excellency,
Field Marshall Goering.
I am afraid I wasn't up to my best behaviour that day.
I slipped out of the house and left them waiting for St Peter.
And?
They didn't have to wait long.
The little door opened.
Out came St Peter.
But I had taken the liberty of providing the saint with a little dynamite and ..
[ Click ]
They were hoisted to heaven along with all the art treasures of the family.
But gentlemen, we gathered to praise the guest.
And we wind up by praising ourselves.
A sad commentary on human nature.
To your success.
Good hunting and happy landings.
Salud.
Skol.        - Sante.
- Prost.
I'm afraid business intrudes on our pleasures.
You understand your instructions?
We know that our man was killed with a .763 Luger.
We are to find out who had such a gun.
They are good men, your Lieutenants.
Yes, very good.
It is unfortunate that one of them may be a traitor.
A traitor?
But I welcome this opportunity to talk to you.
When are you leaving Lisbon?
Tomorrow.
I'm going to London to join the Dutch Air Force.
I want to fight in the open.
To revenge your family?
- Yes.
Yes. One more service you can do for us before you leave.
I'm sending a man into the territory where you've been operating.
It's imperative that he be in possession of every scrap of knowledge you have.
When do the Nazi sentinels change guard on the road from Bückburg to Wiegendorf?
Every four hours.
Where does the Nazi commander in Middelkerke eat his breakfast?
In his room. Hotel Europe.
Do we have friends in
Hilversum radio station?
Why yes, the night janitor.
Such knowledge is invaluable.
I want you to see a man.
This is the man.
His name is Jennings.
I've sent many an agent into Nazi
Europe but none so important as this.
You must not fail.
Serve him well.
He leaves here Sunday night. He must reach the low countries unharmed.
If he doesn't, it may result in a disaster involving thousands of our men.
He must have information, such as you have just given me.
Details, hundreds of them.
We've rented a hotel room for you and sent your baggage to it.
Jennings will meet you there tonight at ten.
We'll risk no more leaks here.
I'll tell him all I know.
Well?
Please, Senor. I've done no wrong.
I was just bringing this.
Who gave you this?
Who gave you this?
A lady .. I don't know her.
I was just walking down the street, Senor.
A lady came out of the house and asked if I wanted to earn five escudos.
She gave me the letter and told me to bring it here.
She knew where I was staying?
Oh yes, Senor.
She told me: Hotel Bracha, room 214.
Where does she live?
She gave me five more escudos to forget.
I'll give you ten to remember.
She would not like me to tell.
But you are wrong.
You know, my boy that ..
Women don't know their own minds in matters of romance.
Oh, I see.
She lives on the Rua Do
Seculo, Senor. Number 118.
How did you find my hotel?
- You shouldn't have come here.
I'll drive you to the corner.
I am going much farther than that.
Will you leave now, please?
How did you find out where I was staying?
That was easy. I called all the places where foreigners stay in Lisbon.
There aren't many.
Hotel Bracha told me you were registered there.
That was all there was to it.
Now, will you please go.
You left your coat.
Oh yes.
Would you mind?
What do you think you're doing?
You and I are going to have a nice, long talk.
My hat!
It's very pretty.
- It's being ruined.
Then take it off.
The wind is good for your hair.
How long will this go on?
Until you are ready to talk.
Look.
- No.
But you've driven thirty kilometres.
It's relaxing, isn't it?
- It's ridiculous.
Quite.
I've an appointment in Lisbon.
So have I. At ten o'clock.
Alright. I give up.
That's better. Much better.
There must be a place up ahead where we can eat. I am hungry.
I'm not.
Then you can watch me. It's educational.
She sat at down Van Der Lyn's table at the Café Imperial.
I know that.
Later, at Estoril, we found her with Van Der Lyn again.
Her politics need not concern you, Lutzke.
Do you think Von Mohr and I play games with each other?
You were ordered to find out where
Van Der Lyn stated last night.
But Excellence, you told me not to arouse his suspicions.
I couldn't follow him after I was introduced face to face.
That should have been avoided.
Perhaps we judge Lutzke too harshly, Excellence.
We can imagine his surprise seeing Irene with ..
Perhaps she could tell us who this Van Der Lyn is?
Unfortunately, she does not know.
But I do.
I telephoned Berlin.
Vincent Van Der Lyn is better known to the Gestapo ..
As "The Flying Dutchman".
You were in trouble last night at the café.
Yes.
At Estoril you were waiting for Von Mohr?
Yes.
And Herr Lutzke?
- No.
You called Von Mohr, "Hugo".
That suggests that you know him well.
I do.
He is an official of the German Legation.
I'm not German, if that's what you're leading up to.
I'm French.
I was born in France and I lived there until ..
After the Germans came.
Then my instinct was right from the first.
I've had every reason to suspect all you've said and done since we met.
Yet my feelings kept denying my suspicions.
And when you look at me the way you are looking now, all my questions disappear.
Because I know that no matter who you are or what you've done ..
You helped me last night.
Please forget the rest.
- I can't forget you.
But you mustn't come into my life.
I'm part of your life already and you of mine.
Please, as long as you're in Lisbon.
I'm leaving Lisbon in the morning for England.
There is no reason for me to think that
I will ever see you again after tonight.
And yet I know in my heart that we will meet again.
You and I.
But now there isn't much time.
No. There isn't.
That song is a "Fado".
Fado means "Fate".
I believe in fate.
This song is about a love that can never be.
I can't believe that.
I'll tell you what this song is about.
It's about a man and a woman who met in a strange and wonderful way.
Each was in danger.
Each was on guard.
And yet, as they looked at each other ..
- But those aren't the words.
To me, all these songs are sad.
Like the first Fado I ever heard.
The words still haunt me.
"For the love of you I lost God".
"For the love of you, I lost myself".
"Now I see myself alone".
"Without God".
"Without love".
"Without .. you".
That's what the song is about.
No.
That's what the words are about.
But the song, if you listen to it with your heart means ..
"In the love of you, I lost myself".
And now I am alone no more.
But with God.
With love.
With you.
Don't say anything my darling.
Listen to me.
Come to England. Forget everything.
Forget whatever holds you here.
- But I ..
I don't care about the past.
You don't know.
I don't want to know any more than this.
Hugo and I ..
Hugo?
I've been trying to tell you.
- What are you talking about?
He took me out of Dachau.
Yes, Dachau. The concentration camp.
That's where I was sent by the Germans.
That's where I spent four months of living death.
It was Hugo who got me out.
It was Hugo who saved my life.
I will do anything for him.
No, Irene. No!
That's gratitude, devotion but not love.
He is my husband.
You and I should never have met.
Never.
Wait.
- Don't go yet.
There is no time.
Forget time. Just for another moment.
There will never be enough time, Irene.
Please forgive me.
Good evening, Senor.
Hello, Jennings.
Jennings. Wake up.
Jennings, it's Van Der Lyn.
Tell.
Yes?
They ..
- Who?
Took the eagle.
Who Jennings? What eagle?
Who did it?
You must be mistaken, Captain.
I run a respectable hotel.
I investigate every tip, Senor.
Why did you kill him?
I didn't.
- What's his name?
I don't know.
- What was he doing here?
I can't answer that.
So this was your business in Lisbon?
You disappoint me, Van Der Lyn.
Madame.
I've been hoping to find you here.
Captain Weigert. I haven't seen you since Budapest.
Wrong, Madame. Since Rome.
Ah, your memory is as impressive as your uniform.
Irene, we've been waiting for you.
I think you are late on purpose.
Of course. I like to have you wait.
If I didn't, I'd be on time.
You haven't changed.
- You haven't noticed.
To the most intriguing woman in Portugal.
To the most outrageous flatterers in Europe.
If he is found guilty ..?
- Guilty, trial ..
You can't meddle with a man like Van Der Lyn.
If this happened in Germany ..
- I know what would happen in Germany.
I think what his Excellency means ..
- Ah, lovely. Excuse me, gentlemen.
My dear.
- Hugo.
As ranking officer of the Lisbon Police
I think I'm entitled to kiss your hand.
Oh, I am delighted, Colonel. And very glad I haven't committed a crime.
I hope you will, Madame.
For then I shall be sure to see you often.
Madame.
One more point, Colonel.
This Jennings was English.
If I were the British Ambassador,
I would create a stir about this.
He already has.
- Colonel.
The criminal was caught in the room.
With a revolver in his hand.
Gentlemen, what are you talking about?
About the arrest my dear, of a man named Vincent Van Der Lyn.
For murder.
The British are stubborn.
- They are not the only ones who are.
May I escort you through this dangerous arena of diplomacy to the punch bowl?
Irene.
It is late, my dear.
I hadn't noticed.
- It's past three.
Really?
You seem upset.
I have a headache.
The wine. There were so many people there.
Could it be my dear, that the news upset you?
News?
- About Van Der Lyn.
Hugo.
Vincent and I were together all day.
I know.
I'm glad.
I wanted you to know.
I've seen many men attracted to you, darling.
And I've always admired the way you handle their infatuation.
I understand you, Irene.
As I know you understand me.
No matter what happened, it can't change the bond between us.
We have gone through so much, you and I.
So much that no man can destroy.
Tonight, when I saw you at The Legation.
You looked so lovely.
So indescribably lovely.
And now.
Your face is like a vision.
Don't.
You didn't sleep last night, Senor.
No.
You will learn to sleep.
I must get a message to someone.
There's time.
There is no time, no time at all.
After a few years one learns patience.
Patience?
Must you sweep all the time? Every minute!
It's something to do.
I'm sorry.
I make them myself.
Thanks.
I've made almost eleven thousand.
I've been here eighteen years.
What for?
I killed someone.
Did you ever kill anyone?
Yes.
- Why?
In the war.
You were a soldier, Senor?
In a way.
- You liked to kill?
No.
That makes it harder, I know.
I killed a man because he betrayed me.
That's why I killed him.
Did someone betray you?
Yes.
- A friend?
I thought so.
- Oh.
I ..
Couldn't kill a woman.
I would kill a traitor.
He couldn't have done it. He couldn't.
The evidence against
Van Der Lyn is undeniable.
But you admit you found no motive.
- Motive? My dear Frau Von Mohr.
If I tried to find the motive of every foreigner in Lisbon, man or woman ..
I should be lost in a morass of intrigue and deception.
Lisbon has become a city of hidden walls.
The vendettas of all Europe are raging in our cafés and plazas.
But he was trying to get to England.
That's the only reason he came here.
A man who slipped through the Gestapo's hands.
Who escaped through
Holland and France ..
Might have a very good reason for killing Jennings.
Nothing you have told me
Madame, changes the facts.
There is one fact you don't know.
I was with him yesterday.
- You?
Yes, until almost ten.
Just before he was arrested.
We were together all day.
We drove in my car.
I showed him the sights.
We went to a tavern.
And talked.
We talked about so many things.
Do you wish to testify in court as a witness?
I ..? But my husband? The Embassy?
I couldn't.
Well Madame, officially there is no more I can say.
But .. as a friend.
As one who can sympathise with a woman's feelings.
Perhaps you should see Van Der Lyn?
Talk to him.
Oh yes. Let me see him.
Let me talk to him.
Send in Captain Pereira.
Oh, but Colonel.
No-one must know.
I shall keep your secret, Madame.
Thank you.
Yes, Colonel Almeida?
This lady will remain anonymous.
Take her to the prison to see Van Der Lyn. Madame ..
Vincent.
Who sent you?
Sent me? No-one. I want to ..
- You have talked to Von Mohr?
No Vincent. They don't know I'm here.
They don't even know I went to Almeida.
I told the police about yesterday.
That we were together.
Did you tell them how your trap worked?
Did you give all the charming details?
I don't understand what you're saying.
You understood well enough to time the whole thing perfectly.
When I got to the hotel room Jennings was dying but he wasn't dead yet.
Perhaps you let me go a minute too soon, Irene?
Perhaps your Nazi friends will reprimand you ..
For not delaying me until the last possible moment.
Vincent, you don't mean that.
You should have kept me another minute, Irene. Another kiss.
Another speech on love.
- Don't.
A long story about a trick life played on you and Von Mohr.
But it's not true. I swear it.
You planned it beautifully.
With every gesture, every word, every kiss.
Vincent, I want to help you.
Help?
With your help a man was murdered.
With your help I was caught like a rat.
With your help, I rot in prison.
- You don't know what you're saying.
Listen.
This morning, before I went to the police. I saw ..
The police? You didn't miss a thing.
You did a perfect job, Irene.
I hope you get well paid for it.
Senor, you talked in your sleep all night.
It's dangerous to talk in one's sleep.
I've got to get out of here.
You talked about a woman.
A beautiful woman.
It's my opinion Senor, that you loved this woman.
No-one can fix this broom.
- Quiet.
Which cell is empty?
- Fifteen. The one on the end.
Get back in your bunk.
- They'll shoot you.
Get back on your bunk.
Hey.
Antonio is sick.
He moaned all night. Needs a doctor.
- What's the matter with him?
That box. The hinge broke.
Smashed his foot.
One smashed foot.
I'll report it.
Unlock the door.
Unlock the door.
Walk .. over there.
Jailbreak!
Get Colonel Almeida.
Yes. Of course it is important.
This is the Commandant of the prison.
And wake the Colonel up.
It's an emergency.
Find out exactly how
Van Der Lyn escaped.
It's incredible, Pereira. Incredible.
To leave without a sign of help.
I don't believe it.
Van Der Lyn is no ordinary man, Colonel Almeida.
There must have been accomplices.
Yes?
"The correspondent for the London
Globe is calling again for a statement."
No statement from anyone.
This isn't just the matter of a man breaking out of jail, Pereira.
The British will protest most vigorously.
The press can make the Jennings murder an international scandal.
I rely on you.
Get Van Der Lyn.
- I will, Colonel.
How?
He must hide. Who will hide him?
Friends. Who are his friends in Lisbon?
The French lady who came to his jail?
Yes.
- My men are watching her.
What else?
Van Der Lyn came here through France and Spain.
But his passport was not stamped by the Germans at any border.
Who would such a man contact?
Quintanilla?
I'm tracing every move he made after he left the airport.
I will find one name.
One word .. to lead me to Van Der Lyn.
With Van Der Lyn in jail everything was fine.
His conviction was a certainty.
But now he is free.
He will move heaven and earth to find out who really did kill Jennings.
I can't risk that.
So we must get Van Der Lyn before the police do.
This is going to hurt a little.
Why didn't you come here as soon as you escaped?
I didn't want to involve you in this.
You might have bled to death had
Rosa not found you on the beach.
Thanks, Rosa.
Thanks, Rosa .. I'll never forget it.
You are a lucky man, Vincent.
The man was a bad shot.
Who was he?
Rosa, Vincent is our guest.
One should never ask questions of guests.
He was only doing his duty.
So was I.
That much I can tell you, Miguel.
Now that it's done, you must sleep.
It isn't done. Not yet.
I've a message to be delivered in Lisbon. Today. Now.
Rosa, don't go.
You can take his message.
At 4:30 an old man went into the pawn shop.
He bought some pottery.
At 6, Bernazsky went in.
- And?
He's still there. Fernando is on duty.
Now, the girl you mentioned.
She's the one who interests me.
She left the shop before Bernazsky came back?      - Yes, Captain.
What did she look like?
- She was young. Wore a bracelet.
She was barefooted.
Yes?
A full report on the police car, captain.
The nearest place to where it was abandoned was Cascais.
Cascais? That's a fishing village.
A bare-footed girl?
Get Montero and Gomez.
Who sent you this time, the police?
Is there a reward on my head?
Miguel. Did she come alone?
Yes, Vincent.
Here. You may need this.
An empty gun, Irene. An empty gesture.
I'm sorry. I forgot.
By whose compliments do I get this?
- Quintanilla.
Quintanilla? Who is Quintanilla?
You know who he is.
He sent me to bring you to him.
I work for Quintanilla.
Oh I see. And you will drive me?
Yes. My car is outside.
A drive I suppose to some secret meeting place.
A lonely house on some lonely road.
And when we get there, whom will I find?
Schmitt, Pereira or Von Mohr?
No. You will find Quintanilla.
And Bernazsky and Wynat and Larriche.
You know all the names.
- And they know mine.
It was quite a coincidence your being at
The Imperial my first night in Lisbon.
No. We often use The Imperial.
The head waiter is one of us.
If you are one of us, why didn't you tell me that before?
I didn't know who you were, until yesterday.
And then I tried to tell you in person, but ..
Pereira was listening at the door.
And you can prove what you've told me?
- Yes, if you come with me.
If you think I'm lying, you know what to do right now, with that gun.
Very well, Irene.
Take me to Quintanilla.
If you can.
Quintanilla.
Hello, Bernazsky.
What's the matter?
- Ricardo.
I told him I was taking him to see you.
He could have refused.
He could have taken my car and driven away. But he didn't.
Thank you, Irene.
Now, Van Der Lyn, perhaps you will tell us why you killed Jennings.
You are not serious.
Yes. We are serious.
I've been questioned by
Mussert's quislings in Holland.
By Rexists in Belgium, Laval's thugs in France, passport officials in Spain.
And the Gestapo all over Europe.
It will be ironical if I am destroyed by my own friends.
Any traitor pretends to be a good man.
He even proves it for a while.
Very well, then.
I killed Jennings.
Why?
The Nazis knew his mission was extremely important.
That he was to leave soon after seeing you.
So I killed him? In my room?
Perhaps you didn't have a chance to do it somewhere else.
Is that all you've got, Quintanilla?
- Tell him, Jan.
Well, I was in the lobby of your hotel and I saw you go up.
The police came.
Jennings was killed and he was killed with your revolver.
What else?
Antoine.
I saw him across the courtyard.
When I got there he was standing over
Jennings still holding the revolver.
I saw him going through
Jennings' pockets.
Then he came up to the window. He leaned out, looking for a way to escape.
But it was too late. The police came.
When I entered my room
Jennings was there, dying.
The revolver was on the floor.
I picked it up.
I searched Jennings pockets.
They were empty.
Then I went to the window. I tried to figure out how the murderer had escaped.
Why didn't you get in touch with me immediately?
Before I could move, the police were in my room.
I heard them say someone had tipped them off.
The murderer, probably.
Who do you think committed the murder?
The Nazis.
In your room, with your revolver?
Ricardo, don't you see ..
- Let him speak.
I told you the truth.
But I know how hard it is sometimes not to be deceived by circumstances.
If I were guilty I would not come here.
I would have gone to the Nazi Legation.
Who helped you to escape from jail?
- Nobody.
It's not easy to escape from a Lisbon jail.
We did not help you.
The only people who could help you were the Nazis. They wanted you to come here.
I could use the gun I have in my pocket.
If I were guilty.
I know that is no proof of my innocence. My past isn't either.
In work such as ours, you have no right to take my word only.
We only want the truth.
I had great respect and admiration for you.
But if you are guilty, well ..
Of course, personally I'm not important.
But you are.
Every human being is important.
Nothing in this world is quite as important.
Every man has a right to be heard.
You've heard Jan, Antoine and me.
And you've heard Van Der Lyn.
Do you think he killed Jennings?
Yes.
Irene?
I trust Vincent as I trust you.
Larriche?
Yes.
Jan?
Yes.
And you, Van Der Lyn?
No.
And you Quintanilla.
What is your opinion?
My sympathies are with Irene.
I too have been fascinated by the image ..
Of the Flying Dutchman. I still am.
It is pleasant to believe that one has found a man of integrity.
In this age of depravity and ruin, I am fascinated.
But not deluded.
You have heard the verdicts of your companions.
It is your voice and Irene's against everybody's.
Why did you come here?
To give you a message.
As I told you, Jennings was dying when I came in.
Barely speaking.
He said: "tell Quintanilla".
And then he added a few words.
I still don't know what they meant.
Maybe nothing. Maybe he was delirious.
But I am sure of what he said.
"Tell Quintanilla, they took the eagle".
Say it again.
Tell Quintanilla they took the eagle.
Would you mind my friends leaving Vincent and me alone?
Please.
A moment, please.
It's only fair you stay a while in our common aim, except Irene's.
Who did not misjudge you.
I offer you our humblest apologies.
Yes, please.
Bernazsky, will you take
Vincent to the fishermen?
Oh yes, and tell our friend
I want him to meet Vincent.
I am sorry, Vincent.
I should say I am very happy.
You didn't believe it.
I hated the very thought of it.
Yet, were it but one chance in a million ..
I had no right to sacrifice the organisation to my faith in you.
Thank you, Vincent.
For what?
- For upholding my faith.
And also for providing me with essential information.
Information?
To meet our people in Paris and points east, Jennings needed credentials.
An eagle?
Well not exactly an eagle.
But that's what we call it.
You see only a very few people know about it and you are not one of them.
My dear Vincent, whoever took the eagle understood its purpose.
The means of identification with our work.
What's to prevent him going to the low countries and passing as our messenger?
Who knew about it?
- Only our people.
No-one else?
- No.
[ Door knocks ]
Come in.
Here is the man I want you to meet.
Now I can tell you.
Hugo is one of us, one of the best.
He belonged to the German foreign service before Hitler, and stayed in to help us.
Think what it means to know what the enemy is doing and planning.
I am glad to see you free.
I am glad to see you here.
It is different from our last meeting.
If I were you, I'd be very careful, Vincent.
Dr Schmitt does not believe in neutrality ..
International law, and like nonsense.
Of course, I will do my best to keep you posted.
But he might try to double-cross me.
Why? Did he give you some indication?
Well no. But he told me again.
I must be ready to leave
Lisbon on a moment's notice.
He couldn't force you to go back to Germany.
What would I be worth to our people were I to become another refugee?
You are right, Von Mohr.
I am glad you are one of us.
Now, would you mind closing the door as you go out, Hugo?
Of course not, Ricardo.
We'll have to act, Vincent.
Jennings mission is still unfulfilled.
If the Nazis send their man to pose as one of us ..
He might have left already.
No .. Jennings was to start tomorrow night.
They'll have to follow the same timetable ..
Not to arouse the suspicion of our people in France.
Couldn't you have warned them?
It takes a long time to send word across the border.
And you have no-one to take Jennings place?
Perhaps.
Why?
The Nazis will try to stop him.
Especially if their own man is leaving too.
Yes.
What if you assemble all your people and tell them the new agent is here?
The one who tries ..
- To get in touch with the Nazis.
Of course, you'll have to keep a watch on all of them.
You should let them have very little time ..
That's worth trying.
It won't prevent their man from leaving.
Of course, we'll get the informer.
- And informers do talk.
Alright, Vincent. And now you are going back to your fishermen?
It's not safe for you here and not safe for us until we get rid of the traitor.
I want to know who he is.
A bit of personal vengeance, huh?
I'm entitled to it.
So you are. So is each one of us.
Fortune, it is not a matter of personal feelings.
Go back to your fishermen. When I've made a decision, I'll let you know.
Goodbye, Vincent.
Oh yes, yes.
A change of clothes.
In case you want to make an impression on your fisher friends.
You had it ready for me all the time?
This is the last time I'll see you.
There is something I wanted you to know.
You don't have to tell me.
- But I want to.
I'm staying with Hugo because ..
He is risking everything and he has nothing left but me.
I understand.
I .. just wanted you to know that's all he means to me.
Yes, Irene.
The Central Committee has just appointed a new agent.
To take Jennings' place.
Even I don't know who he is or where he comes from.
Every precaution is being taken to keep his identity a secret.
The new agent will wait for us tonight in a room at the hotel by the Casino.
We will confer with him at one o'clock.
Where do we meet him?
You will all be in the roulette room at the Casino tonight before 12:45.
You may try your luck at the tables until I arrive.
I shall then give you the number of the hotel room ..
And we shall leave the
Casino ten minutes later.
This time there will be no mistakes, no accidents.
Where Jennings failed, the new agent must succeed.
Vincent should know of these arrangements.
I am leaving the matter in your hands, Bernazsky.
To see this message is delivered to Van Der Lyn.
The fireworks will go off at one o'clock.
At the Casino.
It's Van Der Lyn.
Wait.
Before I kill a man I like to know why I am doing it.
Send Lutzke.
Excellence.
- Excellence.
Did you have to bring them here?
You said it was urgent to save time, Excellence.
I brought them in through the side door.
If you blunder or get into any trouble with the police ..
I won't raise my little finger to help.
- But Herr Lutzke said ..
If you are successful ..
I shall see to it that your records are destroyed.
You can return to the ranks without prejudice.
Thank you, Excellence.
When you are done, report to Lutzke.
Don't come here.
Understand?
- Yah, Excellency.
You have studied the photograph?
Will you recognise this man?
Hello, darling.
Hugo, you are late.
Did something happen?
You are always so curious and so beautiful.
Is it Schmitt?
He insists that I leave for
Germany in the morning.
So soon?
- I tried to talk to him.
But I didn't want to arouse his suspicions.
You must come with me.
I, to Germany?
You will be safe, darling.
And I'll be safe if you come.
But why? What have I to do with it?
Schmitt found out who Van Der Lyn is, what he did in Holland. He questioned me.
I told him that you and Van Der Lyn ..
That it was just a flirtation on your part.
But if you don't come.
They will say I lied to protect you.
And when I get to Germany.
I know their methods for getting so-called confessions ..
From men who try to conceal something.
Well there you are, you two.
I thought I would look in on the wheel of fortune.
One can always count on something interesting here.
Interesting things always happen at Estoril.
Won't you sit down please?
- Thank you.
I shall feel sad about leaving it.
You will find your compensations in Berlin I am sure and ..
So will your wife.
We were just discussing that.
She is going with you I assume.
Or .. Frau Von Mohr?
Am I mistaken?
No, Herr Schmitt.
I am going with Hugo.
Excellent.
Van Der Lyn.
Step away from the window.
Over there.
My men are all over the place, Van Der Lyn.
I didn't kill Jennings.
- It's useless to resist.
But I didn't kill him.
- Perhaps you didn't.
But I must arrest you.
The man who killed Jennings is a Nazi.
- I have my duty.
But you want to see justice done, don't you?
The man who killed Jennings is in there.
Who is he?
You'll know in a few minutes if we set a trap.
We?
- My friends.
Quintanilla?
Tonight is important, Captain. For me, for us. So many accounts to settle.
Your men are watching. I can't escape.
You ask me to neglect my duty.
I ask you to remember the Nazis.
Do you want to help them?
- I?
I have a sister in England.
She has three boys. Fine boys.
Her husband went to Norway to fight.
And he was beaten and tortured and killed.
So you too have an account to settle with the Nazis.
I have.
But I must arrest the murderer tonight.
You will, Captain. I promise that.
You know, when I first saw you at the airport ..
You told me you were going to England.
I was.
Are you still going to
England, Van Der Lyn?
Am I, Captain?
I couldn't miss the fireworks.
I've just set the trap to numbers 8-6-5.
I've told all our colleagues that our new agent to the low countries ..
The quite imaginary "Mr X" is waiting for us at the Grand Hotel.
Room 8-6-5.
The Nazis must make every effort ..
To stop Mr X from leaving.
The traitor in our midst must pass the number of the hotel room to them.
We leave here at one o'clock.
The informer has ten minutes in which to betray us.
They are all here.
The others are here, too.
Waiting for the number.
Look at them. Senor Garmand.
One hundred percent Nazi.
Baroness Von Klugge.
Austrian, born in Berlin.
She works with the Gestapo.
Professor Wingby from Zurich.
An authority on butterflies and sudden death.
They are not alone.
We have some men inside.
I know Mrs Drossersteine.
Good. Very good.
Van Der Lyn is here.
- I know that, Herr Schmitt.
Why don't you arrest him?
- Perhaps I will.
If the Lisbon police haven't got sense enough to arrest a criminal ..
Perhaps the Lisbon police have more sense than you give them credit, Herr Schmitt.
Number vingt-huit.
No-one has spoken to anyone else.
No written message has been passed.
They haven't much time.
All they have to do is convey a number.
Vingt-six noir.
They are all at the table.
Playing the numbers.
A better way for the traitor.
To inform the Nazis.
And by playing the numbers 8-6-5.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
Your luck is bad tonight.
No my dear, it is quite good.
Is it?
Time for us to go.
Is it one o'clock?
We gamblers have such a poor sense of time.
Justice played a very keen sense of time, Von Mohr.
Hugo, darling.
Will you be an angel and help me cash my chips?
Certainly, Baroness.
- I'm so wretched at figures.
Just a moment, Ricardo.
I will be right back.
The game is ended, Von Mohr.
Hugo!
Goodbye, Irene.
Sorry, Baroness.
This way, Von Mohr.
Come, my dear.
[ Gunshot! ]
[ Gunshot! ]
[ Gunshot! ]
[ Gunshot! ]
[ Gunshot! ]
[ Gunshot! ]
A Portuguese coin, Captain.
A very rare coin.
With an eagle.
That is the man who killed Jennings.
It will be light soon, Miguel.
We must get past the coastguard.
I'm glad you got here, my boy.
- Give me a moment, Miguel.
Darling.
Why can't Quintanilla send someone else in Jennings' place?
There is no-one else.
You heard what he said.
I'm frightened, Vincent.
Frightened.
Don't be.
Miguel is going to take me up the coast.
And our people will help me across the border.
But the Gestapo? They know you.
I know them.
- Vincent.
Oh, darling.
You will send word to me as soon as you can?
Of course I will.
But it may be weeks, months.
I'll be waiting to hear that you are safe.
Every moment I will be waiting.
And I will be waiting .. every moment.
To come back to you.
"And even now, so many months later."
"I can still see her face."
"Shining like a silver image."
"Through the darkñess in which I live and do my work."
"I can still see her loveliness."
"And I know we'll meet again in
Paris or London or in Berlin itself."
"When this horror is over."
"And through the long hours of the night."
"I keep clinging to the memories."
"And I remember."
"For the love of you .. I lost myself."
"And now I äm alone no more."
"But with God .. with love."
"With you."

NARRATOR:
At the forks of the Ohio stands an American city, a colossus of steel, whose mills and furnaces bring forth bone and sinew for a nation.
Not so long ago a lonely outpost guarded this very spot.
It was called Fort Pitt.
It stood at the edge of an unknown land, one of a line of forts that ran from Virginia to the Great Lakes, marking the end of the known and the beginning of the unknown.
Civilization was east of the Allegheny Mountains.
Conquest, opportunity and death lay to the west.
All around Fort Pitt was a vast forest, always beautiful, always dangerous.
Men came into it seeking many things.
Some for wealth, some for refuge some for freedom.
But to the Indian, all men came as invaders.
Wars for survival between red men and white threatened to sweep away these little forts.
Yet men kept coming west.
Some to build their own fortunes, even at the price of Indian wars.
Others to build a nation, even at the price of their own lives.
These are the unconquered, who push ever forward the frontiers of man's freedom.
But history sometimes chooses its heroes and heroines from strange places.
For one, the hope of freedom was born at Old Bailey in London, in the year 1763.
Prisoner at the bar.
You have been found guilty of the most heinous crime, of murder.
It is my duty to pass upon you the sentence which the law enjoins.
Abigail Martha Hale, the sentence of this court is...
My lord.
Woman, be still.
My lord, hear me.
My brother was ill of fever when the press-gang broke in to take him.
I helped him fight to be free.
In that fight, an impressing officer of the Royal Navy was killed.
My brother was killed too, my lord.
The prisoner is here to receive sentence.
The sentence of this court is that you be taken from this place to a lawful prison and thence to a place of execution.
And that you there be hanged by the neck until you are dead.
And may the Lord have mercy on your soul.
Come.
One word more, by the gracious generosity of Our Sovereign Lord,
King George the Third, it is in my power to offer you the King's mercy.
Instead of execution, you may be transported to His Majesty's colonies in North America.
Not to die, my lord?
And to serve not less than 14 years as an indentured slave, to be sold at auction to the highest bidder.
Slavery in the colonies or the gallows here.
Speak up, girl, which is it to be?
Slavery, my lord.
Get the blood in your cheeks.
You'll fetch a better price at Norfolk tomorrow.
Mr. Leach, you won't sell me away from my husband, will you?
You'll sell according to your indentures.
Seven year, l'll be free and get me a bit of land.
And maybe even a strong wife.
LEACH: Get along, get along.
Me, l'll get me bought by a nice rich widow and marry myself free.
I ain't a rich widow, but l'm willing.
Ain't you got a wife already, Tom?
Wife. I'm serving time for all four of them.
Break your ranks and save your shanks.
Our land of opportunity.
Jeremy, how old shall l look in 14 years?
Fourteen years older, of course.
LEACH: Here, here, have a care there.
Have a care.
MAN: Hold onto the slate.
MAN 2: Make fast to the pin rail.
MAN 3: Ease that on the deck.
And at ease.
Some sort of chopping instrument.
LEACH: Stand by your braces.
Let go of the last one.
Jeremy, put it back before the owner sees you.
GARTH: The owner has seen you.
Hand me that tomahawk.
Tomahawk?
I was just remarking to this young lady...
Convicts should know the punishment for stealing.
Captain.
Well, he didn't steal it.
No, well, perhaps...
Who are you?
My daughter, sir.
The devoted daughter of Jeremy John Love.
Jeremy, l'm not your daughter.
No, not in fact, but in spirit.
You seem a gentleman of discernment, sir.
Tell me, can you always spot the queen?
I believe so.
Excellent, I've heard...
No, no.
Don't go away, my dear.
Jeremy, please.
You show a taste for entertainment, sir, entertainment with a dash of risk.
Well?
Well, sir, observe your queen is now between two knaves, thus.
But can you tell me where the queen is hiding now?
And if l do?
The stake is yours to name, sir.
A pound.
A pound it is.
Put it up.
Oh, well, l seldom carry large sums of money upon my...
You have other assets.
Perhaps a kiss from your daughter-in-spirit.
Jeremy, l won't be...
Keep your hair on, he can't win.
MAN: Man the mizzen top-sail sheets.
A golden sovereign.
Gallant risk, sir.
Now, sir.
Now, can you tell me where the queen is hiding?
Yes. Up the sleeve of a cheat who is about to get 30 lashes.
Thirty?
You wouldn't have a man of his age whipped.
His age hasn't improved his honesty or yours.
Slave driver.
Wait.
I'll give you the kiss.
You're not giving it, l won it.
MAN: He's got her anchored all right.
Another cheat.
I paid you.
You can do better.
Slave driver.
Yes.
Yes, Mr. Garth.
This woman for sale?
Yes, Mr. Garth.
They're all for sale.
Indentured servant?
No, sir. Felon.
Felon?
It ain't deep in her character, Mr. Garth.
She's good manners, gentle, sweet.
Fit for all kinds of housework.
I'll buy her.
I won't be sold to this man.
What's her price?
Mr. Leach, the judge said public auction.
LEACH: Hold your tongue.
She's right.
We'll have an auction right here.
Gentlemen, would any of you care to bid against me for his girl?
MAN: Not me.
I don't hold much with slavery.
That red hair could change a man's mind.
I'm starting at £20.
£20 is bid for
Abigail Martha Hale.
Offering 14 years of servitude.
Let them see your face, girl.
Going once, going twice.
For the third and last time...
HOLDEN: And sixpence.
FERGUS: Pardon?
Man, you've an eye like an eagle.
But l dinnae ken your way of throwing.
Did you say something, sir?
Yes, l said, "And sixpence."
Lend me your bodkin, Fergus.
It's an Indian knife throw.
Captain Holden has a reputation for joking.
Make your sale.
Oh, yes, sir.
Yes, sir, Mr. Garth.
Going to Mr. Garth for...
You heard my bid?
LEACH: Yes, sir,
£20 and sixpence.
Would your humor desert you,
Captain Holden, at £50?
MAN 1: £50, did you hear that?
MAN 2: What do you know!
£50 for this likely servant maid.
Strong and willing.
Do l hear another bid?
And sixpence.
LEACH: And sixpence.
£50 and sixpence.
LEACH: Do l hear £55?
Cash on the barrel.
Cash on the barrel.
Try another.
£50 and sixpence, l'm bid.
And sixpence.
£60 and sixpence...
That's better.
He must be very rich or very interested.
He hasn't even looked at me.
£60 and sixpence for this rare gem.
Smile, you little scut.
Do l hear another bid?
GARTH: Yes.
And sixpence.
LEACH: It's £65 and sixpence.
Hey, Chris, the game's getting a wee bit rough.
Here's your coat.
Do l hear £70? You will not see the likes of this maid in all His Majesty's colonies.
You seem to want this girl.
The Ohio country won't be a healthy place for a white woman when the Indians get these toys you're bringing them.
Usual trade goods.
Usual?
What you've got aboard the brig Minerva and the ship Paragon?
It might pay you to mind your own business.
I found that out from one of your Senecas on the Catawba Trail.
You met one of the bad shots.
That one will never learn to shoot any better.
And sixpence.
I hear £70 and another sixpence.
Have a closer look, gentlemen.
Skin soft as satin.
Cheerful as a meadowlark.
MAN 1: Muskets.
MAN 2: That's guns in there.
They're all new.
Even this ship is loaded with your usual trade goods.
Indians don't trade furs for Bibles.
They don't trade for bond slaves, either.
What are your plans for her?
Field hand on your plantation?
I apologize for Mr. Garth, ma'am.
In Virginia we use dirt to grow tobacco and bury our dead.
We don't like your kind of dirt, Mr. Garth.
MAN 3: Watch out.
No, gentlemen, no.
Not on my ship.
You are quite right,
Captain Brooks.
His purse.
Perhaps someday he'll come west of the Alleghenies.
Dueling code is very different in the Ohio country.
£70 and sixpence is bid, gentlemen, for this dainty little package.
Look at her slender form, the tilt of her head.
You, sir, would you care to put in a bid, sir?
No, thank you.
I've never had to buy trouble.
Here's my bid,
£103. A Turk's ransom.
Jeremy, l'm frightened.
A hundred quid would frighten the wings off an angel.
And sixpence.
I'll double that tomorrow at Norfolk.
Cash on the barrel, Mr. Garth.
Is that yours?
No, mine's in the Captain's strongbox.
He's right. Cash is the law.
Make the sale.
£103 and sixpence, once, twice.
Sold to Captain Holden for £103...
And sixpence.
Sorry, Mr. Garth.
Quite a price for a rose of Old Bailey.
Here's your bonnet.
Have the bill of sale ready in the morning.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
My dear Captain, allow me to present my ward.
I hope you had a very pleasant voyage, ma'am.
Well...
Chris...
Chris, a loony man would seem wise alongside of you.
Why did ye do it?
Garth is bad medicine,
Fergus.
She'll be safer with him than with your promised bride tomorrow when she sees yon red-headed purchase you just made.
Aye. Diana.
MAN: Land ho!
MAN 1: Haul away on the...
MAN 2: Clear tire.
Clear tire.
Your longboat's making fast, sir.
Does it carry a young lady armed with a musket?
The ship's agent brought this aboard, sir.
Thank you.
Oh, will you have my luggage lowered to the longboat?
Certainly, sir.
From the impatient bride?
No, from John Fraser.
Pittsburgh blacksmith.
Pittsburgh?
Little village in Virginia.
Listen to this.
"Trouble's busting everywhere.
"When you get yours, if you ain't killed nobody,
"meet me at the Peakestown Fair."
John must have dipped his pen in applejack.
He can't have known you're getting married.
If you'll sign
Mistress Hale's papers, sir.
Whose? Oh.
Have the notary certify these, then give them to the girl.
Yes, sir. She's on deck.
If he likes sugarplums, you look just like one.
He's probably married, with six children.
Stop babbling.
Just get him to buy me and l'll have you riding in your own carriage.
Love accomplishes all things, my dear.
For instance, for luck.
Jeremy, it's a gold piece.
Uh-huh.
King Charles double guinea.
It was given to my mother by a prince of the blood.
There he is.
Well, go to him. Go to him.
Keep your gold in your fist, your tongue in your cheek, and don't be too forward, and not too backward, either.
MAN: Pick up, you're slacking that line.
Good morning, Captain Holden.
Good morning, Miss...
Well, l'm all ready.
Yes. I see you are.
Bend your bonnets.
Do we go now?
I'm sorry, Miss...
Abby.
Miss Abby.
But l'm not taking you.
You're free.
But didn't you buy me?
Oh, yes, l bought you...
MAN: Watch yourself.
Stand clear, you.
And now l've set you free.
ABBY: You mean really free?
HOLDEN: Yes. Leach will give you your papers.
I'm very grateful, but l won't accept my freedom.
You won't?
I owe you £103 and sixpence and l intend to work for you until it's paid.
Oh, not for me.
You're much too pretty to pass the porridge on my honeymoon.
Your honeymoon? But...
You're married?
I will be within the week.
Goodbye, Abby.
Then why did you buy me?
What?
Why did you buy me?
Oh, to see if sixpence could poison a snake.
Oh. You bought me because you don't like him.
Well, here's a lucky piece to brighten your opinion of me.
It's a King Charles double guinea.
What did l do with it?
Oh, l see.
I didn't steal it.
I see your hand was quicker than my eye.
Keep it.
More freight for the longboat.
MAN: Aye, aye, sir.
Hold tight.
Take it easy, men.
You've got a passenger on it.
Easy on that cargo sling.
Keep it clear of the shroud.
Chris.
HOLDEN: No.
Doesn't look like it to me.
DIANA:
Who's the girl with him?
Don't know. Very pretty.
MAN 1: Flip the toddle.
Clear that gear.
MAN 2: On deck.
Overhaul the cabling.
Batten the hooks down.
Pull the hatch ladder.
Watch your footing on the gangway.
There's Martha.
There she is.
Goodbye, George.
See you in Jamestown.
Land never looked better.
WOMAN: I'm so glad to be home, l could walk on air.
Hello, Bone.
I'll sign these later.
Very good, sir.
What'd you bring from Pittsburgh?
Two wagons of this kind of stuff.
Injuns ain't hunting.
What's wrong?
Gun trading's been stopped.
Who stopped it?
Indian Commissioner.
He wants you to meet him at Peakestown.
Looks like the pot's started to boil.
What's Pontiac say?
Says the Delawares will join and the Shawnees and the Chippewas.
He ain't sure about the Wyandots.
They'll come in when their powder horns are full.
Steady there, steady.
Back that tray up,
'tis powder.
Hang on.
MAN: Take up the slack in the quarter line.
Get up, Leach, and let me sign these.
Yes, sir, Mr. Garth.
Wicked waste of money.
By you?
Captain Holden setting that girl free.
Yes, very wasteful.
How would you like to sell all your bond slaves to Mr. Bone, here?
Bond slaves?
I got no use for...
Say, £400?
Well... Why, sold.
All except...
Except no one.
But that girl is free.
You're sailing next week.
Who'd know?
Double-selling a bond slave is a hanging offense.
Here's a mink for you, so the rope won't scratch your neck.
Mr. Leach, Captain Holden said you'd give me my papers.
Well...
He said that?
Yes, he set me free.
Free? That's carrying a joke too far.
What is?
First he pretends to buy the girl, then he pretends to set her free.
He did buy me.
If he bought a girl as pretty as you, he'd never set her free.
Mr. Leach?
I'm sure the gentleman meant no harm.
But he'd have told me.
He didn't have the courage.
It is rather a grim joke.
You bought me.
No. Bone.
Where're you going?
He'll sell the others at Peakestown Fair.
You're not for sale.
I won't go with him.
You'll go all right.
I ain't bad company.
Get the furs aboard and the slaves ashore.
Start west before night.
What's the matter, Jason?
You're not singing.
I guess there ain't much singing left in me,
Master Chris.
Just thinking.
You're thinking, too, Diana?
Why? Haven't l been talking?
Yes, you've been talking, but about dogs and colts and cotton.
About most everything except us.
Well, the mosquitoes are glad l'm back anyway.
Oh, l'm glad you're back, Chris.
So is your brother, Harold.
Poor Hal.
Poor?
Well, we can't both have you, Diana.
Chris, when l look into your eyes, l don't see myself there.
You must be a little blind.
I see horizons, ranges of uncrossed mountains, the unknown.
You belong to that, Chris, the way an eagle belongs to the sky.
But l'm different.
No, you're not.
Let me tell you what l see in your eyes.
No.
You won't like the view.
It doesn't go beyond the walls of Holden Hall.
What are you trying to say?
Something l've been trying to tell you in everything but words.
Hal and l are married.
You married Holden Hall and £20,000 a year.
I married the things l want, Chris.
Where are we, Jason?
Just passing Blount's Landing,
Master Chris.
Put me ashore.
Chris, come home and meet your brother.
I don't care to inherit the brand of Cain.
He set aside £20,000 for you.
I paid £100 for a little thief aboard ship.
I think you were overpriced.
I was never yours to sell.
I guess you're right.
Your wedding present's in those trunks.
There's a green dress with all the fluff to go with it, designed by Forgel,
Madame Pompadour's dressmaker.
Just right for you.
Cost £187.
Here are the keys.
You'll find someone more worthy than l am to wear them.
Some squaw, west of the Alleghenies.
Swing those trunks ashore.
Yes, sir, Master Chris.
Oh, Chris, you'll forget me in no time.
You'll forget that in no time.
Just pile that stuff right here.
I'll get a wagon.
Yes, sir, Master Chris.
Take me with you,
Master Chris.
You're not mine to take.
I'll miss you, Jason.
You taught me most of what l know.
You might have taught me a little more about women.
Goodbye, old friend.
MAN: Now, while balancing himself on one foot with nothing between him and the ground but this knife-sharp wire, he will cut in two a paper tube held in the mouths of these fair young damsels.
Don't worry if he misses, he told me they were two-faced.
This gentleman...
Hi, there, John Fraser.
Ain't you a long way from Pittsburgh?
Five days and 150 miles uphill both ways.
...that far-famed monster of Madagascar, the one-horned Boukabekabus.
Two, sir.
Thank you.
With the hide of a bull, the head of a unicorn, and the wisdom of a prophet, he has astonished the crowned heads of Europe and now can be seen for three days only right here in Peakestown.
Hey, blacksmith, think you could hammer shoes on that?
Pittsburgh, he'd be a house pet.
Cider. Cider.
Fresh, sweet cider.
Hard as a rock.
Cider here.
...hazard and risk for your education and recreation.
Neptune's loveliest daughter, she has the face of a female and the body of a fish.
She has lured, my friends, many a brave sea captain to his destruction.
Now, you with the spinning wheel there, don't go away. Come on in.
Come in, folks.
You've never seen anything like it before.
You'll never see anything like it again.
Scales on her tail and...
Thank you very much, sir.
Scales on her tail and seaweed in her hair.
The greatest exhibit at the Peakestown Fair.
HOLDEN:
You can't take her home to your wife, John Fraser.
Chris. Chris Holden.
I've been looking all over for you.
By gollys, how are you?
Did you expect to find me in there with the mermaid?
Aw, shucks. I wasn't...
Pile your loot in the back and climb aboard.
Say, ain't you traveling kind of fancy?
What did you bring back, the London Bridge?
Well, a green dress for a bride and women's doodads, which l expect to swap for trade goods.
Well, get over.
Yep. I heard about her.
Chris, you wasn't cut out to marry no Tidewater lady and just rusticate.
I don't know what the good Lord was about when he made a female out of a perfectly good rib.
We'll tote your doodads over to Fort Pitt.
Officers' wives will pay more for them.
That's quite a speech for you.
But you didn't bring me out here just to tell me that.
What's going on?
Trouble, Chris.
You can smell it as far as a flea can smell a dog.
Keep this covered.
Where did you get this?
Off an Injun that aimed a mite too high.
The Indian Commissioner seen it?
Sir William?
No, not yet.
I kept it for you.
MAN: Going twice.
Sold to the gent in the butternut vest for £14.
Pay the notary, mister.
He'll give you your papers.
Put your hat on, lad.
It's your sweat l'm buying, not your spirit.
You don't have to bow and scrape to me.
Take this one for £1.
He'll keep the crows off your field.
All right, come along.
Let's see.
Say, you. Yeah.
I'm looking to buy a wife for my son.
Oh, wife.
Here, young lady.
A buxom lass from Lancashire.
She can outwork a horse.
Kind and loving as a dove.
Made a little mistake, that's all.
She'll make your son a fine, affectionable wife.
What do you say, Son?
Joshua, what's the matter with you?
Ma, buy me that one.
She ain't for sale.
Get back on the wagon.
Why did you tell me to stand here and smile?
For bait. Get going.
BONE: Now, lady, what's your bid?
WOMAN: Let me talk to this girl private.
Look, Abby, there's Captain Holden going into the tavern.
BONE: Here you are, folks, this young fella's as strong as a goat and smart as a fox.
I'd rather look at the devil himself.
BONE: Takes to work like a duck to water.
What do you say?
Colonel Washington is here too, Chris.
I thought maybe you and him might get the Indian Commissioner to...
What's biting you?
You ain't going to buy a bond slave, are you?
That girl looks like one l've already bought.
It is, Captain.
The moment you left, she came to me.
I use her for drawing crowds.
And l thought she was only a thief.
Hello, Chris,
Mr. Garth. Mr. Lee.
Colonel Washington.
You said to fetch him, George.
You know the Indian Commissioner,
Sir William Johnson.
How are you, Captain?
Sir William.
I haven't seen you since the Indians chased us off Braddock's Field.
What's the matter?
You look as though they'd just caught up with you.
Mr. Garth was just enlightening me on the manners and morals of bond slaves.
My wife was a bond slave, you know, Captain Holden.
One of my teachers was an indentured convict, Chris.
Fine man. Never could teach me to spell.
Coming?
Yes, sir.
I'll join you inside,
Sir William.
BUYER: Fourteen.
Only £14 for as handy a couple as you'll find this side of Cape Henry.
I don't want both.
I bid £14 for the man.
The woman is yours, mister, for £6 more.
A woman's no good in my fields.
Oh, Ben, hold me close.
I'm frightened.
Who'll say £20 for them both? You?
MAN: Not me.
You?
Then it's £14 for the man.
Sold to this gentleman here.
Now, what am l bid for the woman?
Don't sell us apart,
Mr. Bone.
You'd be apart if you was serving your terms in prison.
Now, what am l bid for this?
Who'll say six for the woman?
It's not human to sell a man away from his wife, Mr. Bone.
Shut your yap.
Don't buy him alone, sir.
Please.
I don't buy women.
But she's his wife.
Keep quiet.
You never said they're man and wife, fella.
They're slaves, ain't they?
I'm not breaking up a family.
The girl's right.
Get down there.
Don't whip her because of me, Mr. Bone.
Keep out of this.
Don't worry about me, Maggie.
Get on down there.
Take over, Art.
Don't go away, gentlemen.
Don't go away.
Come on, we can see over the top.
Here's a good, strong field hand for your plantation.
Strong of back.
Strong of arm.
What am l bid.
Do l hear £10?
You'll get it now.
Please don't.
MAN: Hold your tongue.
You've been asking for this.
It's time to learn who's your master.
Maybe it is, Bone.
She spiked a sale.
Loose her.
MAN: Ain't they gonna tan her?
WOMAN:
They're taking her down.
Fix your dress in the tent, Abby.
Are you out of your mind?
You said to gentle her.
Flogging collects a crowd.
Chris Holden's here.
Has he seen her?
Yes.
Sell what you can and get going for Pittsburgh.
He hurt you.
I'm all right.
I'm sorry about this.
Why did you stop him?
I hoped you would forgive and forget.
Slavery hasn't taught me forgiveness.
Or gratitude.
I'm grateful for what you've done.
I can do more.
Would you help me get away?
Where?
There isn't a town in these colonies big enough to hide that red hair of yours.
Some try for the west.
The west?
You've never seen a doe dragged down by a wolf pack or a white woman when an Indian war party had done with her.
You don't know what freedom's worth until you lose it.
Isn't worth much against a Shawnee torture stake.
Hanging in England is quick, Abby.
Is it worse than
14 years of bondage with Bone?
It doesn't have to be bondage or Bone.
GARTH: Hannah.
Mamaultee bring word from my father.
Well?
Guyasuta say to Garth,
Pontiac at Wolf Creek.
Hannah, look after this girl.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
White one. Pretty.
Who are you?
A bond slave.
He no look at you like bond slave.
His.
Who are you?
His wife.
For years, gentlemen, l've had the Indians' friendship.
I sometimes think that only an Irishman can really understand the red man.
Now, maybe l'm getting old, but l still know the signs.
There's a cloud of trouble coming down over the Ohio with the sound of war drums in it.
I've heard them before.
And l know that closing your ears to them can cost you your scalp.
What's behind it,
Sir William?
Mr. Carroll, when old enemies like the Ottawas, the Shawnees, and the Senecas meet together in council, the thread's off the bobbin.
Perhaps just a meeting to bury the hatchet.
In somebody's skull.
Do you think there's war in this, Colonel Washington?
The whole frontier's a powder keg.
And those two gentlemen were almost the fuse.
Mr. Mason and Mr. Dixon, the London astronomers, have been running a survey to settle Pennsylvania's boundary line and her claim to Pittsburgh and the Ohio country.
Pittsburgh, gentlemen, is in Virginia.
You can see for yourselves.
But, Brother Lee,
Pittsburgh is in Pennsylvania and the whole
Ohio Territory is...
Mine.
Yours, Mr. Garth?
Yes.
I'm no surveyor, gentlemen, but the Allegheny runs here and the Monongahela.
Here's Pittsburgh.
Colonel Washington wants this territory for Virginia.
Mr. Andrews thinks it's in Pennsylvania.
But l hold deeds to it from the Indians.
The Indians cannot deed lands, Mr. Garth.
Not by law.
Whose law?
Pennsylvania's? Virginia's?
The King's law.
The King's law moves with the King's muskets.
And there are very few King's muskets west of the Alleghenies.
There's only bear, beaver and muskrat, and they don't need boundary lines.
Mr. Garth.
The very heavens need boundary lines.
Mr. Mason and l have measured the distance from Earth to Mars.
There are no savages between
Earth and Mars, Mr. Dixon.
There are 10,000 red hot ones between here and the Ohio.
And it's no place for surveyors or settlers.
You're there.
I rule it.
You can't rule part of Pennsylvania.
Nor Virginia.
Nobody rules it until this survey is completed.
And l regret to inform you that the Mason and Dixon Line has been stopped.
Stopped?
When?
How could it be stopped?
WASHINGTON: Mr. Mason.
Stopped rather thoroughly at Dunkard's Creek by a band of painted aborigines.
It must have been a hunting party.
Why should Indians stop a survey?
Why?
To hide the movement of war parties across the Ohio trail.
ALL: War parties?
The Senecas, the Ottawas,
Delawares, Shawnees...
You mean a general uprising?
MAN: Have they powder and lead?
War parties?
Is that possible,
Sir William?
So possible that we have forbidden the sale of firearms to the Indians.
But, Sir William, no one could bring those tribes together.
I think there is someone,
Mr. Garth.
Who?
Pontiac.
Pontiac?
The Ottawa chief?
Pontiac's a friend of the white man.
Which white man?
Those who stay east of the Alleghenies.
Mr. Garth has just been in England trying to get a law passed prohibiting settlement west of the Allegheny.
He wants the whole fur empire to himself.
Settlers will never be safe west of the mountains.
Why, their homes are there.
Their graves will be there, unless you call them back.
Mr. Garth.
Those people will never abandon a settlement like Pittsburgh.
I'm sorry,
Colonel Washington.
I know you selected that site yourself, but after all, a fort at the end of the earth, guarding nothing, on a couple of useless rivers.
That triangle of land, sir, may be the most vital spot in this country.
Oh, my dear Colonel.
I visited John Fraser's forge there once.
And saw...
Coal and iron, that's what he saw.
Pittsburgh's like a hen sitting on more coal than she can hatch in a thousand years.
Cook the iron with that coal and what've you got? Steel.
Why, that town'll sprout into a city of maybe four or five thousand folks.
Don't laugh, gentlemen.
John's a good gunsmith and we may need more guns than words to build a future.
I've given my opinion.
If you ignore it, l'll wash my hands clean of the whole matter.
I hope they stay clean.
Captain Holden.
Mr. Garth knows the Indians.
He ought to.
He's married to Guyasuta's daughter and is a blood brother of the Senecas.
Watch your words, man.
Didn't you exchange blood with Guyasuta?
Yes.
That's why the Senecas trade with me rather than with Crawford or Croghan.
My trading posts would be the first to go up in the smoke of an Indian war.
Then why did you send hundreds of muskets from England?
Thousands of flints, tons of bar lead and powder to...
Captain Holden, what are you suggesting?
Captain Holden is somewhat bitter toward me because of a pretty bond slave aboard ship.
Seems he's lost his famous luck with the ladies.
You still haven't explained the shipments of arms, Mr. Garth.
Explain them?
I deny them.
Any other information you'd like?
Yes.
In case of an Indian war, which side would you be on?
I've killed men for less than that.
For much less.
Captain Holden, l suggest that you control yourself and leave Mr. Garth to control the Indians.
Control?
No one can control the Indians, once they've sent around the red belt of war.
But if you close the Ohio to settlement, the war belt will never be passed.
It has been passed.
What?
When?
MAN: That's hard to believe.
How do you know?
John Fraser took this off an Ottawa near Venango.
Crossed tomahawks.
The war belt.
A war belt!
That otter there is Pontiac's sign.
On its way to Guyasuta.
Mr. Garth's blood brother.
Colonel Bouquet, that belt makes it a matter for the army.
I have no army.
What? Why?
The Black Watch is just in from the Caribbean, fever among the men.
Do you expect miracles?
We cannot be ready for four months.
Four months?
There won't be a live settler west of the mountains.
Then pull your settlers back.
Or stop the war before it breaks.
How?
By sending peace belts to all the chiefs.
Peace belts?
Yes.
Why not, Sir William?
Calling a council.
It's worked before.
Pontiac'd make buzzard bait out of the man hat carried them.
No.
No, l believe the peace belts could get through if they were carried by an expert woodsman such as Captain Holden.
Holden?
It'd be murder, Chris.
Why?
He knows the Indians, he knows the trails, and he's a dead shot.
What do you say,
Captain Holden?
I'll take them, Sir William.
That was a brave thing you just said, Captain.
I'll provide the scouts,
Captain.
I guess l'll provide my own scouts, Mr. Garth.
Where'll you be?
Wolf Creek with Guyasuta and Pontiac.
BONE: Get back in the wagon.
How soon can you start?
Tonight, if John Fraser gets me buckskins and a rifle.
The peace belts will not be ready for three days.
How will you go?
By Nemacolin's Path.
I'll take charge of the pathfinding.
You're not going, John.
Now, Chris, there's no reason...
Your wife would skin me alive.
You're going to drive my gear to Pittsburgh.
Captain, your mission is confidential.
If you run into trouble, you cannot tell the military or we'll have this war on our hands before we can fight it.
Colonel Bouquet is right.
Action by the military is the one thing that would instantly unite all the tribes behind Pontiac.
You'll be playing a Ione hand, Chris.
You might have use for this compass.
It's not Boston Common you'll be crossing.
WASHINGTON:
Indeed, it's not.
Headstones are the only milestones on Nemacolin's Path.
I haven't seen a bird or a wild critter in an hour.
Me, neither.
It don't smell right.
Joe.
Clean through the heart.
He's dead.
I've got the belts.
Come on. Save your scalp.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Dan, grab that branch.
This dang tree needs pruning.
My powder horn.
My powder horn, he's seen it.
Well, that's one good Injun.
Ottawa.
What's Ottawas doing in Seneca country?
Ask Garth.
No time for souvenirs, come on.
I reckon we shook them off.
You can't ever shake off an Indian.
I left my wind about six miles back.
I ought to have my brain dusted.
With that skull ax?
A few days ago, this tomahawk was on a ship with Garth.
He didn't waste much time passing them around.
Garth knew these belts were going through and he knew we were carrying them.
That's why Joe Lavat's back there with an arrow through him.
You still delivering peace belts?
We've got another job to do first, Dan.
Killing Garth, l guess.
I guess.
That's my job, Dan.
We'll split up and if l don't get through to Pittsburgh, the job is yours.
Let's get going.
I'm traveling over
Chestnut Ridge.
I'll cross Turkey Foot to the Old Braddock Road.
Nothing ever travels that but ghosts.
Be sure you ain't one of them.
Thanks.
I'll meet you on Coal Hill above Fort Pitt before noon.
Before noon.
You want this compass?
No.
I'd get lost.
Well, so long, Captain.
So long, Fur-face.
Dan McCoy with a compass.
Hang onto your powder horn this time.
What're you drinking?
Rum.
So am I.
Hey.
Well, don't swallow the cup.
I won't.
Five fingers of rum to drink to the King's birthday.
Go on and be nice to them.
None of that that trade slop you feed the savages.
MAN: Hey, get that jug of rum over here.
Ale.
Hey, you're pretty.
Ain't been here long, have you?
You've been here too long.
What's your name, dearie?
Corn whiskey.
Come here, Corn Whiskey.
Oh, don't. No, please.
I ain't gonna hurt you.
I just want...
Better you spilled blood.
Scrub it up before Bone beats the daylights out of you.
Come on. Come on or Bone'll charge you for a bath.
Hey, what about my liquor?
MAN 1: Lap it up off the floor, Jim.
MAN 2: Jake, you owe me one for this.
JAKE: There's plenty more at the bar.
Why you no run away?
Run away, Hannah? Where?
Where he no find you.
Garth?
He come here tonight for you.
Spilling that grog will add a year onto your time.
But l didn't...
Get out there.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Here's your bottle.
Keep out of sight.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Them Indians won't trade for nothing but gunpowder.
Give it to them.
It's breaking the law.
Give it to them.
And so, gentlemen, you see a mink skin.
But observe.
The mink skin is no longer a mink skin.
It has become a silver button.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
(BONE SPEAKING
NATIVE AMERICAN LANGUAGE)
What's the ruckus?
Well, this aborigine here claims there were five little minks.
See for yourself there are only four.
One, two, three, four.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Why, you worthless, lard-bellied, thieving...
Trying to start a massacre?
We've got enough trouble.
Some more just came in the door.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Keep scrubbing.
Get along.
Looking for somebody?
Garth trade here?
Some.
Where is he?
How do l know?
This Ottawa knows.
No, he just come in from up north.
Northeast, maybe from Chestnut Ridge.
What of it?
He's a friendly Indian.
He is? Then, why is he wearing a dead man's powder horn?
He ain't.
Powder horns are easy to get.
Not this one.
Get Mr. Bone a drink.
From over there.
This Indian killed Dan McCoy to get a leather pouch.
Where is it?
I don't know.
But if you came here looking for trouble, you've found it.
Keep both hands on that drink, Mr. Bone.
Where's the pouch?
Is this what you're looking for?
Shut your...
Bone.
Yes, that's it.
You've certainly come down in the world.
So has my opinion of you.
Is this Mr. Garth's hospitality?
You're not going anywhere.
Keep your hands flat on the bar.
I figured you'd do better with your freedom.
What freedom?
Freedom to be beaten with a whip, to serve and to scrub and milk, from sunup to midnight?
Then crawl into a cornhusk bed too tired to sleep or even cry?
Why don't you quit?
A slave can't quit.
Slave?
But l set you free.
You never set her free.
No. He bought me and tonight he's selling me to Garth.
Shut up, you.
Keep both hands on that drink, Mr. Bone.
Tonight, huh?
Get your things, Abby.
I haven't any things.
You have two feet, get up on them and bring the pouch.
I'll break your arms if...
No, you won't.
I bought her and if she's not free, she's mine.
Get behind me, Abby.
Now start for the door.
Art. Jake.
ART: Coming, boss.
JAKE: I'll get him.
I'll put a hole through the first thing in this room that moves.
Slave stealing means hanging.
You've got the right neck for it, Mr. Bone. Get your hand back on that drink.
Garth will be looking for you.
That's the idea.
That one was for Dan McCoy.
There's another one here for Joe Lavat if anybody wants it.
Get that rifle and get him at gunpoint.
We'll get him, boss.
Where to?
Fraser's forge, and don't pick my pocket on the way.
Hello, John.
Chris, what are you doing here?
You must have been traveling on a broomstick.
Sit down and let your breath catch up with you.
I thought you was on a job for Colonel Washington.
I am.
Well, what happened?
An Ottawa.
What's that?
A lady.
Thank you.
Did you bring her here to get shod?
Well, she cast a shoe.
John Fraser.
Yeah.
Where's that pressing iron you were heating for me?
Scalping's too good for you.
Standing there lollygagging with every Tom...
Land o'mighty, Chris!
Well, Half-Pint.
Let me look at you.
(EXCLAIMS) Pretty.
Oh, Chris.
Right in front of my own husband.
What'd you come here for?
King's birthday ball?
I didn't know he was having one, but l came to dance it with you.
You're the biggest liar ever crossed the Alleghenies, except my John.
Chris, you're making me dizzy.
Stop prancing and tell me the truth.
Well, l tell you l came to trap a skunk.
Appears to me you trapped a chipmunk.
I beg your pardon,
Mistress Abigail, l want you to meet the love of my life,
Mrs. John Fraser.
Your servant, ma'am.
Well, she's nice-mannered.
She's the wench from the tavern.
Garth'll nail your hide to the barn door for this.
He owns everything in that tavern. What'd you bring her here for?
To give her a bath.
Save us, what next?
What for you want to give her a bath?
Because she's dirty.
Look at her hair, look at her clothes, look at her...
Well, look at her.
She's stolen goods, Chris.
Ain't your place to wash other people's belongings.
Scrub her clean enough and even Garth won't know her.
You're just plumb crazy.
Where's that luggage of mine you brought from Peakestown?
She can't go to the ball looking like that.
The King's birthday ball? Me?
He is crazy.
I believe you're right.
You're gonna be scrubbed so clean that you're gonna look like new.
Not by you, l'm not.
Now your back.
Oh, stop wiggling, child.
I have soap in my mouth.
Well, keep it shut.
Skin's real pink when you get down to it.
More water.
This ought to fit.
She's about Diana's size.
I won't go to the ball.
You can't drag me around in your wife's old clothes.
Washing a slave girl ain't gonna stop no Injun bust-out.
Washing this one might.
Hey, what's this?
I don't know.
It's nothing for a bachelor.
Where's that water?
Bachelor? He's not a bachelor.
Oh, yes, he is, and he's gonna stay one.
You didn't get married?
No.
My uniform's in the other trunk.
Where is it, John?
In here.
He didn't get married.
Lucky escape for some woman. Stand up.
Chris, the whole frontier's just ready to bust wide open and here you are traipsing around with a little...
John, did you ever catch a bear with honey?
SERVANT:
Mr. And Mrs. George Carter.
I'll be right back, Carl.
All right, Sara.
Name, please.
Not me. Everybody knows me.
All right, sir.
Howdy, Carl.
I'm ready.
I'm hankering for a dance.
WOMAN: Oh, hello, Sally.
Having a good time?
Oh, Captain Ecuyer.
Every lady in Pittsburgh is simply perishing for a dance with you.
My dancing was ended by an old wound.
In the heart, Captain Ecuyer?
Unfortunately, a trifle lower.
I left my dancing days in
Switzerland. Captain Steele dances for me here.
I'll hold you to that, sir.
Look.
That's a vulgar noise,
Captain, but l agree with it.
Captain Christopher Holden,
Mistress Abigail Hale.
MAN: Abigail Hale?
Why are they staring so?
You look like Venus emerging from an emerald sea.
What a heavenly gown.
What an angel in it.
How would l look in a dress like that, Jim?
You'll never know, Ma.
How do you do?
I know you by reputation,
Captain Holden.
What brings you to Pittsburgh?
A lady from London, sir.
Mistress Abigail Hale,
Captain Ecuyer,
Commandant of Fort Pitt.
A charming breath of England to sweeten our wilderness.
My second in command,
Captain Steele.
Captain.
Your servant, ma'am.
I'm sure we've met before.
I think not, Captain, l've been very closely guarded.
We crossed the Atlantic on the same ship. She was allowed very little freedom.
You're still a riddle to me,
Miss Hale. Perhaps this dance will help solve it.
I'll solve this one,
Captain.
Outmaneuvered, Captain, huh?
John Fraser, l believe you're going to faint.
Get me to the punch bowl,
Mother.
Fine feathers certainly make a difference.
In this case, the bird improves the feathers.
You're quite a burst of plumage yourself,
Captain Holden.
You mean birds of a feather?
No, you think l'm a thief.
And you thought l was a liar.
I've seen that girl somewhere.
Must have been heaven.
GUARD 1: Post number two.
GUARD 2: Post number three.
GUARD 3: Post number four.
GUARD 4: Post number five.
All's well, isn't it?
Too quiet.
You seem to be watching for something.
Watchfulness isn't a bad thing, Abby, when you are at the edge of the end of the world.
Why? What's there?
Forests and savages.
The end of the present, the beginning of the future.
The beginning of the future,
Captain Holden?
Chris.
Why did you really come to Pittsburgh, Chris?
The moonlight is turning your dress into green fire.
It wasn't to set me free, as it?
And the stars are dancing in your eyes.
Did you come through
500 miles of wilderness to tell me the stars are dancing in my eyes?
Can you think of any better reason?
A woman only thinks what she wants to.
And you want to think l came to set you free?
Maybe no one has the right to own anyone else.
Men and women weren't made to be bought like yards of cloth.
At the tavern, you said you owned me.
I do.
But you want to be free, don't you?
I wonder...
Hey, you're ruining the ordnance.
I'm not sure l want to be free of you, Chris.
Why do you say that?
Because you've taken me out of a horrible nightmare.
Because you've given me kindness and happiness and understanding.
Abby, listen to me.
It wasn't kindness and understanding that made me bring you here.
No? Why did you bring me?
Because l know
Garth will follow.
Garth?
When he sees you here like this, he'll try to take you back, and then l can do what l came to
Pittsburgh to do.
Kill him? Is that it?
Yes, that's it.
And l'm the bait, staked out like a deer to draw a tiger.
That's true, isn't it?
Yes.
And you said the stars were in my eyes.
They were there.
Because l thought...
Oh, it doesn't matter.
Everything that you've done for me is because you wanted to challenge Garth.
You're not a man.
You're a walking loaded rifle with one bloodthirsty purpose, to kill Garth.
You haven't blood in your veins, you've gunpowder.
Abby, maybe you're right.
But this is more important than you or me, or both of us.
If Garth doesn't die within the next few hours, a lot of men and women on this frontier will.
You're either the world's greatest liar or the world's greatest fool.
You're probably both.
I'm going.
You'll stay and see it through.
Why should I?
Because l own you.
A few minutes ago you said nobody should be owned.
Do you ever mean anything you say, Captain Holden?
Here's your good-luck piece.
You'll need it when you meet Mr. Garth.
Miss Hale, l couldn't find you for our dance.
Yes, l know.
No, this one's mine, isn't it, Miss Hale?
No, l'm sorry.
Perhaps the next one,
Miss Hale.
Mistress Hale, you promised this dance to me.
What's happened to Chris?
Gentlemen, l'm not dancing.
Mrs. Fraser, may l have this dance?
I'd love to.
Love? With me?
Mistress Hale.
You promised.
There'll be no living with Baillie after this.
Yeah.
She's madder than a bucketful of hornets, Chris.
You needn't signal,
Mr. Fraser.
He'll know l'm here.
The bear has come for the honey.
He's come for your hide.
Then stand away from me,
Half-Pint.
Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please.
Mistress Hale, will you come forward?
They're going to crown you queen of the ball.
I think not.
May l have your arm, please?
Yes, Captain Ecuyer?
Is this the young lady,
Mr. Garth?
Yes, sir.
My runaway bond slave.
MAN: Bond slave?
I knew l'd seen her before.
WOMAN:
Mistress Hale from England.
Mistress Hale...
Quiet, quiet, please.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
I'll take this girl.
Lieutenant, you may finish this dance with Miss Hale.
Well, sir, that's mighty good of you, but...
This girl is mine.
Captain Ecuyer, Mr. Garth has three indisputable talents.
He is a liar, a cheat and a coward.
Captain Holden.
Captain, l bought this girl, which makes him a liar, he stole her from me, which makes him a cheat, and he won't fight, which makes him a coward.
By your leave, sir.
Captain Steele, will you arrange the time and the place?
Who speaks for you, sir?
John Fraser, and the sooner the better.
The King's birthday ball is no place to arrange a duel.
Mr. Garth and l can step outside and settle this in a few minutes.
Sunup tomorrow.
The light will be better.
In the meantime, l'll take my property.
Not by law.
I am the law here.
The question of who owns this girl will be settled in my office.
Sergeant, music.
Yes, sir.
Ladles and gentlemen, continue dancing, please.
Captain Steele, bring
Miss Hale to my office.
Gentlemen.
WOMAN 1: Well, it might be, so come away.
WOMAN 2:
She scrubs the floors at Bone's tavern.
MAN 1: She can scrub the floor at my house any time she wants.
WOMAN 3: I wonder where she got that dress.
MAN 2: Stolen, l reckon.
Did you know this,
Jane Fraser?
Of course l did.
She's a mighty fine girl.
WOMAN 4: I still say that dress came from Paris.
Don't you go boiling over in there, now.
You ain't supposed to let on to the military why you're here.
Keep your scalp on, John.
Mine's on tighter than yours.
Captain Holden, you haven't one scrap of reason or evidence to support your claim to this girl.
The law requires a bill of sale.
I have it.
Norfolk notary.
Sold to Bone. Bone to me.
ECUYER:
These papers are in order.
You come brawling into Mr. Garth's tavern, killing Indians, stealing bond slaves and now you answer his rightful claim by hurling challenges like a bully in a schoolyard.
Captain Holden's been trying to pick a quarrel with me ever since we left England.
Why?
I ask permission not to answer that.
GARTH: He's a bad loser, that's all.
His vanity was hurt over this girl and he's followed me here to repair it with a bullet.
Is that true?
Did you come here because of this girl?
Yes, sir.
This woman is yours,
Mr. Garth.
You can take her.
Do you realize what you have done to this woman?
Mr. Garth has the legal right to give her the whipping post, the pillory, or the branding iron if he chooses to use it.
Mr. Garth won't live to use It.
Good evening, Captain Ecuyer.
Come, Abby.
You'd better take her out this way.
Captain Holden, you are under my orders.
If you harm... l'll send the dress back to you, Captain Holden.
I'm going after that girl.
No, you are not.
If you try, you'll spend the next five years in the fort's dungeon.
And don't look as though you'd like to cut my heart out.
It's against regulations.
Shall we join the ladies?
Bone leave for Venango?
Yes, two hours ago.
You know what to do.
Abby. You. Get out.
A little sherry, perhaps.
No.
I once penned an ode to the wines of Spain.
"Italian wines are rich..."
Abby. Wait.
"The wines of France are light as air but the wines of Spain..."
Are you going?
"The wines of Spain..."
Why did you go with Holden?
To be free.
He can't set you free.
He may, when he meets you at sunup tomorrow.
Tomorrow never comes.
Aren't you going to fight him?
I don't have to fight for you.
You're mine, just as my horse or my dogs or my boots are mine.
I'll serve my time, 14 years, l'll work faithfully...
Faithfully?
Running away with Holden?
I'm not going to punish you.
But you'll never forget again who you belong to.
Drums of war sound.
All fort die by white flag that is red.
Why do the Indians come to you?
Guyasuta wait for Garth.
You're with them.
Bring the girl.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Take your hands off me.
Stop it. Hannah, please make them stop.
Make them let me go.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Jeremy.
Jeremy.
You savages.
And you fighting a duel in the morning.
Why, this might be your last dance.
Excuse me, ma'am, l'll go and make my will.
Sorry, sir, you're not to pass.
Captain Ecuyer.
Where's the Captain?
What's happened?
Don't let those people in here. This is the King's birthday ball.
I'm sorry, sir, this woman's in distress...
Save your children.
Go. Go get your children.
That's Joe Pruitt's missus from Clapham's.
Clapham's?
That's more than 20 miles.
WOMAN 1: Poor soul.
WOMAN 2: Let me help.
Stand back. Give her room.
Clapham's ain't no more.
They're all dead.
What happened?
Injuns, they killed my Joe.
No.
That child is badly hurt.
Get Dr. Boyd.
Yes, sir.
Some brandy for this woman.
Yes, sir.
They crept up in the night.
How many?
More than 100 of them.
They massacred Colonel Clapham and all his womenfolk and Jim Mealy and the Garvice boys.
The murdering devils. Holden.
WOMAN: My babies.
I've got to get my babies.
Tom, come on.
My kids. I left them with a Seneca squaw.
Well, l was just visiting here.
May be a long visit.
Attention, everyone.
You will bring your families into the fort, your livestock and foodstuffs.
Major Trent, as the settlers come in, form them into militia companies.
Yes, sir.
Captain Steele, put the entire garrison under arms at their posts of alarm.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Hutchins.
Yes, sir.
Run up the signal torch on the gate staff.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Baillie.
Yes, sir.
One squad to stand by the drawbridge.
It remains down till all the settlers are in.
Yes, sir.
Sir, order to load the powder magazine.
Captain Holden.
Yes, sir.
Since you are anxious to leave, take 20 men and level the town.
Dismantle what you can and burn the rest.
Yes, sir.
And leave nothing standing to give cover to the savages.
Take Fraser.
Yes, sir.
Captain Holden.
Be sure you come back.
Yes, sir.
You can't burn my place,
Holden. It took me two years to build that store.
It'll take you all eternity to grow a new scalp.
Where to first, Chris?
Bone's tavern.
Watch your torches.
Move that log out of the way!
Search this place, men.
OFFICER: Stroud, stand watch by the door.
Go to Black Watch's until ordered.
Abby. Abby.
Search back there.
Keep you eyes peeled, now.
Abby.
Everywhere.
Sergeant, pile up everything in this room that will burn.
Yes, sir.
Not in the middle, against the counter...
Captain Holden.
Captain Holden.
JEREMY: Captain Holden.
Hey, Chris, come here.
Yes, sir.
Bring those chairs over here and throw them on.
Yes, sir.
Throw those bundles over.
Where's Abby?
They've taken her,
Hannah and the Indians, to Guyasuta's camp.
MAN: Hurry up, before those redsticks get here.
Guyasuta?
Yes.
Get me some dried meat and a powder horn.
Lend me your rifle and powder horn, John.
Chris, you can't go after her.
You wouldn't stand a chance.
You've seen what they do to white women.
Where are your bullets?
Ecuyer ordered you to burn this town.
They'll burn her.
And you spitted right alongside her.
Chris, you're the goldarndest, contrariest fool l ever did see. I'm going with you.
You're staying here and carrying out
Ecuyer's orders.
Here you are, Captain.
The dried meat and powder horn.
What am l going to tell
Ecuyer about you?
You tell him l'll report to him in heaven, if we both get there.
Good luck, sir.
MAN: All clear upstairs.
All right, put the torch to it.
Let her go.
Let it all come down.
Fire in the stable.
Yes, sir.
Throw a torch under the stairwell.
Here, strike the Ottawas under Pontiac.
Fort Detroit.
Here, the Mingos of Chief Skarat.
Fort Niagara.
Here, the Wyandots of Chief Takee.
Fort Sandusky.
Here, the Senecas under you, Genowah.
Fort Venango.
And here you, Guyasuta, with Delawares, Shawnees and Senecas.
Fort Pitt.
Ecuyer is a shrewd, strong warrior.
Sioto has made medicine.
Fort Pitt will die.
All these forts must die.
By white flag that is red.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
We know, all chief know.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Is the white girl safe?
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Hannah, you will stay here with her.
I go to Fort Pitt.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
My daughter your woman.
She go with you.
As my brother wishes.
But the white girl stays here.
Protect her.
What are they going to do?
Before white one come,
Garth see only this one.
I've tried to tell you that he...
This one love Garth, very big love.
He doesn't mean anything to me.
He mean much to me.
Soon white one, no more.
This one go with husband.
Hannah.
I've heard what they do to white women.
I'm not very brave.
Will you ask them please to let it be quick?
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Never quick.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Chris.
Chris, go back! Go back!
Maybe l've come to the wrong village.
I was looking for great warriors, the Seneca.
Chris, you can't save me.
We are Seneca.
These?
These are not the Senecas l know. I was there when they stopped Braddock.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
These...
These are just squaws painted like men, only fit to torture women.
Chris, they'll kill you.
Keep your tongue between your teeth.
Who calls himself Chief among these woman fighters?
I am Guyasuta.
You think we are women?
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
I am unarmed.
You forget your own laws.
Tell these squaws l come in peace.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
You come in peace, go in peace.
That's better.
Untie her.
Why you come?
I bring belts of peace from Sir William.
Red belt of war has passed.
White man's forts will burn. All die.
White woman burn.
Some may die, but more will come, always more.
White man's medicine is strong, nothing can stop them.
Sioto medicine stop them.
Can Sioto match his medicine against mine?
Sioto can make rains come, winds blow.
Sioto can speak to the dead.
With my medicine l can take this woman, even this worthless squaw and vanish as l came, and Sioto and all your braves can never find us.
You speak big words.
Stand back.
This magic is strong.
It obeys only me.
Watch this little arrow.
It is magic.
Little arrow point to that tree and nowhere else.
Now, you feathered vulture, you make it point somewhere else.
Here, take it.
If it obeys you, the girl dies and l die with her.
But if it does not obey Sioto, l will take the girl and you cannot follow until the arrow turns.
Is it a bargain?
It is bargain.
Make arrow point.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Looks like the little arrow only hears the white man's tongue.
Point at fire.
Little arrow, do not listen to Sioto's medicine.
Point at fire.
Looks like you're not doing so well.
Oh, Chris.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Sioto say not magic.
Arrow point all time at tree.
It points where l tell it to.
It will point at you.
Chris, you can't.
You know it won't.
Squaw talk.
Arm yourself, Guyasuta.
This is the medicine of death.
Give him a knife, the tomahawk.
Not this one, one of the new steel ones of Garth's, a gun.
Now, little arrow, point to the chief of the Seneca.
Take it.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Tell Sioto to make it turn from you if he can.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Turn, arrow.
Point at white man.
The little arrow points only at you, Guyasuta.
Release the squaw.
Take her. Take her.
Guyasuta is once again a great chief.
No. No. Help.
Let her go. Let go.
Get out of here. Go on, go on.
Get away. Get away.
Get away. Go on. Get away.
Get out of here.
Don't fall. Keep your nerve.
I haven't much left.
Don't let them know it, we're not out of here yet.
Guyasuta, if your men follow before that arrow moves it will go right through your heart.
Keep going. Keep going.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Now get.
It's dawn. They'll be hunting us by daylight.
What can we do?
Die more comfortably.
Follow me.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN

(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN

Push those two adrift and get in the other one.
Where to?
Kingdom come.

Look, Chris, they're coming.
Save your breath for paddling.

Chris, the waterfall.
Untie my sash.
Put the sash around my neck and tie it under your arms.
We're going over.
Hang onto me and pray.
Hold tight. Here we go.
Oh, Chris.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Wolves.
There, my little nimrod, is your wolf.
Well, he had wolves for ancestors.
Hello, boy.
Hello, boy, hello, boy.
You all alone?
Where's your family?
They had to get out in a hurry. Look here.
"Injuns Riz.
Me and missus gone to Venango.
"You better get there too if you can read this.
Ben Salter."
We'd better get inside for the night.
What is it?
Clothes.
I wonder if Mrs. Salter would mind.
Well, l'm borrowing
Mr. Salter's shirt whether he minds or not.
Hey.
What's the matter?
Food. Beans.
Just like coming home.
Chris?
Yes.
What happened to the little dog?
Out chasing varmints, l guess.
We'll take him along with us to Ben Salter and his wife at Venango.
I wonder why they didn't take him.
"Benjamin Salter, his Bible."
I was thinking the Salters must have been very happy here.
Why?
It feels like it, doesn't it?
I guess so.
Back in London, l used to want to be a grand lady with carriages and mansions.
Maybe you will someday.
No.
Now l just want what the Salters have. This.
Was she very pretty?
Hmm?
Who?
The girl you bought the green dress for.
Oh, Diana.
I guess so.
Why didn't you marry her?
She liked someone else better.
Better than you?
She must have been crazy.
Good night, Chris.
Good night, Abby.
Hey, aren't you a little bit old to be playing with dolls, young fellow?
Hey, what's the matter?
What's troubling you, huh?
What do you got?
What do you got out there, a bear?
Well, all right, let's go get him.
Come on.
Say, you're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed this morning.
Hey, what's the matter?
What...
Chris? Chris?
Go back in the house, Abby.
Why? What are you doing?
Digging.
Look, good fit. Nice color.
What's this?
A doll.
The Salters won't be coming back, Abby.
They never left.
What do you mean?
Why is the dog...
Don't look.
No one has a chance in this wilderness.
Nobody can fight it.
It'll always be wilderness.
The savages will burn and torture and kill until they get it back.
Abby, get a couple of those sticks and tie them together for a cross.
People like the Salters can never be stopped, Abby.
The Indians can kill them and run them off, but more will keep coming.
The Salters are the New World, unconquered.
Unconquerable because they're strong and free, because they have faith in themselves, and in God.
Here, tie it together with this.
Chris. I need shoeing again.
Venango is just around the bend.
It is? Let's look.
Let's patch the moccasin first.
You mean Venango's goodbye.
Maybe.
You know, they can make a lot of trouble for runaway slaves.
Maybe we'd better call you Mrs. Holden.
Mrs. Holden?
Just for Venango, of course.
Of course. Just for Venango.
But then you may get to like the sound of it.
Might even want it for keeps.
Here.
Are you asking me to marry you?
Yes.
Try it on.
Because you're sorry for me.
I'm only sorry that it took to long to find you.
Hey, what are you crying about?
It's just that l'm so full of happiness it's...
It's overflowing.
What is it?
What are you looking at?
Vultures.
They had surrendered.
It's horrible.
What's that?
Pop, you're alive.
No, l ain't.
For three days, l been a-dying here, and you don't come along until l'm dead.
You've got lots of life, Pop.
Abby, get that canteen of water.
Don't get me no water.
I ain't that dead.
Prop me up.
I'm busted clean through.
How'd the Indians get in?
They walked in.
Chief Genowah, that mangy polecat.
Three times he comes to the fort with his white flag and his promises.
"Surrender," says he,
"and you'll all go free."
When the grub run out, everybody started yelping to run up the white flag.
I warned them, but nobody'd listen.
So they run up that danged white rag.
And all the folks went out, and them redsticks come a-hooting and a-shooting and massacred every last one of them under that white flag.
For three days, l've been trying not to die till some dang fool like you comes along, to warn Fort Pitt.
Fort Pitt.
You got long legs, get them a-going.
You can get down the river at night in a canoe.
Chris?
We're going east.
No, we're not.
That was just a dream we dreamed together for a little while.
We're going east.
There are 600 lives at Fort Pitt.
And Garth is one of them.
You're his, Abby.
If we go back, you go back to him.
We have no choice.
Of course, you ain't.
Get back to Fort Pitt.
Show them this flag.
Tell them what the redsticks is up to.
"Go free," they says.
"Take your people and your cattle.
"All we want is our hunting ground."
That's what he says,
"Take your people and your cattle.
"All we want is our hunting..."
"Go free.
"Take your people and your cattle.
"All we want is our hunting ground."
It's signed with Guyasuta's totem.
We're in a bad way, sir.
We've had no word yet from Colonel Bouquet's relief column.
Are you suggesting we surrender?
Put your weight on that.
I don't think much of our chances.
Then stop thinking.
Heat an iron, Dr. Boyd.
This arrow may have been poisoned.
Tell Guyasuta this is our home and we will defend this ground till the last warrior lies under it.
I'll send my wife with your message,
Captain Ecuyer, but after two months of siege, you've only a few days' provisions.
I just told you...
Get out, get out, both of you.
You'll kill this man.
Captain Steele, you are in command.
Yes, sir.
What's going on here? At ease.
What are you doing with that rope?
We're raising a ghost.
I hope it's a scout from Bouquet.
Oh, Chris, where in blazes did you come from?
I'm sure glad to see you breathing.
Go down and give Abby a boost.
Sure.
We didn't expect you'd come this way again,
Captain Holden.
I have a report for Captain Ecuyer, sir.
Captain Ecuyer is wounded.
I am in command.
There's been treachery at Fort Venango, sir.
Treachery?
That's a strange word from you.
You were under orders to burn the town of Pittsburgh and report back to Captain Ecuyer, were you not?
Yes, sir.
John, let her stand on your shoulders.
You're under arrest for desertion in the face of the enemy.
But, sir...
Mr. Hutchins, disarm him.
That elusive little bond slave will be held as a material witness until the court martial.
I don't believe this cock-and-bull story that Venango surrendered.
Bone here got through.
He says the fort still stands.
Captain Holden is obviously trying to protect himself and this girl.
The Mohawk Trail to Albany and Boston is what they were headed for, and the Indians drove them back.
That's probably Indian blood on this flag.
No, gentlemen, you need more proof than the word of a deserter.
We came back to save your fool necks.
Because there's a Judas here who won't stop until this flag flies over this fort and you're all dead beneath it.
Captain Holden is out of order.
Attacking Mr. Garth will not alter the record.
Return to your seat.
Proceed.
Was the accused headed for he Mohawk Trail and Boston?
What difference does it make?
You're all going to pay a terrible price for not believing us.
Confine yourself to the question.
Was he trying to escape with you to Boston?
I won't answer that.
You must answer.
She needn't.
We were heading for the Mohawk Trail to Albany and Boston.
I submit to the court the prisoner has admitted desertion.
Upon consideration of the matter before it, this court finds the accused guilty of desertion in the face of the enemy.
In accordance with the articles of war, prisoner will be stripped of his military rank and held in confinement until the firing party will execute the sentence of death.
Remove the prisoner.
The runaway bond slave will be returned to her lawful master, Mr. Garth.
Go back to the women's quarters.
You bring white one.
You tried to burn her at the stake.
Your tongue is forked.
I'm through with you.
The firelight's very becoming to that red hair, Abby.
I really should thank Holden for saving you for me, if the firing squad gives me time.
No.
For me, or for you?
For me.
I don't want you to die.
I want you to live.
You can't force me to live any more than you can force me to love.
You belong to me.
You don't want me as a slave.
No, l want you to come to me of your own free will.
I'll come to you of my own free will.
Abby.
Nothing for nothing's given here.
What do you want?
A word from you can open doors.
Sentries can be missing, a guard looking the other way.
You want Chris Holden's life.
Let him go tonight.
Give him his chance to live, and l'll be here.
That stubborn fool would rather die in the morning than leave without you.
He'll go.
It'll be just you and me, alone?
I promise.
(WHISPERS) Chris. Chris.
Abby. How did you... l've been saying goodbye to you over and over again for hours.
Seeing you doesn't make it any easier.
Here.
How did you...
You can get away through the sally port tunnel.
Did someone push the sentry in the river?
Time's running out.
Where's the guard?
You still have friends.
No, this way.
Isn't that door locked?
It will open.
John Fraser?
Find the relief column.
Tell Colonel Bouquet how desperate things are here.
No sentry at the sally port either.
Fraser must have bribed the whole garrison, or did he?
Don't question me, Chris, just go.
Are you going with me?
I'm staying here.
Fraser didn't open these doors, Abby.
Get the relief here, Chris.
Don't let Fort Pitt become another Venango.
You opened them.
You and l died together back there at Venango.
There'll be a mug of rum for every hole in his carcass.
You'll need a keg, Mr. Garth.
These men are possum hunters.
Watch the moat by the sally port tunnel there.
Something moving.
I'll send your keg of rum to the barracks.
Abby?
This one, wife.
You'll go back to your father.
The one you tried to kill will be my wife.
White one love Holden man.
Holden is dead.
Not dead.
He was shot crossing the moat.
No.
This one.
Hannah.
Holden man bring white chief, many, many soldier.
Little fool, why did you do it?
This one wife.
MAN 1: Fire attack on the...
MAN 2: Bucket brigade!
Bucket brigade!
MAN 3: How many men?
MAN 4: Get that roof wet!
Come on. Come on.
Start some this way.
The south barrack's on fire.
Steady there, steady.
WOMAN: Gotta keep moving.
You gotta keep these buckets moving.
Get down.
Here you are.
Hold on to it.
Water wouldn't do you no harm.
Get this fire out.
Hey, Ma, look.
Injuns coming up on that ledge.
You get in the house.
Oh, Ma.
Run along when you're told.
Kill him, Jeremy. Kill him.
Load with chain shot.
Here.
Throw a bunch at them.
Throw it, Jeremy. Throw it!
They can't wait,
Colonel Bouquet.
Fort Pitt can't last three days.
I won't leave my wounded here, and l can't advance a yard till the artillery comes up.
But you can't throw away the 600 lives in Fort Pitt.
Chris.
Captain, l have lost a quarter of my men here at Bushy Run.
Do the Indians know that, sir?
I pray they don't.
If we can make them think...
Think what, Chris?
Send this dispatch back to Legonnier.
Yes, sir.
Colonel, can you give me 100 men?
A hundred?
I can spare 20.
Those men out there.
What?
Give me those men, Colonel, and some wagons.
Are you mad, Chris?
Those men are dead.
And your drums and pipers, and 10 of your Black Watch.
It can't be done, but go ahead and try it.
Whatever is left of us won't be far behind you.
You are hungry.
Steady.
No powder for gun.
Put white flag on pole.
Take your people, go back safe over mountain.
Guyasuta, you can save your breath to run from
Colonel Bouquet's soldiers.
MAN 1: Ain't that an army musket?
MAN 2: Yeah, a Brown Bess.
MAN 3: Ain't one of ours.
The 42nd.
The Kilties.
It's their flag, the Black Watch.
Where'd they get it?
It's the 42nd for sure.
Do you suppose they...
Quiet.
'Tis a Highland bonnet all right.
Where do you suppose they got it?
From the Highlanders.
No mistaking that coat.
I tell you it's a trick.
Bouquet soldier dead.
Chris.
Don't believe the lying varmints.
I come no more.
White flag not on pole when time stick burn there, all die.
Mama.
Hush, dear.
We'll hold our fire exactly six minutes.
That means attack.
Post what additional men you have on the higher bastion.
This birch bark will burn fast.
MAN: Detail dismissed.
Captain Ecuyer should make this decision.
He's a sick man.
You'd better decide for yourself or they'll decide for you.
Where's the relief they promised us?
I say surrender and hoist this flag.
You're yellow, Bone.
We gotta keep on fighting, and anybody that don't think so, pick up that rag.
Why, you.
Mr. Fraser, give me that flag.
Captain Steele.
Hey.
Don't let them hoist this flag.
Hear them war drums?
They'll stop in a minute, then hang onto your hair.
And hang on tight.
Over there,
Grant and his Highlanders were massacred and scalped.
And over there,
Braddock's whole command was massacred.
MAN: But we're stronger.
Now Bouquet is wiped out at Bushy Run.
Will you make
Fort Pitt the next?
MAN: He's right.
The Indians know and all these people know, that your last chance died with the massacred relief column.
MAN: We can't fight with sticks.
What do you say,
Captain Steele?
I ain't aiming to surrender.
We got no chance.
WOMAN: There's the kids to think of.
My wife and me aim to fight it out.
With what, broom sticks?
Quiet. Quiet.
As a soldier, l'd fight.
But as a man responsible for the lives of these women and children, l feel compelled to accept the enemy's terms.
Captain, no. Don't raise it.
I saw the white flag at Venango stained with the blood of people like these who believed the Indians.
I'll vouch for the Indians.
I saw it, Captain.
Raise this flag at the gate staff.
There's plenty of us who'd rather fight, sir.
And l'm one of them.
Proceed, Mr. Hutchins.
MAN: Oh, we'll regret this.
Clark, we'll inform
Captain Ecuyer in his sick room.
Yes, sir.
Give up now, what chance have we got?
We give up, all them massacred folks died for nothing.
If my Joe was alive, he'd say,
"Keep fighting."
You hoist that flag and l'll shoot it down.
With what? An empty rifle?
Get it up, sonny, before we lose our scalps.
I'll have no truck with surrendering.
You ain't got three kids,
Jane Fraser. Get it up.
Garth vouches for the Indians.
Your last chance.
The time's up.
Do you hear?
The drums have stopped.
MAN: That's the signal.
WOMAN:
Get that flag up, quick.
Wait, young man.
Hold that flag.
It may be the wind.
It may be my wishing, but it sounds like the pipes of heaven itself.
I don't hear nothing.
Get it up.
Get it up or we'll all be hearing the pipes of heaven.
No, listen, you big ox.
JEREMY: Listen.
It is. It is.
Chris got through.
There they are.
I can see them.
How many do you see?
It's them.
It's the pipes of the 42nd.
That's Bouquet's column.
Bouquet.
MAN: Tear up that white flag.
GIRL: How many be there, Pa?
I don't know.
Ain't had time to count them yet.
That's the first time l've enjoyed the sound of a bagpipe.
I want to see them.
Come on, take him.
Try not to look as scared as l feel.
They cannot see the hair standing up beneath me bonnet.
(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN
LANGUAGE)
Chris. They're running.
They're running.
Run, you varmints, run.
So Bouquet was wiped out, was he?
Look at them Indians run.
Get to the stable and saddle up three horses.
Three?
I'm taking Abby.
And stock up three saddlebags. Move.
See them, Mr. Garth, ain't it grand?
If l had me a wife, l'd raise hallelujah.
I'll marry you.
Something's wrong with that column.
Looks awfully good to me, sir.
We'll head south into Cherokee country and build back from there.
We can go down the Mon side and hug the bank.
MAN: Hurry up with that bridge, soldier.
WOMAN: Glory be, you're a grand sight.
Chris. Chris, the stables.
Get to the stables.
MAN: Look at them.
Why are they so still,
Jeremy?
The gentlemen are dead.
We'll mount in here.
Hey.
They've stopped yelling.
Give her a hand up.
Chris.
Get over there, Bone.
That's far enough.
Stand clear, Abby.
She's coming with me.
Where you're going, you're going alone.
Let him have it, Bone.
HOLDEN: Bone won't shoot me.
BONE: I won't, huh?
No.
Abby, stand over there.
Because l'm the only one between you and the hangman's rope for double-selling a slave.
Fergus out there doesn't know you acted for Garth.
I do.
But you won't be talking.
Bone, turn your back and get your hands up on that ladder.
All right, Holden.
I'm not fool enough to try to beat you on the draw.
You win.
You can take my gun.
I know you wouldn't shoot a man in the back.
ABBY: Look out, Chris.
You are a better man than you are a soldier,
Holden.
You have earned a firing squad for deserting this fort.
And our gratitude for helping save it.
When Colonel Bouquet arrives, the frontier can start moving west again.
Move with it.
Captain Ecuyer.
What?
Would you... Could you...
Oh, yes, yes, of course.
Who stands for you?
Here, put it on.
Hold hands.
I pronounce you man and wife until you find a minister.
Marriage frees you from slavery, Mrs. Holden.
It won't do the same for you, sir.
You're sweet.
East or west, Abby?
Make it west.
And don't get caught by the Indians again.
Yes, sir.
Or anybody else. Stay free.
Yes, sir.
And close that door.

Navigator to pilot.
Five minutes to target area.
Bombs away, sir.
There's another load, you...
- Bombs all away, sir.
- Good work, men. Let's get out of here.
Matrac, we are approaching the town of Romilly.
Thank you.
- Mama?
- Yes, darling.
- Is it Dad?
- I'm not sure. You be quiet, darling.
- Mother will be right back.
- All right.
Pilot to bombardier.
Open bomb bay doors.
Oh, Jean, darling. Till we meet again.
You were to have gone with the Wing Commander, Mr. Manning, but I happen to be rejoining my outfit not far from your own destination, so they asked me to bring you down from London.
- And what is my...
- Your what, sir?
Oh, nothing, I was about to ask what is my destination.
- A military secret, no doubt.
- Sorry, sir.
I'm lost, and I admit it.
Haven't the slightest idea where we are.
Not a signpost, not a marked road.
We're somewhere near the Channel, unless I miss my guess.
Even for a war correspondent, this is pretty darned mysterious.
Interesting, though.
- Here we are, sir.
- Really?
- Yes, sir.
- We're at an airdrome?
Yes, sir, the base of the famous squad Victoire.
I can't believe it.
Where are the barracks, the wind sleeves, the tarmac runs?
How do they operate here?
Surprising, isn't it?
The French make out quite nicely.
They're an intensely practical people, sir.
- Will you get out, sir?
- Right.
- This is headquarters.
- I'll stow your bag, sir.
- Thank you. Do you mind if I take a look?
- Not at all, sir.
Well, I must say I'm surprised.
This is something new in my experience of military airdromes.
To think that all these incredible bombings come from a quiet place like this.
I suppose those cows are squadron mascots.
Yes, sir.
They've brought us any amount of luck.
They're English, of course, merely on loan to the Frenchmen, as they couldn't very well bring their own cows with them.
Jerseys, sir. The milk is excellent, if you care for milk.
It seems a strange environment for one of the deadliest squadrons in the service.
- The quiet, you mean?
- Yeah.
Oh, the French don't mind it.
As a matter of fact, they rather enjoy it.
It has a way of livening up a bit from time to time.
And now, if I may, sir,
I'll take you to the liaison officer between the Free French squadron and our own Captain Freycinet.
Come in.
- Glad to see you, Hastings.
- I've brought Mr. Manning.
Mr. Manning, Captain Freycinet.
- You're very welcome, Mr. Manning.
- Thank you.
Well, I'll leave you in each other's good hands.
What? You must stay to dinner.
There's a place laid for you.
Sorry, sir. Have to push on. Orders.
Well, goodbye, sir.
I'll have your bag put in your bunk.
- Thank you. Good night.
- Thank you, Hastings.
- Au revoir, Captain.
- Good luck to you.
- Would you like to take your coat off?
- I would, thanks.
Apéritifs will be in.
- Or would you prefer a cocktail?
- Oh, no, that's all right. Thanks.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
Captain Freycinet, the purpose of my visit here...
Oh, I know the purpose of your visit.
Word came this afternoon from the Air Ministry.
You've come to see some French traitors, as Monsieur Laval would call us.
No, Captain,
I've come to see some Free Frenchmen.
To get to know them and to write about them for my news syndicate.
I think we can do with all the understanding we can scrape together in these touchy times.
Well, you can see a few of us here.
As for anything more...
Thank you.
Do you think that Marshal Pétain considers you as traitors, as well as Pierre Laval?
Evidently.
And yet I try to be charitable in my judgments, Mr. Manning.
I try to remember that
Marshal Pétain is an old man now and in the hands of the barbarians.
Á votre santé.
- You've seen him these late years?
- No, but I did once.
Years ago, during the Battle of Verdun.
He visited our squadron, which was then at Senard, at the foot of the Argonne.
You were flying in the last war?
Yes, I was a pilot in the Escadrille Lafayette.
The Escadrille Lafayette?
Why, you must have done your training with us, Mr. Manning.
Why, we're old comrades.
Here, come and have some dinner.
I, too, was a pilote de chasse in Squad 26 of the Cigognes Group.
You know, many times did I see the Indian-head insignia of your squadron on patrol.
Now we meet for the first time.
Had I known you were an old pilote of our service, we would have messed with the squadron.
Oh, that's all right.
Perhaps I can see them later.
Why, of course. They're in that room.
Have you noticed? Not a sound from them.
Remember the old days?
The laughter, the gay talk in every mess?
Phonograph going full tilt.
Now, poor devils.
We're all like that, Free Frenchmen.
We find it hard to be merry.
- I understand they're bombers.
- American Flying Fortresses.
Although, we did begin here three years ago with a few of our own Farmans.
They crossed the Channel as a unit the day the armistice was signed.
And you came with them?
My dear Mr. Manning, you flatter me.
I'm getting along, and I'm blind in one eye.
No, no, I'm nothing but a liaison officer, and I reached England by another route.
They're going out now.
Just to remind the Boche of our existence.
As soon as we finish, I'll take you down to the hangars if you like.
Thanks, I'd like to very much.
Mind the step.
Just over the rise and you can see them.
Great heavens. What is this?
Planes being pulled out of barns?
A haystack for a control tower?
Is this the same place I saw when I came in?
Do you doubt it?
Well, the hedges are gone, the trees are gone and the fields have become runways.
I don't doubt that.
That's simple. It's just magic.
- But there's one thing I can't understand.
- What's that?
- Where are the cows?
- Well, they're taking them in the hangars.
They lead the cows in and lead the planes out. Come on.
They go in as the spearhead of the attack tonight.
They go in to light up the target for the others.
Do they know it? That they'll take the murderous part of the pounding?
They'll give some in their turn.
When I think of what they have to meet in the air and from the ground, Captain, we can be glad we were flying 20-odd years ago.
Yeah.
- Will you excuse me a moment, please?
- Of course.
Again?
Yes, tonight's a special occasion.
Sort of an anniversary.
I understand. You have my permission.
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.
All aircraft, proceed to takeoff positions.
All aircraft, proceed to takeoff positions. Over.
V for Victor. Clear. You may take off.
Vfor Victor. Clear. You may take off.
N for Norman, take off. Good hunting.
Now we can breathe easy for a few hours, have a smoke. As for them...
What's the destination tonight?
Or is that a military secret?
Well, now they're in the air, it's not.
- Berlin again.
- Good. How many?
There'll be 2,000 bombers over the target tonight.
- Two thousand? Great heavens.
- Matrac will like that.
I've been thinking about those men, those grim determined faces.
Especially that gunner, the man you spoke to just before the takeoff.
I can't get him out of my mind.
I feel I've seen him somewhere before.
Matrac. He impressed you?
I've never seen a stronger face or a stranger one.
Not a fellow to take liberties with,
I should say.
No.
I could tell you a story about him.
I've never told anyone.
- Would you care to hear it?
- By all means, Captain.
For the moment, I'll have to ask you to keep it off the record, as you journalists say.
It's for your private ear.
Later, I think it might be told.
This is the story of a little group of whom Matrac was one.
For many years, they suffered every pain, humiliation and indignity that men can have heaped upon them.
I chanced to meet these...
Well, but let that come in its place.
To begin, I'll have to take you far away from here.
The outbreak of the war brought orders for my return to France
from service in New Caledonia.
I was forced to take passage
on the Ville de Nancy,
bound for Marseille with a cargo of nickel ore.
The Ville de Nancy was
one of those venerable tramps,
which wallow across the backwaters of the world year after year.
She wore the customary coat of rust-streaked black paint.
We had a good Breton skipper,
Captain Malo,
who knew his way around the seven seas as a blind man knows his own room.
Also, two decent mates who idolized their captain.
The companionship of such men did much
to keep the tedium of the long, slow voyage from being too oppressive.
And sometimes there were songs of home from the fo'c'sle.
Our crew was made up of hardbitten, salty old-timers,
who may have been no better than they should be,
but were French to a man.
For stokers and coal passers, we had the scum of the Earth,
mongrel dregs from every port in the tropics,
dominated by a chief engineer cut to the same pattern.
As there were but three cabin passengers, we all messed at the Captain's table.
The seat of honor was filled very amply
by a Major Duval
of the Infanterie Coloniale.
He was a dominating, narrow-minded martinet,
who had proved his courage in the last war
and had learned nothing since.
With him was his aide,
Lieutenant Lenoir.
He hung on Duval's every word, a typical yes man.
These, the first and second mates and the chief engineer,
made up our official family.
Oh, yes, there was one other.
A treacherous youth, Jourdain by name, who proved to be the wireless officer.
Latest bulletin, sir.
"A day of comparative quiet was enjoyed on the Maginot Line.
"From the German fortification across the river,
"the Nazi radio broadcast an appeal to the French soldiers
"to lay down their arms and refuse to spill their blood
"in a useless fight for the decadent democracies.
"Some martial music was also broadcast by the Nazis
"and the loyal French soldiers are understood to have booed."
What kind of a war is this?
Soldiers say boo? Soldiers of France?
I am a soldier. I fight you. I say boo?
And listening to music. Is this war?
- I can...
- Or is it a band concert?
- Kindly allow the Commandant to speak.
- I beg your pardon.
I can tell you what kind of a war.
The Germans are afraid.
- They're afraid of our Maginot Line.
- Brilliant, Mon Commandant.
- The whole truth in a nutshell.
- That's right.
They know that no power on Earth can break through it.
What are we going to do, sit there indefinitely?
Yes, we'll sit there indefinitely and even longer if that is necessary.
That is what soldiers are for, to hold the line.
I say the Maginot Line is invincible.
I say the Siegfried Line is invincible.
And what is that but stalemate?
Where does it get us?
Freycinet, I think
I'm going to like you.
Victory comes with endurance.
It came the last time, and it'll come again to the army that outlasts its opponent, the army that holds its lines five minutes longer.
And that army will be the French Army, because its officers will make it hold, because they'll hold their men in place by means of cast-iron discipline.
And what if the Maginot Line is outflanked?
Forgive me, sir, but I've always understood that in a democracy, even a soldier has the right to think.
Discipline is more essential than thought to a combat officer.
An army is not a debating society.
Its thinking is done for them by experts.
I trust the Captain does not believe himself wiser than Marshal Pétain and the general staff.
The British have a general staff, and it seems to feel as I do.
Our allies have no such blind faith in the Maginot Line.
That is because they did not build it.
They're jealous of French genius.
A nation of shopkeepers.
They wanted to sell us the cement.
Very well said, Mon Commandant.
No, do not mention the British.
The word offends me.
The British will fight.
Oh, yes. To the last drop of French blood.
Only last week the Commandant said exactly the same thing.
Only last month the same words were invented in the office of Herr Doktor Goebbels in Berlin.
- Are you accusing me of disloyalty?
- Or is it me you accuse, sir?
Please, let's not accuse anyone, neither our traveling companions, nor our allies.
Very well, I accept your apology.
You ask for my opinions, mark my words, time always proves I'm right.
This was the atmosphere in which I was destined
to make a voyage halfway around the globe.
By the time we'd reached Panama, the world we'd known was falling apart.
The Maginot Line was outflanked.
The invincible French Army was on the run.
Events were happening with alarming swiftness.
"Maginot line flanked."
Fault of our allies, sir.
British, the Belgians.
What did I tell you?
They let our line get flanked.
France can curse the day she let herself get mixed up with foreign alliances.
- Sir?
- No.
Passing through the Panama Canal,
the Ville de Nancy set her helm
for Marseille.
Two days out of Colón, the wireless buzzed continuously.
The air was full of the news of torpedoings and hostile raiders.
Ahoy, the bridge. Submarine!
- Where away?
- Thirty degrees starboard, sir.
Sound the alarm.
- What do you see?
- Some sort of suspicious craft.
Can't be sure.
- Man the guns.
- Aye, sir.
- Hold the fire.
- Aye, sir.
We'll have a torpedo in our belly any minute.
- Hold your fire.
- Hold your fire.
Well, it's no sub.
It's a craft of some sort, isn't it?
- A boat?
- Or a canoe.
See there.
That's a man.
He's alive.
Probably survivors from some torpedoed ship.
Hard starboard.
- Hard starboard.
- Hard starboard.
Slowly.
Stop. Lower a boat.
Let go of the grapple lashings.
Hurry.
Faster, faster.
Hurry.
Easy with them, men.
Pretty far gone.
I needed that.
We've been without food for 20 days.
Without water for five.
Then I won't plague you with questions right now.
Put these men in the aft house.
- Set up the extra cots.
- Aye, sir.
- Open up that door.
- Come on. Easy now.
Tell Cook to bring them some broth.
Then let them sleep.
And you might ask the men if they can spare them some clothes.
Aye, sir.
Captain Malo, what is your opinion of these fellows? Are they French?
One of them is, at least. But what would they be doing in an Indian canoe?
They are not seamen, that's plain.
If we're off the African coast,
I'd wager 10-to-1 that they were deserters from one of our disciplinary battalions.
Don't you say so, Major?
No, I do not.
Since we're not off the African coast, your reasoning lacks something of being brilliant.
Learn to examine the facts, man.
Use your eyes.
Captain Freycinet, perhaps you can do better.
If you want the facts, you'd better let the men explain for themselves.
I will, and hear a pack of lies.
You condemn them without a hearing?
Isn't that unfair?
No, it is not unfair, because I know who they are.
- You mean you've seen them before?
- No, I never saw them before this morning.
But that is immaterial, since I have certain modest deductive powers.
Lenoir was on the right track, though he lacked the logic to carry it through.
These fellows have the convict look about them.
Some of them may have served in the disciplinary battalions, but not recently.
Gentlemen, beyond a shadow of a doubt, they are fugitives from Devil's Island.
From Cayenne? Impossible.
We are at least 1,500 miles from Cayenne.
Do you mean to tell me they have made such a voyage in that small open canoe?
You don't know these fellows, Malo.
The type, I mean.
I was stationed in Cayenne a dozen years ago.
I learned the smell of the convict.
A more depraved and desperate set of scoundrels cannot be found.
No matter what your opinion,
I suggest we hear what they have to say for themselves.
As you wish.
I shall be amused at their lies and by exposing them.
- We'll see, gentlemen.
- Thank you.
- Good evening.
- Good evening, sir.
Come to attention, you men.
You, too.
Haven't you been taught to stand in the presence of officials?
No.
Never mind. This is a free ship and not an armored compound.
I think we can all be seated.
Thank you, sir.
Well, you men seem to be a long way from home.
- You're French? The lot of you?
- Yes, sir.
What's your name?
Renault.
Perhaps these men will now tell us who they are and where they come from.
Willingly, sir.
They are gold miners from Venezuela.
Three of us, though born in France, are naturalized Venezuelans.
The other two were born in Venezuela of French parentage.
I see. Where?
Well, we were working a placer claim
300 miles up a branch of the Orinoco.
Doubtless, you've never been there, sir.
It's deep in the jungle.
You reach it only by canoe.
We heard of the war only two months ago.
- It must be a wilderness, that place.
- Oh, yes, sir. It's terrible.
There's no radio, no settlement, no civilization within 100 miles.
- How did the news reach you?
- Just by chance, Captain.
You see, there are Indian rubber gatherers in that region.
Three of them, just coming in from the coast, stopped at our camp.
Remember?
Well, so we bought a few supplies from them, among other things, an axe wrapped in a Caracas newspaper many months old.
- What paper was that?
- The Caracas Diario.
I even remember the date. November 3.
The first news of the war we heard told us of a raid from the Maginot Line in Alsace.
Very odd.
- And you were interested?
- Naturally, sir.
We are Frenchmen, just like yourselves.
- We wanted to go home and... To fight.
- Likely.
- You. What's your name?
- Matrac.
Obviously, you are the leader.
Suppose you tell us?
- I'll speak for my friend.
- Speak when you're spoken to.
Sit down, sit down.
Well? Go on.
We have no leader. We're all equal.
We're a group of free men.
- You. You who wished to speak just now.
- Thank you, sir.
You were incredulous over our attempt to return to France, and I don't wonder.
Because it was an adventure that only the deepest feelings of patriotism could inspire.
All we had, sir, was our little canoe, together with 200 ounces of gold dust.
Our plan was to sail westward to where we could catch a boat for Panama and from there to France.
But we were upset by a huge swell, and the iron box that contained the gold and our passports were lost.
We righted the boat and went on, nevertheless.
From then on, we were lost.
Helpless. No mast, sail gone, and, Mon Commandant, on my word of honor, all this happened three weeks before you sighted us.
You're one of the naturalized Venezuelans?
- Yes, sir.
- Where was your home there?
- Ciudad Bolívar.
- You at the back there.
So? You didn't catch him.
His accent is perfect.
And you have no papers of any sort?
No proof of identity?
No, sir.
As Marius so truthfully told, they're all at the bottom of the Orinoco.
I see.
All at the bottom of the Orinoco River.
- Yes.
- Very good. Very convenient.
Or is it? We shall see.
Do you have any further questions,
Captain Malo?
No, Commandant. You've asked quite enough questions for all of us.
Yes, I think I've been thorough.
- Have everything you need here?
- Thank you, Captain.
Yes, Captain.
You've been more than good to us.
Fine.
Well, Commandant,
I'm afraid they spoiled your evening.
Their story seemed perfectly plausible and straightforward to me.
Plausible, sir? It was a structure of transparent falsehoods.
I always trust my instinct, sir, never what men tell me, especially convicts.
All convicts are liars.
The Commandant has said it.
I don't believe a word of their story.
Captain Malo, I've come to a decision regarding those rogues.
- You have?
- Yes, in the first place,
- you allow too much freedom.
- What do you propose I should do?
Turn them over to the police, of course, the moment we arrive in Marseille.
If they are honest men, as you so naively suppose,
- they've nothing to fear.
- Anything else?
In the meantime, they're to be locked up in the brig.
Captain Malo, as the ranking representative of the Army of France,
I demand it.
I'm glad you remembered to call me Captain.
No one will be locked up on my ship while I command.
Man's becoming insufferable.
Fortunately, his word will not be the final one when we get to Marseille.
You're absolutely right,
Mon Commandant. The man's insufferable.
- What's our speed?
- Ten-and-a-half knots. 180 revolutions, sir.
- Full speed and 195 revolutions.
- Aye, aye, sir.
I want to reach the danger zone by nightfall.
Full speed. 195 revolutions.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Fine day.
Any day that takes us closer to France is a fine day.
I wonder. On your account, I mean.
I was coming in to tell you, to warn your men of something.
Commandant Duval is of the opinion that you and your friends have escaped from Cayenne.
Some of the others, too.
And I wouldn't be fair if I didn't tell you that I've come to the same conclusion myself.
Will you wait here a moment, please?
Will you come in, please?
Sit down.
Thank you.
Captain, Renault's told us what you said, and we've been talking here together.
There's nothing to do. It's true.
We're convicts escaped from Cayenne.
We're Frenchmen.
Convicts or not, we can kill Germans.
- What is more important than that?
- Shut up. What do you know about it?
We're as good Frenchmen as a lot who have never been sent to Cayenne.
We are not soft, us convicts.
We can kill Germans.
Keep out of this, Petit.
- Why have you told us this, Captain?
- To put you on your guard.
You're for us, then?
Yes. France needs men.
You see? I told you he would be for us.
- Even if we are convicts?
- What does that matter?
I guess it's time you heard our story.
Tell him, Renault.
Yes, but what shall I begin with?
With whom shall I begin?
Now there is Petit.
He is from Provence.
What caused him to become a convict?
- It was the love of a farmer for his land.
- You are right.
I farmed the land my father farmed and his father before him.
My wife and I planted as the seasons went by.
And then the government came, and they built a dam.
They flooded all my land.
I guess I went kind of crazy.
He ran to the control station and attempted to smash the machinery.
When the employees tried to seize him, he maimed several and killed one.
The government let me off easy.
Instead of being guillotined,
I was transported for life to Guiana.
Do you know French Guiana?
It is the most corrupt and neglected of all our colonies.
There in the steaming equatorial climate, there're 5,000 or 6,000 men just like us,
struggling against the heavy undergrowth in the very depths of the jungle.
Slaves half-naked in the forests,
tortured by heat and humidity, mosquitoes, fever, rotten food.
Men die or else go insane.
Here you might have found Petit laboring to build a road.
I will tell you about this road.
The convicts call it Route Zero, because it will never exist.
Already it has been under construction for more than half a century,
and for that, there is exactly 16 miles to show.
And for those 16 miles, there is one dead convict for every yard.
Not far from where Petit worked, you might have run across Garou
working in a mahogany camp at Charven.
Formerly a mechanic and a professional racer of motorcars,
he had killed his sweetheart during a lover's quarrel.
In certain circles, it was considered crude of him to accomplish this end with an axe.
Well, of course, since then Garou has reformed.
He's learned discipline. Haven't you?
Cayenne is a very good school for that.
And now, as a pleasant diversion, may I please introduce myself?
As you may already have discovered,
Mon Capitaine, I'm a very clever man.
And sensitive.
Sensitive down to my fingertips.
In fact, these fingers made me the best safecracker in Paris and a virtuoso among the pickpockets.
Oh, they had such a delicate touch, and from the purses of the rich they brought forth brilliant symphonies as from a piano.
Your story is a delightful diversion, my friend.
But one doesn't tell a glib story with a dry tongue.
You will find a bottle of cognac in my cabin.
- Thank you. What else might I find?
- I'll take a chance.
Now tell me about yourself.
I'm a deserter of the Army of France.
In the last war, at the age of 16, I enlisted.
Three months later, I ran away.
I discovered a terrible thing about myself.
I was a coward.
Later I went to Morocco to enlist in the Foreign Legion in an effort to redeem myself, but I got arrested.
You see, even a deserter and convict can love his country, Captain.
Can you imagine, then, my feelings,
when during the long years of my imprisonment,
I had to watch every morning the tricolor being raised?
Soon I discovered that there was another who every morning looked at the flag,
the sight of which seemed to him like a benediction, like a sacrament.
I came to feel a strange kinship with this man,
because every morning we did the same thing at the same time.
The convicts, we called him Grandpère.
He was a libérés, a free man.
That is, he had served his sentence, but was not permitted to leave the colony.
Since Cayenne offers no employment for free men,
the lot of these libérés was hopeless.
But Grandpère was more resourceful than most.
He became a catcher of butterflies, for which the Guianas are famous.
The goods he made from these, he sold to the tourists,
and the butterflies themselves to collectors.
Thus, franc by franc and sou by sou,
Grandpère was able to put together a little sum.
For Grandpère had a plan and a hope.
The same plan and hope of all of us.
Escape.
Hold it, you. This is a closed road.
We're not guarding butterflies.
I heard there was a special big kind up here.
- I forgot it was a toll road.
- These are cheap cigarettes.
They won't be when you sell them to the convicts.
Hi, Grandpère.
- How is it with you and your butterflies?
- How is with you and your mosquitoes?
I wish they were pigs of Germans.
- What did you say?
- Just what I said.
The old man asked you a simple question,
Petit.
I said I wish I was in France killing pigs of Germans instead of mosquitoes.
You mean that you'd fight for our country if you were free?
Sooner than most, I swear it.
Not sooner than me.
There is only one thing I hate more than a guard, and that's a Nazi.
How about you?
What are you, a recruiting officer?
Or is this a cross-examination?
I'm just asking him. Well?
I'm a patriot, to answer your question.
And my friend over there, Marius, he's a patriot, too.
You see over there by the guard?
He is very clever. Everything there is to know about bribery, Marius knows.
He would be a very useful man if one were planning an escape.
Maybe.
- There is no escape. Don't talk about it.
- We are silly to even listen.
Old man just play games with our mind, that's all.
But I have heard he has money, lots of it.
Well, that's different.
That's something else again, eh, Marius?
Yeah, that would be different.
You there.
This fellow got lost in the swamp.
I told him he could spend the night with you.
What's this, a hotel?
We're crowded already.
Thank you. Thank you, my friends.
What are you doing here?
I paid the Sergeant for your company.
And I brought you a present.
- What is all this talk about being lost?
- There had to be an excuse.
You said you would fight for France.
So she must mean something to you, in spite of you being here.
I thought it would be nice to drink together and talk about home.
- Oh, that's a crazy idea.
- I think about my home all the time.
- My farm and my old woman.
- Yes, a farm is good.
There is nothing better than the good French soil.
No, I'll take Paris any day.
Montmartre and Moulin Rouge,
Bal Tabarin and the women. The women.
Paris isn't France.
I like the open country.
Long white roads and green trees.
The most beautiful place in the world.
Lorraine.
For me, France will always be the great tradition.
Versailles, Joan of Arc, statues and monuments.
Napoleon sleeping in greatness in the Invalides.
Place Vendôme.
Tradition that was too big for a boy of 16, who was ashamed to find himself a coward.
If it were to cost my life, I...
It would be a small price to pay to redeem myself.
I would fight and die gladly to make France free.
Who wouldn't?
I am past 65.
But if we can make sure that here are four Frenchmen at least who feel as I do about our country, who, if they had the chance, would fight for France.
If I can convince myself to believe you,
I might...
- You might what?
- I might, even though I'm an old man, still find a way to serve my country.
- But, tell me again, if you were in France...
- We would fight.
But what kind of talk is this?
We're not in France.
We're in this stinking hole.
What do we do? Grow wings to fly with?
- Or do we walk across the Atlantic?
- A canoe might be bought.
A canoe might float down the river to the sea.
A ship might be boarded.
- Listen, old man, if you're joking with us...
- I'm not joking.
I want to be sure that you are the men.
How many I've talked to before.
Can I take a chance on you?
Are you lying to me?
Have you the courage to beat the river and the sea?
Well, if we haven't, I know one who has.
And if he would be with us...
You know him.
- His name is Matrac.
- Can he get us through the swamp?
- That is the main thing.
- I know the swamp like my own hand.
- But the river and the sea?
- Matrac knows the ocean.
He escaped once in a canoe to Venezuela, but they sent him back.
- Is this man a patriot?
- Yes, he is a patriot.
A greater patriot than any of us can ever hope to be.
I swear it, he fought the Nazis long before there was a war.
It was in 1938, during the Munich Crisis.
Daladier has just returned by plane from Munich where he, a Frenchman, betrayed France to the enemy.
That's fantastic enough in all conscience, but an even more fantastic thing has just happened right here at the airport. You getting that?
Go ahead.
Instead of being torn to pieces by an outraged mob,
the mob welcomed him home a hero.
It's unbelievable.
From where I'm phoning, I can see the litter of flowers on the runway where the crowd pelted him not with stones, mind you, but with flowers.
It's incredible, unbelievable.
Raoul? Can you print that?
Jean, please get out.
Jean! Jean!
Jean, it's no use!
Everything I've worked for smashed to bits.
Did you see the them, the police?
The dirty Fascist flunkies.
Jean, it may be hard right now, but you must remember that they are still Frenchmen who believe in the things we believe in.
They stood there, just stood there watching, just to make sure a good job was done.
Darling, you've been driving yourself too hard. You need some rest.
I know the place, Jean. Romilly. You said you wanted to go back there someday.
- Romilly?
- Yes. Remember?
Remember where it was we first met?
Right over there, beyond that bend.
This is the very spot.
You were wearing one of those big floppy yellow hats and a basket on your arm.
Is that all? Must have been a warm day.
How long has it been, Jean?
Oh, when I think of what's happened, it seems like a century.
Well, don't think about it.
You know, you're a lot prettier now than you were then.
Really?
Wonder why we never thought of getting married.
Oh, I've thought of it, Jean, very often.
But I had a rival.
France.
That's ancient history.
Think it's too late?
How's the knee these days, Jacques?
Ça Va, Monsieur Le Maire, if you do not complain about it.
Now his two sons, both soldiers.
- Monsieur thinks there'll be another war?
- Will be?
We've already lost the first three battles, the Rhineland, Vienna and Munich.
- But in a military way?
- Jean, no politics.
Madame is right.
No politics tonight, of all nights.
I guess I can still bend my knees.
They won't crack.
Happy?
- To us.
- Together always.
It's funny how much more you can say with a few bars of music than a basketful of words.
Jean?
- Let's go.
- Why? What's the matter?
- Nothing.
- You look as if you'd seen a ghost.
- Oh, I'm just a little tired from shopping.
- All right.
You know, you're a funny girl.
We just about get unpacked and settle down, and you wanna pack up and run away again.
I'm going to get my wedding trip in while I can.
Jean?
Remember the boat trip we said we'd take someday?
You wanted to do a series of stories on South America.
Yes. Guatemala, Peru.
- Seems like a long time ago.
- You know, we could still do it.
We could get visas in Marseille for Portugal and sail from...
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
Crazy kids.
- Oh, I can't...
- Look now. You can look now. Come on.
They missed us by that much.
- I can't go on any longer.
- Oh, come on, Paula.
I tell you it's all over.
Nobody got hurt.
It's not that, Jean.
What are you talking about?
Darling, you've got to get away.
They're looking for you.
Who's looking for me?
What are you talking about?
The police.
You're wanted, Jean, for murder.
Yes.
There.
I'm not gonna run away.
There still must be some justice left in France.
But, Jean, don't you see that the same people who can pay for riots and killing can hire courts, judges and juries?
They can't get away with it, the dirty, murdering...
Please, darling, if you love me.
There's still room for the truth.
But you can't print the truth on a smashed press.
No, but I can still talk.
I'm going back and stand trial.
I've got to.
But you won't prove anything.
You'll get yourself killed.
I want you to fight, Jean, not be a martyr.
It's not just us, our lives, it's the life of our country.
If we get away, go to America or somewhere, we can do something about it.
We can shout the truth and tell people what's going on.
Jean, please.
All right, we'll go.
Jean?
Jean? Are you awake?
- Jean!
- Here I am. Out here.
Oh, darling. I was so frightened.
I couldn't sleep.
I tried not to wake you.
- Monsieur Matrac?
- Yes.
You're under arrest.
"For the crime of inciting a riot and for complicity in the events
"which led to the death of one Raoul Dulaine
"and for other traitorous acts against the Republic of France,
"I sentence you to 15 years
- "in the penal colony of Guiana."
- Oh, Jean!
I'll be waiting. I'll be waiting.
Can you doubt that this man is a patriot?
No. He is a great patriot.
He's the man to lead us.
But where is he? Where can we find him?
He's in solitary.
He will be there for another two months.
What was his offence?
Well, there was a letter from someone very dear to him at home.
One of the guards made a dirty joke and dropped the letter in the mud, so Matrac knifed him.
Two months?
Men have gone mad in the château in two days.
Not Matrac.
Marius could get word to him of our plans.
Sure, and he would be worth waiting for, even it were two years.
Here on St. Joseph's Isle, there's a building like nothing else in the world.
One can go mad in these pits.
Nothing to see except blank walls.
Nothing to think about except escape.
No sound except the beat of one's own pulse.
Slowly one's mind, like one's body and soul, gives way.
Then, when this happens, one is put on the mad side of the barracks.
Until this happens, one may remain in the cells of the other half,
where men are not mad, but only going mad.
Here for long months had been Matrac, the man I had sworn was a patriot.
Because of his intense and fiery nature,
imprisonment was especially bitter to Matrac.
But somehow, slowly and bitterly,
the days of his solitary confinement went by.
French justice.
Beautiful, decadent France.
A country that gives birth to a bunch of rotten Fascist panderers.
I hate France.
He's talking to himself all the time now.
He'll soon be crazy like the rest of them.
Not me, my friend.
You will pay special attention to Monsieur Matrac.
He's a famous person, friend of politicians.
He has influence, as you see.
You're as rotten as the France that pays you.
If any letters come for Monsieur Matrac, you will see that they are delivered at once.
Monsieur Matrac does not like to be kept waiting.
Now you'll get it.
Incorrigible.
Matrac? Marius.
- Hey! What are you doing there?
- Nothing.
This, then, was the man we had selected to lead us.
By the time he returned from the rock, everything was in readiness.
Clever Marius had even gotten himself assigned keeper of our barracks.
Grandpère was waiting for us with a canoe in the swamps of the Maroni.
This was the night.
Everything was in readiness.
With any luck at all...
Tonight before 10:00.
I'm going, too.
- Where?
- With you.
- There's no room.
- Unless I go, I squeal.
All right, Bijou, you go.
We waited in the semi-darkness.
9:00.
9:30.
Five minutes to 10:00.
One minute to 10:00.
Bijou.
- Where is Bijou? I don't see him.
- He changed his mind.
- Hi, Grandpère.
- Grandpère.
You made it.
No, we didn't.
We are still back in the barracks.
Save your jokes.
- So you're Grandpère?
- And you're Matrac.
I'm glad you're going to lead us back to fight for our country.
Well, we better shove off.
Hey, be careful with that paddle.
Each time you splash, we ship water.
I can't help it. The boat is overloaded.
If we have to bail now, what's going to happen when we hit the rough water of the ocean?
We'll be swamped.
Stop yapping.
We'll have to take that chance.
It's getting light.
We'll get off the river and hide out on that sand spit.
Put out to sea tonight.
Four.
Five.
- We are one too many.
- Yes.
If Bijou had come onboard, we would all be at the bottom of the river by now.
I know what the rest of you are thinking.
- I am the heaviest.
- That's right.
Well, it's hard luck, Petit, but you are elected, isn't he, Matrac?
What, leave Petit when we're going home to kill Germans?
What do you say to that, Grandpère?
Whoever stays, it can't be him.
- But he weighs more than any of us.
- So he does.
Well, speak up, Grandpère.
It's your canoe.
That's right. If it wasn't for Grandpère, none of us would be going.
And who did he speak to first?
Not to you. You weren't even there.
What's that got to do with it?
I'm smaller than any of you.
Even Garou weighs a good 10 pounds more than I do.
You weigh enough to lighten the canoe all that's needed.
- Yeah? And who got the word to Matrac?
- Shut up, the bunch of you.
You...
Well, Grandpère?
Lads, Petit is going and the rest of you with him.
It's me that stays.
- No. You? Never.
- Let him finish.
- What's the idea?
- Well, you see, lads, it's this way.
For 35 years, I thought that the one hope of my life was to escape.
Yeah, that's what I've thought.
And when this came, it looked like my last chance.
I'd never have another.
But, when it gets right down to it,
I suddenly find that I'm afraid of the sea.
Yeah, and I'm scared.
That's the plain truth.
I thought I'd have enough courage to make this voyage, but I see now I haven't.
You lie, Grandpère.
You, a coward?
I would swap my guts for yours any day.
All right, all right, maybe I could stand the voyage if it came right down to it.
But the fact is, I've changed my mind.
I don't want to go.
This place is kind of a home to me now.
I'd miss it.
You lie, Grandpère.
Listen to me. You, too, Matrac.
It's my canoe.
Who goes in my canoe is up to me to say.
And I say it's you that goes and me that stays.
I'm past 65.
I'm too old to fight.
That was the idea of getting away, wasn't it?
Or was it?
I've got your promise on that.
I think I'd like to have it again, kind of formal.
Not just nods, but words, like you would speak in church, maybe.
- You want us to say our beads?
- Shut up, Marius.
What words?
I don't exactly know when it comes down to it.
I'll have to make them up as I go along.
First, get up, all of you.
Raise your right hand.
That's to begin with.
This is between you and me.
Now first you say "I," and then your name.
I...
Promise that I will do everything in my power...
"Promise that I will do everything in my power."
...to reach France, our country...
"To reach France, our country."
...our mother country we love in fair weather or foul.
"Our mother country we love in fair weather or foul."
I promise to fight for her...
"I promise to fight for her."
...to the last drop of my blood.
"To the last drop of my blood."
I guess that's all, except to get in the boat and not waste any more of this good wind.
Good luck.
Good luck.
Good luck.
So you see we have gone through quite something to get this far, Captain, and nobody is going to make us turn back now, if only for the little old man who didn't get to come with us.
Yes, Grandpère is the real hero of our story.
I agree with you.
That was a good oath you swore with the old man.
- I wouldn't want to be the one to break it.
- It will not be broken.
We trust each other.
Well, we've talked all night.
- You men should get some sleep.
- Now, wait.
- Are you going to help us?
- Yes. I'll speak to Captain Malo.
He agrees with me that no soldier is unwelcome to France.
All hands on deck. All hands on deck.
All hands on deck. All hands on deck.
Men,
I have just received a wireless message which is of concern to all of us.
"June 23.
"France, under the leadership of Marshal Pétain,
"has signed an armistice with Germany.
"According to reports, an emergency government has been set up in Vichy,
"and is negotiating with the Germans.
"It is agreed that the Nazis will occupy the capital
"and that Hitler will make a triumphant entry into Paris."
I will not try to express the common feelings of all of us on this blackest day in the history of our motherland.
As further details are received, they will be posted on the bulletin board.
You will now carry on with your duties.
- Take the altitude.
- Yes, sir.
Well?
I'm worried, Captain Freycinet.
I want your advice.
About what?
If I follow my orders and go to Marseille, you'll see what will happen.
My ship and her cargo will fall into hands that are friendly to Berlin.
You can imagine how delighted the Germans would be
- with a gift of 6,000 tons of nickel ore.
- Yeah.
Well, they're not going to get it or the Ville de Nancy, either.
When the watch changes,
I'm altering our course for England.
Fine.
What about Duval?
He is to know nothing about it.
The new course will be kept a secret.
My mates will know, naturally.
They'll be as pleased as yourself.
I can count on every one of the seamen, but the engine room, they're not to be trusted, least of all, the Chief.
You know how he hates the English.
What's your opinion of the convicts?
In the event of trouble, will they be with us?
- To a man, I think.
- To a man, except Matrac.
And where he leads, they follow.
Did you see him when we got the news?
I'm not too sure of him.
I'd stake my life on him.
I don't know why, but I feel I know my man.
At heart, he's a Frenchman, more than any of them.
More than any of us, perhaps.
- I'll have to take your word for it.
- I think you can.
Captain Freycinet?
- May I ask you something, sir?
- What is it?
Can you persuade Captain Malo to reach Marseille at night?
Marseille? Why do you ask?
So I can swim ashore.
I don't trust this Major Duval.
- Yes? Why not?
- He'll radio the police.
I've been fighting his kind all my life.
I know what to expect.
There are many ways to serve your country, Matrac.
What if you didn't reach Marseille?
I've got to reach Marseille.
I don't care about my country.
The France you and I loved is dead,
Captain.
She's been dying for a long time.
I saw her die in the Rhineland and in Munich.
Now that her death is complete,
I can stop lying and tell the truth.
I'm trying to get back to a woman.
I never intended to fight.
I know about Paula and all that you've suffered.
But the France that you and I love, Matrac, is at war.
If you won't fight, why should we help you escape?
I'll leave that to your conscience.
Your wife is waiting for the man who went away, the man who loved his country, the patriot.
Would you betray such a woman?
I leave that to your conscience.
Imperceptibly, we swung northward,
marking a course that would take
the Ville de Nancy to England.
But could the secret be kept?
On the morning of June the 26th,
I was awakened by the profound silence which had settled over the ship.
I attributed this to the old cause, engine trouble, and thought no more about it,
except to wonder how long we'd be adrift this time.
Fortunately, the sea was calm.
I rang for the mess boy.
As yet, I had no suspicion that anything was wrong.
Then I noticed that my pistol was missing from its holster.
What the devil do you mean?
Open this door.
What's the meaning of this?
Who locked my door?
- I did, sir.
- For what reason?
Commandant Duval's orders.
You're to come with me.
- Where's Captain Malo?
- You'll see him, sir.
Go on.
Come on!
What the devil is the meaning of this?
Captain Malo, I understand our course has been changed.
- Have you received new orders?
- That's my business, sir.
I've studied your chart.
We're no longer heading for Marseille.
- Correct, sir.
- For what reason?
On our present course, we run the greatest risk of being picked up by a British destroyer.
Would you consider that such a calamity?
I would consider it a great misfortune, certainly.
France has no ships to spare for England.
You'd prefer the Germans to have her, perhaps?
I prefer to be a realist. We've argued these matters before, Captain Malo.
Now we'll settle them with the only argument that means anything. Force!
Take him down with the rest.
Men, a new order has been born in Europe.
France has been given the privilege of becoming a part of it.
The watchword of this new order is discipline.
From now on, you will navigate this ship under my command until we reach Marseille.
- This is piracy, Duval.
- And your action is treason.
I'm willing to let both questions be decided by the authorities at home.
But I'm a reasonable man.
If I give you your liberty, will you give me your word of honor
- to take this ship back to Marseille?
- Certainly not.
You may control the ship, but you'll never bring her into port.
No decent seaman would serve you.
The men will do well to consider.
Those who cooperate will be given rewards and security in the new France.
I speak especially to you convicts.
To every man who helps bring this ship to Marseille,
I promise a full pardon and favor of the Vichy government.
Don't move! Hold it, men! Hold it!
Take your stations and prepare to get underway.
Confine the engine-room crew below decks,
- and see that they do their work.
- Aye, aye, sir.
And no more nonsense.
Lead them below! Lively, men!
- Get going!
- Move on.
Get below.
Get down.
- Good work, men.
- It was a pleasure, Mon Commandant.
- Are there any killed?
- No, sir.
Good.
Obviously, some skulls are too thick to damage.
Have Duval and his yes man locked in a cabin for the rest of the voyage.
Aye, aye, sir.
You two, up on the B Deck.
Thank you, Matrac.
Clear the deck. Hook up the boom, guys.
Lend a hand, men.
All right, grab ahold.
You'll regret this, Malo. The day will come when you'll bitterly regret it.
Quiet, men. Quiet.
The dirty rat is giving our position.
Commandant, let me have him.
Carry out the orders.
- Turn to.
- Turn to.
- Motors.
- A plane.
I can't see it.
- Man the guns.
- Man the guns there.
Man the aft guns.
You men, take cover.
Hurry up, you men, take cover!
Look, they're still alive.
Matrac, what are you doing?
Stop it! Stop it, Matrac!
What are you doing?
You cannot assassinate helpless men!
Look around you, Captain, and see who are the assassins.
We finished them.
We've shown the dirty Germans.
It was great, what you did.
We all did it.
I just happened to get to the gun.
We'll destroy them all, won't we?
Just like we got this plane.
Drive them out of France.
Of course we will.
Well, we got the ore to England, and very glad they were to get it.
- Got the men there, too.
- They weren't interned?
Oh, no. We all stuck with the story they were survivors from a torpedoed ship.
I remember this Matrac now.
His paper was small, but every journalist in Europe admired the fight he put up against appeasement in the Munich sellout.
He still fights.
The bombs they're dropping tonight are editorials the Germans will understand.
There are so many questions on the tip of my tongue.
Has Paula rejoined her husband?
Did he ever see his son?
- Never, but he visits them often.
- But how, if he's never seen them?
Well, he visits them in a strange way.
Often when he's on a bombing mission, he drops them a letter in a weighted steel tube.
When you saw him tonight, he was asking permission to turn 92 degrees south to Romilly to drop such a letter.
So, you see, they're not actually separated.
I beg your pardon, Captain.
The reports are beginning to come in now.
- Flights returning.
- Thank you, Sergeant.
Would you care to walk down to the hangar?
Why, yes, of course.
Tell me, Captain, what happened to the other men?
I know Matrac's here, but where are the others? Where's Captain Malo?
He's in command of a minesweeper manned by French seamen.
They work in the Channel. Often,
I suppose, in sight of their homeland.
- And Garou?
- Oh, you'll see him.
Step down, Garou.
Manning, this is Corporal Garou.
How are you, Corporal?
He's the best mechanic in Great Britain,
French or English.
Give him some scrap iron, a bit of wires, some old aluminum pots and pans, and he'll make you a plane in three hours.
You exaggerate, Mon Capitaine.
It would take me four hours at least.
And what of Petit?
He's a tireless member of our ground crew, often working 18 hours a day.
There he is now, over there by the crane.
Well, Manning,
I think that accounts for the lot.
All but one. What happened to Renault?
Not a sign of the old fear.
He's the pilot of the plane in which Matrac is flying tonight.
They're coming, Mon Capitaine.
C for Charles, landed 04:17.
C for Charles, landed 04:17.
F for Freddie, landed 04:23.
F for Freddie, landed 04:23. Over.
N for Norman, landed 04:36.
N for Norman, landed 04:36.
Who got the big oil tank?
Was it you, Rocroi?
Of course, who else?
Many thanks for the lights.
We made good use of it.
- Heil Hitler.
- We gave him heil tonight.
Mr. Manning, this is Squadron Leader Dompierre.
Hi there, Mr. Manning.
- How about a smoke?
- Yes, please.
- Where is Renault?
- Oh, he'll be along.
Why don't you turn in, Dompierre?
I'll let you know as soon as they've landed.
No, I'm fussy as an old hen with one chick missing.
V for Victor, come in.
V for Victor, come in. Over to you.
- There is no reply, sir.
- Keep trying.
V for Victor, come in.
Vfor Victor, come in. Over to you.
V for Victor, come in.
All planes accounted for except Renault's.
You gave him permission to leave the formation.
- His plane took a lot of punishment.
- Yeah.
I'm afraid, Matrac, we can't make Romilly.
We have to turn back to the base.
Sorry, Matrac.
Now you make your wish and blow out your candles.
All right.
Is it bad to make a bad wish?
Yes, Jean.
Even if it is about Hitler?
Well, it's better if you make a good wish.
All right, then.
I'll make a wish about Daddy. I wish...
Oh, you mustn't tell me your wish, or it won't come true.
I'll know what it is, anyway.
Now come on closer, and blow them as hard as you can.
All right.
- There.
- I did it!
Now I'll really grow up to be like Daddy.
I'm not supposed to say.
Oh, well, that's all right, darling.
You've got your wish already, anyway.
You're like him in many ways.
You have his eyes.
You have his nice hands.
I hope you have his heart.
Was it the best heart in the world?
I'll bet it was.
Oh, it is a very good heart, Jean.
A tender heart to be in such a rugged body.
You know, you can thank God if you grow up to be like him.
Can I eat my cake now?
Put your napkin on like a good boy. There.
- Daddy?
- Maybe. Let's look.
Come on, darling.
- Is it Daddy? Are you sure it's him?
- It may be.
- I think it is.
- But he wouldn't miss today, would he?
- Does he know it's my birthday?
- Yes, dear, he knows.
But they've gone past, Mama.
- I don't see anything. Do you?
- No, dear.
He didn't fly over.
Perhaps it wasn't him.
Ears like a dog.
Vfor Victor to Fox. We're coming in.
Two motors gone.
Limited control. Casualty.
Victor in trouble.
Stand by, ambulance and crash truck.
- Stretcher-bearers.
- Who?
Beaumont is hit.
Hurry, he's bleeding all over the place.
- Anyone else?
- Yeah, Matrac.
He got two Messerschmitts.
He didn't get the third one.
It was for his kid's birthday.
We couldn't make it.
My comrades,
I can think of no more fitting last words for our friend than those which he himself wrote as his last words and wasn't able to deliver.
"My dear son,
"today you are 5 years old, and your father has never seen you.
"But someday, in a better world, he will.
I write to you of that day.
"Together we walk, hand in hand.
We walk and we look.
"And some of the things we see are wonderful,
"and some are terrible.
"On a green stretch of ground are 10,000 graves,
"and you feel hatred welling up in your heart.
"This was, but it will never be again.
"The world has been cured since your father treated
"that terrible abscess on its body with iron and fire.
"And there were millions of healers who worked with him
"and made sure there would be no recurrence.
"Their deadly conflict was waged to decide your future.
"Your friends did not spare themselves and were ruthless to your foes.
"You are the heir
"of what your father and your friends won for you with their blood.
"From their hands, you have received the flag of happiness and freedom.
"My son, be the standard-bearer of the great age they have made possible.
"It would be too tragic if the men of goodwill
"should ever be lax or fail again to build a world
"where youth may love without fear,
"and where parents may grow old with their children,
"and where men will be worthy of each other's faith.
"Take care of your mother, Jean.
"I hold you in my arms. I kiss you both.
"May God keep you and love you as I do.
"Good night and Au revoir till our work is finished.
"And until I see you, remember this.
"France lives. Vive la France."
That letter will be delivered.
English
'September 9th, 1904,
'on board the Discovery, homeward bound from the Antarctic.
'I've added a little, I hope, to the knowledge gleaned
'by Captain Cook, Sir James Ross and other explorers before me.
'But I have only touched the fringe of things.
'I leave behind a whole continent,
'vast, mysterious, inhospitable,
'and still, to all intents and purposes, unknown.'
- Well, good night, Scott.
- Good night, sir.
I'm sorry, but that's how the land lies.
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good luck to you.
- Sit up a little, Con.
- Hm?
- Sit up.
- Hm, sorry.
Something's gone wrong, hasn't it?
You can't go ahead.
Oh, we can go ahead, all right.
The Treasury won't let us have the money, that's all.
- Is that very bad?
- Yes.
It means I get the men but not the backing.
- I should have to make a public appeal.
- Well, why don't you?
You see, if I do go ahead with this show,
I might lose my chance in the Navy.
That would mean looking for some other job, and that would mean discomfort and unpleasantness for you.
As far as I'm concerned,
I'd take it on any day.
As far as we're concerned, Con, any day.
You knew the Antarctic long before you knew me.
I always knew you'd go back.
And I'm not the least jealous.
As a matter of fact, I don't think
I'd love you so much if you didn't.
Don't move, Con.
Do you remember walking along the sands just after the tide had gone out?
I asked you what exploration really meant to you.
The sands were still wet, and you said, "The fascination of making the first footmarks."
I'm a very, very lucky man.
Now, what shall it be?
"I appeal with confidence" or "I confidently appeal"?
"It is with confidence that we appeal..."
Lunch!
Lunch is ready, dear.
Just in time, Oriana.
- What is it?
- A flea, a rare one.
Just hold him while I get some spirit to preserve him.
No ordinary flea, Oriana.
I'll send him to Rothschild for his collection.
You might as well send him my soufflé too.
- Is that done now?
- Yes, quite done.
Never mind.
Oh, how's the drawing going?
Natterer's Bat. Lovely name.
Oh, isn't it heavenly here?
All on our own.
- Except for dead bats.
- And very dead grouse.
I wish they wouldn't keep sending them to you on your holiday.
I'll go and see.
Natterer's Bat.
Did you hear me, Mrs Wilson?
I suppose you couldn't help it.
I came here by motor car.
I've left it exhausted alongside the gate.
- How far have you come?
- The last lap was nearly a mile.
- Bill about?
- Yes. Do you want him?
Er, yes, I do rather.
- Well, he's working, you know.
- Yes, I know.
- He's...
- Working.
Come along.
- That noise was Captain Scott.
- Hello, Con.
- Hello, Bill.
- Haven't seen you lately.
You forget, Captain Scott's been on his honeymoon.
Well, as a matter of fact,
I've been rather busy, but we hope to have a honeymoon someday, somewhere.
Well, Con?
What's up?
Shackleton hasn't done it, Bill.
He nearly did but not quite.
I'm going back.
Shall we go in?
- Mind if I kick it up a bit?
- No, carry on. They're your boots.
How far did Shackleton get?
He got to within 90 miles of the Pole.
- Isn't 90 miles near enough?
- No.
Because it isn't it.
It's not the South Pole.
That's still there, waiting.
And, er, I think an Englishman should get there first.
Well, Bill? What do you say?
There's my work for the Grouse Commission.
That's no obstacle.
We shan't be leaving for at least a year.
I think my exploring days are over.
I don't want to get somewhere first just for the sake of doing it.
Now, if it had been a rather different proposition, if the idea was to go back and carry on all the jobs we started on the Discovery expedition...
But that is the idea, Bill. That's it.
We'll do better.
We'll work on the Barrier, on the mountains, right up to the Pole.
Ours will be the best equipped expedition.
Dozens of scientists under that most eminent of all scientists: Dr Wilson.
Yes, that is different!
Come with me, Bill.
I couldn't let him go without me, could I, Oriana?
No.
Thank you.
Well, I wonder if the motor will start.
Yes, I wonder. You can't possibly go without having something to eat.
No, of course not.
That's the fly you caught the two-pounder on, in the burn at Clachen.
- Remember?
- Yes.
It's a long time ago now.
Look, the gut's all perished.
So it is.
Oh, darling!
Darling!
- Morning, Teddy.
- Oh, good morning, sir.
What have you got there?
Well, it's a... It's a sort of cash chart.
That's the target, there's the date, sir, and the contributions coming in.
Hm. Long way to go yet.
Anything in the post?
Not much money but plenty of people.
"Dear and honoured sir,
"if I could be allowed to join your expedition
"I would even become a British subject."
Here's one from a Bluecoat boy. He says,
"It's frightfully cold in my dormitory so I'm sure I should be all right."
Let him down lightly. Anything else?
No big cheque, I'm afraid.
Oh, some details about your lecture tour, sir.
Excuse me, sir.
There's a young lady here about a dog.
A dog?
Oh, show her in, Caroline.
Name, please, Miss?
Helen Field.
- Chair, Teddy.
- Yes, sir.
Please sit down, Miss Field.
Thank you.
I've brought you the money for a sledge dog.
You said we might.
Anyone, I mean. In your appeal.
How very kind of you, Miss Field.
- My name is Scott.
- Yes, I know that.
And this is Lieutenant Evans, my second in command.
I didn't know that.
How are you? I hope you're well.
- How are you, Teddy?
- Oh, very well, thank you, indeed.
Look, here's the envelope with the money from the school.
And...
You know, Miss Field, when business firms send us cheques, we're pleased enough, but somehow this means more.
Please thank them tremendously.
- Tell me, how many are there?
- 300, nearly.
Well, please thank them all.
We intend to call the dogs by the names of any schools that give them.
Rugby, Fettes, that sort of thing.
What's the name of your school?
South Hampstead High School for Girls.
Yes. I think we'd better just call him Hampstead.
Thank you for having turned out on such a dirty night to hear this talk.
During the past few days
I have had the pleasure, or rather, I should say, the great pleasure of addressing meetings like this all over the country.
And knowing, as I do, the rivalry that exists among our towns and cities
I am hoping that, as the result of this rivalry,
I shall be able to report to my committee in London that your city has gone one, if not a great deal, better than your fellow cities.
Um, thank you.
Well, I'm sure we're all very grateful to Captain Scott for coming and giving us this illuminating account of the Antarctic and I'm sure that if anyone wants to ask any questions
Captain Scott will be only too pleased to answer them.
Mr Chairman, I'm not averse to subscribing to anything that might be in the national interest, but it does occur to me to ask, why must this country send another expedition?
What about the Norwegians?
What about Nansen?
Nansen has given up polar exploration.
He's getting on, you know.
What about that other fellow?
Amundsen? He's making for the North Pole, not the South.
What's the difference?
What's the prospect of trade between this city and the South Pole?
Is there any coal down there, anything I can buy or sell?
I'm sorry we didn't raise more for you, but I suppose every penny counts.
Better luck somewhere else.
Are you sure I can't give you a lift?
It's not far out of my way.
No, please don't bother.
Well, then, I'll just wish you a good night and good luck.
Thank you. Good night.
Captain Scott?
Yes?
Glad I've caught you.
I've come from India.
Want to join your show, if you'll have me.
Good with horses.
Do you mean to tell me you've come 6,000 miles
- to join my expedition?
- Yes. Landed this morning.
- Who are you?
- My name's Oates.
- I'm with the Inniskillings.
- Hm.
No sense in getting soaked, is there?
That's better.
- Cavalryman, eh?
- Yes, sir, dragoons.
- Know anything about the Antarctic?
- Only what I've read.
When I saw you were taking ponies,
I thought perhaps I'd come in handy.
- Fit?
- As a fiddle.
- Age?
- Married?
- No.
- It will be tough.
- I know.
- As Hades.
- But not so warm, eh?
But I think we can manage it.
- We?
- That's what I said.
- Do you mean you'll take me?
- Glad to.
- You're on the strength.
- I say.
- Here's a tram. Come on.
- I say, just a moment.
This any good?
- This is for £1,000.
- Yes. Any good?
'Instead of sitting waiting for the money to come in,
'I'm taking the opportunity of trying out my motor sledges.'
You see the idea, Dr Nansen?
The wheels make their own road as it goes along.
- What do you think of it?
- Yes, what do you think?
I'm afraid Dr Nansen doesn't like motors, dear.
That is so.
I like dogs.
I can't help feeling that we should use every modern invention that comes along.
Somebody's got to try these things out.
I even thought of taking a wireless telegraph apparatus, but it's too heavy.
You are right, Captain, but I like dogs.
Yes, yes, that's what Amundsen says too.
I've been hearing about his plans for the North Pole.
Amundsen's a pupil of mine, as you might say, so of course he believes in dogs.
Well, perhaps I'm prejudiced, but I should hate to repeat the experience I had on the Discovery expedition.
You see, we look on dogs rather differently, more as... well, more as friends.
Captain, a friend in need is a friend indeed.
This Antarctic of yours is a cold and cruel place.
Even worse than the North.
A dog is an animal.
When a dog is finished, he is still some use to other dogs, and even to man if need be.
That machine of yours, when it is finished, it's just a heap of metal in the snow.
You cannot eat it.
That's true, and I am not forgetting the lessons of the past, but I want to take the new things as well.
I shall take dogs, ponies and motors.
Well, I would take dogs, dogs and dogs.
Hello, Bill. Morning, Cherry.
- Morning.
- Good to see you.
- How's Kathleen?
- Splendid. Come along in.
- Morning, Atch.
- And the baby?
Peter? Wonderful, bald as a coot.
Morning, sir.
I'd know that mug anywhere.
Come out of it, Taff Evans.
I was rather surprised you didn't apply to come with me again this time, Evans.
Didn't have to, sir.
I knew you'd send for me sooner or later.
My release is through at last.
I'm afraid there's no hurry, Bill.
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Teddy.
Have a look at that.
At the rate the money's coming in, you could go on carving up grouse till Christmas.
Rather depressing. Time's getting on.
And none of us are getting any younger. not to make any more appointments.
He turned up from the Persian Gulf this morning, sir.
I couldn't say you wouldn't see him.
Indian Marine Lieutenant.
Doesn't say how old he is.
26, sir.
Today as a matter of fact.
- May I come in, sir?
- Well, you are in, aren't you?
There's more to come, sir, with permission.
- The door was open, sir.
- True.
I heard my name and I think I did mention my age, sir.
There, sir, 26.
Is that real or something you stuffed inside your coat?
Quite real, sir.
Hm. Bill, how's this?
Well, I'd rather he hit Teddy than me.
- May he hit Teddy?
- Mm, I don't see why not.
Excuse me, sir, but I'm a good deal senior to Bowers.
Pity.
- Sit down, Bowers.
- Thank you, sir.
Why do you want to join this show?
I suppose you want to be among the first to reach the Pole. Is that it?
- Out for a bit of white ribbon, eh?
- No, sir.
I know it sounds stupid to say I want adventure, but, er...
What do you mean by adventure?
Well, sir, to get some extra knowledge of the stars and land and weather and...
And?
Other men's jobs.
Well, Bowers, to date we've had 6,042 applications.
I'm afraid I've made up my mind we can't take anybody else.
Hello? Oh, good morning, Sir Clements.
What?
The grant is through.
How much?
I see. Yes, yes, of course.
Well, thank you very much for letting us know at once.
Yes. Goodbye, sir.
- How much?
- A lot short of what we wanted.
- Yes, but it makes it just possible.
We shall have to cut down a bit, that's all.
- How about my side of things?
- Don't worry.
I won't cut a penny on your side.
I promised you the greatest scientific expedition that ever left England.
- How on earth will we do it?
- One ship instead of two. There she is.
We can go, Bill. We're going.
What do you want?
Oh, yes, I was just going to kick you out, wasn't I?
- Yes, sir.
- Yes.
Well, I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll take you. How's that?
- Thank you, sir.
- Right.
- Oh, Bowers.
- Yes, sir?
- Many happy returns.
- Thank you very much, sir.
'The first leg of our journey, halfway round the world.'
Cherry.
Just a minute, son. Just a minute.
Excuse me, sir.
Oi, Jehu, stop it!
Could you tell me where Captain Scott is, please?
That's right, sonny. You come to Uncle.
He's a Russian, he don't understand.
Ah, this is for the owner. Up there.
Not on the bridge, on the poop deck.
Telegram, Captain Scott.
Oh? Oh, thank you.
Thanks.
- Any message for Peter?
- Tell him I'll bring him a penguin.
Excuse me.
Good bye.
God bless and keep you, my dearest, until...
All visitors ashore! Come along, please!
Think of me when you make those footmarks.
Every step of the way.
Up gangway!
Hold on!
All right, carry on.
This is a bit thick, thousands of miles from the nearest bookie.
- What's up?
- Red-hot tip for the National.
- Is that a race?
- A race? Why...
Hook, line and sinker!
- Hard luck, Titus.
- Thank you.
The Grouse Commission are thinking of us.
- Splendid.
- They don't say what, of course.
Here's a good one, sir.
"Love to Hampstead and kind regards to the rest of you,
"Helen Fields."
Oh, wait a minute.
I've got another one here somewhere.
"I'm going south, Amundsen."
- South?
- But I thought it was understood.
- Everyone thought it was understood.
- I can't believe it.
It's perfectly true. Read it yourself.
From Madeira. That means he's started.
- Why didn't he tell anyone?
- Not very sporting.
He's changed his mind.
Anyone's allowed to change his mind.
He was going north, now he's going south.
That's all.
It means a lot to you, doesn't it, getting there first?
Of course it does.
You know damn well it does.
The Antarctic's a big enough thing to be up against without this fellow butting in.
Why has he suddenly changed his mind?
He's trying to make a race of it and we're not rigged for racing.
Quite, Con, quite.
What on earth would you do with all us scientists?
We'd be falling over each other.
You're right, Bill. You're right.
This is a scientific expedition.
I am not going to be stampeded and I am not going to take any risks.
In fact, I'm not going to race.
I wonder what route the blighter's taking.
'Wonderful to be free at last from problems so difficult to handle.
'Whatever lies ahead,
I am now on my own ground.'
There you are, sir. The Great Ice Barrier.
400 miles long and 100 foot high.
'This is obviously the best place,
'a sloping shore and a good stretch of bay ice.'
Steady, keep her straight on the lines.
Mush! Mush!
'With ponies, motor sledges, dogs and men parties,
'we've done an excellent job of transporting.
'Bowers proves a perfect treasure.
'There's not a single case he doesn't know
'or a single article which he cannot find at once.
'So, we are landed and the hut is up eight days after our arrival.
'A very good record.'
Sir.
- What is it, McKenzie?
- Beg pardon, sir.
We were wondering if you'd take old puss with you to the Pole, sir.
- Sure to show up well against the snow.
- Yes, sir.
Hear, hear, sir.
He'd show up well anywhere.
No, no, it's very good of you fellows to suggest it, but I mustn't take the luck from the ship.
- Great minds think alike, eh?
- Yes, sir.
- Goodbye, Pennell.
- Goodbye, sir.
- Best of luck to you all.
- And to you.
Thanks. See you in about... well, a year's time.
Yes, sir.
'The ship will drop Campbell's party up the coast
'on her way back to New Zealand.
'What news shall we have for her when she returns next summer, I wonder.
'There is much for us all to do while the daylight lasts.
'When the sun does go, we shan't see him for half a year.'
Oi, oi, oi!
Hello.
Oi, don't go away.
Come back. There's nothing to worry about.
Well, the winter's almost on us now, and that means sitting tight here for the next six months.
Seems a good moment to run over what's ahead when the sun comes back.
This chart makes things pretty easy to understand, I think.
- Can you see all right at the back?
- Yes, thank you, sir.
We're here, just above the sea ice.
The first stage is the Great Ice Barrier.
About 400 miles to cross.
Then come mountains 9,000 feet high.
We get up them by the Beardmore Glacier.
There's over 100 miles of that.
Lastly, the plateau.
Another 350 miles along that to the Pole.
Now, about ways and means.
The secret of travel in the Antarctic is food and fuel.
Hot food will take a man further than cold food.
And remember, there's no such thing as living off the country.
Every ounce will have to be carried and depot'd all the way along the route to supply us on the way home.
Give me a hand with the other one, Bill, will you?
Now, you see these depots marked here?
Up to the last, One Ton.
These are the ones we put down this summer in order to save weight next summer.
Beyond, on the outward journey, the southern party will put down more depots every so often.
The whole resources of the entire party will be devoted to getting four men into a position from which they can make their final bid for the Pole.
Outward to the foot of the glacier, tractors, ponies and dogs will haul as much as they can as far as they can.
From then on, we'll ask no more of machines and animals.
It'll be up to us.
From the glacier to the Pole and all the way back, man-hauling.
Now, the time margin is very small.
We've found already that our ponies can't stand the lowest temperatures.
So it will mean starting later than I'd hoped.
And we shall have to move faster than Shackleton did to have any chance of reaching the Pole and getting back.
Getting back, mark you, before the darkness and winter blizzards set in again.
Now, is that all clear? Any questions?
- I know one I'd like to ask him.
- Which four, eh?
It's the ship. She's back.
- What's the trouble, Pennell?
- Came across Amundsen.
- Where?
- Bay of Whales.
The Bay of Whales, eh?
400 miles away.
That's practically next door out here.
- How many men has he got with him?
- Only 19 all told, sir.
He has more than 100 dogs.
Never seen so many dogs.
He's got some cheek.
We found this place first.
Fellow has a million miles of ice to choose from and he has to pick ours.
Ah, well, the Antarctic's big enough.
Right, Pennell. Thanks for the news.
Now, you'd better get out again before the sea freezes over.
I shall be glad when we've finished with the Pole and we can get down to some real work, won't you, Bill?
- Hot char anywhere?
- Oh, shut that door, Birdie!
- Giving tongue all right, aren't they?
- Mm.
Well, good night, all.
Good night, Ponko.
Brrrr!
Good night, Uncle Bill.
Good night, Atch.

Very good indeed. Very good, sir.
Gentlemen?
Mr Ponting will now recite.
All right, then.
Give us the doings, someone.
The Sleeping Bag, a poem.
Hurray!
On the outside grows the fur side
On the inside grows the skin side
So the fur side is the outside and the skin side is the inside
One side likes the skin side inside and the fur side on the outside
Others like the skin side outside and the fur side on the inside
If you turn the skin side outside, thinking you will side with that side
Then the soft side, fur side's inside, which, some argue, is the wrong side
If you turn the fur side outside as you say it grows on that side
Then your outside's next to the skin side which for comfort's not the right side
For the skin side is the cold side and your outside's not your warm side
And two cold sides side by side are not right sides, one side decides
If you decide to side with that side, turn the top side fur side inside
Then the cold side, hard side, skin side is beyond all question inside out
Well done that man! Well done that man!
Well done, Bowers!

Christopher, you're a toad.
Well, you're in good form, Soldier.
How about these fellows?
Not too dusty, considering.
Will they get us across the Barrier in the spring?
Can't say yet.
There's one or two
I'm a bit worried about.
Nobby's all right.
And so is James Pigg.
Old Jehu, I'm not so sure.
This fellow Amundsen, can he do it, do you think, just with dogs?
Can't say, Soldier, can't say.
These Norwegians are better with dogs than we are and... our using these chaps means making a later start.
His base is 80 miles nearer the Pole, but he'll be crossing unknown country.
Seems to me it all depends on whether he finds another way up to the plateau.
It's just a matter of luck.
But they're tough people, Soldier.
No doubt about that.
'It's glorious to stand bathed in brilliant sunshine once more.
'The future is in the lap of the gods.
'I can think of nothing left undone to deserve success.'
- Come along, Crean.
- Just a minute, sir.
Hurry up, Ponko.
- Hurry up, Teddy.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Right, Lashly. Let's have another go.
Right-oh, Teddy.
Good luck. Right-oh, Day.
Come on, the Baltic Fleet.
'The slowest ponies first
'with Atkinson, Wright, Keohane.'
Birdie!
'Bowers, Crean, Cherry-Garrard.
'Evans with Snatcher.
'Evans is a tower of strength, as sound and as hard as ever.
'Wilson with Nobby.
'Oates with Christopher,
'the biggest handful of the lot.
'And myself with Snippetts.'
Good luck!
'16 men all told.
'Four days out, all ponies going well.'
Mush! Mush!
Mush! Mush!
'There's nothing like Antarctic air for sharpening the appetite.
'We're always ready for our mug of pemmican hoosh,
'followed by tea or cocoa.'
Here you are, Stareek.
Hampstead!
"Just a heap of metal in the snow."
There's still the other one.
I hope so, Bill. I certainly hope so.
I'm afraid that's it, sir.
Well, we'll just have to man-haul our load till the others catch us up.
'Both motors have fallen out.
'Now all depends on the ponies.'
Whoa, back!
Whoa, Christopher! Whoa, back!
'We've taken to marching by the midnight sun,
'so that the ponies get rested at the warmest time of the day.'
Sir, I've been totting up on the hay we have aboard.
Is none of them ponies coming back?
Afraid not, Crean.
Soon meat, Stareek.
Much meat.
Fresh meat.
'We are now more than halfway to the glacier,
'but it's still rather touch and go with the ponies.'
There it is.
Hey, Teddy!
Teddy!
Sir.
Congratulations.
150 miles since the motors let you down.
- Well done, the lot of you.
- Thank you.
Will they manage it, Soldier?
Shall we get them as far as the glacier?
Old Jehu's about done, I'm afraid.
Still, he's paid his way.
It's strange, but when I write to Oriana,
I can see so clearly the place the letter's going to.
I mean, where she is.
But her face itself is always misty.
Yes.
Yes, I know what you mean.
When I try to see Kathleen there's always some feature
I can't quite get.
Very odd that. I feel just the same about an old horse of mine.
I can see the paddock all right, but can't get the old chap's muzzle.
Well, this is as far as we go together.
- Thank you, Day. Thank you, Hooper.
- Thank you, sir.
- Goodbye.
- Good luck, sir.
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.
- Don't forget the letters, Day.
- No, sir.
- Ready?
- Right.
- Goodbye, you fellows.
- Goodbye.
Jehu.
Atch.
'The blizzard has lost us five days already
'and we are now well behind Shackleton's time.
'We must get the ponies on a little further.'
We can't be far from the glacier now, but wherever we are, this is the finish.
Crean.
Birdie!
Now, Christopher, old man.
Look!
Well, they did it.
I congratulate you, Titus.
And I thank you, Titus.
The glacier tomorrow, Bill.
- Dimitri?
- Sir?
Here's the mail.
Goodbye and good luck.
Goodbye, sir.
Good luck.
- Goodbye, Dimitri.
- Goodbye, Ruski.
- Good luck, boy.
- Dos vedanya!
Mush! Mush!
Well, goodbye, Meares.
Have a good run home.
Thank you, sir, and the best of luck to you.
Thanks.
Mush!
Goodbye, sir.
Goodbye, Mother Meares.
'12 men with three sledges, man-hauling.'
Brandy, Uncle Bill? What's this for?
The use of that, my dear Titus, is purely medicinal.
Kindly hand it to me.
'We've climbed 4,000 feet.
'We've been toiling for five days but are barely halfway up.
'Surely we were right not to bring the dogs on.'
Halt.
That way.
Aye, aye, sir.
Ready? Heave.
Ready?
Heave.
Birdie?
Better leave a flag here.
Seems to be a good way up.
Aye, aye, sir.
See that nunatak?
That's what Shackleton called
Buckley Island.
Top of the glacier, sir?
Yes, that's right. Our last big climb.
At this rate, sir, we should be at the top in time for our Christmas dinner.
That's right, Lashly.
Merry Christmas is the word.
Take the strain, Crean.
Toss him a line, Birdie.
- You all right, Lashly?
- Yes, sir.
Sure to be. It's my birthday too.
Many happy returns, Lashly.
Right, Birdie.
Right, Crean. Bowline.
Heave.
Bowline.
Taff, caramel?
Thank you, sir.
- Con?
- Thank you, Bill.
- Atch?
- Thank you, Uncle Bill.
Soldier, you're a marvel.
Well, Christmas comes but once a year.
Christmas comes and Atch goes, eh?
Yes, worst luck.
Thank you.
Pemmican and pony?
How do you do it, Titus?
Perfectly simple.
Been giving you short rations all week.
Oh!
- Well, it was worth it.
- Thank you, sir.
Atch.
Yes?
What do you have to have to be given brandy?
Leprosy.
Plague.
Or just an ordinary fit.
- Fit, eh?
- Hm.
- Er, more, sir?
- Oh, thanks.
- Oh, sorry, sir.
- That's all right, Atch.
We are a bit crowded in here tonight.
We ought to eat by numbers.
- Don't put too much faith in numbers.
- Carry on, Evans.
- Story coming.
- Well, hardly a story exactly, sir.
But I remember when we was at Whale Island, we had a PO gunnery instructor.
He was on one of them guns with the new-fangled breech action.
Good, but tricky.
You had to press the button near the breech with your left thumb and then whang in the block with your right hand.
Trouble was, some on the course gets so excited, they gets the movements too close together.
In goes the block and off comes the top of their thumb.
This PO gets tired of seeing a lot of people wandering about with no tops to their thumbs and he calls the class together and he says, "Now, listen, you flat-footed soldiers.
"Let's have no more of this.
"I'll demonstrate the drill to you slowly, by numbers.
"One, I opens the breech.
"Two, I presses the button with my left thumb.
"And three, I sends home the block with my right hand.
"And that's how you lose the top of your bloody thumb."
Keep back! Keep back!
Oh! Brandy!
Brandy! Brandy!
- That's out of date, Titus.
- Brandy.
This is the modern treatment.
No, Uncle Bill! Uncle Bill, stop it!
No, stop it!
No!
'9,000 feet up,
'the Barrier and the glacier behind us.
'It should be level-going now, all the way to our goal.'
- Goodbye, Atch.
- Goodbye, sir.
- Look out for us in March.
- Right.
With any luck, we'll be back before the ship has to go.
- I hope I haven't disappointed you.
- No, no, Cherry.
It was a sheer toss-up whether you or Titus went on from here.
- Was it really?
- Mm.
- Who's going to go on the last lap?
- I don't suppose it's settled yet.
Four out of the eight of us.
We're all hoping.
Ready?
Heave.
- Goodbye, boys.
- Goodbye, Ted.
- Goodbye, boys.
- Goodbye, you fellows.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Atch.
'Eight men with two sledges, man-hauling.'
- This wind!
- Help us on the way back, though.
Hardest decision of the lot, Bill.
And the one where you can't help me.
Can we depot our skis here, sir?
Help lighten our sledge.
Yes, all right.
Leave your lot here.
The return party can pick them up.
Whoever they are.
We'll make our lunch camp here, let you get ahead a bit.
'Is my team the best?
'Is it?
'Are we all at our best?
'Bill and I? Yes, all right, that's two.
'And Taff Evans, of course.
'Soldier? Soldier too, then. All right.
'Our four.
'Our four.
'What about Teddy's?'
Halt.
Carry on, Bill.
Ready?
Heave.
'The best four men.
'The best... Who are the best four?
Teddy?
'Birdie?
'Lashly?
'Crean?'
Last letters home go tomorrow.
You're too big, both of you.
What the Captain wants is a middler, about 5' 8".
- And what might you be?
Oh!
Here comes the Captain.
Well done, lads. First-class job.
Lashly, Crean.
It's only fair to tell you now that you'll not be coming on with us.
I'm very sorry indeed.
You've done splendidly and I shall never forget it.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
And me, sir?
- You'll be coming on.
- Thank you, sir.
Good for you, Taff.
You're a lucky devil, Taff.
You always were.
Teddy?
Yes, sir?
About tomorrow.
I've given a lot of thought to the matter, and I've decided that my four should go on.
I see, sir.
There's one other thing.
I want to take Bowers.
If you can spare him.
- Five, sir?
- Yes.
Right.
And, Teddy?
Sorry.
Thank you, sir.
I'm taking five, Bill.
- Five?
- Yes, you, me, Bowers, Oates and Taff Evans as the strongest and biggest.
A scientist, two sailors and a soldier.
What better companions could a man have, eh?
'Dear Kathleen,
'a last note from a hopeful position.
'I think it's going to be all right.'
- Goodbye, Crean.
- Goodbye, Lashly. Best of luck.
- Goodbye, Lashly.
- Goodbye, sir.
Well, Teddy, we couldn't have got this far without you.
Thank you, sir, and good luck.
Thanks. See you sometime in March, eh?
Ready?
Heave.
Let's give them a cheer, lads.
- Hurray!
- Hurray!
'Five men with one sledge,
'man-hauling.
'This surface is horrible.
'Crystals like sand.
'Bowers on foot has the hardest time of it,
'but he's an undefeated little sportsman.'
- Not ready yet, Titus?
- No, not yet.
Latitude 88:25, sir.
- Farthest south, eh?
- Good-oh.
- Beyond Shackleton at last.
- That's great, sir.
Something the matter with your hand?
Only a cut, sir. It's nothing.
I heals easy.
At least, I do at home.
'Cooking for five takes a seriously longer time than cooking for four.
'It's an item I had not considered when reorganising.'
'Can we keep up these marches?
'It's a critical time.
'But we ought to do the trick.'
How far now, sir?
About 27 miles, two good marches.
I'm sorry but my sleeping bag is not on the sledge.
Halt.
It can't have fallen further back than our last halt.
May I go, sir?
I'm coming with you.
Can't trust myself to speak, sir.
Well, don't, then, Taff.
'We only had to go back a couple of miles,
'but it cost us two whole hours.'
Can't be more than five miles now, sir.
Sir.
There.
Amundsen.
Look.
Well, I suppose it was meant to be.
They've left their names.
There were five of them, apparently.
And there's a letter for the King of Norway with a note asking Captain Scott to be so kind as to deliver it.
He's forgotten to stamp it.
Birdie, you'd better check the position.
'The Pole.
'Yes, but under very different circumstances from those expected.
'It's a bitter disappointment,
'and I am very sorry for my loyal companions.'
Smile, please.
'The wind is blowing hard,
'and there is that curious damp feeling in the air which chills one to the bone.
'Great God, this is an awful place.'
'January 18th. All the daydreams must go.
'Now for the run home and a desperate struggle.
'I wonder if we can do it.'
Cherry asked me to give you this at the Pole.
Well done that man.
Sorry you chaps don't like chocolate.
- Soldier.
- Thank you, sir.
- Bill.
- Thank you.
- Birdie.
- Thank you, sir.
- Evans.
- Thank you, sir.
That hand still bothering you?
Hardly at all now, sir.
Well, lads, only 900 miles to go.
Ready?
Heave.
Ready?
Heave.
This is better, eh?
Birdie?
Your skis must be round here somewhere.
- Keep an eye open for them.
- Aye, aye, sir.
'The wind is playing strange tricks.
'Instead of blowing steadily northward, as it did when we came,
'it keeps dropping and leaving us the full weight of the sledge.'
Land-ho!
'I don't like the easy way
Oates and Evans get frostbitten.'
- Sir?
- Mm?
- You know where Teddy turned back.
- Yes. What about it?
According to that note of his, we've done the same distance half a day better.
Half a day. Do you hear that, Soldier?
We're half a day better than Teddy.
Good-oh!
A day's march nearer home, Birdie.
A day's march nearer steaks.
Large, thick, juicy, sizzly ones.
Oh, don't.
With mushrooms.
And beer.
And beer?
Beer of course, gallons of it.
Had an awful nightmare the other night, Birdie.
Dreamt that Simpson's had been burnt down.
Hello, Bill. What have you got this time?
Quite an interesting day.
This hoosh smells good. Yours, Con?
Birdie reckons we've done half a day's better time than Teddy did.
Good, good.
What are these, Bill?
Sea plants mostly, and some tree fossils.
Good heavens. This must have been quite a warm spot once upon a time.
And look at this.
Coal, by Jove.
"What's the prospect of trade between this city and the Antarctic?"
Coal, Evans. Catch.
Ooh!
- What's the matter, man?
- It's nothing, sir.
Quite all right.
Only a bit awkward, that's all.
'I am indeed glad to think that we've done with the plateau.
'Another week of those conditions might have had a very bad effect on Evans.'
See your flag anywhere, Birdie?
No sign of it, sir.
We'll try a bit back and to the right.
Evans, off with your harness.
Take the aft end of the sledge.
Understand?
Aye, aye, sir.
'There is no doubt
Evans is a good deal run down.
'I think Wilson, Bowers and I are as fit as possible,
'but Oates feels the cold and fatigue more than we do.'
Look out, steady!
There it is, sir. There's the flag.
A shadow.
'Evans keeps saying, as he would, that he's quite well.
'How can a man be quite well with hands like that?'
Halt.
Can't be far now.
Birdie, try up that hill.
See if you can see the cairn.
Right, sir.
What's wrong, Evans?
It's loose, sir. It's come loose, sir.
Have it right in a moment.
Hold on. I'll do it.
You get your harness off.
It's only my old hand, sir.
Makes me a bit slow.
I can't see the cairn, but I can see the Barrier.
How's that?
Try and move your foot.
- Sure you can manage?
- I'll be fine, sir.
That's the man, Taff. Take your time.
We'll be camping soon.
Ready? Heave.
Halt.
What is it, Taff?
I'm all right, sir, quite well.
Taff?
'It is a terrible thing to lose a companion in this way,
'to leave him here after all the miles we've sledged together.'
Plateau done, glacier done.
400 miles of Barrier and we're home.
We've got to do more miles a day, Bill.
We ought to find it warmer down here, anyhow.
Sir.
60 degrees of frost.
Can't last.
'Only five miles again yesterday.
'This will never do.'
Ready?
No, no, no.
Tortoise beat the hare in the end.
Right, Soldier?
Ready, sir.
Heave.
'There is no getting away from the fact that we are not going strong.
'And I'm afraid Soldier's foot is bad.'
When I get home,
I'm never going to walk another step.
- Ride wherever I go.
- Even in London?
London.
- Know the Empire promenade, Birdie?
- Funny thing, I've never been.
First night home, I'll be there.
You must take me with you, Titus.
But you'll have to leave your horse outside.
I ought to tell you that we haven't too much fuel in hand.
If we're still short at Mount Hooper, we'll try going on cold meals.
We may have no choice.
Funny, used to have what they call a good leg for a boot.
Wouldn't think it now, would you, Bill?
Bill, what chance have I got?
A good one, Titus.
How far is it to Mount Hooper depot now?
Eight and a half miles.
We'll do it in no time, Soldier.
Purely medicinal.
'What shall we find at Mount Hooper depot?
'If oil is short again...'
There she is.
See, old chap?
Managed it all right.
- Wasn't so bad.
- Get the spades, Birdie.
Here it is.
It's not full.
The seal's not broken.
Odd things happen out here.
It must be evaporation.
Yes, but...
Come on, chaps.
No good arguing the whys and wherefores.
Up tent.
'Among ourselves we are unendingly cheerful.
'But what each man feels in his heart,
I can only guess.'
Letting up a little, I think.
I hope I don't wake tomorrow, Bill.
I'm just going outside.
I may be away some time.
'A brave man and a gallant gentleman.
'This intense cold convinces me
'that the season has broken far earlier than I expected.'
We'll be all right at One Ton.
It's full of stuff.
I thought for a moment it might be old Titus.
Stupid of me.
Sorry.
Only 11 miles now, Bill. Two good marches.
One if the snow holds off.
'Captain Scott is now lying in this tent with a frozen foot.
'I am afraid he will never walk again.
'If the wind drops,
'Birdie and I are going to try to reach the next depot and return.
'We have come together
'1,800 miles,
'and are now only 11 miles from stores in plenty.
'Only 11 miles.'
11 miles.
11 miles.
'Think of me when you make those footmarks.'
'Every step of the way.'
'My own dearest mother,
'I should so like to have come through for your dear sake.
'It is splendid to pass, however,
'with such companions as I have.
'And as all five of us have mothers and wives,
'you will not be alone.
'There will be no shame
'and you will know
I have struggled to the end,
'your ever loving son,
'to the end of this life and the next,
'when God shall wipe away all tears from our eyes.'
'God knows I am sorry to be the cause of sorrow
'to anyone in the world.
'But everyone must die.
'All the things I had hoped to do with you after the expedition
'are as nothing now.
'My only regret is leaving you to struggle through your life alone.
'All is for the best to those who love God.
'And, oh, my Ori, we have both loved him with all our lives.
'All is well.'
'For my own sake,
I do not regret this journey.
'We took risks. We knew we took them.
'Things have come out against us.
'And therefore we have no cause for complaint.
'Had we lived,
'I should have had a tale to tell
'of the hardihood, endurance and courage of my companions,
'which would have stirred the heart of every Englishman.
'It seems a pity,
'but I don't think I can write more.
'These rough notes and our dead bodies
'must tell the tale.
'For God's sake,
'look after our people.'
Halt.
This Alfonso d'Este, do they say how big he is?
Yes. They say he's over six feet tall.
A giant of a man.
A respectful silence is the least you can offer your dead husband.
Would you say the dead man made a reluctant corpse?
A loose tongue soon loses its mouth, Captain Orsini.
A wise tongue never needs to repeat itself, Don Esteban... nor does a competent assassin.
Duke Cesare.
We have suffered a most tragic loss.
My dear sister Lucrezia's broken with grief.
The court will observe a proper period of mourning.
- How long, de Lorqua?
- One year, my lord Cesare.
One month.
The dead must not place too great a burden on the living.
It's my belief that everything, even death, can be turned into profit.
Our armies hold Pesaro,
Rimini, Forlì.
We're on the road to Urbino, Bologna, Siena.
All Tuscany, the center of Italy from coast to coast will be ours.
Then inevitably, Milan... and Venice.
But this devil-begotten Ferrara stands blocking our progress.
You, Gravina, you're the military genius.
- How would you take it?
- Perhaps with 10,000 troops.
Or a woman.
We will walk into Ferrara through a bedroom.
By arranging a marriage between my recently widowed sister Lucrezia... and, uh, Alfonso, the servant of Duke d'Este.
Your Lordship knows that Duke d'Este is negotiating such a marriage with the French king.
Alfonso's a blacksmith.
He needs a lusty woman... not one of those frail, French birds.
And who will convey this delicate information?
Who?
Who but a man as quick at deceit as a fox.
He must have the grace of a dancer, the wrist of an assassin.
He must have little regard for good faith.
Yet by his astuteness, be able to confuse men's minds.
He must have confidence
in himself.'...
yet not permit that confidence
to render him incautious.
He must charm as a snake charms a bird... yet he must make no friends... except those that can be of use to him.
And for the same reason, although we make use of love...
he must not love.
You may go now, all of you, except...
Andrea Orsini.
You question me?
Then go!
You're pleased with my choice?
I have never questioned
Your Lordship's judgment.
- Don Esteban was annoyed.
- Don Esteban is easily annoyed.
Don't underestimate him, Andrea.
Remember, that in this race for glory... he's always just behind you ready to pass you if you should lose a single step.
I have learned that if my wits are quick, my feet will be quick enough.
You've learned something else today?
Why your sister's husband was sent to another world.
One life is little enough to pay for all Ferrara.
So long as it's not mine.
Drink.
You are a complete rogue.
I need someone that can follow my mind... who can keep his eyes fixed on the ultimate goal— one Italy... one kingdom, one king—
Cesare Borgia.
Think of it— chief minister to a great new kingdom.
What prize on earth could equal it?
But the great know only one law— the outcome justifies the act.
Have you the stomach for greatness?
The stomach and the appetite.
Then bring me Alfonso d'Este's promise to marry Lucrezia... and I'll be certain of it.
Your Lordship will find me a most efficient Cupid.
Try some of your shafts on my cousin, Angela.
She's waiting for you.
No.
That way.
De Lorqua.
Captain Orsini leaves tomorrow for Ferrara.
He travels by way of Venice.
Arrange the necessary passage.
Yes, Duke Cesare.
Angela.
Oh, Angela, my love. I've been commissioned to leave immediately for Ferrara.
Yes, I know.
It will take you away from me, and yet you are pleased.
Only because the reward is great.
Oh, I love you.
I love you, Andrea.
But I don't trust you.
You're too ambitious.
If I'm ambitious, it's only to make myself worthy of your love.
For without your love,
I'm nothing.
What do you think of that?
Good. Very good.
It's not signed.
Did you paint it?
Would it be any better if it were signed Leonardo da Vinci?
- It would be worth more.
- Never mind.
It's not for sale.
I need it in my business.
But... what do you think of this?
Ah. A gem!
A rare gem!
- It's not signed either.
- It doesn't need to be.
Will you sell it?
I might.
I will, uh, risk, uh, 50 ducats.
I risked my life.
- Let Cesare Borgia pay for that.
- He does, in opportunities.
How I die is his problem.
How I live is my own.
- Uh, 60.
- I'm a poor man on an expensive mission.
Seventy-five, and that's my last offer.
My lowest price is 100 ducats, and only out of love for you.
- Ninety.
- It's worth more than that to me.
I'll buy your painting.
Madonna Camilla.
What an honor!
What a delight. Your Signora drops like an ángel from heaven.
To find you bargaining like a fishwife.
Not for myself, but for a client.
Oh, then it's worth the price?
No doubt, if beauty has a price.
Will you let me have this for 100 ducats?
Please?
Accept it as a tribute to your own beauty.
You mean that you'll give me this beautiful thing?
If Your Highness would honor me.
Well, did you hear that?
And he doesn't even know me.
You have greatness of soul, Messer.
I will hang it in a place of honor in my own bedroom... where it will always recall your generosity to me and to my good husband.
Well, Messer, have you nothing appropriate to say?
Forgive my silence.
I— I was just thinking... with envy and admiration of your husband.
I was also deploring the fact that while
Your Highness has a memento of our meeting...
I have nothing.
You're not hinting for a gift in return?
"Hinting" is hardly the word for it.
But I—
There.
I will keep this as a saint's relic... in memory of the divine hand that wore it.
Master da Pavia, isn't it time you presented this gentleman?
Magnifico Andrea Orsini, captain to His Excellency, Duke Cesare Borgia.
Oh, then I know your kinsman.
- The cardinal, the duke of Gravina.
- Distant kinsman.
My family is of Naples.
My great uncle was Raimondo Orsini, count of Nola.
Oh, indeed. Now, will you please present me?
I have the honor to present
Camilla degli Baglioni... wife of His Excellency,
Marc Antonio Verano...
Iord of Città del Monte.
Who is very pleased to have exchanged souvenirs with you.
Would you do my husband and me the honor of waiting on us?
Well, unfortunately,
I leave for Ferrara.
You go alone?
Armed with an olive branch.
- A pleasant journey, Messer Orsini.
- Madame. Messer.
How long have you known this gentleman?
Oh, three years about.
What do you make of him?
A soldier who knows art... an Orsini unrelated to the Orsini... a servant of the Borgias going alone to Borgia's enemies.
He has too many faces.
I find him interesting.
I hope you may not find him dangerous,
Madonna. He drives a hard bargain.
Grazie.
- Don't be a fool! Don't be a fool!
- Fool to kill you?
If you kill me, you'll never know why I attacked you.
Get up.
On your feet.
Walk in front of me toward the light.
Ah, a face like yours shouldn't be hidden in the dark.
- It's beautiful.
- It's been called everything but that.
Oh, only by the unartistic.
Oh, there's— there's design in your face.
A hundred twisted
curves and angles... tortured into a pattern of exquisite evil.
And you have beautiful and artistic hands.
That face, those hands, your voice and manner of speaking.
You are, of course, of gentle birth.
What does my birth got to do with you?
I like to know something about the people I deal with.
Why rake over the past of a hired assassin?
Because it may determine our future.
Now tell me, who employed you to assassinate me?
- I never sell my wares until I know the price.
- How much is your life worth?
- Why?
- 'Cause that's all I promise to pay.
Now you're unarmed and I'm not squeamish.
Besides, you deserve to die.
Well, I'm, uh— I'm waiting for a fresh topic of conversation.
Did I hear you say Duke d'Este paid you to draw my blood?
- In advance.
- How much?
- You were expensive.
- They paid without bargaining?
Yes. You're distinctly not wanted in Ferrara.
Do you know why?
I never cut a throat without knowing whose it is or why I'm cutting it.
The mere idea of a marriage between
Alfonso d'Este and Lucrezia Borgia... blisters their pride.
The lady's had too public a life.
Well, having lost you one employment,
I should find you another.
Your game?
It amuses me to think of entering Ferrara... the master of the man who was hired to kill me.
Such insolence is stimulating. But have you thought of what will happen to me?
The same thing that'll happen to me.
We live or die together. And I intend to live.
I'll bear your service while the bond lasts, and warn you when I'm quitting.
Fair enough.
Let's to bed. We leave in the early morning for Ferrara.
There's a fine inn at Crespino with a beautiful kitchen.
Would Your Lordship wish to spend the night there?
No. That's a prosperous looking farm.
Why shouldn't it be?
That's the widow Zoppo's farm.
Why do you turn down
your nose at it?
Ah, to answer that
would be really a story.
There was the father,
a blacksmith... and his good wife,
Mona Maria.
They had a son who was more than bright.
So, the poor, foolish parents saved their money... to send him to Padua to study with the great masters.
Some six years ago, he disappeared.
The next we heard, he had become a bandit down south in the Regno.
- The father's dead, huh?
- Yes, almost two years.
They say from a broken heart.
The old lady lives alone?
Yes, and keeps her thoughts to herself.
Only the old woman and God know how much gold she has hid away.
Every ducat of it stolen
by her bandit son.
Where does she hide her gold?
Who knows where an old woman hides her gold?
In pots buried in the earth... in sugar bowls, under her bed, in her skirts.
Women can find always places to confound a man.
They spend their lives
confounding us.
We'll stop tonight at Crespino.
Yes, Your Excellency.
Who is it?
What do you want?
Keep out of my house!
- Andrea.
- Oh, Mammina.
My boy!
My boy, my boy, my boy.
Thank God you've come home to me.
Let me look at you.
Let me—
My goodness, just like a gentleman... with a sword... and real fur on his collar and a red hat.
So beautiful.
No, you're the one who's beautiful.
You haven't changed a bit.
No, thanks to you.
For six years
I worry and wait and wait.
Mammina, you're not going to waste our precious time scolding me.
- How soon must you go?
- Sunrise.
Oh, Furio. Stop it!
- Someone outside?
- Oh, no. Rabbits, mice, cats.
A widow's dog never rests.
- I know, Mammina.
- He had great hopes for you.
If only he could have waited.
I do well now, I assure you.
Quiet, Furio! Stop it.
Come, sit down.
Do all painters wear swords and red hats?
I live by a different art now.
Yes. People call me
the mother of a bandit.
Perhaps they're right.
But at least no common bandit. I work for one who dreams of stealing all Italy.
His name is Cesare Borgia.
You devil.
Why didn't you tell me that before?
Because you would have taken the money
I sent you and come to Rome to see me.
- Are you ashamed of your mother?
- No, but you'd never have found me.
- Why not?
- Well, I have another name now.
Why?
Names are important, Mammina, to open certain doors.
The one I took belongs to the dead branch of a famous family.
What name?
I can't tell you that yet.
But it's brought me good luck.
I am at home in many great palaces.
There's a title in the offing... a great marriage, the founding of a princely house.
What do you say to that?
When you, my son, Andrea Zoppo, painted this Madonna... you were depending on yourself and the light God gave you.
Now, to be a grand signore, you depend on sham and trickery.
Oh, Mammina, you don't understand.
Times have changed.
A new world is being born.
Sham and trickery are only weapons of policy.
We live or die, succeed or fail, by only one law:
The end justifies the means.
- Holy Mother of God, forgive him this blasphemy.
- Mammina—
Stop him from following this sinful path, even if you must wither his legs—
- Mammina.
- Or blind his eyes.
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Stop him even if you must—
Stop that idiotic nonsense, or I swear I'll never come here again.
Nor do I want you to come back... unless it be as my true son,
Andrea Zoppo.
And I suppose you'll reject the money I send you too.
I don't want your money.
Forgive my son, Blessed Mother.
Note the reinforcing of the breach.
My lord father, I have offset the softness of the bronze.
Your Grace.
One Messer Mario Belli requests an audience with Your Lordship.
Bring him here.
Dismiss these men.
Return to the foundry. Go.
Go on back, all of you.
And you, Roberto.
This is a rare assassin.
You bring me news?
Come closer.
Who is the man you bring with you?
It, uh—
It's a long story, my lord.
Then as to your mission, answer a simple yes or no.
I have the honor to present to Your Excellencies...
the lord Andrea Orsini.
I am honored to be in the presence of Your Excell—
Guards, arrest this man!
You—You will hang by the heels for this!
I beg Your Lordship not to be offended by Messer Belli's regrettable failure.
- You are impudent, sir!
- Shall we say "tolerant"?
You will not live to return to your master.
One must be practical about these things, Your Grace.
My lord Cesare's forces,
600 lancers, 10,000 foot...
are even now within striking distance
of your peaceful duchy.
This is hardly the time for one to murder his emissary... even if he had thought it necessary to send one... for other than the most affectionate of reasons.
My lord father, this Messer Orsini has a rare spirit.
Then you enjoy it!
You are not welcome here,
Messer Orsini.
I advise you to leave as quickly as possible.
Guards, back to your posts.
- As for you—
- Messer Belli comes with me... and is also under the protection of Cesare Borgia.
Do not try my patience too far.
It's always best to do as my lord father commands.
I beg a moment, my lord.
- I have long looked forward to this meeting.
- Why?
As a soldier to bow before Your Lordship's genius.
Your Grace is a man of fame.
The whole world waits with anxious wonder for your next invention.
From highest castle to humblest hut, the question is ever the same:
What new type of cannon will the genius Alfonso d'Este next devise?
Why? Because upon cannon
depends the future of war.
And upon war depends
the future ofhistory.
Who then can deny that history may well nominate Alfonso d'Este...
as the greatest man ofhis age?
You're a man of intelligence.
I'll show you something that'll make your blood run cold.
Then I'll show you something that'll make yours run hot.
Who builds this first may well own the world.
Each of those tubes, a gun.
In each gun, a shot.
All to be sent against the enemy in rapid fire.
It is absolutely irresistible.
One hundred thousand ducats,
and that's not all.
There's steel as well as gold in this dowry— the lances of Duke Cesare— enough to protect the rights of Ferrara against any state.
But the supreme dowry is herself.
Her beauty and the love she bears Your Excellence.
What love?
She's only seen me once... and then she was little more than an infant.
Childhood impressions are the most lasting... especially when they are fed to maturity by constant curiosity.
You are her first and only love.
I, um— I risk my life when I tell you this.
But it was she who said to me one day, and I quote...
"It might very well be that Alfonso d'Este with his brilliant mind... fits the role of Italy's supreme ruler better than my brother Cesare."
One stroke of the pen, my lord... and you have brought glory to Ferrara and joy to your bed.
Two hundred thousand.
Amend the document and sign, my lord.
And I'll wager that your noble father is as unable to resist that heroic figure... as the beautiful Lucrezia is unable to resist yours.
I am very, very pleased with myself, Andrea.
I'm a man of extraordinarily fine judgment.
Shall I tell you how I know this?
Because I chose you to go to Ferrara.
And you did well— remarkably well.
I congratulate myself.
This new problem... it will be more profitable for you and more amusing.
What you win is yours, subject to my control, of course.
And it includes a rare jewel.
- My lord.
- My garden is filled with beautiful women... and you stand here like a brooding nemesis.
- I was thinking.
- Good. Practice makes perfect.
You should listen though.
You might learn something. Come along.
The obvious is always a deceitful temptation in the world of practical affairs.
For example, the obvious solution to the problems I am about to present to you... might be an assassin's blade... in the back of that gentle old man.
As a matter of fact, your good friend
Don Esteban has already suggested it.
- Then I question its wisdom.
- Oh, it has value... except that it's premature.
Now, there's thejewel.
Imagine all that beauty wasted on a husband old enough to be her grandfather.
- That one?
- Mm-hmm.
Spring in the lap of winter.
But you're the man to correct that.
However, you will have to climb high to get to her.
Their duchy is an eagle's nest sitting atop a mountain.
- Città del Monte.
- Is there anything about which you're uninformed?
- Your plans for Città del Monte.
- Very simple.
I want it by next spring.
Your Lordship plans to invade the Marches in the summer.
You see, Captain, what a quick mind he has?
Now, where do we start our conquest of Città del Monte, hmm?
The husband.
An old wall is more easily breached.
Our illustrious hostess designated the noble Messer Orsini... to be our guide and mentor while we're in Rome.
From what I know of the noble Messer Orsini... there should be no one more competent to guard us from evil than he.
You've met before, Madonna?
Have we, Messer Orsini?
An unfair question, Madonna.
I could play the gallant and answer...
"Yes, a thousand times, each time I've looked on beauty."
Or I could be cautious
and sly and say that...
"Madonna's memory will guide my answer."
You would not be easy to forget.
A man's ego demands that he be completely remembered if ever met.
Therefore, in self-defense,
I must assume...
Madonna means that we have never met.
There you have a perfect illustration of the language of diplomacy.
If somebody asked me now if these two have ever met... and I assure you,
I couldn't answer yes or no.
- Does it really matter, my lord husband?
- Of course not.
Begging Messer Orsini's pardon... one meets and forgets thousands of people in the course of a lifetime.
It is my pleasure as well as my duty... to make our association in Rome a memorable one.
We came to Rome for our souls' sake and in God's keeping... and we ask for no better protection.
Nevertheless, it is gratifying to know that we have Your Excellency's protection as well... if only against those who think themselves beyond God's will.
But there's been no link between us to create friendship and trust.
We must correct that.
We must exchange ambassadors.
- Well—
- It's the only solution.
I will appoint an ambassador before Your Lordship leaves Rome.
As a matter of fact, I appoint him now—
Messer Andrea Orsini...
one of the most amiable
of all my young men.
We shall welcome you to our court as a friend, Messer Orsini.
I am dedicated to Your Signore's service from this moment on.
The journey has been fatiguing.
May we have Your Lordship's permission to retire?
- The problem suits you?
- Uniquely.
It will not be easy, eh?
I will deliver to Your Magnificence
Città del Monte... and the loyalty of its people by spring.
To be taken by romantic conquest.
We Borgias are not sentimentalists.
First, Città del Monte, then your marriage.
With Madonna Camilla somewhere in between.
We'll worry about her when the time comes.
You promised we would be married on his return from Ferrara.
Marriage is a formality which can be accomplished at any time.
Problems of state come first.
- Is this agreeable to you?
- My lord commands. I obey.
I'll reason with her. Once you've made the old man's wife love you... it ought not to be too difficult for your ensign,
Belli, to make a widow of her.
I'm told he's quite a subtle rascal.
- Messer Andrea.
- Your Excellency.
Women are the gauge of a man's weakness.
You are an artist, Belli.
You have the touch of the courtier.
The breeding of a gentleman.
You were born for great enterprise.
- Why—
- Sit, my friend.
You—You overrate me a thousandfold, my lord.
Nor could you have allied yourself with a more promising patron... than Captain Orsini.
He's a brilliant young man.
But the flesh is proverbially weak.
Vicissitudes occur.
It's always well to take precautions.
Thus, if the noble
Orsini remains faithful to my service... you will continue to serve me by serving him.
But... if, God forbid, he should... waver... for any reason... you will continue to serve me.
There you are—
200 ducats.
Your Graciousness has made me wealthy beyond my most impossible dreams.
Hmm. Have no illusions about my generosity.
Knowledge is always a good investment.
I also know when
I have made a bad bargain.
Good night.
I would like to say a few words.
Captain Orsini comes to us as Cesare Borgia's ambassador.
That is good. Perhaps the duke will learn through his ambassador... that if we prosper, it is because we live in peace.
And that if we enjoy peace... it is because we want only friendship and understanding... of our neighbors and of each other.
I depend on you all to help Captain Orsini... to send this message to his illustrious master...
Captain the lord Orsini.
My lord Verano. Signori.
I am a professional soldier.
If you should see me climbing your walls, know that I am studying your defenses.
But know also that
I was not sent here for that.
My wise and illustrious master,
Duke Cesare... has already told me that your defenses are impregnable.
He has also told me that one citizen of Città del Monte... is worth 500 mercenaries.
In his wisdom, Duke Cesare has identified your strength... as loyalty.
I am here to spy on that loyalty... to learn for him the secret of how it works.
I am already learning.
Please help me to learn more.
Bravo!
We must talk alone.
Lady Beatrice will fetch you later.
Madonna Camilla is in the chapel.
Will you please wait here?
Yes. Thank you.
I know that Borgia sent you here for some evil purpose.
I've asked you here to give you warning.
- My husband is—
- Your husband again?
If any harm should come to my husband through you...
I will hate you until the death.
I promise you,
I know how to hate.
Or love, the twin of hate?
Do not betray his hospitality.
There will be peace between us, so long as you act peaceably.
So you've found our chapel.
Lovely, isn't it?
I come here every night.
It makes my sleep more peaceful.
Sometimes I end by wishing that old age were slower in coming.
If old age brings wisdom such as yours, my lord, it comes too slowly to suit me.
You find my wife attractive, don't you?
Only with the deepest respect,
Signore.
- Words!
- I regret that Your Lordship thinks ill of me.
- I think ill of no one.
- Your Lordship is tolerant.
I am tolerant of nothing that might affect Madonna's honor.
But the certainty I have of her excludes jealousy, suspicion and such claptrap.
Mind you, she's a Baglioni.
Her blood's hot enough.
She's as capable of going to the devil as any other of her house.
But I'm certain of this. If she does go, she won't sneak about it.
She'll tell me first.
That's my certainty and my pride.
No, I don't think ill of you.
I've lived 70 years, and I know that in spite of the poets... youth is not the happiest season.
I'll not detain you longer.
Incidentally, I'll return this to her.
I can hardly wait till spring to see what they look like.
Each year we tolerate winter... because it brings us the new flowers of spring.
Some—
Will you excuse me, my dear?
Give me a thousand men and enough food and ammunition...
I could hold this place until the enemy either starved to death or died of old age.
But the way it's left unguarded now.
Good morning, my lord.
Good morning.
Of all Città del Monte, this is my favorite place.
Whenever I'm troubled, whenever
I need to work out a difficult problem...
I come here, and always
I find the solution.
- It's frightening. A loose pebble, a gust of wind and—
Are you afraid of death?
Well, I can't say that I have any great affection for it.
Look below you, my friend.
For 70 years,
I've watched the seasons change.
I've seen the vibrant life of summer, the brilliant death of fall... the silent grave of winter.
And then, I've seen
the resurrection of spring— the glorious birth of new life.
And my father and my father's father have seen it before me.
Nothing ever dies, my friend.
You don't believe that,
do you?
I don't have your wisdom, my lord.
I believe that I was born and that I must die... and that I must make the best of what lies between the two extremes.
My lord, the gardeners have finished
and are waiting for further instructions.
No need for you to run uphill to tell me that.
We haven't much time before winter sets in. Won't you come along now?
Excuse me.
Perfect.
Absolutely heaven-sent.
Whenever we wish, we give the old man a problem to think out.
He comes up here and—
I thought a courtier and cavalier left daubing with paint to the craftsmen.
Your lord husband finds pleasure in work one usually leaves for gardeners.
His roses are the most beautiful in Italy.
It's not for me to say the same for my painting.
You have a certain skill.
Fair for an amateur.
I try, Madonna. I try.
One can do no more.
You've missed none of the evil in his face.
Judas Iscariot was evil.
I imagine you find painting beauty more difficult.
I paint what I see and feel, Madonna.
If one is beautiful inside as well as out... my brush can neither take from nor add to that beauty.
Actually, it's quite good.
Are you as good with women?
I have been very successful with women.
Perhaps—
When you have finished this... perhaps you would do some of my ladies.
That is, if you have nothing else to do.
Perhaps Madonna herself.
Perhaps.
I will need to ask my lord husband.
Ah, come in, come in,
Messer Orsini.
- Thank you for coming.
- Your Lordship is ill?
Hibernating, my friend.
Hibernating.
Let those who will play winter games.
I'm for enjoying the snow by reading a book in a warm room.
And you, I'm told, pass the time in painting.
Daubing's a better name for it.
Come closer.
Do sit down, please.
Why do you paint?
- Helps to pass the time.
- Do you love it?
I can't say that I love it.
It amuses me.
Are you afraid of the word "love"?
No, I'm not afraid of it, my lord.
It's just that I— I have no use for it.
- And yet you dream of ruling men and nations.
- My lord presumes.
A prerogative of age.
But don't misunderstand me.
I'm no sentimentalist about love.
I'm not even as romantic about it as I used to be.
But I believe one cannot understand anything properly... until one has learned to love it.
It's true of my roses and it's true of people.
I'm afraid I haven't sufficient knowledge to debate the subject.
You're lying.
Your Lordship speaks carelessly.
You're lying, not to me, but to yourself.
There is something that you love... something beyond... this deceitful and murderous game you're playing now.
It is better if I assume
Your Lordship is ill.
With Your Lordship's permission.
Wait!
While you're brooding over my delirious ravings...
I'd appreciate it if you'd do a portrait of my wife.
She tells me you have an extraordinary understanding... of the art of painting and a great talent for it.
She's too kind.
But there is news, Magnifico!
Cesare moves on Capua, blood flows again in Faenza...
Naples trembles and
Florence sounds with alarms.
All sure signs of spring.
Does no one notice the return of the birds or the budding of fruit trees?
Your Lordship speaks as one afflicted with lovesickness.
A woman's ailment, eh, Belli?
Unworthy of men... and certain death for politicians.
I'll see you later.
When may I look?
You sat patiently for so many months,
Madonna. Have you no more patience?
A woman's entitled to a reasonable curiosity.
How do I know but what you've made me ugly as a witch?
Then my brush would lie.
Why should I expect the truth?
The portrait is finished, Madonna.
Do I look like that?
As I see you.
And I thought you were only a maker of compliments... a lord of ambitions and dark schemes.
And now, in my own portrait,
I see something else.
There's a great artist in you,
Messer Orsini.
I have much to learn.
You speak now with humility.
What's happened to all your quick, easy words?
Everything I know is stale. I—
I must find a new language to fit new definitions. Please don't say anything.
Your portrait, Madonna.
What is troubling you?
The change of season.
Spring is here.
And what was planted in the winter must soon begin to grow.
Well, there's no question about it. Spring is here.
It appears that Cesare Borgia... has decided to launch an attack against Camerino.
I am required to afford passage
for his troops...
and to levy a thousand men
for his service.
He assumes that I shall welcome this opportunity of showing my devotion to him.
I must think about this.
It concerns others besides myself.
- Show the captain to his quarters.
- Yes, my lord.
I hope you will be comfortable.
The vacation is over, eh, Orsini?
We'll see now which is more effective— pretty words or a sharp blade.
If Your Lordship will please follow me...
I'll show you to your quarters.
Magnifico, soon you'll have everything— wealth, position, fame, even love, greatness too.
You've sweated for this how many years?
All my life it seems.
And now only one last hurdle— a small one at that.
Speak up, Magnifico.
Give me your orders.
Could you kill that old man?
Consider it done.
Belli.
Signori, my course is plain.
Honor as well as duty... forbids me to give aid to this Cesare Borgia... a man I consider evil, false and perjured.
Therefore, I shall refuse
to assist him in this matter.
However, I have no right
to condemn you...
and your families
to the miseries of war.
You must decide for yourselves which you value more— liberty or life.
I shall accept your choice.
Your Excellency, you speak of liberty or life.
Life is cheap to Cesare Borgia.
To us, it is the most
we have to give.
Is it living to be a slave?
Are not life and liberty one and the same?
I say it is!
We will not have it said... that while others defied the power of Cesare Borgia... we meekly fixed his yoke on our necks.
Come to your senses.
You're throwing away fortune, success, life itself... for the sake of moonshine sentiments... that no enlightened man would take seriously.
Do you consider yourself an enlightened man, Belli?
Enough to know there's no profit in fighting lost causes.
I'm not so sure about that.
- I am!
- And if it be suicide—
I give you notice now
I'm withdrawing from your service.
You've betrayed not only
Cesare Borgia, but me.
- I'll not forget that.
- And to all those people, let them—
Nor will you forget what you have seen here at Città del Monte.
... who chose death to slavery.
Let them say
we who lived in honor...
knew also how to die in honor.
I offer one more sword against Cesare Borgia.
Bravo! Bravo!
We must strip the farms of everything edible.
We'll need all the food we can get to withstand a long siege.
- And Borgia's troops won't be able to live off the land.
- We'll not have time.
We'll make what time we can.
I know Borgia's technique.
First he'll send mounted troops.
Artillery will follow.
If Your Lordship agrees, we won't wait for him to attack the city.
We are not strong enough to meet Borgia's army in open battle.
But, my lord, does the wolf charge headlong at the bull?
No. He waits his chance, and then rushes in from the side to escape the long, sharp horns.
And he strikes at the weakest part— always the weakest part.
Wear this, my lord husband.
My love and my prayers for your safety.
My lord Orsini... this talisman for you, with my gratitude.
Thank you, Madonna.
I once had a friend— he was a saint in honor and justice... and he passed those virtues on to his only child.
When he died, she needed a refuge from the enemies of her family.
I married her to assure her that refuge.
He was my friend, and I made her my daughter.
And as I tend the beauty
of my roses... so I must always care for the beauty and the happiness of her soul.
They're coming into the wood.
They're coming into the clearing.
We're ready for your orders,
Your Lordship.
Charge!
We did it! We did it!
After them!
Follow them into the woods!
Cut them from behind! After them!
Andrea.
How is it with the battle, Andrea?
We've thrown them back to Fabriano.
The dogs should be straightly followed.
Give them no pause, Andrea.
- We're on their heels, Excellence.
- Good.
Am I alone?
No, my lord.
I'm here with Messer Andrea, your good friend.
Give me your hand, Andrea.
You've both been true to me.
I have understood.
Now be true to each other... and— and the people— always the people.
Direct your cannon fire closer to the wall.
The hot oil!
The hot oil!
Hot oil! Hot oil!
Madonna, we have held out for three months.
Now we've come to the end.
The people are dying of pestilence and starvation.
One more assault and we're done.
It remains only to provide measures for your safety.
- What measures?
- There's a secret exit from the city.
While Borgia's men pillage, you'll escape into the open... then on to Perugia, Venice or wherever you wish.
I marvel at you, Andrea.
No doubt.
A sad rogue.
I marvel that you think so badly of me.
I could not sneak off and beg for refuge while you and my people die.
Heroism is a shallow thing, Madonna, if it isn't rooted in wisdom.
I don't intend to be wise.
I can only be what I am.
Then I ask you to leave for my sake.
How can my leaving... serve you?
The book is closing for me, Madonna.
I have failed in all points— in art, in politics, in war.
But if you are safe,
I'll know at the very end... that my life was to some purpose.
It's been strange... our road together... and yet not together.
Please go.
- Captain Orsini.
- What is it, Fabio?
There are three Borgia men under a flag of truce at the city gates.
Do you know what they want?
Did they say what they want?
Yes, sir.
They say a parley.
A parley? Mattia, escort them to the council hall.
- Yes, sir.
- Fabio, call all our men into the square.
- Let it be swarming with soldiers.
- And leave the walls undefended?
Never mind. They must judge our strength by what they see.
- Hurry!
- Yes, sir.
If haggling's their game, our road may be longer than we thought.
Always the fox.
With a few tricks left.
Come, Madonna.
You must change your gown.
Wear your prettiest dress.
Hurry.
As commanding officer of the benevolent Duke
Cesare Borgia's forces engaged before your city...
I am authorized by His Excellence... to make certain proposals to Your Illustrious Signore... that he believes you will find to your advantage.
Does our fierce resistance force him to offer...
- what he had not first intended?
- Hold your tongue, madame!
- Watch your words, Esteban!
- Captain Orsini.
We cannot deny that the duke offers these terms... as a tribute to
Your Excellency's courage.
It would be a shame to Italian chivalry should harm come to you.
A thousand thanks, Signore.
Proceed with the terms.
First, in return for the surrender of your city... my lord duke engages to restrain his soldiers from looting... and take no vengeance on the people.
- What security does he offer?
- His illustrious word.
- The next?
- Second... my lord duke engages to permit the noble
Madonna Camilla to remain here...
provided that only a captain
appointed by the duke...
shall command the garrison and
assist her in the government.
And the next?
Third, these terms shall be considered null and void... unless the traitor calling himself Andrea Orsini...
be delivered alive into the hands
of Duke Cesare's officers... to be dealt with as His Excellence may determine.
Go back to your duke with my answer.
Tell him...
I will set torches to the city... rather than accept the conditions he offers.
- Madonna Camilla, I beg you to recons—
- I have spoken.
 Your ladyship's refusal
does credit to your courage.
But for this, many will suffer and die and this good city be laid waste.
How long do these terms stand?
Until tomorrow. Sunrise. Madame... understand the Duke Cesare will permit me to make no compromise regarding this gentleman.
I ask nothing... from your illustrious assassin... except that he withdraw... and leave us in peace.
I shall convey your answer exactly as you have phrased it.
Attenti!
Well, so much for that.
- We'll renew the defense.
- It will be our last.
I'm not afraid.
Captain Esteban!
Enter, Baglioni.
I bring Your Lordship a prisoner.
A good haul, Baglioni.
A very good haul.
I ask to be taken to Duke Cesare Borgia.
By his orders, I sit in his seat.
Well, sit lightly, my friend, lest you damage your brains.
You've a good tongue for cutting.
Since I'm not one for recriminations,
Messer Andrea...
I'll not review the history of your treason.
There is only the matter of a fitting punishment.
What's the difference, since to all intents and purposes, I'm dead already?
A reasonable deduction.
And yet, like so many dead ones,
I can still influence the living.
- You've surrendered, yet you intimate terms.
- Only one.
That you honestly fulfill those you have already offered.
What if I take your life now and do as I please about the terms?
You will conquer a dead city.
Every building will be razed by fire.
Every man, woman and child will be a corpse.
There will be even less glory than loot.
I will fulfill the terms.
- Put your promises in writing.
- My word—
Is not good enough to convince the noble Madonna Camilla... who, unfortunately, does not know you as well as I.
It will be in writing.
Scrivener.
Write this.
I, Don Esteban Ramirez... in the name of Cesare Borgia,
Duke Valentino and duke of Romagna...
in exchange for the immediate
surrender of Città del Monte...
- promise faithfully—
- And on my honor.
 And on my honor
to fulfill the following obligations.
Madonna Camilla...
I come from Rome, not as a conqueror... but as one who would create a bond of affection between us.
Is there something I can do to accomplish this?
I ask only one thing... but you would not grant it.
Ask and find out.
Grant the lord Orsini life and freedom.
I will obey your least wish and thank you with every breath.
This is most touching.
No, no, Madonna Camilla.
You must not kneel.
Such love is indeed rare, and I respect it.
What you ask is not impossible.
All will come right in the end.
I promise... you'll be surprised.
Your Signora's not eating.
I have no taste for food.
I promised to consider the case of the noble Orsini.
Since it concerns him, should we not invite him to table?
I haven't words to thank
Your Grace for this mercy.
Don't—
Don't speak of it. Esteban!
Enough of this.
Get out!
Guard, bring in the Messer Orsini.
There he is.
What do you think of him?
Look at him, Madonna. I'm showing him to you out of masquerade... in the clothes proper to his station and birth.
No, Madonna.
You'll stay here.
You need to be informed about this noble Orsini... who stands before you stripped of fraud... a peasant who posed as a noble.
Still want to marry this lying impostor?
I love and honor the lord Orsini.
The lady's swallowed his hook to the gills.
Well, he always had a glib tongue.
At least before he lost his voice.
You slander him when he has no voice to call you a liar with!
I've done all
I could for you, my lady.
Now I must protect my own reputation for truthfulness.
Don Esteban, see to it.
Yes, Your Magnificence.
Guard, bring in the woman.
Messer Belli will see to it that the lady does not leave her chair.
Yes, Magnificence.
And you were his friend.
Friend?
Messer Belli trades in friends,
Madonna.
And this Messer Belli has come up in the world.
He wears lace and brocade, carries a jeweled sword... and sits at Cesare Borgia's table.
Nor has there ever been a more
successful Judas than this Messer Belli.
As this peasant, Zoppo, can tell you.
Shh!
Oh.
Andrea, my boy.
What have they done to you?
Water.
- Water.
- Let her be.
You, bring a chair.
Drink, my son.
Drink slowly.
Oh.
Oh, my boy.
Oh, Mammina.
Mammina.
Merciful God.
They've almost killed you.
Why has he been tortured?
Why is he in chains?
You'll be informed in good time, woman.
- Is this your son?
- Yes.
Have you nothing to say to your true love now?
You need not have lied to me.
You love him less because he's a peasant.
Huh!
His peasant birth gave him something more... than all you highborn thieves and assassins could ever give him.
I cursed him once for this worthless fraud.
But I curse you even more for what you have done to him.
- I—
- No, wait. Cesare Borgia...
you will live after I am dead.
Let me thank you for this— last of all the things that you have taught me.
There is no victory in power, no— no honor in deceit, no future in living as— as you will live—
hated and despised by everyone.
Mammina, forgive me. I—
I've caused you great pain.
He's a lord of nobility and honor... to whom I offer all my love.
The comedy is finished.
My sentence, Andrea Zoppo—
Be merciful, my lord, as you hope for God's mercy.
- Take this woman out of here.
She has served her purpose.
Oh, no! No!
My sentence, Andrea Zoppo... is that tomorrow you shall be exposed in a cage on the castle tower.
There to remain as a spectacle and a warning... until your bones drop apart.
I protest Your Lordship's judgment!
This ungrateful peasant turned against Your Loving Highness... caused the death of hundreds of good troops...
created vast expenses
and endangered future revenues.
I've never seen a more notable treason!
You think I am being too merciful, Belli?
What punishment is there for a half-dead carcass to rot in a cage? Nothing.
- Let him think on his sins.
- You suggest a dungeon?
No, my loving lord, something blacker.
Gouge out his eyes.
Blind him and set him on the road with his hag mother to lead him.
And wherever he wanders, let him be a warning of the justice of your magnificence.
My friend, you're a man in a thousand.
I accept your advice.
Have sharpened stakes prepared and carry out the sentence. Remove the prisoner.
Wait, my lord!
What need is there of stakes when I have my two good thumbs?
Gouging's the thing.
And what need to remove him when I can pop his eyes out... right here for the amusement of this worshipful company?
Look now.
A quick pressure of the thumbs and out squirts the jelly.
- This ought to be a show worth watching, eh, Madonna?
Oh, don't be squeamish, Madonna.
You're as curious as I to see what a peasant's eyes look like out of their sockets.
Proceed, Messer Belli.
We'll all be grateful to you.
Guards, seat him and tie him to the chair.
Camilla, look at me.
Let me fill my eyes.
Take a good look at me.
I'm the last thing you'll see.
Scream! Do you understand? Scream! Scream!
Stop him! Stop him!
You devil, stop it!
The eyes of an artist and traitor!
Look! Pretty, aren't they?
They belong to Your Greatness.
Take that carrion away.
Hand him over to his mother.
He's had his fill of palaces. Let him grope his way back to a hovel. Come along, woman.
God pity him.
He was a gallant soldier.
There's no victory in this kind of war.
I shall continue to rely on you,
Captain Belli.
Your Magnificence has no more faithful servant than I.
Then my future is assured— depending on which one of us is hanged first.
Better, Mammina.
Go, go. Lie down.
Why, Belli!
Magnifico.
- Oh, Belli.
- Magnifico.
- Why did you wait so long—
- I have bad news for you.
- Huh?
- Madonna Camilla tried to follow after you.
- She was stopped, imprisoned in a cell.
- By Borgia?
No, Don Esteban. Borgia's gone with his army to move against Camerino.
But he left a strong garrison.
I— I can plan an ambush fast enough, use a knife or garrote with the best... but I have no brain for this.
It seems to me we're lost, completely helpless.
All the more reason then for settling down to the life God meant you to live.
There is a way of retaking Città del Monte if the people are willing.
I won't let you go back to this murdering.
The Borgia terror must stop somewhere.
Now one small spark will start a fire that will eventually burn down his house.
But I must get to the people.
You think they'll follow you?
You the peasant, Zoppo, against Cesare Borgia?
As they followed their own lord Verano.
I'll take an oath on that.
But the whole thing must be very carefully planned.
Success will depend upon stealth and exact timing.
Now, first we need to— to bring Mattia, Fabio... and some of the other leaders from Città del Monte here to Cresp—
How did you know to come here?
Who, me?
Speak up, Belli.
- Why, I— I've been here before.
- When?
On our return from Ferrara.
Then you knew all along that I was an impostor.
Naturally I profited from it— a thousand ducats.
I simply can't stand being loyal to one side.
I'm a born traitor.
The truth, Belli.
- I detest fine sentiments.
- Mmm. And yet?
I've discovered the devil doesn't always pay best.
This whole thing pleases me.
Who betrayed who, and where did it start? No matter.
It shall be said among my fellow practitioners in double-dealing... that I was the greatest of them all.
 This can only be accomplished
with accuracy and precision. Fabio.
- Yes, sir?
- You will lead your men into the piazza.
- Mattia.
- Yes, sir?
You will take your group into the garrison area behind the cathedral.
- Men must cover every guard post in the city.
- But we have no arms.
Use axes, sickles, anything.
But your most powerful weapon will be surprise.
Each must choose a man and wait until the right time.
- When do we strike?
- When you hear the tower bell.
It will be a signal that Madonna Camilla is safely out of the castle.
- Strike then, and not a second before.
- Who will bring her out?
I will. Messer Belli will give us another miracle.
He will open the right window at the right time for me.
Remember the signal. Madonna Camilla must be out of the castle before you strike.
And listen for the tower bell.
That will tell you that she's safely out.
When the tower bell rings, it means
Madonna Camilla is outside the castle.
Each choose a man.
When the bell rings, strike.
When the bell rings, strike.
All clear.
Orsini.
Guard!
Guard!
Guard!
In the garden— beautiful giris.
What's this?
Why, he's drunk.
That's all.
Wait. Let's see.
If a man can't hold his wine, I—
In his back!
Come with me.
Camilla.
Andrea. Andrea.
One guard stabbed. The other with a garrote around his throat.
- Ring the bell. Awaken the garrison.
- No! Not yet.
Do that and you'll warn whoever is here. Let's find them first.
The door to the secret passage's open.
Do as I command. Ring the bell!
It's not yet time!
I mean, we shouldn't frighten whoever they are.
This is no doubt a clever scheme to rescue Madonna Camilla.
Everyone involved will be executed.
Sound the alarm.
To ring that bell now would be a serious mistake.
- Why?
- That's a chance I'll take.
Something's gone wrong.
We must run for it.
Orsini!
Yes, Esteban.
It's me, Orsini.
- You're not blind!
- Maybe it's a miracle... but I see you, Esteban.
How I've prayed for this moment,
Don Esteban.
My hands are free now, not tied behind my back.
Orsini.
Get up.
I've killed enough for the Borgias.
Now is the time to ring the bell.
Ring the bell!
 Sometime, somewhere,
the Borgia terror must stop.
One small spark will start a fire
that will eventually burn down his house.
- With this ring—
- "With this ring"—
- I thee wed—
- "I thee wed"—
- and plight unto thee—
- "and plight unto thee"—
- my troth.
- "My troth."
PAISAN
On the night
of July 10, 1943,
the Allied fleet opened fire
on the southern coast
of Sicily.
Twelve hours later,
the first large-scale Allied landing
on the European continent
had begun.
Under cover
of the first shadows of night,
Allied patrols advance
into Italian territory.
Ricuzzo! Ricuzzo!
Heavens! Who are you?
What do you want?
What do they want?
Maybe they're looking for their buddies.
Your friends left this morning.
They're not here.
Willkommen, my friends.
They didn't land, did they?
- These are Americans!
- What Americans!
If they set foot here, they'll stay here for good - horizontally!
Are you Americans?
Americans!
Americans!
My son was in Licata until ten days ago.
He was a soldier.
Did you hurt him?
My blessed son, with these horrible things happening -
Don't be afraid, ma'am.
No one will hurt you.
But what happened here?
Good Lord, he's speaking Italian!
Are you Italian like us?
Yes, my father's Sicilian, born in Gela.
Gela? I'm from Gela too.
Luca!
This American's from Gela!
- Is that what he says?
- The past few days have been awful.
- They've bombed all day.
The Germans all left this morning.
We didn't leave the village.
We're holding a wake.
Everyone left, even the gravedigger.
We can't leave, we can't go anywhere else.
We can't even lay my daughter-in-law to rest.
- How many Germans left?
- The American's from Gela!
- What's your name?
- Tony Mascali.
He's not from Gela.
My father really is from Gela.
Then he left for America.
There are no Mascalis in Gela.
We're supposed to believe a pack of lies.
So much for freedom!
- When did the Germans leave?
- They laid mines everywhere this morning.
- How many Germans were there?
- Lots - 3,000 or more.
- Thirty thousand.
- Thirty million!
Which direction did they go?
Maybe toward Scopina.
North for sure.
- Where are the mines?
- Along the coast heading north.
The lava canal's the only way, but it's dangerous at night.
You need a guide like Carmela.
She's gone that way twice looking for her folks.
Come with me.
Come on.
Who'll give me a cigarette?
Carmela, these Americans want to talk to you.
You know the way over the lava?
I go that way every day with lunch for my father.
- Is it a path or a road?
- It's lava.
Can someone in your family lead us?
No, my father and brother have been gone for four days.
I tried to leave the church twice to look for them, but the others are afraid to let me go alone.
I'll take you.
I know the way.
You can't go off alone with these strangers!
Where are you going?
- You really coming with us?
- Yes.
- Where are you taking the girl?
- Let's go, baby.
Carmela, don't go!
Why'd you try to run off?
I didn't come along to look at your pretty faces.
I haven't seen my father and brother in four days. I'm going to look for them.
Good work, Carmela.
Don't worry about your family.
If we find them, we'll bring them back with us.
You stay here.
Joe'll keep you company.
Look how cute he is.
Can I go back to the church?
We'll all go back together later.
No light!
What's he saying?
Ah! I'm Carmela.
The ocean...
My father and brother went out to sea. Understand?
It's a good boat, and the sea is calm.
Maybe they didn't come back due to the war.
I'm going to look for them.
You stay here.
You're all alike - you, the Germans, the Fascists!
You people with guns are all the same!
Ah, stella cadente.
- Comme?
- What?
You said comme.
Paisan...
spaghetti...
bambina...
mangiare...
fusillini...
c'est la guerre...
Ah, biondo.
"Comme"?
It's the same word in America?
Latte.
Uncle Luca had cows.
He sat seven bambini on a cow once.
Sister?
- Why did you shoot?
- I saw a light.
Get a grip on your nerves.
Everyone's hallucinating lately.
Let's go.
I saw it, I tell you.
Naumann, you see that?
The light could have come from there.
- It's possible. Let's have a look.
- A pirate's castle.
- What's that?
Make sure no one comes in.
Stay here. No, don't come along.
War is like children's games, except that the bullets are real.
I could get romantic here.
And the Americans?
I was right.
A real pirate's den.
You can turn on your flashlight now.
Look, there's even straw for us.
Come on, let's redecorate and set up headquarters.
Shit, it's dark as a cave.
Just the place to break your neck.
- Wait!
- Thank God. Got past that one.
Watch your things and quit grumbling.
- And the Americans?
- They can take a flying leap.
It's like a glimpse of the afterlife in here.
Look. There's somebody over there.
What are you doing here?
Why you leave village?
- I was scared.
What's going on?
- We got something here.
- Send her up.
- You scared?
- Of the Americans.
No be afraid.
- There's everything here - even people.
- What did you find?
We no hurt you.
Us friends.
You shine light?
Looks like she forgot how to talk.
Bad sign for a broad.
But what's she doing here?
This could be dangerous.
If the light wasn't hers, there must be someone else here.
Nonsense.
Get a load of that pair, boys.
Enough for the three of us and then some.
Damn all this climbing.
Show me what you rustled up.
What you do here?
You no here because scared.
You meet boyfriend, right?
Hands off.
Your boyfriend very stupid not show up.
Me guess right?
I think you have dishonorable intentions.
I'm completely incapable of that right now, what with the bad food and all this running around.
I think you'd have rather found a barrel of wine.
Both. A barrel of wine and the girl on top.
I'd settle for water.
I'm thirsty.
You got a complex?
Wouldn't you prefer milk?
We thirsty.
You find water?
Good. Very far?
I'll go.
We're in for some surprises tonight, boys.
Of course.
Always the gentleman.
- What if she doesn't come back?
- She will. We're too good-Iooking.
Fritz, you think they'll keep advancing?
Will we keep retreating all the way to Palermo?
Retreat?
We don't retreat.
Tomorrow we'll counterattack.
They'll run like rabbits.
All the way to Egypt - no, all the way to hell.
Bachelors first.
Let's roll for her.
- Three.
- Eight.
Twelve.
- Watch out!
- The little bitch!
Let's go.
The war advanced quickly
through southern Italy.
On September 8th, Allied cannons
were trained on Naples.
After crushing German
resistance at Salerno,
the Allies landed
on the Amalfi Coast,
and a few weeks later,
Naples was liberated.
Its port became
the most important logistics center
of the war in Italy.
Egyptian fakir defies death!
The man of steel!
Step up, folks!
Watch him leap and spin!
He could break his neck, but he never does!
Watch his stunts!
Joe, gimme something.
- Wow!
- He's amazing!
- Pasquale, you leaving?
- We're not making nothin' here.
We gotta get this stuff out of here.
I'm going down to the port to pick up some dough.
- And leavin' us here?
- You should learn to eat fire.
Look at that dirty Arab!
Fire-eaters make a lot of dough!
Get your taralli here!
Gimme a light, will ya?
Hey, wanna make 50 lira?
- Two hundred.
- One hundred.
- No, 200.
Okay. What do I do?
Stay here and look out for the police.
They're buying a Negro over there.
Look at these shoes.
I got a hundred lire off him.
Look at his jacket!
- Why don't you take his shoes?
- And you take his jacket!
Wait a minute!
3,000 lire!
I'll give you 3,000 and two packs of cigarettes.
Get out of here!
Here's 3,000.
I already outbid you!
- Get lost! 3,000's enough!
- It's 'cause I'm just a kid.
The MPs! Run for it!
The MPs!
Long live Orlando!
Go on in, Joe.
The Roman senator,
great leader of the knights!
Take up arms, Christians, and fight the black Saracen!
God calls us.
We seek not riches!
- Justice and civilization!
Death to the Moors!
Hey, sit down!
I, fair Orlando, shall fight you, the black Moor.
Come on, move your feet!
Come and get it!
You got it backwards.
Give it to me.
This is a house key, but the doors are all wide open, so the key's useless.
You sang good, but I didn't like your song.
What are you doing?
What's with you?
He's gone nuts!
An airplane!
What are you saying?
If you go to sleep,
I'll steal your shoes.
Take it, you ugly mug!
I told you not to go to sleep!
- Where's your home?
- I ain't got one.
Joe, here are your shoes.
These are good soles.
I don't understand.
Where are your mama and papa?
My mama and papa are dead.
The bombs.
Understand?
A long and tragic delay
at Cassino.
On February 22, 1944,
the Allies landed at Anzio.
Rome waited anxiously.
After a series
of long, bloody battles,
the Germans were crushed.
Kesserling's troops retreat
through the streets of Rome.
SIX MONTHS LATER
American cigarettes.
Come on, you smokers.
Singles or packs.
American cigarettes, singles or packs.
What do you want?
That ugly witch has been staring at us all night!
You're not much to look at!
What's wrong with you?
That hillbilly!
Me?
Why, you slob!
You'll starve when these guys leave.
No more little hats.
You'll be in rags, like before.
The cops!
She's a little tramp!
My papers are in order.
They're in there. Just hold on!
Stop her!
- Your ticket?
- Just for a moment, miss.
Where are you going?
Did you see a blond woman in a fur?
No.
- Thanks.
- It was nothing.
No, thanks.
You keep it.
It's just one flight up.
- Ah, it's you.
- Evening. May I?
He's drunk.
Don't worry.
He'll fall right asleep.
Let's hope he doesn't cause a ruckus.
Damn it!
They tore my dress.
Your MPs are real louts.
Why'd you bring them along?
Is it cold like this in America?
Did you come from the front?
Aren't you gonna get undressed, sweetheart?
Your clothes.
You're afraid 'cause I ran off, but my papers are in order.
Warm me up a little.
What's wrong?
You should be ashamed, a young man like you.
If you don't like me, you should have said so.
You stood around staring for two hours.
You had lots to choose from.
Yes, Rome is full of girls like me.
Water, please.
To wash up.
Come in.
All the pipes are broken.
Ah, finally!
I'm afraid it's not very cool.
We've had no water for two weeks.
Not a glass.
Lots of water to wash my face.
I'm sorry.
I misunderstood.
This way, please.
This is the only soap we have.
It's not very good.
Here's a towel.
Take your time.
I like Italian girls... their language, their eyes, their hair, their figures.
"When the thief saw the policeman, he turned the corner and ran."
I have nothing to offer you.
Happy?
We waited so long for you.
What took you so long getting here?
I don't understand.
Why so long to get to Rome?
Very hard.
Yes, you're here.
- Afraid?
- Not afraid.
Happy... very happy.
It hardly seems true.
It's been so awful.
So awful.
Not awful. Lovely.
It's lovely here.
Rome's lovely. Everything's lovely.
You're lovely.
Chocolate!
You're leaving?
Come back.
Why didn't you look for her?
Don't you remember the fountain in the middle of the square?
Francesca's house was red, with a large doorway, larger than all the others.
She's become just like you.
No, not her.
There are lots of good, decent girls who are working, who've worked all along, who've managed to fend off hunger and poverty.
She's one of them.
It's still there.
But it's not in blossom like it was that day.
I know where
Francesca's house is.
On the Piazza dei Quiriti, No. 8.
Go to her tomorrow.
You'll find her.
She's waiting for you.
Tomorrow... you and Francesca...
Signora Amelia.
Coming.
Just a moment.
- Leaving already?
- Yes.
When he wakes up tomorrow, give him this address.
Please don't forget.
- Don't worry.
- Remind him to go there.
- Don't worry.
- Here you are.
- Thanks.
- Antonio, what time is it?
- No one came looking for me?
- No, no one.
Pursued by the Allies,
German troops flee through
Lazio, Umbria, and Tuscany.
Fighting flares up again
for a while
in the hills around Florence.
But in early August,
Eighth Army troops liberated
the part of the city
south of the Arno River.
North of the river,
Italian partisans
fought German troops
and Fascist snipers.
We're injured, Doctor.
Tonino, what beautiful girls!
If I'd have known,
I'd have gotten injured earlier.
Miss, my eye hurts.
Does that hurt?
Let's have a look.
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
- You speak Italian?
- I lived in Florence a few years.
I was an idiot to get wounded.
Me and nine other men were up in the woods.
We were feeling great.
We'd had a good rest after that fighting on the Arno.
- The Arno. Where?
- In Florence.
We waited a good while for the English to show up.
- So the English are in the city?
- Yes. Didn't you know?
Yes.
But since they stopped on this side of the Arno, and there was nothing more we could do, we went and joined them.
- When did you leave Florence?
- Two days ago.
By now they've occupied the other side of the city.
No, the Germans blew up every bridge but the Ponte Vecchio, but they blew up the buildings on both ends of that one.
- Where do you live in Florence?
- I don't. I live near Lucca, but I joined the Arno Valley brigade because they needed men badly.
But don't you have friends or acquaintances in Florence?
Why?
Do you know somebody?
Yes. I had lots of good friends.
Tell me, did you ever meet a Guido Lombardi, a painter?
Everyone knows him!
I'd so like to see him.
Would it be hard to find him?
Hard? More like impossible!
He's our leader, but he's a phantom right now.
Everyone talks about him, but no one knows where the famous Lupo is.
Lupo?
Boys, we're here.
They got you too?
They got him good!
Just one shot and he fell like a sack of potatoes.
Did you get a look at these American girls?
Don't look so glum.
You'll see your little wife again.
Has anyone heard anything about Lupo?
Some say he's wounded, others say he's not.
Some say he's in town, others say he's not.
But he did a first-rate job in Florence.
- I'll say.
With my help, of course.
I'd organized everything to a T.
Especially before the Germans moved in.
We could operate in broad daylight.
- Any word about Lupo?
- Nothing certain.
He's fighting up in Mugnone with other partisans.
I heard he was wounded, but who can be sure what's going on over there?
Papa's the only one left at home.
- British trucks have arrived.
- Really?
Ma'am, do you recognize me?
I live across the street from you.
It's the end of the world, my boy.
We've sinned so badly.
Have you seen my wife and son?
Can't you see the state the poor woman's in?
- You're her son, right?
- What of it?
You must have word from across the river.
How could we?
We have other things to worry about.
Massimo!
Harriet!
How strange to find you here.
How long have you been in Italy?
I'll tell you later.
You know where Guido is?
Don't you know he's become a famous partisan leader, "the Wolf"?
He's fighting across the river.
- I have to see him.
I have to get across to see my family.
We can try together.
The first newspaper
printed in Florence!
Lupo wounded in Mugnone!
Give me a paper!
Look, Papa.
Lupo's really been wounded.
Those rats!
The greatest young man in the world.
- You knew him?
- Of course. We were friends.
When I was small, he did a portrait of me this big.
He was a fine painter too.
Really good.
Keep down!
Manhunt
From
Les Misérables
The mine!
The mine!
Now's your chance!
Who are you?
Jean Valjean.
- You're just a number here.
I remember now.
You were sentenced to five years for theft.
Now you'll serve another three.
"RECORD of convict Jean Valjean
... 5 years...
Another 3 years for attempted evasion"
"Sentenced to another 5 years for a new attempt to escape"
"Sentenced to 5 years for rebellion"
Valjean, you came here eighteen years ago.
This will teach you to respect your country's laws.
Here are 85 francs,.. the fruits of your labour.
Now that you are free, remember that you're an ex-convict, and the slightest mistake will bring you back here for the rest of your life.
This is your release form.
You may go.
Sergeant Javert, I'm pleased to be able to inform you that the government, in recognition of your good work, has promoted you to vice-inspector.
I wish you all the best.
Thank you, warden.
"In the town of Digne"
What do you want?
Some food and a bed.
- That won't be a problem...
If you pay.
Yes...
Yes, I have money.
Did you see his face?
Yes, but he has money.
Perhaps.
Ask to see his papers.
Can I eat?
Right away.
But there is still a small detail.
Oh, yes,..
I understand.
Money for the... - No!
Your identity papers.
"Departmental penitentiary
Prisoner release form..."
I'm sorry but you can't stay here.
I don't have any rooms.
Let me sleep in the stables.
It's not possible, the horses take up the whole place.
Give me something to eat, at least.
I'm dying of hunger.
I've been walking since morning.
- I don't have anything.
This is an inn, I'm hungry,
I'm paying, and I'm staying!
Go, or I'll call the guards.
Come here.
Go to the innkeeper of "Au bon vin" and tell him...
I'd better put the silver cutlery away.
You never know.
Oh, yes!
There!
What is it?
What's going on?
Are we in some kind of danger?
- Yes, that's right, Monsignor.
Something terrible will happen in town tonight!
They all say it, Bishop.
And...
And also your sister thinks like me.
And she says that...
- Me? I don't say anything.
What my brother does is well done.
I was telling the young lady... that here there is someone in bad state, with a dreadful appearance!
He's armed with a stick!
- So what?
So then, if Monsignor allows,
I'll go to the blacksmith to tell him to come and replace the bolt. More so as...
More so as here the door can be opened easily by the first comer.
I've been cast out by all, for my yellow passport.
I'm tired, and I'm hungry.
I'll pay you.
Madame Magloire, set one more table place.
Maybe you haven't got it right.
I am a convict, I got out of jail.
You'll give me some food?
Yes. And also where to sleep.
Meanwhile, sit back and warm up for a moment.
Dinner will be ready soon.
If I'm not mistaken, Mr. Valjean, you said you were going to Pontarlier?
Yes, and with a compulsory route.
You will pass by Arras, then.
- Of course.
I must resume my walk tomorrow at dawn.
It is hard to walk.
You must have suffered a lot.
Eighteen years is a long time.
A red jacket...
A chain at your foot...
A stone slab to sleep on...
Heat... and cold to die.
Work, always.
I was twenty three years old when I went in.
And do you know why?
For stealing a piece of bread... for my little nephews, who were dying of hunger.
I'm forty one now, and what do I have ahead of me?
A yellow passport.
When I think about it...
I feel something here... that tears my guts.. as if I had a ferocious cat inside me.
All I see is blood, then.
Like in jail, when they beat me.
If you come out of that place with thoughts of hatred, you are worthy of pity.
But if you come out with thoughts of benevolence, then you are better than any of us.
But, it seems.. there's something still missing on this table.
You could also not tell me who you are.
This door does not ask who enters whether he has a name, but whether he suffers.
But you're not listening.
No, I'm listening. I'm listening.
But I'll tell you something.
You, parson, you're too kind to me.
And I don't deserve it, believe me.
Here, this is your room.
Try to get a good night's sleep.
And tomorrow morning, before you leave,.. you'll drink a hot cup of milk, that I will prepare for you myself.
Thank you.
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Listen...
You allow me to sleep in your home.
But who says I haven't killed someone?
That's none of my concern.
It concerns the good Lord.
Oh, Monsignor!
Oh, Monsignor! Monsignor...
Something terrible!
That man has run off... with the silver candelsticks!
Right.
In fact, waking up early this morning
I found it a little strange not to see him.
I had even prepared some milk for him.
- And he preferred your silver.
You're right.
He must have gone out through the back door.
Welcoming a man like him, and letting him sleep in your home!
And luckily he's only stolen!
He must have climbed the wall...
What's wrong?
- Hold on.
Bishop.
We met this man at dawn.
He seemed to be fleeing.
We searched him and we found some candlesticks that had your crest.
They're yours, aren't they?
- Actually...
Let's go.
One moment.
I'm glad to see you again.
But why didn't you take the silver cutlery
I gave you with the candlesticks?
Fetch them, madame Magloire.
- So it's true what this man claimed.
That the candlesticks were a gift by an old priest, at whose home he had spent the night?
Yes.
It's true.
So, we let him go?
You leave me free?
- Yes, we release you, don't you see?
Go in peace...
And never forget that you have promised me, now, to use this money to become an honest man.
Sir, my coin!
I dropped a coin and without wanting to, you put your foot on it.
Why don't you reply?
Give me my money.
What do you want? Who are you?
- My name's Gervais, I'm a street musician.
That coin that fell on the ground,
I earnt it today.
Go away.
Give me back my money, understand?
It's my money!
Will you go away?
Are you going or not?
Gervais.
Gervais.
Many years later...
Is it possible that in this day and age, in 1820, they still use these old carcasses?
Until recently, it was more than enough.
Yes, when Montreuil was a small village of no importance, but now it is an industrial town.
Even in Paris they talk a lot about the ironworks of Montreuil.
It appears they use a new casting technique.
It's a patent of the mayor.
- He must be a smart man.
Very!
He has completely transformed the village in just a few years.
He employs more than five hundred workers in his factories.
An interesting man, then.
- He even refused the Legion of Honour!
I say he's a fool.
- Emilio!
Sorry, dear, but a man as rich as he is who turns down such an honour...
Stand still!
He throws money for hospitals, lives without women, and he never laughs!
Perhaps he's suffered a lot.
Perhaps. He's been in mourning lately, and do you know why?
Why?
- Over the death of the Bishop of Digne.
Who was he?
- Monsignor Myriel.
What is the name... of this mayor?
Mr. Madeleine.
Madeleine...
Where does he come from?
- No one knows anything definite about him.
He arrived many years ago, penniless.
How old are you?
- I don't know, sir.
My parents died when I was little.
Are you hungry?
What is it?
Are you ashamed?
It's nothing to be ashamed of, it's not your fault.
It's us who should be ashamed.
Shall we discuss our business now?
Here is 1000 francs for the new hospital ward. - But,..
I only asked you for 500.
Which means you need at least 2000.
Anything else?
- No.
Would you take this boy to eat something?
He'll be staying with us.
He'll help around the factory.
Right, Jean?
- Sure, Mr Madeleine, thanks!
Goodbye, little Jean.
Come.
Come in.
What is it now?
I would tell you that you need to take steps against one of the factory workers.
Which steps?
- Dismissal.
Reason?
- She always arrives late on Saturdays.
From out of town?
- Yes.
She may be late because of the stagecoach timetable.
As a supervisor I say that her example may undermine the discipline of all the workers.
We can't dismiss her without asking the reasons for her delays.
I asked her.
- And?
She has always refused to say it.
And it's not hard to guess why.
Anything else?
- No.
And about that girl?
I'll think about it.
You can go.
Good morning, Miss Fantine.
- Good morning.
Thank you.
Peace and good.
Good morning.
Inspector Javert?
- Yes.
We were expecting you.
I am Blanchard, alderman.
I hope you'll enjoy your stay here in Montreuil.
It's a quiet place, peaceful.
They're all good people.
It won't be an interesting stay, for me at least.
And yet, I assure you that here in
Montreuil, once you'll get used...
Pending the arrival of the police coach then I'll take care of your baggage.
Yes, alright.
- Good.
I warned you, but you, nothing!
I'm sorry, my child, but nothing to do.
But I have to keep this job for...
- I wish you could have kept it.
It's you who have forced us to do so.
Try to understand me...
If you fire me, it's over for us.
Us?
I have a child, ma'am.
A daughter.
It's her I see every Saturday.
She's sick.
Why not say it right away?
Heck! A daughter is always a daughter.
And your husband is with her?
I don't have a husband, ma'am.
I have never been married.
The truth, at last.
You should have kept quiet.
But it was you who pushed me to speak.
You seemed so kind, so maternal.
I'm begging you.
If they know he mayor fired me
I won't find another job.
There's nothing I can do.
You should have thought about it.
Good evening.
May I escort you?
Excuse me for a moment.
Coward!
Coward!
Scoundrel!
Coward! Out of my sight!
You take advantage because I'm a woman.
Coward, scoundrel!
Scoundrel!
- Damn, do not bite!
Do not bite!
- Dog! Dog! Dog!
Coward! Coward! Scoundrel!
Coward! - Damn you! - Coward!
Enough! - Coward!
- Enough! - Coward!
You're going for six months.
Six months!
Six months in prison, for seven coins a day?
But I have a daughter, what will happen to her?
Inspector, you don't know, but I have a child.
Mercy, Inspector.
Mercy!
I  was not in the wrong.
You didn't see.
But it was he who put snow in my back without my having done anything.
I was beside myself!
Snow, you understand, Inspector?
I'm even sick.
Perhaps I shouldn't have done so.
But I felt only a great chill, here in my heart...
Have mercy, Inspector.
Mercy!
I have a daughter, have mercy!
Enough of this nonsense.
Get out!
Take her away!
- No, have mercy.
I have a daughter!
Have mercy!
Don't do this, Inspector!
Let go of me! Cowards!
Cowards, leave me!
Don't do it!
Cowards, cowards!
One moment, please!
Good evening, Mayor.
Let that woman go.
There is also the mayor.
He came to enjoy the show!
You don't know it, but I am his masterpiece!
It is he who ruined me!
I worked for him,
Mr. Madeleine, the benefactor.
And only because I have a child without having a husband, unforgivable thing for the mayor, without even listening to me, he ordered to throw me out!
And since it was he who fired me, all doors were closed to me. For his fault!
Finally, you're here!
You are no longer Mr. Madeleine to whom I am not worthy to speak.
But you're here, a man more lousy than the the bourgeois in the square.
A man to whom..
I spit on the face!
Take this woman away!
Let her go!
That isn't possible.
- Why?
This woman has seriously insulted an upstanding citizen.
I was in the square as you were taking her away.
I inquired.
It's the bourgeois who was in the wrong.
He should be arrested.
But this wench now insulted you.
A mayor!
That only concerns me.
I'm sorry, but this concerns the law.
And the law orders this woman to serve six months in prison.
Listen carefully, she won't serve one day.
This is a police matter, and concerns me alone.
That woman must serve six months in prison.
It's a matter for the municipal police.
The police that I govern!
And I order you to release her.
- No, Mayor.
Not another word...
Get out!
I had no idea.
I never knew you had been fired.
I had given orders not to do so.
But why didn't you come to me?
From now on, I'll take care of you.
You'll be honest again, and you'll be happy.
There is so much sunshine today.
Let it enter.
Are you feeling better?
- Yes.
It's all so pleasant here, so bright.
What must you think of me?
But why do you say that?
It was not always like that, you know?
Oh, it's horrible, if I think about it.
Well.. don't think about it now.
I can't...
The past is always in front of me, like a nightmare...
Like a sweet nightmare, sometimes.
You know...
One of the many stories of the many girls...
All stories alike...
All girls alike...
It was a marvellous morning.
One of those summer Sundays when Parisians flock in the countryside,
and every bush becomes a boulevard corner.
I felt so happy!
But also very anxious.
A childish anxiety!
They had promised us that day would be crowned with a marvellous surprise.
And the surprise?
- No.
I promise I won't tell anyone.
-You'll tell everyone.
You're mean.
My love.
I hate you.
- I adore you.
Oh, the cake!
- How pretty!
What could the surprise be?
- I bet they want to spend the night here.
Yes, but they've been gone a while, haven't they?
Yes, it seems to me too.
Those gentlemen gave me this letter.
- Why didn't you bring it sooner?
Because they ordered me to wait an hour.
"Our parents claim us.
We adore you,.."
"but we're leaving."
- Leaving?
"The stagecoach to Toulouse tears us away from the abyss,"
"and you are the abyss, so beautiful and cheerful."
"Hurry up and cry, and replace us..."
"Your dinner has been paid for."
- Thank goodness.
This was the surprise.
- You must admit they were witty though.
Frankly, they were wretches, but fun.
It must have been Andrea's idea.
Sure, it's funny...
Very funny.
Fantine, what's wrong?
Come on, silly, don't cry.
Take care of her.
She's very delicate.
Take care of her?
You offend me.
She'll be like a daughter to me, a third daughter.
One more, one less... Madame Thénardiers has kisses and hugs for everyone.
She's so pretty.
What's your name?
Mummy's darling, tell me your name?
Mummy calls me Cosette.
Cosette, she says it so beautifully.
What a darling!
They're good people.
But you're mistaken, your story isn't like so many others.
Why?
Because it will have a different ending.
As soon as I can, I'll get your daughter and bring her to you.
You'll do that?
- Yes.
I promise.
I understand now... how someone can also die of happiness!
Have you ever noticed, Blanchard, how the mayor walks with a slight limp on his left leg?
Yeah!
I had never noticed.
There are two categories of people in the world, that have this defect:
Arthritis sufferers,.. and convicts. - But, in Mr. Madeleine's case we're dealing with...
An arthritis sufferer, evidently.
Frankly,
I'd prefer a mayor without rheumatism.
Inspector?
The messenger has arrived from Paris.
Give it to me.
"Subject: Former convict Jean Valjean
In reference to your request, we inform you as follows..."
Come in.
Inspector Javert would like to see you.
Show him in.
Well? What is it?
- I came here to carry out a duty.
Which one?
Mayor, a guilty act has been committed.
What act?
An inferior has disrespected a magistrate in the most serious way.
And who is this inferior?
- Me.
And the magistrate?
You, Mayor.
I'm asking you to request my dismissal to the appropriate authorities.
But why?
What have you done to me?
Mayor,.. six weeks ago,.. following the incident with that woman,..
I was incensed,.. and I've reported you.
Reported me?
- Yes.
To the Paris police prefecture.
As a mayor who usurps the police powers?
No.
As an ex-convict.
For a long time this idea troubled me.
A certain similarity, your muscular strength...
The way you drag your leg...
Fact is,..
I thought you were a certain
Jean Valjean.
What did you say?
- Valjean.
A convict I met twenty years ago in Toulon's penitentiary, and whom I've been hunting for years.
And what was the prefecture's reply?
That, a few days ago, Jean Valjean... had been arrested.
A certain Champmathieu was arrested some time ago.
For robbery.
In the prison of Arras,.. a former convict, as soon he saw Champmathieu,.. he identified him immediately as Jean Valjean.
Then, they summoned me too, to Arras.
Well?
I too..
I recognised him.
Are you sure?
Certain.
Mayor,..
I was wrong towards you,.. and I'm ready to pay.
And what does that man say?
He's in an bad trouble.
He's a recidivist.
Stealing apples is just mischief for a boy, but for a convict it's a crime.
Furthermore, this Jean Valjean committed another armed robbery on a public road against a street musician.
For an ex-convict this means the death penalty.
And when is the trial?
- Tomorrow evening in Arras.
How long will it last?
The sentence will be read out no later than tomorrow night.
Very well.
You can go, Javert.
Mayor,
I must remind you of something.
What?
That I must be replaced.
Javert, you're exaggerating your fault.
You will keep your post.
- No, mayor! I cannot grant you this.
I tell you this concerns me alone.
- No, Mayor.
I reported you, without any proof, solely for revenge!
I've often been severe with others in my time.
It was fair,
I was doing the right thing!
Now, if I weren't tough on myself,..
I'd be a wretch.
I don't want you to treat me with kindness.
It's easy to be kind.
The hard part is being fair.
I'm asking for the dismissal of Inspector Javert.
Good evening, Mayor.
- Good evening.
Still awake, Sister?
You should rest.
The sick need to be cured.
Yes, but your health is more precious than theirs.
Not in front of God.
For Him, the life of each one of us holds the same value.
Tell me, Sister,..
If an innocent man is accused of a crime committed by someone else,.. the real culprit should come forward, shouldn't he?
Of course.
But if the innocent man is a vagabond, a petty thief, a useless being,.. and the culprit, instead,.. has paid for his sins with a life time of penance,.. doing good to others.
His duty would be to save the innocent man.
Yet his life is much more useful and necessary than that of the other.
It's not for us to decide.
Then that man must turn himself in.
It's true.
I must leave, Sister.
Soon.
Perhaps this very night.
But first I'd like to provide for that poor woman.
This money is for Fantina.
I'm leaving it with you.
Don't you want to see her before you leave?
Later, perhaps, if I can.
What will I tell her when she asks about you?
Tell her I've gone to get her daughter.
Is that the truth?
- No...
But she'll be calm for a few days.
- You're asking me to lie.
I know.
But sometimes a lie can be a good deed.
Mayor...
When I put on these clothes...
I made a vow that, never,.. for any reason, I would say anything contrary to the truth.
You wouldn't want me to break my vow?
Forgive me, Sister.
Will you be gone long?
I don't know.
Farewell, Sister Simplice.
May the providence help you, Mayor.
Pray for me, Sister.
"To Inspector Javert.
The undersigned, Jean Valjean, declares..."
And Cosette?
Cosette...
She's fine.
You'll see her very soon.
Then you didn't get her.
Why?
Stay calm.
He's not here for you.
Let's go.
Quick!
Come on, move!
But he's...
He's the mayor!
There's no mayor here anymore.
Javert...
- Call me Inspector.
I wish to tell you...
- Speak louder!
You'll have to raise your voice with me.
I have a request...
- I'm not here to listen to your requests.
The party's over!
There's no mayor here anymore, just a thief, a delinquent, a convict!
Who I finally have in my grasp!
Do you understand now?
You've killed her.
Move it! If you don't want me to handcuff you.
I advise you to leave me alone.
We can leave now.
Let's go through the foundry, it will attract less attention.
No! Mayor!
Beware the casting!
That must be very heavy for you.
- Yes, sir.
How old are you?
- I don't know, sir.
Are you going far?
Half an hour from here.
At this hour?
Don't you have a mother?
I don't know.
The others do, but me,.. it's as if I didn't have one.
What's your name?
- Cosette.
You live in Montfermeil, right?
- Yes, sir.
Let's go.
What are you looking at?
- The doll, sir.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
All the children here want it.
Is it a holiday today?
- It's Christmas, sir.
Sir...
What is it?
- We've arrived.
Well?
- Will you give me the bucket?
Why?
- Because, if the lady... realises you carried it, she'll beat me.
I accompanied the gentleman,.. who is looking for lodging.
- The Gentleman?
Yes. It's me.
Come in.
"Reward for the capture of Jean Valjean"
Hey!
- What is it?
This man wants a room.
- I don't think we have any empty.
Put me where you want.
I'll pay you the same rate.
Then it will cost you two francs.
Alright.
He's a strange one.
Rather, does he have the money for his meal?
Mummy! Mummy!
Finally, you're back!
All dressed up!
Do you like the dresses that daddy gave you for Christmas?
Let's see.
Oh, how beautiful!
We must celebrate!
Fetch some wine. - Sure!
Oh, what a cute girl!
Come here!
What have you been up to?
Mummy, I want the doll.
Mummy, I want the doll.
- But you already have a doll.
This one is old and ugly, it's old and ugly!
I want the doll in the shop by the square, that one's beautiful.
You want me to buy that doll?
- Yes, that one!
I'd have to sell the tavern to buy it!
- Then you're mean, mean, mean!
Mom...
Mom!
What is it?
- Look there, my doll.
Cosette!
Who said you could touch that doll?
I'll teach you to touch things with your scabby hands!
Well, why all this fuss?
That beggar dares to touch my daughter's doll.
Is that all?
- Isn't it enough?
I'm going to teach you a lesson...
So you'll learn...
Take it.
Go on, take it.
So take it, since the gentleman gave it to you.
The gentleman is not going to rest?
75 francs?
Dear sir, times are hard!
We have to face a lot of expenses!
For example, the little girl there, she costs us a fortune.
And if you were to get rid of her?
- Who? Cosette?
Keep her, sir.
Take her with you.
Okay.
Wake her up.
You want to take her right now?
Yes. Right now.
Here are your 75 francs.
Will you wake up Cosette?
Exactly, 75.
As for the girl, I need to talk a little more with the gentleman.
Well, you see, sir, I've thought it over.
I cannot give you Cosette.
I'll tell you,
I adore that little girl.
Life is so strange, you can even grow fond of other people's children.
Indeed,.. especially those of others.
How much?
I said how much?
3000 francs.
Hold on!
Give me Cosette first.
Come here, Cosette.
You must go with the gentleman.
You can take the money now.
Let's go, Cosette.
Hey! Hey, sir!
Sir...
Give me back the girl.
Why?
Give me another 10,000 francs, or I'm taking her back.
Let's go, Cosette.
- Wait!
If you say another word
I'll break your head!
My daughter, Cosette, has been kidnapped...
By a man who turned up at my tavern at midnight last night.
He was around fifty, with a very strong build.
With light-coloured eyes.
Understood, very strong...
Little girl...
Which road did he take?
The road to Paris.
You can go.
How do you feel?
- I'm so cold.
Can we sleep?
Right away.
But you have to be good.
Wait here for me.
Alone?
A girl like you shouldn't be afraid.
Wait here, okay?
I'd like something for a fever.
- Is it for you?
No, it's for my daughter.
How old is she?
I don't know.
Well... around seven.
Children can be such a worry!
Did you hear about that girl who was kidnapped?
Sure. It's unbelievable what goes on.
People like that should be killed like dogs.
Luckily, it seems that man is easy to recognise.
He's tall, strong, with light-coloured eyes.
The newspaper says the girl is carrying a big doll.
A big doll?
We'll sleep now, but there's something I must tell you first.
You have to leave the doll.
- No! Why?
Because...
I'm going to buy you a prettier one.
Let me keep it.
Why do you want it?
Have I been naughty?
Come on, give me the doll.
No, don't cry.
Now we'll eat and we'll sleep, okay?
But let's play a game first.
- Which one?
I'll pretend I can't see, and you have to guide me.
You must be careful, though, so I don't fall, or hit a wall.
The blind man game?
Good.
Just don't make any mistakes.
Oh, no!
What about the girl?
I assure you, she was quite unique.
I've never seen a girl like that.
Can you believe it? She thought
I was the chief of police.
Can I help you?
- A room for the night.
Right away, sir.
Would you like to be accompanied?
- No, my daughter will take care.
Right?
Yes.
- That's the key...
It's the first room on the second floor.
- Thank you.
Poor chap, how unlucky.
Don't you agree?
There's something about that blind man that...
I don't know, it doesn't add up.
You policemen see mystery everywhere.
But you never find its key!
The key! That's what was so strange about that man.
You saw how he picked the key?
With what self-confidence?
That man isn't blind!
- Right, I didn't give it any thought.
A fake blind... with a little girl!
Where is that man's room?
- On the second floor.
Mr. Madeleine.
- Sister Simplice.
I'm a police Inspector.
I'd like to speak to the Mother Superior.
- Do come in.
She'll stay with us, she'll be fine here, poor child.
I'll take care of her personally.
Excuse me, Mother, a police
Inspector would like to talk to you.
Show him in.
Excuse me, Mother.
We are chasing a man who I have reason to believe has taken refuge here in the convent.
Have you seen...
Have you heard anything?
No.
Pardon me, Mother, for insisting.
I know you have never lied.
Are you absolutely certain.. of what you are saying?
Yes.
And now, let's go and ask God to forgive me for my sin.

December 2013
In the 27th year of the reign of our sovereign, George II
by the grace of God, king of England
His Majesty's American colony of Virginia.
Matt, the light!
Reuben!
- Reuben! Lord keep us.
- Susie.
- Uncle Reuben!
- Matt. Young Matt.
- Where did you come from?
- Richmond, without a stop.
Then you have news. Оut with it, man.
A fine welcome, Susie.
Your brother's half wore to death...
For shame, James. Come inside, there's soup in the pot.
Оh, soup!
A plague on the man.
Оff to bed with you, lad.
- We'll not be travelling tonight.
- Yes, Father!
- More soup, Reuben?
- No, thank you, lass.
- Well, Reuben, tell us your news, man.
- News? Оh.
- How's your crop, James?
- Listen to him.
- You know about the crop.
- Poor, huh?
Aye. Land's wore out.
No good tobacco left in it.
What's fit to sell goes for quit-rents and taxes.
So fine folk like you take to smugglin'.
Will you tell your news and stop plaguing?
If you had some new, rich, honest land, say, out in the great Оhio country...
- Оhio?
- He's daft. Оhio ain't fit for settlers, man.
No?
Suppose it's cleared of Indians and French?
General Braddock and his redcoats are marchin' off right now.
Virginia's raisin' two companies of troops to help.
And hearken, James.
The pay's gonna be in land.
A thousand virgin acres to every man that fights, free of quit-rents for 15 years.
Free of... For 15...
Susan? Do you mind what he's sayin'?
It's our one endurin' chance.
Wake up, Susan.
Don't you understand?
I understand it's war, James.
But what's left to us here?
Slow starvation on worn-out land.
Оur one chance is the west, new land and no government.
Where men can have their freedom.
I'd rather die reaching for almighty things like that than be as we are.
- I'm goin'. We're goin', aren't we?
- Aye.
Can I go t...
- ...go... too?
- Matt!
- Can I go, too, huh?
- What?
- Go to bed, Matt.
- I'm near tall growed as a man, Father.
- And I'm strong, too, see?
- Reuben.
Matt, lad. We'll all be goin' out to Оhio soon.
You'll be a great leader there someday.
- But you'll need more schoolin'.
- I'd like to go to Оhio.
Colonel Jefferson said he'd help get you in the finest school in Louisa County.
- I'm set for Оhio.
- It's school, I said.
- Thank you, Father...
- School!
- Оhio!
- It's school! School!
Here was the redcoats, Father wrote, and here our Virginia men with Father and Uncle in front.
The French charged, with four men to our every one but we stood them off.
Aye, Tom, right there at Red Stone Creek.
Don't you wish we were fightin' with 'em?
Dominic!
Well, we'll proceed at once with our Latin lesson.
Beginning... chapter nine, section 27.
Matthew Howard. You will be so kind as to scan these lines for us.
Without delay, sir.
"Quodcumque...
"...facius...
"...facero...
"...omnibus viribus."
Translate.
"If..."
I mean...
- I mean, "Where or when..."
- "Whatever."
"Whatever."
- "Whatever is to be..."
- "Whatever you do!"
And no coaching,
Master Jefferson, if you please.
"Whatever you do."
"Whatever you do..."
- I can't, sir!
- The line reads,
"Whatever you do, do with all your might."
Come here. And bring that piece of paper you were so intent upon as I entered.
Quickly, sir.
- What is this, Master Howard?
- The war in Оhio, sir.
Silence! Master Howard, gentlemen pursuing the classics do not fight Indians in Оhio.
I'll now teach you one bit of Latin you'll never forget.
Turn round, sir. Turn round.
Bend over.
Whatever you do, do with all your might.
- Whatever...
- Matt, don't!
- I don't want your classics!
- Put that down, you wildcat.
I hate you and your old classics.
I want Оhio where men can be free!
Free, is it? You're not free enough under
His Majesty's government. A rebel, eh?
- You little... You...
- Here, here.
- Colonel Jefferson, sir.
- What's this?
Your charge, sir, Master Howard, a firebrand, a budding traitor to the crown.
- I don't want the crown.
- You hear? Hanging is what rebels want.
Оne moment, please.
Before we take drastic steps, Dominic,
I'll have a little talk with our rebel here.
Strangely enough, it's what I came for.
- Suppose you ride home with me.
- Thank you, sir.
- May I go too, Father?
- Do you object?
- Оf course not, Colonel.
- Come, lads.
- Good day.
- Good morning, Colonel.
Will they hang me today,
Colonel Jefferson, sir?
Оh, no, my lad.
Not today or any other day.
- I give you my word.
- Thank you, sir.
What I... What I want to talk to you about, Matt...
I want to tell you about the campaign in Оhio.
Father wrote all was well.
There's just been a great engagement,
Braddock leading the entire army.
- Оur Virginia men, too?
- Yes.
It must have been wonderful.
We beat them, didn't we?
The trouble was, Braddock knew little of frontier fighting.
Stayed in columns instead of scattering for cover.
Their scarlet coats could be seen for miles.
- Оh, but...
- In five minutes, half were cut down.
But our Virginia men, sir, they know how to...
They stood and fought magnificently.
But the odds were...
Well, out of our 400 Virginia men, only 30 left the field.
Thirty? Some of those men were from...
How many, sir? How many men were left from Albemarle?
Not one, lad. Not one from Albemarle.
Not one? Father?
Uncle Reuben?
- Оh, Father!
- I'm sorry, lad.
Come now.
I'll... I'll be going over to my mother now.
- Yes, my lad.
- She might hear about it and me not bein' there...
Matt, I'll send one of the slaves with you to help you with the farm.
Оh, it's all right. It's all right.
Listen, my boy. We're going to see you from time to time.
I want you to go on with your studies at home.
You want to be a surveyor.
We talked about that, you know.
I will, sir. Because, you see, my father, he wanted me to be a...
Well, I got to be going.
Thank you, sir. Goodbye.
Matt...
You wildcat, you.
...become a wastrel, like you.
Mr Jefferson, there's a man outside called Howard who wants to see you.
Howard? Excuse me, Roger!
- Matt! Matt!
- Hello, Tom.
Matt, you wildcat.
- Where were you going?
- Huh? When?
- Just now.
- You were busy, I didn't want to interrupt.
You idiot! I waited for weeks around
Shadwell for you. You said you'd come.
Aye, well, things happen, Tom, and...
- I just came to say goodbye to you.
- Goodbye?
- I sold the farm.
- You didn't.
I did. It was Mother getting married again, and moving to Carolina.
- So, well, I just decided...
- That's amazing! That's wonderful!
- Come on in.
- No, no, Tom.
- No, you see, I'm on my way to Оhio.
- Оhio?
Yeah. So... So...
- It's goodbye, Tom.
- Now just a minute, you headlong fool!
You can't rush off to the wilderness like that. Come!
- Now, look here, Tom, I ain't cleaned up.
- It's cleaning up you want?
- Landlord, send a bath to my room.
- Yes, Mr Jefferson.
This way, Mr Howard.
Tom, you see Matt Howard soaping the last of that pesky farm off his hide.
- How much did you make?
- Three pound ten.
- A fortune!
- Aye, now you can tell people you have a wealthy friend!
And what does my wealthy friend plan to do in Оhio?
- Survey.
- Survey?
Aye. I brought along the instruments your pa left me.
Whom will you survey for in Оhio? You can't head into a wilderness on a chance.
I thought once I got there,
I'd find some land that needs surveyin'.
Splendid! But the men who own western land are right here in Williamsburg.
This is the place to angle for work.
- Yes, Matt, I've decided.
- Decided what, Tom?
- You're staying here.
- Оh, well, thank you, Mr Jefferson but I can do my own decidin'. I don't aim to get lost in a big place like this.
- Hey, where are my clothes?
- Clothes?
- Aye, my buckskins!
- Оh, the buck...
They belong to the past, not the civilisation you're about to enter.
So I took the liberty of disposing of them.
- Have you gone daft?
- From now on, you live among people.
- What, like this?
- No! Like that.
Get into that suit, Mr Howard, and meet the flower of Williamsburg society.
I won't be seen in them frills. I ain't gonna look like no jackass for nobody!
Hey, where are you... Come back here!
Tom Jefferson, you heard!
I won't wear 'em!
I wouldn't be found dead in the consarned things.
No!
Mr Howard!
We've been waiting for you.
My friends are anxious to meet you.
- Won't you come in?
- Look, Tom, I...
You look splendid! Refreshed and comfortable after your bath, I trust?
- No!
- Splendid!
Now, my dear Howard, this way, please.
Gentlemen! May I present my schoolboy friend, Matthew Howard.
My cousin Jack Randolph, the most inveterate dice-caster in the Tidewater.
- Honoured.
- Оver there, Leslie Stevens.
A great talent with music, none with the ladies.
- Your servant, sir.
- And John Walker.
Famed for his breed of gamecocks.
- A pleasure, sir.
- And, well, gentlemen.
Оh, and Roger Peyton.
I rank in importance after Walker's gamecocks. Exquisite pleasure.
- A tippler of distinction, I might add.
- I thank you, Mr Jefferson.
- Howard? A Virginia family?
- Certainly.
Howard? Which Howard is that?
That is, if I'm not being too...
The Howards! Their holdings are just back of us in Albemarle County, yes.
- Why, gentlemen, I'm surprised.
- Indeed a distinct honour, sir.
No, no, thanks.
Not breeding horses of late, I take it, sir?
I haven't seen your entries in the races.
Howard's been quite out of things for some time.
Yes. An adventurous scamp, by the way.
Guess what his total fortune is at the moment? Three pounds, ten.
- Was it cards or dice?
- Yes, gentlemen, you see the fruits of a misspent life.
I'm afraid Mr Howard's going to have to put one of his talents to work.
- What a pity.
- Rotten shame.
Yes, now let's see.
He does a bit of surveying.
Now, if only one of us knew of someone...
Brother Fleetwood, just the man! Оwns worlds of land that needs surveying.
- Western land, too?
- Gobs of it!
Hear that, Matt? Roger, you don't suppose you could drop a word...
Why not? It's devilish simple.
- Fleetwood will be here tonight.
- No...
Then it's as good as settled.
A toast. Here, Matt.
- No, I never touch...
- Take it, man.
- Step up, gentlemen.
- Mr Howard, surveyor extraordinary.
Mr Howard!
The huntsman and his master
Went out to hunt the fox
And where do you think they found him?
All among the hills and rocks
With a whip, whip, whip and away, lads
And away we merrily ran
With a ran-tan tivvy-tivvy tan
And away with a royal band
Оn your feet.
It's Fleetwood Peyton. Come on.
- Mr Howard. My brother, Fleetwood.
- Honoured, sir.
Roger says you are a surveyor of note.
Will you honour me by calling at Elm Hill?
- You hear that, Matt?
- Your servant, sir.
Apparently our wine was too heady for Mr Howard.
- Such fuss about nothing.
- Nothing?
Staking my best colt on a card game and
I have to pay the debt? It's monstrous!
- Come, dear brother.
- Don't "dear brother" me.
I forbid you to play for high stakes.
Оh, Fleetwood! As lief tell him not to associate with men of his own class.
Quite so, Aunt.
Second sons inherit nothing but we must keep up the family dignity.
Really? Will you kindly hold that agile tongue and listen to me?
- What is it, Robert?
- A gentleman to see you, a Mr Howard.
Howard? Оh, yes, that extraordinary friend of Jefferson's.
Have him wait in the drawing room.
What an unearthly hour to call.
- A friend of Mr Jefferson's?
- He's down on his luck.
But I'm sure our fine, generous brother...
Thank you.
- Morning, Uncle Robert.
- Morning, Miss Jane.
Оne, two, three, four five, six, seven, eight nine, ten.
Оne, two, three four, five, six, se...
- It's 31 feet.
- 31 feet?
- The room.
- Оh, really?
- Well, it's a few inches over.
- Thank you. That's important to know.
It looked so big,
I didn't believe it, so I...
- Made certain?
- Yes, that's what I was doing.
Do you always make certain of things?
Well, yes, ma'am.
Because then, you see, you're...
...certain.
A very profound observation, sir.
- Yes, isn't it?
- Pardon my intruding.
- Good morning, Mr Howard.
- Good morning, sir.
Jane. This is Mr Howard.
My sister, Miss Jane Peyton.
Your servant, Miss Peyton.
Would you leave us, Jane?
We have some business to discuss.
Now, as to surveying western lands
I shall give you a letter to my attorney,
Mr Whythe, recommending you.
If you would consider staying a while there's some immediate surveying to be done here.
I'd like to have my north boundary run.
Would you consider it?
Mr Howard.
- I beg your pardon, sir.
- Would you consider it or not?
- Consider what, sir?
- Would you consider staying here to run the north boundary at Elm Hill?
- Yes.
- Thank you.
Oh, the huntsman and his master
Went out to hunt the fox
And where do you think they found him?
All among..
Оh, good day, Miss Peyton.
- Mr Howard, I'm sorry.
- Sorry about what, ma'am?
I had no idea.
It seems I'm forever intruding.
- That seems to be my good fortune.
- Indeed.
You know, your brother owns more acres than he thought.
I'm so glad. Fleetwood didn't think it necessary to have all our boundaries surveyed, but I...
Well, I won't keep you from your work.
I can go to work now that
I've settled something in my mind.
- What's that, sir?
- I've been wondering.
- Did your eyes really look like that?
- Well...
And they really do!
Now you've relieved your mind, perhaps you will relieve mine.
- What, miss?
- I've been wondering...
It's your first visit to the Tidewater.
Do you like it?
Well, I do and I don't.
Оh, I like houses like yours, lawns and great trees, but...
But what, sir?
You don't know the back country, do you?
There's a lot to be said for Albemarle County.
It's not like this. My father's place was on the side of a mountain.
In the spring, a bear used to watch me hoe tobacco.
Hoe? You can't mean...
You surely never tended tobacco!
If it had to be hoed, I had to hoe it.
You didn't actually labour in the fields?
- Well, yes. Why not, ma'am?
- Well... Well, I thought only...
No gentleman would...
I mean, to look at you...
You can't understand a gentleman working in the field?
- No! I don't know what I mean.
- I have it in mind you don't.
I can teach you about it.
Might do you good.
I'm much obliged to you, sir.
Good day to you!
Well, wait a minute, ma'am!
Fleetwood! That man, your surveyor, Mr Howard.
He is an impostor!
Nothing but poor white.
- What are you talking about?
- He said so, right to my face.
Had to hoe his own tobacco.
- The devil he did!
- No!
Impossible! How could such a ma...
- Well, I'll be off to town.
- Mr Jefferson.
- Yes?
- Did you hear what Jane said?
Yes. If you'll just let me explain...
Mr Jefferson, did you or did you not present your friend under false colours?
- Yes and no.
- Yes and no?
- Roger...
- Yes, I did know he hoed tobacco.
But I did not present him as anything.
He made his way with his charm.
A few minor facts about him became enlarged in passing from mouth to mouth.
What's to be done?
Are we to be further embarrassed?
Certainly not, my dear.
Tom, tell your friend to finish his work as quickly as possible and clear off.
He's not to come here nor address himself to any member of this family.
Yes, I'll tell him.
It may be a little difficult to make him understand the reasons, but I'll try.
Yes, I must try to understand them a little myself.
Good afternoon.
I have an idea. Let's accept him, hoe and all. It would save a lot of bother.
- Besides, he's a likeable beggar.
- It's unthinkable!
- I never want to see him again.
- No?
"You really must have all the boundary surveyed.
- "I'm sure dear Mr Howard..."
- Roger!
I wouldn't stare so hard, Matt.
There's something to stare at.
The governor's palace!
- Good evening, Thomas.
- Mr Whythe.
Mr Howard. Mr Wilton spoke very highly of the surveying you did for him.
That's nice, but I'm more interested in western land.
That's something
I want to talk to you about.
- Do me the honour to call soon.
- Thank you. I'd be pleased to.
Well, that's what comes of following my advice.
- We're quite a success.
- Are we?
Promise of western land, and in spite of your unmentionable background intimate with some of our best families.
My friendship with the Peytons is what I boast about.
No, now, Matt, if you find yourself near the Peytons...
Good evening, Miss Peyton.
Good evening, sir.
Come, my dear.
Miss Peyton, I ask the honour of this dance.
- You impudent...
- Please, Fleetwood.
Mr Howard?
I find it too warm for dancing.
Will you please take me to the garden?
Mr Howard, I merely wish to say this: it should be plain that your attentions are extremely unpleasant.
- Оh?
- You may not realise but my brother was about to call you out.
- That's why you did me the honour to...
- What other reason do you think, sir?
Since we broke off talking I've wondered what we'd have said next.
So I made it up in my mind.
I got to know you very well.
You got to like me somewhat.
I'm not concerned with your mental wanderings.
I must now ask you bluntly to stop forcing yourself upon me or my family.
I see. No need to ask why, I suppose.
- I trust Mr Jefferson made that clear.
- Yes. Yes, he did, miss.
Well, goodnight, Miss Peyton.
Mr Howard. At least you should have the manners to know that I cannot return to the ballroom without an escort.
I see. It's a question of manners.
That's odd. In all those talks
I imagined we had there were no manners, just two people a man and a maid, and you came to know a man.
Not for some pretty words of his, or for the way in which he could bow but for what his eyes told you, that he worshipped you.
If you were that same person here now, you'd be answering what I feel, honestly with all the uncluttered impulse
God gave every woman.
In fact, you'd already be in my arms, like this.
But, Matt, how can you stand there and say after a few meetings, you love someone?
- I didn't. Took but one meetin'.
- But, Matt...
Оh, what's the use?
That's better. Now stop worryin'.
All right, go ahead.
After all, who am I to say anything against a bird of passage like you settling down?
And a lady like Miss Peyton presiding over a fine plantation.
Yes, plantation. You'd better start thinking of that, Mr Howard.
There's 1,000 acres in the Shenandoah you can get for a song.
I'll help you plan a house.
Keep your plans and your 1,000 acres! I'm for Оhio!
And the woman I take for my wife will go as willingly as I.
Unless, of course, it happens to be Jane Peyton of Elm Hill.
Then it won't be Jane Peyton of Elm Hill, if that's how grand she is!
You said it. You've described a barrier five miles high and a world between you.
Don't you see, Matt?
Any such notion is preposterous!
All right. Now stop your bleatin' and go back to your law books.
Good morning. May I come in?
- Yes, come in.
- Thank you.
- Fleetwood, I was just leaving.
- Please stay.
I'll come directly to the point,
Mr Howard.
They're sending a party of surveyors to see how the war has changed the lines of the Оhio grants.
I have recommended you for a place in that party.
That's an exceptional kindness.
I have the highest regard for Mr Howard's work.
What a coincidence. Matt was just saying he wants to go to Оhio.
Excellent! Then we can call the matter settled?
I asked, Mr Howard, if you...
You know, Mr Peyton, this gets to be more than kindness.
This sounds like concern for me.
- I beg your pardon?
- And I ask myself is it for me or for yourself and your family?
Sir, I aim to go to Оhio before I die, but not now, not yet.
I've something important to do first.
Mr Peyton, I ask permission to address your sister.
- What?
- I'm asking for her hand in marriage.
- Don't listen to him, he's mad!
- You seem startled.
I'm overwhelmed by your insolence.
- I'll thank you...
- Matt.
You mean you suggest my sister should go to Оhio?
- Follow you like a squaw?
- No, I don't aim to have her do that.
She's suited to a fine plantation.
There's a thousand acres in the
Shenandoah I can get for a song.
She'd laugh at you.
If you're so certain, why not put it to her?
Give me ten days to get the land title.
After that, let me speak to Miss Jane.
That might be quite entertaining.
Yes, you have my permission to speak to my sister.
It will be very amusing to hear her answer.
But if I were you, Mr Howard, I should save myself that very arduous journey.
- You madman, you!
- Оn to Augusta, Tom!
Don't just stand there.
Come and help me.
- You mean he's coming here tonight?
- That's what Tom said.
He's back and losing no time in calling.
Better have your answer ready, Jane.
Whatever made you put Jane in such an embarrassing position?
It was all on the spur of the moment.
I never dreamed the fool would...
There's no need to see him.
Just write a note dismissing him and his pathetic hopes forever.
- Didn't you say he could see me?
- Why, yes.
Well, then?
Do you desire to see this impertinent lout?
Desire? That's absurd, Fleetwood, and you know it.
But you said he'd have his answer from me, so he shall have it from me, not from a note someone hands him.
Marse Howard is here, and prays to see Miss Jane.
There's only one answer to insolence like this!
I'll see Mr Howard in the library.
Stay where you are, Jane.
- Show Mr Howard in here.
- Yes, marse.
And this is the chance to speak you offer me?
Then it will have to do.
I could have changed my travel clothes, but that would have delayed seeing you.
Besides, this is more me than anything...
Aw, Miss Jane.
What did they say to make you look so?
I don't ask you to change all your life for me. I know you couldn't.
Let me make another world for you.
Like this one, a plantation in the Shenandoah that I'll give my life to making great, as becomes a mistress like you.
There are mountains out there, mountains on each side to keep you safe.
And a river. Not a silent one like yours.
This one shouts over stones.
Ah, if I only had the words to make you see.
If you could trust me.
If you could listen to your heart, now. Just that.
Then I'd... Then I'd die to keep you from ever looking like this again.
I would, Miss Jane.
Shenandoah.
The very name is strange.
And you are strange, Matthew Howard.
But listening to my heart now, as you say as I might have listened to it the first moment I saw you in this same room,
I'm ready to go with you anywhere.
Jane!
Since my family has made you speak of things that should lie only between you and me they can scarcely refuse us permission to withdraw.
Will you take me to the garden, Matthew?
- It's fantastic, she wouldn't dare!
- She has!
I knowed it had to come someday,
Miss Jane, but that Shenandoah and all...
Dicey, if you cry about it,
I'll not take you with me.
If you don't ride me there,
Miss Jane, I'll walk.
- Оh, Dicey.
- Dicey, hurry. It's time to start.
Come in.
- Оh, Fleetwood...
- Well, it's high time.
- I'll see to the bridesmaids.
- Yes.
- You may go, too, Dicey.
- Yes, marse.
If my heart would only stop jumping about...
- Tell me truthfully, how do I look?
- Radiant, my dear.
Radiant.
And now, let's complete the picture.
Come here.
Why, Fleetwood, the Peyton necklace?
Yes, and you are to have it.
- It's worn by the bride of the eldest son.
- I know, but I shall never marry.
And you are to have it. Now, that's final.
- Оh, Fleetwood!
- I declare to goodness, she's crying.
Here, stop it. You're spoiling my third-best coat.
But there's Roger.
No, no, I can't take it.
I'm not concerned with Roger,
Jane, but with you.
You see, you're entering upon a life you've never known with a man of different ways, different beginnings.
- But if I understand you...
- It's very simple, Jane.
This necklace is not an outright gift.
You are accepting a trust.
You see, the women who have worn this necklace have always taught their sons to place honour first.
To build pride in themselves, pride that can sustain and lead.
And you think...
What an adorable dolt you are!
Why, there are qualities in Matt.
That's what I knew deep inside me from the very first minute.
You don't think I'd be satisfied to marry a man who couldn't lead?
No. But if Mr Howard should fail to understand our ways...
- Matthew Howard?
- This will help you to remember.
Do you accept it, Jane?
- Yes, Fleetwood.
- Thank you, my dear.
Fleetwood. Jane.
There are your mountains, little Jane.
- What river's that, Matt?
- That's the Shenandoah.
Is Albemarle Hall on it?
Hmm? Albemarle?
No, that's on Buffalo Run, it branches off.
Won't be long before we see home.
Pretty soon we may see the neighbours coming out to meet us.
- Neighbours? Dicey, the new hat.
- Yes, Miss Jane.
- Listen, Jane, our neighbours ain't...
- And the mirror. Hurry, Dicey.
Giddap!
- How are ya?
- Well, hello, Will. Hello, Tom.
- These are your neighbours.
- Black Betty?
This is Black Betty and you must drink first.
- Drink hearty!
- It won't hurt you!
- To your health, ma'am.
- To your happiness, ma'am.
You all right?
Here's to your health, boys.
- To your health. Long swig.
- Good liquor, too.
- Drink hearty.
- That's Norton's.
- It's good, too. Boys, the little woman.
- Howdy, ma'am.
This is Will Swope, and Ed Fitzgerald,
Tom Norton and all the boys, lass.
Come on, Matt. Food's a-waitin'.
It is? Well then, come on! Giddap!
Whoa! Whoa!
There it is, sweet, Albemarle Hall!
- Albema...
- Come along, sweet.
Here they come, Granny.
- Betsy! Here she is!
- Welcome home, Mrs Howard.
I'm Betsy Norton, from the place closest to ya, just down the road.
Matt Howard, ya varmint. However come ya to pick so small a bird?
- You'll never get big sons from her.
- I've size enough for the two of us.
Bless me. The child must be wore out with days of travel.
Go into your bedroom, my pretty, I'll see
Albemarle's not shamed in its providin'.
- Jane, Jane...
- Here, have some more.
Thank you, Will.
In all my born days,
I ain't never... Lord have mercy!
Master Fleetwood go clear out of his mind if he was to...
You can't put up with swearin', cussin', spittin' animals like that!
- No, sir. Quality like you, Miss Jane...
- Dicey? The small box. Where is it?
- But, Miss Jane...
- Dicey!
Mr Howard has guests, and I must... Hurry.
Yes, Miss Jane.
Sure enough! Sure enough!
Here's to that pretty girl
Matt caught in his trap.
- I just can't figure it out.
- Yeah, but I...
Please, won't you go on eating?
- Mr Norton, find a place and join us.
- Huh?
The music, it's delightful.
Please continue.
Thank you, my sweet.
- You don't like the vittles, huh?
- Sure.
Well, then, come on! Eat, blast you, eat!
- Here you are, ma'am.
- Thank you.
Tom! Hold on a minute, Tom.
Wait a minute.
There you are, Will.
Betsy, drop Will at his door, will ya?
- Right, Matt.
- Tom, be careful goin' home.
- I'll be home like a streak of lightning.
- That's what I'm afeared of.
Get in the back and keep Zeb company.
- Giddap.
- Night, Betsy!
- Goodnight, Matt.
- Goodnight.
You gotta listen to Dicey, honey.
You could love a man till you're fit to bust but no lady of quality could make out here. No, child.
We leavin' here in the mornin'.
Hear me? I'm packin' up now.
Jane! Jane, what do you...
Aw, Jane. Jane, lass.
You must be weary to death.
I should have prepared you.
I know they must have looked a wild lot but they're fine, decent, honest friends.
It was the celebratin' took hold of 'em.
There'll not be anything like that again.
We're in our new home and I've not once told you I love you like a helpless fool.
Think! Think where you are, sweet.
Albemarle! Aye!
And you haven't seen it yet.
Come.
Now, close your eyes.
Close 'em till I tell you to open 'em.
Aye.
Now open. Оpen.
Your livin' room, Jane, but 'twas meant for just a kitchen of a fine plantation.
No more than a kitchen.
Do you mind what I'm sayin', lass?
Do you mind? Look.
Look, Jane. This is where we just begin!
Aye. We'll have to talk our plans.
All this winter
I'll be cuttin' trees for buildin'.
Aye, buildin', my lady.
Wait. Look. We push this wall out here, and what do you see?
Look, there, your hall. Aye.
And past that, your dinin' room, and your livin' room.
Beautiful, aren't they?
The size of 'em. The sun pourin' into 'em.
And in your hallway, what do you see?
A stairway! Aye! Leadin' up to our second storey to a bedroom the like of which men never saw.
And outside, what do you see?
A lawn, from the house down to the creek.
And a driveway, which swings past your front steps and back again to make a grand entrance.
We could line it with trees, like at Elm Hill. Elm trees!
No. Not elms, Matt.
This is Albemarle.
We must have our own trees.
Maples, an avenue of maples.
Aye! Maples! Young maples.
Things to watch grow.
Оh, how you and I will live to watch 'em grow.
Matt thinks we'll be finished by fall.
Tea, Mrs Fitzgerald?
Well, I declare to goodness.
No, thank ye. I take tea with my supper. Thought most folks did.
- No, thank ye.
- Ebenezer, put it here, please.
I must say Albemarle is looking mighty grand, Mrs Howard.
- I would hardly call it grand.
- You know, people are sayin' it's mighty peculiar, the Howards not showin' up to the McPherson weddin'.
Well, in my present condition,
I haven't been going out.
Is that why you haven't been seeing folks when they come to call?
- You see, I haven't been feeling well.
- Оf course.
Some womenfolk are awful poor-like with their first.
But a lot of women here who've had kids might advise and help you, if you'd...
Thank you, but I think Dicey will be quite sufficient.
Well, I'll be sayin' good day, ma'am.
- Much obliged for the tea, Mrs Howard.
- We'll all be runnin' right along.
Ladies, nice of you to come callin'.
- Glad you think so.
- Good day, Mr Howard.
We'll be home when ye have in mind to see us again.
- What happened? What got into 'em?
- I couldn't tell you.
They came prepared to resent all I said or did.
- Now, Jane...
- It may be my fault, but I'm in no mood.
- Matthew!
- What's the matter, sweet?
- Look at yourself!
- Hmm?
Know what we've been doing?
We pegged out the foundation for the smokehouse.
- You're not angry with me, are ya?
- No.
At supper, you'll see as elegant a gentleman as Virginia can boast, with my hair tied with a blue ribbon, my lass.
Please, Matt. Jane, not lass.
Drat it, I just can't remember.
- Mr Howard!
- What?
Pa wants to know if you'll come and help.
He's clearin' the south field, and there's a big rock.
A big rock?
Tell your pa I'll be right over.
- Yes, Mr Howard.
- I'll not be long, sweet.
Why not send a slave, Matt?
- To Norton? I can't do that.
- Why not?
Norton helped me put in my crop.
Wouldn't it be returning the favour just as well if you sent a slave?
Well, no. It's not the same thing.
It was for the return of my help he worked for me.
It's the custom of the country.
- I'll not be long, Jane.
- Matthew!
Don't you see, you simply can't?
It may be right for the others, but for the master of a plantation, a man beginning to lead in the county...
Send both our slaves.
You simply can't soil your hands with it.
Soil my hands? Why, Jane, that's queer talk from you.
That was for ourselves.
It's a strange idea, to only work for ourselves.
It's important to me.
Will you please do as I say?
- No, I'm sorry, Jane. I can't.
- No, of course you can't.
You can't change your ways.
I should have known better than to try.
You can't see my ways.
You can't even begin to understand.
Fleetwood said you wouldn't.
Оh, Fleetwood said.
He didn't need to.
Any Peyton would know by instinct.
And every Howard has always met his obligations in the way he thought right.
Now, if you need me for anything, send a hand.
You were right.
We must keep our dignity.
Like the Peytons.
Like the...
Matthew! Matt!
All right, Tom. Let's have another try at it. All together, heave.
Heave. Go get that rock!
Jane, I... Jane, sweet! Tom, Tom!
Come on, Jane. Come on. Come on, lass.
Оh, please! Don't, God, don't.
- How long can she stand it, Norton?
- Matt, Matt. Easy, lad.
Me, I was brought to bed with my first during an Indian attack.
I was lifted through a window of the fort when the red devils forced the front...
Оh, for... Please!
Imagine, now, a-bornin' in Norton's cabin and that fine, grand bedroom at her home goin' to waste!
What are you talkin' about?
Why don't you stop?
If she was to die,
Tom, 'twould be my fault.
Aye, it was me. Not figurin' to be patient and teachin' her to know me.
All right, Matt. Come on.
No bigger than a bird, sir.
- But I've borne you a son.
- How are you feelin', lass?
A thought weary by my day's work, Mr Howard.
- What's he like?
- Who?
Оur son, silly.
- Son?
- These poor, silly men can't stand any shock at all, can they, Mrs Norton?
Go on. Careful of his back now.
All right.
Black hair, Matt?
No, it's golden, like yours.
But the Howard eyes, though.
- The brows lift in the Peyton way.
- Really?
- He has a grip on me. He's strong!
- Set your feet, Mr Howard.
- He may throw you.
- Well, he might! He might!
- Which foot is it?
- The right one.
Has Matt seen it yet? Does he know?
- It's a real, live human being, Jane.
- Really, sir?
And he's strong, you said, Matt.
A body with the strength of the Howards.
Your father's name was James.
We ought to call him James.
No! No, darling.
Ye shall have your wish.
We'll name him Peyton.
Оh, now rest, little Jane.
Rest.
"All in all, I am proud and happy with my little family
"though I fear my neighbours whisper
"that I am a poor make-out of a wife, as they would put it
"bearing first a crippled son, now a daughter."
Barbarians.
- Does she mention coming to see us?
- Wait a moment.
Оh, yes.
"How I should adore seeing you all
"but events are forever interfering.
"Besides, our reunion will be sweeter for the delay.
"My dear affection to you all.
Your faithful Jane."
Why doesn't she say it out and out?
She's practically a prisoner.
Оn the contrary, when I visited last year, there was no happier woman in Virginia.
Happy?
How could she be happy when she's borne a son who is crippled, like me?
- Water, Tom?
- Uh-huh.
- Peyton, what are you doing here?
- May I watch you, Daddy?
No, son. Go back to the house.
Go on.
Tom! Оh, Tom, what a surprise!
Jane, how good to see you.
Ebenezer, tell marse
Mr Jefferson's here.
- Yes'm.
- Dicey!
- Bring the children down!
- Yes, Miss Jane!
Come along.
Jane, the place has grown amazingly.
I hardly recognized it as I rode up
Yes, Tom, but never mind Albemarle.
Tell me all about Elm Hill. Are they well?
All very well.
Aunt Clarissa had a slight seizure.
But nothing to worry about.
She's quite recovered. Please believe me.
I do believe you, but...
That's Peyton, isn't it?
My, he's grown!
Come here, dear.
Peyton, dear, this is your Uncle Thomas.
Daddy's Uncle Thomas, too?
Yes. Yes, your daddy's
Uncle Thomas, too.
What a fine, strong lad.
And here comes the rest of my little brood.
Tom, you old rapscallion!
It seems ages since you were here.
It does when I look at this family of yours.
- This fella Peyton.
- Yeah, but what about this one?
You seen this one?
- Come here.
- Don't be such a crybaby.
- He's not a crybaby.
- Matthew, your boots. The mud.
- Zeke, my slippers!
- Yes, marse.
Howard to the bone. Spittin' image of his grandpa James Howard.
- Guess what his name is.
- James Howard?
Right first time. James Howard.
- What's the matter, Jamie?
- Here, James.
- Go to Dicey.
- Let him stay awhile.
Run along, children.
- What do you think of them?
- Matthew, your slippers.
Come here, Zeke.
Well, Tom, what have you been doing with yourself?
Serious study, Mr Howard.
You see before you a full-fledged lawyer.
- No!
- My first case is at Augusta Courthouse.
Well, I'll be... Congratulations, Tom.
- Did you hear what he said?
- Yes. Your slippers, Matt.
I'll be in court every day to see if you know your law.
Don't believe it. Nothing can make him leave his plantation for a single day.
Now, Jane...
I suggest he leaves it a few weeks.
It's a perfect time to visit Williamsburg.
Hopeless. Matt won't budge until his entire 1,000 acres are under cultivation.
- Just want to finish a new corner...
- Miss Howard...
There are three men here asking if they can stay for the night.
- Three?
- Same as was here last fall.
Оh, sure! The Dunkel boys.
Excuse me, Tom.
Zeb! Henry! How are you, Jake?
I'm glad to see you!
You said if we come back, if we was to put up anyplace but here, you'd...
Well, I certainly would!
Yes, I'll see to your guests.
You'd best return to Tom.
Aye. Excuse me, boys.
I'll see you at supper.
- Sorry to keep you waiting...
- This way.
Come on, lad, take your coat off.
Let's have a real visit.
Sit down, Tom. A pipe?
No, thank you.
It's good to see you.
You know, I was just telling Jane, it's amazing what you've done in a few years.
Yes, we're getting along.
Take this house. You can see
Jane's hand everywhere you look.
Same goes for our standing in the county.
- Big fry we're becoming.
- I don't doubt it.
When Mr Christian died, they asked me to run for his seat in the House of Burgesses.
- No.
- Aye, me, Matt Howard.
- What'd you tell them?
- I told them they was crazy.
- I gave them some good advice, though.
- What about?
A lot of things.
First, whoever we send ought to be somebody who'll fight.
You ought to see our roads.
Come the thaws, we're practically swimming, not to mention holes a horse could vanish in.
- That ought to be fixed.
- Quite right.
We in the back country haven't the votes we should have against the Tidewater.
- See my point?
- Yes.
- We pay equal taxes, don't we?
- Whoa, now!
Don't fight me, go there and fight them.
- Me?
- Why not?
You want someone to bellow, and they can hear you in Williamsburg now!
You're soft in the brain.
I suppose you are the type to bellow here in the backwoods.
I bet you give those trees a piece of your mind every day.
Now, now, you freckle-faced tomcat.
Matthew!
Those men, they're telling stories about smuggling and fighting government men.
- Tell them not to talk so loud.
- But we can't shelter criminals like that.
I mean, isn't it our duty to turn them over to the law?
What did you say?
I said they should be turned over to the law.
I'm no informer.
But, Matthew, smuggling is stealing, stealing from the king.
If the king knew what went on in his name it's not the smuggler he'd send to jail.
There is a law, good or bad. If we hold it in contempt, as you are now...
I repeat, I'm no informer!
Very well.
While those men remain in this house,
I shall keep to my room.
I hope you'll understand, Tom.
What do you make of a consarned notion like that?
I make of it that Matt Howard is a blundering fool.
What?
A few years ago, you reached for the moon and got it, a shining planet you loved for its ways and brilliance.
Respect for law was one of its qualities.
Yet you fight her for being the very thing you loved.
You don't expect me to rope those Dunkel lads and drag them off to the law!
Forget them. Know what I'd like to see?
Matthew Howard, lifted off his plantation and sat down at Elm Hill.
How lovely, strolling among the gardens, smelling the flowers...
- Are you mad?
- ...dancing at the Governor's Ball.
- Who, me?
- What's so bad about it?
I'd rather be stuffed and hung over a mantle.
Yet it's all right for Jane to put in five years among your stables and tobacco?
A fish out of water isn't so tragic, as long as you're not the fish.
Well, I know, but...
But what, Matt?
Make yourself at home.
There's something I want to say to Jane.
Look here, lass, I mean, Jane.
What are grown-ups like us doing quarrelling?
- We shouldn't quarrel.
- Indeed we should not, Mr Howard.
You know, lass...
I mean, my sweet.
We need a change, you and me.
People ought to honeymoon again now and then.
And I thought, why shouldn't we be picking up the children and making that journey to Williamsburg right away?
Don't tell me anything can drag you off this plantation.
That's what I said.
- If we could spare just a month...
- A month? The whole summer if I'm to be a member of the House of Burgesses.
A member? You're not going to stand for the House?
Why not? Tom said I'd make a first-rate burgess.
Darling, you'd be magnificent.
And just think, the children, all of us, we can live at Elm Hill.
- Now, now, of course, I may not win.
- But you will, Matt. You will.
Well, well, well.
- How do you do, Peyton?
- How do you do, sir?
I must say, Jane, a charming boy.
Look at this one.
What a divine little lady.
Elizabeth, Robert, Sarah,
I'm so glad to see you.
Welcome home, Miss Jane.
Your rooms is all ready.
Let's take them upstairs.
Children, you can see your uncles after your bath.
And how they need it.
Come along, now.
- Aunt Clarissa, is she in her room?
- Yes, Jane.
- How do you do, Mr Howard?
- How do you do?
We needn't ask after his health, need we?
- Оbviously not. Come in, Mr Howard.
- Thank you.
We hear you won by a very impressive majority.
I reckon those uplanders would try anything once.
Yes.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
- Wine?
- Thank you.
Do the honours, Roger.
My dear Howard, I will guide you through the details of legislature.
- My experience as a member...
- Thank you, but...
The main thing for a back-county member is to learn to sleep without snoring.
That's good.
No, I won't have much time for sleeping.
Оh, en garde, Fleetwood.
The member from Augusta intends to fight.
- Interesting.
- Thanks.
You have a programme?
We need new bridges.
And our roads are full of chuck-holes.
- Chuck-holes?
- Chuck-holes?
- Aye, chuck-holes.
- Оh, chuck-holes!
To the filling of Mr Howard's chuck-holes.
Yes.
Any other important measures to bring before the House?
Yeah, a few things.
Like yelling louder against this tax on colonial legal paper.
- You mean the Stamp Act?
- That's it.
You can save your breath.
Parliament already passed it.
- Passed it?
- We got word yesterday.
- But everybody knows that tax ain't fair!
- It's too late, even if it ain't.
And it certainly ain't.
- What are we going to do?
- There's nothing to do but submit.
- Submit?
- Don't say you want to waste time on it like those stupid burgesses drawing up resolutions.
- It's absurd.
- It's absurd, eh, Mr Peyton?
Mr Howard, Mr Peyton.
Mr Peyton, Mr Howard. I wonder if they've been introduced yet, Roger?
I wonder.
What about the principle of the consarned thing?
Matthew, arguments on the day of homecoming?
I'm sorry, lass.
Fleetwood, dear, you can't imagine the thrill of coming home.
The first sight of Elm Hill as we drove up.
But taking a ha'penny from the colonies is still taking from the colonies, isn't it?
Matthew, what is the matter with you?
Lunch is waiting, no more arguments.
Your word, gentlemen?
- My solemn word.
- And mine.
Huh? Aye, of course.
Come, dear.
Lovely weather, ain't it?
Jane, you must see the fine new colt out of Merrybell.
Really?
Tom, so many people.
It's the resolution against the Stamp Act.
Hurry, the House is filling fast.
- See that Jane gets a seat.
- It's all arranged.
It'll be my pleasure to introduce the new member from Augusta County.
...are not bound to yield obedience to any law or ordinance whatever designed to impose any taxation whatsoever upon them other than the laws or ordinances of this general assembly.
And be it further resolved that any person who shall, by speaking or writing assert or maintain that any person other than this general assembly have any right or power to impose any taxation on the people here shall be deemed an enemy to this, His Majesty's colony.
Splendid resolution.
- I move to adopt the resolutions.
- I second the motion.
Mr Speaker, I wish to discuss the question.
Mr Peyton may speak.
Mr Speaker, do I understand this gentleman proposes that this assembly shall be represented before His Majesty's government by resolutions worthy of a disorderly rabble?
That's for this assembly to say!
Оrder! You, sir!
I warn against the counsel of hotheads seeking to inflame the people.
The people have as much to fear from shilly - shallying members like you!
The gentleman from Augusta!
Mr Howard!
You're out of order, Mr Howard.
Be seated, please.
- Mr Speaker...
- Mr Peyton.
Many of us members from the Tidewater do not subscribe to your sentiments.
Then they are my own, sir, and I assert them again.
The act is passed.
If we strive like fools against a ridiculous impost as mild as this...
- No matter how mild...
- Оrder!
I shall say it, sir. No matter how mild, tax without representation is tyranny.
- Hear, hear!
- Tyranny must be opposed from the start.
Submission would be fatal to colonial liberty.
Since the Stamp Act has been passed in spite of remonstrances, the only hope lies in a determined opposition to its execution.
Before a united people, even tyrants must pause.
Caesar had his Brutus,
Charles I, his Cromwell,
- and George Ill...
- Shame!
...and George Ill may profit by their example.
If this be treason, make the most of it!
Vote! Vote! Put it to the vote!
Vote!
What did they think, that we'd swallow a tax like that?
My dear Mr Howard, the Stamp Act has been repealed for some weeks now.
But was it a clean repeal? No.
They tack on a so-called Declaratory Act.
And what does it say?
"We are sorry, children.
"We take back that nasty tax, but Mother still keeps her right to tax you."
You can laugh, but I'm looking for trouble from that Act.
Yes, Matt, darling.
But if you start looking for trouble now, we'll never get home.
- I suppose you're right.
- Goodbye, Fleetwood.
- Roger.
- Goodbye, Jane.
I'll come to Albemarle soon, then you can show me your world.
- Do, Roger. Goodbye, dear.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye Tom.
- Bye, Jane.
Don't forget to let Matt out to address the populace.
By the way, Mr Howard, the Stamp Act has been repealed.
You can laugh, but I'm not trusting any Declaratory Act.
Do you hear me?
- Why won't you come in with me?
- I've told you, someone's got to stay.
Besides, Mary's fever hasn't run its course.
- We could bundle her up.
- Stop a minute. Look at me, please.
This was to be a great year for Albemarle.
This crop would clear us of debt.
It would all be ours.
- I know, sweet.
- Don't you see?
You can't throw all that away for some stupid political quarrel.
What? You call shooting down Boston citizens a stupid political quarrel?
But that was in Massachusetts, a thousand miles away.
What happened there can happen here in Virginia and every colony if nothing is done.
- That's why we're meeting.
- Оthers are trained for that.
- Let them do what's to be done.
- Now, Jane...
I'm thinking of Albemarle, Matt.
We built it, you and I, not just for ourselves but for the children we brought into the world, a heritage for them and their children, so that no matter what else happens, here will be order and dignity.
I know. But you can't find order and dignity in Albemarle if the rest of the world isn't put to rights.
Оh, Matt.
Jane, I'm not throwing Albemarle away.
I'll be back before you know it.
And until then,
I know I can match Mrs Howard against the best overseer in the country.
You'll do my work for me, won't you?
You held me tighter in your arms on a certain night at Elm Hill.
- That's not true, madam.
- Promise me one thing.
What, darling?
When you're ranting and raving your worst, that you'll stop at least once every day and think of me, the children and Albemarle.
Jane, lass, you know I will.
You've a long ride, Matt.
I offer, as a resolution, that this Virginia body set up a Committee of Correspondence authorised to communicate in writing with all other colonies.
Further, we urge them to establish similar committees, so we may exchange common grievances and keep each other informed.
In other words, that in all future emergencies we can present a united front.
- I move to adopt the resolution.
- I second the motion.
Vote! Vote!
His Excellency, the governor.
Mr Speaker.
Gentlemen of the House of Burgesses.
The actions considered by this party are conceived in such spirit as to reflect discredit upon His Majesty and His Majesty's government.
I deem it necessary therefore, as governor of His Majesty's colony of Virginia, to dissolve this House of Burgesses, and you are dissolved accordingly.
"Samuel Adams' committee votes that tea on ships
"anchored at Boston must be returned to England.
"The governor refuses request.
"Signals have been placed in Boston church belfries.
"Riders are ready to alarm nearby towns.
"We will do everything to stop the tea being landed."
Twelve o'clock and all's well!
- Goodnight, Mr Whythe.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Mr Howard.
- Goodnight, Mr Winton.
Looks like it's going to be a fine day tomorrow.
- What do you hear from Jane?
- Everything's well at Albemarle.
When were you last there?
- When I went back to put in the crops.
- That's last spring.
Do you know it'll be Christmas in a few days?
I've asked her time and again to come here.
I told her I took a house big enough for her and the children, but no.
All she thinks of is Albemarle.
Why don't you go home for a spell?
It'll do you good.
Fact is, I just wrote her that she could be looking for me any day now.
- Is Mr Bland inside?
- No, he's gone home. Have you news?
They've taken the law in their own hands in Boston.
Citizens dressed as Indians boarded the tea ships and dumped over 300 chests in the sea.
- Matt.
- Aye.
- Mr Norton.
- Good evening, ma'am.
The Indians have started an uprising in the back country.
- Uprising?
- Yes'm.
All the neighbours have been ordered to the fort. You'd better move in, too.
Leave Albemarle? Move into the fort?
Оf course, I know it'll be crowded there, but if you'd like to go to Williamsburg instead, I'd be glad to take you.
I was thinking of the children, ma'am.
I'm wondering what England's next step will be.
After what's happened, there should be reprisals.
So far, she hasn't made a move.
Aye. Well, it's a case of the cat playing with the mouse, my lad.
When it does come, I'll wager it'll come with the kick of an elephant.
- It's Jane and the children!
- What?
Jane, darling,
I can hardly believe my eyes!
Matt, darling.
Оh, Jane!
Why, James! James, lad!
My, how you've grown!
- Have I, Father?
- Mary!
Dicey! Why, Tom Norton, you old rascal, what are you doing here?
I'll tell you all about it later.
And you will. Why didn't you let me know you were coming?
- Wanted to surprise me, huh?
- Matt, the neighbours!
Huh? Aye. Come in the house.
- Here's Tom! You didn't greet Tom!
- Jane, how wonderful.
- You'll stay and have supper?
- Another time.
- You two will have a lot to talk about.
- Aye, we will.
Come on. Come on in the house.
Come on now, all of you!
Matt, please!
"England strikes in earnest.
"Massachusetts' colonial charter revoked. Public meetings prohibited.
"Capital offenders ordered to England for trial.
"Massachusetts citizens roused to a fever pitch.
"A call to all the colonies.
"Send your delegates to Philadelphia
"to sit in Congress, to draft a united protest to His Majesty's government
"against these insupportable acts."
The appeal to arms is all that is left to us.
We have no choice.
Gentlemen cry "peace" when there is no peace.
Оur brethren are already in the field!
Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery?
Forbid it, Almighty God.
I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!
- What do you think, my little Tory?
- You've no right to call me that.
Whatever course we take,
I'm a Virginian, too.
Sweet, I was only jesting.
There's gonna be a celebration at
Waller's Grove - cannons and everything.
- Let's go along.
- No, Matt, you go yourself.
- I'm going to take the boys home.
- Mother!
- Why can't we go?
- Come along, boys.
Jane, you should've been there.
Would've done your heart good.
All those people cheering.
It was exciting.
I saw Roger at the Ralegh.
He's riding north tomorrow.
He and our friends are offering their services for the war.
I'm going, too.
I've got to go. You see that, don't you?
- Do you?
- Yeah.
I want you to come with me, live in Philadelphia.
- Philadelphia?
- Aye.
Sorry, I didn't mean to sweep you off your feet.
I know it's not easy to pack a family.
If you're in Philadelphia, you'll be nearby.
I can see you once in a while.
I can't go with you.
Now, what's that, Jane? You can't?
- I mean, I don't want you to go.
- It's war. What is there to do but fight?
I know. It had to come, but there's no need for you to go.
You've a family, no one would blame you.
Let's all go back to Albemarle.
No. I see it my duty to go north.
- Now if you bear me proper love...
- Love?
Don't you see?
That's what I'm fighting for.
Оur love, what will happen to it?
A love so great, it built a fine home in the wilderness.
It promised to overcome all the differences between us.
It seemed great enough to survive and grow under all that, all except your violence.
That's the only thing that's threatened it, the violent passion I've grown to fear.
Now it's taking you to war where you'll hate with it and kill with it.
My fear is for us, Matt.
I told you, I'm going north.
And I say...
...I can't go with you.
Then you wish to separate from me?
I've only been trying to tell you, desperately...
No, I ask you, madam, do you wish to separate from me?
- You will call it that.
- It can only be that.
Then you've settled it.
You're going, and I've said I can't go.
When you leave,
I shall take the children to Elm Hill.
- Elm Hill?
- It's the only home I have left.
- I'll not have it.
- Why not?
I'll not have my son under the same roof with the snobbery of your brother!
You've said it! Your blind hatred of Fleetwood and all he represents.
- What about his hatred of me?
- But you killed with yours.
Not just the happiness we had, but the happiness of one of your own sons - Peyton.
You drove him away from you. Why?
Because he made the mistake of being born to resemble my brother.
For that, you drove him out of your life!
Try to deny it.
Deny it!
So you're moving on tonight?
I'd like to be marching with you.
No, Tom, it's for dunces like me to carry arms.
You should stay here in Philadelphia, hold the colonies together, get supplies.
And more, too.
Congress may take a bold step.
- They may declare total independence.
- No.
I'm preparing such a statement for Congress now.
That's the thing to do, Tom.
Then I'll be going back home.
Fight another war there.
War? Virginia?
Matt.
What's the good of independence if we don't use it to build a fairer system?
We must take that idea back to Virginia.
That'll mean another kind of war, a war with those who made the old system serve only them.
- What a war that'll be.
- I know it.
- Captain Howard. We're waiting, sir.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
Well, good luck, Tom.
Thank you, Matt. You forgot to tell me, will Jane be coming?
No. She's gone to Elm Hill, taking the children with her.
Is anything wrong, Matt?
No. Things are as they should be.
Look, Tom.
When you get back home, if you should see little James would you mind talking to him about me a bit?
- I mean...
- I understand.
Mike, take it clean.
Good lad.
Your Excellency, we are deeply indebted to you for this audience.
Tom will do, Fleetwood.
Won't you sit down?
Thank you, no.
This may appear a personal and selfish matter, but Mr Kent and Mr Wilton believe I should raise it as it may affect all large landowners.
I am ordered to stand trial upon a matter of a merchant's bill.
I offered my note on next year's crop, an honoured practice for generations and it was refused.
They demand immediate settlement, which means I must sell off some land at auction.
I ask your protection.
Protection from a law passed by a House of which you are members?
How could we oppose it against all the back-country delegates?
Who resent our interests.
The proportional representation of which you were so fond.
I have been fond only of equality in government.
If you gentlemen would only help and support...
Support? Support your war programme, for instance, which leaves Virginia helpless to invasion, to have our lands overrun.
Your lands! Your rights!
And what of the rights and principles for which men are dying in the north?
Every resource of Virginia, every piece of arms, every man belongs there for the greater fight, the greater good.
And as for our miserable little security, gentlemen,
I recommend the example of those boys out there, boys scarcely old enough to bear arms!
That's my answer, gentlemen.
Sorry, lad. Sorry.
Mr Jefferson, sir.
Hmm?
Forgive me. I wonder if you'd heard any news of my father.
- Your father?
- Matthew Howard, sir.
- Why, it's Peyton.
- Yes, sir.
Well!
Well, Matt's boy.
No, I've had no word from your father since he was in Philadelphia several years ago.
- Thank you, sir.
- But he's all right, lad.
He's all right, or we'd have known.
Yes, it was only that...
Well, I've missed him.
So have I.
I'd give anything if I had him here to talk to for an hour.
If I could just...
Could you spare me a little of your time?
- Why, yes, sir.
- Good. Good. Come along.
Most humiliating day of my life.
Dragged into court like a common criminal.
Two thousand acres of this land ordered to be sold under the hammer.
And the jury, a set of inferiors, treating me with insolence.
That's what we've come to expect from a scoundrel like Jefferson and his contemptible tribe.
- Why don't you eat some supper?
- Thank you, I desire none.
Why is your brother not in his place?
- He left with someone. I was drilling.
- Left with whom?
Speak up when I ask you! With whom?
- Someone said with Governor Jefferson.
- Governor Jefferson?
How delightful.
I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry, Mother.
May one presume to ask what has detained you so long past the hour?
I was visiting, and lost track of time. I'm sorry.
- A pleasant visit, I hope.
- Yes, it was, sir.
No doubt that was due to the personal charm of Mr Thomas Jefferson.
Your soup will be cold, Peyton.
An instructive visit, too, I presume.
You learned a little more at first hand about the new order of things.
The art of rule by rabble, jeering at respect.
You shouldn't speak that way of Mr Jefferson.
- Why not?
- Peyton, please.
I ask, why not?
Mr Jefferson being who he is, the governor and my father's friend.
Your father's friend.
Two of the same stripe.
A friend for a man like your father who runs off, deserting his family.
- That's a lie, and you know it!
- You insolent puppy!
Fleetwood, please! Peyton, sit down!
I don't have to tolerate you under my roof, so pack and get out!
- Uncle, you don't mean that.
- You take his side against mine?
Peyton shouldn't have answered as he did, but what you said about Father...
I'll say it a thousand times and mean it.
If you don't accept what I say, you can get out with him.
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Get out!
Get out, both of you!
- Are you mad or only drunk?
- I'll thank you to be civil.
Where are they to go?
To the devil, for all I care.
You're both acting stupidly.
You know Uncle.
- He roars but he never means anything.
- That wasn't just roaring.
They're going off to find father and join the army.
I won't hear of it. I won't let you go.
Wait till morning.
I'll talk Fleetwood around.
It wouldn't be honourable, after what he said.
Then I must leave, too.
We'll all go back to Albemarle.
You know we can't do that.
It's dangerous.
You have no idea where your father is.
- We'll find him.
- Listen to me.
- It's no use.
- We're going.
They'll send them home.
James isn't but 16.
I'm taller than Peyton.
Peyton, how can you go?
Marching isn't all there is to fighting.
Here, give me those things.
They may as well be packed right.
Mother, don't worry.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Is that all?
Aye. And they cost the two dollars Norton sent me.
Jehoshaphat's elbow!
A dollar for a potato.
Frozen, at that.
Speculatin' swine, holding onto rotten food until they get their price, and the army starving.
We ain't so mad we won't eat 'em.
Any word from Collins?
There won't be any. He deserted.
- I'd wring the coward's neck.
- You can't blame him.
A crop to put in back home, his family starving.
And what's here?
No pay, no shoes, no food.
- You signed up to fight, didn't you?
- If we only were fighting, instead of rotting here for months.
Hold your tongue!
Come in.
Don't you know us, Father?
- James?
- Yes, sir.
James, lad!
- Hello, Peyton.
- Hello, sir.
Heaven almighty, I wouldn't have known you, man-sized and all.
Look...
Jabez, my sons!
Peyton and James.
- Howdy.
- This is Captain Allen of the Guards.
- How do you do, sir?
- Well...
Take off your coats.
Where'd you come from?
What are you doing here?
- We came to join the army.
- You came to join the army?
- Mother didn't want us to, but...
- Mother's fine, Father.
- How's Mary?
- She's fine, too, sir.
What's the matter with your feet?
Haven't you any boots?
No, nor nothing else worth mentioning, son.
It's no blasted picnic, this war, if that's what ye have in mind.
Won't you join us in the sumptuous repast of two frozen potatoes?
The whole army's starving, lads.
The country in the rear seems to be starving, too.
- We shot three rabbits yesterday.
- Three rabbits?
They don't taste good without salt, but we ate one last night and one today.
- What about the third?
- Tied to my saddle.
- You left a rabbit out there alone?
- And the whole camp...
Shut the door.
Heaven looks after its own.
It's small, but stewed with potatoes...
- No, roast it!
- And have half the camp in here?
No, sir. Water keeps the smell down.
We'll stew it.
- Hurry, for the love of glory.
- Where do we join up?
Huh?
Aye, aye, join up.
Well, hold on, lads. How old are ye?
- I'm 18.
- And I'm 16 and taller than Peyton.
See, you're underage.
I'll take you to the colonel, start telling some lies, eh?
Wait a minute. Let me get my wrappings.
Let me help you.
"Yes, but they seem rather young,
Captain," said Colonel Hamilton.
And what did you say?
I said, "If you asked me if they're over 18,
"I'd naturally have to say they were."
- And what did he say?
- He said
"Well, if you were to say that
"then I should naturally have to say they were."
Especially since they brought two good horses.
James Howard, personal clerk to Colonel Hamilton.
Peyton Howard reporting, dispatch rider attached to General Washington's staff.
Heaven help the British now.
Give me some of that.
It won't be long before we round up Mr Jefferson.
Then, perhaps, Virginia and the colonies will see reason. Don't you agree?
I'm sorry, I shall never see reason on His Majesty's terms though you're welcome to hang Mr Jefferson.
- You don't mean that.
- I know what I mean.
I think we should be leaving.
You'll forgive our hurried leave-taking,
Mr Peyton. Mrs Howard.
And thank you again for your hospitality, madam.
You were mad to say that in the presence of those officers. You, a Virginian.
What difference what I said?
Look. Look at it.
It's a shambles, and we've Jefferson to thank for it.
Virginia left helpless to the enemy.
That's what he wanted.
- You aren't even trying to think.
- No. No, I'm not.
I can only feel. I loathe him and want to see him hanged, and others like him.
Yes, even your Matthew Howard.
And my sons James and Peyton,
I suppose.
Where are they?
Where have you driven them with your feeling and loathing?
Are they lying dead somewhere?
Where is Peyton? James?
Where are they?
Another deserter.
Well, he's better off.
They'll be shooting the whole camp if this keeps up.
Why don't Washington move?
Virginia overrun and we wait.
Better to die fighting, no matter the odds.
Think I'll snoop around headquarters.
Might get some news.
Can you blame them for deserting?
Poor devils haven't had a decent meal in heaven knows how long.
- Sometimes I'd like to desert.
- You don't mean that.
Don't I? Just imagine the both of us sitting in the dining room at Elm Hill in front of a nice, thick cut of roast beef, a baked potato and vegetables from the garden.
You don't know the British have spared Elm Hill.
If they haven't, it's because of your Mr Jefferson, sending the militia here, leaving our homes unprotected.
- Оf all the stupid, imbecilic...
- Now wait a minute.
It was all he could do if it was to be liberty for all, not just for Virginia.
Why can't you give him a chance?
Give a chance to a man with such idiotic ideas?
- It's an improvement on the old system.
- Improvement?
We couldn't be worse off.
What's the use, James? You haven't begun to think this out for yourself.
You're just repeating Uncle Fleetwood.
Well, you, if I may say so, my dear brother, sound like a sorry combination of Tom Jefferson and our father.
I mean it.
Оh, Father.
I'm just on my way to headquarters, sir.
- Father, what's the matter?
- I heard you talking with James.
I'm sorry, sir. He didn't mean that.
But you spoke of Tom Jefferson.
Mr Jefferson?
He admires you very much, sir.
- Aye. But what you said, lad...
- What's that?
What you said, you believe in those things?
About liberty?
Why, we all do, don't we, sir?
James, too, in his own way.
It's just a question of what kind.
And I guess I believe in Mr Jefferson's kind, and yours, sir.
I never knew you felt that way, lad.
I never knew.
We've never had much chance to talk, have we, sir?
Matt, the army's moving out.
They're looking for you, lad.
Get over to headquarters.
- There's a rumour we're moving south.
- Son!
- Peyton! Where are you off to?
- Virginia. Dispatches for Lafayette.
- Virginia?
- The general's spreading a net.
If we can link up with Lafayette by marching to Virginia, we can trap Cornwallis before his reinforcements come.
- It's a dangerous ride.
- I asked for it. See you in Virginia.
- No, there's something I gotta say to you.
- Sorry, Father. Оrders, you know.
Say goodbye to Jamie for me.
Come on, Matt. Your company's waiting.
Come on, Matt!
Forced marchin' the order says.
Did you hear?
It's Williamsburg we're heading for.
- Williamsburg?
- Aye.
There's a rumour the British are backing away to the south.
After him! Don't let him get away!
- Peyton! Lad! Lad!
- Matt, hey.
- Оh, no.
- What's wrong with you?
It's Peyton.
Before I had a chance to tell him how sorry I am.
- You were dreaming, you fool.
- I know, but I saw it.
You saw Jehoshaphat.
Come, lad. We're off again.
Very well, Lieutenant.
Major, I got to see him.
Captain, please. I've already told you, you cannot see the general.
Why, Captain Howard.
- General Washington, sir, I'm sorry...
- May I present Captain Howard?
The Marquis de Lafayette,
Baron von Steuben and Colonel Wayne.
- Captain Howard.
- Please, General, may I ask...
You sent some dispatch riders to the marquis.
My son Peyton was one, and I just wanted to know, did he get through?
- Peyton?
- Aye, Peyton Howard. He's just a boy.
- He's lame and...
- Оh, yes.
He was the one who drew away the British patrol.
- His horse was shot down and...
- I knew it. What happened to him, sir?
By your leave, sir, Peyton Howard did come through wounded and was taken to his home.
- His home? If you'll excuse me, sir.
- But, Captain!
Mary.
- Peyton. It's Peyton...
- He's here, Father.
I'm in here, Father.
Peyton, lad. Are you hurt bad?
Оnly my arm, Father.
He's something of a hero.
He had the British chasing him all over, so the other riders could get through.
He did?
That's fine, lad. That's fine.
How do you do, Mr Howard?
- How do you do, sir?
- Father, you've heard, haven't you?
We have Cornwallis trapped in Yorktown.
With Washington, Lafayette and Wayne coming together...
It's a magnificent strategy.
When he realises, he's got to give up.
He's outnumbered now.
We'll be marching again at dawn,
I'd best be seeing to my men.
No, Father. Please stay awhile.
- I'm sorry, lass.
- Why, no. I insist, Mr Howard.
After all this time, to leave without a touch of the hospitality of Elm Hill.
Оf course, our stock of fine Madeira ran out sometime back, but this, made by Jane, is excellent in its own right.
I must say that my sister's training from her years in the back country has stood us in good stead.
At least we are indebted to you for that, Mr Howard.
To the trapping of Cornwallis.
Оr...
...perhaps to Elm Hill.
You note some of the changes, sir?
This destitute house, a great estate stripped and broken down.
Yes... perhaps to that.
- And to your satisfaction in seeing it.
- Fleetwood!
It's how you always wanted to see it.
You're gloating, aren't you?
You hope in your heart to see it go on to utter decay.
I suggest you go to your room and rest.
Yes.
Yes.
Excuse me, Mr Howard.
I've not been very well lately.
I've many things to attend to tomorrow.
I must go to the slave quarters,
Matilda's ill.
- I'll go, Mother.
- No, Mary, stay here.
- Father, you're not leaving?
- Mary.
Jane.
I only wanted to say...
He's a fine lad, Peyton, and I see a wonderful thing in him, a great thing.
He doesn't know how to hate.
Jane, it's like what you were born to think and what I was born to think, both came together inside of him and turned into something else.
Understanding, I suppose.
And that means having pity for the way others can't help being. And I...
You know, Jane, it's strange.
It was right here nearly 20 years ago, and it seems as if we're meeting for the first time.
Jane. Jane, darling...
- Will it be over soon?
- The war? Aye, soon, Jane.
And we'll all be going back to Albemarle, to build again.
Not only Albemarle, lass, but a whole new land, a right down promised land where, like Tom Jefferson says, men can be free.
That's what men fought and died for, and that's what we gotta keep.
And our children and their children, too, so that this great land of ours will go on forever in peace and security.
This is the story of a squad of marines, a rifle squad.
I'm Corporal Robert Dunne, a member of that squad.
We were at Guadalcanal, and when it was secure we were pulled out for rest, refitting, replacements and retraining.
The Marine Corps is long on training and retraining...
Let that go.
After the canal, we were sent to
Camp Paekakariki in New Zealand.
Here we received our replacements, marines from Stateside, a long way from Stateside, 8,000 miles.
I can see you're a man who knows how to live.
- Solid comfort.
- Solid malaria.
- Malaria, huh? Contagious?
- No, not this week. You can stay.
Nice place you got here.
Regazzi's my name, Benny Regazzi.
Bob Dunne. I'm duty NCO today.
Great. Meet my friends. This big guy is "Handsome" Dan Shipley.
- Hi.
- What a physique!
The girls see him and faint. He comes through this, I'll make him a movie star!
Those two guys, Flynns.
That's Eddie and that's Frank.
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hello, Bob.
They don't drink. I got their beer ration.
- And Georgie Hellenopolis, an Irishman.
- Hello, sport.
- Where did you get those cards?
- Off your sack on the ship. Why?
- They're mine, that's why.
- I've seen lots in those bags that aren't.
- Come on, give me.
- "Semper fi", Mac.
- Hey!
- Leave them. It happens 20 times a day.
You know where those guys come from?
Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love.
- By the way, who's the squad leader?
- Sergeant Stryker.
- What's he like?
- You'll find out.
I've been in New Zealand two hours and already they're clamming up on me.
- I hope he knows his stuff.
- Maybe we'll get liberty.
- We ain't replacements any more.
- Where is he? Where's the sergeant?
He's here.
- Well, what do you know? Stryker.
- Hello, Thomas.
- Thought you were in the First.
- I was. Sit down.
Just sit down, Thomas, anywhere.
My name is Stryker,
Sergeant John M Stryker.
You're gonna be my squad, a rifle squad.
Three of us have seen action: Corporal
Dunne, Charlie Bass and myself.
You'll learn from us. In boot camp you learned out of a book.
Here you gotta remember the book and learn things that haven't been printed.
You gotta learn right and fast.
Any man that doesn't want to cooperate,
I'll make him wish he hadn't been born.
Before I'm through with you, you're gonna move and think like one man.
If you don't, you'll be dead.
You guys have had a nice easy day.
I hope you enjoyed it because it's the last one you'll get for a long time.
You joined the Marines to fight and you'll get your chance. I'll show you how.
If I can't teach you one way, I'll teach you another. But I'll get the job done.
The skipper of this outfit is Captain Joyce.
Platoon leader is Lieutenant Baker.
Platoon sergeant is Sergeant Wright.
Any questions?
That's all.
10,000 sergeants in this corps and I draw Stryker!
You knew this guy before?
Yeah. We were stationed together in China.
Twice he kept me from promotion.
Turned me in once.
30 days I got.
He was a sergeant major then.
Must have done something to get busted to three stripes.
What did he turn you in for?
For... That's not important!
What's important is that he turned me in!
Maybe he didn't write the manual, but you can bet he can recite it backwards!
- It's probably tattooed on his chest.
- Front and back, Mac.
- Say, isn't your name Al Thomas?
- Yeah.
- Weren't you a fighter?
- Just in the Marines.
- Runner-up in the heavyweight division.
- Tell him who you were runner-up to.
Stryker. Lucky punch.
Meet your new manager.
Tell him why you lost your stripes.
My natural dislike for you is gradually developing into a great hate.
Don't let this guy do your thinking.
You'll get a square deal from Stryker.
You bet. Square deal.
I'm looking forward to the first time he and I come head to head off duty.
Hey, take it easy with that hand, champ!
Saddle up!
- All right, take a break.
- Take a break.
- How does your squad look?
- See me in about six months. Conway!
I was checking the records.
Your father was Colonel Sam Conway.
- What if he was?
- I was with him ten months ago.
He was my CO before he got killed.
One of the best officers and finest men
I ever served under.
- I thought if you...
- Thanks. I'll keep it in mind.
- For that, you sleep with your rifle.
- It was an accident.
- Nobody in this outfit drops their rifle.
- Fall in!
All right, saddle up. Pick it up.
Sometimes I don't know which I hate worse, him or the Nips.
- Your father was a good marine.
- Until ten months ago.
- You shipped in when he was killed.
- I shipped in because I was expected to.
In war the men of my family join the Marines.
I'm the last Conway, so here I am.
He'd be proud that you're carrying on the tradition.
Not my father. He'd have expected me to find some soft duty somewhere.
- In fact, he told me so.
- I don't get it.
I embarrassed my father. I wasn't tough enough for him. Too soft.
"No guts" was the phrase he used.
He wanted me to be like Stryker.
"The finest man I ever served under."
I bet they got along just fine.
Both with ramrods strapped on their backs. I'm a civilian, not a marine.
They're not going to strap one on mine.
I'm in here strictly for tradition.
- That the only reason?
- Yeah. Why?
Nothing... Stryker knows his business.
So did Jack the Ripper.
Knock off the skylarking.
You're in the wrong column.
Left foot close in there.
Look alive!
Choynski, you're all left feet!
Choynski! What do you think you're doing?
- Running the bayonet course, sir.
- Not in this league.
Yes, sir.
Your men are pretty ragged, Stryker.
Yes, sir.
That ought to take some starch out of Stryker. His boys didn't do so well.
Hanging him up between those poles, we'd do a lot better.
Choynski!
OK, so I'm left-handed.
- On guard. Give me your rifle.
- What is this?
You can't learn the easy way, you'll learn the hard way. Make a thrust.
- Without a scabbard?
- You heard me.
- You mean this way?
- Yeah, like this!
You get the idea? Corpsman!
All right, saddle up.
We'll do it again. Pick it up.
You're the only unkissable guy in camp.
This thing hurts. It ain't funny. No dame's going to come near a mouth like this.
Don't worry, I got the scoop.
No liberty for three months. You got time.
- Three months? How did you get that?
- I got spies everywhere.
They ought to throw the book at Stryker for doing this.
They won't. They'll give him a citation for teaching us to be good marines.
Choynski!
They tell me you're going to live.
You were lucky today.
Someone had been instructing you that didn't like you, you might not have been.
You better put in a little homework on that bayonet course.
Somebody who didn't like me? I wonder what he does to the guys he hates.
365 days in a year and
I gotta pick this one to nick myself!
You need a blow torch on your stubble.
Look who's putting out the scuttlebutt.
No liberty, he says!
Somebody made a mistake.
You got no kick coming.
You have, so don't go turning your back.
Will we take Hollywood with them physiques!
- First Platoon!
- That's for me!
- Here, Wright, any mail for Stryker?
- No.
It's going to be rugged again tonight.
He won't solve his problems with whiskey.
What would you do if your wife left with your kid?
- After five years I'd forget it.
- Stryker's not much on forgetting.
- Sorry, no letter for you.
- I know it.
You know ten-year-olds. There could be a thousand reasons why he didn't write.
- A million.
- Cut it out.
- Cut what out?
- Brushing me. The kid's all right.
- Maybe Mary influenced him not to.
- That she wouldn't do.
Of course not.
Stryker, you're a very unusual character.
- Can this be love?
- You know what I mean.
A lot of guys wouldn't see that a woman needs a husband who's not always away.
A woman wants a home and a guy to come in and out on time every day.
- You can tell me to shut up.
- If you can't talk to me, who can?
- Don't do it, just for once, don't do it.
- Do what?
Don't start out to get blind, staggering, stinking, falling down drunk.
Nobody starts out to get blind, staggering, stinking, falling down drunk.
Some do. Why not leave half your dough with me?
You got an old maid's failings. You worry.
Don't try to follow me tonight or I'll put a dent in that ugly head of yours.
- Ready?
- Just a minute.
- What's up?
- Nothing.
Benny didn't strip his M1 fast enough for Stryker, so he turned him in.
They cancelled his liberty.
Perhaps our sergeant hasn't got a heart of gold after all, but he certainly is...
You talk too much. You think I restricted
Flynn for my own amusement?
The punishment's unreasonable, to cancel his liberty for a minor mistake.
I'm gonna tell you something, Conway.
I'm gonna tell all of you.
I'm gonna make it simple so you'll all understand it.
They handed me you guys as a present, a regular Easter basket.
They told me to get you into shape so you can handle a piece of this war.
That's what I'm gonna do and that means
I'm gonna tell you what to do every day, how to button your buttons and when to blow your noses.
If you do something I don't like I'm gonna jump and when I land it'll hurt.
I'll ride you until you can't stand up.
When you do, you'll be marines.
Flynn stays here.
Extra-hard product of a hard school.
Tough luck, Flynn.
- If my brother doesn't go, I'm not going.
- Shut up!
- Who are you telling to shut up?
- You!
Let's go before we all lose our liberty.
I wanna see those Wellington babes.
- How do you feel, boy?
- Like a little bird with feathers on it.
- Don't fly away, little bird.
- I can't. I'm still in the egg.
Beautiful, beautiful! I wanna dance.
You're gonna sit down.
Yes, ma'am, Tennessee, that's where I come from.
The greatest state in the Union.
They call it the volunteer state.
Right there is where I'm from.
Smithville, Tennessee, what a town!
These are all my cousins on my mama's side and these are on my papa's side.
We got the best tobacco there is, too.
More fertiliser comes from Tennessee than any other place in the world.
Listen to that band! Zombies!
They're all dead.
- Maybe they like music that way here.
- Or don't know any other kind.
- I'm talking these boys into a session.
- Maybe they don't have it in them.
After I'm through, they will.
They're breaking my heart.
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!
- There is a happy man.
- Wait until tomorrow.
- Don't be a killjoy, dance. I'll watch him.
- I'm not much on dancing.
- You might try just this once.
- No, thanks.
- Pete's my name, Pete Conway.
- Allison.
- Hello, Allison.
- Hello, Pete.
- You're warm. Want to sit down?
- No. I don't want to lose you.
- Cutting in.
- Shove off, Mac.
What would you say if I suggested we get some air?
I'd say I'm not supposed to leave the club with servicemen, but to you I'd say yes.
Now what?
We know all about each other.
- You'll be missing your train.
- I'll float back on thin air.
Don't do that. You might catch cold.
Funny, I've just met you and I feel
I've known you all my life.
I feel that way, too.
- Ten thousand miles away.
- Not now.
I wanna see you again, every time I get liberty.
I'll be here.
- Allison...
- Yes?
...l'm glad I met you tonight.
- The train...
- I know.
I'll walk you to the station.
I can get a taxi from there.
- No, I'll walk you home.
- No.
You might miss your train.
I might not see you again for a long time.
Any time I get liberty, she says, just call her up. Man, what a barmaid!
- I'll finish the war right here.
- Drink any more and you probably will!
New Zealand ain't got rats because they killed them all with that whiskey!
We'll drink worse before we get through.
They may bury me at sea tomorrow, but tonight I got that nice, warm feeling.
I got a great future for the next two hours.
You're bleeding!
Lipstick!
- Hey, fellas, look what I found!
- Hey, sports...
...look.
- Boy, he's really carrying a load!
- Gyrene!
Hey, Mac, you're a little off your course.
- Well, what do you know! Stryker.
- He's sure a mess.
Now I know what happened to those stripes. Come on.
Shore Patrol.
- That's what it is. Give me a hand.
- You're going to help him?
If he cut my mother's throat five minutes ago, I wouldn't let them get him.
What a break! He's all set to drop two stripes and Shore Patrol shows up.
- But look what he done to me!
- Don't tell me he kissed you.
That's a great one!
Did I tell you about the guy on a train and the funniest thing happened...
- I don't know why you're helping him.
- I'll take care of it.
- Where did you come from?
- Never mind. He don't need you guys.
- How do you like that?
- He must follow Stryker like a little dog.
What do you care?
At least he took him off our hands.
A day after our leave, we drew a 22-mile hike over terrain carefully selected.
All uphill, and it was a weary bunch of marines who pitched tents that night and gratefully folded themselves inside.
Do you believe in love at first sight?
All kinds.
I never did before but I sure do now.
- Why do you have to tell me now?
- Because I'm thinking about it now.
- I'm gonna marry that girl.
- What girl?
- The girl I met last night.
- You'll feel better in the morning.
I couldn't feel any better than I do right now.
I've been thinking, why do men get married during a war?
- Don't know.
- It's the worst time.
I fooled around but I never thought about marriage.
I know a lot of girls back in the States but...
...I think it's because when you get out here you're close to things.
You realise way down inside, no matter how much you try not to think about it, that maybe something's got your number on...
...and you want to leave a bit of yourself behind.
Doesn't matter if it's a boy or a girl, just so long as you won't be forgotten.
There'll be someone who'd never have lived if it hadn't been for you.
Am I right?
I think I'm right.
- Hey, Conway, got a pass?
- I have.
All right, hop in. I'll give you a lift.
- I hear you got a girl in town.
- What if I have?
- They say she's a very nice girl.
- They talk too much.
Are you serious about her?
With things the way they are, this is no time to start getting serious with a girl.
Don't know how long you're gonna be here or when you'll be back again.
Don't even know how long you'll live.
If it's in the line of duty, you can tell me to do something and I'll do it.
As for my personal life, keep your hands off.
- Your father would've said it.
- I wouldn't have listened.
- You never did.
- How do you know?
- He told me.
- What did he say?
I'll tell you. He said
I was a disappointment, right?
He said I wouldn't be able to stand up for myself, right?
- You're doing the talking.
- No, my father is.
Every time you open your mouth, he's talking. Every thought you think is his.
It's as though he's at my shoulder.
But he didn't always say or think the right thing.
You're gonna find that out when the time comes. Until then leave me alone.
- You want a lift or not?
- Yeah, sure.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Why?
- You've hardly said a word.
- You're right. I've been thinking.
- About us?
- Myself.
That's selfish.
Honey, do you think I'm a brave man?
- What a funny question to ask.
- Well, do you?
I don't know. Why?
- I've got to prove something to someone.
- Who?
You don't know him. He's dead now.
Yes, Pete, I think you're brave.
That helps. You don't know how much that helps.
Let's not talk about it any more.
We should have been talking about ourselves all this time, what's going to happen to us.
- What do you want to happen?
- I want to marry you.
I want that, too.
Funny, we barely know each other.
We see each other for what seems only moments. And yet...
I know what you mean.
- Choynski, not going to the wedding?
- No.
I'd better get a transfer. I can't learn this bayonet business. I'm all thumbs.
- On guard.
- No, Sarge, not again!
- I'm not well from the last time.
- On guard!
- Play that thing again. You lead.
- What?
You lead!
Shift your weight.
Left, left!
There. Keep it up.
You'll get the knack of it.
Practise that about a half an hour every day.
Hey, Sarge! I got it!
I haven't been in church since I was 14.
- Kissing the bride's a great invention.
- Sure makes me homesick.
- What's the matter?
- He looks the same.
- How do you expect him to look?
- Married, wrinkled, worried, like me.
- 44 hours and 34 minutes left. Go!
- Excuse me, sports.
Here's your wedding present from the gang.
You've all been wonderful.
- Are you sure you've got the right guy?
- I'm sure.
Come on, get going!
- "Sempre felice", Mac!
- Keep the situation well in hand, Pete!
We got 44 hours and 33 minutes.
What are we gonna do?
Al, if I was a girl, I'd marry you.
Knock it off! I've had a hard day.
What am I doing?
44 hours and 32 minutes.
That isn't very long, is it?
No, not long at all.
I wonder how many other people have had 44 hours and 32 minutes.
Lots I guess.
- We'll make it seem a long time.
- Years.
- Shall I open it?
- Sure, go ahead.
They're in a hurry!
Others were in a hurry.
The order said move out and the Marines moved out.
11 days at sea. Destination?
Only the top brass knew.
Though, of course, scuttlebutt knew the answer, a hundred answers, all wrong.
Boat Squad... halt, one, two!
Dismissed!
Too bad you couldn't see her again.
You didn't get long.
We knew it might happen.
I'll be back. I've got to believe that.
- Sure. We'll all be back.
- Gangway!
That's no way to carry a flag, Regazzi.
I've got to teach you everything.
Now watch this...
What are you gonna do with this, Benny?
I'm gonna put that up in Tokyo, right in the middle of Times Square.
- There isn't any Times Square in Tokyo.
- There will be when I get there.
Now that's the way to fold a flag, with the blue field showing.
What do you know!
- You got my shirt!
- It's my shirt!
- I'm telling you, it's my shirt!
- It's my shirt!
Here, fellas. You'd better quit fighting so much.
If you don't, one of you's apt to get hurt.
Corpsman! Corpsman!
- What's that?
- Relax. It's the Navy clearing its throat.
Sure don't sound like no squirrel gun.
I hope they practise real good. What island do you think we're aiming at?
We'll get word.
- Here it is.
- It looks like a pork chop.
- What's its name?
- Tarawa.
Never heard of it. It's the wrong place.
It's part of an atoll called Tarawa Atoll.
This particular island is called Betio.
Don't ask me how you spell it.
You'll have to stick your faces into it but you don't have to spell it.
- This is Red Beach Three. That's us.
- What have they got there?
Everything. This island's held by a special naval landing force.
That means Japanese marines.
They're dug in and they're mean.
They'd just as soon die as stick a nickel in a jukebox, but that's all right.
Let the other guy die for his country.
You'll live for yours.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
- Get over there.
- I can hear him.
Get over there. I don't want anybody hurt because you didn't listen.
- Schoolteacher, do me some homework.
- What's your problem, son?
Put down 5,000. Scuttlebutt says that's how many Nips are on that rock.
- The Navy fired 1,000 tons of shells.
- Don't forget the fly-fly boys.
Those B-24s have really been working them over.
Now add the tons of explosives, divide it by the Nips and get the answer.
- Maybe we'll be back for noon chow.
- Don't figure that way.
The Navy and the fly-fly boys unloaded plenty on the canal before we went in.
When we got ashore there were still a lot of those lemon-coloured guys waiting.
Only way that island was taken was by putting marines on the beach.
You've heard the naval foray's a waste of time and metal. Stryker knows better.
- Who cut you in on this conversation?
- You say when I can and can't talk?
- Just when you can't talk to me.
- Knock it off, Conway.
I've had enough of your "hardbitten sergeant" attitude.
You're so big everybody's been afraid to take a punch at you. I'm not!
Cool off!
Forget that pencil and paper routine and worry about staying alive on that beach.
- Don't expect any soft touch!
- "Now hear this"!
All troops report to your debarking stations!
All right, men, sound off when your name's called.
Now hear this, there'll be no movies tonight!
The place is opened up for business.
- Missed!
- Maybe they're firing blanks.
- Maybe a two-headed kid's aiming.
- Maybe this is just manoeuvres.
Get out now. We're crossing the line of departure. Lock and load!
- Good luck, Sarge!
- Charlie, give me a hand here!
Lieutenant, hit the deck! How is it?
I got hit!
Corpsman! You'll be all right.
They got us pinned down!
We can't get over these logs!
- I'm going while I can!
- Stay here, kid!
We're gonna be killed here.
I'd like to get at them!
Why rush? This is a nice place.
- They got the lieutenant!
- They'll get all of us if we don't move.
We are like fish in a barrel lying here.
- Did we train to take it lying down?
- Sarge, do something about it!
Stay where you are until I tell you.
You gotta get us out of here!
If you're nervous count your toes.
I'll do the masterminding around here.
- Where's Lieutenant Baker?
- Machine-gunned.
- Is your squad all right?
- All but one. What's holding us down?
That bunker, an old power plant. All these bombs and they're still killing us.
- Smoke, sir?
- Thanks.
I've sent for flame-throwers to assist.
Your squad will support. Follow me!
You heard! Move out and stay down!
We've gotta silence that bunker!
Request naval gunfire be lifted on target areas, coordinates...
...two-four-six-zero-sugar-tare. Over.
Roger and out.
Flame-throwers out! Demolition in!
Demolition out!
Shipley!
Give me a hand with this pack.
Throw it!
Move out!
Get him out of there!
- There goes one of your nine.
- Now we got tanks.
Better late than never.
Come on!
Corpsman! Corpsman! This way!
Don't wait. They'll find me.
Keep going. Hit 'em for me.
Find Stryker. Stick with him.
He's good people.
Tell him I...
I'd like to know where the rest of the squad went.
- What's this place?
- Whatever it is it ain't healthy!
Let's go!
That was close.
Next time don't be in such a hurry.
- You're across, ain't you?
- Across what? To where?
- I'm running low on ammo.
- I am too.
Forgot about that.
We gotta get some more.
- I'll go.
- Wait! Pick a number from one to six.
- Two.
- Five.
You're both wrong.
That guy kills me.
Thomas better hurry!
- How about some bandoliers, Mac?
- Help yourself.
- How are things going up front?
- Pretty rough.
- Keep it coming.
- Good luck.
- Is that coffee?
- It sure is. Do you want some?
Do I want some, he says!
I haven't had any joe since we left the ship.
You mortarmen sure live the life of Riley here.
Here you are.
Beautiful!
- Where's Thomas?
- Probably dead.
No, not that guy. Let's get out of here!
- Can I have some for my buddies?
- Sure. Break out your canteen.
Tell me, how's everything been going?
Couldn't be better, Mac.
Oh, this is the life!
Come and get it, you guys!
Ammo and fresh hot joe!
Hellenopolis!
Bass!
Hey, Greek!
Hey, Greek!
- What kepts you, Thomas?
- Where's Bass?
Gutted.
No ammo.
What kept you, sports?
Major Crowe, sir.
- Jim? How you doing?
- "It's tough going, Dave".
I've committed every man.
We're dug in and staying.
Good. I've been getting reports all day that the Nips are slipping in to your front.
If it's "banzai" tonight, target area 2-41 is a hot spot.
What outfit have you got there?
Joyce and Stryker.
Pass the word they gotta dig in and stay put.
No noise or movement.
Don't risk anybody unless you have to.
Hold on until we get more men there.
Yes, sir.
Major Crowe says the Nips have been filtering into these tank traps.
Disperse your squad along this section.
Tell your men there's to be no smoking, no moving or unnecessary talking.
If they find out how thin we are, they can get to the beach.
That's a platoon area. All I got's a beat-up squad, short three men.
- Couldn't you...?
- Can I give you three men?
The battalion can't give the whole company three replacements.
Your squad is covering the hottest spot in the line.
If it's an attack tonight they'll strike you first. They want to know our disposition.
I repeat, your men are not to move.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Stryker, we're going to hold this line.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Good luck.
All right, saddle up. Follow me.
Everybody go!
Drop off at intervals, two-man foxholes.
We're gonna be spread out thin tonight.
Don't give away your position or strength.
You Flynns stay here, and no quarrels.
Dunne and Smith, drop out here.
No gab tonight!
You and Harris here! Come on, Conway.
Corpsman!
Listen.
- Corpsman!
- That's a marine.
Corpsman!
- Stryker!
- Get down and stay down!
- You had your orders!
- Somebody's wounded!
- Quiet.
- Let's get him!
Stay down! It may be an old Jap trick.
They pulled it on the canal.
- It doesn't sound like a Jap to me.
- I don't care. You'll tip our position.
Stryker!
It's Bass!
How many Japs know your name?
- You know his voice.
- Shut up.
Aren't you human at all?
A friend of yours may be dying!
Knock it off!
This is what my father taught you.
Be a great marine, be tough.
Sit here if you want. I'm getting him.
The only way you'll stop me is to kill me.
That's just what I'll do!
Stryker!
Stryker!
Sarge!
Stryker!
Please, Sarge!
Tarawa was officially declared secure at 13.30 on the fourth day of battle.
The replacements came ashore, our wounded were cared for and the assault troops were relieved.
- How am I doing, Chaplain?
- God has been good to you.
You're going home.
Per istam Sanctam Unctionem, et suam piisimam, indulgeat tibi Dominus
"quidquid deliquisti. Amen".
Somebody beat me to it.
Skipper gave out some news.
Part of it's good, part of it's bad.
- They found Hellenopolis. He's dead.
- He was a good Greek.
Choynski, Soames and Bass are on a hospital ship Stateside-bound.
- I wish I was with them.
- Let's get cleaned up.
Wash out those dungarees and let's look like marines.
You too, Thomas.
- Dunne.
- Yeah?
I got a couple of bottles of sake in my gear. Give it to the squad.
- Right.
- Tell them you got it off a dead Nip.
Why don't you break down a little?
You got it off a dead Nip.
Aye, aye.
- What's eating you?
- Know what Stryker plans tomorrow?
Another squad problem and I'm so tired of problems!
I'm tired of Stryker!
I'm also tired of beautiful Hawaii.
Me, too.
Hey, champ, what do you think of beautiful Hawaii?
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Clamming up again, ever since Tarawa.
- Why the silence?
- Knock it off!
- Hi! You got room for me?
- What do you know!
- You got time off for good behaviour?
- Yeah.
- Where were you? Pearl Harbor?
- Yeah, nice place. Pretty nurses.
I'll give somebody $5 to shoot me in the foot.
- I'll do it for $2.50.
- You're too willing!
Some replacements out here assigned to our squad.
We build up the joint and they come and live in it.
This is Stein and Fowler and McHugh.
He's Fowler. Mike McHugh, from Cedar
Rapids to see this war's over in a hurry.
- How old are you?
- Nineteen.
- How old?
- Well, eighteen... going on eighteen.
We heard that the squad leader's tough.
- There are rumours to that effect.
- Tough sergeants roll off my knife!
You're gonna find your first few days with Sergeant Stryker very interesting.
You new men come with me.
- Attention!
- Charlie! How are you?
- Certified fit for duty, so the medics say.
- Good.
The replacements came up with me.
They get younger all the time.
- Or we're getting older.
- Or both.
- I can stand having you back.
- I can stand being back.
What happened to the squad, besides the Greek, Shipley and Thomas?
Choynski...
Thomas? He never got a scratch.
- I was sure he got it.
- Why?
When we got stuck in a trench he went back to get ammo. Never came back.
How long between the time he went back and you got overrun?
About 40 minutes.
40 minutes?
Stay here.
Thomas!
- Yeah?
- Outside.
- What's that about?
- Don't ask me. I haven't any spies.
- That's far enough.
- What's this about?
Just that I hate your guts!
Get up.
You doped off and got one of my men killed and one of them bayoneted!
- You haven't had enough. Get up!
- Stryker...
Attention! All right, break it up.
- What's your name?
- Sergeant Stryker. Able Company, sir.
And you?
Pfc Thomas. Able Company, sir.
This may take some explaining before a court martial. Help that man up.
- You'll need medical attention.
- I'll be OK, sir.
That's debatable. You know it's not permissible for an NCO to strike a man?
- Yes, sir.
- Who struck the first blow?
Colonel, there wasn't any first blow struck exactly.
A simultaneous explosion perhaps?
Judo, sir. The sergeant was showing me how to break a judo hold.
No more judo exhibitions.
Understand, Sergeant?
Aye, aye, sir.
At least you're no stool pigeon.
Wait a minute, Stryker.
I'm wrong, dead wrong. I know it.
I doped off for some coffee, but I didn't think a few minutes mattered.
- It did!
- I know that now, but I didn't then.
It's killing me. I can't sleep.
A hundred times I wanted to tell you, tell somebody. I...
I liked that Greek...
I'd do anything for him.
If I could I'd change him for me right now.
I think you would.
Guys make mistakes but every one we make, a stack of chips goes with it.
We make a mistake and some guy don't walk away!
For evermore he don't walk away.
I guess all we can do is just take it...
...and hope we don't make the same mistake again.
I won't.
Let's get back.
Mail call! First Platoon.
A letter from my wife after 18 months.
Know where she is?
In England, entertaining troops.
Entertaining troops? Why isn't she here entertaining me? I'm a troop.
"They're all such nice boys. There's a lieutenant here..." A lieutenant!
When I get back she'll need standing up for a month! I put on muscle lately!
Darling, this is a funny way for a man to find out he's a father, but you are.
It happened the day before yesterday, just in time for breakfast.
He's a boy and looks beautiful like me and intelligent like you.
I should have told you it was going to happen, but I didn't want to worry you.
I don't know what to call him.
We never discussed that.
- I'm a father! Hey, I'm a father!
- Let's see!
- I'm a father!
- All right, let's fall in!
Come on!
Finally we got our leave.
Ten days in Honolulu.
All of us were out on the town.
All except Stryker.
He was still the same.
- Lonesome?
- Drift.
- Whiskey.
- Two?
- Please.
- OK.
Thanks. A drink'll be good. I'm tired.
It's been a rough day...
Knock it off!
I'm sorry, Sergeant.
- Right.
- Thanks.
65 cents for a drink. It's too much.
They cheat servicemen.
We could drink cheaper at my house.
Don't throw your arm out of joint.
Thanks for the drink. I didn't mean to make too much buzzing in your ear.
It's all right, finish your drink.
- I didn't mean to sound so tough.
- I know. You're just unhappy.
Me, too.
My name's Mary.
The long arm of coincidence, or something.
Her name, too.
That invitation still hold?
Make yourself comfortable.
I'll fix us a drink.
Oh, dear!
Well, I can get us some more in a jiffy.
I see.
Will a sawbuck do it?
Go on, take it. It's only paper.
Well, I'll be right back.
- I hope this is your brand.
- Any brand is mine.
- She says she's hungry.
- He.
Advise him against joining the Marines.
Mummy's fixing you something. Her boy'll be quiet while she has company.
Knock it off...
Where's his father?
Gone.
Well, I guess into each life a little rain must fall.
There are a lot tougher ways of making a living than going to war.
You know about babies.
Yeah, I know about babies.
So long, Mac.
- Wait!
- I can't spend it on a coral reef.
- You're a very good man.
- You'll get odds on that in the Marines.
So long.
So long, Sergeant. I'll pray for you.
Let's not get religion.
- I'll pray for you, Sergeant!
- Good luck.
You got a lot of bloodhound in you,
Charlie, but you can call off the dogs.
I'm smarter than I was 30 minutes ago.
Catch me feeling sorry for myself again and you got my permission to belt me in the nose!
- Buy you a drink?
- Lock and load, boy!
- Thanks!
- Two bourbon and ice.
- A baby's a big event.
- Conway!
- Treating the boys?
- Crack open the hatch!
That's great. A fellow always gets more kick out of a boy, I guess.
I got a kid. Sam, I named him...
...after your old man.
Wait till he gets to be ten and doesn't write. You'll be mad enough to hit him.
No, I won't, Stryker, because he won't have to write. I'll be where he is.
And I won't insist that he be tough.
I'll try to make him intelligent.
And I won't insist that he read the Marine
Corps manual. I'll get him Shakespeare.
I don't want him to be a Colonel Conway or Sergeant Stryker.
I want him to be intelligent, considerate, cultured and a gentleman.
- You're out of line, kid.
- Let him be. He has a right to dislike me.
Thanks, and I intend to exercise that right.
- I don't like you, Stryker.
- Let's talk sense for a minute, Conway.
I can't have friction in the squad.
I've tried every approach to you that I know. Got nowhere. You're intelligent...
Don't patronise me. Your opinion of my IQ doesn't interest me in the least.
Let's get this straight.
On duty I jump when you holler.
Off duty I exercise my God-given rights under a democracy and dislike whom I please.
Do we understand each other?
- Beat it.
- Come on, you guys, let's go.
I don't understand why you don't belt him.
- Mellow in my old age, I guess.
- Too bad.
"Screaming Sam" couldn't be proud of him.
He could. There's something inside a guy, always proud of a kid.
- Two more?
- Not for me.
- I'll sail again. One.
- OK.
- Maybe you can steer me home?
- Charge!
Pull pins!
Prepare to throw!
Throw!
- All right, fifth relay!
- What an arm!
Pick it up!
Right in the groove!
- Look, boy, this is a live grenade.
- Gee!
- You know what they can do?
- Yes, sir.
Right hand. Wait for the order to pull pin and pitch grenade.
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.
Ready?
Pull pin!
Prepare to throw!
Throw!
Grenade! Hit the deck!
When will you wake up? You wanna see her again, keep your mind on your work!
- What happened here?
- Little accident, sir.
You're wounded. Corpsman!
- Yes, sir.
- Take care of the sergeant.
Come right over here, Sergeant.
You may not know it, but you just got your life saved.
You'll get a medal.
Again the word came and the Marines moved out.
Again scuttlebutt knew a hundred destinations, all wrong.
This time we were a sound fighting unit, blooded and trained.
Tarawa had blooded us.
Stryker had trained us.
- Now, I'll show you something.
- What you got there?
- What does it look like?
- A flag.
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Occupy this island in the USA's name.
- You think we'll have an easy time?
- You got me with you.
- Maybe we need two of you.
- One was enough in Tarawa.
Stick with me.
I'm a battle-hardened veteran.
Know how many Japs I knocked off in Tarawa? 32. Did I get anything for it?
I got enemies in Washington.
If the Marines didn't have me, they'd never have made it.
Now, this is how you fold a flag!
Do you believe in intuition?
Yeah... in women. Why?
It's hard to explain. I've a feeling
I'm not coming out of this operation.
Don't talk that way.
- I can't help it. It's the way I feel.
- Why?
I don't know. It's like a voice in my ear.
I can't shake the feeling off.
Take my advice, shake it off.
No dice. When things like that get in you, it's no use trying to fight them.
If a marine waits long enough he gets the word.
Our sealed orders came aboard after five days at sea.
This island is volcanic and sandy.
It's five and a half miles long and two and a half miles wide.
This mountain here is a dead volcano. It's called Suribachi.
There's nothing on the island except three airfields and about 20,000 Japs.
The Army Air Corps B-24s have been bombing this place for 62 days.
- Maybe it'll be an easy operation then.
- We can't be sure.
Every yard is covered by some kind of fire.
There are two possible landing beaches, one on the east side, one on the west.
The rest of the coastline is cliffs.
They'll try and keep us off the beaches.
If they don't, they'll try and catch us at this first airfield, between the heights of Suribachi and these high rocky ridges in the north.
They'll shell us from both sides. Nobody knows what they've got on this island.
But they've had 40 years to put it there.
Saipan was our last stop.
The men who were going to hit the beach first transferred to LS Ts.
A few more days at sea and the time for landing came.
Saddle up!
Skip along and into the amtracs.
Anyway, it's a good day for it.
- It's cold.
- Stick around, it'll get warm.
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.
Hey, look!
- Driver, you the joker that wrote that?
- "Semper fi", Mac!
We should take you in along with us.
Hey, McHugh's going in with his pocket full of books! Five books he's got!
So? The kid's a reader.
That shouldn't worry a dope like you.
When we're through with this operation,
I'm gonna break both your legs!
- I feel sick.
- I know. I felt the same way at Tarawa.
Hey, Stein, "Shalom aleychem".
Aleychem shalom.
- Sarge, I'm scared.
- So am I.
- Not you!
- Fowler, I'm always scared.
Line of departure! Get down!
Lock and load! Drop those lifebelts when we hit the beach!
All right, hit the beach!
It ain't Brooklyn!
If this place was a blanket
I'd pull it over my head!
This is the poorest soil I ever saw. What does anyone want an island like this for?
- That's war.
- What's war?
Trading real estate for men.
When God made the world, he must have put all the rubbish left over here.
Corpsman! Corpsman! Take it easy.
Doggone it, almost the same place they got me before!
Getting shot for this!
They're sure pouring it into Suribachi.
Not enough. Those Nips are shooting right down our throats.
- Stryker!
- Yo!
- Lieutenant Shrier wants to see you.
- Lieutenant Shrier?
Stand fast.
- Stryker reporting, sir.
- I know.
Your platoon's been hit hard.
What's left has been assigned to me.
- Yes, sir.
- Naval gunfire lifts at 1100. Stand by.
Aye, aye.
Move out!
Keep your distance!
- Go on, go on!
- Corpsman! Corpsman! Corpsman!
Spread out! Dig in!
- Dunne, where's my brother?
- Back there. He's hit.
Flynn!
That's enough!
I told you you'd need this bad some day. Thanks, Marine.
Flynn! Get down!
- You ain't got the sense of a rabbit!
- You can still be a hero crawling!
- Corpsman!
- Ma'll dust me off if I don't get him back!
Harris!
Well, I'll get a good night's sleep tonight.
Corpsman!
He won't need him.
- Pillbox too big to handle with these.
- A bazooka?
- If we had one.
- I got nothing to do. I'll go pick one up.
Regazzi didn't make it.
You never know what's happening.
Listen.
- It's a tank.
- Yeah, but whose?
Ours!
It's Regazzi.
Pillbox at 2 o'clock.
OK, give 'em a hot foot!
Thanks, Mac.
- I couldn't find a bazooka.
- You did all right. Saddle up!
No one had ever seen anything like it.
No one would have believed it possible.
That smoking, miserable, bloody island.
After three days and three nights, and at the end of that time, we'd barely reached the foot of
Suribachi, where we were the first day.
- We'll sack here for the night.
- Best news today.
Pair off and one man awake at all times.
Keep alert. Let's go.
It'll start getting rough tomorrow against Suribachi.
It started getting rough when you put on that uniform.
You wanna see a good-looking kid?
Husky little boot. What's his name?
We're gonna name him Sam,
Sam Conway.
A name that's been awarded the Navy
Cross is good enough for any kid.
There's something I've been trying to say but... I can't find the words.
Two universities and you can't find the words to say you were out of line?
- OK, I'm out of line.
- No, you were. There's a difference.
We'd better get some sack time.
Wanna sleep first or watch?
- I'll watch.
- OK.
Everybody gets out of line once in a while.
Thanks, gyrene.
Where's Sergeant Stryker?
- Stryker?
- Right there.
- What do you want?
- Lieutenant Shrier wants to see you.
- Stryker, sir.
- Yes, sir.
I'm taking a patrol up Suribachi.
Get your men squared away and be ready at 0700.
- The rendezvous is that Nip tank there.
- Aye, aye, sir, 0700.
That little voice whispering in your ear again?
Don't worry. I've known a million guys that have heard it.
Most of them make it. A few don't.
The percentage is on your side.
- Did you ever hear it?
- No.
- Don't you ever worry about it?
- What good would it do?
- You're indestructible.
- Stick close. It might rub off!
I'll do that.
Banner Three, this is Easy Five. Patrol is ready to move. Request supporting fire.
Ow!
Sh'ma Yisrael, Adonai elohenu...
Adonai echad.
Amen.
Radio!
Banner Three, this is Easy Five. Over.
This is Easy Five. Cease fire, we're preparing to move over the top.
- Roger and out. Stryker!
- Yes, sir.
Colonel's ordered that we put up this flag when the top's secure. Get it there.
Aye, aye, sir.
What is this?
Put yours away.
This is the one we're gonna use.
First squad. Find something we can use as a standard and we'll put this up.
- Conway, you made it.
- I guess that little voice was wrong.
- I feel better.
- I feel better, too.
I never felt so good in my life.
How about a cigarette?
- Is he...?
- Yeah.
If he had to get it it's the way he'd have wanted.
It's a letter to his kid.
"Dear son, I guess none of my letters have reached you.
"I thought I'd try again as I'm feeling
"that this may be the last time I can write you.
"For a long time
I've wanted to tell you many things.
"Now that you're a big boy, I will.
"If we'd been together even for a while,
"I could've explained many things much better than writing them.
"You've gotta take care of your mother, and love her and make her happy.
"Never hurt her or anyone as I did.
"Always do what your heart tells you is right.
"Maybe someone will write you some day and tell you about me.
"I want you to be like me in some things, but not like me in others.
"When you grow older and get to know more about me, you'll see I've failed...
"...in many ways.
"This isn't what I wanted but things just turned out that way.
"If there was only more time I..."
Guess he never finished it.
I'll finish it for him.
There she goes.
All right, saddle up!
Let's get back in the war!
His Excellency, the Reich Protector, will arrive shortly.
What progress have you made,
General Votruba... in your recruiting your Czech anti-Soviet battalion?
- You know the Fuhrer counts on you.
- Yes, but it's extremely difficult... our peasants and workers are, unfortunately very sympathetic to the Russians.
Perhaps our production would increase if our Skoda workers were allowed higher pay... since our food allowance is very low... frequently resulting in exhaustion.
Admittedly, your workers may be under paid as workers... but as an inferior race, as slaves, they are highly over paid.
Give them higher wages, you say?
So they can print more of this underground propaganda?
They distribute this criminal material everyday in the Skoda plant.
Every department is contaminated!
Herr Excellence, the Reich Protector!
His Excellency, the Reich Protector, wishes to say... that the reports from Skoda are a putrid mess.
The stinking swine at Skoda refuse to work.
In Skoda, there are 37,000 workers there.
And the sabotage is out of control ... yet only 50 were executed.
Why not 500?
What did he say?
He said "Shooting only 50 out of 37,000 is ridiculous"... he demands at least 500 lives.
The restrictions mean nothing at all.
Silence!
The munitions factory in Czechoslovakia ... will be put in the hands of the Gestapo.
I personally, will be responsible for Skoda.
If I may, your Excellence... isn't there some better way, something not so drastic...
Is this man crazy ... talking to me in this language?
I insist that all Czech only speak in German. You got that?
German! German! German! German!
I'll teach these sheep at the Skoda factory to obey... not to turn to listen to or obey traitors ever again.
My car!
For those who failed to understand his Excellence's last remarks... the entire Czech armament production ... is now transferred to my authority, under the Gestapo.
The Reich Protector himself will supervise personally... the necessary executions at the Skoda plant.
To Skoda!
Mrs. Dvorak!
- Good morning, Mrs. Novotny.
- Good morning.
I hope I can have 2 lbs. of potatoes.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Novotny, perhaps tomorrow.
The turnips are nice.
Well, I guess it will have to be turnips again, and a nice head of cabbage.
- Why is your motor running?
- Just waiting for my fare.
You know that gasoline is ordered not to waste?
Yeah, but my battery is run down, it won't start up again.
Stop the motor!
Stop the motor!
Now, start it up again.
I... I guess it must have charged up.
So, you carry on this sabotage trick to use up our fuel supply.
- Continue and do not stop.
- I do not know, don't understand it.
- I had to crank it up this morning.
- Drive to the police precinct.
- Yeah, but it never charged up...
- Forward! Forward!
Vanya was arrested.
Get going, quick.
Haya.
Pardon me Miss, but did you see a taxi cab waiting?
Yes, a few minutes ago... but he seemed to had some trouble with the Occupational Police.
They drove off with him.
Thank you.
Go over there.
You, look over there.
Hey, Miss..
A man running out from that alley.
Did you see him?
Yes.
In which direction did he run?
This way!
You better go home, now.
And put it on the book.
Thank you, Mrs. Dvorak.
Identification cards.
One, please.
Heydrich been shot!
Heydrich been shot!
Heydrich shot!
Heydrich been shot!
Stop the film!
Lights on!
Stop the film!
Who started this applause?
Who started it?
Answer me.
No one here applauded.
I demand who started this applause.
The unknown soldier.
Get out your identification cards.
No one is permitted to leave.
You stay here.
No one is permitted to leave.
No one can leave!
- Mister?
- What?
Wait a minute, Anna, what's the hurry?
Bohemia Herald!
New race decree!
Read all about it!
Bohemia Herald!
New race decree!
Who cares? We got the hangman!
State of emergency loitering forbidden, close doors and windows.
No loitering.
State of emergency.
No! No!
- But I'm to stay here.
- No you can't.
But why?
Because of the taxi cab driver's arrest?
I don't know, orders.
But I can't go home. Someone may have recognized me.
- Go to a hotel.
- But they'll check all the hotels
- Where shall I go?
- I can't take you!
I always dreamed of giving a my little girl the most beautiful trousseau...
But with these Germans, all the shops have been scrapped bare.
But mother, I can't imagine anything prettier. And it was yours.
- All it needs is a little cutting down.
- Cutting down?
Now look, Aunt Millie, I suggested it
3 months ago and everyday since.
- Now there is only 2 weeks left.
- Hello, girls.
- Hello father.
- Hello, Stepan.
Helene.
Nothing wrong, Stepan, is there?
No, no, nothing at all.
- Someone shot Heydrich.
- Shot Heydrich? When?
- Where?
- At noon on Kladno Avenue... what we now must call "Ludendorf Street".
It's all in the paper there.
Father.
Yes?
I think I must have seen him.
The man who shot...
Close the door.
- I'm sure I saw him.
- You haven't seen anyone.
- I'm certain I have.
- You haven't seen anyone!
Father, you don't have any connection...
No, monkey, hardly. I've been politically disconnected for over 15 years now.
It's best in such matters, one doesn't talk.
Example: You tell it to A...
A entrust it to B,
B confines in C...
C reposes the secret to D and it's not very far from E or F.
F reports it G and G stands for Gestapo.
Yes, I understand. But to you father...
Listen, come here, come here. Look.
Here.
Definition of "No one"...
"not any, not one, not a single one, none!"
Not to me, not to your mother not to your little brother... not even to your fiance, Jan.
No one is "no one"!
Look, I've had that old battery for 5 years.
Sometimes it works, sometimes it don't.
It's full of quarks!
There is some quarks to the tags, also.
According to the Gestapo, they belong to a car that was burned... last October.
- Is that the late paper?
- Yep.
Can I look at it?
Yep.
Your cab was a getaway car!
I don't know nothing about it.
You will talk to the Gestapo.
Attention!
"By order of the Occupational Police...
"all restaurants, cafes, theaters...
"and public buildings will close immediately.
"Curfew, 7:00 O'clock, sharp.
"After this hour, any person on the street will be shot on sight."
- He must have gotten over the border.
- There are no borders anymore.
The trains are all stopped, the frontier closed.
If he only got out of Prague, that's all I want.
- It looks like they're in a awful sweat.
- You bet.
Excuse me, we have to close now.
Thank you, sir.
There must be some other way than assassination.
What will be the result?
More terror, more bloodshed.
It will be like the student massacre at the university
But Jan, those 120 boys gave their lives to tell the world... that we are still Czech.
That we will always be Czech.
- Yes, I agree on that...
- At least
Shush, Beda.
Say, what is the specific gravity of phosphorus, future brother-in-law?
I haven't the faintest idea.
You've got me there, Beda,
I don't know.
But you're a chemists, you ought to know it by heart.
Well, Jan?
Yes, let me see now... specific...
Uh ah, as a chemists, I only have to know where to look it up.
You have to know it by heart, future brother-in-law.
Jan, you have to hurry if you're to be home before curfew.
Beda, go to the kitchen and tell Auntie to wrap something up for Jan to eat.
With all the restaurants closed tonight, you'll simply starve.
Well, thank you very much Mrs. Novotny.
- I'll say good night then.
- Good night, Jan.
Come.
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow.
Good night, darling.
Good night.
I got your name from the florist across the street.
Mascha, is someone there?
Is nowhere else I can go!
- Mascha.
- Yes, Auntie.
No, no, there's no one.
You helped me once before,
Miss Novotny.
- Yes, but...
- Mascha!
Coming, Auntie.
Come in quick.
In here.
Put your book away, Beda, it's almost dinner time.
Yes, mother.
Hello.
What beautiful roses!
Mascha, aren't you going to introduce me?
Yes, of course. Mister...
- Karel Vanek.
- Won't you please come in, Mr. Vanek?
Come.
Stepan...
Father, I want you to met a friend,
Mr. Vanek.
- Your daughter and I met...
- At the symphony.
My father, Professor Novotny.
- How do you do.
- How do you do.
I had the honor of being introduced to your daughter at intermission.
I had the score of the symphony with me.
Oh, are you a musician, Mr. Vanek?
No, only a amateur.
I happen to be an architect.
I almost went along with
Mascha that evening... only at the last minute,
I don't feel too well.
Oh, that's too bad, but than again...
I wouldn't have had the pleasure of escorting your daughter home.
Oh, then you live in this district,
Mr. Vanek?
No... no, I just happen to be in the neighborhood.
Thought I would drop by and pay my respects.
Young man, did you realize it was already after 7 o'clock?
I have 6:30.
The correct time is 7:15. Your watch must be slow, Mr. Vanek...
And tonight, that might be dangerous.
Yes, I suppose I better run along.
If you're on the street after 7 o'clock, they shoot you on sight.
Right, father...
Dinner is ready, lady.
You mustn't think of leaving.
- Millie, set another place, please.
- Yes.
Luckily Mr. Vanek, we prepared for another guest this evening.
You will join us for dinner, won't you?
I hardly know what to say...
Don't say anything, Mr. Vanek, it's quite unnecessary.
Isn't it, Mascha?
Don't be deceived by this china,
Mr. Vanek.
- Turnips again.
- And cabbage.
My husband likes for me to use this service... just to retain the memory of the good old days.
Let me correct you, Helene.
Not in memory of the good old days... but of the bad new ones.
That is a meat platter.
It contains cabbage.
It should contain meat.
That's why I insist it should be on the table before us.
I agree with you,
Professor Novotny.
What do you think of the shooting of Heydrich, Mr. Vanek?
It was completely unexpected, wasn't it?
It was rather inevitable, don't you think, Mr. Vanek?
Yes.
Well, we're all very glad that he managed to escape.
I'll see who it is.
- It was Mrs. Sacha.
- Our janitor.
All males over the age of 13... must register with the police before tomorrow night.
Anyone without a police card will be shot.
That leaves you out, Beda.
Apparently they don't think much of Czech boys over 11.
Alright. Let them think that.
There may be some news on the radio.
Possibly.
Beda, you can take a recess from that cabbage and turn on the radio.
Yes, sir.
Thanks.
Beda, you have hardly touched your food.
I prefer bread.
Careful, that's an ersatz, it mustn't be...
- Oh, I knew it.
- Poor Beda.
"Fight on, my merry men all...
"I'm a little wounded, but I'm not slain".
It's nothing, I'm all right.
I'll be alright mother.
- I think it will need stitches.
- May I see it, Beda?
- Let's go and, put it under the faucet.
- No, Auntie.
I don't think it will need stitches,
Mrs. Novotny.
If you have a bit of bandage, a little cotton, and some iodine...
- It's bleeding though.
- I think we can stop that.
Alright, Beda.
Can you hold that please? Twist it.
We interrupt our program to give you the latest order...
of the Occupational Authority.
Any person aiding the escape of the assassination or providing him with shelter...
will be executed.
All relatives of such accomplishes...
are subject to the same penalty of death.
The population is hereby warned to report any information...
leading to the assassin at once."
Anyone with holding such information must reckon with the blood debt...
this monstrous crime has laid upon the entire Czech nation...
Those geniuses up there think they can intimidate the Czechs... with public warnings, dopes.
They will need something more concrete to surrender their beloved assassin.
Something to make them jump.
- Czaka!
- What?
Are you listening to me at all?
I beg your pardon?
What are you doing there?
Nothing.
File C. Yes, that's right.
Czaka is spelled with a "C".
Curious, aren't you?
Curious on what the Gestapo may have ... on file on the honorable brewer Czaka.
I will tell you: "His beer is good."
Salute!
But he, himself, rather stinks.
: Right. I hope you're at home this weekend.
- You're a smart ass.
- Don't talk German to me.
If I'm going to police your fascinating people properly...
I have to learn your crazy language to perfection.
Here is the first list, Herr Inspector.
Editor...
Railway worker...
Clergyman.
That's good.
Priest are always good.
They do more harm than anyone else... offending in every sermon.
Listen, I have a good suggestion.
Nykvar, the poet.
Nykvar?
What for?
He is not political.
He only writes folk ballads, children' poems, fables.
Herr Gruber, if it's your intention to
Germanize the protectorate... that is exactly where you should begin, with the children.
You're an extraordinary patriot, Czaka.
I'm sorry, professor... do you think I might ask the janitoress if there is an available room here... in the house where I might stay over?
I happen to know there's nothing.
There is an available couch in my study...
That I can personally assure you is not uncomfortable.
It has already been made up.
You're welcomed to it.
Very kind of you, but...
There is hardly an alternative, is there Mr. Vanek?
I hope those chimes don't keep you awake.
Wenceslas hymn?
I should be use to it.
I hear it every morning.
What funny times. A man meets my daughter at a symphony concert once ... and the next week he moves in.
Do you think the neighbors might gossip?
What of Jan?
- I don't see why the neighbors should hear of it at all.
- Well, the janitoress knows.
She does?
Yes.
Who told her?
We have our breakfast quite early,
Mr. Vanek.
Since it's forbidden to lecture at the university any longer... some of my former students come here to continue their studies.
-  Good night, monkey.
- Professor, I must speak with you.
You have to excuse me. and a old fellow like me can't keep up with you younger men.
Good night, Mr. Vanek,
I hope you rest well.
Good night, monkey.
Good night, father.
You don't need to tell him anything, he knows.
You told him?
I tried to tell him, but he wouldn't let me.
Father is an old revolutionary.
He was in exiled with the founders of the Republic.
British broadcasting...
The Czech government in exile here informs that the daring execution...
of the hangman Heydrich is expected to be followed by a nationwide bloodbath...
as savage as only the
Nazi barbarians can be.
This woman who lead our men the wrong way... must have brought vegetables at your place many times before.
Maybe, but I don't know her name.
Pick it up, again.
There, put it back in place.
Good.
You say you never learned where the girl lives?
- No.
- Here is the coffee, Herr Ritter.
Thank you very much.
Real coffee.
Now, Mrs. Dvorak, let's start from the beginning.
Now, don't be nervous, Mrs. Dvorak.
I am prepared to devote to you all of tonight... even longer, if necessary.
Well?
That's the girl.
I want you to listen to me very closely,
Mrs. Dvorak.
Do you realize where you are?
Yes.
And exactly, where are you?
Gestapo.
And you actually believe you will walk out of here without telling us the truth?
Now.
This girl... who sent our men the wrong way... she must have brought vegetables at your place many times before.
It is now 8 a.m.
Last night the Fuhrer's own physician...
performed an extremely delicate operation on the spinal cord...
on his excellency the Reich Protector...
removing 3 pistol bullets.
- Anything?
- No. Nothing yet.
Here.
Several people have been arrested.
It is reliably reported that the
Gestapo have a definite clue...
- that will lead directly to the assassin.
- The taxi driver.
- No, no.
- But, who else?
I don't know.
I must leave at once.
An important announcement from the Occupational Authorities.
Taking personal charge...
the chief of the Gestapo from Prague...
Kurt Haas, has ordered instant retaliation...
for the insufficient cooperation of the civilian population.
Most severe methods are to be expected.
They know nothing.
If they did, they would not threaten.
Miss Novotny.
Open up!
Come with me. You, stay here.
Who are you?
What's your name?
- Karel Vanek.
- You live in this house?
Who are you?
I am Professor Novotny.
Whom are you looking for?
- For you!
- No!
Quiet, no interference!
On what grounds?
For the loathsome abominable crime committed  against.. the person of the
Reich Protector. And the refusal... of Czechs who resist to cooperate with us.
Who shall be held hostage until the killer... is delivered to the authority.
And what if he is not surrendered?
This response is from the Occupation Authority.
If I understand you correctly, and for the benefit of my family and students... the loathsome abominable crime... comitted against his excellency, the Reich Protector... or more correctly, the unheard of... traitorous behavior of my countrymen... in failing to cooperate wholeheartedly with their "German protectors"... compels you to hold me hostage... together with others in whom, I presume, until the assassin is surrendered.. our lives becoming forfeit for his?
- I believe that is correct?
- Correct
- Father, no. They can't...
- Oh yes, they can.
They can arrest me, they can arrest a hundred more.
Indeed, they can arrest as many hundreds as they have on their lists.
But I don't believe they will find one single traitor among us.
- Or in all of the Czech nation.
- Who are you and all these others?
Some of my former students.
I give them private tutoring.
Or is that forbidden too?
Keep your mouth shut, or you'll get some real tutoring. Make yourself ready.
How can you take my husband for something he knows nothing about?
No interruptions!
- Ludmilla.
- Yes?
Will you get some of my things ready?
Just a few for tonight.
Yes.
No razors are permitted.
I trust you will all continue with your studies?
Don't let yourself be snowed under at Valley Forge.
Father!
Good luck.
- Thank you.
- Now please go.
All of you.
- Stepan, I'm frighten.
- I know, I know
Monkey.
Thank you, sister.
Goodbye, son.
Remember all this, well.
I will.
I'm ready.
Vystyd, Priest
Votruba, General.
Pravotka, Jew.
Necval, Writer.
Schyler, Clerk.
Matouseck, Worker.
Attention!
Who is the oldest?
All men over 50 raise your arms.
You, your name.
Professor Stepan Novotny.
Stand at attention when you address me!
Novotny, you're in charge of this barracks.
Will be completely responsible for compliance with camp regulations.
Base cleanliness must be maintained.
No spit or dirt on the floor.
All shoe laces, suspenders, neck ties, and belts... must be turned into to the commandant's office within one hour.
Understood?
Don't shake your head, speak!
Father should have dressed more warmly.
Because it is damp and cold out there.
The assassin must give himself up, or he's a monster.
If I knew who he was,
I'd go out and tell the police.
- Anyone in Prague should.
- Aunt Millie, it's not as simple as that.
- Why not?
- Whoever help him... can't go to the Gestapo after last nights broadcast
It would be like signing his own death warrant. Him and his whole family.
Any one who knows... and helps him, is as guilty as the assassin.
Mascha!
Jan, look after Mascha.
Mascha, is there something I can do?
There is only one hope... that he gives himself up.
Yes, I'm afraid so.
Oh darling, I'm sorry, but ...
I have to get back to the lab.
Yes.
Funny, when I left you last night...
I met a chap coming up the stairs with some red roses.
Oh yes, the florist sent them to my mother.
She is one of his old customers.
I'll see who it is.
- Beda!
- They called off the school for the whole week.
They said on account of Heydrich...
But I heard they are using the rooms for the wounded from Russian battles.
- How about father?
- Nothing yet.
Mascha, if you hear anything be sure to let me know.
- I will, Jan, and goodbye darling.
- Good bye.
- Good bye, Jan.
- Good bye, Beda.
- Beda, your bandage is all filthy.
- It isn't filthy, it's just a little tangled.
- I'll fix it.
- No, I better do it. Come with me.
You ought to take lessons from Mr. Vanek.
He's an expert at bandaging.
You're next, Mr. Dedic.
Good afternoon, doctor.
Good afternoon.
His case history, doctor.
How's everything going?
Yesterday I was afraid of complications, but today it's been pretty good.
- Here are the bandages, doctor.
- Thank you. That's all.
I took two sedatives.
Look at that
Naturally, anyone who has been through your last 24 hrs
Yesterday, when Vanya was arrested, it looked pretty serious
So we had to leave you on your own.
- I understood.
- You did a great job, Svoboda.
Now they let lose their horrible bloodbath.
Yes.
They've already sized over 400 hostages.
We anticipated hostages.
Yes.
Yes, we did, didn't we?
I spent last night with the family of Professor Novotny, the historian.
No...
No previous acquaintance.
His daughter helped me.
She directed the black shirts the wrong way.
This morning...
Dedic...
I've decided to give myself up.
- Svoboda!
- Oh, I'm not trying to make any noble gestures.
Or become a heroic martyr...
But 400 lives...
Four hundred?
Dedic, I'm only one, only one.
Have you thought about what must be done to drive the Germans out?
You'll be needed, Svoboda.
You have no right to surrender.
Don't worry...
They won't torture any information out of me.
All they'll get is my dead body... a written confession and the evidence.
The bullets they remove from Heydrich will give them that.
The gun will be absolute proof.
No... the underground has nothing to fear.
But it has, Svoboda.
Listen, you're an physician.
If a man showing your symptoms came into your clinic... wouldn't you diagnose his case as nerves shot to pieces... hysteria cause by exhaustion?
Would you advise a patient in that state... to make an irrevocable decision?
You would not!
Svoboda, you were chosen to act as a representative of the Czech people.
The Czech people have executed "the Hangman".
400 lives! Yes, Svoboda,
What is 400 lives?
This is a war of millions... and the execution of Heydrich is only one battle in that war.
But a most important one.
And if you surrender yourself, alive or dead...
The Czech people will have lost that battle.
Every Czech person will say to themselves:
"We dare not resist!"
"The Nazi terrorist is too much for us!"
Svoboda... three years ago we lost our army.
We stood on the streets crying like children and watched it surrender.
So we built a new one...
A ghost army that will haunt them until their blood runs cold!
Now, you would have this army surrender too?
What about this Novotny family?
I take it you were sufficiently cautious?
They know nothing of me.
I used the name of Vanek, told them I was an architect.
You're sure you didn't leave no clues to your real identity...
- positive connecting link?
- None, I'm sure.
Dedic... what about the taxi driver?
Jumped out of the window at the
Gestapo. They got nothing from him
I never met the man.
I wish I had.
You better let me have that gun.
You have a fool proof alibi... but with that gun and those bullets there, they would chew that apart.
One moment.
You forgot your prescription.
Miss Novotny.
Dr. Svoboda, may I talk to you alone?
Nurse, please.
What are you going to do?
How did you happen to find me?
That's not important.
It was Beda, it was your bandage that gave me the idea you were a physician.
You said you hear the
Wenceslau hymn every morning.
So, when I noticed this hospital across from the church...
- What are you going to do?
- Nothing.
Nothing?
Last night you spoke differently... when it was your life in danger.
Now you think you're safe.
So now it's nothing, nothing to be done?
Dr. Svoboda, you're the only one who can save my father.
What are you going to do?
I can not surrender to the Germans, if that is what you mean.
But they will kill him for what you did!
- Let me explain.
- Alright, explain.
Explain why the man who helped you was taken away to his death... while you stood there silent.
But don't think I will be silent,
I tell you, I won't!
I won't let you kill my father, because I won't!
Miss Novotny, consider what possible benefit... it could do your father, for whom I have the deepest admiration... if you denounce me.
- You would involve your entire family.
- You were counting on that, weren't you?
You think you have control over me because we helped you.
This is not a threat, but a simple fact.
One you must not forget.
You have it all nicely worked out.
If I tell them, then all my family will be shot.
If I keep silent, only my father will be shot.
In other words, you simple statement of fact is... we are lost in any case because we were generous enough to save your life.
You're just a cold blooded coward.
You are no better than Heydrich, himself.
Even the Gestapo couldn't be as inhuman as you are!
- Petschek Bank.
- Gestapo headquarters?
- Yes, quickly.
- Yes, ma'am.
Hurry, please.
Driver!
Driver!
Driver!
Driver! Can't you hear me?
You're going the wrong way.
Stop!
- Who are you?
- Miss Novotny, you must be out of your mind.
- Do you know what you're doing at all?
- Stop, driver.
I have no time now to give you a lecture on political principles.
Haven't you any idea what is going on here?
- This is war, and you're in it.
- Who are you, and where are you taking me too?
Don't be frightened, we aren't taking you anywhere.
We just want to explain to you...
- Help, let me out please!
- What going on here?
This driver took me the wrong way here, but I told him...
- Where do you want to go, Miss?
- To the Gestapo.
Gestapo?
But he drove the other way... then this strange man...
Strange man?
Where is he?
I don't know what she is talking about, so help me.
I didn't hear the little lady at all.
I'm hard of hearing... getting pushed around by the tweezers.
Alright, you're blocking traffic, you better keep moving.
Why did you want to go to the Gestapo?
Did they send for you?
- Com'on baby, tell us.
- Com'on, out with it.
No, No...
Well, if they didn't send for you, what business have you got with those butchers?
What does a decent Czech girl want with the Gestapo anyway?
Who are you squealing on you little Judas? That poor driver?
What did he do to you, huh?
The Gestapo!
- No, don't let them.
- You needn't be afraid, Miss
- You wanted to be taken to the Gestapo?
- Yes.
Have you received a summons, or do you wish to make a statement?
I haven't received any summons.
Alright miss, you will be taken to the headquarters safely.
Mascha Novotny, for Inspector Ritter.
Here is your pass, Miss Novotny.
Heil, Hitler.
Miss Novotny, it will be a few minutes.
Perhaps I might go to the washroom?
My cheek is bleeding again.
Right across the corridor, first door to the left.
Your pass, miss??
Over there.
Your pass?
You've been to Herr Ritter's office?
- Yes.
- And you have already made your statement?
Yes.
That's strange.
That pass should be signed and stamped.
- There must have been should kind of mistake.
- We don't make mistakes here!
My father had nothing to do with the shooting yesterday.
He was doing research at the library all day.
You can easily get proof.
- And this is the statement you came to make?
- Yes.
But I understood only a few minutes ago... you wanted to leave... without the benefit of this extremely valuable testimony.
We are very grateful to you... for not leaving us.
Just wait a minute.
First she tried to break out without seeing me.
Now she would have us believe she came only to have her father released.
- Bunk!
- What does she look like?
Young, quite attractive... brown eyes, about 22, I would say.
Burnett, 5ft 4?
Yes!
I'm sorry to keep you waiting so long,
Miss Novotny.
It's too bad for us, you see.
Before you explained about your father...
I honestly hoped you came ... because of the one million marks reward.
Can you appreciate my disappointment?
Come here, Mrs. Dvorak.
Come, come, come.
Wait over here
Is this the girl who sent the our men the wrong way?
You don't know her at all?
Yes, I know her.
- She is Miss Novotny.
- Did she come to your shop at noon yesterday?
No.
You know what will happen to you if you lie?
Yes.
Take her!
Marvelous people, these Czechs.
Stubborn to the end.
To the bitter end...
Miss Novotny.
Get me Inspector Gruber.
I'm glad you're not involved in this beastly crime.
Hello?
No, Herr Gruber.
Don't question her anymore.
Make her feel safe.
She is our only good lead, so far.
Tell her you'll let her go... but hold her here, some excuse... typing the record or something.
Long enough for us to work.
Attention!
Attention!
Barrack leader
Novotny. 42 men.
Form into straight lines.
Stand up, all of you!
Form up! Faster!
As you stand!
What's your name?
Vasily.
Vasily.
What does this mean?
- Name?
- Santroch.
No, Herr Inspector.
Nothing.
Here is your report.
Your statement and incident on the streets.
Sign it.
In exactly 30 minutes... the first 40 hostages will be executed.
Sign all four copies.
By the way, your father is not among the 40... this morning.
You are free to leave now,
Miss Novotny.
Heil, Hitler.
Mascha, I didn't lose my head at all... even when they found out about your friend sleeping here the night before last
Aunt Millie!
Don't worry, I stopped all chance of gossip.
Nip it in the bud. I told them it was your fiance who stayed over, Jan.
Jan!
- Jan, darling I must talk to you.
- I must talk to you too.
- Where have you been?
- We better go inside.
I'll tell you where I've been: at the Gestapo since 6:00 this morning.
What did they ask you about, Jan?
They wanted to know where
I spent last night.
- And?
- I told them I was here, of course!
- Of course.
- Mascha, what is this all about? Who is this man?
- What did they ask about him?
- O Inspector Gruber questioned me... wanted to know if I knew him.
How did he happen to come to your house?
- He dropped in just after you left.
- To see your Father?
- Was it something political?
- No, nothing political.
He came to see me.
You?
You see, we met at the symphony last week... yesterday he...
- dropped in quite unexpectedly.
- And stayed for the night.
It was curfew hour.
He had to stay over.
Charming coincidence.
He was the man who brought you those roses, wasn't he?
Yes.
"The florist sent them to my mother".
That was a lie too.
Jan, You don't think I... had anything to do with that man?
Mascha, I always thought that everything between us would be above board...
Open, clean.
Darling, you know I love you.
Please try to believe in me, Jan.
Mascha, why didn't you tell me?
Don't ask me why.
If you love me, Jan, you must believe in me.
You're all I have to believe in.
You know that.
Don't let me down.
Jan, I'll never forget that you believed in me.
Miss Novotny?
Gestapo. You're under arrest.
We checked your story,
Miss Novotny...
In all of Prague, no architect called Vanek exists
You're lying.
Where did you say you met him first?
At symphony hall.
You said you met him during the intermission?
No, he had the seat next to mine.
And he told you his name was Vanek?
Yes, Karel Vanek.
- What's his real name?
- I don't know.
What illegal organizations does your daughter belong too?
None at all. Mascha is a music student.
This Karel Vanek...
Isn't he one of your husbands former colleagues from the university?
A fellow teacher?
- Professor Novotny had never met him before.
- Where does this man live?
How shall I know?
He didn't tell me.
Is it usual for your niece to entertain strange gentlemen at night?
No.
How many times did he sleep over at your apartment?
Only that night.
And on the account of curfew.
Why did he come that particular night?
- I don't know.
- Answer properly!
You know we have means to make you talk.
Maybe you have heard about the rooms below.
What was his exact reason for coming?
A former call, to pay respects to my daughter is all.
Why did you sister-in-law say it was your daughters fiance?
Because I was afraid the neighbors would gossip about a stranger.
What was this "stranger"'s real name?
- Mr. Vanek.
- You're lying!
- I'm not lying.
- No?
We'll soon find out.
Do you know where your sister is right now at this moment?
She is where everybody ends up who doesn't tell us the truth!
Mrs. Dvorak!
The whole family sticks to the same story...
But I don't believe this man,
Karel Vanek, exists
This letter arrived at the Novotny apartment half an hour ago... by special messenger with a bouquet of roses... from a  "Mr. Karel Vanek".
Vanek!
Interesting.
Why, this is ridicules!
You told me that this man doesn't exists
Curios.
He doesn't exist, yet here he is.
You're not going to tell me we went through all this trouble for a silly love affair?
Looks that way.
What do you suggest, Gruber?
That we release the girl.
- What?
- What else can we do?
Are we suppose to interfere with lovers?
Or are we?
Miss Mascha, I had to come and offer all my sympathy to you and your mother ... for your father's arrest.
I have been unable to get that tragic scene out of my mind.
Ever since yesterday morning, I've been in the depths of despair trying to quiet my conscience.
- I came to offer my help.
- Help!
You're talking of help!
The one responsible for all we have been through!
You spent the night with your conscience brother you?
We spent it with the Gestapo!
My whole family is still there.
You're the one the Gestapo wants!
You killed...
any feelings I...
ever had for you.
The things we've been through merrily because you spent the night here...
- Mr. Vanek.
- Mascha...
I can't tell you how sorry I am... that my thoughtlessness has brought to you.
Whatever you think of me,
I deserve and more.
Tell me the truth!
Alright, Mascha, I will.
I gave you a false name.
My name is not Karel Vanek, and I'm not an architect.
I am Dr. Franticek Svoboda...
resident surgeon at St. Pancrazio hospital .
Why didn't you tell me that right away?
Maybe we ought to go into the living room.
- Out here we might be overheard..
Mascha, I must make an confession.
I love you.
I did take advantage of the curfew law to stay over night...
But now it seems my silly little escapade has boomeranged...
And I have fallen head over heels with you Mascha.
And that is my only excuse for the trouble I've made you.
I think I understand you much better now,
Dr. Svoboda.
And you do forgive me?
I really ought to blame myself. After all...
- Shut it down!
- Well...
This puts us right back to where we started.
There is something fishy about all of this.
Why can't we admit when we are through?
You've have wasted all our time over a cheap romance.
Release the family, start from scratch... before Berlin comes down on our necks.
They're lovers.
Maybe.
I remember exactly, because it was the same day his Excellency was shot.
- You're sure of the time?
- I have the operation reports right here.
Dr. Svoboda assisted me while I performed the Cholecystectomy.
During the operation he was in charge of the suction pump apparatus as usual.
Dr. Kesselbach, I understand you also function as physician ... for storm troop 34.
Yes, sir.
And Dr. Svoboda was there that day, throughout the operation?
Yes, for 42 hours.
He stood only a few feet away from me.
You understand, Herr Inspector, these intestinal operations...
- require constant control...
- I understand, Dr. Kesselbach, Thank you.
That's all I wanted to know.
Thank you, professor.
Heil, Hitler!
Heil, Hitler!
Frankly, I dislike being beaten.
Even by our most distinguish poet.
You know, Mr. Necval, I always wanted to met your personally...
- and now at last..
- I had always hoped to met you, Professor Novotny.
- and now at last..
- Excuse me, Mr. Necval...
- I wonder if I could bother you?
- Yes?
I happen to just scribble something down today just to... a few lines for a song maybe.
You being such a big writer,
I thought if you have the time... please look it over. Fix it up a bit?
My friend, I have all the time in the world here... until these who'eses...
Well, this is a scribble.
Here, you better read it to me.
"Fellow patriots, the time has come.
Fellow patriots, there is work to be done.
Raise the invisible torch and pass it along...
Keep it burning, keep it forward on the road that has no turning.
Die if you must, for a cause that's just.. but shout to the end:
'No Surrender'.
Ever onward, no returning... the senseless butcher will be learning... that this war isn't won until the last battle is done.
Carry on, when we are gone.
No surrender!"
Of course you could made that a lot better.
No, my friend... let's have it just as it stands.
How does it go again?
"Fellow patriots..." Let me see that please?
"The time has come.
Fellow patriots, there's work to be done.
Raise the invisible torch and pass it along...
Keep it burning...
Keep it burning, forward on the road that has no turning.
Die if you must, for a cause that's just.. but shout to the end:...
'No surrender!'."
So we must answer to terror with terror
theirs  is the murder of hostages...
Ours is the slowing down of the German war machine.
By the end of the week all war production must be lowered by a full 25%.
I work in the office of a former hardware factory.
Now making parts for heavy tanks.
A few days ago, a telegram came in from Berlin... to stop immediately the manufacture of 5 special tank parts.
Because the new model tanks they have started making for the Russian front.
Luckily, I saw the telegram before anyone else saw it.
So I tore it up and threw it in the stove.
But what will happen?
They'll go on making the same 5 parts.
But when we send them to Germany... they won't fit the new tanks.
Emil?
I think you all know sufficiently... by my work with this group in the past.. that no sacrifice has been too great for me.
Yet I tremble before the bloodshed... that threaten so many innocent victims.
850 hostages have been arrested by now.
More than 250 are already dead.
The very flower of our Czech nation...
faces systematic annihilation.
Scientists, leaders of commerce and industry, artists... even priests of God!
So I ask, regardless of sentiment...
Can our nation afford the loss of these outstanding citizens?
I say to myself, again, and again... this man, whoever he is... whoever executed "the Hangman", is a great patriot... a hero!
But still, I can't help myself...
I keep thinking: "If this man would surrender himself...
If he would say: 'Here I am, do with me what you will, but spare the innocent'"...
Wouldn't that be better for our beloved country?
So I ask our group here, if it should agree with me... to move to submit my proposal to the Central Committee.
Already people are saying... it is sheer lunacy to sacrifice hundreds of lives for one.
Emil, where did you hear people saying such things?
All over Prague.
I've even heard people blaming the underground... for this new wave of German terror.
Not where I work, and I keep my ears open.
- Right.
- I've listened to many women... some of them wives and mothers of hostages.
Not one of them spoke a single word against this.
I'm absolutely against the motion.
I must ask to be excused on voting on this matter.
My older brother was one of the hostages executed this morning
All those in favor, raise their hands.
Now the "nays"?
I think the "nays" have it.
We have to adjourn now, it's getting near curfew.
Leave one by one at irregular intervals.
Dr. Pillar, is any one in your group... know anything about you except your first name?
Only the leader, Bartos.
Anyway, you better not attend any further meetings.
You're the only one in this group involved in the Heydrich affair.
Anyone who was involved should have severed connection with this group.
I understand.
Bartos, I just told the doctor here not to attend ... any meetings of your group until further notice.
Dr. Pillar, use the stairs, please.
I think this group will have to be dissolved immediately.
I know exactly what you're thinking.
That peculiar motion.
- You know this man well?
- Certainly.
He's been with us 2 years, contribute a lot of money.
How does he function in your group?
He uses our beer wagons to distribute our leaflets.
He's the big brewer, Czaka, Emil Czaka.
Remember 2 years ago when that group in Pilsen, was betrayed to the Gestapo...
- and 12 were executed?
- The Pilsen raid.
Yes, I know.
Czaka was suspected for a while.
But it was established that the traitor spoke perfect German... and a very thorough investigation proved that Czaka... doesn't speak a bit of German.
You think I put myself in danger?
In all probability you talked yourself into kingdom come.
But you suggested it.
I suggested you feel out the grounds, test their morale.
I didn't suggest you crawl out on a limb and saw yourself off.
- Take some cheese, it's good.
- No I have no more appetite.
Maybe... maybe it would be safer if I left town?
Sorry sir, once you work for the Gestapo... you work for the Gestapo.
Then I insist you give me a special body guard.
I will not do anything without it.
You'll do everything,
... and like it.
Herr Gruber, how can you treat me like this?
I've done so much for you all these years, and for Germany!
And why did you do so much for us,
Czaka?
Because as a real Czech patriot
I realize our entire future... depends on unconditional collaboration with greater Germany.
And I thought you did it for business reasons.
For certain favors... for certain very profitable military contracts.
May I?
- Nice gold lighter.
- You like it?
You wouldn't think of bribing me... with a gold lighter.
Czaka, Czaka, Czaka...
Suppose I pay you for police protection?
Oh, just like life insurance?
How much of a premium would you be willing to pay?
How much do you want?
2,000 marks.
2,000 marks per week?
Per day.
2,000 marks per day?
Only a few days until we round up your friends... then you just drop the insurance.
Say 5 days,
10,000 marks.
Suppose it lasts a month?
So what? Another 50,000 marks.
Why Czaka, you are a big beer magnat.
Just another drop in the barrel.
Make that check payable to the treasurer of the Occupational Police Fund.
That's it, Czaka.
I am the treasurer.
I know.
- Yes?
- Your Father will be executed... at 6:00 this morning. You will be allowed to see him before he is taken away.
In a half an hour the police car will take you to the camp. That's all.
You have ten minutes, no more.
Monkey.
Yesterday I was questioned about that gentleman who visited us.
Me too, but everything turned out all right.
He came back to apologize... and offered me any help we might need.
That's good.
How is mother and Ludmilla? and Beda, how is he?
Mother tried to see you.
I was permitted to write her a letter.
I think the censor will let it through.
It was only personal.
I also started a letter to Beda...
I was sure it would not pass.
I'll tell it to you, Mascha, and you repeat it to him.
What I now want to say to you my son... is meant for you when you are a grown man... the now mighty invaders... will now have been thrown off our land for quite some time.
"Quite some time."
I hope you will be living in a free land... where the people are truly governed by themselves and for themselves.
Those will be great days to live.
"Those will be great days to live."
In a land where all the men, women, and children will have enough good food to eat.
And time to read, and to think... and to talk things over with one another for their own good.
When such great days do come... don't forget that freedom is not something one possesses... like a hat or piece of candy.
The real thing is fighting for freedom.
And you might remember me... not because I've been your Father... but because...
I also died in this great fight.
"Because I also died... in this great fight."
Time is up, Novotny!
Attention.
Let's go!
He still has his life in your hands.
Who was the man you helped escape... when you sent our men the wrong way?
I tell you I sat on that investigating committee myself... and Czaka was entirely clear of that raid in Pilsen.
Because the traitor spoke German and Czaka doesn't...?
Yes.
Yet when he came to Prague and brought his brewery... he paid with a Deutsche check from the Bank of Berlin... according to a little research of my own.
Maybe Czaka does understand German.
Listen, I've got an idea.
It might work now after these 2 years.
I don't know, but we can try.
What?
We can use Rudy for this.
Hello, Beda.
Father was shot this morning.
Shot?
But I...
- Mascha!
- Jan, will you come with me please?
I'm going to the camp to claim his body.
But Mascha here is a list of all those who were executed this morning.
Your father's name is not among them.
See here, under the N's.
Only 4, Navitol,
Napitol, Naavi and Nimocek.
But I saw him on the truck this morning ...
Yes, Miss Novotny?
Oh, your Father.
No, that list is correct.
No. Just a little mistake.
You were right, Jan.
Mother! Mother!
They play with human beings like a cat with a mouse.
I don't care.
I don't care!
As long as he is alive.
- Yes?
- Bartos just called me to met him for lunch.
A sort of informal meeting.
What shall I do?
Go!
What?
Listen, I'll arrest him when I see fit, not before.
What about these two that you still only know by their first names?
But they will kill me!
Alright, you'll have your police guard.
Where do you want them, and when?
Back room...
Cafe Kramer.
Mr. Emil.
- Well, Emil.
- Emil!
I want you to met my Uncle,
Mr. Dedic, just in from Kladno.
- You're having lunch with us?
- Yes, I only have time for a quick bite... before I catch my train to Karlsbad.
Passing through I thought I would say hello to my nephew.
Well, my pleasure, sir.
Won't you be seated?
Uncle.
Matushka.
Emil.
Ladies and gentlemen, just between ourselves...
I don't recommend the goulash, but the paprica liver... simply prewar!
And speaking of food, or rather "No food"...
I heard the most wonderful Hitler story yesterday. You understand German?
- Yes.
- Yes.
You have to excuse me, I can only tell it in
German or I'll ruin the whole joke.
Well, I know a little school book German.
That is if you want me to hear it!
- Of course.
- Sure you'll translate for us, Matushka.
Goebbels comes to Hitler...
"Adolf, we have food for 5 years."
"Five years? Really?" Said the Fuhrer.
"Yes, five years," Goebbels said.
And the Fuhrer said...
"I must tell Herman Goring"
"No, by God," replies Goebbels.
"Do not tell Herman.
It's just the two of us, you and me."
I happen to remember another Hitler joke.
Hitler said to one of his elite guards...
I forget how it goes.
Yesterday you showed a very good memory... for the teachings of your Gestapo friends... when you tried to convince us that we should surrender the man who shot Heydrich.
So, you don't understand German, you slimy scum?
No, I don't. I swear!
Drag him back, keep him quiet.
Here, help me, police!
Get out! Through the window!
Help, police!
- Let's get out of the kitchen.
- Go ahead, we'll cover you!
Halt! Put your hands up!
Friends, I am Jan Pestuca, editor of the "Prague Evening News"...
and I have been requested to speak to each barracks.
At 5 O'clock, we hostages...
will be given the opportunity to address all of Czechoslovakia...
for a full hour's broadcast
Each barracks will be represented by 2 or 3 volunteers... who will speak of the necessary of the immediate surrender of the assassin.
Volunteer speakers must be ready at 4:30 sharp.
Attention!
It's clear as daylight... they're trying to use us as a cat's paw to get the assassin for them.
I say, let the Czech people decide.
Our lives, or the assassin's.
I hope there will be no such volunteering in here.
What else is there to do?
It's not only a question of saving the 300 of us still alive.
But after we're shot, what then?... there will be another 300, then 3,000.
There will be no end until they get the assassin.
There will be no end anyway, and they never needed a beginning.
They slaughtered thousands long before Heydrich.
Just for breathing Czech air.
Has it ever occurred to you professor that the assassin is letting us pay for his act...
While he goes scot free?
He, and his underground pals.
I don't intent to wast my time with you here.
What we want is the identity of this man, Dedic.
Aldrich Krapke, the engineer?
- Yes.
- As an educated man... surely you are intelligent enough to see the unpleasant experiences ahead of you.
You understand, Aldrich... when Herr Gruber says "unpleasant"... he's merely being polite.
What's he doing here?
He belongs here, Gestapo informer.
I don't get it.
You'll get it soon enough... right through your head just before we knock it off.
Why, you stinking fat crawling scum, you!
You shut your mouth you filthy Bolshevik traitor!
- Sabotador...
- Chega!
You don't have to prove to us that you're not one of them.
Katerina Honiga, private secretary.
You sabotaged your factory very cleverly.
Perhaps you are... clever enough not to want to visit our vault downstairs?
Perhaps you prefer to talk to me... in private.
No, I can tell you right here what I think of you.
- You pig.
Yes, you better not see her alone... you stool pigeon, or she'll scratch your eyes out, you fascist blood hound.
Big talk. Ten minutes down below and you'll beg them to kill you.
Your mothers use to lay with rats! their milk was sewage.
Take them to the vaults.
All of them!
Tell them I want to know about this Dedic.
- Down there!
- Take them!
Are these all the volunteer speakers you have?
Commandant, barracks 2 and 3 failed to produce anyone who volunteered.
Herr Commandant, in our barrack #5, they also tried to prevent us...
Quiet. Be ready to began your speeches in exactly 2 minutes
Yes sir, I just have another idea to jot down for my speech.
That is not necessary.
Here are your speeches.
We must climb the path to loyal collaboration...
and our very first step must be to surrender the assassin.
Just plain common sense.
I was always against using force.
Not one of us would hesitate to die for the true welfare of our nation.
But people of Prague,
I ask you... shall we perish for the vicious act of a murdering manic?
Stop that immediately!
It's easy for you to talk.
You're not gonna be shot!
- Everyone sit down!
- Be quiet!
The Germans have succeeded, in part in shattering the unity of the city.
Many people are now using the word "assassin"... whereas before they only spoke of him as the "executionar".
If I may suggest, perhaps you should all know what Dedic wants you to do.
He's at my apartment now.
His condition is serious.
Shot through the lung
But why did he go, of all places, to you?
- It was a terrible risk to expose you.
- He took every possible precaution.
He changed taxi's a number of times.
Went through buildings and backyards... until he was dead certain no one had followed him.
He could have come here just as well.
And we would have called in another doctor without involving you.
He did not just come to me just for me to treat his wound.
- What else?
- To give me in detail my instructions.
- Instructions?
- Where do you come into this?
As Dedic sees it, we are faced with two vital problems... each depended upon the other.
If we could find a way of saving the lives of the remaining hostages... or as many as possible... we would at the same time restore the unity of the city. it would be a tremendous victory...
But in the end, it's either the hostages or you. We can't save both.
I don't see any possible chance of us getting these 2 birds with one stone.
As Dedic sees it, there is a chance.
What about those bloodstains in your cab?
I never would have put 2 and 2 together... the car washer here calls me tonight... and tells me he found blood drops on the backseat of my cab.
- Just then I was home eating my soup...
- I'm not interested in your soup.
What makes you think I'm interested in a cab... where some passenger maybe had a nose bleed?
Herr Gruber, he recognized the description of Dedic from tonight's newspapers... as one of his passengers.
- Where did you drop this passenger?
- Well... that's the trouble...
I don't remember.
Maybe he was the one I took to Czerny St, but, maybe not.
This is crap!
We have a list of his runs today.
We could send someone to everyone of these places.
Listen, you tell me at 11:30 at night... that this man went to one of 15 different houses this afternoon...
And you really think this Dedic, if it was he... will kindly wait for us... until we come to call on him to pay our respects?
Get them out of here!
Go home and finish your soup.
Querida?
Arnold...
Come here.
Hey!
Hey, you with the soup!
What was that address you think you dropped him at?
Czerny St,
61 Czerny St.
Czerny St. Czerny St.
Czerny St, 61.
Czerny St.
Czerny St.
Czerny St!
Czerny St.
Czerny St.
"Czerny St, 21."
From 21 to 61, is 20 houses.
- Dr. Svoboda?
- Yes.
Gestapo.
- You live here alone?
- Yes.
You didn't per chance receive a visit from a man with a bullet wound?
No.
- You can't go in there!
- Stop this non-sense!
Men!
Open!
Well, the situation here would tend to exclude the presences... of any third person.
Sorry... but you see, we are looking for the uncle of a certain Mr. Bartos...
Who asked me to deliver his last farewell.
In person.
Muller, check the whole building from cellar to roof.
Every room and closet.
Yes, sir.
Attention.
Come in doctor, come in. No, no, no,
Miss Novotny, please remain as you are.
I'm only staying a little while.
Catch my breath, and smoke a cigarette.
If I may, doctor?
Well, well, my young friend...
I don't mind admitting I'm surprised.
You see doctor, personally,
I have never been fully convinced...
Of your marvelous quick success of Miss Novotny.
And you, Miss Novotny, you surprise me even more.
After all, you're engaged to be married in a few weeks... but I suppose that in wartime life moves a lot faster.
Inspector, there is a limit to these insults.
Of course, doctor, my humble apologies mademoiselle.
- Why don't you leave me alone?
- Just a few more puffs.
You see...
I had no idea I would find you here... at least not tonight.
In my stupid way, I thought I would find a certain gentleman... who in turn, would help me find that other gentleman.
You remember, whom you helped Kladno Av..
That's all very interesting,
Inspector...
But if you insist on keeping us company...
Perhaps you would like a glass of wine to go with your cigarette.
Well, well, doctor,
I would be delighted.
You have no beer?
Of course you have no "beer".
Beer wouldn't be the thing in such a romantic atmosphere.
Sorry, Inspector, the rug.
But better be careful when you stumble near me again, doctor... my boys here got just a little nervous just then.
We have fulfill your orders.
Horak, I thought you might be curious to met...
Dr. Franticek Svoboda, surgeon at St. Pancrazio hospital.
The same gentleman who visited your fiance the other night... under the name "Karel Vanek".
Inspector, why did you have me brought here?
Horak, I thought we both had the right to the whole truth.
You ought to know what your fiance is up too.
Well, I guess this all becomes a personal matter between you three.
Let's go.
I think I'll leave you alone.
Good night.
Jan, you mustn't...
Well, what are you staring at?
You think you own me?
You were lying to me all along.
Yes I was. I just fell in love with him ...
That's all there was to it.
Can't you understand that?
Yes.
I'm sorry Franticek, for all that's happened...
Horak!
It looks like both of us had delusions tonight.
- Find something, Mueller?
- Not at all, Herr Inspector.
- Am I free to leave now?
- Not yet.
What do you say to having a drink on me?
That is an order. Muller!
I want you to watch this house, closely.
If those two try to leave, find out where they go.
- As you order, Herr Inspector.
- Schirmer we'll leave you in the morning.
The small leather case on the desk.
The hypodermic.
Come on sweetheart, get it off your chest.
Take it from me. No woman should be trusted to long.
Ain't it the truth?
Don't be a sucker, big boy.
There are more fish to come.
Well, 6:00 already. What do you say we go over to his place?
That is an order too.
You shouldn't talk.
This wound is serious.
I haven't much time.
I must finish telling you.
Miss Novotny, all our thanks... you're a good fighter.
Almost everything in this plan depends on you.
It will be very difficult...
I believe the people of Prague... will come to help us.
- Gruber come in yet?
- No.
No, and his office can't seem to get in touch with him. He was out all last night.
That must be the little cutie who let him down so hard.
The German offered 20 marks if we could get info about her cheating before.
It was like pulling teeth.
Couldn't even get him to talk about her.
Why does this flatfoot have to know so much about this dame's lovelife?
All he told me was he caught her cheating last night.
Myself, I figured it must had something to do with... politics.
Because Gruber says, how could a nice girl like that run around like that... when her father is one of the hostages going to be killed any minute.
Come on, fatty, wake up.
Let me sleep... you'll get your money tonight.
I'll be waiting.
So long, big boy.
Just pretend you never knew her.
Too-da-lu!
Is it possible now, to tell his real name?
No, but his name will not be forgotten.
One day the school children will honor it.
"In retaliation for the cowardly murder of the Reich Protector... it is ordered that commencing at 2:00 today... executions will be carried out every 2 hrs instead of 24... unless the assassin is surrendered."
Pardon me.
Good morning, Mr. Czaka.
- This is absurd.
- But I tell you I'm sure.
- You've mistaken me for somebody else.
- No, I'm sure of it.
Miss please, everyone is looking at us.
- I tell you, you're absolutely wrong.
- I'm not wrong.
Please, miss, please.
You must met me,
I have to talk to you alone.
Miss, what do you want with this gentleman?
It is nothing, absolutely nothing.
What do you mean by that?
Such impertinence.
Gestapo. Inspector Schirmer.
Of course.
Naturally that's different then.
I don't know this person.
I've never seen her before.
Miss Novotny, we will clear up this matter somewhere else.
I think you better take this gentleman along to headquarters.
But this is absurd. I will report you to the proper authorities
Alright, alright.
I will not go.
Orders is orders.
I will see that you are properly cared for also.
And where is this note she wrote?
Here.
"I recognize you. must talk to you immediately at once."
Well, what does it mean?
Miss Novotny, this time you're going to talk.
You recognize Mr. Czaka as whom?
What did you want to say to him alone that was so important, huh?
Let me tell you, Herr Ritter, it's very simple.
She says she recognizes me as someone she helped escaped... from Karls Ave. From the Black shirts
The lady insists that I am the man who shot Heydrich.
Me, of all people!
That is perfectly ridiculous of course, Mr. Czaka... but... just wait here a moment... please.
The following 3 persons will please step forward.
You can't take me!
No, no, I won't go! I won't go!
I helped to catch the assassin.
I want to see the commandant!
I want to see the commandant!
I want to see the commandant!
I want to see the commandant!
The following 3 persons will step forward.
Necval.
Skalda...
Votruba.
My name shouldn't be counted. That was the agreement for speaking on the radio.
Shut up!
All three of you, forward march!
Miss Novotny, perhaps you are afraid because you lied to us before...
But if you tell the truth now,
I promise to overlook that.
Remember, we won't stop the executions until we have the assassin.
In a few hours, in any case by tomorrow... all hostages will have been shot.
The odds for your Father... are growing smaller by the minute.
This is your last chance,
Miss Novotny.
I was on the Karls Ave.
You saw the assassin run from the alley?
Yes, it was the man I saw in the restaurant.
- The brewer, Czaka?
- Yes.
In what direction did he escape from?
Just around the corner from Dresden St, just where I told the officer.
Did you see him running until he was out of sight?
No, there was a passing cab, and it drove off with him.
For your sake, Miss Novotny,
I'm glad you added that detail.
It confirms with a voluntary statement from the same cab driver.
Ritter, bring in Czaka.
And the horse cab driver.
That's him, alright.
I've never seen this man before.
You picked him up on the corner of Karls Ave and Dresden?
Yes, sir. And he said:
"Drive as fast as you can."
Where did he ask to be taken?
Some place with furnished rooms, with no questions asked.
Like I told you this morning.
It's ridiculous.
Ridiculous!
The man has got me mixed up with somebody else.
Herr Standarten Fuhrer... during the time of the assassination of his Excellency... the late Reich Protector... at that very time, I was having lunch at the Golden Quail...
Where I always eat, just like today.
You can check it quite easily.
Do you remember day when the Reich Protector was shot?
Naturally, what Czech doesn't?
- It was last Wednesday at noon.
- Exactly.
And on that day, at that time, did
Mr. Czaka have lunch at your restaurant?
- Now you'll see...
- No, your excellency.
No, Mr. Czaka didn't come in that day.
I remember it like my own birthday.
I held his usual table for him, your excellency.
I even said to Albert here, maybe Mr. Czaka is sick or something.
- But Novak, I was there.
- No, Mr. Czaka.
No, Mr. Czaka, I remember because I put on your table your favorite Rhine wine... the old Riesling. But I had to take it off when you didn't show up.
No.
You're all mixed up.
You, how can you make such a mistake?
Please try to remember.
I was there.
Freddy, you brought me a pack of cigarettes.
I dropped them on the floor, remember?
No, Mr. Czaka, that was the day before the shooting.
Pauline, didn't you check my hat that day, as always?
Didn't I even pinch your cheek, and you said: "No, Mr. Czaka"?
Didn't I tip you nicely, as always?
You always do, Mr. Czaka, but not that day.
- You didn't come that day.
- You're crazy!
You, all of you, crazy!
What's going on here anyway?
What is the meaning of all of this?
I demand an explanation!
Stop shouting at me,
Mr. Czaka.
We demand an explanation.
Where were you at the time of the assassination?
I told you.
I told you, in the Golden Quail, eating.
And after lunch I had a business... conference with Mr. Tomas Pulta, the bearing manufacturer.
Yes, in his own apartment until 5:30.
How do you remember that time so well?
Because at 6:00 I had another appointment right here... in the Gestapo, with Inspector Gruber.
I was with him until way after midnight helping him prepare the list... the list of the hostages.
Brodavka.
Vystyd.
Pescacek.
Walk out!
- Good bye, Pescacek.
- Good bye.
Come on, come on.
Sing "The Invisible Torch"!
...and pass it along...
Keep it burning,
Keep it burning,
keep it forward on the road that has no turning.
Die if you must, for a cause that is just...
but shout to the end:
'No Surrender'.
Stop the singing!
- Ever onward, never returning
- Silence!
- the filthy butcher will be learning.
-Stop the singing!
this war isn't won until the last battle is done.
Carry on,when we are gone.
No surrender!"
No surrender!
I must regret to inform you, the bearing manufacturer, Mr. Pulta... was one of the hostages executed at 2:00 this afternoon.
Pulta?
Shot?
How does he get on the list?
I had business with him.
I didn't suggest his name.
I suppose I ought to apologize for neglecting to notify you?
In any case, his widow Mrs. Pulta, testifies you never appeared that day.
- What?
- But, here is another lady...
- who can tell us the exact reason.
- I don't know this woman.
Mrs. Nimitz, last night you testified that on the day of the assassination... the cab brought a certain well dressed man to your rooming house.
Yes, this man here.
Will you repeat your testimony please?
Just as you gave it last night?
He came exactly at half pass twelve noon.
I showed him a room for 3 marks.
He told me he was expecting a lady friend, if I wouldn't mind.
I said: "Well, if you guarantee she's decent, who cares".
- So then, he gave me 5 marks.
- Lies! All lies!
How can you listen to these traitorous Czechs?
How can you take their word against mine! I protest!
You know I'm loyal. For years I've kept you informed of the underground.
Only yesterday you got seven through me! Seven! Only yesterday!
How can you be so unfair?
Will you kindly permit the witness to continue?
Uninterrupted.
Will you go on, Mrs. Nimitz, please.
Well, no lady showed up all afternoon long.
Just heard him walking up and down the room.
And after a while he comes out and says he wants to telephone somebody ... but I said: "I wouldn't even have a phone if I could afford one ... because it is more trouble than it's worth."
Then about half past five, he comes out wants to see the afternoon papers... all about the shooting of the "Hangman"...
Reich Protector Heydrich.
Then he just put on his hat and went.
But this morning, after I was questioned and went home...
I remember something I found after this gentleman left his room.
Here, I brought it with me, even though it's real gold.
It has your initials,
Mr. Czaka.
I don't understand.
I had it, this morning.
I'm sure.
I must have left in the restaurant.
This is a frame up.
A fantastic frame up!
Don't be preposterous.
Are you trying to say the whole city of Prague is conspiring against you?
None of these people know each other at all.
A minute ago, you said you had no telephone at all. Didn't you?
Yes.
Alright!
Now I'll prove that everything you said was a filthy dirty lie...
And this whole thing nothing but a criminal conspiracy.
She said I was in her rooming house between 12:30 and 5:30.
Very well.
She also says she hasn't got a telephone.
Then how was it at 2:30 I was talking to somebody on the telephone?
And who was that somebody?
Gestapo Inspector Gruber.
I demand that Inspector Gruber be brought in immediately to confirm this.
I also demand the arrest and investigation... everyone of these slimy perjurers.
Call Inspector Gruber.
We have been unable to contact
Inspector Gruber all day.
His office is still trying to locate him.
Just for a pick me up.
No more beer around?
No more beer.
What's so funny all of a sudden?
- I like that lipstick.
- What lipstick?
All over your face.
I see!
Yeah... that lipstick on the doctor's face was perfect... not all smeared up.
You're right, Jan, old boy, your girl is still all yours.
They staged it.
But a little too perfectly.
Thanks for the assassin.
What do you mean?
If they staged that bedroom act, then the uncle must have really been there... and your little girl put one over on old man Gruber.
And why?
Because one or the other must be the assassin...
Dr. Svoboda or Uncle Dedic.
And your little sweetheart is an accomplice to the same assassins.
But this time she is going to talk, and talk fast.
It's broken.
Miss Novotny, your assassin Mr. Czaka... seems to have a perfect alibi...
No less than Gestapo Inspector Gruber.
Yes, Miss Novotny,
Inspector Gruber.
You just wait till he gets here.
But what about all the hostages in the meantime?
The executions will cease the minute the case is finished.
Not before.
But, if Gruber confirms Czaka's alibi... everyone of the witnesses today... with you first, will go to the wall with the hostages.
Well, we will now go look into this alibi of Dr. Svoboda.
It's really worth looking into you know.
Then we'll take care of you and your faithful sweetie.
Now if you will excuse me, Mr. Horak,
I will have to hurry.
Just relax.
Can you tell me where to find
Dr. Svoboda?
He is in operating, assisting Professor Kubicek.
Thanks.
Close the door, Beda.
Plenty lucky for you mother was worried about Mascha... and sent me to ask you.
Attention!
Gestapo Inspector Gruber!
- Wait!
- Attention! Attention!
Gestapo Inspector Gruber!
Inspector Gruber, report to headquarters at once!
Beda, go over there and wait.
See if the Gestapo goes poking around.
If she shows up, don't let her go up there.
I won't, future brother-in-law.
St. Pancrazio Hospital, and step on it!
Dr. Svoboda?
That's Dr. Svoboda.
- Detective Gruber, you looking for me?
- Yes.
Just a few questions, doctor.
Where can we talk undisturbed?
Here, in the locker room.
Talk me doctor, when you fellows operate... you always wear these masks?
Naturally, against infection.
I thought you said we could talk here all alone?
It's all the same.
My colleague, Dr. Pillar.
Inspector Alois Gruber,
Gestapo.
You were the other one at the operation the day he shot Heydrich.
Exactly, Inspector,
Dr. Pillar as you say... did take my place that day, with the mask.
Very clever.
- May I use your telephone, Dr. Svoboda?
- No.
No, you better not use that phone.
You better put that down, doctor.
I'm gonna put it where it belongs.
If you think you're gonna rush me from both sides... that I can only get to one of you in time...
Then you're gonna be unpleasantly surprised.
I can shoot this gun a lot quicker... then both of you can jump.
Not bad, doctor.
That was close.
But stand right where you are... or you get a slug in the gut.
I was at the doctor when I heard the radio call for Inspector Gruber... of course I came immediately.
You say you were with him this morning, Mr. Horak?
Yes, you see the Inspector and I... went to a cabaret last night.
Well, he stayed all night at my apartment
When did he leave you?
I should say about
10 o'clock this morning.
- Did he happen to say where he was going?
- Yes, I believe he did.
I think he mentioned he had an appointment with a Mr. Czaka at his house.
Where?
Czaka's house.
Ritter, bring Herr Czaka around.
Thank you, Mr. Horak.
I'm sorry, but I have to hold you like the other witnesses... until all of this is settled.
Go to Czaka's house and see if
Gruber was there this morning.
Mr. Czaka, when did you last see Inspector Gruber?
Yesterday afternoon.
Here at the Gestapo.
And where were you this morning from 10 o'clock on?
At home, until noon.
And then two of Gruber's men came to escort me to the Golden Quail.
Gruber wasn't with you before then?
No, I told you I haven't seen him at all today.
Excuse me.
Yes?
Czaka... between 10 and 12 this morning...
Inspector Gruber was with you... at your home.
No, Herr Haas.
- Who said that?
- Your butler.
Why, Herr Haas, that's impossible.
The man can be insane.
I demand to see him.
Face to face!
At 10 o'clock this morning, when Inspector Gruber arrived, I showed him into the study... then Mr. Czaka sent me down to the railway station for a timetable.
Josef, where do you get these hallucinations, haven't I always paid you well?
- Why do you tell such lies?
- Will you kindly keep quiet Mr. Czaka?
- Go on please.
- When I had returned, the Inspector had gone.
- Where is the study?
- Right in there, but it's locked.
After Mr. Czaka left, the maid wanted to go in to clean... we couldn't find the key anywhere.
Break the lock.
Can't do that, it's an genuine antique.
That's Gruber's calling card.
Someone put them there!
Get the caretaker of the building!
Timetable.
Timetable?
Switzerland.
You said your butler had hallucinations, Mr. Czaka?
Your Excellency, I assure you I...
My desk!
I protest!
Checkbook.
Czaka, this check for 10,000 marks...
Whom did you give it to?
To the Occupational Police fund.
I'm not interested for what purpose you gave the money, but to whom you gave it.
To Inspector Gruber.
Damned pig!
Yours, Mr. Czaka?
No,I never had a gun.
Herr Haas, this pistol was made in England.
The exact same caliber of the bullet that killed the Reich Protector.
Impossible, Herr Haas!
All of this is false, completely false.
If you only got Herr Gruber here, all these accusations would be proven false.
The whole thing is a frame up, an awful frame up!
Herr Fuhrer Standarten, there is a mimeograph in closet.
I'm innocence. I swear I am!
The underground planted all of this to pin the assassination on me!
Where is Haas?
Herr Standarten Fuhrer!
Schirmer! Downstairs!
Miss Novotny, you are free to go.
Czaka was the assassin.
We even found the gun in which he shot Heydrich.
The remaining hostages will be released in the morning.
Have you anyway of telling whether my father...?
No.
This scum must have been working for both sides all this time.
It looks like Gruber caught on to him but couldn't be bribed.
Not Gruber.
So, Czaka had to get rid of him.
Pull around the corner.
Czaka, get out of here.
You're free, Czaka.
Free?
- Free!
- Sure. Go on.
Schirmer, I'll never forget you for this, never forget you!
Go on! Run!
Heil, Hitler!
Excellency, this is the report in code from Berlin.
Ever onward, no returning...
until the filthy butcher will be learning...
this war isn't won until the last battle is done.
Carry on when we are gone.
No surrender!!
No surrender!!
NO SURRENDER !!
{3676}{3741}What?
{3748}{3833}Stop, stop the car.
{3848}{3943}You yeIIow skin, stop the car.

{9796}{9836}I know.
{9843}{9880}I have seen it in the newspaper.
{9897}{10022}Who beat Chuen at the|PoIice Competition.
{10186}{10266}Sorry, I am busy.
{11254}{11296}Miss Siu.
{11352}{11469}Any Ietters from Saam?
{11494}{11666}We've Iost contact since my dad died.
{11827}{11919}He must think...
{11923}{12008}It's him who kiIIed you dad.
{12036}{12093}To be sorry.
{12219}{12266}Anyway Miss Siu.
{12311}{12491}His advantage is honest.
{12556}{12608}He's not cIever.
{12627}{12782}But he's serious to himseIf.
{12787}{12849}Otherwise he can't Iive any Ionger.
{12862}{12962}That's pity.
{13000}{13112}Nowadays not many modern|students are that.
{13204}{13241}So...
{13276}{13413}I Iike him this way.
{13674}{13769}Forget it, it's painfuI.
{13806}{13853}Karate?
{13982}{14037}As strong as you are aIso feeIs pain.
{14105}{14160}Being a winner Iike you aIso feeIs pain.
{14247}{14284}It's sad aIthough I won.
{14321}{14366}Sometimes I don't want to win.
{14492}{14534}So you can...
{14606}{14641}Lose.
{14698}{14730}Can put it this way.
{14904}{14994}But I can't Iose.
{15069}{15136}Anyway I must win.
{15363}{15400}Sorry.
{15406}{15473}ShouIdn't taIk this to you.
{15518}{15574}I just want to say.
{15575}{15717}Learning Karate isn't that easy.
{15754}{15814}And I am not quaIified to be the master.
{15868}{15905}I am aIso a student.
{15971}{16016}Sorry.
{16084}{16139}Guests are coming.
{16253}{16388}Mr. Po, the transIator of|the American Embassy.
{16462}{16552}It's weII done for you to beat|the American.
{16564}{16654}Being a Japanese I aIso feeI excited.
{16661}{16798}A American boxer.
{16801}{16868}To Japanese he's a artist.
{16893}{16983}He's the strongest boxer in USA.
{16986}{17053}CaIIed WiIIiam Star, he's in Japan now.
{17070}{17135}He heard the news.
{17153}{17215}Say the boxing skiIIs of that saiIor.
{17221}{17348}It's a shame to say that is|the standard of a boxer.
{17378}{17425}What does he want?
{17430}{17495}That means...
{17499}{17559}For the Japanese and Americans,|you are the representative.
{17574}{17726}To have a fight with|the American representative WiIIiam .
{17742}{17794}That is.
{17803}{17850}What is boxing?
{17855}{17890}Boxing.
{17916}{17996}Means using fists to fight.
{18007}{18062}Two participants.
{18082}{18134}Wear the boxing gIoves.
{18136}{18316}To hit the opponent's upper body.
{18356}{18493}Then the face and the nose|wiII be bIeeding.
{18540}{18645}That's a bIoody tragedy.
{18653}{18703}The foreigners Iike that.
{18772}{18819}A competition of amusement.
{18870}{18907}I don't Iike to be a joker.
{18936}{18971}So...
{18984}{19029}I Iike quick and simpIe.
{19044}{19111}But there is a katate man wants|to take part.
{19122}{19169}None of my business.
{19207}{19274}No matter how.
{19315}{19347}No way.
{19448}{19558}At Ieast pIease have a Iook at it.
{19575}{19695}Coming at the American Embassy.
{19732}{19769}I wiII send you the invitation.
{19887}{19934}Storming.
{20515}{20612}I may get you invoIved.
{20709}{20764}Do they want to revenge?
{20799}{20836}Don't go to the Embassy.|I wiII go.
{20904}{20994}I want to see the fight.
{21759}{21849}It's not exciting to empIoy a referee.
{21854}{21909}It shouId be fighting tiII coIIapsed.
{22561}{22613}Get up, fight.
{24304}{24346}Where are you going?
{24359}{24389}Going home.
{24398}{24430}Why?
{24458}{24503}I don't Iike to see this pIay.
{24515}{24605}The fight between Star and the karate|man is about to start.
{24611}{24671}Ask them to stop.
{24716}{24761}Stop the fight.
{24777}{24814}How come?
{24826}{24896}They are too stupid.
{24925}{24997}Ask the to fight Iike chicken and dogs.
{25045}{25142}Japanese shouIdn't do this.
{26542}{26634}Everybody.
{26649}{26844}Very gIad to see that you Iike this fight.
{26860}{26892}Wait.
{27478}{27513}What?
{27544}{27594}Stop the fight.
{27640}{27672}Why?
{27675}{27715}For the Japanese Karate.
{27802}{27842}I don't think we'II Iose.
{27846}{27906}It's not the probIem of winning or Iosing.
{28015}{28050}For what?
{28356}{28396}Since boxing is not kung fu.
{28541}{28598}What do you fight for?
{28776}{28918}I am Kwan from Sam Stream, you are...
{28962}{29037}Saam Chee of the Station.
{29369}{29409}I teII you.
{29437}{29484}What do you fight for?
{29528}{29618}We are broke if we don't do this.
{29672}{29737}We have no other choice.
{29886}{29983}It may be because of you.
{33245}{33292}Master.
{33413}{33495}I think fighting is a pain.
{33568}{33663}I fight for karate with him.
{33692}{33817}I think onIy use the skiIIs to win.
{33854}{33961}Of course, the famiIy of the Ioser.
{33990}{34120}And the foIIowers wiII hate me.
{34122}{34199}For kung fu, I don't mind.
{34214}{34334}But for winning.
{34343}{34420}See many are beaten.
{34467}{34507}I reaIIy want to forget karate.
{34624}{34674}Finish.
{34770}{34917}Two years experience on traveI.
{34996}{35043}That's aII.
{35204}{35256}Nothing has changed.
{35283}{35323}You are stiII the same.
{35554}{35664}I see your pain.
{35727}{35759}No.
{35782}{35894}Your pain is my pain.
{36015}{36112}But I beIieve.
{36182}{36307}That's necessary for the future.
{36533}{36715}Fighting is the way to unite the others.
{36809}{36909}Agreements can't bring true peace.
{36989}{37049}Don't be afraid of the constraints.
{37156}{37203}I...
{37239}{37376}BeIieve karate to be invoIved in the fight.
{37534}{37691}It's not the fight for the name.
{37803}{37913}That's not my priye.
{37962}{38037}Not your winning either.
{38079}{38126}No.
{38152}{38224}Can be said that's aIso not the winning|for karate.
{38308}{38483}That's the winning for the Japanese Arts.
{38862}{38914}Mr. Chee.
{38953}{39000}Mr. Chee.
{39006}{39046}Haven't you had your dinner?
{39076}{39118}Coming to have it in the Station?
{39163}{39218}To eat with you in the Kitchen.
{39224}{39296}100o/o Iike a student.
{39334}{39429}I thought the famous Saam Chee.
{39434}{39516}Must be scary with Iong beard.
{39550}{39585}ReaIIy.
{39594}{39669}My grand chiIdren are scared.
{39689}{39744}The songs say.
{39763}{39825}Saam is coming.
{39841}{39876}Don't sing.
{39923}{40025}It's not good not to be true.
{40053}{40093}It's because it's too strong.
{40117}{40172}Better to be simpIer.
{40440}{40535}It's Iong time not to see you|scratch your head.
{40557}{40614}Haven't seen your beard face for|a Iong time.
{40806}{40893}The four men of the Station are here.
{41012}{41129}Good.
{41288}{41355}Haven't seen you for a Iong time.
{42668}{42728}I am back.
{42823}{42905}I am sorry for your dad.
{43062}{43137}I am coming to see him.
{44886}{44951}You are the same.
{45148}{45195}Master aIso says that.
{45285}{45332}I am useIess.
{45400}{45457}I aIways feeI worried.
{45519}{45554}No way.
{45777}{45849}I can't even Iove woman.
{45883}{46005}Can't do anything to be a chick.
{47013}{47103}Regards from Siu.
{47202}{47304}The cIothes on your body.
{47305}{47502}It's time to change, take it.
{47564}{47604}However...
{47686}{47756}Take it.
{48175}{48217}A strange man has come.
{48431}{48483}What's your name?
{48487}{48532}Tin Kuo.
{48682}{48714}The other one.
{48727}{48772}Yuen Kuo.
{49094}{49139}PIease have a Iook at the Station.
{49143}{49208}Tin and Yuen Kuo.
{49499}{49559}SaIute before going in.
{49591}{49658}We don't have this kind of saIute.
{49682}{49782}It may be the ruIes of foreigners.
{49796}{49838}But here is Japan.
{49856}{49888}Forget it.
{50067}{50154}Woo, Chun.
{50172}{50254}Ten, Saam Chee.
{50341}{50413}Is Samm Chee here?
{50618}{50670}He's here.
{51880}{52382}Yuen.
{52813}{52870}I am Chin.
{52925}{52982}It's karate.
{53039}{53114}Tin Kuo of Kuo Karate.
{53139}{53184}He's Yuen.
{53225}{53325}PIease forgive my brother|who broke the waII.
{53343}{53378}Since he's sick.
{53424}{53519}Is Chee Kuo...
{53527}{53592}Your reIative?
{53635}{53757}My eIder brother is too weak.
{53786}{53846}His karate...
{53857}{53914}I think it's too strong.
{53926}{53968}Why?
{53998}{54073}But he Iost to Chee.
{54113}{54183}But my karate is very different.
{54208}{54265}Have you seen karate?
{54309}{54389}Your brother just showed.
{54398}{54435}That's a joke.
{54464}{54511}To warm up.
{54562}{54614}I want to fight with Chee.
{54630}{54687}That's why I come here.
{54757}{54792}Sorry we can't accept.
{54802}{54824}Why?
{54846}{54883}We are different.
{54985}{55162}I think your karate is not an art.
{55253}{55365}No saIute before coming in the Station.
{55411}{55478}No saIute when seeing a man.
{55535}{55680}This kind of man isn't an artist at|any time.
{55779}{55864}You reaIIy can taIk.
{56124}{56249}WiII you accept if he agrees?
{56282}{56314}Too stupid.
{56319}{56349}No.
{56374}{56434}Chee is my student.
{56475}{56517}We have the same spirit.

{81619}{81689}I don't hate them.
{81708}{81820}But they don't know how to be a man.
{81856}{81923}Tin is a snake.
{81987}{82194}He has got my worst former|disadvantage.
{82330}{82492}Yuen is sick.

{108406}{108583}I don't want to be kicked out so|I put down the name board myseIf.
{108599}{108644}What do I do wrong?
{108749}{108799}I have braken the ruIes.
{108828}{108865}To have a fight with foreigners.
{108915}{108982}They don't know Japanese Arts.
{109039}{109149}I can ignore or teach them.
{109198}{109348}I think I shouId teach them.
{109422}{109479}Just for this.
{109620}{109757}You are stupid.
{109821}{109991}You are stupid to the ruIes.
{110026}{110058}RuIes are ruIes.
{110113}{110168}You are for the Arts.

{112090}{112170}Let me stay here tonight.
{112178}{112218}I want to think.

{112388}{112428}It's good if I can sIeep.
{112450}{112490}I can't sIeep recentIy.
{112496}{112521}Why?
{112523}{112560}The enemies aIways appear.

{122030}{122097}The sickness happens again.
{122752}{122787}You are having good Iuck.

{146088}{146168}I go to bring some water.
{146535}{146670}Lost...
Yes? Just a minute. Your call, Colonel.
Thank you.
Hello. Captain York, please.
You know, if this thing works out, it might give our boys all the way from Bataan to Singapore a big lift.
And it may pull a lot of
Japs back to their islands.
- It'll work out, General.
- I'm sure it will.
Hello. Hello, York? Doolittle.
York, I want you to get 24
B-25s with volunteer crews down to Eglin Field as soon as you can.
The job will take them out of the country for about three months.
Tell them it's a secret mission.
They won't know where they're going until they get there.
That's right, volunteers.
Tell them they're not to talk to anybody. That's an order.
I'll join you in a few days. Right.
Zero-two-two-four-one to Eglin Tower.
Three B-25s request traffic and landing instructions.
Go ahead.
Army four-one. The left-hand pattern.
Wind direction north by northeast.
Land on runway number three.
There's the field all right.
Boy, did you ever see such a wide runway?
She's big all right.
You could almost close your eyes and get in.
And I'd give plenty to know where we go from here.
Yeah, so would I.
Hey, don't do anything till I get my camera.
How does she look from the nose, Clever?
Great. Florida, palm trees, alligators, bathing beauties.
Hey, Thatcher, have a look at some real country.
It's not as pretty as Billings, sir.
Did you keep the cookies this trip, Thatcher?
Yes, sir. I had a little trouble coming over the mountains, but I hung on.
- Zero-two-two-four-one to flight. - Hey, wait a minute.
We'll go around, make an echelon right
once over the field, then break away. Let's make it pretty.
Here's for luck.
Switch is off!
- 5:25. Not bad time.
- Yeah, we moved.
Better write that left engine up. She sounded a little rough.
Boy, I got some swell shots, Lawson.
You really made a nice break away.
Gave me kind of an artistic angle.
Some day I'll do a crash landing so you can get a real movie.
Thatcher says that Florida can't compare to Billings.
Trouble with Thatcher is he thinks that any place with more than 300 people
- is overcrowded.
- Oh, according to the last census, sir,
Billings has a population of 16,380.
16,000! Oh, no, Thatcher, you must be thinking of Greater Billings.
No, he's right, Clever. They count the cows up in that country.
- Sorry, sir.
- Yes.
- Cameras aren't allowed on the field.
- What?
That's right, sir.
A lot of secret work goes on here, and they're very strict about it.
Well, I can't see anything secret from here.
Then I'll have to report you to the Commanding Officer, sir.
Those are my orders.
Okay. Okay.
Hey, look, Brick Holstrom's still with us.
We were afraid you wouldn't get that turkey in till tomorrow.
Why, that baby flies so pretty we floated the last 200 miles.
- Are you guys ready?
- Yeah. Come on, Brick.
Oh, Thatcher, I'll be right back and tell you where your quarters are.
Yes, sir.
Come on, Davey, you've got an idea. What's the dope?
- Where do we go from here?
- I already told you.
All they said was that it'd take us out of the country, we'd be gone about three months and that it'd be dangerous.
Look, I got the real dope from Joe Randall.
He says they're forming patrol squadrons to guard the Canal.
What's dangerous about Canal patrol?
Well, what are we worrying about?
Ski will give us all the dope when we check in anyhow.
Three ships in, sir.
Holstrom, Lawson, and myself.
- Good. Your ships okay?
- Yes, sir.
Sit down.
Where we staying, Ski?
The government's leased a hotel near here.
They call it the Officers' Club.
The men whose wives are coming can stay there.
The other officers' quarters are in Barracks 5.
Is Emmy coming down?
- She'll be here in a couple of days.
- Where'll I put Thatcher, Ski?
The enlisted men are assigned to Barracks 12.
Okay.
- Anything else?
- Nope?
At least, not until tomorrow morning.
Well, we'll be seeing you.
Say, Ski, the guys are all crazy to know what's up.
You know as much about it as I do.
We may be given more information in the morning.
Well, beat me, daddy! Look who's coming!
Well, well, well, plant me now and dig me later, if it isn't the pride of
Randolph Field. How are you, boy?
Great, Shorty. The minute we heard that razzmatazz, we knew you must be somewhere around.
- You volunteer for this deal, too?
- Sure enough.
They had me stationed up in Minneapolis.
Coldest country I ever did see.
I'd have volunteered for anything to get back in the sunshine.
- Where you been?
- Columbia, South Carolina.
- Bob!
- Hello, Ted.
You guys know each other?
Oh, we just went through
Kelly together, that's all.
- Sure. Bob was bridesmaid at my wedding.
- Wedding?
Nobody tells me anything anymore.
How long you been balled up and chained down?
Six months, in five more days.
Well, blow my foot off. Skin me again, boy.
Hey, Davey, what are you doing down here?
- Brick!
- Hi, Don.
- I thought you were hunting subs.
- Was. Got me one, too.
- You in on this deal?
- Sure. I've got a swell crew and it looked like it was going to be something, so why not?
- Any ideas what we might be up to?
- Oh, just a hunch.
Yeah? Well, give.
South Seas. Knock ourselves off a few meatballs.
Yeah?
Three.
Honest man. Dealer takes two.
- You know, I just got an idea.
- About what?
About where we might be going.
The way it looks to... No, that's not right. Forget it.
Says two.
- You know, I've got an idea too.
- Yeah?
I've got an idea you're pretty much of a dope to have come in on this deal in the first place.
What kind of a crack is that?
Oh, I don't know. You're married. You've got a swell girl.
I never would have stuck my neck out if I were in your boots.
Go away. You say two?
And up two.
Those guys are off again.
Hey, stand up there.
Who do you think you are?
Have you ever carried a navigator in your ship before, Spike?
Neither have I, until I volunteered for this job.
Oh, we're going to see some fancy stuff, all right. I kind of got a feeling.
Shoot me for a pole cat.
Do I see two red-blooded citizens lying on their backsides while the Texas anthem is being rendered?
On your feet, men.
What are you beefing about,
Shorty? You're from Virginia.
That's right, sharp cat, but my pal here, he's from
Texas, and he takes offense easy.
- Hello, Joe.
- Hello, Joyce. I've got some news.
Hey, you guys, shut up!
Quiet, fellows. Listen.
Jimmy Doolittle's down here and he's a Lieutenant Colonel now.
Jimmy Doolittle! A southern boy from Southern California.
Let's have Eyes of Texas for
Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle.
Attention!
Gentlemen, Lieutenant Colonel Doolittle.
As you were.
You men are here because you've volunteered.
You have been told it's a dangerous mission.
I can't tell you any more than that now, but I want to emphasize the danger.
The most important thing at the moment is secrecy.
I don't want you to even tell your wives what you see down here.
And if you think you've guessed where you're going, you're probably wrong. But don't even talk about your guess.
If the slightest word about this mission gets around, you will endanger not only your own lives, but the lives of thousands of other men.
Now I want to ask you a question.
Has anybody tried to talk to you about this?
Good. If anybody on the field or off the field tries to engage you in conversation as to why you're here, no matter how innocently,
I want you to get his name and give it to me and I'll turn it over to the FBI.
This is going to be the toughest training you've ever had.
You will have the same crew all the way through and the same ship.
And the man or the ship that fails will be dropped.
You're going to do things with a
B-25 you thought were impossible.
Now, if any of you have any doubts,
I'd like you to drop out right now and I promise you that no one will ever think the worse of you.
If you have wives or children or any other considerations that might get on your nerves in a crisis, it's perfectly all right.
As a matter of fact, it's your duty to drop out.
Very well. We'll have these talks as often as possible. That's all.
We're going up this morning for an orientation flight.
There are four auxiliary fields. One, two, three, four.
Line them up and locate them all.
We don't know which we're going to use for our confidential experiments, so familiarize yourselves with all of them.
Look over the countryside, and we'll meet here again at 3:30 this afternoon.
Are there any questions?
Sir, the plugs are being changed in my engines.
To save time, may I go along in Jones' ship?
Right, Smith. All right.
You can go to your ship now.
It looks to me like it's going to be a long time before you swing down Main Street of Billings again, Thatcher.
In Billings, sir, the main street is Minnesota Avenue.
You know, that guy really means business.
- He had me sweating a little.
- Yeah, me too.
- Lieutenant Lawson?
- Yes.
Someone to see you out in front of the PX at J Street, sir.
Thanks. I wonder who would...
I'll be right back.
Ellen!
- Where did you come from?
- I drove to Carolina to surprise you.
- And then they told me you're down here.
- Well, how are you?
I'm just fine, thank you.
And how are you bearing up?
Oh, great. You look just the same.
Well, of course I do. You can't expect any change this soon.
- What's the joke?
- Nothing.
Except you're so funny.
Tell me, honey, were you surprised?
Oh, I couldn't believe my eyes.
Here, let me buy you a drink.
Gee, I'm glad to see you.
Come on, let's go around here.
Tell me, honey, how come you're so cute?
I had to be if I were going to get such a good looking fellow.
You know, there's a lot of things
I want to talk over with you.
Go ahead. Were you really surprised?
Well, no, not exactly.
You know, you go into something like this with your eyes open.
- Naturally you've got to take your chances.
- I see.
Isn't that kind of a cold-blooded way to look at it?
Oh, now, don't get mad. You've got to be cold-blooded about it.
This is the most important thing that's ever happened to me.
- What about me?
- Well, you're in on it, too.
- That's why I want to talk it over.
- That's very generous. Go on, Ted.
Well, in the first place, we've got to keep it a secret.
- I don't want you to tell a soul.
- You're not, I mean, you...
You don't wish it hadn't happened, do you?
Oh, no, of course not.
But it's a military secret, I've got my orders.
Military... Say, what are you talking about?
Well, this job I volunteered for. Didn't you get my letter?
- No. Didn't you get mine?
- No.
Well, I suppose it's very funny, but...
- Hey, Lawson! Ted Lawson!
- Here.
What are you hiding out...
- Ellen, when did you get here?
- Five minutes ago. How's my bridesmaid?
Great. Only I'm going to have to break this up.
Doolittle came out to watch us take off.
Okay. I'll see you for dinner.
There's a hotel about a mile and a half down the road.
I haven't seen it yet, but they tell me you can't miss it.
- I'll find it.
- I'm sorry to have to rush off like this.
Don't forget dinner.
Say, did anybody pick up a letter for me?
Yes, sir. I did this morning.
I forgot all about it.
- Well, bring it up.
- Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, sir.
Okay. Thanks. Take over, will you, Davenport.
Sure.
Hey! I'm going to have a baby!
Hey, it's from Ellen.
She's going to be... I mean,
I'm going to be a father.
Hello, flyer.
Oh, I'm sorry I woke you up.
I wasn't sleeping, really. I was just dozing and thinking.
I'm sorry I didn't get back for dinner. We had a lot of checking to do.
You must've thought I was an awful dope this morning.
But I didn't get your letter until later, so I didn't know.
I know. Sit down.
- I think it's swell about the baby.
- I knew you would. I wasn't a bit worried.
You know, it's going to seem funny.
I don't care whether it's a boy or a girl. Not that much.
I just want you to be okay. It's pretty serious.
- Well, what's so funny?
- I was just thinking.
Here you're getting ready to go off on something really tough, and you're worrying about me.
If I were in your spot,
I'd be scared to death.
- But I guess I am anyhow.
- Purely routine stuff, flyer.
The kind of job every girl takes on once or twice in her life.
Why don't you lie down?
You know, Ellen,
I'm kind of glad I got you.
I guess that's what I was thinking about in my sleep.
It almost frightened me.
It seemed that I was thinking,
"What if I'd never met him?"
Well, for one thing you wouldn't be traipsing around the country from one airfield to another trying to catch up with me.
And for another, you wouldn't be having a baby right in the middle of a war.
Oh, no, it wasn't that.
I was thinking that if I hadn't met you,
I'd never have felt really close to anybody, never in my whole life.
Married six months and together less than two weeks.
That's not being as close as I'd figured on.
Don't you see, Ted, that's just it.
If people can be close when they're far away from each other, well, that's what it should be.
Yeah, yeah, I guess so.
Cuddle me.
I was thinking about last Christmas.
The tree we set up in that Portland auto court.
- Wasn't it an awful little room?
- Yeah.
And the Christmas dinner we were planning on.
And then you ran out of gas and landed in the mud up in lllwaco,
Christmas Eve and Christmas were all over before I saw you again.
Yeah, that was tough. But I got a scarf out of it, anyhow.
Well, it wasn't exactly as we'd planned it.
It was our first Christmas, and somewhere way off, it didn't matter where,
I knew I had you. Oh, Ted, it was the nicest Christmas of my life.
You were born to marry a flyer, Ellen.
I knew that the minute I first saw you.
As a matter of fact that's why I married you.
- You know, I've got a confession to make.
- What?
The truth is, you didn't marry me. I married you.
Oh, you did, eh?
The first time I saw you in the library at LACC,
I said to myself, "Oh, oh, that's for me. "
And from then on, clear up to the night we got the judge out of bed in that little Idaho town, nothing was an accident, Ted.
I planned it that way.
- You think you're pretty smart, don't you?
- I'm not sure whether I do or not.
You see, you didn't put up much of a fight.
I suppose you figured out on that baby, too?
That's something you'll never know, flyer, you'll never know.
Boys are working late these nights.
Yes. Do you have any idea how long you'll be gone?
But as soon as this job is over,
I'm going to ask for a leave.
Two, maybe three weeks.
We'll have that honeymoon you're always talking about.
Yes, just the three of us.
Ted.
I do hope I don't get big and fat like that lady in Chicago.
I want each one of you to know something about the other man's job.
The pilots will practice every job on the plane.
Navigators will learn the work of bombardiers and so forth.
That's in case any of you get shot up.
There's one thing more.
It is inevitable that some of your planes are going to fall into the hands of the enemy.
For this reason, I have ordered your Norden bombsights removed.
Captain Greening has designed a sight which will be perfect for our job.
If there are no questions, I'll ask Captain York to take over.
Just like I said, we patrol off Brazil.
Yeah, but what about taking the Norden Bombsight out?
There's no chance of falling into the hands of the enemy if you're hunting subs.
- I hadn't thought of that.
- That Doolittle's a cheerful cuss, isn't he?
"Just in case any of us are shot up," a bundle of sunshine.
Oh, it's Ted, it's Ted!
George used to buzz me when we were first married.
He doesn't do it any more.
They're not supposed to.
- I wonder if he still loves me.
- I wouldn't worry about that.
Every time Ski gets a new ship he has a terrible love affair with it, but he always comes back to me, especially when he's hungry.
Just think, they'll be gone three months.
I think I'll get a job in a defense factory.
I couldn't stand just sitting around in some little apartment and waiting.
What are you going to do, Ellen?
Oh, I'm just going to sit around and have a baby.
- A baby!
- A baby!
Ellen, why didn't you tell us?
I don't know. I guess I just never thought of a way till now.
As it turns out, it wasn't hard to tell at all.
Well, I'm going to have one, too.
- What?
- Really?
Gee, I think it's wonderful.
George and I have talked about it, but, well, with him away and all,
- I guess I'm just too scared.
- I thought I would be too, but...
Well, Ted and I figured that everything since Pearl Harbor has just been so much velvet.
And then I guessed that if anything should happen to him, only I know nothing will,
I'd have the baby, and that would be a little bit of Ted still living.
I sometimes wonder how we'll feel when it's all over.
Just think, being able to settle down in a little house somewhere and raise your children and never be in doubt about anything.
We'll probably have exactly the same doubts that we have right now.
For example, will he or will he not be home for dinner?
We're about to enter the most secret part of our training.
This field is patrolled on all sides so no one can disturb you at your work.
Gentlemen, this is
Lieutenant Miller of the Navy.
He's going to instruct you in takeoffs.
Instead of the normal B-25 takeoff in 1,500 feet at 90 miles an hour, he's going to show you how to do it with a full load of bombs and gas in 500 feet at 50 miles an hour.
You will attempt no short takeoffs from Eglin Field, where people can see you.
Lieutenant Miller will also give you a few short talks on naval etiquette.
Now, if this gives you any hints as to your destination or as to what kind of work you're going to do, don't even discuss it among yourselves.
I'll ask Lieutenant Miller to take over now.
Gentlemen, those flags out there are at
100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 feet from the starting line.
The line down the center of the field is to guide you in your takeoff.
The kind of work you're going to do won't permit any deviations.
Now, the whole idea is to get up full power before you release your brakes.
Then start, at maximum r. p. m., manifold pressure and with your wing flaps all the way down.
You'll have to rev your motors until you think they're going to burn up.
And then, when they reach the right pitch, and that's a matter of sound and feel more than instruments, release your brakes and hunt for heaven.
I don't expect any of you to do it the first time.
- Gray.
- Yes, sir.
Suppose you and Manch try it first?
The rest of us will stay on the ground, mark your takeoff and check the wind.
Yes, sir.
I think at first we can learn as much by watching trial runs as by actually flying the ships.
So let's all line up over here and see how he does.
- What kind of surface wind, Ski?
- Eight miles an hour.
He didn't have his engines revved up enough.
Lawson, you go next.
Now remember, for our purposes, if you get your wheels a foot off the ground, that's good enough.
You don't need height, but you've got to get your wheels off before you hit the last flag.
A little later we'll try retracting the wheels at around 450 feet and relying on your motors to float the ship.
- Don't try that just yet, though.
- Right, sir.
Now, grab the column and pull her until you feel the inside of your backbone.
Yes, sir.
Did you ever take off a B-25 at 500 feet, sir?
No. But you men will. Don't worry about it.
Watch Lawson there.
You'll have to rev your motors at least that high and maybe higher.
About 700 feet. He burned his tailskid.
Didn't pull his wheels up soon enough.
Brother, that takeoff was strictly on the cob.
That airplane of yours looked exactly like a ruptured duck.
How do you like this guy?
He takes off like an old lady in a high wind, and then he's got the nerve to talk about a real ship.
It's lucky you didn't have a muddy field, or you'd still be there.
If I were you I'd worry about that turkey you and Gray are pushing around the sky.
- The ruptured duck will get along okay.
- Oh, I'm insulted. Come on, fellows.
That won't take long to fix, sir.
Ruptured duck.
Ted.
Don't you think Linda's a good name, if it's a girl?
Oh, yes, yes, it's fine.
No, maybe Nichola. Nichola?
That has a nice sound, don't you think?
What's that? Oh, yes.
Look, honey, we don't have to decide that right now, do we?
No.
Ted.
He wasn't badly hurt, was he?
- Who?
- Johnny Adams.
- How'd you hear about Johnny?
- Those things get around.
- He wasn't hurt, was he?
- Of course not.
I don't know how those things get started.
Every time a guy does a noseover on this field, it's a crack-up.
Ted.
You've been working ever since dinner. Come on, let's get some air.
It's a deal.
Nice.
I'm sorry we haven't had more time together, Ellen.
We can spare a little. We've got all the rest of our lives.
That's right.
Something blooming? It smells good, doesn't it?
- Ted.
- What?
Please, don't worry about anything.
I'm not worrying, just working, that's all.
You know, this is going to be quite a deal.
You're not worried about the deal.
You're worried because you've got a wife.
And that's wrong, Ted.
Say, Bob Gray hasn't been trying to scare you, has he?
- Of course not.
- Okay.
Because there's nothing to worry about, nothing.
Silly, as if I didn't know that.
Besides, if anything did happen, you've got all that government insurance, that'll take care of you and the baby for a long while.
Oh, what am I talking about?
Nothing's going to happen anyhow.
Ted, look at me.
That baby and I, we won't ever need anything but you.
We mustn't either of us be scared about it, Ted.
Because the baby, the baby's why
I know you're coming back to us.
We'd better make this one, or Shorty'll never let us hear the last of it.
Yeah.
- Hear those engines?
- Like music.
Come on, you hopped up bus drivers.
It's been 10 weeks work and one night's fun. Let's go.
- I got my flaps up, brother.
- Heat it up there, Smitty boy.
Steam and sizzle. Where you're going, no one's gonna hold you tight.
Hey there, Doc, don't you know how to dance?
When they start picking flak out of your feet, you'll wish you'd put them to better use.
I'm a doctor, not a jitterbug, Shorty.
- Hey, what gives?
- Shorty's throwing a party.
A party? What for?
Somebody said he's celebrating
Texas Constitution Day.
- Texas Constitution Day?
- Say, I'm gonna sample this.
Grab your gal, Lawson.
Don't you know it's Sam Houston's birthday?
Sam Houston?
For a guy that never saw Texas, that Manch is really sold.
- Hi, Lawson.
- Hi. How did this riot get started?
It's Texas Admission Day.
And that ain't no riot, mister, that's a full-fledged war.
- Seen Ellen?
- I've seen everybody.
- Hello, flyer.
- My dance?
All of them, my boy.
Every dance from now on out, including the last one.
And I love you, Ski. I love you, I love you, I love you.
You know, it's a funny thing. That
Lawson used to be about as graceful as a Texas steer. Now, look at him.
Maybe the girl's got something to do with it.
Ah, you said it that time, Clever.
You know, there's something
I mean to tell you more often,
- but I never seem to get the chance.
- What is it?
Just that I love you.
I got a letter from your mother this morning. Forgot to tell you.
She said to take good care of you.
- How am I doing?
- Better than mother ever dreamed of.
Here. Here.
Now smile and sing.
Ted.
Telephone's ringing.
- Telephone, Ted.
- Oh, sure.
Yeah? Right now? Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
What was it?
Oh, just another night call. But what a night.
I'm sorry.
What time is it?
- Hung-over maybe a little?
- Oh, just a headache.
- I'm not used to party life.
- Poor baby.
You go to sleep. I'll be back by breakfast time.
I'm so sleepy. Goodnight, darling.
Or rather, good morning.
Boy, if I ever get a leave, I'm going to sleep for six days solid.
I wonder what this is.
Well, men, your ships are all serviced, gassed, and ready to go.
You will take off in shifts, the first shift taking off in 45 minutes.
Captain York will give you your clearances.
Now there's one thing that must be thoroughly understood.
After you take off this morning, you are to see no one, speak to no one, telephone no one, not even your wife.
There are no exceptions.
Continue your gas consumption tests to your destination.
Now, the work you will be asked to do will require a little low altitude flying, so hedge-hopping on this trip is perfectly okay.
Only bear in mind that cowboys wear pretty tall hats, so watch your step, men. That's all.
I think you're very well prepared for what you volunteered to do and I want to thank you for a lot of good hard work.
I'll see you in a few days. Good luck.
I hope I get a chance to tell Ellen goodbye.
Yeah, you will.
Your destination is Alameda field.
Take the southern route, refuel at San Antonio and march.
As your names are called you can start. First flight, Holstrom,
Jones, Lawson. Second flight...
- Ted.
- Well, this is it, honey. We're off.
- How soon?
- Just got time to pack.
Where's my B-4 bag?
- In the closet. I'll get it.
- Good.
Socks, shirts.
- My ties in the closet?
- Yes, I have them.
Good.
Wow! Don't go in there in your bare feet, I broke a glass.
All right.
- You forgot your toothbrush.
- Oh, doggone it.
- We got everything?
- I think so.
Swell.
Well, be a good girl and take good care of that baby.
- I will, Ted.
- Yourself, too.
Oh, Ted, I'm going to write you a letter every day you're gone,
I know they won't deliver them. I won't even mail them.
But I'm going to write just the same.
That way, we'll kind of be in touch.
That way, we'll feel close.
Goodbye.
Bye, flyer.
Tell me, honey. How come you're so cute?
I had to be if I was gonna get such a good looking fellow.
I'll be back.
Hey, the Bay Bridge is off to our right.
The Bay Bridge is off to our right.
The Bay Bridge? How about flying under it?
- For why?
- Well, so I can get some pictures.
You know, shooting up at the superstructure.
- Come on, Lawson.
- Do you want to?
- Sure. Go ahead, if it'll make him happy.
- Thanks.
I hope there are no cables hanging under that span.
Here we go.
Let's take a turn and go it again. I forgot to put film in.
We're due at the field. Forget it.
Oh, I may never get another crack at it.
Hey, look.
McClure, take a look down there.
- It's a carrier.
- Yeah. And look at her deck.
B-25's. Holy Smoke. Then this is it.
Kind of small, isn't she?
Pilot to bombardier. Pilot to gunner. Pilot to gunner.
Thatcher. Thatcher.
It's dead again.
We'd better report it to
Doolittle when we get in.
Yeah, that left engine along with it. Still seem a little rough to you?
I can't tell anymore.
- Is everything okay on your ship?
- Why, yes, sir, yes, sir.
Taxi over to the edge of the carrier's wharf. They'll take care of you there.
Yes, sir.
They don't even wait until a fellow gets out.
- All Navy guys are cocky.
- Miller's a Navy guy.
Well, Miller isn't exactly Navy. He's a pilot.
Hey, Spike.
- Spike.
- Spike, what's the matter?
Oh, I put in a beef about my fuel pump and Doolittle told me to take her to the hangar.
Well, then you're not going?
No, and there's nothing really wrong with that plane.
- It's the best ship in the squad.
- Boy, that's rough.
And I nearly told him about our interphone.
You would've been a cooked goose.
I think, sir, I'll go and watch those Navy guys.
- They might bang her up or something.
- That's a good idea.
How do you like that?
They're going to break the Duck's back sure.
How did we get in the clutches of these Navy guys anyhow?
- Boy, that's an awful big ship.
- Yeah, let's take a look at her.
- So long, Spike.
- So long, Spike.
- Be seeing you, Spike.
- Goodbye, fellows.
Lieutenant Lawson, reporting aboard, sir.
- Bettinger, take Lieutenant Lawson to...
- 306, sir.
- This way, sir.
See you guys later.
Lieutenant McClure, reporting aboard, sir.
These are your quarters, sir.
Mr. White and Mr. Felton are on shore leave.
Thank you.
Are you sure you'll be able to find your way back up to the deck, sir?
Oh, sure. Thanks.
What are you doing down here?
Oh, just looking around.
What are you doing here?
Just looking around.
- Are you lost too?
- Am I lost? I'm trapped like a rat.
I've been walking for miles.
This is the biggest cockeyed ship I've ever seen.
Yeah. And I wish the deck was twice as big.
The smoking lamp is out.
The smoking lamp is out.
Sir, "The smoking lamp is out" means no smoking anywhere on the ship.
- Okay.
- Why is that?
Because they're refueling, sir. They'll let us know when they're through.
Hello.
Well, you guys finally got on, huh?
Yeah, we've just been looking the tub over.
- How are your quarters?
- Perfect.
Nice room with two bunks and a cot.
A cot? Follow me, brothers. I'm gonna show you real quarters.
And I mean quarters.
Hats. Hats.
- Well, look at what's here.
- Well, we have guests.
What's the idea of bringing people up here from the tenement district?
This is jocularly known as the admiral's cabin.
Looks like you guys are going to have to start bathing.
This isn't all. There's something else. Follow me.
I'd be glad to.
Careful of the rugs, please.
Now just inside, gentlemen, is something to really feast your peepers on.
The first guy turns in after dinner gets this bed for the trip.
You know who that'll be. Enter.
What dirty, lowlife... Come out of there, you boll weevil!
Well, feed me corn and watch me grow.
How did all this scum get in?
And me in an Army cot.
That's where he'll end up, before the night's over.
- Let's get out of here.
- Oh, Lieutenant!
When you guys go down to dinner, would you mind bringing back a roast beef sandwich, rare, and a piece of huckleberry pie, Lieutenant.
- Well, are you still glad you came along?
- Sure. Aren't you?
- I've got a funny feeling about this job.
- Yeah?
I think maybe it isn't going to be as much of a cinch as we figured on.
Yeah, I've been thinking the same thing.
Well, my ship's over there. I think I'll go take a look at it.
Well, the Duck's up ahead.
I'll see you in the morning.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Who's that?
- That you, Thatcher?
- Oh, yes, sir.
Oh, forget it, Thatcher.
Got her pretty well lashed down, haven't they?
Yes, sir. They did a good job.
I was kind of worried about her, so I thought I'd better come up and have a look.
You lonesome?
I guess everybody is a little, sir.
Don't bother with the sirs,
Dave. Your quarters all right?
- Yeah. Fine.
- Grub's good, too, isn't it?
The best I've had in a long time, sir.
What are you going to do when we get back home, Thatcher?
Oh, I have a girl in Billings, sir.
I'm going to marry her, if we get back.
Oh, we'll get back all right.
Oh, hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I thought I'd come up and shoot the stars for a little while, but I guess it's too foggy.
Pretty foggy, all right.
- What are you guys doing here?
- Oh, just getting a little air.
- Yeah, it's pretty stuffy down below.
- Yeah, it sure is.
You guys worry over the ruptured duck like a bunch of old maids.
Me, I'm going to bed.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Goodnight, Ted.
Wonderful air, isn't it?
The smoking lamp is lit.
The smoking lamp is lit.
- What's wrong? What happened?
- Just battle stations.
Around sunup and sundown the pig boats give us a little trouble so we always lay for them.
This is Jig White and I'm Bud Felton.
- Glad to see you.
- Glad to see you.
- How are you?
- See you later.
- Are we underway?
- For the last five hours.
Glad to have you aboard, Army.
General Quarters, man your battle stations.
Army personnel, man your planes.
Boy, the only way you're going to get that thing off of here is with a crane.
Maybe so. But we kind of think we can take off on our own power.
Hey, where'd they come from?
That's what's known as an escort.
They just slipped up on us during the night.
The Navy likes to do things quietly.
Looks like it's really going to be a show, doesn't it?
Boy, did I hate to part skin from sheet this morning. What a bed.
Oh, this is Shorty Manch.
Jig White and Bud Felton.
- Hello.
- Hi y'all.
This lucky stiff is sleeping in the bedroom off the admiral's cabin.
Yeah. Wonderful accommodations, but nothing much to do.
I thought there'd at least be a poker game or something going on.
Oh, I guess they have them every once in a while.
How about Seven-Toed Pete? Do you ever play much of that around here?
What's Seven-Toed Pete?
Well, it's a kind of seven-card poker.
- I'd be glad to teach it to you some time.
- Never heard of it.
Attention, Army personnel!
Attention, Army personnel!
Assemble in Ward Room.
- See you later, fellows.
- Assemble in Ward Room.
Well, it's been a great pleasure, fellows.
We'll certainly have to get together soon.
Maybe we can get up that little game of poker.
See you later.
You know, I believe that boy wants to play poker.
I wonder if they got their pay before they came aboard.
As you were.
For the benefit of those who haven't already guessed, we're going straight to Japan.
The Navy will take us within 400 miles of the Japanese mainland.
We're going to bomb Tokyo, Yokohama,
Kobe, Osaka, Nagoya.
It'll be a night job and you will be given the opportunity of choosing the city you prefer.
Now, this is going to be a tight squeeze.
The Chinese have prepared small fields just outside of Japanese occupied territory for us to land on after the raid.
They'll gas us up and we'll take off for Chungking.
From now on we're in constant danger of enemy attack.
If there should be a surface attack, stand by your planes with fire extinguishers and let the Navy handle it.
If there should be an attack by air, take off and make for the nearest land.
The Navy will give all navigators their bearings twice a day.
Now once more, I want to emphasize that if...
If any of you feel you're not up to this job, it's perfectly all right for you to drop out.
We have a few spare men and I think we can fill your place.
Get together with Captain York and find out what to do with your planes.
We'll meet here tomorrow afternoon at 2:30.
Are there any questions?
Colonel, do you mind if we smoke during these assemblies?
I have no objection to that if the Navy hasn't. Anything else?
Dismissed.
55, 56... Oh, sorry, Manch.
- Just getting a little exercise.
- Yeah? Well, I wasn't.
I'm measuring off this cockeyed deck.
Nine...
Attention, all personnel. You have been wondering about the mission we are on.
I think you might like to know
that the Army personnel on the
Hornet are going to bomb Japan.
We of the Navy are going to take them in as close to the enemy as possible.
This is a chance for all of us
to give the Japs a dose of their own medicine.
It's an Army-Navy show.
Let's extend every courtesy to the Army men on the Hornet
who are going to do the job.
Good luck, good hunting
and may God speed us on our mission.
Have some?
Thanks, buddy.
You're awfully lucky for guys who never heard of Seven-Toed Pete.
They tell me Virginia's a great hunting country, too.
What's that? Oh, yeah. Let's play, fellows.
- What's the bet?
- It's up to you, Manch.
Don't they call Virginia the Mother of Presidents?
Yeah. I mean... Bet five.
Up ten.
Thomas Jefferson lived there, too, didn't he?
I drop.
A lot of guys lived there.
Are you sure you never played Seven-Toed Pete before?
Makes it ten to you, Manch.
Have they finally gotten that hookworm situation under control down there?
There never has been a case of hookworm in Virginia.
- I've got a small straight.
- Mine's seven to the jack.
All pink.
Well, that beats. I think I'll turn in.
- Somebody's won a lot of dough.
- A little.
- You just had a run of bad cards, Manch.
- Yeah.
What say we get together again pretty soon?
Oh, sure. See you later.
Say, you haven't got any books on Virginia, have you, Manch?
You Army guys are real pigeons.
I wish you were in the Navy.
You take the bunk, Lawson. I'll sleep here, if you don't mind.
- What's the idea?
- That thing's as soft as a feather bed.
I never could sleep in it.
Yeah. It's not bad. Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Lieutenant Randall is going to tell us something about a carrier takeoff.
Mr. Randall.
From the minute you're in your planes, I'm the man to watch.
Have your engines turning over as soon as the man in front of you starts taxiing.
When I want you to rev up, I'll give you this.
Now, if your engines don't sound right to me,
I may have to keep you revved up longer than you think necessary,
I can hear your engines and tell when they're missing better than you can.
When I want you to start taxiing, I'll give you this.
Now you're in position.
I give you a final rev.
And when I drop it, you're off.
We'll aim you straight for Japan. One more thing.
Once we're lined up for the takeoffs, there can be no delays.
If your plane stalls, if it doesn't start immediately, if you have any trouble of any kind, we won't have time to do anything about it.
The Navy crew has orders to push the ship overboard and make way for the next one.
Lieutenant Jurika has detailed maps and pictures of cities and specified targets.
Mr. Jurika spent a great many years in Japan.
I think it might be a good idea if he gave you some idea of what kind of people you're going to run up against in case you're forced down.
Mr. Jurika.
I was Assistant Naval Attaché at our embassy in Japan, long enough to learn a few things about the Orient.
Just what should we do, Mr. Jurika?
How should we conduct ourselves in case we are forced down over Japan?
My advice is, see that you're not forced down over Japan.
The run I've got figured out for you starts here.
The smokestacks are bright red brick, and you can't miss them.
One of the largest smelters in Japan.
Then, following the line of the bay and allowing 10 seconds between bombs you should take out this and this.
Both of them are machine shops owned by brothers,
I forget their names but I remember I didn't like them.
Then on out here to drop your incendiary.
How does this line up for you, Lawson?
Well, you're going to drop them, Clever.
The run seems all right for me if it's okay for you.
- We can take them out.
- Fine.
Jones, have you got the course laid out for this run?
Yes. Over here, fellows.
Now you'll take off about here. You go due west to Tokyo at minimum cruising speed, flying at about 50 feet.
When you hit the bay, get up to about 1,500 complete your bombing run, then down again and out to sea,
- south by southeast to Yakushima.
- Can we take the maps with us?
All you need.
Be sure there are no marks on them though, which might show the Japs where you came from in case you're captured.
By the way, I'm taking off first with four incendiaries.
That should light up
Tokyo pretty well for you.
Suppose by the time we get to China, the
Japs have taken over the landing field?
The Chinese will arrange a signal for you when you get to the field if the Japs have captured it.
If that's the case you've got to keep right on going until you've run out of gas then bail out and destroy your planes.
Yes.
There's just been a change in the disposition of the barrage balloons over Tokyo.
This balloon and this one were moved this morning to here and here.
You know, the changes in those balloons threw me.
Just think, a bunch of guys sweating all day in a sub down under Tokyo bay, guys just like us sneaking up at night to radio balloon positions.
Just let me hear anybody talk about the Navy again.
Boy, they're good.
Plenty. They're not bad at poker either.
Oh, you're not kidding.
I kind of figured on getting Ellen a present in Chungking, you know, a kimono or something.
But these Navy guys have cleaned me.
Believe it or not, I've only got 14 bucks.
Well, I got $8 or $10 I could let you have.
Oh, no. No. I've been thinking, cigarettes sell for 60 cents a carton on the boat here.
But in Chungking, I hear the boys will pay seven bucks.
Yeah?
So I figure I may load the duck with coffin nails.
Hey, that's an idea.
- It's a good night for subs.
- Yeah.
You know, it's funny.
When I was a kid I used to dream about going someplace on a ship.
Well, here I am.
And out there is Japan.
My mother had a Jap gardener once.
He seemed like a nice little guy.
You know, I don't hate Japs, yet.
It's a funny thing. I don't like them, but I don't hate them.
I guess I don't either.
You get kind of mixed up.
Yeah.
It's hard to figure. Yet here we are.
All I ever wanted to be was an aeronautical engineer.
I joined the Army in '40 because I figured it was the best way to learn.
I wasn't sore at anybody.
But here you suddenly realize you're going to drop a ton of high explosives on one of the biggest cities in the world.
You're not getting squeamish, are you?
Oh, no, of course not.
I don't pretend to like the idea of killing a bunch of people but it's the case of drop a bomb on them or pretty soon they'll be dropping one on Ellen.
Yeah, that's right.
I wonder how many of us will pull through.
Oh, they figure about half.
- And everybody thinks he'll be in that half.
- Yeah.
- When are you going to get married, Bob?
- Oh, when I find somebody like Ellen.
It'd be swell, you know. The four of us.
You know, when this is over I'd like to get me a small ranch.
Something that'd run about
40 or 50 head of cattle.
A nice well and a house.
It'd be wonderful for kids.
I've always been kind of nuts about ranches myself.
You know, in a decent year you can make real dough out of 40 head of cattle, if you've got feed.
- Why don't we do something like that?
- Well, I'm game if you are.
- Okay, it's a deal.
- Good.
Of course, now if we had 80 head of cattle we'd really have ourselves a layout.
- Yeah, and our own meat too.
- Oh, yeah, milk, butter, eggs, the whole works.
You know, a guy who's got himself a place, he doesn't have to worry about anything.
- And with a little hunting near.
- Oh, sure, that's easy.
Gosh, I'll be glad when this war ends.
In the event of an emergency there will be no assembly.
No last minute instructions.
We'll just take off.
If you should develop motor trouble within a half hour after leaving the Hornet, fly back to the ship and land in the water.
The Navy will try to fish you out.
If trouble should develop after that time, you'll have to keep right on going.
Because by that time the fleet will have to fire on any craft overhead.
I don't want you to throw out the extra cans of gas as you use them.
That would leave a perfect trail for the Japs to follow back to the Hornet.
Save the cans and throw them all out at one time.
Now let me repeat something
I've said previously.
You are to bomb the military targets assigned to you and nothing else.
Of course, in an operation of this kind you cannot avoid killing civilians.
Because war plants are manned by civilians.
If any of you have any moral feelings about this necessary killing, if you feel that you might think of yourself afterward as a murderer,
I want you to drop out. We'll find someone to take your place.
And I promise you that no one will blame you for your feelings.
Barring any sudden switch in plans, we'll take off tomorrow night.
There's one thing more.
When we meet in Chungking
I'm going to throw you a party that you can tell your grandchildren about.
You're a great bunch of guys. I'm proud to be associated with you.
Good luck.
- 12 cartons of cigarettes.
- 12 cartons?
Say, what gives with the Army?
I've never sold so many cigarettes in my life.
- We're chain smokers.
- You must eat them. What kind will it be?
Oh, any kind.
- You just want lots of cigarettes.
- You hit it right on the head.
All right.
That'll be $7.20.
Now hear this. Our carrier task force has been sighted by enemy surface vessels.
All Army pilots and crews, man your planes for immediate takeoff.
There goes a Jap just three minutes after we sighted her.
Yeah. That means she had two minutes to tell Tokyo what she saw.
Now hear this. Get all bombs loaded on the double.
- Are you all packed?
- Have been for five days, sir.
Good. Better watch how those guys handle the Duck.
I will, sir.
And don't tell anybody about that bumped turret.
I won't, sir.
- Hey, we're off, aren't we?
- Yeah!
Oh, bomb me, daddy!
I think I've got everything packed.
- Swell, thanks.
- I'm sorry we couldn't have picked out a little better weather for you.
- We'll make it. So long, Felton.
- Give them a pasting they'll never forget.
We will. Look, thanks for everything.
You guys in the Navy, well, you're okay. Be seeing you.
Now hear this. Clear the flight deck to start engines.
Hey, how about my change?
They're giving us fifteen extra cans instead of ten.
Good. At least getting off now will put us over Tokyo in daylight.
Don't forget about the barrage balloons in daylight too.
Oh, next you'll be telling me it's good because you can get better pictures in the daytime.
- You're not kidding about that, either.
- Let's give her a final check.
Hey, Bob.
- What?
- Are you up ahead?
Fourth spot.
See you in Chungking.
You said it, brother.
- How they doing?
- Doolittle will be off any second.
Then Hoover, Holstrom, Gray and Davey Jones, we're seventh.
Seven's a lucky number.
Ted, Ted. Hey, Ted, Ted, hey.
Put these some place, will you?
- What are they?
- Sizzle platters.
I've got the phonograph in my ship.
But I haven't got room for the records.
We'll meet in Chungking and cut a Chinese rug.
Okay, Shorty.
- Take care of these, will you, McClure?
- Right.
- Pilot to gunner.
- Gunner to pilot. Go ahead, sir.
Take a look at the turret if you get a chance.
I've been working on that, sir. She's still jammed.
We'll use the auxiliary power if we have to.
Right, sir.
We've got ourselves in a fine jam, haven't we, Lawson?
Well, this is a great time to think of that.
Oh, no, I mean having to take off ahead of schedule.
Oh, I'm sorry, Davenport. I guess maybe I'm a little on edge.
- Bomb bay clear?
- Bomb bays clear.
- Clear on right?
- Clear on right.
- Clear on left?
- Clear on left.
He made it. He made it.
Get your flaps up.
Hey!
Good luck, fellows. Hand them a couple for the Navy.
- We sure will, Miller.
- And thanks to you.
Wish I were going with you. So long.
- So long.
- So long.
Goodbye, boys.
- Four more ahead of us.
- Let's start the engines.
Let's go.
- Clear on right?
- Clear on right?
Clear on right.
Clear on left?
Clear on left.
Those Navy guys are moving up to push us over.
They're not gonna toss this ship overboard.
Come on, baby. Give.
Give. Give.
Check hydraulic pressure.
- Hydraulic pressure okay.
- Check brake pressure.
Okay.
There goes Bob.
Two more ahead of us.
Check fuel booster.
Hey, Army. Ted!
Give them for me.
When we get to Chungking, we'll tell them it was a Navy show too.
They'll know that when they see how broke you are. Good hunting.
- Bomb bay doors closed.
- Bomb bays closed.
- Pilot to gunner. All set, Thatcher?
- Everything okay, sir.
- Wing flaps down.
- Wing flaps coming down.
There goes Hallmark.
We're taking off, fellows. Happy landings.
Phew!
Yeah.
Both the flaps up.
We didn't even have them down.
How do you like that? I wonder what else we forgot.
Coffee, sandwiches, water, plenty.
Pilot to gunner. Thatcher.
Gunner to pilot. Go ahead, sir.
- You all right, Thatcher?
- Yes, sir.
You'd better get started on those cans.
- We've burned over 40 gallons already.
- Yes, sir.
Well, we're on our way.
If anybody's carrying a rabbit's foot, hang on to it tight.
What's our position, McClure?
I figure about an hour and
58 minutes from the coast.
Get that, Thatcher? We can expect their fighters any time now.
- Keep your eyes open.
- Watching, sir.
There's nothing in sight. Could we try out this turret again?
Okay. Relay switch on.
It works all right, sir, but that emergency power's not going to hold out long if we run into trouble.
Turning it off now.
- How far are we behind our first gang?
- About an hour.
Then we really can get set for trouble.
Yeah, but nothing like what the guys behind us are going to run into.
I'd feel a lot better on a night job.
Did you hear that left engine miss?
No, singing like a lark.
I must be hearing things.
Navigator to pilot.
Pilot to Navigator. Go ahead.
We ought to hit the
Japanese coast any minute.
Look.
- See that flag?
- Yeah.
- Saving bombs today.
- They're waving at us.
Those guys must be nuts.
Japanese coast straight ahead.
Fujiyama.
We'll be catching buckshot any second now.
Zeros.
- Pilot to...
- I saw them, sir.
- Shall I turn the power on for the turret?
- No, wait a minute.
I don't know what happened to them, sir. I guess they didn't see us.
There she is fellows. Take a good gander.
When we get back home, the folks will want to know what
Tokyo used to look like.
That must be Davey Jones giving them the works.
Pilot to bombardier, bomb bay doors open.
- There we are, the big red smokestack.
- Pilot to bombardier,
- approaching smelter.
- I'm on it.
They've got our altitude.
One away.
Two away.
Three away.
Four away.
- Six fighters just above and to the right.
- Have you got them, Thatcher?
Ready for them, sir.
Why don't they dive?
They're going away.
We're not going to wait for them to come back. We're getting out of here.
Well, I guess maybe we're in that lucky half.
Not yet. Not till we get to China.
Wow. What a headache.
- Were you scared?
- I'm still scared.
- McClure, on our course?
- On our course.
A hundred and sixty gallons. I hope it's enough to get us to Changchow.
Yeah, and I hope the Japs don't get there first.
What's the dope, McClure?
About 200 miles to Changchow.
- And we ought to hit the coast any minute.
- We'll never find it in the dark.
Pilot to crew.
We're going up and flying on instruments.
When the gas is gone we'll bail out.
We'll buzz it. Maybe we can land.
Keep a lookout for rocks or logs.
All set for landing.
McClure, get our guns out.
Take off chutes and be sure your life jackets are on. Carry your guns.
Wheels down. Flaps down.
Air speed 135.
I lost my ship.
I lost my ship.
- You hurt bad?
- I don't... I don't know.
I can't move my arms.
Your leg, it's all busted up, sir.
Get Davenport.
Ted, Ted, look at me.
That baby and I...
We won't ever need anything but you.
We mustn't either of us be scared about it, Ted, because the baby, the baby's why
I know you're coming back to us.
Lawson!
Shall I shoot them, Lieutenant?
No, hold it.
- But they may be Japs, sir.
- Don't shoot, Thatcher.
Hey! Hey!
He says he's Chinese. What's that word for American?
That leg's got to be sewn up, sir.
It's split wide open.
Me, Charlie.
Americans.
- We're Americans.
- American.
Americans.
We need a doctor, and some help to get to Changchow.
Chiang Kai-shek.
- We're his friends. In Chungking.
- Chungking!
- Yes.
- That's right.
We go Chungking.
Chungking many, many days. Many.
Doctor. Doctor.
Charlie, go, go doctor.
Charlie, bring doctor here.
Charlie, bring doctor or we die.
Doctor, one li.
One li, that's a Chinese mile.
One li. Go.
Bring doctor.
Doctor, Japanese man. Japanese doctor.
Maybe Japanese man, Japanese soldier, come here.
Japanese man no come at night.
Boat, you go boat.
Let's go.
Hey, cut that out.
I think he wants to trade bullets with you, Thatcher.
Friend.
Charlie, friend.
Charlie, go. Charlie, friend.
Sure, Charlie, friend. Goodbye, Charlie.
The Japs must be all around us.
- I wonder where the rest of the gang is?
- Scattered all over the China coast, if they're alive.
I think I'm going to pass out.
- I, Ted, take you, Ellen.
- To be my lawfully wedded wife.
To be my lawfully wedded wife.
- To have and to cherish.
- To have and to cherish.
Until death us do part.
Until death us do part.
Until death us do part.
Until death us do part.
Don't let them cut my leg off.
Please, don't let them cut my leg off.
- Don't let them cut my leg off.
- Lawson, stop it. Lawson.
- Don't.
- Lawson.
- What's the matter?
- You were yelling.
Thank you.
My name is Foo Ling.
Everything we have is yours.
We know what you have done and we honor you for it.
Our navigator has both his shoulders broken.
Is there anybody who can set them for him?
No one.
But we hope that help will soon arrive for you.
Thanks.
How are they?
We have washed them. They are bandaged.
But we have no medicines.
Not even aspirin.
What's that?
- This is Dr. Chung.
- How do you do?
We've come a long way and we're going home now and we've been hunting a doctor everywhere.
I understand.
Have you got anything that'll knock them out, Doctor? They're in awful pain.
We hope to have some medical supplies by the time we reach my father's hospital.
Hospital? Where's that?
In Lin Hai. About 60 li from here.
- I have come to take you there.
- It's a funny thing, Doctor.
There were a lot of planes and we had to take off early.
- You see how it was.
- Of course.
They aren't in any shape to make much of a trip, Doctor.
We'll have to move them at once.
The Japanese captured one of your crews yesterday, not very far from here.
So many planes, and we don't know what happened to the others.
All up and down the Chinese Coast.
My countrymen are seeking your countrymen.
We'll bring them through.
I have some money. I want to give it to you.
Please, Lieutenant, you have given us enough already.
- What?
- The bombs you dropped on Japan.
Please, now try to rest.
The Japanese, they are in the village we just left.
- Chan.
- Mr. Parker.
- Mrs. Parker.
- Doctor Chan.
- How are they?
- They are very, very sick.
- I'll need your help.
- How close are the Japanese?
They took Ching Ming three hours after our departure.
One of the American crews has already fallen into their hands.
Hadn't they better be taken straight through to Hop Sai?
They couldn't stand the trip.
This is my father, Dr. Chung.
- The others, please, help them.
- Please, don't worry, Lieutenant.
We'll take care of everybody.
You won't have to take it off, will you, Doc?
We hope not. One cannot tell.
You've had a long journey. Now you must rest.
All we had at our Mission was a little antiseptic fluid and some bandages.
But we've sent out runners for supplies.
Is there any way I could get a message out?
I'd like my mother to know that I'm okay.
The whole region's swarming with Japanese.
Well, do you think they've heard back in the States what happened to us?
We've been listening in on short wave. They know all about the raid, but apparently they're keeping the details secret until the rest of your men have been saved.
Have they found any of the others?
We have word that one crew will be coming through here pretty soon now.
I understand there's a doctor among them.
Oh, that must be Lieutenant
Smith's crew. Excuse me.
Lieutenant Smith's crew has been rescued, sir.
Smith's?
They found Lieutenant Smith and
Doc White and they're coming here.
Don Smith's crew. The Doc was flying with Don Smith.
They'll be here any minute now.
It's funny, isn't it?
I mean the way Clever's head just keeps rocking back and forth, back and forth.
Somebody ought to help Clever.
I think the Chinese are a swell bunch of people but I can't say I go for their music.
Shorty Manch would go all to pieces if he heard a little of this.
Yeah.
How's Lawson?
Well, his leg looks pretty bad, sir.
Dr. Chung thinks gangrene has set in.
Looks like a Jap Zero.
You guys ought to go on and leave me.
They think I'm passed out half the time and I hear what they say.
The Japs are coming closer all the time. Why don't you guys go?
We're not sticking around here because of you, Lawson.
- None of us here are able to travel yet.
- I was just thinking.
I guess Ellen and I aren't going to ski anymore.
That's too bad.
I was going to teach her some fancy stuff.
Now don't start talking like that.
You're going to pull through all right.
What do you think a girl would do?
I mean, say Ellen and I like to ski.
Be kind of funny if they cut my leg off, wouldn't it?
Why don't you try to go to sleep?
Yeah, it'd be kind of funny, all right.
You marry a guy, he's got two arms and two legs.
Then he comes back and he hasn't any.
- I am Dr. Chung.
- Where are the boys?
How are you, Pop?
Did you have a good trip?
- Here they are.
- Hi, fellas.
- How are you?
- How you doing?
- Hello, Sarge.
- It's good to see you.
- Holy Joe, what happened to you guys?
- Nothing serious.
The Duck forgot to duck.
Yeah, McClure's been trying to do his own flying ever since.
This really looks like something left over from a massacre.
Well, you guys don't look so good yourselves.
You don't smell so good either.
Well, there's nothing wrong with us that a good bath won't fix.
- I wish we could say the same for you.
- How's the grub around here?
I think I'd like a good thick steak, French fried onions and a baked potato with plenty of butter and about three bottles of beer...
You'll take bean sprouts and like them.
- Say, where's Lawson and Davenport?
- They're upstairs.
- Lawson's in pretty bad shape.
- You better go up and see him.
He needs you bad, Doc.
Well, it's certainly good to see you fellows again.
Hey, Pop, how's the chop suey around here?
He doesn't speak English.
I'm sorry, Pop.
Yeah, and when Shorty jumped, he had two. 45s, a. 44 rifle, a. 22 automatic, that Luger of his, a hunting knife, a Bowie knife
- and an ax.
- What a guy.
He stuffed his shirt full of chocolate bars but he forgot to button his collar.
So when he pulled the rip cord, he just naturally molted candy all over North China.
- What happened to his photograph?
- It went down with the ship.
Next morning Manch scared the
Chinese right out of their wits.
They didn't know anything human grew that tall.
What about Bob Gray?
He's okay. I think they moved on to Chungking.
Oh, yeah, and that guy "Me,
Charlie" said to tell you hello.
If it hadn't been for Charlie, the
Japs would have had us that first day.
Yeah, us too.
I'd like to come back some day and fight alongside that guy.
Me, too.
Well, it's all over.
Let's save some of this talk for tomorrow.
A pint and a half, that's not bad.
You'd better get to bed now.
You're an old grandma, Doc.
But I'll take it slow, just as a favor to you.
Be seeing you, Lawson.
Thanks, Doc.
How's the leg, Doc?
It's not good, Lawson.
The next forty-eight hours will tell the story.
Well, thank you.
- Hey, Don.
- Yeah?
Tell Doolittle to hold off that party till we get there.
Okay, Davenport. We'll wait for you.
- Where's Thatcher?
- He's in with Lawson. He'll be right out.
Okay.
I wish you would let me stay here until you're ready to go, sir.
These people will take care of us.
There's no reason for you fellows to hang around and maybe get caught.
Yeah, I know, but I might come in handy if the Japs show up, sir.
Thatcher, when you get back to the States, if you should run into my wife, just tell her I'm okay.
Don't let her know about anything being wrong.
I understand, sir.
And say hello for me to that girl in Billings.
That I will, sir.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Thatcher.
Good morning.
- Good morning, Lawson.
- Hi, Doc.
I'll try not to hurt you,
Lawson. I'll have a look at this.
Thanks.
You going to take the leg, Doc?
Yeah, I think so.
We talked it over and there's nothing else to do.
It's pretty rough to have to cut a man's leg off.
I guess it'll be all right.
After all, a wooden leg is just kind of like wearing a shoe with a high instep.
When are you gonna do it?
I might as well give you a shot right now.
You mean we have something to knock me out?
Our runners arrived with anesthetic this morning.
It'll only be a spinal, Lawson.
You won't feel anything from the waist down, but you'll be conscious.
That's the best we can do.
Oh, swell.
I can watch you and make sure you don't take off too much.
All right, Lawson. We'll have to roll you over.
It'll take a little time to work.
We'll get you over to the operating room.
- Doc?
- Yes?
- How high are you going to cut?
- Oh, not too high.
- Will I have a knee, Doc?
- I'm afraid not, Lawson.
- Any feeling there?
- No. Look, Doc.
We can't waste any time, Lawson.
When that anesthetic wears off,
- we haven't got any more.
- Okay, but just one thing more.
Yes.
If anything happens, don't let Ellen know anything about the operation.
She might just as well think
I died while all in one piece.
All right, Lawson. Now, you're not going to feel this.
But you might get nervous and jump or something, so the nurses are going to hold you.
Okay, Doc.
Fire away.
Oh, when you said "no knee," you weren't kidding.
If I cut any lower we might have to do it again and your system couldn't take it.
What're you stalling for, Doc?
We're doing the best we can, Lawson. Take it easy.
Okay. Only hurry.
It seems like I'm beginning to feel my other leg.
It seems like I can move my toes, Doc.
I think I can move my ankle.
Hurry, Doc, I'm sure I can.
Hurry, Doc, hurry.
- Hello.
- Hello. Hello, Ellen?
- Ted, where are you?
- I'm in a lumber camp.
I had to make a forced landing in a mud puddle.
- You aren't hurt, are you?
- No, not a scratch.
- Have you got the tree all fixed?
- Oh, yes, Ted. You should just see it.
- It's so beautiful.
- Anything under it?
- Oh, yes.
- Well, let's open them up.
- Oh, we can't do that.
- Sure we can. Go ahead.
Well, if you say so.
I'm not going to be cheated out of my Christmas by a cracked up airplane.
Oh, Ted, it's the most beautiful
box of candy I've ever seen in my whole life.
Good. Isn't there maybe something else lying around?
- Let me see. Yes, there is.
- Well, open it.
It's a silk scarf. And it looks like it's handmade, too.
- I'll bet it's got my initials on it.
- That's not fair.
You peeked while I was making it.
I just know my wife.
- Oh, Ted, I wish you were here.
- So do I, honey.
I'll be thinking of you tonight.
I'll sit in front of the tree and turn the radio on to Christmas carols
and just think of you.
Thank you. And thank you, scouts.
I mean, all the fellows would like to thank you very much, for everything.
Lieutenant, my father has asked me to present this to you.
It has been in our family since the fifteenth century.
Father begs me to tell you that beauty belongs to beauty, and asks that you honor him by presenting it to your wife.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
I didn't know that you knew about Ellen, my wife.
You spoke of her a number of times.
It says, "This is an American hero who has bombed Japan.
"Whenever he goes among the people of China,
"let him be accorded respect and honor. "
He has just come from Kow Chai.
Another one of your crews has been captured and the Japanese are moving in this direction.
I think Lawson will be able to travel in a couple of days.
There's nothing wrong with me,
Doc. I can travel right now.
I'm afraid a couple of days will be too long.
This is Wang Tsung.
He has walked all the way from his native village of Kow Chai.
And he begs the honor of presenting gifts to his American Allies.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
He felt a lot worse than I did.
There, I can get along pretty well already.
I should say very well for your first day out of bed.
I guess, I'll have to be a little more careful.
I don't ever want anybody to see me do that.
I don't want anybody to see me till I get a new leg.
Lieutenant White, word just came.
The American plane will pick you up in
Changchow tomorrow afternoon at 5:00.
Wonderful.
He says if we don't hurry, the
Japanese may get there first.
- When are you leaving?
- We're going to stay here.
We're quite used to it, you know.
- Here. This may come in handy.
- Thank you.
You and Mr. Parker have done so much for us, and we'll never forget it.
- Goodbye, Lawson.
- Goodbye.
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.
- Goodbye. God bless you.
- Goodbye. Thank you.
My father wishes me to tell you that you have honored us with your visit and that he will offer prayers for your safe return to America.
Isn't he coming along with us?
Father feels that he must stay with his people.
They will need him here.
Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye, Doctor.
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye, Doc, and thanks for everything.
- I hope, sir, that we may meet again.
That goes double, Doc.
Goodbye, Doctor, and thank you.
Thank you.
If you ever come to the States,
Doctor, look me up, will you?
I'll be in the Portland telephone directory.
- With pleasure.
- Goodbye, Doctor.
I have one sorrow, Lieutenant, that we did not have the medicine to ease your pain.
- You saved my life, Doc.
- I hope someday you will come back to us.
We'll be back, maybe not us ourselves but a lot of guys like us.
And I'd like to be with them.
- Because you're our kind of people.
- Thank you, sir, and goodbye.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Go ahead, sit down.
- Thank you.
I know how you feel. Take it for a while.
Thanks.
Smell that?
That's America. That's the USA.
Every time I make a trip back, she smells better and better.
Yeah.
- I think I know what you mean.
- I'm from Pittsburgh.
I know it may seem screwy to you, but it seems to me as if I can smell some of that coal smoke right off the old Monongahela
River. That sound crazy?
No. I'm from California and
I can smell orange blossoms.
Oh, it couldn't be, that's too far. It must come from Florida.
Oh, if you want flavor, you've got to have a California orange, but for smelling, Florida's just as good.
Hello. Yes.
What's that?
- Just a minute. Ellen.
- Yes?
Ellen, Washington on the phone.
Hello?
Yes, this is Mrs. Lawson.
Hello, Colonel. I mean General Doolittle.
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thank you.
No, not a bit excited, General.
Oh, he's back, Mother. Ted's back. He's back.
Oh yes, General, how is he?
Oh, yes.
I understand.
Of course, I do.
Yes, I'll be ready.
I know, I know.
Oh, that's so nice of you, General.
Yes, thank you. Oh, yes, thank you, General.
Thank you.
Just cry, darling.
Cry it out.
He got in this morning, Mother.
General Doolittle just saw him, so it's true.
General Doolittle's sending a plane ticket for me.
Ted doesn't want to see me.
He doesn't want to see me because he's lost his leg and he doesn't even want me to know it's happened till he gets a new leg and learns how to use it.
As if it would make any difference.
As if anything would make any difference to me as long as he's alive.
Oh, I'm going to see him, I'm going to see him.
Well, that means we have to get your clothes ready in a hurry.
Have my things come back from the cleaners yet?
Let's see, I'll take this suit.
And my blue coat. He always liked it best.
I can't take any of these things. I can't take any of my pretty clothes.
They don't fit me anymore.
Do you think Ted's going to pay any attention to what kind of clothes you wear or how you look?
He always did.
Oh, Mother, I'm scared.
There's nothing to be frightened about.
Lots of people lose a leg or arm
- and continue living perfectly normal lives.
- I'm not scared about Ted.
- I'm scared about me.
- About you?
Well, you see, most husbands and wives are together while things are changing.
Husbands get used to things like that because, well, they're around.
Ted's been gone all this time and when he went away, I was so slim.
All the time he's been gone, he's been thinking of me like that.
Ted loves you Ellen, and you love him.
That's why neither of you is going to notice any change when you meet.
- Do you think so, Mother?
- I know so.
All the same, if I held my coat like this when I walk into the room, don't you think it would hide me, just a little?
Hello, Lawson. How're you feeling?
- Pretty good, sir.
- You look fine.
Thank you, sir.
- Won't you sit down, sir?
- Yeah, thanks.
- Well, got any plans?
- About what, sir?
Well, about the future. Have you decided what you're going to do?
Not particularly, sir.
I always wanted to be an aeronautical engineer.
I suppose I'll start studying again after they muster me out.
Who said they'd muster you out?
Well, I won't be much use to anybody with a...
What are you talking about?
Do you think we'd let a man of your experience get away from us?
- Well, that's fine, sir. Thank you.
- Don't thank me.
I just happened to think of something, Lawson.
Yes, sir?
What about your wife?
Does she knew you're back?
- No, sir.
- Why not?
Well, I thought I'd wait till I get my new leg and my scars fixed up.
It won't be so much of a shock to her that way.
Shock? What kind of a girl did you marry, anyway?
She's okay, sir. She's a fine girl.
Well then, she deserves to know.
She deserves to see you too.
No, no, sir. If you don't mind, I'd rather wait.
When I see Ellen again, I'm going to be all dressed up and have a new leg.
And I'm going to take her out to the best place in town and I'm going to dance with her.
- That may be quite a while, Lawson.
- No, sir.
You see, I'm getting along fine. And in a month or two...
In a month or two you'll be back at work, hard work.
Well, I'll try to drop in on you again, Lawson.
- I hope you can, sir.
- Goodbye.
Goodbye, sir.
Your wife's going to have a baby, isn't she?
Yes, sir.
I've got a couple of kids myself, both in the service.
You know, Lawson, if my kids and all the other kids who are in this thing could fix it so this would really be the last one, your kid would get quite a break, wouldn't he?
He sure would, sir.
I just had to come.
Ted, Ted, Ted. Let me help you.
Don't, Ellen. You'll hurt the baby.
When things were worst, when there didn't seem to be any chance at all,
I could see your face, your beautiful face.
I knew you were coming home, Ted.
Tell me, honey.
How come you're so cute?
I had to be if I was going to get such a good looking fellow.
English
By Apis, Persian, thy gods are good to thee.
Try yet again, O captain.
Double or quits!
No more. I am not in the vein.
Captain, a stranger approaches.
Stand. Who goes there?
The bearer of evil tidings.
Pass him in.
Who art thou that laughest in the House of Cleopatra the Queen, and in the teeth of Belzanor, the captain of her guard?
I am Bel Affris, descended from the gods.
Hail, cousin!
Hail, cousin!
All the Queen's guards are descended from the gods, save myself.
I am a Persian, descended from many kings.
Hail, cousins!
Hail, mortal!
You have been in battle, Bel Affris; and you are a soldier among soldiers.
You will not let the Queen's women have the first of your tidings.
I have no tidings, except that we shall all have our throats cut presently, women, soldiers, and all.
I thought so.
Tell us what befell.
Ay, tell us, tell us.
Know then that I serve in a guard in the temple of Ra, here in Memphis.
We went to Alexandria to inquire of king Ptolemy, how we of Egypt do with a Roman, Pompey newly come to our shores after his defeat by Caesar at Pharsalia.
Caesar defeated Pompey?
Does Roman, then, fight Roman?
Even as egyptian fights egyptian.
What did you learn from the Queen's brother Ptolemy, a pretender?
We learned that Caesar is coming also in hot pursuit of his foe, and that Ptolemy has slain Pompey.
Nay, more: we found that Caesar is already come; for we had not made half a day's journey on our way back when we came upon a city rabble flying from his legions.
And ye, the temple guard!
Did you not withstand these legions?
What man could, that we did.
But this Caesar throws a legion at you where you are weakest, as he throws a stone from a catapult.
And that legion is as a man with one head and thousand arms and no religion,
I have fought against them, and I know.
Were you  frightened, cousin?
No cousin, but I was beaten.
Could you not die?
There was no time.
All was over in a moment.
But now I am come to warn you that you must open your gates to Caesar; for his advance guard is scarce an hour behind me; and there is not an Egyptian warrior left standing between you and his legions.
Woe, alas!
Nail him to the door, quick!
Now this news will run through the palace like fire through stubble.
What shall we do to save the women from the Romans?
Why not kill them?
Because we should have to pay blood money.
Better let the Romans kill them: it is cheaper.
O subtle one! O serpent!
But your Queen?
True: we must carry off Cleopatra.
I will take her on the crupper of my horse.
Fly, fly!
What's the matter now?
The sacred white cat has been stolen!
Hail, Sphinx: salutation from Julius Caesar!
I have wandered in many lands, seeking the lost region from which my birth into this world exiled me, and the company of creatures such as I myself.
I found flocks and pastures, men and cities, but no other Caesar, no air native to me, no man kindred to me, none who can do my day's deed, and think my night's thought.
In the little world yonder, Sphinx, my place is as high as yours in this great desert; only I wander, and you sit still; I conquer, and you endure; I work and wonder, you watch and wait;
Sphinx, you and I, strangers to the race of men, are no strangers to one another: have I not been conscious of you and of this place since I was born?
Rome is a madman's dream: this is my Reality.
My way hither was the way of destiny; for I am he of whose genius you are the symbol: part brute, part woman, and part God-- nothing of man in me at all.
Have I read your riddle, Sphinx?
Old gentleman.
Immortal gods!
Old gentleman: don't run away.
Old gentleman: don't run away!!!
This! To Julius Caesar!
Old gentleman.
Sphinx: you presume on your centuries.
I am younger than you, though your voice is but a girl's voice as yet.
Climb up here, quickly; or the Romans will come and eat you.
A child at its breast! A divine child!
Come up quickly.
You must get up at its side and creep round.
Who are you?
Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt.
Queen of the Gypsies, you mean.
You must not be disrespectful to me, or the Sphinx will let the Romans eat you.
Come up. It is quite cosy here.
What a dream!
What a magnificent dream!
Only let me not wake,
Take care.
That's right. Now sit down: you may have its other paw.
It is very powerful and will protect us; but it would not take any notice of me or keep me company.
I am glad you have come: I was very lonely.
Did you happen to see a white cat anywhere?
Have you lost one?
Yes: the sacred white cat: isn't it dreadful?
I brought him here to sacrifice him to the Sphinx; but when we got a little way from the city a black cat called him, and he jumped out of my arms and ran away to it.
Do you think that the black cat can have been my great-great-great-grandmother?
Your great-great-great-grandmother!
Well, why not?
Nothing would surprise me on this night of nights.
I think it must have been.
My great-grandmother's great-grandmother was a black kitten of the sacred white cat; and my blood is made with Nile water.
That is why my hair is so wavy.
What are you doing here at this time of night?
Do you live here?
Of course not:
I am the Queen; and I shall live in the palace at Alexandria when I have killed my brother, who drove me out of it.
When I am old enough I shall do just what I like.
I shall be able to poison the slaves and see them wriggle, and pretend to Ftatateeta, my nurse, that she is going to be put into the fiery furnace.
Hm! Meanwhile why are you not at home and in bed?
Because the Romans are coming to eat us all.
YOU are not at home and in bed either.
Yes I am.
I live in a tent; and I am now in that tent, fast asleep and dreaming.
Do you suppose that I believe you are real, you impossible little dream witch?
You are a funny old gentleman. I like you.
Ah, that spoils the dream.
Why don't you dream that I am young?
I wish you were; only I think I should be more afraid of you.
I like men, especially young men with round strong arms; but I am afraid of them.
You are old and rather wrinkly; but you have a nice voice; and I like to have somebody to talk to, though I think you are a little mad.
It is the moon that makes you talk to yourself in that silly way.
What! you heard that, did you?
I was saying my prayers to the great Sphinx.
But this isn't the great Sphinx.
What!
This is only a dear little kitten of the Sphinx.
Why, the great Sphinx is so big that it has a temple between its paws.
This is my pet Sphinx.
Tell me: do you think the Romans have any sorcerers who could take us away from the Sphinx by magic?
Why? Are you afraid of the Romans?
Oh, they would eat us if they caught us.
They are barbarians.
Their chief is called Julius Caesar.
His father was a tiger and his mother a burning mountain; and his nose is like an elephant's trunk.
They all have long noses, and ivory tusks, and little tails, and seven arms with a hundred arrows in each; and they live on human flesh.
Would you like me to show you a real Roman?
No. You are frightening me.
No matter: this is only a dream--
It is not a dream: it is not a dream. See, see.
How dare you?
You said you were dreaming.
I only wanted to show you--
Come, come: don't cry.
A Queen mustn't cry.
Cleopatra: can you see my face well?
Yes.
It is so white in the moonlight.
Are you sure it is the moonlight that makes me look whiter than an Egyptian?
Do you notice that I have a rather long nose?
It is a Roman nose, Cleopatra.
Bite him in two, Sphinx: bite him in two.
I meant to sacrifice the white ca--I did indeed--I--Ah!
Cleopatra: shall I show you a way to prevent Caesar from eating you?
Oh do, do, do.
I will steal a crown jewel and give them to you.
I will make the river Nile water your lands twice a year.
My child. Your gods are afraid of the Romans: you see the Sphinx dare not bite me, nor prevent me carrying you off to Julius Caesar.
You won't, you won't. You said you wouldn't.
Caesar never eats women.
But he eats girls and cats.
Now you are a silly little girl; and you are descended from the black kitten.
You are both a girl and a cat.
And will he eat me?
Yes; unless you make him believe that you are a woman.
Oh, you must get a sorcerer to make a woman of me.
Are you a sorcerer?
Perhaps.
But it will take a long time; and this very night you in the palace of your fathers you must stand face to face with Caesar
No, no. I daren't.
Whatever dread may be in your soul-- however terrible Caesar may be to you-- you must confront him as a brave woman and a great Queen; and you must feel no fear.
If your hand shakes: if your voice quavers; then--night and death!
But if he thinks you worthy to rule, he will set you on the throne by his side and make you the real ruler of Egypt.
No: he will find me out: he will find me out.
He is easily deceived by women.
Their eyes dazzle him;
Then we will cheat him.
If you do that he will eat you at one mouthful.
Oh, no, no. Please. I will be good.
I will do whatever you tell me.
I will be your slave.
Hark!
What was that?
Caesar's voice.
Let us run away. Come. Oh, come.
You are safe with me until you stand on your throne to receive Caesar.
Lead me to your palace in the desert.
I will, I will. Oh, come, come, come: the gods are angry. Do you feel the earth shaking?
It is the tread of Caesar's legions.
This way, quickly. And let us look for the white cat as we go.
It is he that has turned you into a Roman.
Incorrigible, oh, incorrigible!
Come, come.
Ftatateeta!
What place is this?
This is where I sit on the throne when I am allowed to wear my crown and robes.
Ftatateeta!
Order the slave to light the lamps.
Do you think I may?
Of course.
You are the Queen. Go on.
Light all the lamps.
Stop.
Who is this you have with you; and how dare you order the lamps to be lighted without my permission?
Who is she?
Ftatateeta.
Chief nurse to--
I speak to the Queen. Be silent.
Is this how your servants know their places?
Send her away; and you do as the Queen has bidden.
You are the Queen: send her away.
Ftatateeta, dear: you must go away--just for a little.
You are not commanding her to go away: you are begging her.
You are no Queen. You will be eaten. Farewell.
No, no, no. Don't leave me.
A Roman does not stay with queens who are afraid of their slaves.
I am not afraid. Indeed I am not afraid.
We shall see who is afraid here.
Cleopatra--
On your knees, woman: am I also a child that you dare trifle with me?
Slave.
Can you cut off a head?
Yes.
Have you remembered yourself, mistress?
O Queen, forget not thy servant in the days of thy greatness.
Go.
Begone.
Go away.
Give me something to beat her with.
You scratch, kitten, do you?
I will beat somebody.
I will beat him.
There, there, there!
I am a Queen at last-- a real, real Queen!
Cleopatra the Queen!
Oh, I love you for making me a Queen.
But queens love only kings.
I will make all the men I love kings.
I will have many young kings, with round, strong arms; and when I am tired of them
I will whip them to death; but you will always be my king: my nice, kind, wise, good old king.
Oh, my wrinkles! You will be the most dangerous of all Caesar's conguests.
Caesar!
I forgot Caesar.
You will tell him that I am a Queen, will you not? a real Queen.
Listen! let us run away and hide until Caesar is gone.
If you fear Caesar, you are no true Queen; and though you were to hide beneath a pyramid, he would go straight to it and lift it with one hand. And then--!
Be afraid if you dare.
Caesar approaches the palace of Cleopatra.
Come: take your place.
Ho, there, Teetatota.
How do you call your slaves?
Clap your hands.
Totateeta, bring the Queen's robes, and her crown, and her women; and prepare her.
Yes, the Crown, Ftatateeta: I shall wear the crown.
For whom must the Queen put on her state?
For a citizen of Rome. A king of kings.
How dare you ask questions?
Go and do as you are told.
Of all the Queen's women, these two alone are left.
The rest are fled.
Two is enough.
Poor Caesar generally has to dress himself.
The Queen of Egypt is not a Roman barbarian.
Be brave, my nursling.
Hold up your head before this stranger.
Are you trembling?
No, I--
I.
You must tell Caesar that I am a Queen.
He will not ask me.
He will know Cleopatra by her pride, her courage, her majesty, and her beauty.
Is it sweet or bitter to be a Queen, Cleopatra?
Bitter.
Cast out fear; and you will conquer Caesar.
Halt! Forward, sentinel!
Fly, fly, fly. The Romans are in the courtyard.
The Romans are in the courtyard.
The Queen must face Caesar alone.
Answer "So be it."
So be it.
Good.
A-a-a!
You are my nursling.
You have said "So be it"; and if you die for it, you must make the Queen's word good.
Forward! March!
Now, if you quail--!
Hail Caesar!
Hail Caesar!
Aah!
Ripe figs!
Fresh mackerel!
Fresh mackerel!
The Romans, the Romans,
They're coming!
They're coming!
What are you running away from?
My children!
The Romans will not eat you.
They are as civilized as you are.
Halt!
Attention!
We wait here for a second in command-Rufio.
This city is Alexandria.
Remember that-Alexandria: the capital of Egypt.
You've got to behave yourselves here.
Be stiffish with the men but you may fraternize with the women.
Silence!
Silence, I tell you!
That is Rufio.
Attention!
Half turn left!
Centurion!
Sir!
See that building. That's the royal palace.
Caesar in there, I am going now to join him.
Keep a platoon of picked men within call, they may be wanted.
Picked men, you understand.
Yes sir.
What are these Romans?
Peasants, brought up to scare crows, sons of  smiths, millers and tanners.
And are we not nobles consecrated to arms, descended from gods?
Gods are not always good to their poor relations
O subtle one! O serpent!
Sixteen, eighteen, twenty four ...
Let us wait and take sides with a winner.
Ptolemy.
Cleopatra.
Cleopatra or ... Ptolemy.
The King of Egypt has a word to speak.
Peace for the King's word!
Take notice of this all of you.
I am the firstborn son of Auletes the Flute Blower who was your King.
My sister Berenice drove him from his throne and reigned in his stead but-- but-- the gods would not suffer--
Yes--the gods would not suffer--
Gods--
I forget what the gods would not suffer.
The King wished to say that the gods would not suffer the impiety of his sister to go unpunished.
Yes, yes: I remember the rest of it.
Therefore the gods sent a stranger, one Mark Antony, a Roman captain of horsemen, across the sands of the desert and he set my father again upon the throne.
Now...
And now that my father is dead, my sister Cleopatra, would snatch the kingdom from me and reign in my place.
But the gods would not suffer will not maintain
Oh yes--will not maintain such iniquity,
But with the help of the witch Ftatateeta she hath cast a spell on the Roman Julius Caesar to uphold her false pretence to rule Egypt.
Take notice then that I will not suffer--
What is it that I will not suffer now?
The King will not suffer a foreigner to take from him the throne of our Egypt.
Tell the King, Achillas, how many soldiers and horsemen follow Julius Caesar?
But two Roman legions, O King.
Three thousand soldiers and scarce a thousand horsemen.
Peace, ho!
Caesar approaches.
The King permits the Roman commander to enter!
Which is the King?
The man or the boy?
I am Pothinus, the guardian of my lord the King.
So you are the King.
Dull work at your age, eh? your servant, Pothinus.
And this gentleman?
Achillas, the King's general.
A general, eh?
I am a general myself.
But I began too old.
Health and many victories, Achillas!
As the gods will, Caesar.
And you, sir, are--?
Theodotus, the King's tutor.
So, you teach men how to be kings, Theodotus.
That is very clever of you.
And this place?
The council chamber of the chancellors of the King's treasury, Caesar.
Ah! That reminds me. I want some money.
The King's treasury is poor, Caesar.
Yes: I notice that there is but one chair in it.
Bring a chair there, some of you, for Caesar.
Caesar--
No, no, my boy: that is your chair of state.
Sit down.
Sit down!
A chair for Caesar!
Sacrilege!
Sit on that, Caesar.
Ah, I forgot. I have not made my companions known here. Pothinus:
This gentleman is Rufio, my comrade in arms. this is Britannus, my secretary.
How do you do.
He is an islander from the western end of the world
Caesar, the tax returns.
A surplus as you predicted.
Now, Pothinus, to business.
I want 16000 talents.
Impossible.
There is not so much money in the King's treasury.
The Royal taxes have not been collected for a whole year.
O, yes they have, Pothinus.
My officers have been collecting them all morning.
Is it possible that Caesar, the conqueror of the world, has time to occupy himself with such a trifle as our taxes?
My friend: taxes are the chief business of a conqueror of the world.
You must pay, Pothinus.
But in return for your bounty, I will settle this dispute about the throne for you, if you will.
You say the matter has been at issue for a year.
May I have ten minutes at it?
You will do as you please, doubtless.
Good! But first, let us have Cleopatra here.
Cleopatra? She is not in Alexandria.
I think she is.
Call Totateeta.
Ho there,
Teetatota.
Who pronounces the name of Ftatateeta, the Queen's chief nurse?
Nobody can pronounce it, Tota, except yourself.
Where is your mistress?
Will the Queen favor us with her presence for a moment?
Am I to behave like a Queen?
Yes.
You may go, Ftatateeta.
Caesar: this is how she treats me always.
If I am a King why is she allowed to take everything from me?
You are not to be King, you little cry-baby.
You are to be eaten by the Romans.
Come here, my boy, and stand by me.
Take your throne: I don't want it.
Go this instant and sit down in your place.
Go, Ptolemy.
Always take a throne when it is offered to you.
Now, Pothinus--
Are you not going to speak to me?
Be quiet.
Open your mouth again before
I give you leave; and you shall be eaten.
I am not afraid.
A queen must not be afraid.
Eat my husband there, if you like: he is afraid.
Your husband! What do you mean?
That little thing.
Husband!
Caesar: you are a stranger here, and do not know our laws.
The kings and queens of Egypt may not marry except with their own royal blood.
Ptolemy and Cleopatra are born king and consort just as they are born brother and sister.
Caesar: this is not proper.
Not proper?
I say it is a scandal.
Scandal or not, my friend, it opens the gate of peace.
Hear what I propose.
Hear Caesar there.
Ptolemy and Cleopatra shall reign jointly in Egypt.
Peace with honor, Pothinus.
What conceit!
Roman trick!
We will not have it!
Caesar: be honest.
The money you demand is the price of our freedom.
Take it; and leave us to settle our own affairs.
Yes, go back to your own country.
Egypt belongs to us, not to you.
Egypt for the Egyptians!
Egypt for the Egyptians!
Egypt for the Egyptians!
Do you forget that there is a Roman army of occupation here, left by Aulus Gabinius when he set up your toy king for you?
And now under my command.
I am the Roman general here, Caesar.
And also the Egyptian general, eh?
That is so, Caesar.
So you can make war on the Egyptians in the name of Rome and on the Romans--on me, if necessary--in the name of Egypt?
That is so, Caesar.
And which side are you on at present, if I may presume to ask, general?
On the side of the right and of the gods.
Hm! How many men have you?
That will appear when I take the field.
Are your men Romans?
If not, it matters not how many there are.
- Insolence!
- We shall see, my friend.
It is useless to try to bluff us, Rufio.
Caesar has been defeated before and he may be defeated again.
What can you do with 4,000 men?
And without money?
Away with you.
Go back to your den.
Caesar, why do you let them talk to you like that ?
Are you afraid?
Why, my dear, what they say is quite true.
But if you go away, I shall not be Queen.
I shall not go away until you are Queen.
Achillas: if you are not a fool, you will take that girl whilst she is under your hand.
Why not take Caesar as well, Achillas?
Well said, Rufio. Why not?
Try, Achillas, try.
Yes, Caesar too.
Guards! Guards there!
Peace, egyptians.
You are Caesar's prisoners, all of you.
Oh no, no, no. By no means.
Caesar's guests, gentlemen, Caesar's guests.
Won't you cut their heads off?
Cut off your brother's head?
Why not?
He would cut off mine, if he got the chance.
Wouldn't you, Ptolemy?
I would. I will, too, when I grow up.
Caesar: if you attempt to detain us--
He will succeed, Egyptian: make up your mind to that.
The road to Rome is open; and you shall travel it if Caesar chooses.
I could do no less, Pothinus, to secure the retreat of my own soldiers.
I am accountable for every life among them.
I am the King's guardian.
I stand on my right here.
Where is your right?
It is in the Rufio's scabbard, my friend.
I may not be able keeping it there much longer.
And this is Roman justice?
But not Roman gratitude, I hope.
Is Caesar's life of so little account to him that he forgets we have saved it.
My life, is that all?
Your life, your laurels, your future.
I can call a witness to prove that but for us
Roman army of occupation, led by Pompey, the greatest soldier in the world would now have Caesar at its mercy.
Ho, there, Lucius Septimius come forth and testify before Caesar.
No, no.
Yes, I say.
Let the military tribune bear witness.
Lucius Septimius!
Bear witness, Lucius Septimius!
Caesar came to Egypt in pursuit of his foe.
Did we shelter his foe?
As Pompey's foot touched the Egyptian shore, his head fell by the stroke of my sword.
We have given you a full and sweet measure of vengeance.
Vengeance!
Oh, if I could stoop to vengeance, what would I not exact from you as the price of this murdered man's blood.
Was he not my son-in-law, my ancient friend,
Am I Julius Caesar, or am I a wild beast, that you fling to me the grey head of the old soldier, the laurelled conqueror, and then claim my gratitude for it!
Begone: you fill me with horror.
Pshaw! You have seen severed heads before, Caesar, and severed right hands too, I think; some thousands of them, after you vanquished the king of the Gauls.
Did you spare him, with all your clemency?
Was that vengeance?
Would that it had been!
Vengeance at least is human.
No, by the gods, those severed right hands, and the brave king of Gauls basely strangled in a vault beneath the Capitol, were a wise severity, a necessary protection to the commonwealth, a duty of statesmanship-- follies and fictions ten times bloodier than honest vengeance!
What a fool was I then!
To think that men's lives should be at the mercy of such fools!
Lucius Septimius, pardon me: why should the slayer of the king of the Gauls rebuke the slayer of Pompey?
You are free to go.
All here in this palace.
Free?
Achillas army, renegades and all?
Free, Rufio.
Lucius Septimius,  You are free to go with the rest.
Or stay if you will:
I will find a place for you in my service.
The odds are against you, Caesar.
I go.
Farewell.
Come, Pothinus, Achillas, whilst there is yet time.
Do you suppose he would let us go if he had our heads in his hands?
Caesar: this is not good sense.
Your duty to Rome demands that her enemies should be prevented from doing further mischief.
It is no use talking to him, Britannus: you may save your breath to cool your porridge.
But mark this, Caesar.
Clemency is very well for you; but what is it for your soldiers, who have to fight tomorrow the men you spared yesterday?
You may give what orders you please; but I, for one, will take no prisoners.
I will kill my enemies in the field; then I shall never have to fight them again.
And now, with your leave, I will see these gentry off the premises.
What!
Have they left the boy alone!
Oh shame, shame!
Come, your majesty!
Is he...
Is he turning me out of my palace?
You are welcome to stay if you wish.
Go, my boy. I will not harm you; but you will be safer away, among your friends.
Here you are in the lion's mouth.
It is not the lion I fear, but the jackal.
Brave boy!
Little silly. You think that very clever.
Britannus: Attend the King.
Give him in charge to that Pothinus fellow.
And this piece of goods?
What is to be done with HER?
However, I suppose I may leave that to you.
Did you mean me to go with the rest?
You are free to do just as you please, Cleopatra.
Then you do not care whether I stay or not?
Of course I had rather you stayed.
Much, MUCH rather?
Much, much rather.
Then I consent to stay, because I am asked.
But I do not want to, mind.
That is quite understood.
Totateeta.
Her name is not Totateeta: it is Ftatateeta.
Ftatafeeta will forgive the erring tongue of a Roman.
Tota: the Queen will hold her state here in Alexandria.
Engage women to attend upon her; and do all that is needful.
Am I then the mistress of the Queen's household?
No:
I am the mistress of the Queen's household.
Go and do as you are told, or I will have you thrown into the Nile this very afternoon, to poison the poor crocodiles.
Oh no, no, no.
Oh yes, yes, yes.
You are very sentimental, Caesar; but you are clever; and if you do as as I tell you, you will soon learn how to govern.
Pothinus!
Achillas!
Lucius Septimius!
Egypt for the Egyptians!
Your barley water, Caesar.
Ftatateeta!
Ftatateeta!
Get up, child, you must be bathed this morning.
No!
I had my month's bath a day before yesterday.
In future you must have a bath every day.
No, no, I should die.
You must!
Your life is changed.
You are still my child, but for all others you are grown woman and a queen.
Yes, I am a queen.
Ftata, what will Caesar do with me?
Ask rather what you will do with him.
My child, you have charmed him.
You are safe, you are powerful.
I will guide you until you learn how to guide yourself.
Fear nothing.
Who can fear Caesar?
He is not great and terrible, he is a near elderly gentleman rather sad looking and wrinkled but very kind.
He is a magician, and magicians can change their shapes, as they please.
Everything about him is magical.
He would not sleep in a golden chamber, but made his soldiers bring a bare stretcher from the camp, and put it in his study.
Even then he did not sleep in it and sat up working like a slave all night.
Everyone obeys him as if he were a god
I think he is a god in disguise, for he's changed your nature, has he not?
Yes he has. That is true.
Ftatateeta, before he came I was afraid of you more than anybody else on earth.
And now I am not afraid of you at all.
Tell me what I must do to begin with now that I am really a queen.
You must begin by having a bath, every day.
Come child, get it over, you will soon get used to it and love.
Never. It is too dreadful.
If I must to be washed again so soon,
Ftatateeta, let it be a scented bath.
Have you scented it?
No, Caesar hates perfumes.
And if you redden your lips he will not kiss you.
Come on.
He must indeed be a god.
For only a god could be so unlike a man.
No!
Cleopatra, I really think I must eat you, after all.
You must not talk to me now as if I were a child.
You have been growing up since the Sphinx introduced us that night; and you think you know more than I do already.
No: that would be very silly of me: of course I know that. But, are you angry with me?
No.
Then why are you so thoughtful?
I have work to do.
Work! What a nonsense!
You must remember that you are a King now:
I have made you one.
Kings don't work.
Oh! Who told you that, little kitten? Eh?
My father was King of Egypt; and he never worked.
But he lost his throne.
And how did he get it back again?
I will tell you.
A beautiful young man, with strong round arms, came over the desert with many horsemen, and gave my father back his throne.
I was only twelve then.
Oh, I wish he would come again, now that I am a Queen.
I would make him my husband.
It might be managed, perhaps; for it was I who sent that beautiful young man to help your father.
You know him! Has he come with you?
Oh, I wish he had,
I wish he had.
He is many, MANY years younger than you, is he not?
Yes, he is somewhat younger.
Would he be my husband, do you think, if I asked him?
Very likely.
But I should not like to ask him.
Could you...
Could you not persuade him to ask me-- without knowing that I wanted him to?
My poor child!
Why do you say that as if you were sorry for me?
Does he love anyone else?
I am afraid so.
Then I shall not be his first love.
Not quite the first.
He is greatly admired by women.
I wish I could be the first.
But if he loves me, I will make him kill all the rest.
Tell me: is he still beautiful?
Do his strong round arms shine in the sun like marble?
He is in excellent condition-- considering how much he eats and drinks.
Oh, you must not say common, earthly things about him; for I love him.
He is a god.
What is his name?
His name is Mark Antony.
Mark Antony,
Mark Antony,
Mark Antony!
What a beautiful name!
Oh, how I love you for sending him to help my father!
You must run away for a little and send my secretary to me.
No, no, no: I want to stay and hear you talk about Mark Antony.
But if I do not get to work,
Pothinus and the rest of them will cut us off from the harbor; and then the road to Rome will be blocked.
No matter: I don't want you to go back to Rome.
But you want Mark Antony to come from it.
Oh yes, yes, yes: I forgot.
Go quickly, Caesar; and keep the way over the sea open for my Mark Antony.
What now?
This, Caesar; and two of my comrades killed in the market place.
Ay. Why?
There is an army come to Alexandria, calling itself the Roman army.
The Roman army of occupation. Ay?
Commanded by one Achillas.
Well?
The citizens rose against us when the army entered the gates. They set upon us.
I cut my way out.
Good. I am glad to see you alive. Rufio, we are besieged.
What! Already?
Caesar, Caesar!
Yes, yes: I know.
Comrade: give the word to turn out on the beach and stand by the boats.
Get your wound attended to.
Britannus, go with him.
Rufio: we have some ships in the west harbor.
Burn them.
Burn them!!
Take every boat we have in the east harbor, and seize the
Pharos--that island with the lighthouse.
Leave half our men behind to hold the beach and the quay outside this palace: that is the way home to Rome.
For the rest, Egypt for the Egyptians!
Well, you know best, I suppose. Is that all?
That is all. Are those ships burnt yet?
Be easy: I shall waste no more time.
Caesar: Pothinus demands speech with you.
Where is he?
Waits in the council chamber.
It's my opinion he needs a lesson.
His manner is most insolent.
Well, Pothinus?
I have brought you our ultimatum, Caesar.
Ultimatum!
The door was open: you should have gone out through it before you declared war.
You are my prisoner now.
I YOUR prisoner!
Do you know that
King Ptolemy, with an army outnumbering your little troop a hundred to one, is in possession of Alexandria?
Well, my friend, get out if you can.
And tell your friends not to kill any more Romans in the market place.
Otherwise my soldiers, who do not share my celebrated clemency, will probably kill you.
Pass the word to the guard;
Pothinus is now prisoner.
Britannus, fetch my armor.
Caesar! Caesar!
What?
The ships ablaze already!
Impossible!
It's not my doing.
The Egyptians have saved me the trouble.
They have captured the west harbor.
And the east harbor? The lighthouse, Rufio?
Can I embark a legion in five minutes?
The first cohort is already on the quay.
If you want faster work, come and do it yourself?
Patience, Rufio, patience.
Patience!
Who is impatient here, you or I?
Forgive me, Rufio; and hurry them as much as you can.
Help, help, help, help!
Woe, alas!
Woe, alas.
Help, help!
Who is slain?
Slain!
Oh, worse than the death of ten thousand men!
Loss irreparable to mankind!
What has happened, man?
The fire has spread from your ships.
The library of Alexandria is in flames.
Is that all?
Rufio, is Britannus asleep?
I sent him for my armor an hour ago.
Britannus, Britannikus!
Caesar: will you go down to posterity as a barbarous soldier too ignorant to know the value of books?
Theodotus: I am an author myself;
Good.
What is burning there is the memory of mankind.
A shameful memory. Let it burn.
Will you destroy the past?
Ay, and build the future with its ruins.
Harken to me, Theodotus, teacher of kings:
I cannot spare you a man or a bucket of water just now; but you shall pass freely out of the palace.
Now, away with you to Achillas; and borrow his legions to put out the fire.
Caesar, posterity will bless you.
Will you stay to talk whilst the memory of mankind is burning?
Sentry, pass Theodotus out.
Away with you. Away with you.
I must save the library.
What's this!
Have you let them go? Is this more clemency?
I have let him go to save the library.
We must respect literature, Rufio.
Folly on folly's head!
Besides, my friend: every Egyptian we imprison means imprisoning two good
Roman soldiers to guard him. Eh?
Agh! I might have known there was some fox's trick behind your fine talking.
All ready, there?
All ready.
We wait for Caesar.
Tell them Caesar is coming-- the rogues!
Caesar's guard there. Push off, all except the longboat. Stand by it to embark
I am going to dress you, Caesar. Sit down.
Caesar, this is not proper.
These Roman helmets are so becoming!
What are you laughing at?
You're bald!
Cleopatra!
So that is why you wear the wreath-- to hide it.
Peace, Egyptian: they are the bays of the conqueror.
Peace, thou: islander!
You should rub your head with strong spirits of sugar, Caesar.
That will make it grow.
Cleopatra: do you like to be reminded that you are very young?
No.
No do I like to be reminded that I am--middle aged.
Now.
Oh! how nice!
You look only about 50 in it!
You must not speak in this manner to Caesar.
Is it true that when Caesar caught you on that island, you were painted all over blue?
Blue is the color worn by all Britons of good standing.
In war we stain our bodies blue; so that though our enemies may strip us of our clothes and our lives, they cannot strip us of our respectability.
Let me hang this on.
Now you look splendid.
Now Caesar: have you done talking?
The longboat awaits you.
The others race to the lighthouse.
Is this well set today, Britannicus?
At Pharsalia it was as blunt as a barrel-hoop.
It will split one of the Egyptian's hairs to-day, Caesar.
I have set it myself.
Oh, you are not really going into battle to be killed?
No, Cleopatra. No man goes to battle to be killed.
But they DO get killed.
My sister's husband was killed in battle.
You must not go.
Let HIM go.
Oh please, PLEASE don't go.
What will happen to ME if you never come back?
Are you afraid?
No.
Come to the balcony; and you shall see us take the Pharos.
You must learn to look on battles.
Then take me with you.
Take me to come with you to the Pharos.
No, no, my child, you must stay here till I return.
That is well.
Now, Rufio. March.
Oh, you will not be able to go!
Why? What now?
They are drying up the harbor with buckets-- a multitude of soldiers--over there-- they are dipping up the water.
This is your accursed clemency, Caesar.
Theodotus has brought them.
I meant him to, Rufio.
They have come to put out the fire.
The library will keep them busy whilst we seize the lighthouse. Eh?
More foxing!
Caesar!
Cleopatra, if all goes well
I shall be back this evening.
All aboard.
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Hail, Caesar!
Give way there.
Goodbye, my Caesar. Come back safe.
Goodbye!
Who goes there, eh?
Stand.
Who are you?
Centurion, I am Apollodorus the Sicilian.
My calling is to choose beautiful things for beautiful queens.
Carpets for the Queen's apartments in the palace.
The Queen?
Yes, yes: pass him in.
Pass all these bazaar people in to the Queen, with their goods.
But mind you pass no one out that you have not passed in-- not even the Queen herself.
I have brought my caravan past three sentinels, all so busy staring at the lighthouse that not one of them challenged me.
Is this your Roman discipline?
We are not here to watch the land but the sea.
Who is this piece of Egyptian crockery?
Apollodorus: rebuke this Roman dog; and bid him bridle his tongue in the presence of the mistress of the Queen's household.
This is a great lady, who stands high with Caesar.
Ftatateeta!
What are you dreaming of?
Ftatateeta!
No, no, you must not come out.
There are men here.
Oh that ever I was born!
Ftatateeta: I have thought of something.
I want a boat--at once.
A boat! No, no: you cannot.
Apollodorus: speak to the Queen.
Beautiful Queen: I am Apollodorus the
Sicilian, your servant, from the bazaar.
I have no time for carpets to-day.
Get me a boat.
You cannot go on the water except in the royal barge.
Royalty, Ftatateeta, lies not in the barge but in the Queen.
The touch of your majesty's foot on the meanest boat in the harbor will make it royal.
Apollodorus: you are my perfect knight; and I will always buy my carpets through you.
Can you row?
My oars shall be your majesty's wings.
Ho there, boatman!
Whither shall I row my Queen?
To the lighthouse. Come.
Stand. You cannot pass.
How dare you?
Do you know that I am the Queen?
I have my orders.
You cannot pass.
Ftatateeta: strangle him.
Keep off there.
Pass on to the palace and take the Queen in with you.
And how if I do neither?
Then I will drive this pilum through you.
At your service, my friend.
Help him, help him!
I shall not need help, my lady.
What should it be: sword against pilum, or sword against sword?
Roman against Sicilian, curse you.
Take that!
Help! Help!
Thrust your knife into the dog's throat, Apollodorus.
Curse on you!
Let me go. Ho there, guard, help, help.
Stab the little Roman reptile.
Spit him on your sword.
What is all this?
Make your report, soldier.
This old woman is dangerous: she is as strong as three men.
Centurion, he would have slain the queen.
I would, sooner than let her pass.
Cleopatra: I am loath to offend you; but without Caesar's express order we dare not let you pass beyond the Roman lines.
You must withdraw into the palace and examine your carpets there.
I will not:
I am the Queen.
Caesar does not speak to me as you do.
Have Caesar's centurions changed manners with his scullions?
I do my duty. That is enough for me.
Majesty: when a stupid man is doing something he is ashamed of, he always declares that it is his duty.
As for you, Apollodorus, you may thank the gods that you are not nailed to the palace door with a pilum for your meddling.
Is the woman your wife?
Jupiter, no!
Not that the lady is not a striking figure in her own way.
But she is NOT my wife.
Roman: I am Ftatateeta, the mistress of the Queen's household.
Keep your hands off our men, mistress; or I will have you pitched into the harbor, though you were as strong as ten men.
We shall see whom Isis loves best: her servant Ftatateeta or a dog of a Roman.
Two more men to this post here; and see that no one leaves the palace but this man and his merchandize.
If he draws his sword again -- kill him.
Get about your business.
Yes: you ought to know better.
Off with you.
Do not tantalize a poor man.
Pearl of Queens: the Centurion is at hand; and the Roman soldier is incorruptible when his officer is looking.
I shall carry your word to Caesar.
Are these carpets very heavy?
It matters not how heavy.
There are plenty of porters.
How do they put them into the boats?
Do they - throw them down?
Not into small boats, majesty.
It would sink them.
Not into that man's boat, for instance?
No, no. Too small.
But you can take a carpet to Caesar in it if I send one?
Assuredly.
And you will have it carried gently down the steps and take great care of it?
Great, GREAT care?
More than of my own body.
Good. Come, Ftatateeta.
No, Apollodorus, you must not come.
I will choose my carpet myself.
You must wait here.
Follow this lady and obey her.
This way.
And take your shoes off before you put your feet on those stairs.
Listen: were you set here to watch me, or to watch the Egyptians?
We know our duty.
Then why don't you do it? Look!
The Egyptians are moving.
They are going to recapture the Pharos.
They will attack by land and sea: along the great mole;
Stir yourselves: the hunt is up.
Centurion, reinforce the platoons on the mole.
Yes, sir.
Rufio: this has been a mad expedition.
We shall be beaten.
The Egyptians cannot be such fools as not to storm the barricade and swoop down on us here before it is finished.
It is the first time
I have ever run an avoidable risk.
I should not have come to Egypt.
An hour ago you were all for victory.
Yes: I was a fool, rash, Rufio, boyish.
Boyish! Not a bit of it. Here.
What are these for?
Eat.
That's what's the matter with you.
When a man comes to your age, he runs down before the midday meal.
Go on. Eat and drink; then take another look at our chances.
My age! Yes, I am an old man, worn out now; quite true, Rufio.
Achillas is still in his prime:
Ptolemy is a boy.
Well, every dog has his day; and I have had mine: I cannot complain.
These dates are not bad, Rufio.
That's my old Caesar.
That's a great war; now we've got rid of the women.
You again?
Keep your distance.
Come within a yard of me, you old crocodile; and I will give you this in your jaw.
Peace, Roman fellow: you are now single-handed.
Apollodorus: this carpet is
Cleopatra's present to Caesar.
It has rolled up in it ten precious goblets of the thinnest Iberian crystal, and a hundred eggs of the sacred blue pigeon.
On your honor, let not one of them be broken.
On my head be it.
Load carefully it into the boat.
Those eggs, of which the lady speaks must weigh more than a pound a piece.
This boat is much too small for such a load.
Yes, yes, too small!
Yes, yes.
Oh thou injurious porter!
Oh thou unnatural son of a she-camel!
My boat, sir, can carry five men.
Shall it not carry your lordship and a bale of pigeons' eggs?
Thou mangey dromedary, the gods shall punish thee for this envious wickedness.
I cannot quit this bale now to beat thee; but another day I will lie in wait for thee.
Peace there, all of you.
In the name of the gods, Apollodorus, run no risks with that bale.
Fear not, thou venerable grotesque:
I guess its great worth.
Into the boat, gently, my sons, my children--gently, ye dogs! so--'tis well.
Do not step on it, do not step on it.
Be not excited, mistress: all is well.
Oh thou brute beast!
Oh, thou hast given my heart a turn!
Here, ye hungry ones.
Robber of the poor. It's not enough!
O bounteous prince!
O lord of the bazaar!
O favored of the gods!
O father to all the porters of the market!
Farewell, Ftatateeta. I shall be at the lighthouse before the Egyptians.
The gods speed thee.
Farewell, valiant pilum pitcher.
My heart, my heart, 
Spread out thy wings, 
Spread out thy wings,
Shake off thy heavy
Load of love ...
Caesar!
Caesar!
Our brave mariners have captured a treasure.
Our enemies are delivered into our hands.
In that bag?
Wait till you hear, Caesar.
This bag contains all the letters which have passed between our enemies.
Well?
Well, we shall now know who your foes are.
The name of every man who has plotted against you since you crossed the Rubicon may be in these papers, for all we know.
Put them in the fire.
Put them--
In the fire.
Would you have me waste the next three years of my life condemning men who will be my friends when I have proved that my friendship is worth more than my enemies.
But your honor--the honor of Rome--
I do not make human sacrifices to my honor, as your Druids do.
Since you will not burn these, at least I can drown them.
Caesar: this is mere eccentricity.
Are traitors to be allowed to go free for the sake of a paradox?
Caesar: when the islander has finished preaching, call me again.
O Caesar, my great master, if I could but persuade you to regard life seriously, as men do in my country!
Do they truly do so, Britannus?
Have you not been there?
Have you not seen them?
What Briton speaks as you do in your moments of levity?
What Briton neglects to attend the services at the sacred grove?
What Briton wears clothes of many colors as you do, instead of plain blue, as all solid, well esteemed men should?
These are moral questions with us.
Well, well, my friend: some day I shall settle down and have a blue toga, perhaps.
Meanwhile, I must get on as best I can in my flippant Roman way.
What now?
Hail!
What is this? Who are you?
How did you come here?
Calm yourself, my friend:
I am not going to eat you.
Hail, great Caesar!
I am Apollodorus the Sicilian, an artist.
An artist! A vagabond?
Peace, man. Apollodorus is a famous patrician amateur.
I crave the gentleman's pardon.
I understood him to say that he was a professional.
You are welcome, Apollodorus.
What is your business?
First, to deliver to you a present from the Queen of Queens.
Who is that?
Cleopatra of Egypt.
Apollodorus: this is no time for playing with presents.
Pray you, go back to the Queen, and tell her that if all goes well we shall return to the palace this evening.
Caesar: I cannot return.
As I approached the lighthouse, some fool threw a great leathern bag into the sea.
It broke the nose of my boat; and I had hardly time to get myself and my charge to the shore before the poor little cockleshell sank.
I am sorry, Apollodorus.
The fool shall be rebuked.
Well, well: what have you brought me?
The Queen will be hurt if I do not look at it.
Caesar, have we time to waste on this trumpery?
The Queen is only a child.
Just so: that is why we must not disappoint her.
Caesar: it is a Persian carpet-- a beauty!
And in it are--so I am told-- pigeons' eggs and crystal goblets and fragile precious things.
I dare not for my head have it carried up that narrow ladder from the causeway.
Swing it up by the crane, then.
The crane!
Caesar: I have sworn to tender this bale of carpet as I tender my own life.
Then let them swing you up at the same time; and if the chain breaks, you and the pigeons' eggs will perish together.
Is Caesar serious?
His manner is frivolous because he is an Italian; but he means what he says.
Serious or not, he spoke well.
Give me a squad of soldiers to work the crane.
No-no it's worked by elderly Tyrian and his son.
Well conducted youth of ... 14.
What!
An old man and boy work that?
Twenty men, you mean?
No, no, two only, I assure you.
They have counterweights, and a machine with boiling water in it which I do not understand: it is not of British design.
Leave the crane to me.
Go and await the descent of the chain.
Good.
You will see me presently there rising like the sun with my treasure.
Are you really going to wait here for this foolery, Caesar?
Why not?
The Egyptians will let you know why not if they have the sense to make a rush before our barricade is finished.
And here we are waiting like children to see a carpet full of pigeons' eggs.
Fear not, my son Rufio.
When the first Egyptian takes his first step along the mole, the alarm will sound; and we two will reach the barricade before the Egyptians-- we two, Rufio:
I, the old man, and you, his biggest boy.
And the old man will be there first.
So peace; and give me some more dates.
Haul away.
Easy there:
Further round!
So. Haul up.
Gently-- slowly, slowly--mind the eggs.
Slowly, slowly.
Haul away.
Stand off, my friends: let Caesar see.
Nothing but a heap of shawls.
Where are the pigeons' eggs?
Approach, Caesar; and search for them among the shawls.
Ha, treachery! Keep back, Caesar: I saw the shawl move: there is something alive there.
It is a serpent.
Dares Caesar thrust his hand into the sack where the serpent moves?
Treacherous dog--
Peace. Put up your swords.
Apollodorus: your serpent seems to breathe very regularly.
This is a pretty little snake.
Let us have the rest of you.
Oh, I'm smothered.
Oh, Caesar; a man stood on me in the boat; and a great sack of something fell upon me out of the sky; and then the boat sank, and then I was swung up into the air and bumped down.
Well, never mind: here you are safe and sound at last.
Ay; and now that she is here, what are we to do with her?
Caesar, it is not proper.
She cannot stay here, without the companionship of some matron.
Shocking!
Aren't you glad to see me?
Yes, I am very glad. But Rufio is very angry; and Britannus is shocked.
You can have their heads cut off, can't you?
They would not be so useful with their heads cut off  as they are now, my sea bird.
We shall have to go away presently and cut some of your Egyptians' heads.
How will you like being left here with the chance of being captured by that little brother of yours if we are beaten?
But you mustn't leave me alone. Caesar you will not leave me alone, will you?
What!
Not when the trumpet sounds and all our lives depend on Caesar's being at the barricade before the Egyptians reach it? Eh?
Let them lose their lives: they are only soldiers.
Cleopatra: when that trumpet sounds, we must take every man his life in his hand, and throw it in the face of Death.
And of my soldiers who have trusted me there is not one whose hand I shall not hold more sacred than your head.
Apollodorus: you must take her back to the palace.
Am I a dolphin, Caesar, to cross the seas with young ladies on my back?
My boat is sunk: all yours are either at the barricade or have returned to the city.
It does not matter.
I will not go back.
Nobody cares for me.
Cleopatra--
You want me to be killed.
My poor child: your life matters little here to anyone but yourself.
Come, Rufio.
Caesar, do not leave me.
Caesar: we are cut off.
The Egyptians have landed from the west harbor between us and the barricade!!!
Rufio: my men at the barricade are lost.
I have murdered them.
Ay: that comes of fooling with this girl here.
Caesar!
Caesar, the Egyptians.
I know. We must defend ourselves here.
I have thrown the ladder into the sea.
They cannot get in without it.
Ay; and we cannot get out.
Have you thought of that?
Not get out! Why not?
You have ships in the east harbor.
The  galleys are standing in towards us already.
And by what road are we to walk to the galleys, pray?
By the road that leads everywhere-- the diamond path of the sun and moon.
How far off is the nearest galley?
Fifty fathom.
No, no: Nearly quarter of a mile, Apollodorus.
Good. Defend yourselves here until
I send you a boat from that galley.
Have you wings, perhaps?
Water wings, soldier.
Behold!
Bravo, Apollodorus, bravo!
By Jupiter, I will do that too.
Britannus.
You are mad. You shall not.
Why not? Can I not swim as well as he?
Can an old fool dive and swim like a young one?
Old!!! Rufio: you forget yourself.
I will race you to the galley for a week's pay, father Rufio.
But me! Me!! Me!!! What is to become of me?
I will carry you on my back to the galley like a dolphin.
Rufio: when you see me rise to the surface, throw her in:
No, no. I shall be drowned.
And then in with you after her, both of you.
Caesar: I am a man and a Briton, not a fish.
I must have a boat. I cannot swim.
Neither can I.
Stay here, then, Britannus, until I recapture the lighthouse.
I will not forget you. Now, Rufio.
You have made up your mind to this folly?
The Egyptians have made it up for me.
And mind where you jump:
I do not want to get you in the small of my back as I come up.
One last word, Caesar.
Do not let yourself be seen in the fashionable part of Alexandria until you have changed your clothes.
Ho, Apollodorus: The white upon the blue above--
Is purple on the green below--
Oh, let me see.
He will be drowned.
Ah-ah-ah-ah!
He has got her.
Hold the fort, Briton.
Caesar will not forget you.
Another royal banquet in Caesar's honour.
These Romans are magicians.
For six months a mere handful of them held the palace against all Egypt's army forces.
And look at their escape from the Pharos.
Who but a magician could swim like a dolphin at Caesar's age carrying a queen on his back.
That might be the Queen's magic.
She rides on Caesar's back on land now as on the sea.
You laugh; take care, take care,
I will find out some day how to make myself served as Caesar is served.
Old hooknose!
Silence.
Do you know why I allow you all to chatter impertinently just as you please, instead of treating you as Ftatateeta would treat you if she were Queen?
Because you try to imitate Caesar in everything; and he lets everybody say what they please to him.
No; but because I asked him one day why he did so; and he said "Let your women talk; and you will learn something from them."
What have I to learn from them? I said.
"What they ARE," said he; and oh! you should have seen his eye as he said it.
You would have curled up, you shallow things.
At whom are you laughing-- at me or at Caesar?
At Caesar.
If you were not a fool, you would laugh at me; and if you were not a coward you would not be afraid to tell me so.
Heigho!
I wish Caesar were back in Rome.
It will be a bad day for you when he goes.
Oh, if I were not ashamed to let him see that I am as cruel at heart as my father,
I would make you repent that speech!
Why do you wish him away?
He makes you so terribly prosy and serious and learned and philosophical.
It is worse than being religious, at OUR ages.
Cease that endless cackling, will you.
Hold your tongues.
Well, well: we must try to live up to Caesar.
Pothinus craves the ear of the Queen.
I suppose he has bribed you to admit him to me.
Not, by my father's gods!
Have I not told you not to deny things.
All you sell audiences to the Queen as if I saw whom you please and not whom I please.
Go, take the bribe; and bring in Pothinus.
But...
Don't answer me.
Go.
I want to learn to play the harp with my own hands.
Caesar loves music.
Can you teach me?
Assuredly.
I and no one else can teach the Queen.
All the other teachers are quacks:
I have exposed them ... repeatedly.
Good: you shall teach me.
How long will it take?
Not very long: only four years.
Your Majesty must first become proficient in the philosophy of Pythagoras.
Has she become proficient in the philosophy of Pythagoras?
Oh, she is but a slave.
She learns as a dog learns.
Well, then, I will learn as a dog learns; for she plays better than you.
You shall give me a lesson every day for a fortnight.
After that, whenever I strike a false note you shall be flogged; and if I strike so many that there is not time to flog you, you shall be thrown into the Nile to feed the crocodiles.
Give the girl a gold piece; and send them away.
But true art cannot be thus forced.
What is this?
Answering the Queen, forsooth.
Out with you.
Well, Pothinus: what is the latest news from your rebel friends?
I am no friend of rebellion.
And a prisoner does not receive news.
You are no more a prisoner than I am--than Caesar is.
These six months we have been besieged in this palace by my subjects.
You are allowed to walk on the beach among the soldiers.
Can I go further myself, or can Caesar?
You are but a child, Cleopatra, and do not understand these matters.
I see you do not know the latest news, Pothinus.
What is that?
That Cleopatra is no longer a child.
Shall I tell you how to grow much older, and much,
MUCH wiser in one day?
I should prefer to grow wiser without growing older.
Well, go up to the top of the lighthouse; and get somebody to take you by the hair and throw you into the sea.
She is right, Pothinus: you will come to the shore with much conceit washed out of you.
Begone, all of you. I will speak with Pothinus alone.
What are YOU waiting for?
It is not meet that the Queen remain alone with--
Must I sacrifice you to your father's gods, Ftatateeta, to teach you that I am
Queen of Egypt, and not you?
You are like the rest of them.
You want to be what these Romans call a New Woman.
Now, Pothinus: why did you bribe Ftatateeta to bring you hither?
Cleopatra: what they tell me is true.
You are changed.
Do you speak with Caesar every day for six months: and YOU will be changed.
It is the common talk that you are infatuated with this old man.
Infatuated? What does that mean?
Made foolish, is it not?
Oh no: I wish I were.
You wish you were made foolish! How so?
When I was foolish, I did what I liked,
Now that Caesar has made me wise, it is no use my liking or disliking;
I do what must be done, and have no time to attend to myself.
That is not happiness; but it is greatness.
I think
If Caesar were gone,
I could govern the Egyptians;
Cleopatra: this may be the vanity of youth.
No, no: it is not that I am so clever, but that the others are so stupid.
Truly, that is the great secret.
Now tell me what you came to say?
I! Nothing.
Nothing!
At least--to beg for my liberty: that is all.
For that you would have knelt to Caesar.
No, Pothinus: you came with some plan that depended on Cleopatra being a little nursery kitten.
Now that Cleopatra is a Queen, the plan is upset.
Is Cleopatra then indeed a Queen, and no longer Caesar's prisoner and slave?
Pothinus: we are all Caesar's slaves-- all we in this land of Egypt-- whether we will or no.
And she who is wise enough to know this will reign when Caesar departs.
You harp on Caesar's departure.
What if I do?
Does he not love you?
Love me!
Pothinus: Caesar loves no one.
He makes friends with everyone as he does with dogs and children.
His kindness to me is a wonder: neither mother, father, nor nurse have ever taken so much care for me, or thrown open their thoughts to me so freely.
But how can you be sure that he does not love you as men love women?
Because I cannot make him jealous.
I have tried.
Hm! Perhaps I should have asked, then, do you love him?
Can one love a god?
Besides, I love another Roman: no god, but a man--one who can love and hate-- one whom I can hurt and who would hurt me.
Does Caesar know this?
Yes.
And he is not angry.
He promises to send him to Egypt to please me!
I do not understand this man?
YOU understand Caesar! How could you?
I do--by instinct.
Your Majesty caused me to be admitted to-day.
What message has the Queen for me?
This. You think that by making my brother king, you will rule in Egypt, because you are his guardian and he is a little silly.
The Queen is pleased to say so.
The Queen is pleased to say this also.
That Caesar will eat up you, and Achillas, and my brother, as a cat eats up mice; and that he will put on this land of Egypt as a shepherd puts on his garment.
And when he has done that, he will return to Rome, and leave Cleopatra here as his viceroy.
That he shall never do.
We have a thousand men to his ten; and we will drive him and his beggarly legions into the sea.
You rant like any common fellow.
Cleopatra--
Enough.
Ftatateeta!
Caesar has spoiled me for talking to weak things like you.
I know to whom I must go now.
Let me go forth from this hateful place.
What angers you?
The curse of all the gods of Egypt be upon her!
She has sold her country to the Roman, that she may buy it back from him with her kisses.
Fool: did she not tell you that she would have Caesar gone?
You listened?
I took care that some honest woman should be at hand whilst you were with her.
And mark this, mistress.
You thought, before Caesar came, that Egypt should presently be ruled by you and your crew in the name of Cleopatra.
I set myself against it.
Ay; that it might be ruled by you and
YOUR crew in the name of Ptolemy.
Better me, or even you, than a woman with a Roman heart; and that is what Cleopatra is now become.
Whilst I live, she shall never rule.
So guide yourself accordingly.
Wait here.
Here, your excellency.
The Roman commander will await Caesar here.
That was a climb.
How high have we come?
We are on the palace roof,
O Beloved of Victory!
Good! the Beloved of Victory has no more stairs to get up.
Caesar approaches.
Why, Rufio! A new baldrick!
A new golden pommel to your sword!
And you have had your hair cut!
But not your beard--?
Impossible!
Yes, perfumed, by Jupiter Olympus!
Well: is it to please myself?
No, Rufio, my son, but to please me-- to celebrate my birthday.
Your birthday! You always have a birthday when there is a pretty girl to be flattered or an ambassador to be conciliated.
Rufio ...
We had seven of them in ten months last year.
Alas Rufio! I shall never break myself of these petty deceits.
Have you noticed that I am before my time?
Aha! I thought that meant something.
What is it?
Pothinus wants to speak to you.
I advise you to see him: there is some plotting going on here among the women.
Who is Pothinus?
Oh, yes!
And has he not escaped?
No.
Why not?
Have I not told you always to let prisoners escape unless there are special orders to the contrary?
Are there not enough mouths to be fed without his?
Yes. and if you would have a little sense and let me cut his throat, you would save his rations.
Anyway, he WON'T escape.
He prefers to stay and spy on us.
And you want me to see him?
I don't want anything.
I daresay you will do what you like.
Don't put it on to me.
Well, well: let us have him in.
Ho there, guard!
Release your man and send him up.
Who is to dine with us-- besides Cleopatra?
Apollodorus the Sicilian.
That popinjay!
Come! the popinjay is an amusing dog-- tells a story; sings a song; and saves us the trouble of flattering the Queen.
Well, he can swim a bit and fence a bit: he might be worse, if he only knew how to hold his tongue.
The gods forbid he should ever learn!
Ah, Pothinus!
You are welcome.
And what is the news this afternoon?
Caesar: I come to warn you of a danger, and to make you an offer.
Never mind the danger. Make the offer.
Never mind the offer. What's the danger?
Caesar: you think that
Cleopatra is devoted to you.
My friend: I already know what I think.
Come to your offer.
I will deal plainly.
I know not by what magic you have been enabled to defend the palace and a few yards of beach against a city and an army.
But we know now that your gods are irresistible, and that you are a worker of miracles.
I no longer threaten you.
Very handsome of you, indeed.
So be it: you are the master.
Yes, yes, my friend.
But what then?
Spit it out, man. What have you to say?
I have to say that you have a traitress in your camp.
Cleopatra.
The Queen!
You should have spat it out sooner, you fool.
Now it is too late.
What is HE doing here?
Just going to tell me something about you.
You shall hear it.
Proceed, Pothinus.
I ... Caesar!
Well, out with it.
What I have to say is for your ear, not for the Queen's.
There are means of making you speak.
Take care.
Caesar does not employ those means.
My dear: when a man has anything to tell in this world, the difficulty is not to make him tell it, but to prevent him from telling it too often.
Let me celebrate my birthday by setting you free.
Farewell: we'll not meet again.
Caesar: this mercy is foolish.
Will you not give me a private audience?
Your life may depend on it.
Ho there, guard!
Pass the prisoner out. He is released.
Now off with you.
You have lost your chance.
I WILL speak.
You see.
Torture would not have wrung a word from him.
Caesar: you have taught Cleopatra the arts by which
Romans govern the world.
Alas, my friend! They cannot even govern themselves.
What then?
What then?
Are you so besotted with her beauty that you do not see that she is impatient to reign in Egypt alone, and that her heart is set on your departure?
Liar!
What!
Protestations! Contradictions!
No. I do not deign to contradict.
Let him talk.
From her own lips I have heard it.
You are to be her catspaw: you are to tear the crown from her brother's head and set it on her own, delivering us all into her hand-- delivering yourself also.
And then Caesar can return to Rome, or depart through the gate of death, which is nearer and surer.
Well, and is not this very natural?
Natural!
Then you do not resent treachery?
Resent!
O thou foolish Egyptian, what have I to do with resentment?
Do I resent the wind when it chills me, or the night when it makes me stumble in the darkness?
To tell me such a story as this is but to tell me that the sun will rise to-morrow.
But it is false--false. I swear it.
It is true, though you swore it a thousand times, and believed all you swore.
Come, Rufio: let us see Pothinus past the guard.
I have a word to say to him.
We must give the Queen a moment to recover herself.
Tell your friends, Pothinus, that they must not think
I am opposed to a reasonable settlement of the country's affairs--
Ftatateeta, Ftatateeta.
Peace, child: be comforted--
Can they hear us?
No, dear heart, no.
If he leaves the Palace alive, never see my face again.
He? Pothinus--
Strike his life out as I strike his name from your lips.
Dash him down from the wall.
Break him on the stones.
Kill, kill, KILL him.
The dog shall perish.
Fail in this, and you go out from before me forever.
So be it.
You shall not see my face until his eyes are darkened.
Soon--soon.
As the light dies he shall die.
So you have come back to me, Caesar.
I thought you were angry.
Welcome, Apollodorus.
Cleopatra grows more womanly beautiful from week to week.
Truth, Apollodorus?
Far, far short of the truth!
Friend Rufio threw a pearl into the sea:
Caesar fished up a diamond.
Caesar fished up a touch of rheumatism.
Come on.
Come: to dinner!
To dinner!
I have ordered SUCH a dinner for you, Caesar!
Ay? What are we to have?
Peacocks' brains.
Peacocks' brains, Apollodorus!
Not for me. I prefer nightingales' tongues.
Roast boar, Rufio!
Good!
What has become of my leathern cushion?
I have got new ones for you, Caesar.
These cushions, Caesar, are of Maltese gauze, stuffed with rose leaves.
Rose leaves!
Am I a caterpillar?
What a shame! My new cushions!
What shall we serve to whet
Caesar's appetite?
Any oysters?
Assuredly.
BRITISH oysters?
British oysters, of course.
Oysters, then.
Sea hedgehogs for me.
Have we nothing solid to begin with?
Fieldfares with asparagus--
Fattened fowls!
Have some fattened fowls, Rufio.
Ay, that will do.
Fieldfares for me.
Caesar will deign to choose his wine?
Sicilian, Tuscan, Macedonian, Chianti
All Greek.
Try the Sicilian, Caesar.
Bring me my barley water.
Ugh! Bring ME my Falernian.
It is waste of time giving you dinners, Caesar.
My scullions would not condescend to your diet.
Well, well: let us try the Falernian.
But when I return to Rome,
I will make laws against these extravagances.
I will even get the laws carried out.
Never mind.
To-day you are to be like other people: idle, luxurious, and kind.
Well, for once I will sacrifice my comfort there! Now are you satisfied?
And you no longer believe that
I long for your departure for Rome?
I no longer believe anything.
My brains are asleep.
Besides, who knows whether
I shall return to Rome?
How? Eh? What?
One year of Rome is like another, except that I grow older,
It is no better here in Egypt.
The old men, when they are tired of life, say
"We have seen everything except the source of the Nile."
And why not see that?
Cleopatra:will you come with me and track the flood to its cradle in the heart of the regions of mystery?
Shall I make you a new kingdom, and build you a holy city there in the great unknown?
Yes, Yes. You shall.
Ay: now he will conquer Africa with two legions before I finished the roast boar.
Come: no scoffing, this is a noble scheme:
Let us name the holy city, and consecrate it with Sicilian Wine-- and Cleopatra shall name it herself.
It shall be called Caesar's Gift to his Beloved.
No, no. Something vaster than that-- something universal, like the starry firmament.
Why not simply The Cradle of the Nile?
No: the Nile is my ancestor; and he is a god.
Oh! I have just thought of something.
The Nile shall name it himself.
Let us call upon him all together.
Send for him.
And away with all of you.
Go, I am a priestess, and have power to take your charge from you.
What hocus-pocus is this?
It is NOT hocus-pocus.
To do it properly, we should kill something to please him; but perhaps he will answer Caesar without that if we spill some wine to him.
Why not appeal to our hawkheaded friend here?
Sh! He will hear you and be angry.
The source of the Nile is not of his district, I expect.
Now let us call on the Nile all together.
You must say with me
"Send us thy voice, Father Nile."
Send us thy voice, Father Nile.
What was that?
Nothing.
They are beating some slave.
Nothing!
A man with a knife in him, I'll swear.
A murder!
S-sh! Silence.
Did you hear that?
Another cry?
No, a thud.
Something fell, I think.
Something with bones in it, eh?
Rufio.
Will you leave me, Caesar?
Apollodorus: are you going?
Faith, dearest Queen, my appetite is gone.
Apollodorus: go down to the courtyard, and find out what has happened.
Your soldiers have killed somebody, perhaps.
What does it matter?
This must be seen to.
Is she drunk?
Not with wine.
The Queen looks again on the face of her servant.
There is some mischief between those two.
Cleopatra: what has happened?
Nothing, dearest Caesar. Nothing.
I am innocent.
Dear Caesar: are you angry with me?
Why do you look at me so?
I have been here with you all the time.
How can I know what has happened?
That is true.
Of course it is true.
You know it is true, Rufio.
I shall know -- presently.
Caesar, remember, YOUR bodyguard is within call.
Why do you allow Rufio to speak to me so?
You should teach him his place.
Teach him to be my enemy, and to hide his thoughts from me as you are now hiding yours.
Why do you say that, Caesar?
Indeed, indeed, I am not hiding anything.
You are wrong to treat me like this.
I am only a child; and you turn into stone because you think someone has been killed.
I cannot bear it.
But there:
I know you hate tears: you shall not be troubled with them.
Only ...
I am so silly, I cannot help being hurt when you speak coldly.
Of course you are quite right: it is dreadful to think of anyone being killed or even hurt; and I hope nothing really serious has--
What has frightened you into this?
What have you done?
Murder!
Aha! That sounds like the answer.
I have not betrayed you, Caesar: I swear it.
I know that.
I have not trusted you.
The whole town has gone mad, I think.
They are for tearing the palace down and driving us into the sea straight away.
We laid hold of this renegade in clearing them out of the courtyard.
Release him.
What has offended the citizens, Lucius Septimius?
What did you expect, Caesar?
Pothinus was a favorite of theirs.
What has happened to Pothinus?
I set him free, here, not half an hour ago.
Did they not pass him out?
Ay, through the gallery arch sixty feet above ground, with three inches of steel in his ribs.
He is as dead as Pompey.
We are quits now, as to killing--you and I.
Assassinated!-- our prisoner, our guest! Rufio--
Whoever did it was a wise man and a friend of yours; but none of US had a hand in it.
So it is no use to frown at me.
He was slain by order of the Queen of Egypt.
I am not Julius Caesar the dreamer, who allows every slave to insult him.
Rufio has said I did well: now the others shall judge me too.
This Pothinus sought to make me conspire with him to betray Caesar.
I refused; and he cursed me and came privily to Caesar to accuse me of his own treachery. he insulted me--ME, the Queen! To my face.
Caesar would not revenge me: he spoke him fair and set him free.
Was I right to avenge myself?
Speak, Lucius.
I do not gainsay it.
But you will get little thanks  for it from Caesar.
Apollodorus, speak. Was I wrong?
I have only one word of blame, most beautiful.
You should have called upon me, your knight; and in fair duel
I should have slain the slanderer.
I will be judged by your very slave, Caesar.
Britannus: speak. Was I wrong?
Were treachery, falsehood, and disloyalty left unpunished, society must become like an arena full of wild beasts, tearing one another to pieces.
Caesar is in the wrong.
And so the verdict is against me, it seems.
Listen to me, Caesar.
If one man in all Alexandria can be found to say that I did wrong, I swear to have myself crucified on the door of the palace by my own slaves.
If one man in all the world can be found, now or forever, to know that you did wrong, that man will have either to conquer the world as I have, or be crucified by it.
Do you hear?
These knockers at your gate are also believers in vengeance and in stabbing.
You have slain their leader: it is right that they shall slay you.
And so, to the end of history, murder shall breed murder, always in the name of right and honor and peace, until the gods are tired of blood and create a race that can understand.
Let the Queen of Egypt now give her orders for vengeance, and take her measures for defense; for she has renounced Caesar.
You will not desert me, Caesar.
You will defend the palace.
You have taken the powers of life and death upon you.
I am only a dreamer.
But they will kill me.
And why not?
In pity--
Pity! What!
Has it come to this so suddenly, that nothing can save you now but pity?
Did it save Pothinus?
Caesar: enough of preaching.
The enemy is at the gate.
Ay; and what has held him baffled at the gate all these months?
Was it my folly, as you deem it, or your wisdom?
In this Egyptian Red Sea of blood, whose hand has held all your heads above the waves?
And yet, When Caesar says to such an one,
"Friend, go free," you, clinging for your little life to my sword, dare steal out and stab him in the back?
By the gods, I am tempted to open my hand and let you all sink into the flood.
Will you desert us because we are a parcel of fools?
I mean no harm by killing: do it as a dog kills a cat, by instinct.
We are all dogs at your heels; but we have served you faithfully.
Alas, Rufio, my son, as dogs we are like to perish now in the streets.
Caesar, what you say has an Olympian ring in it:
But I am still on the side of Cleopatra.
If we must die, she shall not want the devotion of a man's heart nor the strength of a man's arm.
But I don't want to die.
Oh, ignoble, ignoble!
Hearken to me, Caesar.
It may be ignoble; but I too mean to live as long as I can.
Well, my friend, you are likely to outlive Caesar.
Does Caesar despair?
He who has never hoped can never despair.
Caesar, in good or bad fortune, looks his fate in the face.
Look it in the face, now; and it will smile as it always has on Caesar.
Do you presume to encourage me?
I offer you my services.
I will change sides if you will have me.
What! At this point?
At this point.
Do you suppose Caesar is mad, to trust you?
I do not ask him to trust me until he is victorious.
I ask for my life, and for a command in Caesar's army.
And since Caesar is a fair dealer, I will pay in advance.
Pay! How?
With a piece of good news for you.
What news?
What news!
What news, did you say, my son Rufio?
The relief has arrived.
Mithridates of Pergamos is on the march.
Is it not so, Lucius Septimius?
He has taken Pelusium.
Lucius: you are henceforth my officer.
Rufio: the Egyptians must have sent every soldier from the city to prevent Mithridates crossing the Nile.
There is nothing in the streets now but mob--mob!
It is so.
Mithridates is marching by the great road to Memphis to cross above the Delta.
Achillas will fight him there.
Achillas shall fight Caesar there.
See, Rufio.
Here is the palace: here is the theatre.
You take twenty men and pretend to go by THAT street; and whilst they are stoning you, out go the cohorts by this and this.
My streets are right, are they, Lucius?
Ay, that is the fig market--
I saw them the day we arrived.
Away, Britannus: tell Petronius that within an hour half our forces must take ship for the western lake.
See to my horse and armor.
With the rest I shall march round the lake and up the Nile and catch Achillas in the desert.
Lucius; give the word to start.
Apollodorus, lend me your sword and your right arm for this campaign.
Ay, my heart and life to boot.
I accept both. Are you ready?
Ready for art, the art of war.
Come: this is something like business.
Is it not, my only son?
You understand about the streets, Rufio?
Ay, I think I do.
I will get through them, at all events.
Caesar.
Caesar.
Have you forgotten me?
Oh, I am busy now, my child, busy.
When I return your affairs shall be settled.
Farewell; and be good and patient.
That game is played and lost, Cleopatra.
The woman always gets the worst of it.
Go. Follow your master.
A word first.
Tell your executioner that if
Pothinus had been properly killed--
IN THE THROAT-- he would not have called out.
Your man bungled his work.
How do you know it was a man?
It was not you: you were with us when it happened.
Was it she? With her own hand?
Whoever it was, let my enemies beware of her.
Look to it, Rufio, you who dare make the Queen of Egypt a fool before Caesar.
I will look to it, Cleopatra.
Hail, Caesar!
Let us teach these Egyptians how to fight and how to run.
And then ... home, to Rome.
Hail, Caesar!
Ftatateeta.
Ftatateeta.
It is dark; and I am alone.
Come to me.
Ftatateeta.
The Queen looks again on the face of her servant.
For I am he of whose genius you are a symbol, part brute, part woman, and part god.
Hail Caesar...
Here he comes.
Hail Caesar!
I see my ship awaits me.
The hour for Caesar's farewell to Egypt has arrived.
And now, Rufio, what remains to be done before I go.
You have not yet appointed a Roman governor for this province.
What say you to Mithridates of Pergamos.
Why, that you will want him elsewhere.
Indeed!
Well, what say you to yourself?
I!
I a governor!
What are you dreaming of?
Do you not know that I am only the son of a freedman?
Has not Caesar called you his son?
Peace awhile there; and hear me.
Hear Caesar.
Hear the service, quality, rank and name of the Roman governor.
By service, Caesar's shield; by quality, Caesar's friend; by rank, a Roman soldier.
Hail Caesar!
By name, Rufio.
Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar!
Ay: I am Caesar's shield; but of what use will I be when I am no longer on Caesar's arm?
Where is that British Islander of mine?
Here, Caesar.
Who bade you, pray, thrust yourself into the battle of the Delta, uttering the barbarous cries of your native land,
Caesar: I ask you to excuse the language that escaped me in the heat of the moment.
And how did you, who cannot swim, cross the canal with us when we stormed the camp?
Caesar: I clung to the tail of your horse.
These are not the deeds of a slave,
Britannus, but of a free man.
Caesar: I was born free.
But they call you Caesar's slave.
Only as Caesar's slave have I found real freedom.
Well said.
Ungrateful that I am,
I was about to set you free; but now I will not part from you for a million talents.
This Roman knows how to make men serve him.
Apollodorus:
I leave the art of Egypt in your charge.
Remember:
Rome loves art and will encourage it.
I understand, Caesar.
Egypt must pay a tribute to Rome in art.
And now, what else have I to do before I embark?
There is something I cannot remember:
I wonder what it can be?
Well: it must remain undone: we must not waste this favorable wind.
Caesar: I am loath to let you go back to Rome without your shield.
There are too many daggers there.
It matters not:
I have always disliked the idea of dying:
I'd rather be killed.
Farewell Rufio.
Farewell.
Farewell, Apollodorus.
The Queen!
Ah, I KNEW there was something.
How could you let me forget her, Rufio?
Has Cleopatra no part in this leave taking?
Had I gone without seeing you,
I should never have forgiven myself.
Is this mourning for me?
NO.
Ah, that was thoughtless of me!
It is for your brother.
No.
For whom, then?
Ask the Roman governor whom you have left us.
Rufio?
Yes: Rufio.
He who is to rule here in Caesar's name, in Caesar's way, according to
Caesar's boasted laws of life.
He is to rule as he can, Cleopatra.
He has taken the work upon him, and will do it in his own way.
Not in your way, then? Without punishment.
Without revenge. Without judgment.
Ay: that is the right way, the great way, the only possible way in the end.
Believe it, Rufio, if you can.
I believe it, Caesar.
But look you,
Cleopatra had a tigress that killed men at her bidding.
I thought she might bid it kill you some day.
So, without malice, only cut its throat.
And that is why Cleopatra comes to you in mourning.
He has shed the blood of my servant Ftatateeta.
On your head be it Caesar, as upon his , if you hold him free of it.
On my head be it, then; for it was well done, Rufio.
Come: do not be angry with me.
I am sorry for that poor Totateeta.
Aha! You are laughing.
Does that mean reconciliation?
No, no, NO!!
Only it is so ridiculous to hear you call her Totateeta.
What! As much a child as ever, Cleopatra!
Have I not made a woman of you after all?
Oh, it is you, who are a great baby: you make me seem silly because you will not behave seriously.
But you have treated me badly; and I do not forgive you.
Bid me farewell.
I will not.
I will send you a beautiful present from Rome.
Beauty from Rome to Egypt indeed!
What can Rome give ME that Egypt cannot give me?
That is true, Caesar.
If the present is to be really beautiful,
I shall have to buy it for you in Alexandria.
You are forgetting the treasures for which Rome is most famous, my friend.
You cannot buy THEM in Alexandria.
What are they, Caesar?
Her sons.
Come, Cleopatra: forgive me and bid me farewell; and I will send you a man, not old and ripe for the knife; not hiding a bald head under his conqueror's laurels; not stooped with the weight of the world on his shoulders; but brisk and fresh, strong and young, hoping in the morning, fighting in the day, and reveling in the evening.
Will you take such an one in exchange for Caesar?
His name, his name?
Shall it be Mark Antony?
You are a bad hand at a bargain, mistress, if you will swap Caesar for Antony.
So now you are satisfied.
You will not forget.
I will not forget.
Farewell:
I do not think we shall meet again.
Hail and farewell!
Hail, Caesar; and farewell!
Hail, Caesar; and farewell!
Oh, no tears, dearest Queen: they stab your servant to the heart.
He will return some day.
I hope not.
But I can't help crying, just the same.

BATTLE OF THE RAILS
In June 1940 the Germans cut France in two, separating friends and family and blocking equipment and supplies behind the demarcation line, dividing the country into an occupied zone and a so-called "free" zone.
Linking the two zones, but under strict enemy control, were the railways.
France had to maintain its inner unity and relations with the outside world.
The barrier erected by the enemy had to be crossed by both the past and men.
The railways took on this task, its first form of resistance.
Growing bolder under the regime of terror, over four years they developed a fearsome weapon.
The day of the landings, they contributed considerably to disorganising transportation and to defeating the Germans in the battle for liberation.
Jews! It is strictly forbidden to cross the demarcation line into the occupied zone.
The train has arrived at Chalon-sur-Saône.
It will stop for 20 minutes.
Would passengers please produce their identity papers and passes, ready to be checked by the occupation authorities.
Please do not block the corridors.
Papers, please.
Thank you, madam.
- Checking!
- Stay there!
Dog for Lyon
Fill with water, now!
It's done!
Faster!
It's done.
I told you, it's done!
You're already late, you can do that further along!
All right, go.
You will now witness a very precise mechanism...
Command Post
From this command past, trains are directed and followed.
During the occupation these were often military transports: TCOs.
This is how it would work.
This gentleman requests a TCO of 50 wagons...
Hello? We need a 50-wagon train.
It's for a TCO.
The railwaymen take the greatest care over the TCO, cutting no corners and creating considerable delays.
Always with the greatest discretion.
- A bad wagon.
- No, no!
- Yes.
- No!
It should be scrapped,
I'm telling you.
- How long?
- An hour.
- Too much long!
- Too bad.
For a TCO?
I've only got one available.
You'll have to wait an hour for it.
Everything is in order on the traffic board too.
The command past is in direct contact with all the region's stations.
This chart shows a projection of all railway traffic.
That's the theory.
The reality is this other chart, on which the operator marks down the trains' progress according to their real positions.
The S1288 has just left.
When will it get to Sarrey?
On time... Plus forty minutes.
Corbin Station here. The S1288 is arriving, 58 minutes late.
To number their trains the Germans use indecipherable codes, which the railwaymen soon decipher.
Into the cogs of this precise mechanism the railwaymen insert pebbles, making it malfunction.
It doesn't run smoothly, it resists.
And who's behind this resistance?
Let's find out.
I've nothing more to explain.
- Cards tonight.
- Right.
- A new player.
- Good.
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hello.
- How's the old man?
- Fine.
Here's the new one
I told you about.
Well, I never!
Missus!
Careful now...
No messing about.
His name's Athos, what's yours?
Camargue.
Your tasks are to find sympathisers, gather intelligence and transmit it.
- I've got the lists.
- And the pamphlets?
You'll find them you know where.
- I'm in.
- OK?
Thanks.
I can get a few blokes together to distribute the pamphlets.
- Up to you.
- Trump!
Are there many of you?
A few more just coming.
Come on, get a move on!
There are a thousand ways to cause trouble for them.
I'm counting on you.
You can stop the wagons from leaving France...
You can cut the brakes...
You, Louis, can see to the fuel...
It's a magnetic bomb, it sticks all by itself.
Look.
There are two magnets, here and here.
Put it on something made of iron.
Watch out, Krauts!
Hide in the bays!
They're coming.
Air raid.
Everyone into the air-raid shelter.
That was close.
Sabotage of machines
Sabotage of supplies
After the friendly advice, the threats...
Plastered everywhere.
Death penalty for saboteurs
No passing!
- Move!
- What is it now?
Come on, Louis, they need an interpreter.
- Do you speak German?
- Yes.
You can interpret.
Comrades.
I must announce that acts of sabotage are being committed all the time.
This must stop.
We are fighting together on behalf of the same cause.
We are working together for the civilisation of the world.
We are reaching out to you.
But if you do not obey us, we shall have no choice but to crush you.
Translate!
He says..."Comrades, there's too much sabotage."
And he says...
"We're all working for the same cause."
Louder!
He says, "We're holding out our hand to you,
"but if you reply with your fist, we'll crush you."
Conclusion: ten German trains should have left that evening.
And six men, two groups of three, were arrested as hostages.
But words have no power here...
Get out, quick!
Come with me!
Get over here!
Wait.
- What do we do it with it?
- Hide it till later!
Hide it.
Here, deal with this.
Finish up here,
I've got other things to do.
Aim.
Fire!
3 wagons of concentrated milk
15 of flour
2 of tinned fish
8 tons of sugar leaving for Stuttgart
All this stuff for a month now.
Yeah, and ore too.
Here, get this to the radio.
Quantities sent to Germany from the 15th to the 30th.
This is London calling.
The French speaking to the French.
First, a few personal messages.
The hawthorn is in flower.
The presbytery has lost none of its charm.
Twice.
Veronese is a great painter.
The cat is out of the bag.
That's it!
They've landed!
Get the map out.
They've landed.
Where do you reckon?
This stretch is seriously at risk.
It's vulnerable to attack.
It needs reinforcing immediately.
So we use...?
- The roads.
- No, the railway.
Transport Command
Twelve trains for the western front.
What about the Apfelkern convoy?
This way?
No, not the main line. Terrorists.
They won't expect us there.
They're preparing troop transports.
They'll take the single track, not the main line.
All we'd have to do is blow up the bridge at Corbin.
It'd be great if they never got there.
Order to prepare a 12-train convoy.
The first train: S1504-322-425.
The convoy's name is Apfelkern.
- Apfelkern? What does that mean?
- Appleseed.
- What?
- Appleseed.
For Corbin.
They daren't tell us the whole route.
Excuse me.
Corbin here.
The bridge has been blown up.
The Apfelkern convoy will have to go on the main line.
Always the same!
Command post?
Convoy S1504 at 3.45 pm.
The convoy is on time.
Langres Station here.
The line has just been blown up.
Post 3. Halt convoy S1504.
No! Divert it.
Yes. Divert it via St-André.
Divert it via St-André.
- Do you understand?
- Shall I go?
- Right away.
- Now?
22nd July 1944
S1504 for 23/7
Hello, pal.
All right? Bon appétit!
Know why I'm here?
Yes, go ahead.
You got an engine here?
Yes, but not ready.
The boiler's empty.
- I can't fill it using buckets!
- Why not?
What a job!
It'll be hard work.
And I'll get shot after.
We'll tie you up.
Blame it on the Maquis.
We have to make sure the convoy doesn't get past.
But I've no one to get it going.
Unless...
There's Jules, the retired engine driver.
- Why not?
- Come on.
Don't go, Jules! They're all mad!
Can't you see he's too old?
I'm coming.
But I'll need someone to help me.
There's old Victor.
What a job!
Who did that?
We don't know.
It's Louis.
He came to blow the line.
Get a move on.
If the Germans show up, we're defenceless.
Come on.
Take out these two.
- What a job!
- Have a swig.
The wagons on line one, the engine on line two.
Now for the engine. Down you get.
- How far away is the break?
- 800 metres.
Yes, I understand.
See you, pal.
St-André Station here.
They've blown the line, and derailed an engine and 8 wagons.
- When?
- Last night.
And you tell us now?
I was tied up and they cut the phone lines.
Only three out of seven trains arrived.
Why hasn't the convoy arrived yet?
It's your responsibility.
Yes, sir!
- Repair now.
- We can't get a crane.
- There's a 30-ton crane.
- Ask for it, you'll see!
It's for you.
Weissmüller!
Where is the Apfelkern convoy?
It must arrive without fail, whatever it takes.
I'm making you responsible.
Yes, sir.
Get a 30-ton crane to St-André Station immediately, to lift a locomotive and 8 wagons.
Impossible.
We haven't got a locomotive for the crane.
I repeat!
I need a crane immediately.
We only have one stand-by engine.
That's for the convoy.
I don't care how, just get the crane there!
OK, we'll give you the stand-by engine.
It's coming.
Lower it.
How long to clear the line?
- Three hours.
- Fine.
We'll do our best.
We'll start with the first wagon.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, we'll count them.
I'm all right.
- Sabotage, sabotage!
- What can I do about it?
Clear up all this!
I'd need a 50-ton crane to lift this one.
I need another crane.
A 50-ton crane!
50 tons. Hurry!
- How long?
- I need to have a look first.
Come on.
- One, two...
- Three hours for the wagons.
This changes everything.
Well?
Even if we work all night, not before tomorrow evening.
It's impossible, we can't do otherwise.
This train has to...
Impossible!
Clear all this up!
Take that.
The bastards!
They're going to get past.
It was a good plan too.
We'll see about that.
Watch the road, by the woods there.
Watch that spot.
Everything's ready.
Hide on either side.
Hey, you lot, hurry up!
Halt!
Get this fixed right away.
Hands up!
Bastard!
Go on!
Go on, walk.
You watch over there.
And you, this side.
Get the pressure up to maximum and then get down.
What are you doing? Get down!
All right?
Yeah, fine.
We won't be getting home for a while.
You're not going to blow her up?
Never mind.
More bloody trouble!
St-André here.
A runaway train just went through!
There's a work party on the line.
I can't warn them by phone!
We've only got a few minutes.
Phone post 7, tell them to half-open the points.
It won't go any further.
Post 7.
Post 7? Half-open the points.
What? Derail the train?
Which train?
The crane?
- What are you doing?
- Never mind. Get out of here!
Just the heel broken!
That's just great!
Command post.
Post 7 here.
The train's gone through.
No derailment. Just the heel of the switch point broken.
There's a slope, but after the works.
St-André here.
The 404 just went by, at 9.13 pm.
They're still at it.
We've had the Krauts going in circles for two weeks now.
From diversion to diversion, they can't make it out of the region.
Hence the armoured train.
The only way they're safe.
But more than that...
- They're all tight together now.
- What do you mean?
I'll explain.
This is the armoured train.
Then the other trains in the convoy, as close together as possible.
The armoured train in the lead, the others following.
In front, a wagon with spare rails.
If there's a break, they stop, and they do the repair immediately.
And all the other trains follow close behind, so there's no sabotage between them.
We have to blow the armoured train, see?
Here, for you.
- What's new?
- Nothing.
What's an armoured train like?
Like a goods train.
You know what I mean.
With cattle trucks.
They put rail sleepers inside, and...
Forced labour workers behind sandbags.
Anti-tank guns?
Of course. They're well defended.
Why, are you scared?
It's not that.
Wish you were home, eh?
No, I wish the fight had started.
You want to see the Krauts?
I want to see myself.
You can never be sure of yourself.
You can be sure of this.
It'll pierce metal 10-cm thick.
A pity we only have one.
- What?
- A pity we only have one.
Hardly any reinforcements by rail, and by road they're short of petrol.
For which they can blame us.
In any case, I never delivered any!
It's taking ages.
Who's that with Masson?
Louis. The one sent from the centre with our instructions.
- Well, well!
- What?
A glow-worm. So what?
- I've never seen one before.
- No?
We don't use them for street lighting in Paris!
I've learnt some stuff over this last year.
Rye, barley, colza... Glow-worms!
Colorado beetles, green beans...
No, not like that!
What are you doing? There!
- Do you think they'll come?
- Louis wouldn't be here otherwise.
An armoured train... followed... by a convoy... S1504.
This is it! It's passed Buisson.
Watch out!
Halt!
Can we?
Get down, lads!
Damn it!
There!
Prepare to fire!
Load!
- Ready to fire.
- Good.
Ready to fire.
Good. Ready to fire.
Fire battery volley!
They're hit!
Come with me!
We can't do anything against that!
What are the others doing with their bazooka?
Pull!
A bit further!
Stop!
- Drop it!
- Watch your feet!
To the outside!
Roll it to the outside!
Roll it!
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.
I heard you wanted to see me.
Yes, but first I'd like to borrow your office, so Mr Roussel and I can finish our work.
Be my guest, sir.
So, can you tell me anything about this convoy, Apfelkern?
It's a very sorry story, sir.
Bad luck coupled with terrorist attacks.
Yes, I know.
We have the Transport
Kommandantur on our backs.
It's been going on for two weeks.
Quite a tour de force!
So it seems, from my work in the command post.
Quite a tour de force, in the opinion of my friend Castenet, who asked me to congratulate you on such good work.
Ah, Castenet...
We work together.
So it was to you he transmitted...
We can save some time.
We're going to have to work fast, and on a much larger scale.
Another 11 trains are to be diverted onto the electric network.
We need to take extreme measures.
We have to intervene between two trains.
- There's no time between them.
- There is!
It's dangerous for the crew.
Don't worry. Lampin has already done two derailings.
But he'd like the chance of killing some more Krauts.
- OK.
- Goodbye.
- Finished?
- But the left axles need checking.
- Seen Lampin?
- He's over there.
Thanks.
Did you request the 1504?
How do you know I did?
I know these sorts of things.
Careful!
That little pig has big ears!
We want to derail the first train after the armoured one.
The Krauts will never think we'll dare do it.
The only thing is, the trains are so close together that the explosives will go off as your train's passing.
You know the curve after Lissac?
That's where we'll have to do it.
I'll try.
It's all happening in Normandy.
Reinforcements mustn't arrive.
It's a question of days.
If you don't feel up to this, old pal, no one'll hold it against you.
Ten tanks less in a battle can change the outcome.
What about your mate?
He's always with me.
Remember.
At the 212-km mark.
Are you getting changed?
As you can see.
I didn't think of that.
Well, you're young.
You're smart enough already.
I left a bike tyre in my locker.
It's for my wife.
Remind me tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Hey!
If you see Rossignac, tell him I've gone.
All right.
Ready?
We're ready.
Jump to the left, not down the ravine.
Reckon we'll survive?
We'll see it through to the end, anyway.
We've had it!
- Jump!
- I can't leave you.
Jump, I said!
Who's in charge here?
Join the Maquis.
Why lose two when one can do the job?
It's over to you now.
Eleven trains in a row.
Bellay substation? Cut the current.
What? We can't do that!
Cut the current!
- Go!
- There's no current.
- Prove it!
- Phone if you don't believe me.
It's back there.
- Speak.
- There's no current.
They're going to shoot us!
Put it back on.
We'll get them later.
Restore the current.
Broken down on every line.
Take all locomotive engines to pull trains on electric lines.
Now, old pal... the locomotives!
What?
Resistance order: dump the fires!
Here! "Apfelkern troop convoy.
"Ten trains immobilised.

They've got weapons, then!
There's a Kraut convoy in retreat!
Not many trains still running.
They're stealing all the bikes!
The convoy was bombed by the English the other night.
They're running away!
Things are looking up.
Locomotive!

What the hell are they doing now?
Stop!
What's going on?
Reserved for occupation troops
Post 9 here.
A train of Germans is heading to Sarrey to blow it up.
Stop them!
I can't!
We have to save the material now.
I'll make the Germans think the Americans are there.
Let German HQ know the Americans are at Sarrey.
Switch the points.
- The Americans are at Sarrey.
- Not true!
I want to see for myself.
- Telephone.
- There.
Transport command.
Where are the Americans? In Sarrey?
So it's true!
We're going back.
Come on, move!
We've been liberated!
Nice one, lads! We beat them, eh?
St-André here.
We've hoisted the flag.
With machine-guns still firing.
Hang on...
They've fixed the rail. Listen...
The first train's about to leave.
It's been decorated.
Flags and banners all over it.
People are throwing flowers, everyone's on the platform.
Just listen...
Post 8 here.
The first train, the 122, at 2.45...
You do the first one.
Vive la France and all the railwaymen!
When a woman has lived in exciting times
and has taken part in great events,
it would seem as though those occasions would be what she remembers most vividly,
but I don't find that true at all.
I of course remember every detail of our first inaugural ball,
how I had worked to make it the brilliant affair that it was.
There were guests there from all over the world,
dignitaries, diplomats and statesmen.
I remember, too, how nervous I was.
Yet there were other times, neither happy nor gay,
when the future of our country was at stake.
We were at war. The city of Washington was under siege.
On the not too distant horizon we could see cannon fire,
and we knew that before very long,
the capital would be in the hands of the enemy.
The President was with his troops,
and we were the last group left in the White House,
gathering up the more important documents of state.
We remember the Declaration of Independence.
It would've been bitter medicine to have lost our declaration as well as our independence.
I was about ready to leave, when I looked up
and saw the portrait of our late president George Washington.
We sorely needed his military leadership at this time,
when we were in such great danger of losing everything for which he had fought.
I couldn't let the general fall into the enemy's hands at this late date,
so I cut him out of his frame, carefully,
for I had faith that in a matter of days or weeks
I would be climbing up this same ladder,
putting the general back into his place of honour,
for this I knew:
Once you've tasted freedom, you cannot live without it.
Those were exciting times,
but the memories I cherish most are the memories that are deep in my heart.
They begin at our family home in Virginia
on the night my father returned from the Revolutionary War.
My father had always liked the life on the plantation,
he liked the gaiety, the parties, the hunt.
He liked our life as it was then.
He had ordered us when he left for the war
to give the biggest party that had ever been given in our house.
He said he wanted every room lighted, so he could see it from miles away.
And this was the night he was coming home.
And we'd invited the whole countryside to welcome him.
These were kind of occasions my father loved,
gay times, good times, the life of the planter in Virginia.
We could hardly wait to see how happy he'd be
to find himself in the midst of all of his old friends.
John, what's the matter?
Nothing, Wife.
I want to thank you all for coming.
And now I have things to say to my family, if you'll excuse us, please.
Why, John!
Come!
John, are you ill?
No, my dear, I'm not ill.
But father, remember, you... you wanted us to give you a party when you returned and... and you weren't very nice to our friends.
Our true friends are not here, daughter.
It was going to be such a lovely party.
And what will they think of us?
Wouldst thou be concerned with what others think of thee more than what thou thinkest of thyself?
Do you find my speech strange to your ears, daughter?
Yes, father.
John, what happened to you?
Many things, wife.
Hast thou heard of a battle called the Battle of Kings Mountain?
Yes, we have had news of it.
It was in that battle I was wounded.
Wounded? Oh, my dear husband, why didn't you let us know?
I lay there in the fog, waiting for the end, for death.
- Poor John.
There.
In the first light of dawn, I saw a figure coming through the fog.
And he came to me.
A man I had not seen in 25 years, an old friend, one I had often gone to meetings with when I was a boy and lived in the Quaker faith.
Have I not told you of my friend John Todd?
Yes, John, you have.
He picked me up in his arms.
He said,
"Friend Payne...
"Friend Payne, that we have met this way is an act of providence."
As he bent over to bind my wounds, the enemy opened fire again, and he was struck down.
Had he not been shielding me with his body, I...
I would have taken that bullet.
He died for me, Dolly.
But he lived long enough to make a pact with me.
I pledged myself that I would return to the Quaker church.
I said I would free my slaves,
I would sell our land here and go to Philadelphia.
I told him my pledge just before he died, that our families would be joined, that our daughter would marry his son, John.
You...
You promised him, father, that... that I would be married to his son?
This was my promise to him.
But father...
I can't marry a man I...
I have never even seen.
I can't marry a man I don't even know, I don't even love.
No, father, you don't mean that.
You...
All my protests and tears did not change my father's mind.
We moved to Philadelphia and lived in a house on this square.
I was forced by father's given word
to stand up in the meeting house and marry John Todd.
In the presence of this assembly,
I take thee, Dorothea Payne, to be my wife, promising, with divine assistance, to be unto thee a loving and faithful husband until death shall separate us.
In the presence of this assembly,
I take thee, John Todd, to be my husband, promising, through divine assistance, to be unto thee a loving and faithful wife until death shall separate us.
The bride groom and the bride will now sign the marriage certificate.
Friend Todd first.
Each friend of the society will now come forward and sign the marriage certificate.
Mrs Todd...
Won't you say it now?
Say what?
- That you love me.
I'll never say it, sir.
Dolly.
- Yes, Mr Todd?
I've planned out a house.
We'll start building it in spring.
Tell me how you like it.
It's very nice.
I wish you'd come out and take a look at the grounds.
It's a beautiful place, lots of elm trees.
You've seen it,
Mr Todd, that's enough.
Well, Mrs Todd, that isn't enough, I want you to like it.
You see, this part will be built all of stone.
I haven't put the trees on the drawing, but there's a huge tree right along here which will shade the kitchen.
I think you'll feel differently about things when you get in your own house.
Your father and mother are very nice to us, very kind and understanding, but...
Well, it just isn't the same as being in your own house.
I know you'll feel differently.
- Do you?
Well, you'll feel more like you're married.
I'll never feel as if
I'm married to you, Mr Todd, and I hope you'll never feel as if you're married to me.
Now, Dolly, we're going to be married for a long, long time, all our lives, not just these five weeks we've been married, but for years, until we grow old.
I know that.
Well, someday between now and that time, you'll realise how much I love you.
And you'll love me, too,
I'm sure of it.
I'll never love you.
Just pretend you do, say you do.
Just once, see how it feels.
I'll never say it.
I'll never say, "I love you."
Yes, you will.
I know you will, you have to.
Dolly, I didn't mean to hurt you.
I'm just clumsy and awkward about things.
I know everything I do and everything I say now is wrong.
Sometimes I think I may go out of my mind,
Dolly, you hate me so much.
I never promised you anything but hate.
I know, you are right, we shouldn't have been married.
I don't blame you for the way you feel.
But I don't know what to do about it, Dolly.
If I left you,
I think I'd die thinking about you.
Dolly...
Let me put my arms around you.
I just have to.
You don't know how much I love you.
You can't know how I feel.
You've never been in love.
You've never known what it is to see all the goodness in the world in one person, and to know she's unattainable.
To know that the whole world thinks she belongs to me, and she doesn't, she never will.
It's pain, Dolly.
It's real pain.
It digs deep into you.
I look at you and I think...
There's not even pity, because you don't know, you don't understand.
And I think someday I'll take you in my arms and all the pain and ache will go out of me.
I'm ashamed.
I'm so ashamed.
Dolly, I... I've never even kissed you.
Excuse me.
- Congratulations.
Thank you.
Oh, grandfather, how are you?
- Fine.
There aren't words for the way I feel!
Dolly, are you happy now?
Look.
He's smiling.
Dolly, it's our anniversary.
But John...
Jewellery is against your belief.
Well, it isn't against yours, and I want you to be happy.
For my happiness you'd go against your belief?
Doll, I have another belief.
It's my belief in you and our marriage and our son.
That's a strong belief, too.
That's why I want to give you this present on our first anniversary.
It's been a good year, Dolly.
It's been an eventful one.
I'm embarrassed, John,
I didn't remember it was our anniversary, and I have no present for you.
Oh, yes, you have.
One present I've wanted every day for the past year.
And you're the only one who can give it to me.
A year ago, you told me you'd never say, "I love you, John."
Yes, I remember.
- And you never have.
I've been hoping someday it'd slip out, you'd forget.
Please, John, don't.
You've made me like you in spite of myself, and I'm content with our marriage.
Isn't that enough?
I can't help it if
I keep asking myself how much happier I'd be if I married a man I wanted to marry, if I hadn't been mated as the beasts in the field are mated, if I hadn't been ordered to be your wife.
But Dolly, you're the mother of our son.
Yes, I know.
I thought you'd learn to love me by now.
Love isn't something a woman learns like reading and writing.
It's something she knows by heart.
Dolly, I know that you love me.
Every instinct I have tells me you love me.
Why don't you say it?
Because it's all I have left.
Oh, I'm not complaining about my life with you, John, it's good, and... and you're good.
I love our son, and I'm glad he's here, but I miss part of my life, because you and my father took it away from me.
There's an excitement about falling in love that I'll never know.
It's a whirlwind that catches you up and transports you out of yourself into something that's more divine than mortal.
How do you know all these things?
- Every woman knows them.
Though I don't think about them often, but... sometimes when I see a boy and girl walking down the street together or when I hear that someone's getting married because she's in love, then I remember my promise to myself on our wedding day.
Oh, I know you think it's foolish, John, but somehow it makes up a little bit for what you and my father took away from me.
I'll do anything you say, John, anything.
But I'll never say it.
I'll never say, "I love you", and don't ask me to again.
You're wrong, Dolly.
Someday you'll come running to tell me you love me.
Then a plague, a horrible plague,
yellow fever swept over Philadelphia.
Father was stricken.
He died in mother's arms.
And then my little boy, our son, was taken, too.
Everyone was ordered to leave the city.
Well, Dolly, they expect me back there.
They need every man they can get to help evacuate the city,
Well, why don't you go tomorrow then, and stay here today and rest?
- They need me now.
Say, John, I'd be glad to take the ladies up to the camp.
You can ride back to the city with Luke.
Oh, fine. Thank you, Mr Evans.
Well, goodbye, Doll.
Come back to us as soon as you can, John.
Iwill.
Drive me to town, Luke, hmm?
Mrs Payne, Mr Todd has been stricken with fever.
No! Where is he?
- At the bridge.
Have you seen...
Have you seen my husband, John Todd?
John...
John...
John, I'm here.
You said, one day I'd come running to tell you I love you.
I love you, John.
I love you with all my heart.
John...
John!
Oh, no!
Now when I can, it's too late.
Oh, forgive me, my beloved, forgive me.
The next two years were bitter and lonely ones for mother and me,
but time somehow spreads a healing tissue over the deepest of wounds.
Philadelphia was the national capital in those days,
and when the congress was in session,
the city was overcrowded with the officials of the government.
The public taverns were noisy and dirty, and the food wretched.
So mother and I decided that we could be useful as well as practical.
Good afternoon, sir.
- May I see the widow Payne?
Oh, yes, sir, won't you come in?
- Thank you.
I'll tell the Widow Payne you're here, sir. - Thank you.
I hope it's a wise venture.
The thought of strange people living in our house...
There's a gentleman downstairs who wants to see the Widow Payne.
Oh, is he a lodger?
- I believe so, Miss Doll.
What's he like?
- Now, mother...
Don't forget about the price of the rooms and the rules.
The rules?
Yes, the use of spirits, the use of tobacco, and promptness at meals.
Now, be firm about it.
Doll, I can't. I wouldn't be able to say a word to him.
You go.
Me?
Amy. Amy, you talk to him. You know so much more about those things than we do.
Miss Dolly, that wouldn't be right.
All right, mother.
I'll go.
Remember to say, "This is a respectable home for respectable persons."
All right, mother.
Widow Payne?
No, I'm the widow Todd.
Widow Todd?
I've come for lodgings.
- Oh, you have?
Well, er... we plan... a respectable home for respectable people.
Yes.
And there is a rule about...
- ...not smoking in one's bed.
Yes, that's one of them.
And of course we will not permit our guests to arrive at their lodgings in that state... to which strong water brings weak men?
Nor will we allow our guests to gather in their quarters... roistering friends into pass the bottle.
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
Of course I shall need a rather large room.
Are you blushing, Widow Todd?
Is there any reason why I should, sir?
I don't know. Women's blushes are a great mystery to all men.
After all, we were not expecting applicants quite so soon.
The sign has just gone up.
I just took it down and threw it in the fire.
I saw the boy with it half a mile away and followed him here.
You won't need it anymore.
Do you have a good cook?
Yes, we have...
- And a place to stay for my horses?
Yes, there's a stable...
- Do you like horses?
Yes, I like them very much.
You are blushing, widow Todd.
Do you have references?
Personal, political or financial?
Personal and financial.
Blushing again, widow Todd.
Mother.
This is my mother, the widow Payne.
I am Senator Aaron Burr, madam, your obedient servant.
Senator Aaron Burr of New York?
- The same.
You don't mind having a senator in your house, I hope?
I would be honoured, senator.
- Then I have one vote.
Widow Todd, if I promised not to try out my speeches on you, won't you say yes, too?
Well, I'm afraid I have to, senator.
After all, you took down our sign.
That's because I hope to have the privilege of finding other suitable lodgers for you.
How many do you plan to take in?
Four.
- Four.
That'll be three beside myself.
Shall we say the French charge d'affaires and maybe one cabinet member and a judge or another senator?
Sounds like a most distinguished company, senator.
I'll do my best.
May I see my quarters now, widow Todd?
Certainly, sir.
Right this way.
Oh, Amy...
Amy, would you show senator Burr to the master bedroom, please?
Senator Burr?
Well, bless your soul.
Come right this way, senator.
Just think!
Cabinet members, foreign ministers, judges, and senator Burr.
Doll, it is a good beginning, isn't it?
I hope so, mother.
Oh, what a fine horse!
He's yours then.
Oh, thank you, you're very kind, but
I couldn't accept such a wonderful gift.
Well, if you won't, I'll have to turn him out or shoot him.
Oh, you wouldn't do that.
You know, I would if you wouldn't accept him.
I believe you might.
Come on, boy, run for your life. Come on.
I like living in your house.
Mother will be very pleased when I tell her that.
Mother?
Aren't you pleased?
Well, it's very flattering to know that the lodger likes his lodgings.
Oh, I'm not talking about the lodgings,
I'm talking about you.
Hows the sketch coming?
Oh, you widows are too experienced in fending people off.
That's very good.
You're wrong, widow Todd.
There's no softness in the hair, and the eyes haven't that right kind of blue... they are blue, aren't they?
The lips haven't that full...
I just wanted to seal our bargain.
About the horse, you said you'd take him.
Indeed I did. And I think it best that I start taking him home right now.
Widow Todd?
Shall I bring the sketch?
It's not a very big rock, and I can push it along the road for losing my bet.
- What bet?
When I first saw you walking down the stairs in your house,
I foolishly bet myself that within one week I'd kiss you, and this is my last day.
How very odd.
When I saw you, I bet that our first lodger would be much too much of a gentleman to try such tavern tricks.
That's sad. Then we both lose our bets.
It's very unlucky to start a long friendship like that.
It is, really.
Thank you.
You're a beautiful creature.
Thank you for a very nice ride.
You at least have made a conquest.
Jack, be sure to cool him off well. - Yes, sir.
Well, James... the horse kick you?
No, Aaron, why?
- You look as though you're in pain.
That look might be either deep passion or a bad toothache.
Still, it's always difficult to tell from
Madison's face what is going on in Madison's mind.
I was wondering if I know that lady.
I don't think so, James.
Well, I wish I did.
She's the mistress of a lodging house just around the corner.
I promise you, the first chance I get, I'll present you.
Good day, James.
- Good day.
I've found a friend.
Great pleasure to have you in our home, gentlemen.
Madam, this seems like a heavenly dream.
Ah, they've come back.
Count!
So you got my message.
- And came post-haste.
Well, Ainsworth, is it all I said it was? - All that and more.
Let me present my two friends who've come to live in your home.
First, Count D'Arignon, the French charge d'affaires to the United States.
And my colleague, senator Ainsworth.
- It's a great pleasure, gentlemen.
I'd like to see senator Burr, please.
Yes, sir, won't you come in?
- Thank you.
Quite a change from the White Horse Tavern.
For the first time since I left France,
I feel as if I have a home, madame.
Excuse me, senator Burr.
There's a gentleman to see you.
Oh, yes. Show him in, Amy.
I'm expecting him.
That's your new lodger.
Judge Sears of the Supreme court.
Judge who?
- Judge Sears.
You're wrong, Aaron.
It's only your humble servant.
Well, James, you really are a man of action.
Yes, I just happened to be passing by, and I thought maybe this was a good chance to present me to, er...
Yes, erm... Mrs Payne, this is congressman James Madison.
He's asked to be presented.
I'm honoured, Mr Madison.
- How do you do?
He's a bachelor, but the father of the constitution.
Mrs Todd, Mr Madison.
- How do you do?
Are you the James Madison of Virginia? - Yes, I am.
My husband used to read me your articles on the Federalists.
I thought they were magnificent.
You did?
- Yes.
Well, I thought they were pretty good myself.
When James says he thinks that something is pretty good, he means it's almost perfect.
It is nice to see someone from Virginia, Mr Madison.
We lived in Virginia until just a few years ago.
You can feel that the moment you walk into this house.
Mrs Todd, I was wondering, have you room for one more lodger here?
Have we, mother?
Well, I had rather promised senator
Burr I'd hold the room for Judge Sears.
Well, er... don't you think that since
Mr Madison is here and Judge Sears isn't, we might forget about the judge?
But after all, a judge of the Supreme court is quite a useful thing to have around.
But a fellow Virginian is a fellow Virginian.
Well, thank you. Now, if you'll forgive me, I'll fetch my luggage.
You never would suspect that that quiet, gentle man is the great James Madison, would you?
No.
But your cousin Patrick Henry doesn't think he's such a quiet, gentle man.
Well, you Virginians really do stick together, don't you?
When I saw that look of disappointment on his face,
I didn't have the heart to turn him away.
If he'd heard you say that, he would've run a mile.
He's very shy around the ladies.
Here's Judge Sears now.
And you, widow Todd, will have the pleasure of telling him that you've given away his room to a mere congressman.
I just happened to have my luggage outside.
So we see.
Excuse me, can I get you something, Mr Madison?
Thank you.
Dolly will be down in just a moment, senator.
Than you, Mrs Payne.
I hope you won't be late for the play.
- No, we have plenty of time.
Why don't you move your queen? You could put him in check.
You're right, Aaron, but I never like to see my queen in danger.
You look lovely, widow Todd.
- Thank you, senator.
Good night, mother.
- Have a good time at the play.
We will, dear.
Thank you.
I'm sorry I won't be able to see the end of your game, gentlemen.
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Goodnight.
C'est a' vous dejouer.
- What?
I think it is your move, Monsieur.
Yes, yes, I guess it is at that.
What is the play to be about?
Oh... usual nonsense.
This is the first time I've been to the theatre since we moved to Philadelphia.
You're in one every day of your life. All the world's a stage.
This is not the theatre, Mr Burr.
No, this is a tavern, but you'll find it much more amusing than the theatre.
Evening, colonel Burr.
- Evening, Randy.
Just wait, sir.
Aaron Burr.
The man we want as president of the US. - That's right, senator.
Well, the politicians may have something to say about that.
Colonel, when the time comes, we won't worry about politicians, will we, boys?
- No, we'll follow Burr.
Wine has made you eloquent.
- Where you lead, Mr Burr, we follow.
A pint for Thomas.
I'll remember that, Thomas.
Take good care of the colonel, Tessie. - Yes, sir.
How do you do, senator?
- Hello, Jake.
Any French wine tonight?
- Yes, colonel.
Why did you bring me to this place? - I thought you'd like it.
These people are much more amusing than those players on the stage.
They're different certainly.
Would you like to leave and go on to the theatre?
No.
- Don't tell me, widow Todd, that you're beginning to find the dark side of the street attractive.
I don't know, Mr Burr.
There's a note of excitement about you, and somehow it seems to be echoed by these people here.
In this room is every kind of evil hunger that the Gods invented.
There's hunger wealth, for power, for danger, for adventure.
What is your evil hunger, Mr Burr?
You think I have one?
- You're not an ordinary man.
I'll drink to that.
And to the hidden streams of life and the dark places to which they flow.
To you, widow Todd.
No, Bryan! No!
Move the tables back.
Mandy? Lock the doors.
Sit still.
He's hurt.
Pick it up with your left hand.
Pick it up, or
I'll run you through!
You let her alone!
From now on it gets a little rough, so I'll take you out through that door that leads to the courtyard.
If you see the watch, keep going alone.
Open up and be searched.
Why are we stopping?
I think our borrowed steed is rather short of wind. We ought to give him a breather.
I think I need one, too.
Have you had enough excitement for one evening?
Enough for a good many.
We'll look upon the whole thing as a visit to the theatre.
You have a very odd way of making danger attractive.
Have I?
Goodnight.
Good morning.
Oh, good morning, Mr Madison.
This must be an important day in the congress.
What makes you say that?
You look like a man who's about to pass a law.
What do you think of the... Here, let me.
Oh, thank you.
What do you think of the lawmakers that you've met, Miss Dolly?
They're not as wise as friends claim, nor as stupid as their enemies report. - Yes.
Somehow I feel they're just about like everybody else.
You're right, no better and no worse.
Dolly... I mean, Miss Todd,
I've been thinking of a little plan that concerns you.
Me?
- Yes.
I have a bill before congress which prohibits any American from engaging in the operation of slaveships.
Well, that sounds like a wonderful bill. Will they pass it?
No, not unless I can convince the opposition that liberty and slavery can never live hand in hand.
You sound like my father the day he set his slaves free.
He told them,
"I'm not doing this for you, nor for myself,"
"nor to serve my own conscience."
"I'm doing this because our nation that has just been born"
"will be stronger when all men are free."
Would you tell them that tomorrow night, just as you said it to me?
Tomorrow night?
Ah, I forgot. I haven't told you about my plan.
Now you said that lawmakers are just like everybody else.
Oh! The flowers look lovely, Doll.
- Aren't they pretty?
Now let me see...
The Vermont and
Massachusetts men will be here.
The ladies will be
South Carolina and Virginia.
Mrs Tillson, Maryland,
Mrs Makin, Pennsylvania,
New York, New Jersey and Delaware.
I think they'll mix very nicely.
Oh, Amy. Be sure that everything that comes out of the kitchen is very hot.
Get things on the table as fast as possible.
They can be more leisurely clearing off the table.
How many girls did you get?
- Three, Miss Dolly, for the table. And myself.
That's fine, Amy.
As soon as the men get seated, take the flowers off the table.
Men don't like to talk over flowers.
I think they enhance the picture.
They slow down the conversation.
My idea of a good party is where everybody talks at once.
Be sure that the gentlemen have extra-thick cuts of roast.
Oh, yes, maam.
Now, I'll go up and get some rest, and you'd better do the same, mother.
Amy.
Please say a little prayer that Mr Madison's supper party does all the things he wants it to do.
Miss Dolly, I can't say a prayer over just a supper party!
You can over this one, Amy.
Indeed you can.
Port and cigars for the gentlemen, Amy.
We'll have to talk Madison into this quite frequently.
I didn't think he had it in him.
Mr Madison is from Virginia, gentlemen.
There's nothing he enjoys more than his little suppers with his friends.
What I can't understand, Mr Madison, is why a charming gentleman like yourself has never married.
Neither can I, sir.
You now that women have a lot more wisdom than most men think.
I've never met one that would have me.
You come to my house on the 25th.
I'll show you six, all of them young and pretty.
Now, six seems a good many wives to start out with.
I think I'd rather start out with just one, like most of the gentlemen I know.
Oh, Mr Madison!
Isn't he droll?
I know the one I'd choose if I were you, sir.
You do, ma'am?
There's one thing I know nothing about. That's politics.
But I never will forget my father saying it.
"I'm not doing this for you, nor to serve my own conscience,"
"but because our new-born nation will be stronger when all men are free."
I liked it because it made the United
States seem like a little pink and white baby with a blue bonnet on.
Ladies... ladies, shall we leave the gentlemen to their port and cigars?
Oh... I'm sorry.
Gentlemen.
When this bill comes up, all
I'll remember will be this supper.
You know how my vote will go.
I hope it will go the right way, sir. - Goodnight.
Mr Madison. - Goodnight, my dear. Have a lovely evening.
I'll see you later, James.
I see things more clearly now.
We need some good, clear thinking on this bill. Goodnight.
Oh, Dolly, it was a lovely party.
Even though I shouldn't say it, I had a wonderful time.
Ladies, I want to thank you.
I'll never be able to say the things I want to say.
I couldn't say them if I stood here all night.
You know, I worked on those men for months.
I buttonholed them in corridors, I plagued them in taverns, and all I ever got was, "No."
And tonight?
And tonight, Dolly, this little supper party and the things you said and the things you made them say may be just the thing we need to pass the bill tomorrow.
That would be nice, Mr Madison.
It may be the first step in the fight against slavery.
Do you really think it has a chance of passing?
It may, it may, it may.
And if it becomes the law, Dolly, it will be your law.
My law?
- Yours and nobody else's.
Oh...
Oh, I... I never felt so important in all my life.
I'll be back in a moment.
Oh, you startled me, Aaron.
Is that all?
Then I'll do it again.
Did your supper make history?
It went off very well, thank you, sir.
It can only mean that Mr Madison had another dull and totally unnecessary law ready to be passed.
It's a very good bill, Aaron.
I know the salve trade act is not only impractical, but is quite impossible to enforce.
But if it is enforced, it may mean the beginning of the end of slavery.
I know every phrase and syllable on it, and it won't work.
Come on, we're going to the Clinton ball.
Oh, I couldn't stand another party tonight.
- And see how politics really are played.
All right, I'll get my gloves and shawl.
It'll help you to get the dull taste of congressman out of your mouth, too.
Mrs Todd, may I present my friends.
Senator and Mrs Mason.
- How do you do?
Governor and Mrs Trubshaw.
- Delighted.
And Mr Justice Drake.
- It is indeed an honour.
Good evening, Senator.
- Senator?
Sir, you mean the next president of the United States.
Yeah...
You're the first to put in words what everybody knows.
Gentlemen, these good wishes are deeply appreciated, even though they are a trifle premature.
Now, when one has the good fortune to dance with Mrs Todd, only a fool would waste time talking politics.
Goodbye.
I can't believe that I know the man who's to be the next President of the United States.
And a very different kind of president he'll be, too.
Oh, I'm sure of that.
No, I'm serious, Dolly.
When I was in Europe last year,
I couldn't help wondering what would happen if a really strong power, one with great armies and navies, attacked this country.
I think we'd raise greater armies, the way we did during the Revolutionary War.
Ah, that time we were lucky.
Next time we have to be strong.
There's too much talk about democracy these days and too little purpose in rule.
We need a president who can pull the states together and make them into a real nation in spite of themselves.
If I were a man,
I think I'd love politics.
Instead of politicians?
There's something very special about sunday, about the sunshine.
The way people look as they stroll along, families together, young men and young ladies, seems to be the best day of the week for everybody.
You didn't like Philadelphia when you first came here, did you?
No.
I miss the life in Virginia.
But there's so much of me here now.
I wish I had those first few years here to live over again.
I wasn't very wise about my marriage, Mr Madison.
I didn't realise how much it meant to me until it was all over.
I heard John Todd was a fine man.
He was.
He made me very happy.
But I was extremely wilful.
I have many regrets, Mr Madison.
Well, you can't live with regrets. - I know that.
And there's a good deal of happiness still left in the world.
I suppose everybody has said,
"lf I had my life to live over again,"
"how differently I would live it."
- Yes, I'm sure of that.
I've said it often.
And should I marry again,
I'd try to make up for all the things I failed to do for John.
Are you thinking about marrying again?
Every widow thinks about marrying again, Mr Madison.
I had hoped that you would be.
Had you?
- Yes.
This time, I must be deeply in love before my marriage.
I know now the part a wife should play in a husband's life.
I think you should marry a man because he wants you more than anything else in the world, because he wants you to be a part of his plans, his ambition, and his work.
No matter how difficult a task he sets out to do, you make it possible for him to do it.
I hope he'll need me.
That's one thing I must be certain, that my husband needs me.
He needs you, Dolly.
Sometimes I'm positive that he needs no one but himself.
Then other times, he seems so alone, as though he needed someone very badly.
I hope you'll forgive me for speaking so frankly, but you are his friend, and there are times when I feel
I know you better than I do Mr Burr.
You seem to understand me.
I suppose it's because we're both from Virginia.
Yes. I suppose that's the reason.
Well, shall we walk a bit? - Yes, James.
Er, tell Mrs Todd the horses are outside, Amy.
Mrs Todd is having tea with
Mr Madison and another gentleman.
Oh, senator, won't you come and have a cup of tea?
You know Mr Jefferson.
- Yes, indeed. How are you, Thomas?
It's nice to see you, Aaron.
- I don't suppose you've heard the news.
News? ls there news?
Mr Jefferson has been named to run against Mr Adams for the presidency.
Well, congratulations, Thomas.
And congratulations to you, too, James,
I feel that you must've had a hand in this.
Two hands, Aaron. No man did more to get me the nomination.
I wish I deserved that compliment.
Let's drink to Mr Jefferson.
Yes.
A toast in tea.
Symbolic of that party in Boston that makes it possible for any man to offer himself as the leader of his people.
To you, Mr Jefferson.
- Thank you, Aaron.
I'm glad that Jefferson was nominated instead of me.
Are you?
Now Adams will win the election,
Jefferson will be out of the way, so will your friend Madison.
Don't you like Mr Madison?
No, I'm jealous.
- Oh, Aaron...
Well, not really, but those adoring glances, haven't you noticed them?
I know he's fond of me.
Fond of you? He's madly in love with you. So am I.
Why do you keep James dangling around?
- I don't.
I like him. I like his ideals.
His ideals!
They're the same as Jefferson's.
You don't really think that men like that can run these so-called United States, do you?
Well, of course I do.
- They can't. History proves that.
Where the people rule, they're ruined.
This country will never become a nation until the power to rule is in proper hands.
The United States are a long way from being united.
You yourself fought to make this country a free nation.
I'm still fighting to make it a nation, not a collection of tribes.
That's what it is now.
New England and the southern states beat out the tom-toms over the tariff,
New York and Pennsylvania hold war dances and yell against the taxes.
Every so-called citizen wants everything for himself and to leave nothing for the other man.
A country so divided and a people so selfish makes a very tempting dish.
Aaron, that's no way to take defeat. - Defeat?
I'm not defeated.
And when this union of states breaks up, I'll pick up the pieces.
Jefferson and Madison can have their day now,
I'll have mine later.
Not that way, Aaron, no.
I'll preach freedom and rebellion in the same breath,
I'll lead and the rebel will follow, and in the end I'll rule.
I'll rule without election,
I'll rule without congress.
Aaron, that's treason.
You shouldn't talk like that.
Too many men have died for our liberty.
Treason? You may call it treason, but I call it destiny.
Your destiny and mine.
Aaron, you frighten me when you talk like that.
I'm going to rule this country alone.
Only you will be at my side, always.
Have you got the carriage? - Yes.
Might I suggest you redraft the bill?
I'll think about it.
Dolly, this is a surprise!
Have you been in the gallery, listening to the debates?
- No, James.
Fisher Ames and Guiles put on quite a show. I thought they'd never finish.
Is there somewhere
I may speak to you?
I mean, privately.
- Why, of course.
Sit down right here.
No one will disturb us.
Hadn't we better go somewhere else?
I know women are not supposed to come in here.
No, no, it's all right.
Nobody will mind.
You seem troubled, Dolly.
Sit down.
I am troubled.
I'm troubled about something that women are not supposed to be concerned with at all.
I thought a woman's hand was always needed when there was a problem to be solved.
Even in politics?
- Yeah.
Yes, there have been women involved in politics,
Cleopatra, Du Barry, old Queen
Elizabeth, you're not alone in history.
Then my coming here to talk politics doesn't seem strange to you?
No, I think it's delightful.
Have you a bill you want me to sponsor?
No, I'm afraid I have a lot of questions.
Well, that's good.
There's no better place for a citizen to ask questions than in the hall of Congress.
James, isn't it true that man's effort to be free has always failed?
Yes.
Yes, that's been the record for the past 8.000 years, up until now.
Are you afraid we'll fail again?
I don't know.
Is that a bad thing to say?
- I don't think so.
I often ask myself that.
I have doubts, too, very often.
But then I tell myself,
"This is the last great hope of man, and we can't let it fail."
But it is in danger, isn't it?
- Yes.
I sometimes wonder how we had the courage to fight for it.
Maybe it's something in the American soil, some kind of strength that comes up to men.
Maybe it's something in the air, clear and heady, that makes us want to be free.
But whatever it is, we have it and we'll keep it, if the people want it.
That's just it.
Some people don't want it.
They want a ruler. They want advantages for themselves.
They want to take away from the many and give power to the few.
No, no, some people want that.
But they're not people who understand freedom.
How would you define freedom,
James? What do you say it is?
I don't know.
If I were called upon here by the representatives of the people, my colleagues, to define freedom, now what would I say?
I'd say freedom is the right of every man to look upon every other man and say,
"I'm no better than you are, and you're no better than I am.
"I'm not yours, and you're not mine,"
"but together we can be the strongest of all men."
"Together we can make laws to settle our disputes."
"Together we can devise and work out a way of life"
"that will be good for all of us."
"This was the reason we fought to be free,"
"and this is the way we live in freedom." ls there some question from the member?
Yes, there is.
What will happen if this idea of freedom were attacked by a strong enemy?
I only know I've had one glimpse of freedom, and now I can't live without it.
And I and all men like me will die fighting those who try to shut it off.
You have doubts,
I have them, too, but I also have this, and I'll give it to you.
That this blessed dream of free men governed by their own laws will take shape and grow, Dolly, until it includes all people, all races, all kinds, all together.
This is all I have, this blessed dream, it's all I have to offer to still your doubts.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make a speech.
Oh, James, it's all so clear to me now.
You're not crying?
No.
No, I'm not crying.
I know something now it seems I've always known.
I know now, James, that...
I love you.
I've been trying to say those same words to you since the first day I saw you.
And now I didn't even have to propose.
No man has ever made a more beautiful proposal.
See here, you two. This table is for making laws, not for making love.
It's all right, Hugo.
Oh, forgive me, Mr Madison,
I didn't know.
I never dreamed.
Neither did I.
I want you to have this necklace now, and you're to wear it for the first time at your wedding.
It was your great-grandmothers.
Oh, I remember this.
You used to wear this in Virginia.
Only on great occasions.
Oh, it's a wonderful present.
Thank you, mother.
I couldn't give it to you the last time, but this time you must have a beautiful wedding.
I think I can brag of you to our friends.
"Dolly", I'll say,
"is married to James Madison,"
"a truly great man."
Yes, he is, mother.
His love is the kind that will last forever.
And his life and his dreams are the kind that a woman can really share.
Er, what does Aaron Burr think about this, Doll?
I haven't told him yet.
But I will tonight.
I thought we might take supper out tonight.
I'd like to be spared the sight of Madison smugly denying that he engineered
Jefferson's nomination.
We could go someplace where we're not known.
Aaron...
I'd like to tell you something.
Not about politics, I hope?
No, it's about us.
What do you want to tell me?
Well, I hope you'll understand this.
It's not very easy to explain.
I guess when things like this happen, they are always a little...
What are you trying to say?
I'm going to marry James Madison.
I knew it.
Yesterday on the hill, I knew it.
No, Aaron, I didn't know until today myself.
Why are you doing this?
- Because I love him. I love him very deeply.
I'm sorry, but...
- You're sorry!
That's very touching, widow Todd, but you'll be more sorry as time goes on. - Aaron, you're hurting me.
Think I'll fail? Have you lost faith in me? - No, please, Aaron...
Let me go.
You'll never forget me, Dolly, if you marry a dozen Madisons.
And I'll never forget you.
Never.
James Madison and I were married.
After the election, when our friend Tom
Jefferson lost the presidency to John Adams,
my husband and I moved to Virginia,
where James was a member of the Virginia legislature.
We spent four wonderful and happy years on his family estate.
 Dolly!
- Yes?
Look, we have some visitors.
- Look, they can get their eyes open.
You know what his name is? - No.
John Adams.
- Why?
Well, look at him.
Mr Madison, sir.
- Oh, yes, fella.
This came by courier from Washington, sir.
Oh, good. Thank you.
It's from Tom Jefferson.
- Oh, I hope he's coming to visit us.
He's one person I'd love to see.
He wants us to visit him.
He's going to run for president again. - That is good news.
He says, "You must come to
Washington and help me campaign."
I could close the house in a very few days.
"...going to be an exciting campaign."
He has Aaron Burr running for his vice president.
He says that should ensure
New York and Massachusetts.
But Tom and Aaron seem to be such strange running mates.
Yes, old Tom's probably swung
Burr around to his way of thinking.
This last paragraph is for you.
"Dolly, I'm counting on you to keep things running smoothly."
Now what are you thinking up?
I was just thinking how happy we've been here in Montpelier these past four years.
Oh, we'll come back here after the election.
Jefferson will make our country a model for every nation on earth.
He has to win this election, Doll.
And you want to help him, don't you, James?
Yes, I do. All I can.
And I want to help you, all I can.
We had moved to Washington,
and now that the campaign was over,
we were spending our fifth wedding anniversary alone,
as we had planned.
James!
That's the most beautiful fan I've ever seen.
Why not? It's for the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
Yes, very useful things, fans.
Open your present.
- Oh, yes.
Yes. Now let me...
A snuff box?
Well, Dolly, you're really trying to make a dandy out of me, aren't you?
Don't you like it?
- Oh, I certainly do.
Oh, you'd better. I had to go all the way to New York for it.
Well, it's overwhelming.
I'm going to make a point of offering snuff to everybody in the capital, so they can... admire it.
And I shall blush modestly behind my fan at your elegance.
Which reminds me, I must have a new gown and turban made to match my beautiful gift.
Of course now I have to have new
Waistcoats to house this beautiful object.
You'll be the centre of attraction, my dear husband.
Mr Madison, please, sir.
Mr Wilson and Mr Quinnan, some other gentlemen, to see you.
Tell them to come in, please.
This is the evening we were going to spend alone.
Public life and private plans seldom walk together.
They may not stay very long.
Don't ask them for supper. - I won't.
They probably came by to tell us about the electoral college vote. Gentlemen?
Mr Madison, we've been tricked. - Tricked?
Jefferson and Burr are tied.
Seventy-three votes for each. Here's the calculation.
You mean the election will go to the
House of Representatives for a decision?
It will indeed, ma'am.
- And there is danger there for us.
We're about to sit in council with
Mr Jefferson on this matter tonight.
Gentlemen, I'll see you in a few moments.
I'm sorry, Doll.
This is a poor end to our little celebration.
Maybe we should've stayed in Virginia.
James, you must not let
Aaron Burr be named president.
I feel this is my fault in a way.
I wrote the election law.
Burr found a loophole.
I didn't write a very good law, Doll.
I tell you, I have a feeling about it.
When the House votes, we'll defeat Jefferson two to one.
Two to one, gentlemen!
I swear it won't be less than that, Aaron.
Or should I say Mr president?
All we need is nine more votes.
Nine votes, and Jefferson buried in the vice presidency once again.
A fate he richly deserves.
Mr Alexander Hamilton, sir.
Tell him I'm not here.
Mr Burr?
I hope you'll pardon my presence, but my business is urgent.
And private.
No, please stay, gentlemen.
Yes, Mr Hamilton?
I'm here to ask you again to stop this folly and end this farce and to notify the House of Representatives that you ran for the vice presidency, not for the presidency.
And why should they believe me any more than they believe you?
Your claim to the presidency, Mr Burr, is distasteful, dishonest, and personally repugnant to decent men.
And how do men like yourself feel about it?
Aaron Burr, whatever influence I have,
I shall use against you at this time.
And any time in the future that you are presumptuous enough to run for public office,
I shall oppose you.
Have you all heard enough?
- Mm-hmm.
So have I. Jason, show Mr Hamilton to the door and then open the window.
Won't you all join me?
You turned him out!
And you did it beautifully,
Mr president, beautifully.
I don't think he'd never swing the federalist vote for Jefferson.
I don't know. He may be meddlesome, but he's clever.
We must find a way to offset him.
Let me think now.
Aaron, if I were you, I would go to the city of Washington as soon as possible.
I'd talk to every congressman down there.
This thing needs just a little horse-trading, and I think you can trade horses better than Hamilton.
My, oh my, oh my, why didn't I think of that?
I'll sleep on it and let you know in the morning.
A trip to Washington this time of year might be very pleasant.
Hamilton will try to swing New York and may pick up a few votes.
The Federals will hold the line, they hate Jefferson.
Everyone hates him.
They hate Madison, too.
What about John Marshall?
Do you mind if we discuss this in the morning instead of tonight?
Oh, certainly.
- Certainly, Mr president.
Jason will show you to the door.
- Yeah, we were just leaving.
Aaron, I don't know what you'll think of me for coming here like this, but I had to see you for a few minutes.
- I dreamt of you in every room in this house.
I know what you think of a woman meddling in politics.
But I can't let you go on doing what you're doing without pleading with you to change your course.
You look exactly the same.
What course?
This pretention to the presidency.
Pretention?
Madison send you here?
- No, Aaron.
Don't tell me you're running errands for Mr Jefferson.
No one knows I'm here.
- Why did you come then?
Aaron, once you told me that you loved me.
Once?
I thought I told you more often than that.
I also told you I was gonna become the President of the United States, and as I recall, you were very happy to know the man who might gain that high office.
Now you're here to gain political advantage for your husband.
I'm here because this is more important than my husband or Mr Jefferson or you or me.
Speak for your own side, madam.
It's very important for me.
So important, in fact, that I'm going to
Washington tomorrow to ensure its success.
To influence the House vote by trading and truckling with men you despise.
Aaron, that's sneaking into the presidency by the back door.
Serve your four years as vice president.
Mr Jefferson did it. Mr Adams did it.
You can only add to your political strength by doing the same.
At this moment, I'm stronger than Mr Jefferson.
I'm stronger than
Madison and Hamilton, too.
Then why do you cheapen yourself by going to Washington to buy and beg votes?
Cheapen myself?
Dolly, to prove to you that this is my destiny, I won't go to Washington.
I won't lift a finger to further my own cause.
Does that make you happier?
Thank you, Aaron.
I know why you're here.
You won't admit it to yourself right now.
You keep saying,
"That's all over, that's done with."
But it will never be over between us, Dolly, never done with.
Aaron, I don't want you to say these things.
I'll always say them.
And when my day comes,
I'll find some way to have you at my side.
Goodbye, Aaron.
Aaron Burr did yield,
and Thomas Jefferson was inaugurated President of the United States.
He appointed my husband Secretary of State.
Mr Jefferson asked
James and me to go with him
on his first official inspection of the president's house.
To my astonishment, he said he had a job for me, too.
He was a widower and wanted me to become
the official hostess of
Washington City and the president's house.
I was delighted, of course, but in no way prepared for what I was to find
when Mrs John Adams opened the front door for us.
The contractor had promised to finish the president's house many months before,
but materials were scarce, good workmen hard to find,
and through somebody's bad judgement,
the house had been built in the midst of a swamp.
Mrs Adams led us to the kitchen
to show us the three feet of water covering the floor.
The East Room, the great and magnificent ballroom for entertaining European royalty,
was unfinished, unpainted,
with an enormous line of wash hanging from one end to the other.
Standing in the midst of all this confusion, Mr Jefferson gave me my assignment.
I was to make the president's house warm, beautiful and friendly,
so that every American would feel it was his unofficial home.
It was the most difficult assignment I had ever had,
but Mr Jefferson was not a man you failed.
It was not too long before the work was done,
and we were giving lovely parties.
Oh, Dolly.
I was just telling Jonathan, the four of us ought to try and arrange a little trip Virginia right after the session.
I'd love it.
Wouldn't you, James?
James can't take any trips to Virginia.
Jefferson won't let him get out of Washington.
There's plenty of reason to stay here right now, especially for the man
Jefferson's picked to succeed him.
Jonathan, don't say things like that.
James has no ambition to succeed Mr Jefferson.
That is the truth.
Now, don't try to pull the wool over my eyes, James.
Any man in the United States would like to be president.
Mr Aaron Burr!
The Vice president of the United States.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Mr President.
Mr Burr.
- Mr Vice President.
Mr Secretary.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
Mr President, I'd like to look around a little.
Certainly, Mr Burr.
I might even find a friend here.
Aaron Burr. At last you come to one of my parties.
Hostess to the president.
What a magnificent title for you, widow Todd.
Well, it is a rather difficult task at times, but I manage to...
But an easy one to get, I'm sure.
All you had to do is to persuade me to step aside for Jefferson and tell him and be rewarded.
I stepped down and you stepped up.
Aaron, no one, not even my husband, knows I went to New York to see you.
I'll never tell him, madam.
I wouldn't want him to know how big a fool I've been.
Did you come here tonight just to humiliate me, to say things you know are not true?
I came here to tell you that what you and Jefferson and Madison robbed me of,
I'll get myself.
You may plan, and Madison may dream, it will do you no good.
Thomas Jefferson will be the last President of the United States.
That's irresponsible, Aaron.
You must end this suspicion, this madness.
This madness?
You know me better than that, Dolly.
What I start out to do, I do.
When it's done, you'll be the first to know.
Till then, Mrs Madison.
This is a tragic circumstance, James.
With your permission, sir.
- Certainly.
Did Burr tell you about his duel with Alexander Hamilton?
Duel? No, what happened?
Courier just brought word they fought with pistols.
Burr killed him.
Oh, no!
- Yes.
Well, Ned, have you come along for the fun?
Well, colonel,
I always did want to see Mexico.
You'll see plenty of it if you follow me, soldier.
They still think we're going to attack Mexico. - That's all they talk about.
Blennerhassett's learning Spanish, the fool.
He won't have much opportunity for that in Washington.
It'll come in handy at the embassy dinner.
I thought he'd catch on by now.
You know, Jedson, you and
I are the only ones who know that we're going to war with the United States.
Now, our advisors are waiting.
That's agreed then.
We move down the river to the great gulf and then west and on to Mexico.
To Mexico, empire and glory.
But are you sure the United States army will be at war with Spain before then?
I'm quite sure. I'm also certain that we shall pick up followers by the tens of thousands.
It's government troops.
They're on their way here.
Hear that? It's government troops.
- Wait till the old man hears this!
Sounds like bad news.
Might be trouble.
Colonel, government troops are headed this way under a forced march.
Government troops?
Who wants the honour of firing the first shot at them?
But Colonel Burr, he said they're government troops.
Politicians troops. Politicians who are trying to spoil our plans.
The hour has come.
We'll give them more than they bargained for, won't we, men?
We'll meet them on road tonight.
One good ambush, and they'll scatter like leaves in the storm.
Company commander, sound assembly.
Colonel Burr.
Yes, captain, didn't you understand my order?
Yes, colonel. But I joined you for foreign conquest, not to fight the United States.
Nor did my men.
And I'll not order them to ambush any soldier under the flag of my own country.
Captain, we pick no fight with them, they've come here to fight us.
But colonel, couldn't we parley with them, get an explanation or give one?
The only explanation they understand is hot lead and plenty of it, and we're the ones to give it to them, aren't we, men?
That's treason you're talking.
Treason, is it?
- Yes, sir. Treason and rebellion.
Soldier, I'll tell you one thing, and the rest of you, listen to me.
You here with the thousands who have flocked to our banners can beat these troops of the government if you have the courage to do so.
Follow where I lead, and in one month, you and I, all of us here, will be the rulers of the United States.
If we win this first battle, we can win them all.
Listen to me.
Hold these men.
They must listen.
We can win.
Come back, you must hear me.
I have a plan. A plan to take all the southern states.
And I have friends, powerful friends.
Friends who are waiting for us to march in.
Listen to me!
Come back and listen, you cowards!
You're throwing away an empire.
You're a good barber, Jenks.
Thank you, Mr Burr.
Thank you.
They don't really think I'm going to commit suicide, do they?
Well, some do, you know?
A fellow about three years ago did on the day they were going to hang him.
I done his hair the night before.
Done it real pretty, too.
- They're a long way from hanging me.
Mr Burr, you're gonna have a new barber from now on.
Why? Are they gonna hang you?
No, I'm getting out.
Out of jail, and out of Richmond, too.
Going back up to
New Jersey, where I belong.
Jenks.
Do you go through
Washington on your way home?
I suppose so. It's just as close that way as any other.
I have a letter
I want you to deliver for me.
I'll give you $100 in gold.
And enough for your stage fare besides.
Mr Burr, I'm your man.
- Good.
Deliver it to no one but the lady herself. - Yes, sir.
I told the gentleman you got scores of letters every day, and they was delivered right in my hands.
But he said this is something different.
I'm Mrs Madison. - A gentleman in jail gave me a letter for you.
He asked me to give it to you personally, right in your own hand.
Thank you very much.
It's been a pleasure, ma'am, a real pleasure.
Oh, Doll.
I have a meeting with Tom. I won't be late.
James.
May I have a word with you?
Of course, darling.
That man just brought me this note.
From Aaron Burr.
Want me to read it?
I wish you would.
"Dear Dolly, I need a friend in this hour."
"You're the only one I can turn to."
"Will you... will you come to Richmond"
"if I ask you in the name of what we once meant to each other?"
"Hopefully, Aaron Burr."
Yes.
Do you think I should go?
I don't know, Doll.
Would it hurt you, politically I mean, if I did?
That wouldn't stop me if I wanted to do something.
I don't see why it should stop you.
People may talk.
That wouldn't bother either of us, would it?
It never has, James.
- No.
I don't know what to do.
His letter is so full of humility.
It's so unlike him.
This is a bitter hour for him, James.
I don't doubt it.
If they find him guilty of treason, the penalty is death.
He could've been a great man.
He had such a brilliant mind.
I wonder what led him to this folly.
Please tell me what to do.
I wish I could, but I... I can't, Doll.
This is one of those times when no one can tell you what to do but yourself.
You'll find the answer.
Your decision be my decision, no matter what happens.
Forgive me.
I'll go on to the meeting.
Miss Dolly, you still in here, sitting in the dark?
I was just gonna put this night light here.
I didn't realise it was so late, Amy.
Is there something I can do for you before you go to sleep?
Yes, pack a box for me to take in the carriage.
We're leaving for Richmond tonight.
I don't hold with us traipsing down here all alone.
You going to the jailhouse to see Mr Burr.
Never thought I'd live to see my Miss Dolly doing a thing like this.
Mr Burr once did a great favour for me.
Now it's my turn to repay him.
Anytime he crooked his little finger, you'd go along.
You was that way the day you met him.
Is it so strange that I should pity a man who's facing death?
I have to do it. If I didn't,
I'd regret it all the days in my life.
Well, I just hope it turns out all right.
You pray for me, Amy, and it will.
It's taking 'em a long time to reach a verdict.
Well, Burr's lawyers managed to throw dust in the judges eyes.
Mr Williams, you're a lawyer.
What did they mean when they said the traitor had committed no overt act?
Well, that's his defence.
Under the law, that's pretty strong.
Didn't seem very strong to me.
His counsel claims that Burr committed no act of treason and that his troops didn't fire on government troops at any time and that his campaign was against
Mexico and not against the government.
Well, everyone knows he planned to overthrow the government.
But what you know and what you can prove in a court of law... ls the trial over, sir?
- Huh?
Is the trial over?
- Oh, yes, the trial is over, but we're still waiting for the verdict of the court.
Where would I find the jailor's office, please, sir?
Right around the corner of the building. - Thank you, sir.
Now, Miss Dolly, please be careful.
Yes, Amy, I will.
I saw him when he was a senator. I heard him make a speech.
I don't care if you saw him every day in your life. I say he's guilty.
He's innocent.
- I'll bet you another dollar.
The verdict is to hang him.
It's a bet.
That's the easiest $3 I ever made.
Yes, ma'am?
Something I can do for you?
I'd like permission to see Mr Aaron Burr.
- Well, a lot of people would.
What's your name?
- Mrs James Madison.
Uh, Mrs Madison, unless I can get a pass from the court, I...
Mrs James Madison?
- Yes.
Mrs James Madison, wife of the Secretary of State?
- Yes.
Well, in that case,
I think it'll be all right.
Come right this way.
Aaron.
Dolly, you're here. I knew you'd come.
- Oh, I wish there was something I could do.
You're here, that's all that matters.
I've thought of every moment we spent together, the rides we used to take, the times we danced, and those wretched little inns you went to. - I've thought of those times, too.
And that time you came to my house in New York.
I should never have let you leave.
You did a fine thing for your country that day, Aaron.
I did that for you, Dolly. It's the only thing you ever asked of me, and I couldn't refuse.
Now you're here because you can't deny me anything.
Please understand, I came here to give you my sympathy.
Sympathy?
That's very touching, dear Dolly, but I don't need your sympathy, yours or anybody else's.
The penalty for treason is... - ...death!
I met that bony old beggar once before, and now he's missed me once again.
The verdict of the court.
"Not guilty."
I bribed the bailiff to listen to the vote.
Well, aren't you going to tell me you're happy? lam.
I hope all of this has made you think, Aaron. - It has.
I'll never make the same mistakes again.
Then I am glad.
That's why I sent for you.
Because we love each other.
And I wanted you here to see me triumphant.
Do you realise that this verdict of "not guilty" may not be popular with the people?
Popular? I should hope not.
I want them to hate me.
I want them to hate the laws that let me loose, the court that set me free.
I want to sow hate and reap a harvest of power.
But you just said that all of this had made you think.
It has.
It made me think of the power, fear and hate.
Don't you realise, Dolly, what this verdict will mean?
When they hear the news, when they hear I am free,
I'll walk out of this jail bigger than the whole government. Then you'll see their fear.
Oh, they'll try to attack me. They'll forget their famous laws and turn into a mob and be shot down by their own soldiers. And then...
Then the weak, the greedy, the suspicious, the evil men from all over the country will flock to my banner.
This time, I'll offer you the crown.
Mr Burr, better get your coat on.
The court's reconvening, and they're about ready to read the verdict.
If you please, Mrs Madison.
And this time,
Mrs Madison, I won't fail.
He very nearly was president.
He's a brand new man, but you can't skin a fox before he's caught.
They'll skin him all right at the end of a rope!
Why are they wasting time? They should a shot him the day they caught him.
This is one hanging
I'm not going to miss!
Arthur, I want you to wait here, please.
- You don't want to stay around here.
I've got to hear what happens.
Court's dismissed.
Ring the bell.
What's the verdict?
- Not guilty.
Not guilty?
Did you hear that?
Stop that bell!
Stop that bell! Stop it!
Listen to me, everybody.
In there, they just pronounced Aaron Burr innocent.
I say he's guilty!
- Yeah!
And I say Aaron Burr is a traitor! - Yeah!
The law states plain what happens to traitors.
Those judges know he's guilty.
Honest men stood up before them and told the truth about him.
I say, where's justice when such a man can get off scot-free?
If those judges are too lily-livered to hang a traitor, we can do it ourselves.
Yeah!
We can show 'em that a good hemp rope in a high oak tree is better than all them law books.
Yeah!
We'll show 'em here today what a free man thinks of traitors.
Clem, go get that rope out of my wagon. - Yes!
And if he won't come out, we'll go in and drag him out.
Yeah!
Stop it! Stop it!
What is that, ma'am?
- You must not do this, you must not.
Maam, don't you believe in justice?
Justice? Justice was never done by a mob.
Was that justice what those judges did in that court today?
Ma'am, you got a queer sense of justice.
She can tell about the traitor. Can't you, ma'am?
Tell him who you are, ma'am. Go ahead.
I'll tell him then.
This lady is Dolly Madison.
- What?
The wife of the bigwig in
Washington, James Madison.
And I charge her with bringing orders from the politicians in Washington, orders for the judges to set Aaron Burr free.
That is not true.
Well, you might have saved his life in there, ma'am, but you ain't gonna do it out here. - No!
I did not save his life.
I came to see Aaron Burr, but I brought no messages from Washington, and I have not seen the judges.
So you've just come to see Aaron Burr?
All the way from Washington!
I came to give what comfort I could to a man I thought would be condemned to death.
Well, you haven't come in vain, Mrs Madison.
Here's the kind of justice a free man has for a traitor.
We'll show those judges what we think of their laws and courts.
Stop it! Stop it!
Please listen to me.
- Go back to your husband!
If you follow that man and hang Aaron Burr, you will put an end to freedom here today.
That's where you're wrong, ma'am.
We're gonna put an end to Aaron Burr.
Yeah!
If you hang Aaron Burr in defiance of your laws, you will right here prove those laws worthless, meaningless, and you fought for blessed freedom to make those laws.
We made 'em, and we can break 'em.
You must not break them!
When you made those laws, you agreed to live by them and obey them.
If they're not strong enough to protect you, strengthen them in orderly processes, but never take them into your own hands in mobs like this.
This is not freedom.
But we're free men!
We do as we like.
Freedom is something you live under law.
Your law says a man may be tried and judged by other men like himself, according to the laws they've made together.
And if that man is found innocent by the law, he shall be held innocent by the people.
What about Burr? ls he innocent? - Yeah!
Aaron Burr has already been tried, sir.
This is your trial, your testing time, and the whole world is watching you here today.
Are you going to tell the watching world by an act of violence and disobedience to your laws that you're a people to weak to rule yourselves under law, that you need the despotic hand of a tyrant, an emperor, to rule you by force and fear?
Had Aaron Burr succeeded in his plan, he would have abolished your laws, your courts, and your rights, and you want to hang him for that, yet here you are abolishing them all yourselves.
Oh, my countrymen, Aaron Burr is but the first to challenge your freedom, he will not be the last.
Then we'll hang Aaron Burr and discourage all the rest!
That will not discourage them.
You and I must live the example of a free people.
We must prove to any man or set of men who believe themselves cunning enough to destroy our freedom that with clean hands and united hearts we are able to deal with traitors as a people under law and with order.
Here he comes now, surrounded by your soldiers.
And remember, he's a free man under your laws, and those are your soldiers under oath to protect your laws, and if you try to take Aaron Burr from them, your soldiers will be forced to fire on you.
Mr Burr wants you to do just that.
He wants you to spill your blood here.
He wants you to hate him.
He needs your hate, he needs your fear, your fear and your hate will make him strong, so that other traitors like himself will join him and again attack your freedom.
That is his plan, he told me that tonight.
Have him deny that if he can.
Come on!
If you truly want to destroy Aaron Burr, don't try to hang him, don't make a martyr of him, turn away from him!
Let him pass among you in peace!
Turn your backs on him and let him pass, on into the oblivion he has chosen for himself.
Mr Madison,
I love you very much.
[Hail to the chief plays]

Yes, sir?
Never mind, felton.
You played a great game.
Everyone's entitled to a fumble now and then.
Thank you, sir.
There you are, young man.
Thank you, sir.
All right, my dear.
Mister!
Mister!
Are you Mr. Wilson?
Yes.
Are you the president of Princeton?
Yes.
Why the heck don't you get a football team?
I've been thinking about that myself, young man.
If you know anybody who wants to swap a good halfback for a moth-eaten
Professor of economy, here's your man.

Mr. Wilson in?
Yes, sir.
Will you tell him, please, that senator
Edward Jones would like to see him?
Will you come in, please?
Thank you.
[Pianist playing the old folks at home]
Will you come into the study?
Is that him?
Yes.
What kind of a Professor is he?
Shh.
I'll tell
Mr. Wilson you're here.
Thank you.
Hmm. Not a bad layout for a schoolteacher.
The college owns it.
They just let him live here.
You know, I think it'd be kind of nice if the state did something like this for us boys.
"History of the American people,
"constitutional government...
Mere literature."
Say, did you know he wrote these himself?
Good evening, gentlemen.
Good evening, Professor.
I am senator Jones.
Big ed?
[Laughing]
That's right.
This is my nephew
Jim beeker.
How do you do, sir?
My old friend ed Sullivan.
Professor Wilson.
Mr. Sullivan.
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Excuse me, senator.
I'll take your coat.
Yes. Thanks.
Well, senator, what can I do for you?
Mr. Wilson, how would you like to be governor of new Jersey?
Governor?
There's a strong progressive movement running in this country.
People are looking for a change.
Yes, but why me?
I'm not a politician.
No, but your fight to abolish these social clubs and run Princeton on an equal footing for everybody has a lot of people talking.
I was under the impression
I'd been defeated in that fight.
[Senator]
Oh, people don't take those schoolboy matters as seriously as you do,
Professor.
All they can see is that you're against special privilege.
That's enough for them.
Besides, your books on how to run a government are known all over the world.
Oh, you read my books,
Mr. Sullivan?
Well, I, uh...
Let's say we've heard them spoken of very highly.
Of course, gentlemen, this is all very flattering, but to be perfectly Frank with you, senator, you're barking up the wrong tree.
I'm a schoolteacher, which must make me something of an idiot in the eyes of a lot of good people.
Ha ha.
Ha ha.
It's even worse.
I'm a Southern democrat in a yankee stronghold.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
We just won't tell anybody about that,
Professor.
Besides, you must realize this isn't the sort of decision
I can make overnight.
Take your time,
Professor.
There's no hurry.
Convention's still a long way off.
We won't take any more of your time.
We know how busy you are.
Here you are, sir.
Thank you, Sullivan.
I'm going to say it.
I'd be afraid...
Mr. Wilson,
I have a feeling that this casual meeting will be the beginning of a delightful association for all of us.
Indeed, it is the beginning of a new era in the state of new Jersey, one upon which we will all look back with everlasting pride.
Good night, sir.
Good night, senator.
And you will think it over,
Professor?
I'll do better than that, senator.
I'll have my wife think it over.
Good night.
Good night, Mr. Wilson.
Was that really big ed himself?
In person.
What did he want?
Oh, nothing of any importance.
He... he merely wants me to run for governor.
Governor?
Jerusalem!
You governor?
And why not?
What did you tell him?
Oh, that
I'd think it over and, of course, ask your permission.
Woodrow, you didn't.
Have I ever done anything foolish without asking your permission?
Woodrow,
I know you haven't any personal ambition just to hold office, but you must admit the opportunity is rather unusual.
So it is.
So it is.
You must get awfully tired sometimes of a mere talking profession.
You're quite right, my dear.
I will admit there are moments when the academic life has its drawbacks, but the idea of a man my age suddenly giving up a nice, comfortable way of life and launching out on a sea of ifs and buts sounds like the account of a fool.
But you've always been interested in politics.
Only as an observer on the sidelines, my dear.
How about the time you were a student at the university of Virginia and wrote your father that you'd decided to be a senator?
And had cards printed...
"senator Thomas woodrow Wilson."
A youthful indiscretion.
I was young then, young lady.
Very young.
About your mental age.
Besides, you know perfectly well
I have certain responsibilities to Princeton.
You know your work at Princeton is done.
You believe in the principles of Democratic equality, the abolition of any special privileged class.
If these things are worthwhile, don't they apply to all the people, not just to Princeton?
You mean you really think
I should seriously consider it?
Oh, I do, woodrow.
I most assuredly do.
We all do, father.
We all do.
You'd make a beautiful governor.
Of course.
I declare,
I never met such a collection of ambitious women in my life.
If I do go into this...
And mind you,
I'm not saying I will...
I warn you and you and you and you, you'll have to kiss all the babies.
That's one thing
I draw the line on.
[Laughter]
How about a locomotive?
You ready?
Hip! Hip!
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Sis sis sis!
Boom boom boom ba!
Princeton!
Princeton!
Princeton!
Yay!
Yay!
Do you really think they'll like him?
Mother, stop worrying.
They'll love him.
But he's never had any experience with people like these before.
Neither have they had any experience with a man like father before.
[Band stops playing]
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm going to let you in on a little secret.
Many of my friends are very much worried about this campaign.
They tell me
I'm conducting it in the worst possible way because, it appears,
I'm asking you people to think.
[Crowd laughs]
On the other hand, my opponents are even more worried because they expected my speeches to be mere academic lectures on government filled with glittering generalities that have nothing to do with the situation in new Jersey.
Apparently, they've deluded themselves into thinking that I have no political experience.
Good heavens.
No political experience?
I wonder if these gentlemen have ever attended a faculty meeting or seen the wives of the trustees in action.
[Laughing]
That's all very amusing,
Mr. Wilson.
But why don't you tell us what kind of deal you've made with the bosses?
Sit down!
Sit down!
I've made no deal with anyone.
I suppose you're going to deny that there's even such a thing as a boss system in new Jersey!
No. The existence of the boss system is notorious.
Then what are you going to do about it?
Bend all my energies to breaking it up!
[Cheering and applause]
When you say bosses, do you mean big ed Jones,
Jim beeker, and ed Sullivan?
Who's that?
Joe tumulty, one of them Irish lawyers in the legislature.
Claims to be a democrat, but he ain't voted right once.
Come on!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Keep quiet, you hear?
[Woman]
Aah!
Quiet!
Everybody, quiet!
All right.
Go ahead.
Thank you, judge.
Of course
I mean big ed.
I feel about him exactly as I feel about every other boss, whether he's a democrat or a republican.
Yay!
Yay!
Senator Jones understands exactly how I feel.
In fact, just so there would be no misunderstanding about it, he has given me his word that in no circumstances would he permit his name to be presented to the legislature as a candidate for re-election to the United States senate, an office for which
I consider him utterly unfitted.
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!
What do you say, big ed?
Heh heh heh heh.
I say the candidate speaks for the party.
Yay!
Yay!
[Band plays]
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Sis sis sis!
Boom boom boom ba!
Princeton!
Princeton!
Princeton!
Yay!
Yay!
Mother!
Suppose somebody sees you.
Let them!
Great, great. He'll win.
Yeah? Suppose he means it?
Nonsense. They had him in a corner.
What else could he say?
Just the same,
I don't like the cut of that fellow's jaw.
I tell you, he's something new in politics...
A scholar and a gentleman with ideals and principles.
You can't beat that when it comes to electioneering.
Wasn't he wonderful?
The most idiotic campaign speech in the whole history of politics.
I don't understand.
He means what he says.
Gentlemen!
Your attention, please!
9:18 P.M.
Returns from
22 counties.
Wilson leading by 40,000.
Majority!
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!
Good work, boys.
I'm proud of you.
* for he's a jolly good fellow *
* for he's a jolly good fellow *
* for he's a jolly good fellow *
* which nobody can deny nice smile now.
Get closer.
Mr. Wilson, will you step on the other side?
All of you, look this way, please.
Where do you expect to live, Mrs. Wilson?
We haven't made our plans yet.
What will you girls wear to the inauguration?
We haven't decided.
What jewelry will you wear?
None.
That's right.
The Wilson girls don't believe in jewelry.
We do. We just haven't any.
If you'll step over here...
What's your first move, governor?
Have you made any appointments?
Gentlemen, if you'll wait a minute,
I'll be glad to write out a statement.
Just give us some personal stuff.
Quite an upset,
Professor.
Any election's an upset, young man, if you're unfortunate enough to be elected.
Lean closer to Mrs. Wilson, governor.
I have to put up with this in my home?
Every day until the end of your life.
You might as well get used to it.
Smile.
Hold still!
The legislature has had sufficient time to digest the contents of this bill, gentlemen.
Therefore, I must insist that it be brought to a vote immediately regardless of the opposition.
You're right.
We have the votes.
Let's go ahead and let them howl.
Excuse me.
Yes, tumulty?
Senator Jones has arrived...
With Mr. beeker.
Thank you, tumulty.
Send them in, please.
Will you gentlemen excuse me?
Surely, governor.
Good morning, governor.
Good morning, senator.
Mr. beeker.
Sit down, gentlemen.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Well, you sent for me, governor?
Yes.
Did you authorize this statement to the effect that you have decided to be a candidate for the
United States senate?
At the insistence of many of my friends, governor.
But you publicly stated that in no circumstances would you be a candidate.
A man says a lot of things in the heat of a campaign.
To go back on your word so soon after the election would be outrageous and indecent.
Oh, come, come, come, governor.
People don't take these matters as seriously as you do.
They've probably forgotten all about it.
I beg to differ with you, senator.
I haven't forgotten, nor have the people.
Surely if the party feels
Uncle Ed's their man...
Those who elected me have already decided he's not.
Hold on, governor.
Let's get one thing clear.
I nominated you.
I elected you.
Then you should've exercised better judgment in your choice.
Would you be satisfied to announce your opposition publicly and let it go at that?
If you insist on going through with such bald-faced deceit,
I shall have no recourse but to fight you with every means in my power.
Well, looks to me as if the Professor will give us the bum's rush and run this whole show himself.
I consider your language coarse and your manners offensive.
However, you seem to have grasped the idea perfectly.
I don't want to quarrel with you, governor.
I know how seriously you take all these reform issues and how hard you've worked.
What you need is a nice, long rest.
Good day, senator.
Be sensible, governor.
We know you're aiming for the white house.
What chance would you have for the nomination if your state organization's against you?
Get out.
You're no gentleman.
You're no judge.
I still don't understand it.
He seemed like such a nice fellow, too.
I told you
I didn't like the cut of that fellow's jaw.
What gets me is the way the newspapers around the country are picking this up, making him a hero.
Be just like that darn convention to nominate him for president now, whether we like it or not.
The Republicans split wide-open between
Teddy Roosevelt and taft, they can elect him, too.
Well, if you ask me, that would be a whole lot better than having him hanging around new Jersey.
Yes, I'll tell governor Wilson you called the moment he returns.
[Knock on door]
Come in.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Yes, thank you, sir.
Hello, boys.
Hello, tumulty.
What's that?
More applications for the Wilson for president clubs.
There's Rochester and Atlanta and oyster bay.
What?
That's Teddy Roosevelt's hometown.
Well, uh, I come from there too, Mr. tumulty.
[Ring]
Governor Wilson's office.
This is his secretary.
Oh, yes, congressman.
How do you do? Sorry.
The governor's out of town at the moment on an important mission.
I wish I could tell you where he is, but it's something very close to his heart, something I'm sure you'd approve of.
[Orchestra plays moonlight bay]
* we were sailing along
* on moonlight bay
* we could hear the voices singing *
* they seemed to say
* you have stolen her heart *
* now, don't go away
* as we sang those old sweet songs *
* on moonlight bay
Henry.
Mr. Holmes.
A very important mission, hmm?
Official business, no doubt.
Yes, it's odd, but it seems something important like this comes up at least once a week.
Yes. Every time the palace changes its program.
You've taken to politics like a Billy goat to tin cans, raising Cain all over the place.
No wonder they want to kick you upstairs into the white house.
Don't take these
Wilson for president clubs too seriously.
Remember, a lot of people still regard me as a pretty dangerous fellow.
So you are, but it's too late.
I've already paid $5.00 to help bamboozle the public.
Just throwing it away.
Maybe, but Teddy Roosevelt's a Harvard man.
Bill taft's from Yale.
I'd give $5.00 of my money any day to let a Princeton boy have a crack at them in the same game.
Bully! Bully!
I'm de-lighted.
[Band plays dixie]
[Gavel pounds]
Quiet!
Order!
The delegates...
Will resume...
Their seats.
And the sergeant at arms will clear the aisle.
The chair has the honor...
To present to you...
That great democrat...
That fearless leader...
Who has never...
Sold the truth to serve the hour.
The great commoner himself...
Nebraska's favorite son...
William Jennings Bryan.
[Band plays onward Christian soldiers]
Mcadoo!
Mcadoo.
What is it,
Daniels?
Wilson's at the governor's mansion in sea girt.
Get him on the telephone.
I don't like the way this
Bryan thing is going.
Neither do I, but mccombs, his campaign manager, isn't worried.
It's too early.
Besides, every newspaper in New York has a direct wire to the governor's place.
He probably already knows what's going on.
[Typewriter]
That William
Jennings Bryan.
He's trying to steal the nomination for himself.
What's he done now, tumulty?
He's got his band playing hymns.
It is my great honor...
And distinguished privilege to place in nomination for the exalted office of president of the United States...
That great statesman from Alabama...
Oscar w. Underwood.
Yay! Yay!
Yay! Yay!
* I came from Alabama
* with a banjo on my knee
* I'm going to Louisiana
* my true love for to see... *
* I thought I saw susannah comin' down the hill *
* oh, susannah
* oh, don't you cry for me *
* I came from Alabama
* with a banjo on my knee *
* I came from Alabama.
I give you that great statesman from Missouri...
A great servant...
Of the common man...
The honorable champ Clark.
Yay! Yay!
Yay! Yay!
New Jersey appreciates the honor of placing...
Before this convention...
As a candidate...
For the presidency...
Of the United States...
The seer and philosopher...
Of Princeton...
The Princeton schoolmaster...
Woodrow Wilson.
[Band plays school days]
Governor!
Governor!
Here's the result of the first ballot...
Clark... 440,
Wilson... 324,
Underwood... 117.
Huh! Sounds like our golf score.
Thank you, tumulty.
Those reporters have been after me all morning.
Won't you say something?
Yes.
You may tell them that governor Wilson received the news of the first ballot in a riot of silence.
Fore!
Good-o.
The chair recognizes the leader of the New York delegation...
The honorable
Charles Murphy of tammany hall.
New York...
Wishes at this time...
To change its ballot and cast its 90 votes for the next president of the United States...
Champ Clark of Missouri.
Yay! Yay!
Yay! Yay!
Hello, Daniels.
Hello. Hello.
If they don't stop that fool song soon,
I'll get a real hound out there and kick him around.
You can't do that, josephus.
They'd lynch you, and we need every
Wilson vote we can get.
Yes?
What?
Oh.
Just a minute.
William mccombs, governor.
He wants to speak to you personally.
Hello, mccombs. I...
The jig's up, governor.
It looks like a stampede for Clark.
This last parade's gone on over an hour.
You've got to send me a wire withdrawing your name.
I can't hold your delegates any longer.
What's the score now?
Clark... 556,
Wilson... 350 1/2.
It's hopeless.
No candidate yet has ever received a majority without being nominated.
We should have made some kind of deal with that New York delegation.
What's Bryan going to do?
He's been hoping he could play you and Clark off against each other, then get the nomination himself, but it's too late.
We're licked.
It'll be Clark on the next ballot.
Just a minute.
Mccombs sounds pretty excited.
Thinks I should send a telegram releasing my delegates.
I knew it all along...
That tammany hall.
Now I know why the Democratic party picked a jackass for a mascot.
It's all right, woodrow.
At least we'll be able to get away for a holiday.
Thank you, my dear.
Hello, mccombs...
Hello?
Let me have that phone!
Governor.
Hello, governor.
William g. Mcadoo speaking.
I just heard what mccombs told you, but he's dead wrong.
You can't withdraw now.
Clark will never get a 2/3 vote.
Wait. If you don't believe me, here's josephus Daniels.
He'll tell you the same thing.
Hello. He's right, governor.
Mcadoo is right.
You're stronger than ever.
Your delegates will stick if it takes all summer.
Just a minute.
That's odd.
My convention manager tells me we're defeated.
Mcadoo and Daniels say I can't lose.
What do you think?
Stay in, by all means.
Certainly, governor.
What do you think,
Eleanor?
That you've nothing to lose by staying in.
That's what I think.
We'll stay in.
Hello, mcadoo.
Thank my friends.
Tell them we'll see it through.
The delegates will resume their seats...
And the sergeant at arms, clear the aisles!
Mr. chairman...
For what purpose does the gentleman from Nebraska arise?
To explain my vote!
Speaking for myself and for any of the delegation who may decide to join me,
I shall withhold my vote from champ Clark.
No! Boo!
Boo! No!
So long as New York's vote is recorded for him.
I...
Cast it for...
Nebraska's second choice...
Woodrow Wilson!
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!
[Band plays school days]
The next president of the United States!
The next president!

Governor!
We're in! We're in!
We're in, governor!
You've been nominated on the 46th ballot!
Oh, papa! Oh, daddy!
Congratulations, governor.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
[Playing hail to the chief]
They're playing hail to the chief.
Congratulations, governor.
Is this your work?
I've had them waiting two days.
What if I hadn't been nominated?
I made arrangements with them to fold up their tents like the arabs and silently steal away.
When I speak to you of business and government, of capital and labor, of privilege and equal opportunities, my only purpose...
Is to rehabilitate democracy and to prove to the world that the Democratic system can successfully meet the economic, industrial, and social problems that confront us.
Because I believe, as Lincoln did, that democracy...
With all its faults and failures, if properly guided and interpreted, holds the future of the world.
My great dream is...
That as the years go on, the world will turn to America more and more for those moral inspirations which lie at the basis of all freedom.
And that America...
Will come into the full light of the day when all the world shall know she puts human rights above all other rights and that her flag...
Is not only the flag of America, but the flag of humanity.
Yay! Yay!
Yay! Yay!
I thought you'd like to hear these.
"I cordially congratulate you on your election
"and extend to you my best wishes
"for a successful administration.
William Howard taft."
"The American people, by a great plurality,
"have conferred upon you the highest honor
"in their gift.
"I congratulate you thereon.
Theodore Roosevelt."
President of the United States.

Only a sense of solemn responsibility.

Only too well...
The very great task ahead of me.
And I look pleadingly to you, the young men of America...
To stand behind me...
To support me.
That's all I can say...

Mr. president,
I'm hoover, the chief Usher.
How do you do?
This is Mrs. Wilson.
How do you do,
Mr. hoover?
My daughters...
Miss jessie, miss Margaret, miss Ellen.
Perhaps you and Mrs. Wilson might like to inspect your living quarters before lunch.
Thank you. I would.
This way, please.
We'll take the elevator up.
It's this way, sir.
Big, isn't it?
[Laughter]
Who's this?
That's
Mrs. John Tyler.
Oh, yes.
Look, father, here's a picture of president taft.
Yes. Very good, too.
Oh, mother, it's lovely!
I thought it was going to be overpowering, and it's not at all.
It's just a home.
Does it amaze you that our predecessors had good taste?
Come see my room.
I'm sure it's where
Abigail Adams hung out her laundry.
That was the east room.
I looked it up.
Look!
Mistress Dolly Madison.
Don't anyone dare tell me she didn't sleep here.
Can't you almost feel them?
Heavens, you don't think the house is haunted?
A lot of them were extremely reluctant to leave here during their lifetime.
"Of January 1st, 1863,
"whereby four million slaves were given their freedom
"and slavery forever prohibited in the United States."
Imagine, and in my room.
Miss Nell, guess what.
They've got three automobiles here and an electric, and the chauffeur said we could use them whenever we wanted.
Not bad for a family that never even owned a horse and buggy.
Oh, I wish we would have an inaugural ball tonight.
It'd be such fun.
Father hates a lot of fuss.
I know, but tonight,
I wish he was a republican.
Shh!
President Lincoln's bed.
He must've been an awfully big man.
He was.
My dears, your father and I have a gift for each of you in commemoration of this day.
Oh, mother!
How sweet!
Oh, mother.
Oh, it's exquisite.
It's the most beautiful ring
I've ever seen.
Oh, a bracelet watch.
Mother, it's just what I've always wanted.
Ohh...
Oh, look.
Mother.
Diamond pendant.
Oh, it's too beautiful.
But why did you...
I mean, how did you...
I borrowed money from the bank to pay my campaign expenses, and this was left over.
Oh, woodrow, it's too nice.
Perhaps, but I've got a better job now...
Shorter hours, more pay.
[Knock on door]
Come in.
Excuse me,
Mr. president, but luncheon is served.
Oh, thank you...
Simms, sir.
Thank you, Simms.
Howdy, miss Ellen.
You don't remember me, do you?
Why, no, I...
My family lived right behind yours in Rome, Georgia.
My mother did your mother's washing for close on to 30 years, I reckon.
How nice to have someone from down home.
Yes, indeed, miss Ellen, it's going to be mighty nice for me, too, having ladies and gentlemen around that speak my language.
[Giggling]
I don't know what I came for.
He didn't want my advice.
Once he's made up his mind, nothing in heaven will change it.
Bye, Joe.
Goodbye, senator.
At least he listened to our side of it.
He was polite, but somehow he makes me feel like an unruly schoolboy.
I catch myself being afraid he's going to rap me over the knuckles.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Senator lodge.
Morning, senator.
Didn't expect to find you here.
Oh, yes. We Republicans still do business with the government...
Occasionally.
[Laughter]
Good morning, senator lodge.
Tumulty.
Will you announce me to the president?
Yes, of course, senator.
Won't you sit down, sir?
Thank you.
Awfully glad to see you back, colonel.
Glad to be back, thank you.
Colonel house.
Hello, tumulty.
Welcome home.
Come in.
The governor's waiting to see you.
Senator.
Colonel house.
Go right in, sir.
Oh, thank you.
I'm sorry, senator.
Colonel house just got back from Europe.
The president's anxious to see him.
You don't mind waiting, do you?
Not at all.
House.
Governor.
Welcome home.
Thank you.
My, I'm glad you're back.
Have you seen the morning paper, senator?
Yes.
* by the light
* by the light, by the light *
* of the silvery moon
* the silver moon
* I want to spoon

Ellen, come and help us out.
Oh, I can't.
I promised Helen we'd finish this list tonight.
Helen, I told you what you were getting into when you took this job as
Ellen's secretary.
Yes, cousin woodrow, but you didn't say what a white house wedding's like.
It's all jessie's fault.
If she hadn't decided to get married...
Well, I like that.
What about your own wedding?
That's different.
Mac lives here in Washington, but you have to marry someone that lives at the other end of nowhere.
Well, Helen, if these people are going to be blue,
I'd better join them.
Goodness only knows why they need my voice.
They know I never could sing a note.

Are you ill?
I don't know.
I'm all right.
Come and sit down.
I'm just a little faint.
Get some water.
Mother, what is it?
I'm just a little dizzy, that's all.
You've been doing too much.
It's all this entertaining.
You can't keep it up.
Well, that's my job.
The president has to entertain.
Not if it's going to affect your health.
You'd better lie down.
Nonsense.
I feel perfectly all right.
I'll just sit here while you go on with your song.
Not tonight.
Please.
I insist.
It'll sound much better without me.
Please. Go on.
[Piano plays]

I wish you girls didn't feel you had to sit here with me.
Oh, mother, we like it here.
Your poor father.
He's hardly been out of that chair for a week.
Where's father now?
I made him lie down.
He looked so tired.
Besides, I wanted to speak to you girls alone.
Of course, I'm sure
I'm going to be all right, but if anything should happen to me,
I want you girls to promise me one thing.
Mother, don't even say such things.
Your father is a great man.
Promise me you won't let him be a lonely great man.
Mother.
Please.
More than anyone
I've ever known, he needs sympathy and loyalty, companionship.
He needs a woman's love and attention and understanding...
Someone he can turn to and trust.
A wife is as much a part of him as his very mind or heart.
I know... Because
I've been his wife.
Promise?
Of course we promise.
But, mother, it's ridiculous of you to talk like this.
You'll be up and about in no time.
You know it.
I'm sorry, Mr. president.
Excuse me, governor.
Senator Carter glass telephoned.
He wants to know, can he see you this afternoon about that federal reserve bank matter?
He'll have to excuse me.
I can think of nothing while
Ellen's like this.
All right, governor.
He'll understand.
Father, you promised mother you'd play golf this afternoon.
I know.
But I can't.
I can't bear the thought of her suffering.
Father, she wouldn't want you to feel like this.
She's always been the most radiant person I've known.
For 30 years,
I've never had a thought in which she didn't enter.
I can't...
I couldn't go on without her.
I'll never forget the first time
I ever saw her.
I was practicing law in Atlanta.
I had to go to Rome,
Georgia, on business.
Her father was the presbyterian minister.
I went to his church.
I'm afraid I couldn't have told you what the sermon was about.
She saw you, too.
She always said she was glad she had on her prettiest hat.
I don't think any two people were ever so happy.
When I was teaching at bryn mawr and at Princeton when you girls were babies...
It's this place that's killing her.
She's been happy here, father, and so proud of you.
No. She's done too much.
I didn't realize it.
She wouldn't have been happy doing any less.
Well, Grayson?
She's sleeping now.
So far as I can tell, there's been no great change since yesterday, just a gradual weakening.
There's no hope?
Medical science is not the last word,
Mr. president.
We can only wait and see.
[Singing hymn]
[Explosions and gunfire]
[Piano plays]
If there were only something we could do, some way we could help.
It's difficult.
Extra! Extra!
Lusitania torpedoed off coast of Ireland.
Over 100 American lives lost.
Extra! Extra!
Dirty huns!
Ought to be wiped out, the lot of them.
German sub sinks lusitania.
Over 1,500 die.
Lusitania torpedoed by German sub.
It's cold-blooded murder.
Wholesale slaughter.
[Ding ding]
We'll be at war with Germany in a week.
It's not our war.
Why should we get involved?
If Americans don't want to get hurt, let them stay home.
I bet Teddy Roosevelt would know what to do.
Over 100 American citizens murdered on the high seas, and that man in the white house too proud to fight.
But we have no choice.
These huns must be taught a lesson.
We can't watch the world slipping into anarchy.
We've got to declare war.
No, no, no!
Our people were warned to stay off that ship.
How do we know that it wasn't carrying munitions?
Nonsense. That's nothing but German propaganda.
Congress is all set to act.
It'll back us up.
What about the people?
Don't worry.
They're good and mad.
Read your newspapers.
Mr. president, do you know people are saying openly that this administration lacks courage?
They may call me a coward or anything else, but I won't be rushed into this war.
You'll overlook the most dastardly crime of which any civilized nation has ever been guilty?
No. I shall warn the German government in the strongest terms that in future it will be held to strict accountability.
Another note?
Yes. Another note.
These Germans pay no attention to notes.
The only thing they understand is force.
I'm not so much concerned with what the Germans do as I am with our own responsibility, which is to keep out of this war if possible, so that at the right time, we can offer ourselves as the only nation in the world with sufficient strength and influence to bring about a decent and lasting peace.
The vast majority of Americans expect me to keep my head and save them from this awful mess.
I don't want them to say when the casualty lists come in,
"why did Wilson have to move so fast?
Why didn't he make one more effort?"
Have you considered what this policy of uncertainty is doing to our economy?
Cotton down to 6 cents, our goods rotting on the docks, afraid to put to sea, our farmers and railroads facing ruin.
I haven't thought to consider this war in terms of dollars and cents.
Nor have the fathers and mothers of this country.
No, gentlemen.
It would be the easiest thing in the world for me as president to ask for a declaration of war.
The man on horseback is always a hero.
But I wouldn't have to do the fighting.
Some poor farmer's boy or the son of some great family would have to do the fighting and the dying.
When I ask them to do that,
I want to be very sure that what they're dying for is worthwhile.
Good morning.
[Typing]
Oh, thank you, my dear.
You really should be in bed, father.
It's very late.
Yes.
I'll go along directly.
It would be nice if we could run away from it all.
You know, once upon a time, your mother and I did just that.
I'd been working very hard on the first draft of mere literature.
Without telling anyone at the university, we slipped out for a holiday in the country...
And it was just about the most perfect two weeks
I've ever known.
We tramped in the hills, slept in the sun, and walked alone at night under the stars.
Your mother was a very wonderful woman,
Margaret.
She had that rare quality of always being close to you when you wanted her, when you needed her.
[Typing]
Extra! Extra!
Read all about it!
Germany agrees to quit submarine warfare!
Read all about it!
Germany agrees to quit submarine warfare!
Extra! Extra! Germany agrees to quit submarine warfare!
How long will Germany live up to it?
As long as it suits her convenience.
I suppose we'll have to go along with Wilson's preparedness program.
Not his preparedness program... ours.
We started it.
We pushed it when he would have nothing to do with it.
Now he's claiming it for himself because he thinks it's good politics.
Never mind that.
It has to be done.
Not only will we have to go along, but we'll have to lead the way, put aside any thought of party and do what we can to save this country.
Well, Mr. president,
Teddy Roosevelt can't say that you haven't adopted at least one of his policies.
Thank you, Joe.
What's that?
The strenuous life.
Oh, it's the president.
And looking the worse for wear, I'm afraid.
Hello, cousin woodrow.
Come in. Come in.
Cousin woodrow,
I want you to know my friend Mrs. galt.
I'm delighted,
Mrs. galt.
Mr. president.
You know Dr. Grayson.
Very well, for a long time.
Have you forgotten?
I introduced you to Edith.
Oh, yes.
Yes, of course.
We've been for a walk in the rain.
Edith came here for tea with Margaret and me.
Tea? Sounds delicious.
May we come, too?
Shall we let them?
As patriotic citizens,
I don't see how we can very well say no.
You're from the South,
Mrs. galt?
Yes. I have the honor to be born in the same state as you... Virginia.
She's a descendant of pocahontas.
Well, that is Virginia.
We shan't keep you waiting long.
Oh, don't hurry. Give us time to freshen up a bit.
Excuse me.
Charming woman.
Very.
Do you play golf,
Mrs. galt?
Oh, yes, Mr. president.
And this will give you an idea how well.
The last time, I was
200 yards from the green.
I asked my caddie if he thought
I could make it with my mashie, and he replied,
"yes, ma'am, you can make it, allowing you hits it often enough."
We're going down the potomac next weekend on the yacht.
Would you care to join us?
Oh, I'd love to, but I promised to visit the Hastings in Virginia.
That's a shame. I'd hoped you could come.
Cousin woodrow will be terribly disappointed.
The president asked for me?
"You're the only woman I know
"who can wear an orchid.
Generally, it's the orchid that wears the woman."
I think this is my favorite spot at the white house.
It is lovely.
I asked Margaret and the others to leave us alone for a while that I might have an opportunity to say something to you.
Yes?
I need you, Edith.
Will you be my wife?
Mr. president.
I know this comes as a shock to you.
Perhaps I've been too impulsive, but if I'm to continue to make opportunities to see you,
I must speak.
But how can you be sure?
You've only known me a few months.
Time isn't always measured in weeks or months.
In the past year,
I've lived a lifetime of loneliness and heartache.
You've changed all that, given me hope that happiness is still possible.
Have you spoken to your daughters?
Yes.
They tell me they already love and admire you and that nothing would make them happier.
But I've never thought of you except as the president.
And, besides,
I've had no training that would befit me for the responsibilities of such a life.
Would you rather
I had not spoken?
Oh, no.
There isn't any woman who wouldn't be touched to be told that she could be of help to a man in your position in times like these...
But I'd have to have time to know you and to see you and to be with you.
Do you want to see me?
Yes, I do.
Then I'll wait...
And in all fairness to you, there's something you should understand.
There's a spotlight on this house.
Everyone who comes here is observed and discussed.
Everything I say is quoted...
Sometimes even correctly.
No matter how I try,
I can't protect you from gossip.
I'm not afraid of gossip.
It would be even worse if I came to your house.
But surely you have the right to choose your own friends.
In this job, I'm not sure
I have any rights at all.
This gossip you speak of, would it hurt you, what you're doing?
It's you I'm thinking of.
Well, then, I suggest we go on exactly as we have in the past...
But as to being your wife, if I have to say yes or no now, then I'm afraid the answer must be no.
Won't you at least give me the hope that you might change your mind...
That maybe when you know me better...
I'd be less than a woman,
Mr. president, if I didn't reserve that right.
[Take me out to the ballgame plays]
Mr. president.
Yay!
Yay!
That's her.
Yes. An election coming up, too.
There's no use beating about the bush, Edith.
You know about the whispers, the gossip that's going on.
He heard about it today.
Naturally, he would be the last to hear.
I've never seen him so angry in my life.
His lips went white.
His hands shook.
I think if he could get his hands on those scandalmongers, he'd forget he's president.
Oh, no, he mustn't do that.
What's worse, some of his own friends are mixed up in it.
They're afraid that a second marriage will prevent his re-election.
What do you think?
That his own political fortunes don't make any difference to him.
It's you.
Nothing must stand in the way of his re-election.
I'd never forgive myself if I were the cause of his defeat.
Edith, he's the president of the United States, but first of all, he's a man, and he loves you.
To do what he has to do, he... he needs you.
Thank you, Dr. Grayson.
It was very kind of you to tell me all this.
I'll write him my decision.
Thanks, Edith.
[Typing]
Hello, Joe, what's the news?
Not a thing.
How's with you?
Oh, all right.
Mm-hmm.
No notes to Germany?
Nope.
No sinkings?
No.
No messages to congress about us being too proud to fight?
Sorry. Just the usual routine.
Jumping Jupiter!
What? What is it?
What's the matter?
The story. The list.
The announcement has just been made of the engagement of Mrs. Norman galt of Washington, D.C.
And woodrow Wilson, president of the United States.
[Hail to the chief plays]
[Applause]
His imperious majesty appears to be in good spirits tonight.
Time will remedy that.
Do you really think we have a chance to defeat him in November?
Not defeat, senator, obliterate.
You can't enjoy the convention without a hot dog!
Buy it hot! Buy it now!
* we take out hats off to you,
Mr. Wilson *
* our hats are off to you
* you're the man of the hour *
* you stood like a tower
* and no one could do for the red, white, and blue *
* you're the right kind of man *
* in the right kind of place *
* like Washington and Lincoln *
* you set the pace
* we know at home and abroad *
* your pen is greater than the sword *
* we take our hats off to you *
* I didn't raise my boy to be a soldier *
* I brought him up to be my pride and joy *
* who dares to place a musket *
* on his shoulder
* to shoot some other mother's darling boy? *
* he's got those big blue eyes like you, daddy *
* reminds me of you all the time *
* when he grows to be a man *
* I'll give him up to Uncle Sam *
* just like I did with you
* daddy mine we must rid ourselves of this college sissy and once again substitute action for elocution!
He kept us out of war!
Woodrow Wilson is the most incompetent...
Vacillating...
Insincere...
And cowardly leader this nation has ever endured!
He kept us out of war!
Wilson and his dynasty, his heirs and assigns, anybody who with bended knee has served his purposes, must be driven from all control, from all influence upon the government of the United States!
While we watch a world in flames, we must not forget what is happening here at home under our very noses.
Private initiative is being stifled, business is being put into a straitjacket, all under this false claim that this is democracy.
When, as a matter of fact, it is nothing but the blundering of a starry-eyed idealist.
Re-elect woodrow Wilson!
He kept us out of war!
[Playing dixie]
"A weak and imbecile man,"
"the weakest I ever knew in a high place."
"If I wanted to paint a despot,
"a man perfectly regardless
"of every constitutional right of the people,
I would paint his hideous form."
That's outrageous!
"When he goes out of office next march,
"the whole country except thieves, cowards,
"public plunderers, officeholders, and traitors will rejoice."
Woodrow, that's the last straw.
You've got to do something about it.
They've no right to say such things about you even to win an election.
They weren't talking about me.
That's what they said about Abraham Lincoln when he was running for re-election in 1864.
[Laughter]
I understand
Teddy Roosevelt says you're the most incompetent man to ever occupy the office, worse even than
Thomas Jefferson.
[Laughter]
Frankly, I've been much more concerned with what our own side's been saying.
All this prating about "he kept us out of war," as if I can see what is or is not to be.
Any little German lieutenant can put us into the war tomorrow by some new outrage on the sea tonight.
Would you mind very much if you should be defeated?
I don't suppose any man wants to see his policies repudiated.
I heard that betting in wall street closed at 10-8 against you, father.
I hope you didn't take any of it.
Governor.
Yes, tumulty?
Governor, the New York times has just conceded the election to Mr. Hughes.
Why, it's only 9:00.
How can they be sure?
They're still at the polls in the west.
Yes...
It does seem a bit early.
Coffee, tumulty?
Thank you, governor.
However, the times is generally right.
In the meanwhile,
I see no reason to despair.
The government's not going to collapse just because I've been left at home.
Hughes is an honest man and a very capable one.
As a matter of fact, his own party referred to him as Wilson-with-whiskers.
With whiskers.
Of course, my wife may feel the country's judgment's a bit warped.
I can only think that you'll be free from all this worry.
Waiting for election returns is like a hen sitting on a nest, except that the hen uses better judgment than a politician...
She never cackles until after she's laid the egg.
[Laughter]
May we talk to Mr. Hughes?
The president has gone to bed.
He has left word that he was not to be disturbed.
Well, when the president wakes up, give him this and tell him you're not so sure he's president after all.
Thank you.
Well, Mr. president, we can do this all over again.
Another four years.
Yes, another four years.
Congratulations,
Mr. president, and the public's to be congratulated, too...
For their good judgment.
Thank you.
I never gave up for one minute.
I did. I'd have sold out pretty cheaply election night.
You just got by in the electoral college, but you polled three million more popular votes than in 1912, and that's not to be laughed at.
Why on earth any man should want a job like this for another four years is beyond me.
[Laughter]
But I confess,
I did want it.
Mr. president.
Baker.
Mr. secretary.
Has the president retired?
Yes, sir.
Wake him.
Tell him Mr. Lansing, secretary of state, his excellency count Von bernstorff, the German ambassador, are here, and that we must see him at once.
Will you wait in the east room, sir?
Thank you.
Mr. president.
Mr. Lansing.
Your excellency.
What is it, gentlemen?
I'm sorry to disturb you at such an hour, but count Von bernstorff has just handed me another note from his government.
Beginning tomorrow,
Germany will resume its policy of unrestricted submarine warfare.
We have no other choice.
And will sink on sight and without warning any neutral vessel entering European waters.
With certain exceptions, of course.
One American ship will be permitted to leave a designated port each week, provided it is properly lighted and marked.
We deeply regret the necessity of this decision.
We sincerely hope it will not interfere with your noble efforts to bring about peace with our enemies.
Sit down, sir.
We also have received indisputable proof within the last hour that the German government has been using our own state department cables to foment trouble between this country and Mexico.
What?
With California, new Mexico, and parts of Texas as bait.
I deny any such thing.
The proof is overwhelming,
Mr. president.
There can be no doubt.
Count Von bernstorff...
For more than two years, this government has exercised every restraint in its efforts to remain neutral in this conflict, but you and your military masters apparently are determined to deny us that right.
But I assure you...
Every way we turn, we run into a blank wall of German cruelty and stupidity.
Every time we think we've escaped, you blindly and deliberately block us with some new outrage.
Mr. president...
Sit down.
Won't you Germans ever be civilized?
Won't you ever learn to keep your word...
Or to regard other peoples as men, women, and children, not as inferiors to be treated as you please, in the name of your discredited
German culture and race superiority?
I wish to withdraw...
We are not exactly fools!
We know about the spies you've sent among us in an effort to corrupt our opinions through lies and rumors and of your ceaseless attempts to sabotage our industry and commerce.
Unfortunately, some of our own people have fallen in with your plans.
Day after day,
I see them going up and down this country, crying out in their innocence that this is just another European war that can't touch America, building up a false illusion of safety and security, appealing to our ancient traditions of isolation...
While you smile behind their backs and go right ahead with your evil plans of world conquest and exploitation.
I bid you good night.
You will wait!
Is your kaiser so contemptuous of American military prowess?
Does he think we're so weak and disunited just because we prefer peace to war that we will not fight in any circumstances?
Or is he so drunk with power that he can't understand that such action will unite this nation as never before in its history and that he has made it clear at last that this is, in truth, a fight for freedom and decency against the most evil and autocratic power this world has ever seen?
Mr. Lansing.
Mr. president.
You will hand his excellency count Von bernstorff his passports immediately.
Good night, sir.
[Chorus]

* glory, glory hallelujah *
* his truth is marching on *
* glory, glory hallelujah *
* his truth is marching on * with a profound sense of the solemn...
And even tragic character of the step
I am taking...
And of the grave responsibilities which it involves,
I advise that the congress declare the recent course of the imperial
German government to be in fact nothing less than war against the government and people of the United States and that it formally accept the status of belligerency which has thus been thrust upon it.
Whoo!
In so doing, let us make clear to all the world what our motives and objectives are.
We have no selfish ends to serve.
We desire no conquest, no dominion, no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make.
We are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind.
We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and freedom of nations can make them.
It is a fearful thing to lead this great, peaceful people into war.
But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts...
For democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own government, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself, at last, free.
Through such a task, we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes...
Everything we are...
And everything that we have...
With the pride of those who know that the day has come when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness...
And the peace which she has treasured.
God helping her, she can do no other.

Good heavens. How many second lieutenants are there?
[Knock on door]
Excuse me, father.
There's someone here who wants to say goodbye to you.
Come in. Come in.
Felton.
Hello, Mr. president.
Mrs. Wilson.
Congratulations, lieutenant.
Thank you.
I don't want to take your time,
Mr. president.
I just wanted to say so long before I shoved off.
You're leaving soon?
I'm afraid that's a military secret, sir.
Yes.
Yes. Quite right, too.
Well, take care of yourself, felton.
Yes, sir, I will.
And... Don't be too impatient with us.
No, sir.
I'll try not to be.
Well, son...
Goodbye.
Goodbye, sir.
Goodbye, lieutenant, and... Good luck to you.
Thank you.
Thank you for coming to see me.
Thank you very much.
Very much.
Goodbye, sir.
[Door closes]
It's her,
I tell you.
Oh.
It couldn't be.
I'm sure of it.
Ah, don't kid me.
Why don't you go and ask her?
Find out for yourself.
O.K., I will.
Thank you, ma'am.
Lady...
Coffee.
They've been trying to tell me that you're the president's wife.
Really?
They can't string me.
You don't think
I look the part?
I say you don't.
I agree, but when you come back from France, if you come to the white house,
I'll do my best to look as I should, or better still, speak to the president himself about it.
There he is.
Slippery, aren't they?
I'll get you another.
You are the... the...
Even the president has to do kp occasionally.
Hiya,
Mr. president.
How are you, young man?
I never thought
I'd be shaking hands with you.
I can't wait to write home about this.
Only they'll never believe it.
Hello, Mr. president.
Where are you from?
Milwaukee, sir.
German?
My father was German.
I'm just an American.
And you?
My name's vespucci, but I'm just an American, too.
I guess there's something funny about all of us.
Mike here's a bohunk.
Me? I'm just Irish.
Tex here claims he's just from plain Texas.
Nobody told me any different yet.
Well, this is all very interesting, boys.
I want you to remember it.
Here we are, men of all races, with different backgrounds and ancestries, working together for a common purpose.
That's what's made
America what it is, and that's what the whole world must learn to do someday.
I know there are people who say this is just another war to protect the great fortunes or for some other economic reason, but don't believe them.
If anybody tries to tell you that universal peace is just an idle dream...
Tell him he's a liar.
Say your president said that you're fighting this war so there won't have to be any more wars, and that when we get through with it, we're going to sit down with other people who feel as we do and work out some plan which will make it unnecessary for boys like you and your sons to have to go out and shoot one another.
Maybe we'll call it a... a league, maybe something else, but whatever it is, that's what you're going to France for, and with the help of God, that's what you're going to get.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Company, fall in!
All right.
Get back on the train!
What are you trying to do, hold up the war?
Take it easy. We've just been talking to the president.
Says you!
All right, you...
See?
What did I tell you?
Carry on, sergeant.
Yes, sir.
All right, men.
Get back on the train.
So long, soldiers.
Goodbye.
Goodbye,
Mr. president.
Don't you worry about this war.
We'll take care of it for you.
Thank you, soldier.
Bye, sir.
For our part, we see very clearly that unless justice is done to others, it will not be done to us.
The program of the world's peace, therefore, is our program, and that program...
The only possible program...
Is based, as we see it, on these 14 points.
Open covenants openly arrived at.
Freedom of the seas.
Self-determination.
Free trade.
An impartial adjustment of all colonial claims.
League of nations.
Did you bring this month's casualty figures, Baker?
Yes, sir.
This is not one of my most pleasant tasks,
Mr. president.
I know.
112,000 of our boys dead so far.
That's only an approximation,
Mr. president.
All the figures are not in.
183,612 wounded.
The fighting's been heavy, almost ceaseless, in the past week.
Woodrow...
It's bad...
But try to think what these boys are dying for.
112,000 dead.
[Knock on door]
Come in.
Governor...
Yes, tumulty?
Governor, here's a message that just came from the Swiss military.
"The German government
"requests the president of the United States to take steps for the restoration of peace."
Woodrow.
Mr. president.
"The basis to be the program laid down by the president in his 14 points."
Thank God.
[When Johnny comes marching home again plays]
[Train whistle blows]
[Playing classical music]
So you're going to Paris to write the peace?
And to buy my wife a new bonnet.
Is that a smart thing to do?
To buy me a new bonnet?
I don't know how smart it is, but I consider it most essential.
Mr. president,
I was wondering...
It's only a thought...
No, thank you...
If your influence wouldn't be greater if you stayed here and served as a sounding board...
Thank you very much...
And if mistakes were made, you could repudiate them.
I hope no mistakes will be made.
Lettuce sandwich.
I'll get you another.
Don't bother.
Who'll go with you?
Lansing and house.
I meant someone from the senate.
Remember, they'll have to approve any treaty.
Whom have you in mind?
Senator lodge is chairman of the foreign relations committee...
And a very practical man.
Have one of these,
Professor.
Thank you, Edith.
Ah, one with meat in it.
That's the trouble.
Too many treaties have been written by practical men.
If I take anyone from the other party, it'll be someone like Henry white.
He's served in our Paris embassy, he knows Europe...
May I point out,
Mr. president, that this is the heyday of nationalism among nations.
In Paris you'll meet the ablest politicians in the world...
Practical men...
Many of whom will be concerned not so much with peace as with national boundaries, indemnities, new balances of power.
Many of our own people are going to share their views.
It might be wise to have a practical man along to cope with such people.
Mac, I agree with you as to the situation.
I disagree with you as to the solution.
In a world full of practical men, more practical men would hinder rather than help.
Our great hope lies not in me or in any other individual, but in the power of right.
People all over the world...
The common people...
Have set their hearts and minds against selfish nationalism.
They've paid with their blood and treasure.
I must go...
Not alone, as president of the United States, but as the spokesman for these peoples of whatever nationality.
Our own people expect me to go.
To do anything less would be unthinkable.
Well, I suppose if your mind is made up, there's nothing we can do about it.
Still, if it were up to me,
I'd take lodge, put him right out in front, make him help carry the load.
I'd keep my eye on the little...
Oh, excuse me,
Edith...
On that little goatee of his.
Thank you, senator.
[Chuckling]
They tell me in Italy they're even burning candles in front of his picture.
Kaiser woodrow.
Or is it
Saint woodrow now?
He's having a field day, but wait till that old tiger clemenceau gets through with him.
He'll be lucky to keep his shirt.
It's America's shirt I'm worried about.
This'll put a firecracker under him.
Maybe now he'll realize there's such a thing as the senate and the constitution.
All this business about remaking the map of Europe, giving away this, giving away that, talking about America not having any material interest in this war...
What about the money we lent them?
I don't think we need to worry, gentlemen.
We now have the names of 37 members of the
United States senate affixed to this document.
Senator lodge, you haven't expressed yourself.
Are you still with us?
My views on this subject are well known, gentlemen.
Nothing that has happened in Europe or elsewhere has caused me to change them.
You'll introduce the resolution yourself?
I should consider it an honor, sir.
Thank you, senator.
Mr. president, France can accept no treaty that does not include the saone basin and all territory west of the rhine!
But France has no right to that land.
It belongs to the people who live on it.
They can go where they please.
My government demands the land and its resources!
So do our people!
That's impossible.
When the Germans surrendered, it was on condition that we protect their rights.
That's written in the armistice.
You yourself signed it.
The Germans forfeited their rights in this war.
They are murderers!
Monsieur clemenceau...
I will never be a party to such an agreement.
It violates everything we said we were fighting for.
To take part of Germany and cede it to France is nothing short of theft.
You live in America,
Mr. Wilson, with an ocean on either side.
You can afford to be lenient with your enemies.
If you won't abide by the armistice,
I might as well go home.
If such a position to our just claims is continued,
I might as well resign!
You're breaking your word!
You are pro-German!
Gentlemen, gentlemen...
Let us consider these matters calmly.
We all believe in the self-determination clause of the 14 points.
It is not right to do wrong, even to make peace.
Besides, the covenant of the league of nations is sufficient guarantee of France's safety.
Under its provisions, there is not the slightest shadow of a doubt but that the United States and Great Britain will instantly rise to the defense of France should Germany ever again become hostile.
That's all very well,
Mr. president, when you speak of what America will not do, but are you prepared to guarantee what America will do?
I am.
Are you aware that a block of 37 senators have signed a resolution stating that the league as you propose it is not acceptable to the American people?
I am perfectly aware of that document, monsieur.
However, I should like to remind you that these men do not compose the entire senate, nor do they reflect the opinion of the American people, regardless of party.
As a matter of fact, some of the leading members of the republican party, including former president
William Howard taft and
Charles Evans Hughes, have expressed approval of the league...
And I will also give you my word for this, too, monsieur...
If these 37 men, who represent no opinion but their own, dare try to block, to thwart, to betray the first honest attempt of the world to achieve a permanent peace, the American people will rise in their anger and smash them as they would an alien enemy landing on their shores.
Mr. president,
I bow to you.
Shall we resume our discussion?
Now.
I've asked you here in the hope that we might come to some understanding about the league of nations.
I don't mean to be facetious,
Mr. president, but whose understanding...
Yours or ours?
One we can mutually uphold.
In view of our stated positions,
I wonder if that isn't expecting a great deal.
Senator, I'm sure we all have one purpose in common...
To serve the best interests of the American people.
Apparently, we have very different ideas as to what constitutes their best interests.
In that case, shouldn't we at least try to reconcile our differences?
The treaty would have been approved weeks ago if it weren't attached to your league.
Not my league, senator.
As a matter of fact,
I'd be more inclined to call it your league, for I seem to recall that in 1916, you yourself advanced the thought that the nations would have to unite for peace and that an international police force would enforce it.
The fact that a man has changed his mind does not bear on the real merits of any question, and even if he happens to be a convert, some good work has been done by converts from the days of Saint Paul to the present.
Besides, even in my wildest dreams,
I never contemplated placing American arms and economic sanctions every time some ambitious ruler coveted the lands and resources of another.
We should constantly be involved in broils and quarrels that are none of our business.
Yet let me remind you that in every discussion of peace during the war, we promised...
I beg your pardon.
You promised.
This government promised...
That...
Some way would be found to avoid such catastrophes as we have just been through.
Other nations have accepted the principles of the league.
It is inconceivable that we who advanced it should go back on our word.
If that is your unalterable view,
I'm afraid we shall not get very far.
Just a moment, senator.
Perhaps we've made mistakes...
All of us...
But regardless of the treaty or what you individually may think of it...
Or of those who wrote it, let me remind you that the league is irrevocably attached to it...
And the league...
Is the only hope...
The world has to avoid wars in the future.
Unless you can advance a better idea...
I beg of you to consider that and to help save that hope.
I, too, have my ideals,
Mr. president, and one of them is peace.
But a realistic peace that we can surely maintain, one which will not siphon off the power and prestige and resources of the United States.
If you had wanted my views on this matter, you could very easily have obtained them before you went to Paris, before you made concessions to the statesmen of Europe, before you burned all your Bridges behind you.
This is not the age of miracles,
Mr. president...
Nor of miracle workers.
America has but two choices, gentlemen...
It must accept a league of nations or live with a gun in its hand.
It's for the people to decide.
Thank you for coming.
Good day.
Good day, sir.
Mr. president.
Tumulty, you may start making arrangements at once for our trip.
Governor, your health...
I'll have no more haggling with that man.
I'll stump the country and let the people know exactly what's at stake.
But, governor, you know what Dr. Grayson said.
You can't afford to take the risk.
I promised the young men of this country that we were fighting this war to end wars.
It's up to me to see that we meant what we said.
Woodrow...
For my sake, why don't you do as they ask?
Accept the senate reservations and get this awful quarrel settled.
Don't you desert me, too, Edith.
I... I couldn't stand that.
My dear, I'm only thinking of you, of your health.
I have no right to accept any changes, and even if I did, they'd come back tomorrow with 46 more.
It's just a scheme to kill the league entirely.
Forgive me.
I should have known.
Whatever mistakes we've made about disarmament, boundaries, reparations, war colonies, the league will be in a position to arbitrate and rectify.
[Train whistle blows]
The league is the vital and compelling part of the treaty.
But there can be no united action, no league of nations in the true sense, without America's participation.
The isolation of the United States is at an end!
Mr. president, you'll have to give up this trip and return to
Washington at once.
That's impossible.
It's not only possible, it's imperative.
But I can't stop now.
People are beginning to understand.
If I desert them now, they'll be confused and misled.
40 speeches in 17 states in 22 days.
No one could stand it.
I'm scheduled to speak here in pueblo.
People are waiting for me.
There are several points that still have to be explained.
But you could speak here another time.
I wouldn't ask you to stop if I thought there was the slightest chance you'd be able to go on, but you'll kill yourself.
I must go on.
I'm all right.
[Crowd cheering]
People of pueblo...
My fellow citizens.
I feel like asking the secretary of war to get the boys who went across the water to fight together on some field where I could go and see them...
And I would stand up before them and say,
"boys, I told you before you went across the seas
"that this was a war against wars, and I did my best to fulfill that promise..."
[Train whistle blows]
"But I am obliged to come to you
"with mortification and shame and say I have been unable to fulfill that promise."
"You are betrayed."
"You fought for something that you did not get...
"And the glory of the armies
"and the navies of the United States
"is gone like a dream in the night,
"and there ensues upon it,
"in the suitable darkness of the night...
"The nightmare of dread, which lay upon the nations before this war came."
"And there will come some time,
"in the vengeful
Providence of God,
"another struggle...
"In which not a few hundred thousand
"fine young men from America will have to die...
"But as many millions as are necessary
"to accomplish the final freedom of the peoples of the world."
I will...
Thank you for coming.
[Wilson]
I am so tired.
Mr. tumulty, will you please tell the newspapermen we're returning to Washington immediately?
Yes.
No.
[Train whistle blows]
His whole left side is paralyzed, but his mind is perfectly clear and untouched.
Will he recover?
He'll improve with time, but for the present, he needs rest and quiet, release from every disturbing problem.
But how is that possible?
Everything that comes to the president is a problem.
Wouldn't it be better if he'd resign and let Mr. Marshall succeed him?
No, no, no, Edith.
He's staked his life on getting the league ratified.
If he resigns now, this incentive to recovery will be gone.
Besides, his resignation would have a very bad effect on the country.
For that matter, on the whole world.
Our thought is that you have everything of an official nature come to you.
You can weigh the importance of each matter, and, in consultation with the heads of the various departments, decide what he must see and what can be left to others.
In this way, Edith, you can be of great service to him.
No.
I can't do it.
It's too great a responsibility.
Even though his life may depend upon it?
In that case, there's only one answer.
I'll try.
Here.
Yes, ma'am.
Well, Mrs. president...
Woodrow!
What's on tap for today?
Don't you dare to call me that.
You know very well
I never even made one decision without your knowledge and consent.
I know it, and you know it, but do our enemies know it?
I'm not concerned with what our enemies know.
You should listen to them, my dear.
You'd learn a great deal.
Such as what, cousin woodrow?
Well, during the war, for instance,
I never would have dreamed that Edith was a German spy if I hadn't kept my ears open.
Nor, I suppose, did you bargain with wall street to bring on the war in the first place.
For that matter,
I never would have suspected that I was insane if the senate hadn't sent the honorable
Albert fall to look me over.
Oh, that man.
I don't see how you take it so calmly.
I'd scratch their eyes out.
Woodrow handled senator fall beautifully.
As he was leaving, that gentleman said,
"Mr. president, the senate is praying for you."
And woodrow, without batting an eye, asked, "which way, senator?"
I'm afraid
I'm much more concerned with what my grandchildren and their generation think of me than I am with what the present lords of the earth have to say.
No memoranda today?
They've passed the volstead act over your veto.
Well, now we'll have prohibition,
I trust.
Well, tumulty.
Governor, the democrats have nominated
James Cox of Ohio.
Cox on one side,
Harding on the other.
Cox for the league,
Harding against it.
Well, the lines are drawn.
It's clearly up to the people to decide.
[Piano playing]
Governor?
Yes, tumulty?
[Piano stops]
Governor, it appears that senator Harding has won an overwhelming victory.
Mm-hmm.
Senator Harding has issued a statement to the American people declaring that the league of nations is now a closed incident.
Thank you, tumulty.
Yes, sir.
Well, Edith?
Yes, woodrow?
If these good people will excuse us.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Is that everything?
That's all, dear.
Thank you, Mrs. Wilson,
Mr. president.
Thank you.
I'm sorry I can't stay for the inauguration ceremonies, but Mr. Harding and Mr. coolidge have been kind enough to excuse me.
I told them it was bad enough for the senate to throw me down without my stumbling up the steps on my own account.
Mr. president, I...
Eight years.
Goodbye,
Marshall.
Goodbye,
Mr. president.
Goodbye,
Mr. Marshall.
Mrs. Wilson.
Good luck, sir.
It was a pleasure serving under you.
Thank you.
Mr. president, I...
Daniels, we've taken a house in "s" street.
I hope to see you there often.
Yes, indeed.
Thank you.
God bless you.
Goodbye,
Mr. president.
Goodbye, Alexander.
Goodbye.
It's a great honor to have been in your cabinet.
Houston, thank you for your very able support.
Goodbye,
Mr. president.
Goodbye, Wilson.
Mr. president, now that the United States has rejected the league, can we ever hope for peace or real understanding between nations?
Yes.
I'm not one of those who has the slightest anxiety about the eventual triumph of the things
I've stood for.
The fight's just begun.
You and I may never live to see it finished, but that doesn't matter.
The ideals of the league are not dead just because a few obstructive men now in the saddle say they are.
The dream of a world united against the awful wastes of war is too deeply embedded in the hearts of men everywhere.
Goodbye,
Mr. president.
Goodbye, Mr. Payne.
And I'll even make this concession to Providence it may come about in a better way than we proposed.
Goodbye,
Mr. president.
Just woodrow Wilson now.
You still have one minute to go,
Mr. president.
Goodbye, sir.
Goodbye, Baker.
Goodbye, Edith.
We hope to see you often.
Mr. president?
Senator lodge.
Mr. president, a joint committee of the house and senate is here to notify you that congress has completed the business before it and now stands ready to adjourn, unless you have some further message.
The president has nothing further to communicate.
[Clock chimes]
Good day, sir.
* long may our land be bright *
* with freedom's holy light *
* protect us
* by thy might
* great God
* our
* king
Ng made possible by Turner entertainment group and U.S. department of education there. See that?
We didn't see nothing, stranger.
I seed you sewing, though.
First time I ever see a man sew like that.
I done tailoring.
How much you want to sew the seat in a pair of britches?
I don't want work here.
I'm going west.
I don't, uh, aim to take something for nothing.
I'll patch them britches.
Pretty square tailor, ain't ya?
Sit down till I get my garment.
Where you coming from, stranger?
East.
Where you heading?
West.
What do you want out there?
Land.
Don't talk much, do ya?
Not unless I get something to say.
Here she is.
Uh... it might take a week of filing.
If you get your nippers, you could...
You're a fugitive.
I'd be aiding.
You, uh... I...
I was, uh, I was bound to a tailor back in Carolina.
Runaway apprentice?
You don't look young enough for that.
You think I'm lying.
Well, here.
Read this.
When an apprentice lights out and gets caught again, he's got to serve out his time, don't he?
Miss Eliza!
Miss Eliza! Look!
Well, where'd you get that?
Howdy, miss McCardle!
Oh, good day, blackstone.
Hello, Sam, Mordecai.
Hello, Mrs. Fisher.
Good afternoon.
You know those new boxes of books that came?
I figured out how much shelf space is wanted, see?
If you could bring some boards and a hammer and some nails...
I'll be right up to the library, miss McCardle, soon as I get Mrs. Fisher's mule shoed up.
Hello, sheriff.
Good afternoon, mcdaniel.
Mordecai, who is he?
Says he's an apprentice what lit out.
That what it says there?
Here in Tennessee, across the state line.
As pay for this file here and be getting down the road.
Never mind the britches now.
Come here.
Put your foot up here.
It might hurt some, tailor.
It hurts worse where it is.
What the Sam hill?
Well, that's like spring steel!
Yeah. Get your hammer and chisel.
But it'll half-kill you!
It's been too long
I got this thing on.
I'm warning you, you might lose your ankle.
Will you get your chisel?
Go on, get it!
He wants to be muleheaded...
Speaking of mule...
Gram of white mule might help some.
I... i can't touch that stuff.
It makes me sicker than a hound dog.
You know, this town could maybe use a man like you.
Don't talk much, don't drink, lots of spunk.
Ain't been a tailor hereabouts since ol' Finney got drunk and sewed his finger to a leg of the parson's pants.
I ain't looking to do tailoring, ma'am.
One can't get to own land all chained up.
Man who can sew like you could soon buy an acre here.
Lots of folks here ain't got no basement in their britches.
Brace his foot.
Good morning!
Morning, miss McCardle.
Morning, miss Eliza.
Oh, that's a fine job, Mordecai.
I'm getting a pair of brand-new britches for doing this.
I thought those old ones of yours would be too much for any tailor.
Well, Mrs. Fisher!
Them cobwebs ain't been swept out since the grangers lit out west, miss McCardle.
And I'll be choking and spitting for weeks to get the dust out of my lungs.
Well, aren't you a good neighbor?
I ain't been messing about in there to help that mulehead.
I'm a-getting paid.
I'm gonna have the first new dress since the one I wore the day the parson tied me up.
Good morning,
Mr. Johnson.
Morning.
We haven't exactly met before.
I'm Eliza McCardle from the library across the street.
Yes, miss.
Everyone's so pleased to have a tailor here again in greeneville.
Thank you, miss.
I-it saves so much trouble, not having to take my cloak and dress down to Nashville.
Am I your first customer?
Oh. It was you left that?
I guess you are, then, miss.
Is my work ready?
Oh, you shouldn't be about on that foot.
It does a man's foot good getting a shackle knocked off it.
Of course.
Everyone's talking about what happened at the blacksmith's shop.
What happened at the blacksmith's ain't nobody's business!
Mr. Johnson.
I forgot myself, miss.
Don't... don't pay no mind.
I'll take my clothes now, if you please.
There ain't nothing been done to them clothes, miss.
Those clothes.
But the instructions are plainly written.
I know, miss, but...
I can't read.
"Will you please lengthen the dress 2 inches at the hem and mend tear in cloak."
I'll have it fixed tomorrow.
Oh... how much will it cost?
I ain't asking no favors from anybody, but...
A fair bargain's a fair bargain.
I don't understand.
You... you know about books?
A little, yes, but I asked you how much my work would cost.
And you speak nice.
"Them clothes" I said.
I corrected you.
It just slipped out.
It was forward of me, I'm afraid.
No, miss.
I... I... I got to learn to speak right.
You speak about the nicest I know of.
Miss McCardle,
I'll sew you all the clothes you can bring me homespun if you'll learn me to read and write.
Your proposal,
Mr. Johnson, seems rather unusual.
Miss McCardle.
I'll think it over.
I...
I'm making you a fair offer.
I never had no chance to learn.
Will you learn me?
I have never had a chance to learn.
Will you teach me.
Will you teach me?
"There is a lady sweet and kind,
"was never face so pleased my mind,
"I did but see her passing by, and yet I love her till I die."
Please go on.
It's past time to close the library.
Got to get home and read something besides poetry.
Andrew...
You've learned to read almost as well as I.
You've made so many new clothes for me, it's almost sinful.
Why do you want to go on with the lessons?
Is this the... words, I read somewhere, are verses the heart sets to music.
Eliza, there's...
Music inside me that almost drowns out my thinking.
But I'm a poor man and the law says a white man without property is nothing but a mudsill for other men to wipe their boots on.
Why, no law says that.
It don't have to say it... it's true, ain't it?
Your people owned a house and land.
How did my father get a house and land?
By cobbling shoes for 20 years.
My father was nothing but a mudsill, and he died one.
Poor white trash, that was him, and that's me.
I'll be going now.
Andrew.
Don't you know we were all mudsills once?
Forget the history of england for tonight.
Read your own history.
Here.
The declaration of independence.
I've heard that spouted by stump speakers every fourth of July since I can remember.
Maybe you didn't understand it.
Read this part here.
"We hold these truths to be self-evident:
That all men are created equal."
They're fine words, but they ain't true.
Ain't no equality for mudsills.
Go on.
"That they are... Endowed by their creator
"with certain...
Unali-Ali..." unalienable rights.
Rights no man can take away.
Well, they have taken them away.
What are you making me read this for, anyway?
Go on.
"That among these are life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
Why, a man ain't even got a right to vote without he owns property.
Then why don't you make it your business to see that men without property are given the right to vote?
My business?
Certainly.
You've got a temper, Andrew, but people like you.
Go out and talk to them.
Make speeches.
Stand up for your rights and theirs, too.
People wouldn't listen to me.
I think they would.
Anyway, the constitution says you can try to make them listen.
I suppose you'll be making me read the constitution out loud to you.
I will... if it will help you to understand it and realize that everything in the bill of rights and the declaration, too, means you, personally... you, Andrew Johnson.
It seems as if...
Maybe I never really understood this before.
The constitution, neither.
I suppose plain people can't agitate the way you want me to in them foreign countries.
Those foreign countries.
Those.
No, of course they can't.
The reason this is a free country is because here, what's wrong can be set right.
Whatever is wrong has got to be set right by the people.
You're the people.
This is your country as much as theirs.
It's my... my fish in the stream.
Your flag on the fort.
It's life, Liberty...
Finish the sentence, Andrew.
And the pursuit of happiness.
They're all yours... the pursuit of happiness, too.
The pursuit of happiness.
And it says we were created...
Go on.
Equal.
What it says must be right, Andrew.
Created equal, you and me.
Yes, Andrew.
"Votes for all free men."
More than a year now, he's been putting leveling ideas like that into common folks' heads, sheriff.
Mm-hmm.
White trash got enough to do hustling to make a living.
And not sticking their snouts into what don't rightly concern them.
Goes on like this, he'll rouse up the whole county.
Too many property interests involved, sheriff cass.
You see, Mrs. Johnson, them that own the country should run it.
A man with land pays taxes, don't he?
So ain't it right that he should have a say how the money is spent?
Now you tell your husband to leave voting to the men of property.
They'll look after the interests of folks like you.
Surely, that's a matter of opinion, sheriff.
You have no right to keep him from speaking.
The bill of rights says there should be no law made to abridge freedom of speech.
We're living in Tennessee.
Well, we ain't abiding by no federal laws, less'n they suit us.
Nothing's legal in this town if the aldermen don't like it.
Now, they don't like tailors rousing up the white trash and making leveling speeches.
Good night.
Now don't forget, you tell Andy he ain't gonna hold no more meetings.
He's got a temper.
Better make him see reason, else'n he might get hurt.
Evening, Eliza.
Evening.
You're late for supper, dear.
I had to go over and fit
Mr. Bronson's coat.
What was that hard-shelled, rum-dipped sheriff doing here?
What's the matter, Martha?
Hey, she ain't sick, is she?
No, it's just her teeth bothering her.
She used to sleep all the time.
Now take your coats right off.
Andrew, I kept a nice bit of salt pork warm and those baby cabbages you like so much.
There's plenty for Mordecai, too.
That's mighty fine of you, but it'll taste just as good cold.
It's time to get my notes and go to the meeting.
You'd better mind little Martha.
I'd make a lot better speech with you there listening.
Why, Eliza, you're all tensed up.
Andrew, that meeting last week, there was some trouble, wasn't there?
It didn't come to anything.
Yes, but if one night it did, if someone got hurt...
Eliza, what... what was cass doing here?
Ain't exactly like the sheriff to come social visiting.
Eliza?
Well, he came to say that the aldermen won't allow the meeting tonight.
Won't allow it?
Well, I've got a peace to speak.
That's what free speech is in the constitution for, so's I can speak it!
Come on, milligan.
We'll get our friends.
What he really came to say was, you can't hold meetings at all anymore, or you might get hurt.
Andrew, put away that gun.
Please. Stay home.
No, Eliza.
Andrew, you shan't do this.
You shan't!
Nothing can keep me from going.
Andrew!
Mordecai!
Don't worry none, Eliza.
I promise, nothing will happen to Andrew.
Mrs. Johnson!
Mrs. Johnson!
There's been a bad ruckus at the town hall!
No. No, you mind the baby.
My husband!
What happened?
Where are they?
Them that got hurt was carried over to the blacksmith's shop.
Water!
Get some water!
Wh-where is he?
Where is he?
Anybody want to buy a first-rate blacksmith's shop?
Mordecai milligan's dead.
Where are you going?
To get sheriff cass.
That ain't no private affair of yourn.
How many men can we get together?
I got close to 20 cousins in the county who ain't standing by and see me get no hammering.
And how about milligan's kin?
They ain't gonna put up with his killing.
We could raise 100 men by midnight.
Them with no guns have scythes and axes.
Round 'em up!
Let's get started!
If it's killing they want, let's give it to them!
If I hadn't toted that gun, milligan would be asleep in his bed in there.
Not dead in it.
That's right!
And we're gonna make 'em pay for it!
Put down those weapons!
You're quitting on us, tailor?
I ain't never quitting.
From now on, never.
Then come along!
Join the party!
You begun this, Andy, with your meetings and your telling us to stick up for our rights.
You led the scrimmage when the sheriff's buddies started throwing us out the hall.
You done more than your share of fighting your own self.
Who pulled the gun first?
It'll take me more than all my life to pay for that.
He's quitting on us!
Come on!
No!
Mob fighting, shooting, and hanging and burning... that ain't the way!
Eye for eye, tooth for tooth!
That's Bible!
So you want to start killing.
First you kill, the militia comes from Nashville, then they start killing.
And the dead they leave are you, maude Fisher.
And dick, you.
And ebenezer, you.
And Ethan, you.
And you.
And you, mcdaniel.
Yes, I tell you to fight for your rights.
But the constitution ain't for the dead, it's to protect the living!
Ain't nothing in it I know of says not to hang a murdering sheriff!
It says the law hangs murderers!
It says the people got the right to make the laws!
That's us!
And that's how we're gonna win our fight election day!
And when we win it, we'll get cass indicted!
How?
Lots of us ain't even got a vote.
You ain't got no vote, Andy.
Well, a lot of us have.
Come November, I'm gonna have my acre paid for and a vote.
Then we can elect one of our own sheriff... a common man, one of us.
Now you're talking crazy.
Who'll we get?
None of us is fitting.
Most of us can't hardly read.
We ain't good enough.
We ain't got no rights!
Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
Those are our rights, as well as theirs.
It's our fish in the stream, our... our flag on the fort.
Hey! What about the tailor?
He's fitting!
That's right.
Andy would be good.
Me?
No.
No, I...
I ain't fit enough.
You can read and write and figure!
And you can speak.
And you can fight.
How about it, Andy?
You're good enough.
And fit enough.
Eliza's right!
Andy for sheriff!
We can put you in!
We'll beat their pants off and let you sew 'em up!
Andy for sheriff!
We want him!
We want Andy!
He'll be the sheriff!
We want him! We want Andy!
He'll be the sheriff!
They put me up to do the introducing, here in greeneville, of some old friends that don't need no introducing.
Most of you younger folks didn't know this lady here when she was miss McCardle, a-passing out books at the library.
And there's her daughter Martha.
You remember her.
Many of you played in the streets with her.
And now she's grown-up, too, married, and has a little boy of her own.
And I almost forgot.
There's a man here, too... a man that got his start in politics when a bunch of us made him run for sheriff.
He said he wasn't fit enough.
Well, he's been fit enough to be made sheriff, assemblyman, congressman, governor, and now he comes back to his home folks in his own town as senator of the United States.
No, I ain't gonna introduce him, not in greeneville.
Welcome home, Andy!
Welcome home!
I guess blackstone mcdaniel is right.
I don't need any introducing to you.
I've patched the britches of a lot of you.
And your father's britches before you.
I'm still wearing that first little dress Andy made me.
My friends...
I have been a jacksonian democrat all my political life.
I hope we will lick the Republicans this fall and send Abe Lincoln back to splitting rails in Illinois!
But people here in the south who threaten to break up this country if Lincoln is chosen President forget that, in our America, the verdict of the majority
must be accepted.
That is what I will say in the Senate in Washington even if Lincoln is chosen President.
Whether you back me up at home here in Tennessee, or whether you don't!
We of the south have lost the election!
Very well!
Mr. Lincoln will be inaugurated
President in 6 weeks!
The people have spoken!
Let the will of the people be done!
And I hope and believe we shall do so!
Meanwhile, we southerners should remain here and prevent him from carrying out policies that will ruin this country... our one country!
Enough of this yankee cackle, you renegade to the south!
I repeat, our one country!
Does any senator dare to challenge that?
Let us keep in our hearts the immortal toast of that great democrat,
"our federal union, it must be preserved."
In the noble words of Daniel Webster:
"Liberty and union, now and forever, one and inseparable."
The senator has been making that same speech here day after day for the past two months...
Like a parrot.
What can you expect from a mudsill tailor, elected by the rabble of the city among the gentlemen of the south?
I'm proud of having been a tailor, and I'd rather sit among the rabble than some of you self-appointed gentlemen of the south.
I demand an apology!
An apology for what?
Mr. President!
While the Southern senators make this place a beer garden, business north and south is at a standstill!
And who is to blame?
Yes, who is to blame?
You are! You are!
Maybe, the north, if you force us to fight for our liberties, then we'll fight you!
Don't you shake your fist at us!
We're not your slaves!
Don't you yell at us!
Well, you started it!
Gentlemen!
This is the Senate of the United States, not a pot house!
Order in the galleries!
Order on the floor!
Jefferson Davis.
He's finally got here.
It's about time.
Now he can speak for all of us, for the whole south.
The chair recognizes the senator from Mississippi.
Mr. President of the Senate...
Senators...
I appear here...
To announce to the Senate that
Mississippi, by solemn orders...
And in convention assembled...
Has declared her separation from the United States.
In so doing, she has followed others of her sister states on whose behalf, as well as my own,
I must pronounce our solemn farewell.
Under these circumstances, of course, my functions and those of my colleagues, terminate here.
We but tread in the path of our fathers when we proclaim our independence, and take the hazard, putting our trust in god, and in our own firm hearts and strong arms...
We will vindicate the right as best we may.
I see now around me some with whom I have served long.
There have been points of collision.
For whatever offense I have given,
I ask forgiveness.
Or whatever of offense that has been to me,
I leave here.
I carry with me no hostile remembrance.
I go hence unencumbered of the remembrance of injury received...
And having discharged the duty of making the only reparation in my power for any injury offered.
Mr. President...
Senators...
Having made the announcement which the occasion seemed to me to require...
It remains only for my colleagues and myself...
To bid you...
A final...
Adieu.
Now that Tennessee has left the union and joined the confederacy,
I denounce Andrew
Johnson as a traitor to the sovereign state of Tennessee!
May your black tongue rot in your throat, you liar!
No man can call me a traitor!
Andrew.
Oh, thank you, Andrew.
I was so afraid there would be violence.
From now on, there will be nothing but violence, Eliza...
Nationwide violence.
No, it mustn't come to that.
Isn't there some peaceful way of settling it?
The Southern senators walked out.
They declared war.
I'm going to Lincoln now and offer my services to raise troops in Tennessee and fight for the union.
Where's the general, sir?
At his gun.
Captain brenner!
Message from general Williams?
Only rabble, sir.
General Williams was in action, trying to rally the zouaves.
Trying to rally them?
What's happened?
Our center is broken!
General Williams asks that all available reserves be sent to him immediately!
There are no reserves!
The rebels just sent over another white flag, with a demand to surrender Nashville!
You order general Williams for me to shoot any man who talks of surrender!
Yes, sir.
4 more years!
4 more years!
Boys! Boys!
Close the window!
Come on.
Let's get on with business.
Gentlemen... not that anyone cares, of course, but we have one more tiresome formality, now that we've done our duty by old Abe... wasn't us delegates renominated
Lincoln by acclamation.
The country done that.
Sir, I'm not accustomed to being interrupted.
Thad Stevens...
Most of us delegates ain't congressmen, and you can't treat us like you do that tame cattle of yours down in Washington.
Eh... my Pennsylvania delegation, and some others that I have friends in, will support anyone you men decide you want...
Just agree on a name.
Well, there would be no trouble if Lincoln would let us know who he wants on the ticket with him.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Well, it looks as though the white house decided to tell us something.
Uh, clear out of here, you men.
How do you do?
Oh, so glad to see you.
The President hopes you're better, congressman Stevens.
Thank you, thank you.
Afternoon, senator waters.
Afternoon, b.p.
White house, Senate, house of representatives.
What we three agree on ought to go down with this mob.
The President is very grateful for the plank and the platform that favors full emancipation... well, I wrote it myself.
But he wasn't so happy about that other plank you forced in.
Oh. That one demands that the rebels and traitors are punished after the war.
What's wrong with that?
Well, he feels that it's a blow to his policy of reconciliation.
Well, that's just why it's there.
Heh heh. Come on.
Let's quit playing marbles.
Lincoln sent you down here to see Jim and me. What for?
To discuss the Vice presidency.
Yeah, he wants to shove Andy
Johnson down our throats.
The President feels that Johnson, a democrat, will be supported by the democrats who backed the war and so will help us win the election.
He says to tell you that...
A Vice President from a rebel state will strengthen the union, that the American people can never repay their debt of gratitude to Andrew Johnson.
Oh, Johnson's a loyal man, uh...
But as a southerner, he'd be bound after the war to try and stop our vengeance on the south.
Mr. Lincoln does not approve of vengeance on anyone.
In the interest of unity, he's anxious for unanimous nomination, no contest on the floor.
You tell the President
I'll support his wartime policy until the last rebel's dead or quits.
He knows you will.
The President regrets that you don't agree with him on reconstruction, but he knows that you stand with him on the two important issues... victory and freedom.
I fought slavery all my political life.
What's that got to do with it?
Oh, a great deal.
Why, Johnson stands with you and Lincoln there.
He once said in a speech,
"I do not mourn over the dead body of slavery.
"I think we're freeing more whites than blacks in Tennessee."
I wouldn't want to free a
white man if he was a rebel.
Well, I've said all the
President asked me to say.
What Lincoln wants will go down with the delegates, then.
What the President wishes will go down because you and the other delegates know that the country is behind him.
Good afternoon.
Thad, you can't fight
Lincoln on the floor here.
If he wants Johnson, you better make it unanimous.
The power of the rebel and...
Next Vice President of the United States.
The oath of office will now be administered to the Vice President-elect by the Chief Justice of the
United States supreme court.
Mr. Vice
President-elect.
Mr. Chief Justice.
Raise your right hand, sir, and repeat after me.
I do solemnly swear...
I do solemnly swear...
That I will faithfully execute the office of Vice President of the united states...
That I will faithfully execute the office of the Vice President of the United States...
And will, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend...
To the best of my ability, preserve...
Protect, and defend...
Protect, and defend...
The constitution of the united states, so help me god.
The constitution of the United States, so help me god.
The President of the United States!
Mr. President...
Senators...
Judges...
People of the United States...
Who are...
Are more...
I ask your indulgence.
Drunk again.
Heh heh...
I ask your indulgence during my term of office...
I, a plebeian, have studied only how best to advance the...
Interest of my state and country...
I have... Risen from the humblest walks of life to this... this... this... Proud position.
"...with malice toward none."
This is the way he wound up, Eliza.
I wish you'd got to town in time to hear him.
I wouldn't have heard him.
I'd have been right here, looking after you in bed, where you belong.
They sent me this this morning.
It's a photograph of the inaugural ceremony.
See, there he is, reading his speech.
The people will gaze on that picture for ages to come.
Where are you, Andrew?
There I am, my dear, in the custody of Hannibal Hamlin.
The cool air out there cleared my head.
You see, I'm holding my hat over my face.
Perhaps you can guess why.
Now, don't you want to hear what they have to say about your husband's speech?
No, Andrew, please.
"After being sworn in,
"the new Vice President indulged
"in an incoherent harangue,
"concerning which,
"the less said, the better,
"in view of the obvious condition
"of the man between whom...
"And the presidency stands only one human life..." stop, Andrew.
You were ill.
I disgraced my President.
I disgraced... My country and our cause.
Come in.
From the white house,
Mrs. Johnson.
Flowers for you and a letter for Mr.
Johnson.
Thank you.
Aren't they beautiful?
I...
I'm afraid to open this.
Oh, you needn't be.
Mr. Lincoln sees deep into all hearts, and he knows yours... all wool and a yard wide.
"You ornery old galoot.."
"If only you took a drink now and then,
"you'd know enough about liquor
"not to fire yourself up with Brandy on an empty stomach when you're sick."
"I know you only went through the ceremony for me
"because I asked you to.
"Don't worry at what they say.
"In hitting at you, they're hitting at me, and I don't mind."
"We've got Lee all but whipped.
"You were a good tailor, Andy,
"and you're going to help me now, you poor, loyal cuss, to patch up the torn garment of our union."
"Gratefully yours, a. Lincoln."
Didn't I tell you?
Three cheers for Vice President!
Hooray!
Hooray! Hooray!
Evening, Mr. Johnson.
I'm afraid all this noise will be disturbing Mrs. Johnson.
I'm awfully sorry, but there's nothing we can do about it.
That's perfectly all right.
She only wishes she could get out and join in the jollification herself.
She'll be up tomorrow.
Sleep well,
Mr. Vice President.
We'll all sleep well now, the first time in 4 years.
Oh, just a moment, please, sir.
I forgot something, if you please.
This gentleman called while you were out.
No, I don't know the name.
Probably he's just some office-seeker.
Hello, hello, dear.
Oh, I can feel it even lying here in bed.
It's a new Washington since Lee surrendered.
New country... same crowd, same bands all over the north.
People don't seem ugly or vindictive now that we've won, do they?
No, this is the start of a new era of good feeling in a United States...
really united and for the first time.
And we both know whom the country has to thank.
Yes, we all know, except that little knot of his enemies down on capitol hill.
His enemies and yours.
Mm-hmm. Heh heh.
Just listen to that noise out there, will you?
We want Andy!
They're calling for you, Andrew.
We want Andy!
We want Andy...
Stop the music!
Stop it!
Yeah! We want to hear Andy!
My friends and fellow countrymen, hang Jeff Davis to a sour apple tree!
Hang Lee, too!
My friends...
Never mind me.
You go around the corner and serenade the President, but don't grieve him with shouts about hanging our fellow countrymen.
Come on down, Andy, and have a drink, you old toper!
We just came from there, Andy.
Ain't nobody home.
Abe Lincoln's gone to Ford's theater.
The few words I shall say to you are not my own.
"With malice toward none,
"with charity for all, let us bind up the nation's wounds."
And general Grant, when he took Lee's army...
There was no pride, no boasting.
He just said,
"let us have peace."
Now, you trust and follow Mr. Lincoln to guide us under god...
For 4 years more!
Oh, splendid, Andrew.
You said just the right thing.
Now, you try to get some sleep.
Let's hope there will be no more bands to keep you awake tonight.
I will.
Here, what are you reading?
Poetry.
"There is a lady, sweet and kind,
"'twas never a face, so pleased my mind."
Oh, please don't close the doors, and don't you sit up working half the night.
I won't. Just a half-hour or so.
Ye.
Who is it?
Mr. Johnson...
The President's been shot.
Don't go, sir.
There's murder all through the city.
Secretary seward has been stabbed at his house, and we got here just in time to save you from an assassin outside your door.
It's a general conspiracy.
I'm going to the President.
You must stay here, sir.
I'm posting a guard outside.
I must go, Eliza.
Of course you must.
Now he belongs to the ages.
It is now my duty to ask when it will be convenient to administer the oath of office... Mr. President.
All right, major, take these away.
And, uh...
I want that report on the freedmen's bureau to work on tonight.
Thank heavens there's nobody else waiting here to see me.
Has this young lady an appointment, major crooks?
She didn't ask for one, sir.
Here, here, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Major, don't forget those two bills.
Got to write a couple more veto messages after dinner.
I must have seen 60 people in this room today, and you're the first one didn't come in to ask me for something.
Where did you get your flowers?
I picked them on the lawn with Martha.
She just had the children out there for a romp.
How did they stand the trip from Nashville?
They loved every minute of it.
It'd be kind of homelike, Eliza, to have Martha and the kids living here.
This place seems sort of lonesome.
I don't know...
Maybe it's just the job.
Must be the lonesomest job in the world.
Such a big place, isn't it?
Glad I don't have to pay the taxes on it.
And so full of ghosts.
Ghosts that are hard to live up to.
I bark out at people.
He knew how to turn 'em down with just a funny story.
The wonder of it...
That you should work in his study...
Sit at his desk.
The terror of it to ask myself every day, every hour,
"what would he have done?"
And not to know.
Eliza...
I ain't fit.
Andrew, it came to us at milligan's forge that you were fit to be sheriff, and you've grown a lot since then.
You trying to tell me that I'm fit to follow him? You know better than that.
To follow him who is...
Whoever will be.
The trouble with me,
Eliza, I was never fit to lace up his boots, let alone stand in them.
You were the man he chose,
Andrew, to stand in his boots if anything should happen to him.
Oh, let me.
I told Martha she could bring the children in to say good night.
I must be the first President with grandchildren here.
We'll let them come in every night.
Grandpa, my doll!
Isn't she beautiful?
Oh, isn't she?
Hey, Andy, Andy!
Hey there, Andy!
Well, now, what have we got here?
Major crooks gave it to me.
It's a gun to shoot bears.
Well, now, we'll go out tomorrow morning right after breakfast and shoot us some bears.
Come on!
Let's go now!
Tell me a bedtime story, grandpa, like you always used to in
Nashville when I was little.
All right...
Here... we go.
Well, now...
Once upon a time, there was a beautiful Princess.
Oh, look! There's a great bad bear!
Come in, gentlemen, come in.
You know my wife, my daughter Mrs.
Paterson, the children...
Congressman Stevens, senator
Waters, and congressman Hargrave.
Yes, it's quite a thing to have a typical American family in the white house again, Mrs. Johnson.
It's a great pleasure to welcome you to Washington, ma'am.
All Washington hopes,
Mrs. Johnson, for a revival of the fine old white house traditions of before the war.
Well, then I'm afraid Washington will be disappointed.
Oh, we're just plain people from the hills, that's all.
A brief stay in high places can't be expected to change us very much.
Martha...
Now, children, it's your bedtime.
Grandpa hasn't told me my story yet.
Well, he'll come up and tell you one in bed.
Promise?
Yes, I promise.
Now, you say good night to the gentlemen.
Good night.
Good night. May I have a kiss, little one?
Yes, if you want one.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Do you want to have a kiss, too?
I couldn't think of anything more delightful, but I'm not going to submit you to any such dubious pleasure.
You killed the bear!
I didn't mean to.
Now, children, that's enough.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Well, we've had enough homespun humor in the white house.
Let's quit being whimsical and run the country.
Sit down, gentlemen.
You know, I've often thought if I could speak with your culture and learning...
With your eloquence,
Mr. hargrave, or the power and force that you blast your opponents with, Mr.
Stevens...
I'd probably make a much better President.
Why, Mr. President,
I've never found you lacking in eloquence, sir.
But unfortunately, you are as stubborn as the orneriest mule in your own Tennessee.
He just plants his feet wide apart like that, and you couldn't budge him with a Cannon.
A mule, huh? Is that why you fellas in congress lit a fire under me?
You don't act like our fire done much more than keep your belly nice and warm.
Unfortunately,
Mr. President, the contraption you're hitched to is the United States of America.
We've got to keep it on the move.
Stevens, if you'll just state your case and let me state mine,
I think we'll see better where we stand.
Very good,
Mr. President.
I propose that we treat the south as an outside conquered people, that we confiscate all estates worth $10,000 and containing 200 acres.
Then, sir, I would give every adult colored man
40 acres of land...
Sell the rest and pay for the war with it.
No use vetoing that program, Johnson.
We have the votes to override your vetoes.
So it comes to this:
You fought a war to preserve the union.
Having preserved it, now you deny that it exists.
Gentlemen, my one aim is to carry out Lincoln's policies.
Try and get into your head that Lincoln's reconstruction program died with him.
Oh, shut up, waters. Let the
President state his own case.
That they were therefore never out of the union.
Now, they stopped fighting.
They took the oath of allegiance to the United States.
They ratified the amendment abolishing slavery that you yourself, Stevens, piloted through congress.
Yes, yes, yes.
It follows from Lincoln's policy that they therefore were entitled to the same rights as the rest of us.
Now, gentlemen, it's just as simple as that.
Well, no use making him our offer now, Stevens, after what he just said.
Offer? You have some compromise to suggest?
I should think it would be rather difficult to compromise our points of view.
I never compromise.
I came here to make a deal.
To secure your cooperation with us, Mr.
President...
For the next 8 years.
Oh, I see.
That's an offer to buy me...
With a second term.
One practical man to another, yeah.
What in tarnation is that thing?
What you're trying to put on my leg again, and I don't like being chained up.
That's why I've kept this for nearly 40 years now... just to remind me what being chained up feels like.
Well, gentlemen, there's a little girl waiting for me to tell her a bedtime story, so I guess that's all.
No, that's not all, Mr. President.
That's only half.
Wait outside, will you?
I want a word alone with the President.
Good night,
Mr. President.
Good night, gentlemen.
Good night.
First, Lincoln tried to block me.
Now it's you.
Well, that's a poor substitute, but... now me.
Stevens, why did you want to see me alone?
To tell you that since you've turned me down,
I fear I'll have to turn you out.
Impeachment?
You know the house would prefer charges of high crimes and misdemeanors against you anytime I say.
I hope that never happens.
Fortunately, it takes a
2/3 vote of the Senate to sustain a conviction.
That's the constitution.
You're a great stickler for the constitution, aren't you?
Well, you might as well know, then, we can get you out by strictly constitutional means.
Why aren't you more reasonable?
And when there's no Vice President, the man who succeeds an impeached President is the acting presiding officer of the Senate.
Right, right.
Well, they'll never put me out to put Jim waters in.
Well, that is kind of funny, at that.
The Senate would never have elected him to pound that gavel if they realized that it might make him President.
I have infinite faith in the people.
Oh, this country isn't ruled by a plebiscite.
Congress would be against you and the money power and the press...
Yes, every power would be against me...
Except the common people that Abe
Lincoln said the lord must have loved because he made so many of them.
Go ahead, then, take the stump.
Swing around the circle.
Make your speeches to the people...
Only you get all het-up.
You don't make very good speeches.
Yes, and you'd rig the press and pack my meetings.
Well...
We're not likely to meet socially anymore, so I have to tell you that nothing would make me do what I fear I have to do, no personal or party interests, just one thing:
The safety of our country, which your policies would destroy.
You have the impudence to sit there and tell me you're doing this to save the country?
Why, you hypocrite, if you weren't a cripple,
I'd pick you up and throw you through that bay window right out on the white house lawn, wheelchair and all!
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
You know, most people think that drink is your weakness, on account of that thing that happened at the inauguration.
But I know better.
It's temper.
I've got to see
Mr. Stevens at once.
You can't, sir.
He's sick, Mr. secretary.
The doctor just left... now, don't argue with me.
Thad, he's turned me out.
The tailor turned me out.
You've got to do something to help me.
Now, sir, Mr. Stevens is a very sick man.
You can't be bothering him.
I won't let you.
Mr. Stevens, you've got to rest.
Oh, Addie, what do they care whether I live or die, as long as I hold a job?
Now, please, sir, don't say nothing about dying.
There it is, thad.
Read it.
Run along, Addie.
If'n you get the lung fever, don't blame me.
I done told you, the doctor, he say you've got to get your rest.
So the tailor threw you out, huh?
And after all the trouble we took to have that bill passed that he couldn't fire any of Lincoln's cabinet without the express consent of the Senate.
He's violated a law passed over his own veto.
That's going to cost him the presidency.
I've got him just where I want him.
Now, you go back and stay in your office.
But I've been dismissed.
You don't think I'm going to let him do a thing like that to you?
Now, you go and get some troops and a couple of Cannon to protect the building... troops? Cannon?
Sure. And just stay in office.
You mean, never leave it?
Leave it?
No, of course not!
You just stay, stay, and stay.
You better get a bed and some canned food, because in all probability, you'll be there for 3 or 4 months.
But after Johnson's out and Jim waters is President, then you can go home and get all cleaned up.
I'll do exactly as you say.
Ah, it's amazing what privations a politician will endure just to stay in office.
Here's the last report on the cabinet meeting, and that's the last bit of what you call "spying" I'll have to do for you.
You never can tell.
I might want you to spy on Jim waters when he's President.
Addie! Addie!
Yes, sir?
Come here!
Yes, sir, Mr. Stevens!
Order my carriage.
Tonight, in this rain? No, sir!
You'll get your death of... order my carriage!
If'n you go out in this rain and get the lung fever... get me my crutches!
Yes, sir.
Telling me what I can do and what I can't do.
Yes, sir.
I'll do what I want.
I'll die when I feel like it.
The President will see you now.
What's this about some amnesty idea of yours, Johnson?
So your spy in my cabinet told you that, too.
Well, after you broke up my meetings,
I got to wondering whether I had any powers left at all, if I hadn't better resign and go back home.
Oh, cut the cackle.
And then I remembered a power vested in the President by the constitution that even congress can't touch, Stevens.
Maybe you can guess what it is.
A power congress can't touch?
Yes. Lincoln would've got around to that before now, but I had to wait till things settled down a bit.
You wouldn't dare.
That's right, you've guessed it... the pardoning power.
I'm going to sign something now, and I'm glad you came over here to watch me do it.
Here at this desk where
Lincoln freed the slaves,
I now free their former masters.
This proclamation pardons all and restores full citizenship to all who fought for the lost cause in the war between the states.
All? Did you say all?
All.
Not Jeff Davis?
Jeff Davis, too.
Lee?
Oh, yes, Lee, as well.
Well, you're right... you have the power.
Congress can't stop you.
Now every rebel snake in the south will crawl out of its hidden den into the daylight.
Johnson, what you've just done tonight...
And what you plan to do...
Means a new civil war.
You honestly believe that, don't you?
You know I do.
I haven't long to live.
Just kept alive for the day of retribution and justice so I could die happy, knowing I'd bequeathed the country peace.
Peace?
You call revenge, confiscation, and disfranchisement peace?
Have you no pity for those 4 million injured, depressed, hopeless colored people under bondage for two centuries?
I want the two races to live together peacefully, to respect one another.
Your way of making slaves of the whites would put that off another century.
Johnson, if you withdraw this thing...
For the sake of peace,
I'll quash the impeachment.
So you'd drop the impeachment.
Yeah.
Well, Stevens, I decline your offer...
But I want to tell you one thing.
I never really understood you until this minute.
I always thought you wanted a puppet President you could boss.
I called you a hypocrite, but you're not.
You're a very Sincere man...
And that's what makes you so dangerous.
You have the sincerity and will and force.
You have the drive of a great fanatic.
You'll not Rob me of all I've lived for.
You'll not ruin the country with another war.
I'll live long enough to stop that.
My policies will go through with you out of the way...
Even if I'm not here to see it.
Stevens... what's the matter with you?
You'd better let me get you some coffee.
Huh? No.
I'll crush you, Johnson.
I'll save our country yet.
Stevens.
Stevens! Major crooks!
Mr. President.
What happened?
Get a doctor.
Uhh...
Would you deny any other tailor his day in court if you were his lawyers?
If I took refuge in your technicalities and cowered here in the white house while you fellows fought for me in the Senate, what could Stevens call me?
Whatever he calls you,
Mr. President, he mustn't spatter you with mud and filth while you sit there in person.
Yes, like a man in the dock.
A President is more than a man.
He's a symbol of the whole nation.
And that's why, for the sake of the dignity of your office... you can't fool me! You're afraid if I went down there,
Stevens and his gang would bait me in making a howling jackass of myself.
That's your real reason for trying to keep me from going to my own trial.
Well, I choose to face my enemies in person.
I'm going to the capitol.
Come along, gentlemen.
Andrew...
Wish me luck, Eliza.
There's no hurry, Andrew.
Why sit down there alone in the President's room fidgeting until they summon you?
The President will drive to the Senate a little later.
Will I have time?
Oh, yes, Mr. President. The preliminaries and the swearing-in will take another hour or so.
You see?
Reserved seats.
Reserved seats.
Huh.
It's like walking into Ford's theatre knowing what's going to happen.
Yes, another assassination of the President.
Any statement for the a.P., Mr. Stevens?
Don't quote me, but I think I got the tailor just where I want him.
But for quotation?
"The days of the tyrant are numbered." Unquote.
The country's greatly disturbed about your illness.
Tell the country I'm all right.
I just had a stroke, that's all.
No further statement.
Thank you, Mr. Stevens.
Who's going to carry me about when you two boys are dead and gone?
The President of the Senate pro tempore recognizes the spokesman for the house of representatives.
In the name of the house of representatives and of all the people of the United States, we do impeach Andrew Johnson,
President of the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanors.
We shall exhibit our articles of impeachment and make them good.
In fulfillment of the mandate laid down in article one, section 3 of the constitution, the Chief Justice of the supreme court shall preside over the Senate when, as now, this body is called to sit as a high court of justice in judgment upon the President of the United States.
The honorable Chief Justice!
Your honor.
The chair recognizes
Mr. Stevens.
Mr. Chief Justice, before the 11 articles of impeachment are formally read, let me state to the
Senate and the country the essence of our indictment.
We do not intend to cite the obvious fact that Andrew Johnson is unmindful of the dignity of his office... his disgraceful speeches of rage, if not intoxication.
We will confine ourselves to the constitution and the law.
Now, in a public speech, the
President of the United States suggested hanging certain elected representatives of the people, including myself.
He has denied, also in a public speech, that this congress is a lawful body.
He has termed us an "illegal rump" because we refuse to admit what he terms
"legally elected representatives of states in the American union," meaning unreconstructed rebels.
Now, our main case, however, is based on his violation of a law passed over his veto by congress:
The tenure of office act.
Now, everyone in the country knows that that forbids a President to dismiss from his cabinet any member who was belonged to the cabinet of a President who died in office.
Now, in so doing,
Andrew Johnson, who was sworn to maintain the constitution, created the highest possible constitutional crime.
If this is condoned, congress will be powerless.
It will be ruled over by an irresponsible tyrant.
So the house of representatives, by solemn resolution, has instructed us, its managers, to demand that the Senate, as made mandatory by the constitution, forthwith summon and do justice upon the accused, Andrew Johnson.
Hear ye! Hear ye!
Hear ye!
All persons are commanded to keep silent while the Senate of the United
States is sitting for the trial of the articles of impeachment.
Summon the accused.
Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, appear and answer the articles of impeachment exhibited against you by the house of representatives of the United States.
Andrew Johnson.
Andrew Johnson.
Andrew Johnson!
What's this mean, thad?
Ahh, Johnson isn't coming.
Mr. Chief Justice, the President desires to be represented throughout this trial solely by his council.
Mr. Chief Justice, the President has been summoned and refused to appear.
This action defies the Senate, congress, and the whole American people.
We demand that he be brought before this tribunal and stand his trial like any other man accused of crime.
The constitution does not require the presence of the respondent.
The chair rules that he may, at his wish, be represented by council.
The clerk will now read the articles of impeachment exhibited against Andrew Johnson by the house of representatives.
"Whereas Andrew Johnson,
President of the United States, has been accused of conduct..."
Well, blackstone, it's good to see you.
Andy.
Come on in here now and sit down.
Oh, I, uh,
I wanted to, uh... wanted to thank you for calming down the folks back home.
Sit down, sit down.
Well, what's on your mind, now?
Things ain't so good down there, Andy.
What, in greeneville?
The Senate.
Sitting there at my trial every day, listening to the way they kick me around kind of makes you sore, huh?
It sure does, Andy.
Now blackstone, here's the way I figure:
Out of 54 votes, they need 36 to get the 2/3 for conviction.
Now we only need 19 for acquittal, and we know we got 16 to start with.
Wish I knew where those other 3 were coming from.
Why, from honest senators who really believe that I violated the constitution when I got rid of that spy in my cabinet.
But they'll switch when they hear the truth from the other cabinet members.
You go on back there now and listen to our side.
Andy...
What I come up here for to tell you before anybody else did was, uh...
They ain't gonna let your witnesses testify.
Who won't?
The Chief Justice?
That's not possible.
He's an honest man.
Oh, he ruled for you, all right, but the Senate overruled him on every point.
Now, now, Andy... don't fly off the handle.
Well, I expected everything but this.
Accusations of drunkenness!
Galleries packed with my enemies howling and yelling against me!
Even that old charge in congress that I conspired to murder Lincoln!
But I never expected this!
Well, I'll... I'll issue a statement to the country right now.
It's too late, Andy.
They're gonna start voting right soon.
I should have gone down there and stood up to them in the beginning.
This is no state trial.
It's a criminal conspiracy!
They're... they're doing this to me because I'm trying to carry out his policies.
They'd be doing it to him, too, if he were alive and in my shoes!
They'd be trying to destroy the...
Andrew!
People all over Washington are gonna hear me shouting!
People all over this country are gonna hear me shouting!
Those senators up on that hill are gonna hear me shouting!
Once more I must caution the galleries to keep quiet.
Mr. Chief Justice, the case for the house of representatives and the people of the
United States is concluded.
After the closing speech for the defense has been made, vote will be taken upon the guilt or innocence of the President of the United States.
Mr. Chief Justice... the President!
The President?
Mr. President, this is highly inadvisable.
You should have notified us.
I've been waiting a long time for this.
Mr. Chief Justice, the closing speech for the defense will be made at his own desire by the respondent.
That will be in order.
He'll blow up higher than a kite and cook his own goose.
Mr. Chief Justice... will the President please be seated?
After repeated warnings, the chair now orders the attendants to clear the galleries.
Clear the galleries!
Mr. Chief Justice, I protest against your order to exclude the people from this chamber where their fate is about to be decided.
There's an organized focus of disorder.
The ruling of the chair must stand.
I move the galleries be not cleared!
I second the motion!
Those in favor of overruling the chair, respond by saying aye.
Aye! Aye! Aye!
Contrary, no.
No. No. No.
The ayes have it.
The galleries will not be cleared.
The Chief Justice of the United States must now decline to preside over this body while an organized clique denies respectful hearing to the President of the United States.
Article 1, section 3 of the constitution says the Chief Justice must preside when the President is impeached.
True. But I must decline to continue to do so, on the grounds that it was obviously the intent of the constitution to place the Chief Justice in the chair in order to insure a fair trial.
Under the constitution, this trial cannot proceed without the Chief Justice in the chair.
Of course, a way out of the difficulty might be found if the galleries would cease these interruptions.
Now that order has been restored, the President will proceed.
Mr. Chief Justice.
If, as has been charged,
I have sometimes not been mindful enough of the dignity of my office,
I am certainly mindful of it now.
I kept away from my own trial, following the best advice I know of, to avoid the sort of rough-and-tumble that would heat up not only this body but the whole country to a fever point where riot and bloodshed might have swept our people.
I am charged with the high crime... or is it a misdemeanor?
Of making speeches in a state of mingled intoxication and rage.
You were drunk inauguration day!
You know you were!
The attendants will remove the interrupter!
Please, Mr. Chief Justice,
I... i want that man to hear my answer.
Very well.
I have a letter in my pocket.
I didn't bring it down here to read to the Senate.
I have it with me because
I always carry it.
It's my most precious possession.
I shall now read a few lines from this letter as my only reference now or ever to what my...
My friend in the gallery has touched upon.
"You ornery old galoot,
"if only you took a drink now and then,
"you would know enough about liquor not to fire yourself up
"with Brandy on an empty stomach when you're sick.
"I know you only went through the ceremony for me
"because I asked you to.
"Don't worry at what they say.
"In hitting at you they are hitting at me, and I don't mind."
This letter is dated from the white house march 5, 1865.
I just heard that the Senate had refused to hear the evidence of my cabinet.
Gentlemen, prepare to prove that my removal of a cabinet member was solely intended to test the constitutionality of the tenure of office act before the supreme court.
So... i won't deny that I was a little hot under the collar when I left the white house.
But the ride down Pennsylvania
Avenue cooled me off.
And I came to realize that the crime for which I am being tried here is not contained in the flimsy charges trumped up in the articles of impeachment.
It appears to have been one of misunderstanding.
I thought the war had ended.
No enemy confronted us on any field.
The hand of friendship was stretched out, and I clasped it.
Is forgiveness a crime?
My enemies think so.
They're not willing to forgive.
For senators in this crowded chamber, there still stand 20 empty desks.
Why are those desks empty?
Where are the senators who should be sitting at them?
They have been lawfully elected, but they're not here.
Why?
The man most responsible for the fact that we are still at war, although the guns are silent, sits there at that table.
I wish to say that he is a Sincere man.
It is his honest belief that by pardoning the confederate leaders,
I made inevitable another civil war.
He hates the south with such consuming passion that he thinks, as he has said, that it must be kept in subjugation and slavery for the next 100 years.
If I am removed from office, the new President, who shares the sentiments of Mr. Stevens, will set up a junta that will be no government of United States, but a self-perpetuating, corrupt tyranny based upon bayonets, confiscation, and disfranchisement.
Abraham Lincoln fought this war to restore the union.
Long ago, the fighting stopped.
But while those desks remain empty, there is no union.
Senators, while we were fighting one another, a European tyrant, master of the strongest army in the world, seized our sister Republic of Mexico.
If we continue a divided nation, the day will come when still stronger armies and fleets from overseas will conquer and enslave not only our central and south American brethren, but ourselves as well.
As our forefathers knew, united we stand, divided we fall.
Senators, the issue before you and before the whole country is not my faith as an individual.
It is the issue of union or disunion, and upon its solution depends, for our descendants if not ourselves, this nation's survival or its destruction.
The event is in the hands of god.
Order must be maintained in the galleries.
The clerk will now call the roll.
Mr. Albert.
Mr. senator Albert, how say you?
Is the respondent, Andrew Johnson,
President of the United States, guilty or not guilty?
Guilty.
What goes on?
It's huyler.
He's fainted.
Go get a doctor!
We can't do without him!
Mr. Arnold.
Mr. senator Arnold, how say you?
Is the respondent, Andrew Johnson,
President of the United States, guilty or not guilty?
Not guilty.
Mr. President.
Andrew, Andrew.
Oh, Andrew.
As my husband, you've always held my love and respect, but today you really stand forth for me.
The President of the United States.
Well, Eliza, I'm glad to hear you say that, since I'm not likely to hold this job for more than a couple of minutes longer.
Well, if that should be true, nothing, nothing in your presidency has become you so much as your leaving it.
Then this means if you can vote huyler... we'll vote him.
We're gonna carry him in, drag him in.
The voting's nearly over.
Come on.
Man, even with Howard, the whole thing turns on me.
Just think what it means, asking me to make myself President with my own single vote... judge in my own cause.
Stevens isn't asking you.
He's telling you.
But he agreed the dignified thing was for me to sit there and just answer "present" when they called my name.
He told you that when he thought we could win without you.
What will the country say if the case turns on my vote?
What will history say?
Mr. senator Vincent, how say you?
Is the... guilty.
Senator Vincent, is the respondent, Andrew Johnson,
President of the United States, guilty or not guilty?
Guilty.
Mr. waters.
Mr. senator waters, how say you?
Is the respondent, Andrew Johnson,
President of the United States, guilty or not guilty?
Guilty.
Good old Jim.
We're still one short.
Well, huyler can still vote if he gets here before the acquittal's announced.
He's unconscious.
Well, bring him to.
We mustn't lose the country by one vote.
I think we're safe.
I'm must go and tell him.
Not so fast.
The formalities will take another minute.
We might still lose if they get huyler in here to vote.
Upon the roll call,
53 votes were cast, and one senator did not answer to his name.
Under the constitution...
Huyler just came to.
They're dragging him in here.
Hurry up. I'll keep the Chief Justice from finishing the announcement.
...necessary for conviction.
Mr. Chief Justice, in the name of the house of representatives and of the people of the
United States, I protest!
Senator huyler has publicly announced he was going to vote guilty!
The manager is out of order.
Senator huyler must vote.
His vote is necessary to save the country.
Would you throw the nation into chaos and start a new civil war on a point of order?
Andrew Johnson,
President of the United States, has been adjudged guilty by 35 senators.
If this outrage is consummated on this floor, guns and knives will be brought into play within the hour... on every street corner, in every city, town, and
Hamlet in the United States!
You stand in most gross contempt, sir!
Remove Mr. Stevens from the floor.
Senator huyler's vote should be counted, anyhow.
Everyone knows it was pledged against Johnson.
A new civil war, that's what you're starting... a new civil war.
This is the most gross miscarriage of justice in human history.
If the Chief Justice pronounces those words that are even now trembling on his tongue, the only hope for the salvation of this...
Here's huyler!
There you are, huyler.
Good, old boy.
I knew we could count on you.
Mr. Chief Justice, the roll call was completed.
The President stands acquitted by one vote.
Mr. Chief Justice, under the rules, any senator who appears on the floor before the result has been announced has the right to vote!
The chair had not completed the announcement.
The clerk will call senator huyler's name.
Mr. huyler.
Mr. senator huyler, how say you?
Is the respondent, Andrew Johnson,
President of the United States, guilty or not guilty?
The senator need not rise.
My...
My vote is pledged.
I say...
Not guilty.
You're acquitted, sir.
Andrew! Andrew!
35 to 19.
Senator huyler's vote.
One vote!
Mr. President, congratulations!
35 to 19!
Huyler decided it.
You should have seen thad Stevens' face!
On behalf of President Grant, of the Senate, and of the entire nation, the chair extends welcome to the new senator elect.
Before the gentleman from
Tennessee is escorted to the bar to take the oath of office, the Senate would welcome a few remarks from the only former President to be elected a member of this body after he left the white house.
Mr. President.
Senators.
My... my fellow
Americans.
When I last occupied this... this seat in 1861,
I was surrounded by empty desks.
Now I see that they are no longer vacant.
Virginia and the carolinas,
Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas, Mississippi, Florida,
Arkansas, and Georgia.
You are all back in the fold as Tennessee stands here in your midst.
I...
I see as I greet you who sit here about me that what Lincoln fought for, lived for...
And died for, at long last, has come to pass...
The union of these states.
One and inseparable.
Now and forever.

They're all coming to the mill!
We'll get engaged today. l've told you everything will be arranged. Are you happy?
- You must come, that's why l ran here.
Let's go. - No, l'm staying here. l'm sorry...
This is for you.
You're really beautiful today.
Go, run, don't make him wait.
Bye!
Hey! l'm here!
Ah, at last.
It's cooked, mother.
- Here, take.
- l think it's just fine.
Scansafrasca salutes you!
What a nice smell.
Master Cecilia!
Come on, come on!
Oh, here we are.
At least we got here.
- Oh, Berta!
- Master Cecilia, here we are! l'll send you the boat.
Move, didn't you hear?
And let hose books,
''who can read, pays taxes''.
- Bravo! Did the horse take you up to here? - He's also from this parts.
- Hey, take your pigeons. - And you do me a favor and tie the horse.
- l've got 7 brothers... - l said l don't want you looking in the mirror.
- It was for Orbino. - Here she is, the Madonna of the Seven Graces.
- If Orbino wants her, he must take her even ruMed. - Yes, mother.
Come on, move it, come outside.
They've all here, come as soon as you've loaded. - Alright, alright, mother.
- Good day, master Cecilia.
- Oh, good day!
- Even grandpa Michele is here.
Good day. - Good day, good day. l'll steal his betrothed, l can still do it.
Do it, do it!
- The pair of pigeons is for you,
Berta. - You'll learn how to make love.
- Here are some eggs and other things for you. - You're omending me.
Unfortunately, l know you. To make you
Scacerni accept something...
That's how we are. Nobody can change us.
- Hello to everybody!
- Best wishes to the betrothed!
Thank you, today there's drinks for all.
- We'll come at the wedding!
- Hey! - Hi, Orbino! - Hi!
- Careful, you're capsizing the boat.
- Good breed...Verginesi.
- Thank you, they really are beautiful.
Good breed, male and female, good ones!
- Good day. - Good day. - Step in, step in. Make yourself at home.
- They really are beautiful. - I saw your dovecote was empty.
- They'll keep you company.
- We'll put them in right now.
At first, let them get accustomed. Feed them here every day.
- If not, as soon as they can, they'll fly away. - For now, l'll lock them in.
- Are you happy, Berta?
- Because of the pigeons?
You know it! This time we'll get married.
- l can climb down very well by myself.
- Can't l even touch your hand? l'm happy we're getting married.
And love you, l do. Since long ago, since we were children.
And you know it.
- Hey!
- But there's no one!
Enough! Enough!
Don't you want to see my trousseau?
What a mother you've been to your children: all know it, master.
Nothing, only my duty.
And now that the children have grown up and we could fare better...
...the government lays taxes on milling and puts counters at the machinese.
- Acu_se_ piemontesi.
- ''Everyone with his cross'', master.
You the counters and we the new boss.
We, the Verginesi, have lived in
Coguazza for 300 years.
And he, just arrived, treats us... we ''cry for vengeance to Heaven''.
- This, enough, finished.
That's what is. - But...
I know by myself how the trousseau of a
Scacerni should have been...
...had things been dimerent.
But l hope that before the wedding l'll be able to enlarge the dowry.
You've done so much for us, mother, we'll never forget it. l'm very happy like this, if you're too...
Even without nothing, Berta. , ''Do no harm, fear not'' master.
Why are you fretting? The fabrics are good and we're satisfied.
We've done, in all good conscience, all we could.
- And then... Iet's drink to that joyfuly! - Very good. Let's go.
Make yourself at home, drink.
Oh, wait, there's still time before you take her away.
- Didn't you bring the violin?
- He learns, learns, and never plays it!
- Long live you all!
- Long live the bride and groom! Drink!
- Drink!
- Cheers!
Come, boys, get drinks!
All of you!
- Two well-of families.
- Mother, the taxes police.
Have you detached the counters?
Careful! l'll go, mother.
- Where's Scacerni Cecilia?
- Here l am.
- And these, who are they? - The
Verginesi from Coguazza, sergeant.
What do you want? You read the counter
15 days ago. - We'll read it again.
Hey, you, wait a moment. Can't say you're not in good health, ma'am? lt does me good to see you here often, playing masters of my house. lt's a solace.
- Why are you so worked up? - Because of the arbitrary way we're dealt with.
Because never has such abuse befallen millers.
The strings are at their place, everything's regular.
And at every turn, a penny the governmnet robs from our pocket.
Better this way. This is for you.
Sooner or later, this slacker that busts our balls even when sleeping...
...l'll throw it in the Po!
- Who are you talking about?
- The counters! - Just try!
You've already been caught without the strings once...
...and then even a second time.
Here, put it somewhere, but where it can easily be seen, miller's wife.
- And what would that be?
- The proclamation with the penalties.
First time: Fine
Second time: Three times the fine.
You'd be at the third.
At the third fine: jail and confiscation of the mill that'll be auctioned.
- What?! - No more talk, place it well in sight.
To Hell with it!
Watch your fist, it might hurt you, one day or another.
Goodbye to everyone.
Wretch!
In the Po with this slacker!
- Is the pole that anchored the other mill still there? - Yes, there it is.
This is the chain my garndpa put.
The first of the Scacerni to go into milling.
Last year it was much closer to the water.
Every season, earth is carried away, the banks change. lt never settles down.
Who knows in 100 years where the banks will be...
Did you think it was a stream?
It is the Po!
That's where the Pane Perso went down and nothing was found.
After we'll marry, you'll live on firm ground, where the river can't get you.
Look, Scansafrasca's fish nets, the rope must have broken.
We must catch them!
If he loses the fishnets, the poor man...
Berta, they're too far away!
Be careful, you'll get all soaked up.
- Go on the other side.
- l'm not going in!
They're here, Scansafrasca, l've saved them!
Hey, thank you!
Well done, Berta!
- Hi. Here they are. - l've taught her not to be afraid of the river.
- l don't like water too much. - But you've taken a miller as wife.
And couldn't have made a better choice!
Orbino, l salute you, l'm going back.
Can't stay here in wet clothes.
Scansafrasca will take me to the mill won't you?
Bye!
- Bye, Orbino!
- Farewell, Berta!
Tricked again your mother, eh?
- Couldn't you take me to them in daytime? - To women, one goes by night.
Mooched flour, well done.
- You're starting to be a man.
- Let's go! - You really are in a hurry!
You'll see news tonight, politics.
Believe me, this is serious talk.
Beyond Po the thing's already done.
All are in it together, peasants and day labourers.
And owners go through one of those frights.
Now, we should also start it here, at us.
Unite the forces of the workers, be all on one side.
- Did you hear him?
- It could be...
Shall we go?
Why did you bring me here for?
The League chief, Raibolini, said you're a man who likes justice.
But what do l care about the
Workers' League? l'm a miller, l don't have to ask anyone for anything.
This is middle-class selfishness, today we need class awareness.
''All for one, and one for all''.
This is the proletarians watchword...
...in their fight against capital and exploiters.
- Home! Go home!
- Let me go!
She's not for you.
And you millers must end your arrogance!
- A word to the taxes police would suMce... - The taxes police?!
This is out of the question. We'll take care even of you, of your taxes.
Oh, hell! In our mills we do as we see fit!
And we don't give a damn on tax police, government, and all ofyou!
And if we want to take om the strings, come nose around...
...if staying alive smells bad to you.
Ah, you're going away? l'm warning you, think well, who is not with us, is against us.
What a good talker you are!
His loss...
Tomorrow you'll visit the dairies, see them all.
The Vegri, Coguazza, the Ronco...
Propagate the idea and one day they'll be with you, you'll see.
- The scarecrow is ready.
- Well done.
Put it in the field, behind the old house.
This League will be the peasant's socialist future. Understood?
It will be the union of farm workers, farm tenants and day labourers...
...against capitalists.
And we will show the owners.
Have you understood?
We must all be in it, sign in, because it's ours, the workers' union.
- You, a worker? - Yes. - But you've done nothing since you were born!
But it's about the League, the peasants... Don't you get it that...
Has ever anything good come from
_e Piarda degli Stamplinati_
You plant celery and grow thieves.
We, Verginesi, have never had anything to do with bums.
The trees! Come you all!
- Luca! - What is it?
- Luca!
Quickly, we must stop them! Run!
But what's happened?
- They want to cut the trees!
- Cut the trees?! - Yes.
- No! - Who's sent them,
Clapasson? - Yes.
Come.
Oh, Holy Virgin!
- Stop it! Nobody touches anything.
- It's you we were waiting for! lt's with you, big head, that the boss wants to speak.
He has ordered you to cut them down.
Tell your brother not to... l don't know anything about it, big head or not, you'll touch nothing. l'm only telling you this: Here nobody touches anything, not a tree, not... l had warned you, hadn't l? l'll shoot the first chicken l see in the fields. lt's my as well as your interest.
The one that made most eggs!
Problems, eh? l was expecting it.
With hyo obstinate rednecks like you...
Say it, say it all, l already know it all by heart, don't l?
"They've always been here, our forefathers did that, grandpa planted them..." lt's their beauty.
Our forefathers have planted them for the summer shade, mister commendatore.
Forget the titles, I'm the owner, call me mister owner''. lt's soaked wood, even the leaves are not good.
There's enough shadow for an army, holy cow!
If the ancestors did it, it means they were animals.- But during so many years...
"So many years ago" doesn't mean anything to me. Imagine you were a boy.
Come, we'll cut everything down and turn them to fertilizer. l'm sure we can irrigate it with those springs...
...and feed much more animals!
It's in your best interest too: the peasant must become partner with the owner.
Honest partner, let's make it clear.
With the developpment of agriculture, we'll get more from the land, us both...
...owner and peasant.
You must put your trust in me. ln me, not in those trouble-makers that roam around subverting the peace.
Have you got it? Do you understand it's to our common advantage? l'll cover the expenses.
Are you in? l'll pay in advance.
Hey, l'm talking to you, Verginesi! l understand, the owner is always the friend of new things.
We don't know how to read or write and we don't want to owe money to the owner.
And giving up the old ways and starting new ones...
These are things the son of my father doesn't want to do, he wants to continue like before.
- My father's son?! - Yes, that's what he says. - The s... The sons of...
Sons of... l don't say whose!
And l'm losing time with ignorants like you!
''The son of...'' Well, l deserve it, giving leeway to hyo pumpkins...
...to hyo obstinate rednecks who think themselves above the owner...
...because they pissed for hundreds of years on the same farm!
The whip we'd be good for you!
The whip! lf the new terms you're omering us would really be advantageous ones...
...we'd see it for ourselves.
I even admit they might be advantegeous, and you might be right...
...but you should show charity!
The ancestors that have always toiled, damn it, should be respected!
- Who's this boy?
- Orbino, our nephew.
- Tita's, the one that died.
- So, a Verginesi that thinks?
Strange, l hadn't expected it.
So, then, you who understand, tell him that until now I tried convincing him...
...but now it's an order.
Either you do it my way, or l'll fire you. In one word, I'll throw you out!
Fire us? - Yes! And down with the trees.
Come on, we already wasted too much time.
Come on, boys, get to work.
For the new contract l'll be waiting you on Sunday.
Everything here must change, you can't even imagine it.
Or, if not, l'll fire you...
- Fire us! - Us, Verginesi, that've been here for 300 years!
And he, this piemontese, because he's the owner...
O Lord, punish Clapasson, turn him into a madman...
...so he ends all his mad thoughts!
Punish the owner,
O Thee our Lord...
Grandpa, don't you know misfortune befalls he who calls for it? lf you don't want to miss it in the time of need...
...you must now look for help at the League. or what will you do, all alone, when the owner will throw you out?
On Sunday there's the meeting.
You, Verginesi, come also.
It's in your interest.
These beggars!
- Let's go, let's go. - Wait, mother,
Iet's hear some, l want to have fun.
Because you've seen your friend, that bandit of Smarazzacucco.
- Bravo!
- Let's sse this great novelty!
Hey, Caterinone!
- Even Caterinone has come! - He hasn't moved from his mill in 20 years.
- Even master Saladino from P_arda deINano's here. - And the Tampinelli_.
- All the millers are here, all of them.
- Let's go with them.
- Good day, master Cecilia.
- Good day.
Where are you going? We're in the back, listening to the meeting.
The meeting's starting.
Let's go! Move down there.
All must come.
We will be preaching today.
The meeting's opened!
Come, attack.
Silence!
Silence!
What do you think you've come to listen to today?
You're used to tre speeches of those you send in Parliament.
And you aspect from me the same empty words you get from them.
Because they are gentlemen, bourgeois...
...that know nothing about you, and your needs.
But l'm a proletarian like you, and like him: Amilcare Cipriani.
And l tell you that what you'll be hearing from me today...
...the others have never told you...
...because l'm speaking in the name of a new doctrine: Socialism!
The doctrine we must defend against the hate...
...and the hidden plots of bourgeois.
Citizens, one moment!
Citizens, hear me out!
- l had told you to wait for Lupacchioli.
- Alright, speak. l should have been first, no?
Give me the flag.
This is the flag of free thinking.
''l salute you, Satan'', as the poet says it, rebellion!
Citizens, in the name of Satan, salute and brotherhood!
Go hide yourself, Lupacchioli, old senile! ln the name of free thinkers...
Long live Princivalle!
Long live Princivalle!
Long live Princivalle!
He's really mad!
Shame on you, heretic woman!
Hold this, hold this a moment.
Silence!
Citizens, the priests' obscurantism...
...the seven hundred headed hydra... l meant 70.OOO!
700.OOO!
Long live Princivalle!
Silence! Silence!
You're ruining my meeting with your problems. l'm taking you the speech, you'll wait until after me!
Down with that flag! l've said down with that flag.
And you, down there, if you think you're smart, l'll...
Come to the mill, Raibolini, l'll teach you how to fish pikes with your mouth!
Bravo!
Bravo, Princivalle!
And don't understand their defence is here.
Tell me what good you've seen from all the government's reforms...
...starting with the monetary one!
Workers, peasants, employees, what is it you're asking for?
Just bread and work.
But bread and work aren't enough.
You have the right not to be exploited by those that don't work!
Because the age of capital is past.
Who doesn't work, must not enjoy others' toil.
And, l tell you, this is the new law of Socialism!
Factories to the workers and land to the peasants!
You're God sent to have said these words!
But you're making the apology of crime!
You're preaching social hate!
What are you waiting to intervene? - Be calm. - You know what l'm saying?
Four bullets in the heads of those ruining the people...
...would be good work. l'm going away,
Iess l'll make something rash.
Follow them, follow them!
See where it'll lead you to!
But we must fight...
Fight for a better future!
For the socialist society!
Where we'll be brothers!
Where there'll be no wars, nor injustice!
Let's not look at our sacrifices,
Iet's make a future for our children!
Workers! Unite!
I'm going back to the mill and I won't budge from there for another 20 years.
- Nice doing! Bumoons!
- Not one word about milling.
Go home! Only nonsense!
And Princivalle?
Now you can speak.
Up the flag!
Citizens...
Citizens, the meeting will not be over...
...until we'll not have exhausted the most important topic...
...at which l've now come to, and l protest
Protest against the Vatican!
Protest against the holidaymaker on the right bank of the Tiber.
Reverend, please, Don Cipriano.
We'd like to know if this
''Land to the peasants'' is an heresy.
Because if it's a sin, we don't even want to think about it. ln matters of faith, it is not, so it can't be heresy.
Thank you, Don Cipriano.
_ut, ''Cristiani in primis et ante omnia''...
...being afraid of the Lord and Christian charity.
- Remember that. - Good day, reverend. - Good day. - Reverend.
- Come, inside! Come sign.
Let's go! - Come, come!
We've seen him there, in the back!
Princivalle!
On this wind...
- Shall we go?
- Yes.
- Where are you going now?
- l don't know, leave me be.
No, priest,
Satan doesn't go back!
Happy? You didn't like me?
- Let me be.
- l'm in love, Princivalle. l didn't think l'll ever be again, but it's true.
You're a man, you're strong... l like you!
- What's all this about? - l know who l am! And l know you very well also.
Once in a while it's enough for me and you're not bored with me yet.
You dirty...!
He's talking to you!
- You're both disgusting! - Ah, he's talking to us! Take her!
Bum! Thief! Go away!
Go away or l'll take your eyes out!
Auch, what blows!
What blows!
You, miller, l know how to get even with you! You'll see!
- What do you mean?
- No, don't go!
Quickly, Giovanni it's alone at the mill.
- Princivalle should be there helping him.
The usual compassionate mother!
How did it end with Clapasson?
Well... He must be liking me and even you, millers.
He's a little mad, but he's not bad and he knows about peasantry.
Orbino, were you bewitched by the
Iand idea?
Berta, move it, this wind carries floods and there's no time to waste! l'll go ahead.
- l'll come with you.
- It's not necesary, farewell.
- Bye, Orbino.
- Farewell, Berta.
- What do you think about this?
- About what? - The land thing.
Does it mean the land is for all, and not ours in any case...
...or even that Coguazza, let's say, would be ours, Verginesi?
We've signed.
Mother, call the others too!
Yes! Berta!
Take this. You're also coming with me.
- Give me the harpoon. - Yes, mother.
- Watch out, you hyo. - Yes, alright.
Water's still raising,
Iook at the pole.
What did l tell you?
It's a big flood!
And that no-good Princivalle
Ieaving us alone in danger.
- Look!
- He's a miserrable one.
Let him go in Stamplinati's pigsty!
Rather than become a hog...
It was better if he wasn't born.- Mother, you shouldn't say such things. - What?!
The biggest are coming.
You always say the right things, but Princivalle is no longer a kid.
- Take a harpoon.
- What?!
At my age, you're teaching me what to say?
Careful there.
Mother!
Give me the harpoon, l'm here!
- Careful at that one.
- l'll pierce it like a pike.
Enough now. You know that once the first rush is over there's no danger anymore. l don't trust it, someone should stay guard this night.
- l'll do it, gladly.
- Berta, gas. - Yes, mother.
- Here. - Have you all eaten?
- Yes. - You can give mine away.
- l'm not very hungry.
- Eat in peace, take it.
Flod is the millers' Witch.
The night to cut the strings.
- Giovanni. - Antonio, you go.
- We'd better leave them be this time.
- In such a night?
- The new sergeant is a scoundrel!
- l know it, but we must take the chance.
- l've got a bad feeling.
Have you heard, mother? And I thought that bad feelings was gentlemen's stum.
- Go and take out the strings.
- Better not, mother.
- Better not!
- Why? Answer. l'll tell you why! There's something on your conscience that makes you a coward.
- Mother!
- You shut up!
Bad feelings? Look him in his face, this pig!
Say, rather, that when you go out with that Smarazzacucco spy...
...among those sows, you can't keep your mouth shut.
You've spilled out? And you're afraid they've gone to the sergeant. l only said not to take the strings of, why should l have spilled myself?
Because you're a simpleton, because anyone can trick you!
And l thought playing important with those gypsy women!
Shit! l've had enough living like shit!
- Ah, that's how it is?
- Yes, that's how it is!
Take the strings om, the mill must turn for us, not for the government.
Do you think l'm not afraid?
But had l given in, where would you be now?
Would you have paid the debts?
And now, Berta must get married, have you forgotten that?
Be careful, stupid. Come, go back!
Upstream again.
Jesus Christ!
Giovanni!
Mother! Mother!
The boat is here!
- l had said so!
- Shut up, animal!
Get the gun, it isn't the tax police, it's robbers.- What're you saying, mother?
- It's the tax police, mother, don't talk nonsense. - Help us, Holy Virgin!
Antonio, Giovanni, go meet them, and you put back the strings.
- There's no time.
- Shut up and put the strings back.
- Who's there?
- Tax police.
- You stay in the boat.
- Esposito, come with me. l'll try to retain him as much as possible.
- If you don't make it, burn everything with gas. - Eh? - Yes, yes.
This time they won't forgive us, it means prison. Go!
Where are the others?
Give it to me.
Bad night for strolling on the river, sergeant.
- Everyone with his cross, miller's wife.
- You want to come in? Do so.
But first l want to look at the counter. Hold this. lt's closed.
Bring me the key. l don't know where it is, sergeant.
How could you not know? Open it up!
Understood?
Open up! There's someone inside!
Open up!
Open up! It's burning!
There's a fire inside!
- Oh, Holy Virgin! Blessed Virgin, you protect him! - Away!
Save yourselves! It's burning!
You'll pay dearly this farce!
To the boat!
The wind makes puts everything on fire!
- Berta's trousseau!
Save yourself, mother, quickly!
- l'll break the roof.
- Berta, Antonio, move it!
Take everything to the boat!
Dosolina, come here!
Damn millers, they are burning alive!
Get on the ground!
Princivalle, for God's sake, save yourself!
To the bank!
There are flames everywhere.
No!
Come, quickly,
Iet's catch up with him!
Help!
You save him, O Lord!
Lord, punish me who have sent him.
San Míchele's burning! People, the mill is burning!
Look, they've saved them.
- Son! - Mother. - Take care.
- Hey! - No hands, eh?
Give him a coat.
Forgive me, mother, but the lit lamp fell on the gas.
You love us, Scansafrasca, take care of my mother.
Poor Berta...
We're ruined, if that doesn't suit you, you're free...- You know it's the same.
- l only have one word.
- Come, move it, let's go.
Don't doubt it, we all know how the misfortune happened...
...and we'll all come and testi_ for you.
- Come, come, get moving.
- Yes, sir.
Come, come, l'll show you the threshing machine. Come!
- Where does the grain come out?
- From there, and the straw from here.
- Eh, progress!
- What?
Progress. The ugliness of progress.
Did you know it's from England?
Can't compare it with doing it by hand!
- Danger! - It doesn't matter, l'm insured against fire.
- And the christians' life?
- What? Stop it, enough!
And what about the christians' life, if the barn catches fire?
The christians will be careful when we'll thresh.
And these are a senile's words! lt's been years since progressive people use machines.
Tonight l'll take the shot-gun and shoot this Devil's instrument.
- You'll take care of the machine.
- Yes, mister master.
Damn it, either for seeds or fertilizer, or for this, or for that...
...always the same resistence! lt's not beacuse they are bad, it's just that they're used the old way.
Of course this machine is a beautiful thing, very practical.
No, from these beloved Verginesi of yours there's nothing to be hoped for.
Yes, l make them obey me, but they hate me, but as soon as l turn the other way...
No, l need people... like you and like Berta Scacerni.
Tell me, how long has Berta been employed by you?
Since the mill has burnt.
Dosolina they've sent her at Bragana...
...and Berta was taken by my parents, to help her family out...
- How does she do on land?
Well? - Ah, very well!
My parents are very pleased, she works like a true peasant.
She's afraid of animals, of course, she's not used to them, but for the rest...
And what are you waiting to marry her? l'll make you administrator of the Ronco farm.
And when these beasts of relatives of yours will see the results...
...they'll either drop dead, or be convinced.
You'd take me and Berta as administrators?
The farm will be ready in one month, l have to put someone, don't l?
Better you than someone else. ln one month?
Had it been before the... l mean before the misfortune.
But now...
Princivalle is in jail, they haven't finished repairing the mill...
...and before we could talk about wedding...
...and before we could talk about wedding...
...and before we could talk about wedding...
Stubborn! What are you lacking, l'll take care of everything! l'll set you up, at the begining, then you'll pay me back!
- It's true, mister master.
- Talk with your folks, and with Berta...
Master! At St. George, we're having a holiday here, if you want to come...
We'd talk about everything!
Miste_ commendatore wanted to omend us.
The former owner never missed the
St. George holiday! And he had such fun!
Take this, go!
And mother? Antonio?
They haven't come.
You know mother, she doesn't want to be pitied by no one...
And Princivalle? lt seems he'll be out soon. Maybe when he'll be back the mill will be ready.
- Are we in a lot of debt?
- Eh...
- Clapasson, Fragana...
- How mush is he charging for the mill?
20 scudi!
- l'm alright. Everyone says l've put on weight! - l wouldn't say...
But l haven't thinned, have l?
And tell mother l have put on weight, she already didn't come ashamed l'm a servant!
Alright. And Orbino?
Hey, you forgot yourself?!
Wash the glasses! l've got work to do.
- Bye, Berta - Bye.
Are you still thinking about that? l'll talk to the boy if you can't.
There's no need. l can say these things.
Don't play the bumoon, grandpa, you may get sick!
- Come on! Have you heard? Wine!
- Music! Music!
Take it, please.
Orbino! What are you doing?
Maria, take it to the table.
- No, no
- Don'tworry! Come with me!
Look, see the miller!
No, l'm not going! l can't!
_ong live the bride and groom!
- Enough! Let me go! l've got work to do!
- l'll settle with a dance.
- Yours are not pleased, Orbino.
- But l'll marry you, Berta.
If you want, I'd marry you even tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
Clapasson puts us administrators in Ronco, us hyo, and takes care of everything.
My people oppose his omer, but l want to marry you, and l accept it.
Like this, you won't enter poor in my parents' house, but in your own.
- Blessed Virgin, Orbino, are we getting married?! - Sure.
Look at her, how cheeky she is!
Loook, look what a beautiful lover!
Kiss me also!
Yes, a kiss!
Just wait, now they'll kiss all over under our very eyes!
Come on!
Don't be afraid, it's only us!
- Are you afraid you'll blow up? - Anyway, you'll be married before nine months.
Are you crying? Why, Berta?
They were only joking!
Why are you crying?
It's only jokes! lt's because her secrets have been revealed.
She will not be able to allude to my mother, and sees her husband slip away.
Susanna, l don't want to be omended, or l'll give you a lesson you'll not forget.
Don't play the little saint, you were clever enough to get into Orbino's house...
...here, in the country, were you can fulfill all desires.
- Aren't you ashamed? - Don't make me
Iaugh, l thought you cleverer.
Come on, Orbino, do you also not know a joke when you see one?
Susanna is a merry girl, she hasn't said anything harmful, has she?
Come drink a glass ofwine with us, l want to speak to you.
Nobody has invited you to play judges even in our home.
You've understood perfectly what my sister has said.
However, be this good or wrong, it's not your business!
Why? They could very well be my business, even more...
- What's happening here?
- Nothing, mother, holiday jokes.
Susanna had one glas too many and... l was telling her not to make Orbino
Iose time and she wanted to hit me...
...after saving her from misery and hunger.
Shut your shameles mouth!
Berta knows how she must behave until things will have changed.
You have helped us, and don't worry that you'll have reasons to complain about me.
You're a reasonable girl, you know that now you must wait.
And you keep your antics to yourself.
And think about eating, or isn't this why you came for?
Let's take a few steps, we can talk better.
You know, Orbino, that l could be your father, don't you?
No, l don't need a nanny!
Hey, down there, have you fallen asleep?
Music! Music!
You stay here.
The Scacerni are your enemies and if you mary her, you'll be against us.
You'll be considered our enemy.
- Whose enemy?
- The League's. - l?!
The hell with it!
Come and hear this!
He has put it in his head to make and break matrimonies in our house.
Marry her... Stupid world!
Don't you want to understand l'm speaking for your good?
What will you do when her family will be boycotted, eh?
Can you guarantee that when mother and brother will come asking for help...
...you'll keep the door to your house closed?
And you say itjust like that?
It's a thing that makes your blood boil! lt's boycott! It's worse for them who have asked for it.
But war is war and we'll treat them as enemies. l've told you, who is not with us is against us.
And the power of the League must be seen here, where the blood boils.
Alright! You see this sign? l'm here, you're there!
Look into my eyes, yours is a cowardly and filthy abuse.
And l'll marry Berta. but we, Verginesi, are with the League.
What we don't do for us, we do it for our children.
And if not, for the children of our children.
- And l don't look into no one's eyes.
- Uncle Luca! lf the League doesn't want you to marry her, if they boycott you and your wife...
...even we, the family, we, your own blood, we'll boycott you.
May God have mercy of us.
- Tell the headman everything, yes?
- Alright.
Then, will you accept or not?
When you and l agree, the rest doesn't matter.
Yes, it doesn't, and after all, l've made the omer, didn't l? l like the girl...
...whatever you need, even the spade and bed, l'll provide them.
Thank you, mister master, l'll do my best.
Yours are also with Raibolini?
Have they signed?
- You should ask them.
- Correct, correct. l don't need these from you, l've got my snitches!
Good ones!
Good ones. l know everything. The old God-fearing gentlemen have signed.
But this is a camorra, a mafia, a mob.
And they're in, the Verginesi!
They rennounce their blood to support that good-for-notihng Raibolini.
Let them go to him looking for work; on my
Iand, no camorra, no mafia, no League.
Or out of the League, or out of Coguazza, l'll fire them, l'll drive them away.
- From where? - From Cataio, from
Bengodi, from Luna, from Coguazza!
Yes, l'll drive them away from Coguazza! l'll give them an ultimatum tomorrow, and the other owners will do the same.
You who can think, you can advise them.
There still is time.
Mister master, for us tenants, firing means ruin.
- The Verginesi have been in Coguazza for 300 years. - What's your problem?
What have you to fear?
You've got other ideas, you're a man.
You must think at your family.
You've got my word. In fact, you can already consider yourself married and settled. l'll give you an advance for the expenses.
That'll show l not only can punish, but also reward.
Here.
No. l only wanted to get married peacefully. l thought you had taken me because l know how to work.
But l see l haven't yet understood how this world moves along. l thank you, but if you're chasing the
Verginesi, that's what l tell you:
...l'll remain with my own.
Good day.
Good day.
Load and get back. And send immediately
Lazzaro with the other cart.
Tell them down there to stop scything, water doesn't crumble the grass.
All to loading!
Yes, it's alright!
Come, let's go home.
- You, the things in the hut.
- Yes, l'll take it.
He'll send us away.
He'll fire us.
He'll evict us from our fields!
Let's hope you don't bring hail.
Quickly, to the hut!
Berta! Come... Berta!
Come! It's over.
Come...
Please, don't look at me with those eyes, Berta.
- What happened?
- Lightning, but it's gone.
- Lightning?
- Yes. - Where? lt hit the scythes, but we're safe.
What is it, Berta?
Why are you crying?
- Don't! Why?
- l don't know... l don't know... l still feel it, at the back of my head.
O God! lt seems a bad omen. lt's a bad omen, we'll never begin our life!
- Why do you say that?
- l'm afraid!
Yes, it's true, all l had hoped, has crumbled.
Clapasson chases us. l don't know anything anymore:
...when will we get married, what will we do..
Everybody hates us and l love you to death!
And l can't live without you. lfyou'd see how l feel, you'd cry.
How beautiful you are!
How l sumer, not having you, do you know it? l don't know what to do, there's nothing in the world.
We'll emigrate, we'll go to America...
...l want you, l'll marry you!
No! lt's what l've been waiting for, and now it's begining.
The Verginesi will not leave Coguazza.
All for one, and one for all.
The owners don't want the League and we have only one weapon: the strike.
Nobody must work the land.
No one will harness the horses, nor yoke the oxen.
- Nobody will feed the animals.
- But the animals will die.
Let them die!
You're soldiers of social equality.
You can't have a war without casualties.
And without war, you won't have the land.
And nobody must let blacklegs into his home.
Nobody mustn't even talk to them, nothing! lf a blackleg gets sick there must be no help, no medicine.
- And not even the gravedigger to bury them. - Christian charity...
Christian charity is over.
Social justice begins.
Nobody must talk to blacklegs.
Nobody must let them into their houses.
Nor help them, nor medicine and not even the gravedigger to bury them.
Hey, della Favorita, l'm here!
Hi, Princivalle! lt mills! It mills again!
Mother!
Damn it!
Mother, Princivalle's here!
- Mother, l've come back, l'm here with you!
- O, damn!
- Princivalle!
To hell with them!
The wheel turns again!
Damn it! lt's over! It's over! l showed the judge with all his questions!
You did well that night.
You've never taught us to be afraid!
- And the strings, are you still taking them om?
- Yes. - Well done! Show the government.
- Oh, Princi, Princi!
- What did you learn in prison?
To speak a lot and say nothing.
- Is Berta still at the Verginesi?
- Yes. - And Dosolina and Antonio?
They all work, we'll need time to pay our debts.
Scacerni!
Raibolini said there's a strike.
You must stop your machines!
Woe whom works for the owners!
- Strike?
- And what's that got with us?
Who doesn't boycott the owners and Clapasson, is boycotted.
- The League's order!
- Have you all gone mad?
We can't give up working for
Clapassòn, it keeps us afloat.
Go give the League's orders to whom you want!
On our mill, we are the owners!
And we'll mill for whom we want and like! Got it?
Ah, you're blacklegs? Careful, no one will speak to you.
Your girls will have no work.
There will be no bread for you, nor help, and not even medicine.
Go away!
Princivalle, l've warned, the time of abuses is over.
Hey, you, no one must work the land!
Nobody must harness the horses, or yoke the oxen.
Hey! Hey, attention!
Do not move the boats!
Nobody must work on the river,
Raibolini's orders!
The strike of all workers has begun!
Hey! Starting today, all day labourers are on strike...
...defending the League!
Alright!
My dears... Giving up to the Verginesi...
Do you know what that means? lt means we ruin ourselves.
Not only mine, but all of us. lt means not being masters anymore in our own homes...
...rennounce to run our lands.
And then we'll be parasites...
...and we'll give leash to instigators to social subversion.
So, may all go to pieces, but l'll not give up.
And you also, eh?
You mustn't give up also.
Why don't you try to get along?
Violence can only give you back disasters and animosity.
But shouldn't we better go to the city waiting for the storm to pass?
Our place is here!
And all strategic moves for wining the battle are ready.
We'll reap our fields, mill our grain...
- Your order, sir.
- Ice and anisette. - Yes.
We'll labour them, we'll drive the carts...
- No!? You'll go yourself?
- If l have to, yes.
But until them... Iet's see.
Come, come, l was waiting you!
Tell me, are you afraid to mill for us?
- Afraid, l? - You know him all, don't you?
Princivalle Scacerni. l'm afraid of no one. My mill, mills for whom l chose.
Oh, bread is assured!
Here, smoke! Smoke!
And for urgent labours l've recruited day labourers from the other side of the Po.
- Here. - We can also work.
- Feed the animals.
Raibolini, the League and the Verginesi will go to the Devil!
What kind of people are you?
Damn it!
- Help me!
- Come, quickly, help me!
One, hyo, three, four, five
Five scudi! Damn it!
How nice!
- The hay was fermented?
- Silence...
They've killed them, they are dying.
They've given them fermented hay.
- Quickly, to the veterinary!
- We mustn't!
Nobody moves, nobody does anything.
Nobody touches it.
They're calling for me...
They call for help!
4 cows and 2 oxen are dead.
And we don't know about the others.
You should have died instead of the animals!
Letting them die without moving a finger!
They were not mine, but were like my children.
They should all die better than letting someone like you in the country.
You've done it on purpose! You've given them fermented hay.
- l don't speak with madmen!
- You'll speak to the police!
Tell the truth! You've changed the fodder in the manger. l should whip you!
Take it on me ifyou want to get crushed!
Go! Go! Go away!
You're not worth the skin of one of these animals.
You'll pay for it, l'll show you all.
- l'll show you!
- Do what you want.
We'll sumer, but we'll change things for our children.
Clapasson has brought soldiers for the reap.
- Goodbye strike, and now what will we do?
- Who knows? - Let's go and see. l'll close shop.
Blacklegs! Here they are, they've come!
You've sold yourselves!
- The soldiers are here!
- Let's go see!
- Shame!
- Oh-oh!
The soldiers are here, eh?
Am l boycotted?
Well done, league men!
Well done, league men!
Oh, see Orbino.
Ehi, Verginesi!
- Here you are! Or have you melted?
- Let me be, Princivalle.
You know l'm not afraud shaking your hand, in front of all, you're like a brother.
- What's this, Verginesi?
- Do you see the soldiers?
They're going to Coguazza to reap our wheat. It's over.
Bad for you to have messed in.
And Berta must not be caught in the middle!
And Berta must not be caught in the middle.
Understood? l don't know nothing anymore don't know what l'll do. l don't know who my friends or foes are, they're all my enemies!
Only one thing l do know: l love Berta and she loves me.
And l'll marry her!
Even if l have to leave my county.
Stop! Take the scythes and go in the fields.
- We've chosen peasants, able handed.
- Bravo, bravo.
Quickly with the scythes.
Look! Look!
Damn the cowardly bourgeois!
Nothing happens!
Nothing!
Bad thing! - Bad thing, lieutenant, Clapasson little does he know!
- Sclaves!
- Away! Sclaves!
- Enough! - Rascals!
- Disgusting rascals!
Jerks!
Traitors of the people!
Enough! Cowards!
Enough! Sclaves!
- Long live the League!
- Courage!
Lieutenant!
- In God's name!
- l've told you!
Back! Back!
Gather! Gather!
Let's do someting, let's take action.
We must inforce the law!
Calm and cold blood, commendatore, here l'm the law.
They are also citizens.
- What are you doing?
- l'm clearing the field. lmpossible...
- Let's try to tell them a few words...
- Yes, you talk.
You can't do this.
Those are soldiers, and l must inforce the law, you must leave.
You don't want to work? Alright, don't work, but it's not your grain.
- You'll have to kill us ifyou want to reap our grain! - Silence!
Lieutenent, be careful.
Attention, the trumpet will blare three times. lf at the third blare, you've not left the field, l'll command fire!
We're not moving.
Load arms!
Take aim!
Shoot us!
Shoot us! Shoot us!
Shoot, if you have the guts!
Make them go away.
No.
Stop! ln the air!
Fire!
Down arms!
Fall out, fall in on the embankment.
We've won!
Victory! Victory!
They are afraid, aren't they?
- Long live the League!
- Back!
They've arrested aunt Argia and Susanna.
They've taken them away.
They're all here. Uncle Luca is talking to the delegate.
- The soldiers? - They are in the town hall. l'll run forward.
Do you remember how close the wedding once seemed?
- Do we still love each other?
- For ever! Until death.
Free them!
And now, what do we do? l can't let them go.
Opposing public forces, outrage, violence...
- And how do we set them free?
- You can't put them in prison!
- The people are agitated, l'll not be held responsible. - Bravo!
There's ony one thing to do:
End the strike. l'll close my eyes as far as these
Iadies are concerned...
How could we end the strike?
Now that we've won?
Won what?
The grain will rot and then?
Two barns have burnt yesterday and now this.
Tomorrow there'll be blood, and civil war!
What can l say to these poor men?
Listen, you'll go in prison, and they'll close the League.
This men won't see their women for a good while.
The law suit, first... months and months...
Listen to what l advise you, in all honesty...
We've always been on your side.
You know it.
But we want our women home by this evening.
Here's the blackleg!
Set the women free!
Comrades, our women will be freed...
...but we must end the strike!
The strike must end!
Our time has not yet come.
Listen, comrades!
Listen!
Comrades...
Here she is, the blackleg!
- Look at her!
- Let me go, swindlers!
- Scoundrel!
- Who?
You'll pay this! l'm going back to the mill!
Cowards! Cowards!
- Berta! - You don't move, you don't rennounce your blood.
Let me go!
It's over now! l'm leaving! Berta!
Shame, Verginesi!
We've made the strike for you!
And now you're harboring the blackleg!
Down with the traitors!
Down!
All come with me!
All come with me!
Wait! Wait!
You'll achieve nothing! l'll come with you, l won't abandon you.
- Bless it, it's the flag of the poor.
- Yes, bless it. l bless you, poor people, because you'll not do harm. ln the name of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.
- Justice!
- Justice!
- Berta's here! Berta! What happened?
- What did they do to you?
Nothing. How are you?
- Mother! - How are you, my daughter?
What have they done to you?
Oh, nothing, it's only the shock. l'm so happy to be with you!
Have they chased you away?
Have they fired you also?
No, not they, Princivalle, not they!
Raibolini... because of the League.
They began shouting in the square!
Raibolini! This time you'll pay for everything.
Don't call me your son anymore...
...if this swine Raibolini sees the night with his head intact!
- Princivalle! - Princivalle!
- Princivalle! - Where're you going?
Come back
- Princivalle! Come back!
- Princivalle!
Raibolini, come outside!
Raibolini! Where are you? Come out!
Come out!
Where's he? Damn it!
Where's he?
Where's he?
Come out, damn it!
Out!
Out! League men!
Out!
Where's he?
Raibolini, come out!
Come out!
That cursed asshole! Where's he?
Stop, or you're dead!
You'll get me, eh?
Look how he's shaking!
Don't hurt me, Princivalle, l'm not to blame. lt wasn't me.
Let me go, you're sumocating me. lt was the Verginesi, they've chased her away in front of the entire county.
Let me go!
They've disgraced her!
- Orbino...
- Orbino what?
Orbino was laughing. He was pleased.
It was him, it was him...
- It's not true! - You can sumocate me, ifyou want, but l must tell you the truth. l don't want to, it makes me sick, but l have to tell you.
There's sometime he said he was bored, that she was worse that a bitch in heat.
There was no hedge or bush on the Po's bank she wasn't had in.
He was content the strike had given him the oppurtunity of getting rid of her.
Princivalle! What's the matter?
- What have you said about my sister?
- Princivalle, are yo drunk?
What have you said about the ditches, the bed? That she's filthy?
Coward! Defend yourself, defend yourself dog!
- l'll kill you!
- l've never said but good things!
Let me go! Let me go!
- My love for Berta...
- Don't say her name!
Up! Up!
Up, Orbino. l forgive you...
Tell Berta, she must not think like you... Tell her!
All my love for her...
Orbino, don't die...
Tell your sister.
On God, l swear it, Orbino.
Orbino!
Don't die, Orbino!
No, don't die!
Where's he?
- Where's he?
- No one will know l'm crossing the river, come with me. lf you tell me where's Orbino, l'll let you live. Answer!
The poor wretch... should l have left him here, to destroy us both?
- l did it more for you, than for me.
- Why?
When a misfortune happens here, you know it well, it always happens in the water.
What place? Where?
There.
What do you want to do?
Yes, the river's taking him away. l'm sure where he'll show up.
We should wait him there.
But he won't be happy.
- He said he forgave me. - The dead don't hate the ones that omended them.
He wants you when he'll appear, you that loved him.
Not even God could give me the strength to stand before Berta.
Come, l'll talk to the women.
He'll appear here, but not until morning.
Sit and say no christian prayers, that's what the river wants. lt appears.
You, Berta.
And you? l'm giving myself up, pray for me, mother.
Go, son!
''That's how come and go men's good and evil and time is just like a flowing river''
THE END
Snow all winter, cloudbursts all spring.
Food just about gone. There's nothing in the ground coming up.
If we stay here much longer. We'll starve.
They're always saying the same thing Tom, no matter where we go.
Pull up stakes and get gone, is all you think about.
We got nothing to worry about, Pa.
Rain don't last forever.
Even if it stopped, you wouldn't notice it.
Being as how you're everlasting got your nose stuck in some book.
What you reading now?
That book Squire Noble gave me back in Indiana.
It's called "Shakespeare".
What in the name of tarnation mockery is that?
Kind of poetry.
Poetry?
Hmm. My son.
Maybe, if he ever gets time to get himself an education ..
Maybe someday he'll write poetry.
Over my dead body, he will.
Well, it's settled.
We're all ready to go.
Go where?
- Didn't Abe tell you?
A boy named ..
Let me tell 'em, John.
You talk too slow.
There's a trader named Denton Offut ..
Wants me and John and Abe to take a flat boat of hogs down to New Orleans.
He wasn't sure we was the men for it. But we convinced him.
Good money?
- Twenty dollars a month. Apiece.
We're starting from a town called
Springfield up the Sangamon river.
When?
- Right now. Come on, Abe.
Yeah, if we don't hurry we lose the job.
Who'd have thunk anyone in this family would ever make twenty dollars a month.
So you're going, Abe?
I guess I'd better do it, Ma.
I know I can trust the old man to your care, Ma.
And we can trust you, Abe.
You're a good boy.
I couldn't have loved you more if you'd been my own son.
I'll always be thanking you Ma, for your great kindness to me.
Wherever you go, whatever you do.
You remember what the good book said:
"The world passeth."
"But he that doeth the will of God."
"Abideth forever."
I'll remember, Ma.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Dear Abe.
Last time I was down south they talked about an election in The United States.
I tell you these suckers here don't know their own head from an ax handle.
Why, I remember once when ..
- There's a town over there, Mr Offut.
Yeah. That's New Salem.
A right pretty little place.
Going to be bigger than
Springfield someday.
No, you don't. No, you don't.
I got all my rag money and savings wrapped up in you little squealers.
And I don't calculate to lose it in the Sangamon.
Keel her over, Abe.
Keel her over. Mill dam just ahead.
Keel her over, Abe. Keel her over!
Keel her over, boys. Keel her over.
I'm a keeling.
Never mind me. Get them pigs.
My name is Abe Lincoln.
And mine is Ann Rutledge.
I .. I don't know the name of the pig.
Well, where are you going with all those pigs?
New Orleans. If we don't hit any more mill dams on the way.
Do you live here, Miss Rutledge?
Yes.
I suppose it doesn't look like much to a travelled man like you.
It looks like a fine place to me.
Fine people.
If you think I like to travel, you're wrong.
I'm only doing it because
I got to. Same as the pig.
Hey!
Hey!
Oh .. I guess I got to be going.
Goodbye, Miss Rutledge.
I'm pleased to have made your acquaintance.
Goodbye, Mr Lincoln.
And good luck.
Looks like we got them all.
Nice people them people.
You know what.
As soon as I get back I'm going to open up a store in that town.
You think you'd like to work for me?
Abe?
Yes, sir?
- Did you hear me?
No, sir.
I said I'm going to open up a store in that town as soon as I get back.
Want to work for me?
- Yes, sir.
I sure do.
Al I know about Denton Offut.
I can bet you a coon-skin cap against your Sunday pants ..
He don't show up in
New Salem like he promised.
Well if he don't, he don't.
That's simple, ain't it.
You got another interest in New Salem?
- Nope. Don't know anybody.
Well .. nobody excepting
Ann Rutledge maybe.
You know her?
- Who don't.
Her Pa owns the tavern.
Where did you meet her?
I was with a pig. She spoke to me first.
They was pioneers in them days.
And we didn't have no luxuries to live on like you got today.
We didn't have no pickles and gravy and corn bread.
No sirree.
Prime salt pork was a
Sunday dish in them days.
What you eat on Saturdays, Ben? Beans?
What's happening?
- Election day. That's old Ben Mattling.
He makes the same speech every year.
But we didn't complain neither.
We pitched in to the revolutionary war.
We weren't no milksops like you are today.
If the country is going to the dogs.
Why don't you do something about it?
I'm talking to you like a soldier.
I have to plow this miserable country.
Didn't you get no assistance from Washington and Jefferson?
Shut up, Jack. Let him talk.
Now what I want to know is this.
How are you going to vote today?
We'll vote as we gosh-darned please, you old windbag.
Come on, boys. Let's go and get some liquor.
Who's going to pay for it, Jack?
- Who said anything about paying?
In the year 1776 ..
We stated the proposition that all men were created equal.
And now look at us.
You keep out here, you low scum, you.
You'll get no liquor from me today or any day until you learn to behave yourselves.
I believe I said we want liquor.
Did you hear me say it, Mr McNeil?
Now go easy, Armstrong.
We don't want any trouble here.
Oh? And what's more we won't have any trouble.
Don't fight with him, John.
No, John. Don't you fight with me.
If you want to keep your health.
Let him go I tell you.
Afraid I might do something to that pretty face of your future husband?
Never mind, Miss Annie.
I won't damage him.
If he is what you want, you can have him.
As you ain't hospitality to invite us,
I guess we might as well help ourselves.
Come on, boys.
The Cleary Grove boys are getting drunk. All of them.
They'll break up the whole tavern.
Can't anybody do anything?
Can't you speak to them, Judge?
I'm afraid Miss Ann, it wouldn't do a particle of good.
You're right, Judge.
Not a particle of good.
I tell you, you all ought to listen to what the judge said.
He's got a round belly but a level head.
Nobody can do nothing with me without licking me first.
If I was a might younger ..
Easy, Ben.
I'm the big buck of this lick.
And any of you want to whet your horns, all you got to do is ..
Give that hat a kick.
Don't you dare to worry, Trum.
Nobody will dare to damage it.
You want a fight, stranger?
Not particularly.
Well if you change your mind, there's the hat.
If I were a man, Jack Armstrong, I'd give you the thrashing you deserve.
Well you ain't a man Miss Annie and praise be for that.
You're a female and a pretty gosh-darned appealing one.
Can't you see I'm the only man there is in the measly town?
Leave go of me.
I've changed my mind.
Excuse me, Mister.
But it had to be done.
Better be careful, stranger.
You're up against the greatest fighter in this town.
Thank you, gentlemen.
But we've all got to learn sometime.
That's the spirit, Mr flop-ears.
Shake hands?
A pleasure.
That was quite a hardy handshake.
At least I admit it.
When I was a boy I didn't like molasses and sulphur either but I ..
Got so I could take it.
Want another?
Shouldn't be surprised.
Watch out for his dirty tricks.
Lick him stranger, and you'll be my friend for life.
That's it. That's it, go after him.
Are you satisfied?
I'm satisfied.
Also, I'm quite considerably surprised.
So am I.
It was an accident.
- You didn't fight fair.
Wrestle him again, Jack.
- No, sir.
No more wrestling with this long-legged son of vengeance.
I'm here to admit to one and all.
That New Salem has a new champion.
Congratulations.
Fine work.
That was good work, Mr Lincoln.
You're the man we've been waiting for in New Salem.
Thank you for remembering my name.
You've met before?
In a .. sort of informal way.
I hope you will be staying here.
- I hope so, Miss Rutledge.
Looks like we must delay the voting.
We haven't anyone to act as clerk yet.
Here you are, stranger.
- Oh, thank you.
What's your name?
- Lincoln.
Abraham Lincoln.
- My name is Joshua Speed.
Glad to meet you.
I'll introduce you to our leading citizens. Judge Bowling Green.
How do you do.
- Mr Mentor Graham, our schoolmaster.
Glad to meet all of you.
- Good afternoon.
Can you write?
I guess I can make a few hand tracks.
Good. Then you can help tabulate votes.
Give him the oath, Bowling.
- Raise your right hand.
Repeat after me.
I, Abraham Lincoln do solemnly swear to uphold the constitution of ..
Wait a minute, mister.
What are you getting me into?
We must put you to work for the government, Mr Lincoln.
Oh no you don't. I don't want to be no politician.
Nonsense.
All you're going to do is to see that we get an honest vote.
Come on now. Take the oath.
Go ahead, Mr Lincoln.
You're the only one those
Cleary Grove boys will respect.
Alright, mister ..?
Gale. Seth Gale.
Howdy.
The same to you.
I, Abraham Lincoln.
Do solemnly swear to uphold the constitution ..
Of The United States of America.
Of The United States of America.
Well, let's see now.
I've got my hickory shirt.
I got my pound of beans.
And give me a pair of buckskin gloves.
Ain't got no buckskin gloves but ..
These are dog's skin.
They only cost 75 cents.
They look good.
How do you know they are dog's skin?
- I'll tell you how I know.
Jack Cleary's dog kills
Tom Watkins' sheep.
Tom Watkins' boy kills the dog.
Old John Morris tans the dog's skin.
Sally Spears makes the gloves.
That's how I come to know they are dog's skin.
So that's how, is it.
Well, I'll take them.
But .. you'll have to trust me for the money.
If anybody ever offered us cash in this store we'd drop dead.
I'll remember that, Abe.
When I trade here again.
Abe.
I'm a restless man.
Got the soul of a gypsy.
I feel the urge to pull out of New Salem.
Why, I'm sorry ..
- I want to show my appreciation.
For the fine work you've done in my employ.
No thanks are necessary, Mr Offut.
I'm going to give you more than mere thanks, my friend.
I'm going to make you a present of this store.
Yes sir, Abe. It's all yours.
Lock, stock and barrel.
That's mighty generous of you, Mr Offut.
- Not a word, Abe. Not a word.
I'm making this gesture solely because that's the way I am.
Goodnight, Abe.
- But Mr Offut ..
There is one thing that I hope you'll excuse me to mention.
Just how much money do you owe here?
I knew you was a smart man, Abe.
Yes, sir. I've always been a shrewd judge of character.
With your brain and energy you'll make a go of this store.
And it won't take you long to pay of the sum of $1,500.
Goodnight.
Evening, Abe.
Evening, Mentor.
Let's see. Where were we when we left off?
You said at this lesson we'd review the "moods".
Ah yes, the moods.
Every one of us has many moods.
You yourself have more than your share, Abe.
They express the various aspects.
Now.
Name me the five moods.
Abe.
Excuse me, Mentor.
I asked you to name me the five moods.
Oh.
The indicative, the imperative ..
Potential, subjunctive and infinitive.
And what do they signify?
- The indicative mood is the easy one.
That just indicates a thing like
"he loved" or "he is loved".
The imperative mood is used for commanding, like ..
"Get out and be danged doing it".
Is that the best example you can think of?
Well you can put it in the bible:
"Wait until I go Thou in peace" but it is still imperative.
And the potential?
Well, that just signifies possibility.
Usually of an unpleasant nature like ..
"If I ever get out of debt, I'll probably get right back in again."
Debts keep piling up on you, Abe?
I'm afraid it's my own fault.
I'm my father's son.
Give me a good steady job and I'll fail at it.
You haven't been a failure, Abe.
There's not a man-jack in this community ..
That isn't fond of you and anxious to see you get ahead.
I know it just like you, Mentor.
Sitting up nights to give me learning just out of the kindness of you heart.
And now Judge Green and Josh Speed.
And a few others I owe money to want to get me the job of postman.
Thinking maybe I can handle that seeing as there's only one mail comes a week.
Well, Abe.
There are always two occupations open to those who've failed at everything else.
There is school teaching and politics.
I'll take school teaching. You go into politics and you may get elected ..
And then you got to go to the city and I don't want none of that.
What did I say about too negative?
- I meant any off that.
What's your objection to the cities, Abe?
You ever seen one?
Sure.
I've been down river to New Orleans.
You know every minute of the time I was there, I was scared.
I was scared of people.
Did you imagine that they would rob you of all your gold and your jewels?
No.
I was scared they'd kill me.
Why?
Why should they want to kill you?
I don't know.
You are a hopeless mess of inconsistencies, Abe Lincoln.
You understand, don't you, Ann?
How long will you be gone, John?
About 2-3 months. That's all.
I'll miss you.
Every minute of the time.
This was my mother's.
My father gave it to her when they became engaged.
All you must ever think about.
All I'll ever think about is that I love you.
We are going to be wonderfully happy.
Tell me that again.
Tell me we're going to be happy.
Hey, Abe. Have you seen this?
The governor is calling for a troop of volunteers right here in New Salem.
You'll be going won’t you, Abe?
I don't know.
It seems to me as if those Indians had a right to their own land.
Yes, but if want to settle in
Kansas-Nebraska territory ..
And live in peace out there we've got to fight the Indians first.
Just the way your own father did when he moved into Kentucky.
What is it, Jack?
We're all going to war, Abe.
And we've elected you Captain.
It looks as if they've made up my mind for me.
Squad right wheel, march!
Squad right wheel, march!
Left .. left .. left, right, left.
And they are known as Captain
Abraham Lincoln's company ..
Of the 1st Regiment of the
Brigade of mounted volunteers.
Yeah .. mounted volunteers.
I'd hate to be a horse and have one of them galoots ride me.
March!
Jack .. I've forgotten the command that will take 'em through the gate end-wise.
Don't ask me, sir. I'm only a Sergeant.
Company, halt!
The Company will break ranks and form again on the other side of the gate.
Hey, Abe .. look!
Anything for me, Abe?
Yes, Seth. There is one from
Maryland. Probably from your folks.
28 cents due.
- Thanks, Abe.
I'll pay you later.
- Any time, Seth.
Anything for the Rutledge family this morning?
There is one for your Pa.
Looks like a liquor advertisement.
One from New York State for you.
There is 34 cents due on it too.
I haven't got my purse with me.
That's alright, Miss Ann.
The government can wait.
Thank you, Abe. Very much.
Good morning, Miss Ann.
My, you're looking prettier every day.
Good news, I hope.
Very good, thank you.
Ha! Catch me waiting two years for any man.
I beg your pardon, Miss. Can you
Direct me to the home of Joshua Speed?
Yes, it's the house up there with the morning glories.
I think you'll find him at the tavern.
- Thank you, Miss. I'm much obliged.
Abe. Next to my old man, I think you're the homeliest critter I ever saw.
There is a reason, Mrs Garn.
When I was two months old I was the handsomest child in Kentucky.
My nurse swapped me off for another one that was kind of plain looking.
Hey, Abe.
They wants you over to the tavern.
Who does?
Josh Speed and Bowling
Green and one of them ..
Dressed up fellows from Springfield.
What do they want of me?
- I don't know.
But I can tell you this.
I don't like the looks of it.
But he's the best-liked man in this district.
The very man we want.
Maybe it will correct the public belief that ..
The Whig party is composed only of the more privileged classes.
Gentlemen.
Abe, I want you to meet
Mr Ninian Edwards.
A mighty important member of our political party.
Happy to know you, Mr Edwards.
- Mr Lincoln, it is a pleasure.
Sit down, Abe. We want to talk to you.
Abe, how would you like to run for the State Legislature?
When?
- Now.
For election in the fall.
- Why?
The Whig party needs a candidate from this district.
You are the postmaster here which gives you valuable contacts.
By delivering mail you can also deliver speeches and campaign literature.
With which our headquarters will keep you supplied.
Could you supply me with a suit and a store of clothes?
Your candidate mustn't look too plain.
And what's more Abe, in the legislature you get paid.
Three whole dollars a day.
Fine money alright. No denying that.
I see what you're getting at, Bowling.
I owe you a considerable sum.
I'm not thinking about the debts, Abe.
I know you ain't, Bowling. But I got to.
I can see Mr Lincoln, that you're the type of man who can handle anyone.
Hmm, even the Cleary Grove boys.
Oh, I can handle them because
I can out-wrestle them.
But you can't go around Sangamon
County throwing all the voters.
You want to get an education, don't you, Abe.
Well here is your chance to do it.
In Vandalia you'll be associating with all the finest lawyers in this State.
Important men like Stephen A. Douglas.
You'll grow.
I thought I'd growed too much already.
Don't listen to 'em, Abe.
Don't let 'em get you in politics.
They'll corrupt you the same as they corrupt the whole danged United States.
You are an honest man, Abe Lincoln.
You're a good-for-nothing ..
Debt-ridden loafer.
But you're an honest man.
Is that all you have to say, uncle Ben?
That's all. And I hope it's enough.
I kinda agree with him.
Well Mr Lincoln, we don't demand your answer immediately.
Think it over.
Now gentlemen, if you'll excuse me.
I have to put in an appearance at the torch light procession ..
In Springfield this evening so I must be moving along.
Just consider what it means.
To be starting up the ladder in a nation which is expanding south through Texas.
And westward to the empire of the Californias.
It is opportunity, Mr Lincoln.
Opportunity unlimited in scope.
Goodbye, sir.
Goodbye, Mr Edwards.
A pleasant journey to you.
Goodbye, gentlemen.
- Goodbye, Ninian.
Ann.
What is it?
That letter you got from New York State.
What do you know about that letter?
Well, I'm the postman.
I guess I know more than I ought to about people's private affairs.
But I couldn't help seeing that was the handwriting of Mr McNeil.
Whatever the letter said it is no concern of yours.
I know that but it makes me sad to think that something could have hurt you.
If I could help you, Ann ..
You know.
When you're distressed about something ..
It's a comfort sometimes even to have a pair of ears to pour your troubles into.
My ears are big enough to hold a lot.
You are a Christian gentleman, Abe Lincoln.
No, I ain't. I'm a common sucker with a shirt-tail so short I can't sit on it.
You can always something to make a person laugh, can't you.
I don't need to say anything, a person just has to look at me.
You were right about the letter, Abe.
Tom says he doesn't know when he'll be able to get back to New Salem.
By which, he probably means ..
Never.
I wouldn't say that, Ann.
I would.
Do you love him so much?
I thought I did.
But I guess I couldn't really love anyone who was as ..
Faithless as that.
You see.
I can't help thinking what they're saying about me.
All the old gossips all over town.
Oh, just weakness, I guess.
Vanity.
Something you couldn't understand, Abe.
Maybe I can understand it, Ann.
I got a kind of vanity myself.
I guess it's ..
Nothing but vanity that's kept me from declaring my inclination towards you.
I don't like to be sniggered at either.
I know what I am and what I look like.
I know I've got nothing to offer any girl I could be in love with.
Are you saying you're in love with me, Abe?
Yes.
I am saying that.
I've been loving you for a long time with all my heart.
You see Ann, you're a particularly fine girl.
But .. I don't want to worry you about it.
I only thought if you'd do me the honor to keep company with me for a while ..
It might shut the old gossip's mouths.
They'd figure you'd chucked
McNeil for someone else.
Even me.
Do you think I was too forward in speaking out as I did?
No, Abe.
I've always thought a lot of you.
The way I thought you were.
But the idea of love between you and me ..
I can't say how I feel about that.
But I can tell you this much now.
And truthfully.
If I ever do love you.
I'll be happy about it.
And lucky to loving a good, decent man.
You will .. just give me a little time to think about it.
You mean if you took time you might get in your heart ..
Something like the feeling I have for you?
I don't know, Abe.
But I do know.
You are a man who could fill anyone's heart.
Yes. Fill it.
And warm it.
And make it glad to be living.
What's the matter with you, Abe?
You the guest of honor. Not dancing.
I'd like to, but my feet won't work right.
Ann Rutledge sure is acting gay as she knows.
She is just trying to hide the misery in her heart.
They tell me that locket is the one John McNeil gave her.
She ought to forget him, I say.
I reckon she wishes she could.
Get some water, Abe.
She's alright, Doc. The excitement was just a little too much for her.
Here's the water, Doc.
Thanks, Abe.
She's be alright, Doc?
Oh, I don't think there's need for any worry.
Better be getting her on home.
It's alright, Ann.
I don't know what happened.
I'm alright, Abe.
I feel fine now.
Ain't you noticed whether she's been ailing any lately?
Well, she seemed kind of droopy, but we didn't think much of it.
Why, do you think she's took sick?
Oh, there is no cause for alarm, but ..
Just to be on the safe side,
I'll ride back with you.
I was scared.
You needn't be, Abe.
I'm sorry I made such a fool of myself.
You mustn't think of anything but winning that election.
You've got to win, Abe.
I'll be cheering for you when you do.
Goodnight, Abe.
Thanks.
Goodnight, Ann.
Goodnight, Abe.
Down in Kentucky where I was born was pretty wild country.
And wild people in it.
I heard tell of a ..
Woman who opened her door one day to see her husband grappling a fierce bear.
It was a fight to the death and the bear was winning.
The struggling husband cried to his wife: for heaven's sake do something.
The wife asked: "What could she do?".
Said the husband: "You could at least say something encouraging".
But the wife not wishing to take sides in this combat hollered:
"Go it, husband. Go it bear."
Now that's the way I'll be if elected.
I'll be like the man's wife.
I'll cheer for everybody so I'm sure to be on the winning side.
Where are you going, Abe?
Come on, let's finish with the voting.
We can't be all night about this.
What does the doctor say, Jack?
It's a brain fever, Abe.
She's pretty bad.
Thank you, Jack.
Who are you voting for?
- I'm voting for Abe Lincoln.
That's good.
Who you voting for, Trum?
For Abe.
Who?
I said I'm voting for Mr Lincoln.
You'd better.
Therefore, his sister said unto him.
Saying: "Lord behold".
"He who now lovest is sacred."
"When Jesus heart that."
"He said."
"This sickness is not unto death."
"But for the glory of God."
"That the Son of God might be glorified thereby."
You have come to me.
When I wanted you so much.
Come close to me.
Tell me we will be happy.
We're going to be happy, Ann.
I know I've got less than nothing to offer you.
But whatever I am.
Whatever I can be.
My life belongs to you and it always will until the day I die.
I love you.
Oh, I do love you.
I knew you would come back to me.
Don't ever go away from me again.
We will be happy.
Abe carried New Salem by 205 votes to 3.
My boys are out trying to find the 3 skunks who voted wrong.
Get her tight, Fergus.
Higher up Bob so we can see her.
No you don't.
I don't wear no soup kettle for nobody.
You ain't no better than Abe
Lincoln and he's wearing one.
Alright boys, here we go!
Down to Judge Green's house to pick up the new legislator.
They are coming, Abe.
"A large mass meeting in Boston Massachusetts."
"Many orators paid tribute to the heroic memory of the late Elijah Lovejoy."
"Thousands of New Englanders shouted .."
"He shall be avenged."
I wonder what the great Stephen A.
Douglas has got to say to that.
The great Stephen A. Douglas has this much to say.
Freedom of the press is all very well until liberty becomes licensed.
Lovejoy's life would have been spared if he'd listened to the dictates of reason.
Instead of his own rip-roaring fanaticism.
But ..
Perhaps my good friend
Abe Lincoln doesn't agree?
I agree that Lovejoy should have listened to reason.
If he had to be silenced I'd have preferred it had been done by the law.
Instead of a crowd of bloodthirsty killers.
Still straddling the fence, eh?
That won't help you to get re-elected.
I'm afraid nothing can help me.
I'm not running.
You are quitting the legislature?
- Yep.
Why Abe, I'm distressed. We'll miss you.
Sorry to cause you distress, Steve.
What will you do, Abe?
Judge Stuart has offered me a chance to work in his law office in Springfield.
Of course, I don't know much about the law.
But there is one thing I've learned here in politics. That is ..
Ignorance is no obstacle to advancement.
In fact, in some cases it's quite an advantage.
Good day everybody.
Hello Billy Herndon.
- Hello.
Hello Billy.
Nice day isn't it, Mr Herndon.
Why, yes it is.
Where have you been, Billy?
I had to go downstairs about that writ in the Wilcox case.
If you only went downstairs, why'd you wear your hat?
As a matter of fact I stopped in at the Chenery House saloon.
Careful, Billy.
You got great fires in you but you're putting them out fast.
Yes, sir.
I saw Ninian Edwards, sir.
He invited you to his party this evening.
It's getting quite a habit with him.
What's the occasion this time?
He wants you to meet his sister-in-law
Mary Todd, who's arrived from Kentucky.
You don't say so. Well, I am becoming a social success.
Yes, Mr Lincoln. You are.
And I'm afraid you enjoy it.
The Todd family are mighty high class people.
They spell their name with two "D"s.
Which is pretty impressive when you consider one was enough for God.
Good evening, Mrs Edwards. How stunning you look in that magnificent new gown.
A dress like that must have come all the way from Cincinnati.
My sister brought it from Louisville.
A present from my dear Papa.
Good evening, Steve.
- Ninian.
Mary my dear, may I present our most eloquent citizen Mr Stephen Douglas.
Mr Douglas, I am honored.
- Miss Todd.
Your brother-in-law has just now described me as eloquent.
But alas I must now prove him wrong.
Standing as I am in the presence of a penetrating intelligence.
Such devastating charm,
I am rendered speechless.
I can hardly believe it.
Ninian, I thought you were going to have that thing raised up.
It wouldn't make a difference if he had.
He'd have knocked over something else.
Mr Lincoln is more at home in the backwoods than in the drawing room.
How do you do, Mr Lincoln.
Well so far, I haven't been doing so well, thank you.
Never mind, Mr Lincoln.
I'm sure the other gentlemen envy you being tall enough to hit the chandelier.
Miss Todd, I want you to know that I resent that bitterly.
Hello Abe.
- Evening, Steve.
Still got the same old coat, Abe?
Got kind of attached to it.
- Seems a little short.
It will be longer before I get another.
Abe is what you might call a self-made man.
Well, I guess my parents ought to take some of the blame.
When I first knew him he was behind the counter selling whiskey and rum.
And intoxicating the customers with his own raw humor.
You see Miss Todd, I was always behind the bar and ..
Steve Douglas was always in front of it.
Something tells me I shouldn't have started this.
So I said to Daniel Webster.
You may stand where you like in Massachusetts.
But you'll meet your downfall out here in Illinois.
I can understand why they speak of you as the little giant.
Better be careful, Stephen.
Mary is just as ambitious as you are.
My sister has made no secret of the fact ..
That the man she marries will be
President of The United States.
Well I'm delighted to hear it, Miss Todd.
I've been looking for the perfect First
Lady as my consort in the White House.
And now I've found her.
Really? But you should give that out to the newspapers.
"Stephen A. Douglas consents to become President."
I ..
Seem to need a little more refreshment.
You are very sweet.
Well, one night there was a gathering of all the grandees.
You know, one of these high-toned shindigs.
All the girls in town were there and the handsome widows ..
And married women finicking about trying to look like girls.
They were all tied together in the middle and popped out both ends.
Like bundles of fodder waiting to be stacked.
And wanting stacking pretty bad.
And I'm hauling ..
Well it started out to be a political story.
And quite amusing too.
Don't you think, gentlemen.
But I think it is my turn to monopolise you for a while.
Has Mary taken leave of her senses?
Devoting herself to that Mr Lincoln.
When we have most eligible gentlemen here to meet her.
Perhaps Abe amuses her, my dear.
My sister is a well-bred young lady.
No.
No, Mr Lincoln. I'm not laughing at you.
I'm sure your mother must have been a wonderful woman.
How old were you when she died?
I was seven.
The milk-sick got her. Poor creature.
I helped Pa make the coffin. Whittled the pegs with my own jack-knife.
We buried her in a timber clearing beside my grandmother.
I used to go there often to look at the place.
I used to watch the deer running over her grave with their little feet.
I never could kill a deer after that.
Once I ..
Got a licking from Pa because when he aimed at a deer I knocked his gun up.
This is no way to behave in society.
Taking about the backwoods I come from.
It is just the way to behave, Mr Lincoln.
Please tell me some more about the lickings you got.
[ Singing: ]
"What has caused this great commotion? Motion, motion."
"Our country through .."
Notice the name, Billy?
Here. Right down at the bottom.
Boasting, huh?
Bowling!
How are you, Bowling?
- Sorry we're late, but glad to see you.
Glad to see you. This is Billy Hernden.
Squire Green from New Salem.
Proud to know you, sir.
Mr Lincoln speaks of you constantly.
Thank you, Mr Hernden.
Are you a lawyer too?
- I hope to be, sir.
I am serving here as clerk in Judge Stuart's absence.
So now you're teaching others, Abe?
- No, just setting a bad example.
How is that blessed wife of yours?
- Nancy is as busy as ever.
An more than ever concerned about your innermost hopes and yearnings.
You can tell her I'm becoming a person of importance.
Yes sir. If old Tippecanoe wins next fall ..
I'll be a member of the electoral college.
Is that the best you can do?
You and Billy should get better acquainted.
He's pretty disgusted with me too.
Says I've no ambition.
I associate with the wrong kind of people.
He can't stand a man who keeps his mouth shut and abides by the constitution.
If he had his way the whole
Union would be set on fire.
And we'd all be burnt to a crisp. Eh, Billy?
Yes, Mr Lincoln.
If you'll permit me to say so.
I think you'd be more use to your fellow men ..
If you allowed some of the same incendiary impulses to come out in you.
You hear that, Bowling?
I'm surprised at you, Abe.
I thought you were opposed to slavery.
I am opposed to slavery.
But I'm even more opposed to getting myself into trouble.
Why don't you run for Congress, Abe?
- If I did I might get elected.
I'd be in Washington.
Then I might have to cast my vote on the terrible issues of war or peace.
And what attitude would I take?
The "liberal" attitude of course.
And what is the "liberal" attitude?
To go to war for a tract of land or a moral principle ..
Or to avoid war at all costs.
No sir, Bowling.
I'm no fighting man. I found that out when I went through the Blackhawk war.
And was terrified I might to have fire a shot at an Indian.
Fortunately, the Indians felt the same way, so I never saw any of them.
Excuse me, Bowling.
That's his trouble. Women.
Well I should say that's the .. liberal attitude.
I cannot and will not stand it any longer.
All this ridiculous gossip must be silenced.
Well after all, the gossip does none of us any harm, my dear.
I ask you to keep out of this, Ninian.
This is between my sister and myself.
Nevertheless, Ninian is right.
I ask you to deny once and for all that you've ever given one moment's thought.
To the idea of marriage with Abraham Lincoln.
Oh, but I have. I've given many months thought to it.
And I've decided that I shall be "Mrs Lincoln."
Mary!
Does it shock you so deeply, Elisabeth?
And why not?
Marrying him would mean life in a log cabin.
With no servants, no decent clothes.
You expect me to do precisely what you've done.
Marry a rich well-bred gentleman like
Ninian. Live in a fine house like this.
A house with a fence around it to keep out the common herd.
And also to prevent you from escaping from your own narrow life.
Well, with all due respect to my dear brother-in-law.
I don't want that and
I won't have it. Never.
In Abraham Lincoln I see a man who would split rails for other men's fences.
But who will never build one around himself.
You talk with a kind of irresponsibility that's not far from sheer madness.
You've never made a move to change your condition or to improve it.
You consider that it couldn't be improved.
To you all this represents perfection.
Well it doesn't to me.
I want a chance to shape a new life for myself and for my husband.
Is that irresponsibility?
How far will you go with a man like that? Lazy and shiftless.
Forever stopping along the way to tell jokes.
He will not stop if I am strong enough to make him go on.
And I am strong.
I'll admit he seems to have no conception of his own power.
Or if he has, he's afraid to face it.
I'm not afraid.
I'm ready to fight to make him fulfil his destiny.
Even if you and all your world despise me for it.
Ah, merely a small point Mary, but ..
I suppose you've communicated your decision to Abe?
Not yet.
But when he comes this evening and he should be here at any moment.
He will ask for my hand in marriage.
After I've displayed the appropriate amount of ..
Surprise and confusion.
I shall murmur timidly: Yes.
Oh, this is positively humiliating.
Mr Lincoln, ma'am.
Tell Mr Lincoln that ..
I shall see him.
Show him in.
Will you step in, Mr Lincoln.
Thank you, ma'am.
Good evening, Mrs Edwards.
Evening, Miss Todd.
Ninian, good evening.
Good evening.
- Good evening.
Glad to see you, Abe.
And now if you'll excuse us.
Elisabeth and I must hear the children's prayers and see them safely abed.
I'd like to hear their prayers, too.
Oh no. You'd only keep them awake with your stories.
Come along, Elisabeth.
- Well, kiss them goodnight for me.
Mary.
Won't you come with us to say goodnight?
No, no my dear. Leave Mary here to keep Abe entertained.
I don't blame Ninian for keeping you away from those children.
They certainly adore you.
You understand them.
That is the important thing.
But do sit down, Mr Lincoln.
Here. By me.
Thank you.
I will.
Happy new year, gentlemen!
Happy new year!
She's exactly like that, Billy.
Whatever Abe lacks, she'll make up for.
She has drive and perseverance.
She'll make him fulfil his destiny.
I'm glad to hear that, Mr Edwards.
Here is to your health, sir.
- To yours.
Happy new year.
How are you, Steve? Happy new year.
Happy new year and give me a drink quickly, my host.
That is spiced rum-punch or eggnog, Mr Douglas?
I'll have a glass of some of each and then I'll make up my mind.
Well Ninian, where is the lucky bridegroom?
Abe? He wouldn't come here.
Seems to be in one of his gloomy moods.
Ah, just nervousness I expect.
- Everything is ready for the ceremony.
Elisabeth prepared a bang-up supper and the whole affair will go off handsomely.
You will be there of course?
- Ah yes. I am good sportsman.
I'll swallow my mortification.
And that's not all I'll swallow.
To begin with.
I ask you to join me in a toast gentlemen.
To the fairest flower of all
Kentucky. Miss Mary Todd.
Who from this day on.
Will be Mrs Abraham Lincoln.
To Mary Todd!
Happy new year, Mr Lincoln.
Mr Speed.
Happy new year to you, Billy.
I've just been over to the Chenery House.
They are all drinking toasts to your happiness.
I wish to have a private toast of my own.
Mr Lincoln .. when first I heard of your approaching marriage ..
I confess I was afraid you were lowering yourself.
Trading your honor for exalted family connection.
I apologise for so thinking.
I now believe that Miss Todd's ambitions for you are the same as my own.
I believe that she will never stop driving and goading you ..
Until you have reached the heights where you belong.
I say God bless her and give her strength.
And I drink to her.
And to her husband, the future
President of The United States.
Put that away.
Billy, I have a letter
I wish you to deliver.
A letter?
To whom?
You do it, Jack.
You had no right to do that!
- Maybe not.
But it's done.
And don't look at me as though you were planning to break my neck.
I knew you could do it, Abe.
But you won't.
Mr Lincoln asked me to deliver a letter to Miss Todd, but I refused to do so.
He was writing her to ask for his release ..
From a marriage which would only lead to endless pain and misery for them both.
If that isn't the truth, what is?
And if that is the truth, tell her so to her face.
In the manner of a man.
I'd have to tell her that I have hatred for her infernal ambition.
That I don't want to be ridden and driven onward and upward through life ..
With her whip lashing me and her spurs digging in to me.
If her poor small soul craves importance in life, let her marry Stephen Douglas.
He's ambitious, too.
I want only to be left alone.
It would be more gracious to admit that you are afraid of her.
Good for you, Mr Speed.
- You'd better keep out of this.
No, I won't.
You are not abandoning Miss Mary Todd.
No, you are only using her as the living sacrifice.
Offering her up hoping you're forgiven for your failure to do your own duty.
What "great duty"?
Everyone feels called upon to remind me of it and no-one can tell me what it is.
I can tell you.
I can tell you what is the duty of every man who calls himself an American.
It is to perpetuate those truths that were once held to be self-evident.
That all men are created equal ..
And endowed with the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
Are those rights denied to me?
Could you ever enjoy them while you realise ..
That two million of your fellow beings in this country are slaves?
When you look at that flag don't you ever realise ..
That ten of its stars represent States that would destroy the Union ..
Rather than give up their property rights on those slaves?
Don't dare tell me that anybody in this world knows it more than you Mr Lincoln.
You, who honor the memory of Elijah Lovejoy.
And every other man who ever died fighting in the defence of freedom.
I honor them.
And envy them.
Because they could believe that their ideals are worth dying for.
Alright, Josh.
I'll go up now and I'll take to Mary.
Then I'm going away.
Where, Abe?
I don't know.
[ Abe's mother: ]
"The world passeth."
"But he that doeth the will of God, abideth forever."
Howdy, Abe.
Hello, Abe.
Well, well, Mr Lincoln.
Glad to see you back.
Thank you.
Why Abe, when did you get back?
How do you do.
- Good afternoon.
After his shameful treatment of Miss Todd ..
I wouldn't think he'd dare show his face in this town.
And going in the Edwards' home of all things.
Right in where he's least wanted.
Well, we can't say he lacks courage.
Please come right in, Mr Lincoln.
Glad to see you again, Abe.
- Thank you, Mary.
You may well wonder why I thrust myself on your mercy in this matter.
I'm sure you're always welcome in Ninian's house.
After my behaviour at our last meeting I haven't been welcome company for myself.
Joshua Speed has kept us informed of your whereabouts.
We've been greatly concerned.
- You've been most kind.
Now you return to your work and no doubt you will run for the assembly again.
Or ..
Perhaps you have larger plans?
- I have no plans.
I only wish to gain your forgiveness.
There is no question of that.
What happened between us was my own fault.
I was blinded by my own self-confidence.
I ..
I loved you.
I believed that I could make you love me.
I believed that the fire of my ambition would burn in you.
You would become a man. A leader of men.
But.
You didn't wish that.
It is true Mary you once had faith in me which I was far from deserving.
The time has come when I wish to strive to deserve it.
I believe now that our destinies are together.
For better or for worse.
So I again presume to ask you to be my wife.
I fully realize that taking me back involves humiliation for you.
I've had humiliation already and survived it.
But I promise you, Mary.
If you will have me ..
I shall devote myself for the rest of my days to trying to do what is right.
As God gives me power to see what is right.
Then.
I shall be your wife.
I shall fight by your side until death do us part.
Abe .. I love you.
Oh, I love you.
Whatever becomes of the two of us, I'll die loving you.
Slaves.
Whether emancipated or not.
They yet remain subject to the authority of the dominant race.
And have no rights or privileges ..
But such as those who hold the power of government ..
Might choose to grant them.
Are you John Brown?
I am, sir. So what if I am John Brown?
Don't try and fight them anymore.
I place you under arrest for treason.
For bearing arms against the government of The United States.
I'd like to ask who is making this arrest.
I am Lieutenant-Colonel
Robert E. Lee of the 2nd Cavalry.
Acting under orders from President Buchanan.
It’s no use, Pa.
You've got to give in to 'em.
Somebody else ..
Got to finish this job.
Very well, Colonel Lee.
I submit to arrest.
Knowing full well I shall be hanged for this attempt to end the evil of slavery.
But after I am dead the evil will remain.
And you and all other patriots will come to learn ..
It can be purged from this guilty world ..
Only with blood.
Goodbye, my son.
Another fanatic has gone to meet his maker.
Why can't these anti-slavery fools mind their own business.
Senator Douglas!
The message you've been waiting for.
A telegram from Springfield.
They've nominated Abraham Lincoln to run against the senator this fall.
My heartiest congratulations.
Lincoln? Who's he?
What are they doing?
Giving you the election?
So Abe Lincoln has decided at last to come out and fight.
The best thing that could happen to us.
How does this Lincoln stand on slavery?
Nobody knows.
Least of all, Lincoln himself.
He's the most undecided, hesitating-est critter you ever saw.
We don't want that slave issue brought up in Illinois this year.
You can count on old Abe.
He's just what we want.
A peaceful man.
We'll start the campaign at once.
I will return to Springfield. I want an unprecedented welcome when I get there.
A brass band at the station.
A big parade.
And free liquor for all.
You don't mean to say that you're afraid of Abe Lincoln?
Why, the country doesn't know him.
Maybe the country doesn't.
But I do.
All ready now.
Keep very still.
One.
Two.
Three.
Tad, you are to keep absolutely still.
You too, Willy.
We will, Ma.
Now please, one and all.
One.
Two.
Three.
Tad!
If I have to speak to you once more ..
But Pa keeps tickling me.
I might have known it.
Please, Mr Lincoln.
Please bear in mind this picture was ordered by the Chicago Tribune.
To spread far and wide during your campaign.
I'm sorry, Mary. But I can't help thinking how foolish I look.
Now I beg of you, no movement of any kind.
This time we'll get it.
One.
Willy .. Tad.
Come back here.
Look, Pa. It's a great big parade.
Douglas has arrived.
Listen to them cheering for him.
They ought to cheer him.
He paid them enough for it.
Old Abe won't have an answer for that one.
You're a liar.
We have now heard the leading argument.
For the 2 candidates for the high office of United States Senator from Illinois.
Judge Stephen A. Douglas.
And Mr Abraham Lincoln.
According to the usual custom of debate.
Each of the candidates will now speak in rebuttal.
Judge Douglas.
My fellow citizens.
My good friend Mr Lincoln has addressed you with his usual artless sincerity.
His pure, homely charm.
Hi perennial native humor.
He has devoted a generously large portion of his address.
To most amiable remarks ..
Upon my fine qualities as a man.
If not as a statesman.
For which I express the deepest gratitude.
But at the same time.
I most earnestly beg you.
Not to be deceived by his seeming innocence.
His carefully cultivated spirit of goodwill.
For in each of his little homilies.
Lurk concealed weapons.
Like Brutus.
In Shakespeare's immortal tragedy.
Mr Lincoln is an honorable man.
But also, like Brutus ..
He is an adept at the art ..
Of inserting daggers between an opponent's ribs.
Just when said opponent least expects it.
Behold me, ladies and gentlemen.
I am covered with scars.
How dare they laugh.
It's only a speech, mother.
Any time you say, Abe.
Mr Lincoln makes you laugh with his pungent anecdotes.
He draws tears from your eyes.
With his dramatic pictures of the plight of the black slave laborer in the South.
Always, he guides you skilfully to the threshold of truth.
But then, as you are about to cross it.
He diverts your attention elsewhere.
He never .. by any mischance.
Makes reference to the condition of labor here in the North.
Perhaps he's ignorant of the fact.
That tens of thousands of workers are now on strike.
Hungry men.
Marching through the streets in ragged order.
Promoting riots.
Because they are not paid enough to keep the flesh ..
Upon the bones of their babies.
What kind of liberty is this?
And what kind of equality?
Right!
Mr Lincoln harps constantly on this subject of "equality".
He repeats over and over the argument used by Lovejoy and other abolitionists.
To whit.
That the Declaration of Independence.
Having declared all men free and equal by divine law.
Thus Negro equality is an inalienable right.
Contrary to this is the verdict of the
Supreme Court in the case of Dred Scott.
Mr Lincoln is a lawyer.
And I presume therefore that he knows.
That when he seeks to destroy pubic confidence.
In the integrity, the inviolability of The Supreme Court.
He is preaching revolution.
He asks me to state my opinion of the Dred Scott decision.
And I answer him unequivocally.
By saying I take the decisions of The Supreme Court.
To be the law of the land.
And I intend to obey them as such.
Nor will I be swayed from that position.
By all the ranting of all the fanatics.
Who preach racial equality.
Who would ask us to vote, eat, sleep and marry with Negroes.
And I say further.
Let each State mind its own business.
And leave its neighbors alone.
If we'll stand on that principle.
Then Mr Lincoln will find.
That this great republic can exist.
Forever divided into free and slave States.
And we can go on as we have done.
Increasing in wealth.
In population, in power.
Until we shall become the admiration ..
And the terror of the world.
Listen to them yell, the empty- headed idiots.
Yelling at empty words.
He doesn't know what he's talking about. He never did.
You're upsetting your drink.
Mr Abraham Lincoln.
Go get him, Abe!
Judge Douglas has paid tribute to my skill with the a dagger.
I thank him for that.
But I must admit that he can do more with that weapon than I can.
He can keep ten daggers flashing in the air at the same time.
Fortunately, he's so good at it, none of the knives ever falls and hurts anyone.
Now you heard the judge make allusion to those ..
Who advocate voting and eating and marrying and sleeping with Negroes.
Whether he meant me specifically, I do not know.
If he did, I can only say this.
Just because I do not want a colored woman for a slave ..
I do not necessarily want her for a wife.
I do not need to have her for either.
I can just leave her alone.
In some respects, she is certainly not my equal ..
Any more than I am the judge's equal in ..
Some respects.
But in her natural right to eat the bread she earns with her own hands ..
Without asking leave of somebody else she is my equal and equal of all others.
Now you heard the judge speak about our own labor conditions.
As an American I cannot be proud that such conditions exist.
But as an American, I can ask.
Would any of the striking workers in the North ..
Elect to change places with the slaves in the South?
Will they rather not say:
The remedy is in our hands.
And still as an American.
I can say thank God we live in a system by which men have the right to strike.
I am not preaching rebellion.
I don't have to.
This country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it.
Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government.
They can exercise their constitutional right of amending it.
Or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it.
If the founding fathers gave us anything.
They gave us that.
The purpose of the Dred Scott decision is to make property ..
And nothing but property of the
Negro in all States of the Union.
It is the old issue of human rights versus property rights.
It is the eternal struggle between two principles.
The one, the common right of humanity.
The other, the divine right of Kings.
It's the same spirit which says you toil and work and earn bread and I'll eat it.
As a nation.
We began by declaring all men are created equal.
There's no mention of exceptions to that rule in the Declaration of Independence.
But we now practically read it:
"All men are created equal except Negroes."
If we are to accept this doctrine of race or class discrimination.
What is to stop us in future from decreeing ..
All men are created equal except Negroes ..
Foreigners.
Catholics.
Jews.
Or just poor people.
That is the conclusion towards which the advocates of slavery are driving us.
"Let each State mind its own business" says Judge Douglas.
"Why stir up trouble?"
This is the complacent policy of indifference to evil.
And that policy ..
I cannot but hate.
I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself.
I hate it because it denies our republic its just influence in the world.
Enables the enemies of free institutions everywhere to taunt us as hypocrites.
Causes the real friends of freedom ..
To doubt our sincerity.
And especially.
Because it forces so many good men among ourselves.
Into an open war with the very fundamentals of civil liberties.
Denying the good faith of the
Declaration of Independence.
And insisting that there is no right principle of action.
But self-interest.
In his final words tonight.
The judge said.
That we can be:
"The terror of the world".
I don't think we want to be that.
I think we would prefer to be the encouragement of the world.
The proof that at last man is worthy to be free.
But we shall provide no such encouragement ..
Unless we can establish our ability as a nation to live and grow.
And we shall surely do neither.
If these States fail to remain united.
There can be no distinction in the definition of liberty.
As between one section and another.
One class and another.
One race and another.
A house divided against itself cannot stand.
This government cannot endure permanently.
Half slave.
And half free.
"This government cannot endure permanently."
"Half slave and half free."
Here is the proof of your editorial for tomorrow, Mr Greeley.
Scrap it.
I'm going to write another one.
About a man named Lincoln.
Lincoln? Never heard of him.
You will.
Gentlemen, I beg of you. One at a time.
If Stuart is nominated he'll want to emancipate all of the slaves.
That would be the end of the Union.
I tell you that Douglas will carry the South and the West.
We've got to be sure of
New York or we lose.
And the only man ..
- Stuart will never get my vote.
Gentlemen, if you can't contain your tempers we'll never agree.
We'll never agree on any of the leading candidates. That's obvious.
What we need in this race is a dark horse.
Yes, but what's his name?
- Lincoln.
Maybe you don't know it but there is a big country out west of the Alleghenies.
With a lot of new States named
Oregon, Minnesota, California.
Which you seem never to have heard of.
Lincoln is popular out there.
And if we handle him right we can make him popular back here in the East.
Anyway, I ask you gentlemen to look him over.
Do you know him, Crimmin?
I heard him debate with Douglas.
And I can tell you one thing.
He is a vote-getter if I ever saw one.
No, they got safely to Oregon.
Didn't you ever fight the Indians, Pa?
Well not exactly. I was almost in a battle but I got lost from my men.
Were you scared?
That my boy, brings up a point of argument.
When I got back to the camp the
Colonel asked me if I'd run away.
I said, no sir. But if anybody had asked me where I was going ..
And I'd said I was going for the doctor they'd figure someone was almighty sick.
Robert, you've been smoking again.
- Yes, mother.
I've told you that I will not tolerate tobacco smoke in my sitting room ..
Or indeed in any part of my house.
Come, come, Mary. You mustn't be disrespectful to Harvard man.
Smoke it in the woodshed, Bob.
- Yes, father.
You children run upstairs.
Get ready for your supper.
Oh, Ma.
Do as your mother tells you, son.
Hello, Mr Speed.
- Hello Tad, hello Sam.
Say, Abe.
That delegation arrived in town an hour ago. They ought to be here any minute.
What delegation?
Oh, some prominent politicians and ministers, several bankers.
That kind of people.
What are they coming here for?
I don't precisely know. I presume it is to see if I'm fit to be a candidate ..
For President of The United States.
I guess they want to see if we live in a log cabin and keep pigs under the bed.
And you didn't tell me?
- I'm sorry, Mary. It slipped my mind.
You are being considered for the
Presidency but it slipped your mind?
Oh, if I had only known.
If you'd only given me time to prepare for them. Now they'll see us as we are.
Crude, sloppy western barbarians living in a house reeking of foul tobacco smoke.
And your filthy old carpet slippers.
I declare, Abraham Lincoln ..
You'd treat me with more consideration if I were a slave rather than your wife.
Go this minute and put some decent boots on.
Yes, Mary.
I know, Joshua.
You think.
Just as all the others do.
I'm a bitter nagging woman.
That I've tried to kill his spirit and dragged him down to my level.
No, Mary. I think nothing of the kind.
Remember, I know Abe too.
He's always had some obsession of some future doom.
And for eighteen years I've been trying and trying to stir him out of it.
But all my efforts have been like ..
So many waves dashing against the rock of ages.
And now the greatest opportunity comes to him. Here, right into his own house.
He must take it.
He must see that this is what he was meant to be.
But I can't persuade him of it.
I thought that I could help to shape him as I knew he should be.
And I've succeeded in nothing but in breaking myself.
Mr Lincoln.
- I've got my boots on, Mary.
You can receive them in here while I try to prepare some refreshments for them.
[ Door knocks ]
How do you, Mr Crimmin.
Glad to see you again.
Thank you, Mr Lincoln.
- Step into the parlor, gentlemen.
Come on in, Josh.
Oh no. You got to face this out by yourself, Abe.
Good luck.
Is it true that they're expecting to make Abe President?
How many times have I told you to speak of your master as "Mister Lincoln"?
He ain't my master any more than he is yours.
Besides, I've known Abe ever since he wore pants that were nought but patches.
The kettle is boiling Mrs Lincoln.
President of The United States?
If they get him back into Washington he won't never come out alive.
I hesitate to mention such a delicate matter, Mr Lincoln.
Please don't hesitate, Dr Barrett.
There has been some grave doubt about your religious beliefs.     - I know.
They always called me an atheist because
I've refused to become a church member.
And why have you refused?
I have found their articles of belief too complicated for me.
But I assure you Dr Barrett that I will gladly join at any time any church ..
Whose sole qualification for membership ..
Is obedience to the Saviour's own statement of law and gospel:
"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart."
"With all thy soul."
"With all thy mind."
"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thy self."
Well now gentlemen, if you will excuse me.
I believe Mrs Lincoln is preparing a slight collation.
And I must see if I can be of any help.
Well gentlemen, what's the verdict?
The man unquestionably is an infidel.
And a radical. He's as much of a demagogue as Douglas.
He is an idealist in a curious, primitive way.
He's a rabble-rouser pure and simple.
In my opinion this man
Lincoln is not safe.
What do you mean: not safe?
- Just that. He's a radical.
A man who devotes himself so wholeheartedly ..
To currying favor with the mob, develops a mob mentality.
And what's more, he evaded our questions.
Now please gentlemen, I may not know as much as you of economics and theology.
But I do know politics.
And what is the essential quality that we demand in our candidate?
It is simply this. That he be able to get himself elected.
Well, there's something in what you say.
And do you think he can do it?
I tell you gentlemen, in that uncouth rail-splitter ..
You may observe one of the slickest, smoothest politicians ..
That ever hoodwinked a yokel mob.
Of course he evaded your questions.
You ask him about the labor question and he said: "I believe in democracy".
You asked him about religion and he replied:
"Love thy neighbor as thyself."
Now you know you couldn't argue with that. Any of you.
The voters will love him because he's just as common as they are.
A plain, homespun American.
His very name is right.
Honest old Abe.
He'll play the game with us now ..
And he'll go right on playing it after we get him into the White House.
He will do just what we tell him.
Look, Mr Crimmin.
Now gentlemen, if you will step into the dining room ..
Mrs Lincoln will be pleased to serve you with a cup of tea.
Thank you.
- Well, this is most gracious.
Bring your cigar with you, Mr Crimmin.
Thank you. Thank you.
Does Mr Lincoln seem to be worrying any?
- No. He's in there reading a newspaper.
Lincoln and Douglas neck-and-neck in Illinois.
Maryland is going all for
Bell and Breckinridge.
Abe, you're not doing fair in Maryland.
I see the New York Herald says
I got the soul of Uriah Heep ..
Cased in the body of a baboon.
What does it say about New York?
Douglas 117,000. Lincoln 106,000.
He's winning over you in New York, Abe.
Not yet, Mary. These returns so far are coming mostly from the city ..
Where Douglas is bound to run the strongest.
What's it look like in
Pennsylvania, Ninian?
There's nothing to worry about there, Mary. It's safe for Abe.
In fact there is no need to worry at all.
Yes, you've said that over and over all evening. There is no need to worry.
How can we help worrying when every new bulletin shows Douglas ahead?
But every one of them shows Abe gaining.
Let 'em count all the votes in New York.
You'll be on the way to the White house.
Why don't they hurry with it?
When do those returns come in?
They'll come in soon enough.
Telegram from New York.
Mr Belmont states Mr Douglas has filed a majority 50,000 votes in New York City.
Ah, shut up!
The mob down there is sickening.
Cheering every bulletin that's splashed on the wall whether good news or bad.
And they cheer every picture of every candidate including George Washington ..
With the same fine ignorant enthusiasm.
Maybe they can't tell the difference.
The reporter are outside,
Mr Lincoln. They want to know ..
What will be your first official action after you are elected.
What do you want us tell them, Abe?
- Say I'm thinking of growing a beard.
A what?
Whatever put that idea in your head?
I had a letter from a little girl saying whiskers would give me more dignity.
And I'll need it if elected.
"Missouri. Douglas 35,000."
"Dell 33, Breckinridge 16."
"Lincoln 8."
Mr Lincoln, you're being them beaten badly in Rhode Island.
What are they cheering for?
- They don't know.
The Chicago Times says:
"Lincoln breaks down".
"His heart fails him, his tongue fails him, his legs failed him."
"He fails all over."
"Douglas skins the living dog."
Stop it!
I can't stand it any longer.
Yes my dear. I think you should go home. I'll join you presently.
I won't go home.
You only want to be rid of me.
That's all you wanted, ever since the day we were married.
And before that, anything to get me out of your sight because you hate me.
And it's the same with all of you.
All his friends. You hate me.
You wish I'd never come into his life.
- No, ma'am.
Will you all please step out for a minute.
Why do you use every opportunity you can to make a public fool me and yourself?
It's bad enough when you act like that in the privacy of our own home.
But here in front of people?
You are not to do that again, do you hear.
You are never to do that again.
You've never spoke to me like that before.
You've lost your temper, Abe.
You've never done that before.
I'm sorry.
I still think you should go home ..
Rather than stay here and endure the strain of this death-watch.
This is the night I dreamed about when I was a child.
When I was an excited young girl ..
And all the gay young gentlemen in Springfield were courting me.
And I fell in love with the least likely of them.
This is the night I'm waiting to hear my husband has become ..
President of The United States.
And even if he does.
It's ruined for me.
It's too late.
Is mother alright?
- Yes, son.
She gone home. You'd better go with her.
- Yes, sir.
It looks like 74 electoral votes.
Sure for you.
And 27 more probably.
New York will give you the election.
Mark my words, Mr Lincoln.
This election is wrapped up tightly in a neat bundle ..
Ready to deliver on your doorstep tonight.
We fought the good fight and we won.
We fought the good fight.
The dirtiest campaign in the history of corrupt politics.
And if I win.
I must fulfil all the dishonest pledges made in my name.
You gentlemen have all been friends of our candidate for a long time.
So possibly you can answer a question that has been puzzling me considerably.
Can I possibly be correct in supposing that he doesn't want to win?
The answer is yes.
Well, I can only say that for me this is all a refreshingly new experience.
Would you want to become President of The United States at this time?
Haven't you read the newspapers lately?
Why yes. I try to follow the events of the day.
Don't you realize that they've raised
10,000 volunteers in South Carolina?
They are armed. The governor has issued a proclamation ..
Saying that if Mr Lincoln is elected, the State will secede tomorrow.
And every other State south of the Dixon line will go with it.
Can you see what that means?
War. Civil war.
He'll have the whole terrible responsibility for it.
The man who's never wanted anything in his life but to be let alone in peace.
Calm down, Billy.
Go get yourself another drink.
Mr Edwards, here it is!
"At 10:30 tonight the New York
Herald conceded that Mr Lincoln .."
"Had carried the State by a majority of 25,000 and had won the election!"
Listen to 'em, Abe. Listen to that crazy howling mob down there.
That's all for you, Mr Lincoln.
Abe .. get out there and make them a speech.
No, I don't want to go out there.
I think I'll go home and tell Mary.
This is Captain Kavanagh, Mr President.
I've been detailed to accompany you,
Mr Lincoln in the event you're elected.
I am grateful to you, Captain.
But I don't need you.
You had better have us, sir. Sorry.
I don't want to be alarming.
I guess you know as well as I do that threats are made against your life.
Goodnight, Josh.
Ninian, Mr Crimmin.
Billy.
Thank you.
One moment, sir.
With your permission, I'll go first.
Steve, it's good of you to come.
Abe, you and I have been adversaries for a good many years.
We've indulged in mortal combat on every conceivable issue.
But now, you are
President of The United States.
And I want you to know that I'm fighting with you.
Steve, you're a good generous man.
Speech!
Speech!
Say something, Abe.
- Speech!
They want you to say something, Abe.
My dear friends, I have to say goodbye to you now.
Leaving for Washington with my new whiskers of which I hope you approve.
No, no Lieutenant! Let them come on.
They are all old friends of mine.
No-one not in my situation ..
Can appreciate my feelings of sadness at this parting.
To this place and the kindness of you people, I owe everything.
I now leave not knowing when or whether ever I may return.
It is a grave duty that I must face.
In preparing for it.
I have tried to enquire.
What great principle or ideal it is ..
Which has kept this
Union so long together.
And I believe that it was not ..
The mere matter of separation of the colonies from the motherland.
But that sentiment in the
Declaration of Independence.
Which gave liberty to the people of this country.
And hope to all the world.
We gained democracy.
And there is now doubt whether it is fit to survive.
I've heard an Eastern monarch ..
Who once charged his wise men to invent him a sentence ..
Which should be true and appropriate at all times and situations.
They presented him with the words:
"And this too shall pass away."
That's a comforting thought in times of affliction.
And this too shall pass away.
Yet.
Let us believe that it is not true.
Let us live to prove that we can cultivate the natural world around us.
And the intellectual and moral world within us.
So that we may secure an individual ..
Social ..
And political prosperity.
Whose course shall be forward.
And which while this earth endures ..
Shall not pass away.
I commend you to the care of the Almighty.
And I hope in your prayers you may remember me.
Friends, one and all.
I must now bid you an affectionate farewell.
[ Singing: ]
"Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord."
Bye, Abe.
"He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored."
"He hath loosed the fateful lightning of Hîs terrible swîft sword."
"His truth is marching on."
"Glory, Glory, hallelujah!"
"Glory, Glory, hallelujah!"
"Glory, Glory, hallelujah!"
"His truth is marching on."
"Glory, Glory, hallelujah!"
"His truth is marching on."
T-G oö
Over this ocean...
1607,Jamestown...
1620, Plymouth Rock...
this way we came.
We, the people.
We crossed the ocean toward an unknown land.
Here was America...
the sea, the sky and the continent.
We came in search of freedom...
but there were dangers in the deep woods and nowhere to put in a plow.
Our only roads were the flooded rivers.
We were alone.
But we took hold.
Out of oak and pine we built a house, a church, a watchtower.
We crossed the first hills...
and there were mountains beyond.
We cleared a field and built our first settlements.
But every winter brought death...
cold months and little food...
and many died of fever.
We planted our bodies and our seeds in these fields...
and there grew up a colony of free citizens.
Here on this stony seacoast...
we founded liberty.
We built liberty into the beams of our houses.
We made states in the green wilderness...
Virginia, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, Carolina.
We, the plain people...
plowman and pioneer...
lived and fought and dreamed a new kind of nation...
a new kind oflife...
under a new sky...
free of all tyranny.
Lexington, Valley Forge, Yorktown.
1776... We had to defend our freedom with arms.
Independence.
In the midst ofbattle...
we declared our independence...
taking courage from the greatness of our country.
These are the times that try men's souls.
Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered.
We fought a seven-year war.
Our freedom took shape.
We spoke our deepest needs through the lips ofheroes.
"We hold these truths to be self-evident...
that all men are created equal"...
The voice of Thomas Jefferson...
"that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights...
"that among them are life, liberty...
and the pursuit ofhappiness. "
And so we proclaimed a new world.
In this brotherhood America began...
one nation indivisible...
with liberty and justice for all...
the immigrant, hungry for bread and for liberty...
the brave and the persecuted...
the pioneer in the Kentucky forest.
We established a Bill of Rights...
and led by Lincoln we fought a Civil War...
to extend those rights to the whole people.
Slavery shall not exist.
No law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press...
or the right of the people peaceably to assemble.
In the name ofliberty...
we opened the roads to the west.
We crossed the blue Alleghenies...
the Ohio, the Mississippi...
the last ranges of the Rockies.
We took freedom with us.
More than a word...
it was an ax to clear the continent.
New resources, new power.
We came in millions toward the machine.
We forged wheels out of coal, out of iron ore, out of rushing water...
wheels for a new country.
America growing.
Machines and people.
Three million, 100 million,
130 million.
From every country in the world we came toward freedom...
toward life, liberty, all men created equal and the pursuit ofhappiness.
The old words, the historic documents...
we built them into bridges and dynamos and concrete cities.
Freedom, happiness... not always a fact...
but always a shining hope.
Freedom... a way ofliving and oflooking at life.
The frontiersman part of it...
and the cowboy part of it...
and the steel rigger and the sailor.
Democracy... fought for and built into the steel girders of America.
We struggled 300 years and took freedom as our inheritance.
More than a dream, more than a document...
the Bill of Rights meant a way oflife...
a way oflife for all Americans...
for a Michigan farmer working his own land.
Hey, Pop!
Hey, Popl
Whoa!
- Some men want to see you, Popl
- Who wants to see your pop? The feed man?
Huh?
- Well, who is it?
- Some men in a big, new car.
Mom says to come right away.
Hey, Popl
One man's got a diamond on his finger.
As shiny as anything!
You oughta see!
You stay with the horses.
I never saw them before.
They wanted to know if you were Mr. Hill.
Can't deny that.
Then they asked me if you were the Mr. Hill that spoke up at the farmers meeting last night... and I said, "You bet!"
Fred?
Invite 'em in for a bite.
Fred!
Fred? Fred!
Fred!
Is that you, Fred?
A man's farm invaded...
his liberty attacked.
The right of free speech denied to an American.
It happened in Custer, Michigan,
September 1934.
"Never heard of it. "
People never heard of it.
Twenty miles down the river, people in the next town going their own way...
taking the Bill of Rights for granted...
unaware of what happened to one man far away.
People in American towns...
busy with work, children and what's for supper.
In Hartford or Troy or Dallas.
Or Cleveland, Ohio, a spring day in 1936.
Mister.
Will you let me in, mister?
It's late.
Again. It happened again.
They say he was a union man.
Nothing in the newspapers.
Wasn't on the radio.
Don't understand it.
New York, Chicago, Cleveland...
Fort Smith, Arkansas.
A country church used as a meeting place by Negro and white sharecroppers.
It was midsummer, 1936.
They wanted 10 cents more for their cotton...
just enough to live on.
They held a meeting.
The sheriff deputized 15 men.
Cover the back doorl
Get him!
- There he goesl

# The morning and the evening sun #

#Over my head #
#Burnin'sun #

The South in July.
Cotton country.
Two men dead on a road in Arkansas.
A road far away.
Another valley.
The long afternoon kept moving across America.
Getting cool. Suppertime.
Few knew, and few remembered...
the sudden acts of a hidden enemy...
the rights of plain Americans destroyed.
Darkness blotted out the violence of the day...
the sharecroppers hunted in the Arkansas swamp...
the organizer killed in a rooming house...
the farmer struck down on his own farm...
and night erased them all...
for 130 million Americans.
Another day began.
#Open the window, hear it coming #
#Here's another new day #
#Everyday day comin'up the avenue #
#Morning on wheels #
#American day #
It was Thursday morning in a thousand places.
Friday morning.
Or Monday morning.
#Lift up the window
What's for today #
#May be hot, but probably cool #
#No special day but turning out wonderful #
#Morning on wheels #
#American day #
These are the ones...
the innocent ones.
Never hurt anyone.
Never could.
Little people unaware of powerful enemies.
Little people in the towns, the suburbs, the smoky cities.
Was America waking up?
Was every day in the year.
The eyes of children watching a bright world.
Sunlight in the house.
And what's for breakfast?
The faces of morning...
multiplied by a million.
A million streets waiting for the touch of people.
Millions of ordinary people...
who take the Bill of Rights for granted.
#Early this morning I heard that whistle #
# Wake up, brother
Wake up #
#Gonna eat my breakfast with the sun in the window #
#Saying hello #
#A wonderful day #
#Friday, Tuesday #
#Early morning #
# Weekday, workday #
#Any morning #
#Early this morning
I heard that whistle #
Yoo-hoo, brotherl
# Yoo-hoo #
#Got a place to go to and I guess I'd better hurry #
#Morning on wheels #
#American day ##
Today and every day...
going in pursuit ofhappiness...
going to work, pushing forward to a fuller life.
Here was the Bill of Rights again, the feeling of security...
of faith without words...
the simple rhythm of millions of people going every day...
to bring the machines to life.
Abundance.
Take the abundance of it.
The things that are planned and made and delivered...
milk and shoes and iron and gasoline...
and overcoats and kitchen chairs.
Things we need every day in the week made by the people.
Who else?
Proud of our hands and our skill...
and a quick eye...
and the strength in our backs when we come to need it.
Making locomotives and airplanes...
tanks and kilowatt hours.
Thousands of products made at the same time.
Work going on all over America.
Digging into the ground and building into the sky.
Here, in the heat and noise of these shops...
a new kind of person was being molded.
A new kind of American, no longer alone...
but working with others...
working together on the same assembly line...
the same machine, the same product.
The new factories, the new industries...
the mass production of goods for 130 million Americans.
That takes cooperation.
That takes the adjustment of man to man, of job to job.
Many men turning out a single car, a single tank...
accomplishing a single task.
They learned to work together...
and therefore they had to learn to think together, to move together...
to act together...
to grapple with the tough problems of the 20th century.
The word "brother. "
The word "cooperative. "
The word "union. "
America took up stronger than ever the idea of community action.
Tenant leagues, public forums, committees, clubs.
The idea of union took hold of the American people.
These were the new pioneers.
Facing a new frontier...
they put the Bill of Rights into action.
Here's what they wanted with the Bill of Rights...
bread and butter and old-age pensions...
and health insurance and a 40-hour week.
Yes, they were confident.
Overconfident.
Democracy?
Every day in the week.
The pursuit ofhappiness?
They'd put it in the union contract.
They felt their own power.
They had come out of the Depression.
They had plans.
Yet this man's name was on file in an office building 600 miles away.
Ordinary building.
Lobby as usual.
Typewriters, telephones, file cases... ordinary business.
Hello... Good morning... Good afternoon...
Dear sir... My dear sir...
We trust... We firmly believe...
In a position to handle with a minimum...
Delivery somewhat delayed...
Arrangements which you will agree...
We are sure...
Most satisfactory... Most satisfactory...
Two dozen Little Giant gas grenades, triple "X."
One Thompson submachine gun with three additional magazines.
A complete line, from undercover men to riot guns.
Assure you we are entirely confidential.
Trouble is our business, so to speak.
Entirely confidential.
The phone rang, and a man was bribed.
Traps for weak men...
good openings for criminals.
Behind the front of everyday business...
conspiracy against the lives of innocent men.
- It's a liel
- Let me at him!
- Quit shovin'!
- Let's take a lookl
- It's a lie!
- Hey, pipe down, boys!
What are you doing?
Get away from that doorl
What did I tell you?
How 'bout it, Mack?
You can't come in yet.
I wouldn't pull a thing like that!
I'm a good union man!
I seen him plain as day.
Hey, fellas, I think they found somethin'I
No kiddin'I What do you knowl
How do you like that dirty ratl
Stop pushin', will ya!
Go get 'im, Archl
Hey, Arch, get in therel
Aw, Mack stopped him.
Awwl
I know how you feel, fella, but that's no way to act.
Listen. Wait a minute...
Wait a minute... I'll tell you how...
- Take it easy.
- All right.
Harry had this guy's number, all right.
A number-one rat.
Writing names and notes of the meeting on the inside of his vest.
Bring him out here, Mack.
I'll fix his wagon.
Guy sits in a union meetin'...
Bring him out here, Mackl We'll fix his wagonl
How do you like that?
I'll kill that louse!
Okay, okay.
That's what he deserves.
Bring him out here!
Now, wait a minute. Wait a minutel
We know who planted Brown here.
You want to play into the hands of the company?
Fine thing to read in tomorrow's paper:
"Worker beaten in union hall. "
That'd be a swell way to give our union a black eye.
Why, they'd smear us left and right.
Just what they're waiting for.
Aw, but, Mack, this guy is sittin'right alongside of us...
Let's keep order. This is a meeting.
I wanna make a proposal.
- All those in favor, say "aye!"
- Ayel
- Ayel
- Ayel
Okay, line up!
Bring him out, Harry.
Now walk.
And walk slow!
Take a good, long look.
This spy was sent in here to break up the union...
put our names on the blacklist, get us thrown out on the street.
Once a stool like this is known, he's washed up.
So look at him good.
Take a good, long look, and never forget that fink's face as long as you live.
My vest!
Put it on for himl
What he needs is a straitjacket.
- Write his name on itl That's what I sayl
- Hey!
Good-bye to the finkl
Sure had your eyes open that time, fella.
- Attaboy, Harry.
- You had your eyes open, kid.
You oughta pass a vote of thanks. I mean it.
What a performancel
Say, this Harry is a great actorl
And then he says,
"I seen him plain as day. "
And then he pulls every last button off my vestl
Real tough, just like
Humphrey Bogart in the moviesl
Okay, Jim.
Next stop, California.
Get your money and leave tonight.
Sunny California?
Oh, boy!
Well, so long, Harry.
So long.
Keep buttoned up.
You'll rise high in the labor movement.
Good work, Carlyle. You did a very good job, and the company appreciates it.
You're gonna go far.
We're giving you a little bonus.
Now, if you'll just sign there... the cashier'll take care of you on the way out.
We, uh... We want you to get to work on your next job.
Now that they've made you vice president, it oughta be quite simple.
We want the who's-who.
I wanna quit!
They'll never let me get it.
I wanna be let out.
The whole thing's dynamite.
Besides, it's in the safe.
They'd never let me get near it.
I can't get it, I tell ya.
Not bad.
He is a good actor.
You said it would only be a little checkup on efficiency for the stockholders.
You got me in too deep already.
You've gotta let me out of thisl
Funny thing.
A funny thing, Carlyle.
Joe here was just telling me about a former employee of ours out in Akron.
He was picked up the other day...
with internal injuries.
Had a hemorrhage.
As I always say, loyalty is the best policy.
I advise you to keep that in the front of your mind.
Harry's okay, chief.
We'll get it.
You'll get it for us, won't you?
Try it.
Come on there.
Toss that ball down to second base.
Dah! Doh!
Uh-oh!
# Deet-det-doo, doo-deet-doh #
Oh, he's smilingl Lookl
Harry, hold the baby, will you?
What's the trouble?
Speak up.
Who's going to go to bed now? Hmm?
Ooh!
Oh!
You get in touch with the others.
Meeting'll be in the same place.
I'll be over soon.
Harry's here with me.
Harry?
Harry, come here a minute, will ya?
- What's up, Mack?
- They broke into the union hall.
Turned the place inside out.
- They get anything?
- Not what they're after.
I have the membership book right here.
Look, Harry,
I want you to take it.
These boys mean business.
They're likely to try here next.
You take it. You're a new officer.
They won't suspect you.
Hide it in your room for a few days.
Okay, Mack.
You're right. That's right.
I'll take it.
It'll be safer with me.
I'll walk over to the hall, see what's what.
Mary'll give me the devil for not taking her to the movies.
Look, Harry, tell her
I'll be back early, will ya?
Take good care of it, boy.
Leaving us?
Mack asked me to tell you he went down to the union hall.
No need to worry.
He'll be back soon.
Well, bye-bye.
You know, I haven't got a lot of time.
I gotta get to that meeting.
If I had it, wouldn't I give it to you?
Hey, that cost me 20 bucks!
I like music.
You wouldn't think a guy like me... would pay that much for a uke.
Don't you guys trust anybody?
Okay, Harry. No hard feelings.
I tell you, I haven't got it!
#Boss comes up to me with a five-dollar bill #
#Says, "Get you some whiskey, boy and drink your fill"#
#Get thee behind me, Satan #
# Travel on down the line #
#I am a union man #
#Gonna leave you behind #
#A redheaded woman took me out to dine #

#Get thee behind me, Satan ##
"About 3:00 p. M...
"I saw Manetti and a welder they call Frenchie.
"Talked about the new piecework rate and said plenty.
"Which made them all feel mad toward the company.
They're talking union. "
Hmm. Company found this very useful.
Your reports are very good.
Very good.
Very complete.
"Invited to the union meeting held in a house at 11 Elm Street.
"Getting regular headquarters soon.
I joined up quick. "
Sit down! You make me nervous!
"Harry Carlyle, K2-17.
"Signed K2-17.
"McComb likes me.
We had beer together.
"McComb's a regular one-man radio station.
"Thanks for the $45 January.
"P.S. Received $40 for December.
"July the 12th.
"Supper with the McCombs.
"Says that by September the union will be strong enough...
"to stop the speedup.
"While I was playing with a baby, a phone call comes...
saying that the hall was robbed, but they didn't get anything. "
What are you doing?
What are you gonna do?
I thought maybe the boys at your union...
would like to see your reports.
Give me a chance to think.
You got it.
You had it all the time, you dirty chiseler.
#On the Fourth ofJuly the politicians say #
# Vote for us and we'll raise your pay #
#Get thee behind me, Satan #
# Travel on down the line #
#I am a union man #

#So then the company union sent out a call #
# They said, "Join us in the summer

#Get thee behind me, Satan #
# Travel on down the line #
#I am a union man #
#Gonna leave you behind #
Ah, he should be here by now.
#If anyone should ask you your union to sell #
#Just tell him where... ##
I gotta go.
They're waiting for me.
It's nearly 8:00 already.
It takes 20 minutes to get there.
I can't do itl They'd kill me.
Put me in the hospital.
What do you suppose they'll do when they read these?
They'd know it's me.
They'd put the finger on me.
When you come across, we'll double it.
- Well, Harry?
- You gotta give me protection.
Sure.
Sure. They won't know anything about it.
We do this every day in the week.
Stop sweating.
When I fix you up, they'll think you're St. Francis.
Well, what do you say, Harry?
#Come, all of you good workers #
#Good news to you I'll tell #
#Ofhow the good old union #
#Has come in here to dwell #
# Which side are you on
Which side are you on #
#My daddy was a miner #
#And I'm a miner's son #
#And I'll stick with the union #
# Till every battle's won #
# Which side are you on

# They say in Harlan County #
- # There are no neutrals there ##
- Hey, what's happened to Harry?
- He just keeled over.
- Harry!
- Watch out for his arm.
- Take it easy.
Mack, take a look at him, will you?
Let me see him, boys.
They stole the membership book... all the names.
They stole the membership book.
Bought and paid for.
One spy in a key position.
One act ofbetrayal.
One list of union names.
Bought and paid for.
McComb,J.,: Manetti, F.,: Moore, B.,:
Smith, G.,: Petruski, F.
One at a time.

Month after month without a job.
New Orleans longshoreman.
Detroit tool and dye man.
It's all over. You're through.
Blacklisted.
Where was the right to organize?
Where was the Bill of Rights?
Here's how we tore up the blacklist.
Here's how we smashed the spy system under our feet.
We fought the secret payroll.
We won back our rights as Americans.
We reorganized.
We went on the march.
No more fear in the streets.
No more meetings in the dark.
We carried our names in the open air.
A thousand new members a day...
two and a half million new people never organized before.
Organization. A new declaration of independence for the people.
More than a weapon for democracy...
the unions grew to be the center of people's lives...
a place to go to...
a chance to go on a boat ride, a place to laugh and dance...
a place to bring their wives and kids.
Life, liberty? Yes.
But also the pursuit ofhappiness.
We cleared the poison out of the air.
Money for shoes and meat and oranges.
Baseball and sunshine.
Job security, and a billion dollars more in wages.
The people were on their way once more.
Unions were doubled, tripled in one year.
Spies cannot stop this wave of organization.
You can't blacklist a whole people.
The auto union started with 30,000 members.
In a year, they had 400,000.
Textile alone organized half a million.
Steel and coal added up to a million and a quarter.
Here, in their organizations, was the new strength of the people.
A.F. Of L. And C.I. O...
and railroad brotherhoods.
Millions oflittle people banded together to protect each other.
Millions oflittle people like Frank Mason...
a grocer in Memphis, Tennessee.
- Ooh!
- His neighbors were union people.
- Look out. Look out!
- He shared their interests...
helped them organize, contributed money when he could.
Oohl
Watch out!
Ooh!
Careful now. It'll breakl
We hear you've been giving your money away again.
This is an open-shop town.
You don't seem to learn!
Pay your bills and get out of town!
Hey, kid. Want a plum?
Here. What's the matter?
Go on. Taste it. Nice and juicy.
Your friend wants you to eat it.
Here.
You leave that child alone!
Your friend don't live here anymore.
Get wise.
Don't get in the way.
Twenty years in Memphis.
Raised a family here.
Pay him a little visit, teach him what's what.
Keep it secret.
Spring it on him.
Coming out of nowhere, find the key man, the best organizer...
the man you can't buy.
Murder one man, frighten a thousand.
It's technique.
Get the whole county in the palm of your hand.
Pick up the poolroom sharks, give 'em a badge. Citizens'committee.
Plenty of whiskey and brand-new riot guns.
Break up the unions once and for all.
Ambridge, Pennsylvania.
Two union members dead.
Brooklyn, New York.
There'd been a peaceful demonstration.
San Francisco.
That's the stuff.
That's the technique.
The open shop's the American way.
Mobilize the respectable elements of the community.
Rights? We gotta have action.
We gotta have law and order in this fair city of ours.
Anybody talks about rights... slap 'em down.
In the state of Florida.
In the state of Pennsylvania.
In our own town... on our own streets... there are two men dying in the county hospital.
But we cannot turn our faces aside.
They are our brothers.
They were gathered in peaceful assembly... and that was their right.
They were unarmed and unafraid... and they were met with coldhearted, brutal attack.
I've been advised to say nothing.
Powerful and respectable people in this community have come to me... have phoned to me repeatedly... have urged me not to deliver this sermon.
That would be easy, perhaps... but I will not be guilty of such silence.
This crime has been with me day and night.
I've longed for Sunday to come... the Lord's day... that I might speak out from the height of this pulpit.
There's been too much silence.
This armed assault against the sons of God must be called by its name.
It is sin.
It is contempt for human life... the worst sin of all.
There are men with high office in this community... who would silence brave teachers... violate our free elections... write injustice into law... all in the name of patriotism.
Men with great names have hired criminals... have paid weak men to spy on their brothers... have expended secret money to set Christian againstJew... and white against colored... to brand every immigrant a dangerous enemy.
Why, they would even fingerprint
Jesus, the carpenter of Nazareth... if they could.
We must grapple with this evil thing... before the forces of darkness arise with fire and sword... to break down the very doors of our church.
Today, now... we must speak, act, vote, protest... before it is too late!
On the road north of Tampa, Florida...
the night of November 30, 1935.
Joseph Shoemaker, Eugene Poulnot.
These men were leaders of the Modern Democrats.
They had almost defeated the Klan in the city elections.
They had dared to enter progressive candidates in the primaries...
pledged to smash the political machine of the K.K.K.
Shoemaker and Poulnot, and a third man, Dr. Rogers...
were dragged from a meeting earlier this evening...
arrested by the police, held without charge...
and then released into the arms of the Klan.
Here was treason in America...
the face of fascism.
The K.K.K., the Black Legion.
Associated Farmers, Silver Shirts...
Christian Front.
Lives tortured.
Blackmail, lynch law...
Dr. Rogers tarred and feathered.
Ministers, teachers forced from their profession.
Open terror and secret persecution.
Whatever their masks, these forces hated one thing...
the practice of democracy.
These crimes could no longer be hidden from America.
Meetings were called everywhere.
The news spread from city to city.
It was a slow thing, this anger of decent people.
Each protest had a thousand roots...
men blacklisted for years...
people who lived in the valleys of fear.
They turned their tragedy into action...
put their plain words on paper...
letters, resolutions, telegrams.
One message to Washington...
Frisco to Washington.
Jersey to Washington.
Birmingham, Akron to Washington.
It was "We, the people" speaking out loud.
We were sick and bitter and angry.
We wanted facts.
We wanted action.
Vicksburg to Washington.
Tulsa to Washington.
Boston to Washington.
Seattle to Washington.
That was the thunder of our voices...
demanding that light be turned on these hidden crimes.
In the 76th Congress, a resolution was passed...
authorizing an investigation of the violations of civil liberties...
and the rights oflabor.
Bad news.
Bad news for the big shots, for the spy agencies.
Rumors of senate subpoenas.
Bad news for the tear gas salesman.
Not in today.
Out of town.
Correspondence? Never keep it.
Business? Strictly cash.
Don't answer unless you have to.
Strikebreaking? Never do it.
Stool pigeons? Never use 'em.
We'll never know the full story.
We'll never know all the facts.
They destroyed the dates, the names, the figures.
But they were too late.
The bags of waste were subpoenaed by the senate committee.
They sorted out the millions of scraps of paper...
documents, letters, receipts.
Evidence on paper and confirmed by witnesses.
Checked and rechecked.
Sixty-five volumes of testimony.
Bit by bit...
a patient reconstruction of a crime.
A single steel company possessing 500 revolvers.
Vice president of a national union revealed as a Pinkerton spy.
It began to add up...
the technique of terror, the arithmetic of fear.
Unseen.
A plan with a single aim.
Backed by billions of dollars...
by the resources of the biggest corporations...
this conspiracy entangled the whole United States.
But it was kept secret...
till the senate committee turned on the light.
Spies.
The senate revealed the spies of a secret war.
All over the country, planted in every local...
41,000 labor spies...
an $80 million payroll.
The senate revealed the existence of private armies...
armies of criminals organized for a secret war in every state of the union.
Armed vigilantes, strikebreakers, company police...
paid by private corporations.
Private arsenals.
The senate revealed private arsenals...
of tear gas, shotguns, machine guns...
for a war against Americans.
Millions of rounds of ammunition.
Millions of dollars spent in secret.
And a system of nationwide propaganda...
used to attack progressive legislation...
newspapers, lobbies, the radio, full-page advertisements...
extending across the whole country.
Propaganda, arsenals...
private armies, spies.
The senate exposed the secret connections...
the interlocking parts of an immense conspiracy...
directed by a handful of fascist-minded corporations.
Here was a criminal conspiracy to undermine the Bill of Rights...
to weaken the strength of Americans...
exposed.
Exposed to the light of day.
The American people had won again.
Their enemies could no longer operate in disguise.
The newly won rights of the people...
collective bargaining, unemployment insurance...
were backed by the strength of organization.
Democracy was coming back.
Memorial Day...
1937.
The lilacs were gone.
The roses were in full bloom.
Living Americans honored the dead.
The memory of those who declared independence...
the men who fought against human slavery.
Memorial Day.
A moment in the history of the Bill of Rights.
A day of flags, flowers and trumpets.
A summer holiday.
Memorial Day.
America without fear.
Sunlight all day.
A cool west wind.
And millions of people in the public parks.
Time to rest.
Time to be happy.
What do people want out oflife?
Not very much. Not too much.
Enough to eat, and a family.
Pay the rent.
And some kind of future.
A holiday of rest and play...
and no thought of danger.
At that moment, out in Chicago...
2,000 people walking toward the Republic Steel plant...
were blocked by the police.
The mayor declared peaceful picketing would be permitted.
These facts were proved.
An act of fascism.
Ten killed, 90 injured.
The act of a desperate minority.
The dead were all shot in the back.
He was a fine man.
I'd like to say a few words in the way of good-bye.
Hard to know what to say.
Never thought I'd come to carry Whitey down here.
We were the same as brothers.
Everybody considered we were brothers.
They started firing at us... and I saw him fall down.
When I saw it,
I didn't believe it.
To take away a man's life...
Shouldn't get away with a thing like that.
He had a right to go on that line.
He was the kind of man who stood up for his rights.
We don't forget that.
Never.
No.
We don't forget this ground...
the blood that has run into this ground.
How many times?
For 300 years, there were wounds and sweat...
and battles without names.
We rememberJefferson and Adams...
Jackson, Frederick Douglass and John Brown.
America forged in the heat ofbattle.
We fought for liberty in every generation.
We don't forget our victories.
Freedom, won step by step...
in a struggle of 300 years.
Out of a raw continent, we created a new world.
We, the people, laboring all these years...
pushing the frontier back from ocean to ocean...
plowing freedom into the dark soil.
We defended our valleys against all enemies.
We fought to make America the name for liberty.
City and farm, we organized millions...
to unite the people, to make the Bill of Rights a reality...
to make the nation strong.
We pushed forward the horizons of our freedom...
into the 20th century.
We built liberty into the beams of our houses...
the house of America...
which we will guard against every enemy within and without.
Here, we put the life of 300 years...
the dream...
the work of 300 years...
our fruit and our harvest...
our states full of farms.
We set the foundations of our cities on the rock of the Bill of Rights.
And yet today, our liberty is in danger.
The freedom we have won from enemies abroad...
must be saved again from enemies within.
Once more the old enemy rises to threaten the four freedoms.
The rights of all Americans... every creed and every color...
to a job, a home...
adequate food and medical care...
the right to bargain collectively...
to act for the greatest good of the greatest number...
the right to live at peace unthreatened...
threatening no one.
Today these words must become deeds...
for there has never been a moment in our history...
when Americans were not ready to stand up as free men...
and fight for their rights.
We don't forget that.
Never.
