The channel's here on the chart.
So are the marking lights.
Then what's wrong with them?
Those lights don't seem to be in just the right place.
They're both a bit out of position, according to this.
Two light buoys mean a safe channel between the world over.
"Safe between the world over" doesn't go in these waters.
Look here. You'll see the water shoals on the island side... while the deep soundings run to the mainland.
Have any of you seen the captain today?
- No. He wasn't down for dinner.
- No, and he wasn't down for lunch.
He hasn't left the bridge since you decided to come through the channel.
What are you driving at?
Ever since you gave him those orders yesterday to cut through these waters... he's had the jitters.
There's something wrong. I...
Hey, I'm getting nervous myself.
Doc, what do you recommend for nerves?
- Give him a shot of scotch.
- Give the whole bottle.
- No! I've got nerves too.
- Here you are, Doc.
Just what you need.
- Well, maybe you're right.
- And how, boy.
- Good evening, Captain.
- Good evening, sir.
- May I speak with you?
- Why, certainly. Go ahead.
We're heading straight for the channel between Branca Island and the mainland.
- Good.
- But the lights are just a bit off, according to the chart.
The charts are never up to date in this part of the Pacific. You know that.
I know, sir, but...
Doesn't Branca Island mean anything to you?
- Well, not a lot.
- Perhaps if I spoke with Mr. Rainsford...
Bob's not a sailor.
He's a hunter.
He's made many of these trips.
He's young, but he has judgment.
I'll call him.
- Oh, Bob. Bob!
- What is it?
- Come up here, will ya?
- Just a minute.
What's bothering you, Captain?
There are no more coral-reefed, shark-infested waters in the whole world than these.
Boy! Just take a look at these.
You didn't turn out so hot as a hunter,
Doc, but oh, what a photographer.
If we'd had you to take pictures on the Sumatran trip... they might have believed my book.
If you'd had me on the Sumatran trip, you'd have never had me on this one.
Say, here's a swell one of the ship, Skipper. What's the matter?
These old sea dogs tell yarns to kid each other... and end up believing it all themselves.
I think that Mr. Rainsford should know... that the channel lights aren't just in the position given on the charts.
Oh. Well, what do you think, fellas?
I think we should turn back and take the outside course.
We'll go ahead.
Very well, sir.
It's your ship.
"It was the schooner 'Hesperus,' and she sailed the wintry sea. "
Now, wait a minute, fellas.
Let's talk this over.
- There's no use taking any chances.
- Chances? That's fine talk... coming from a fella who just got through slapping tigers in the face.
Get an eyeful of this.
And he talks about taking chances.
Here's the doc charging the enemy with an unloaded camera.
Get the expression on Doc's face, Bill.
He looks more frightened than the tiger.
- He is.
- What'd you have on your mind, Doc?
I'll tell you what I had on my mind.
I was thinking of the inconsistency of civilization.
The beast of the jungle killing just for his existence is called savage.
The man, killing just for sport, is called civilized.
- Hear! Hear!
- It's a bit contradictory, isn't it?
Now, just a minute.
What makes you think... it isn't just as much sport for the animal as it is for the man?
Take that fellow right there, for instance.
There never was a time when he couldn't have gotten away.
He didn't want to.
He got interested in hunting me.
He didn't hate me for stalking him... any more than I hated him for trying to charge me.
As a matter of fact, we admired each other.
Perhaps, but would you change places with the tiger?
- Well, not now.
- Mm-mm!
Here comes that bad-luck lady again.
Third time tonight.
- Here. Let me shuffle them.
- Wait a minute. Don't evade the issue.
- Yeah, speak up.
- I asked you a question.
- You did? I forgot.
- Oh, no, you didn't.
I asked you if there'd be as much sport in the game... if you were the tiger instead of the hunter.
- Come on.
- What's your answer now, Bob?
That's something
I'll never have to decide.
Listen here, you fellows.
This world's divided into two kinds of people... the hunter and the hunted.
Luckily, I'm a hunter.
Nothing can ever change that.
Hang on!
Hello! Hello, down there!
Hello, Engine Room!
- The panel is flooded!
- If the water hits those hot boilers...
Help!
Help!
You trying to drown me?
Where are the others?
See anybody?
Nobody left but us two and... that fella.
Doc! Help!
- Look!
- Shark!
Ohh! It got me!
Hello!
Is anybody here?
Anybody around, I say.
Oh, hello.
Is this your house?
I'm not trying to break in, but I've been in a wreck.
Our yacht just sunk with all hands.
I got ashore and found your place here by accident.
I'm not trying to intrude, but I'm in sort of a jam.
Don't you understand any English?
Lvan does not speak any language.
He has the misfortune to be dumb.
Oh, hello.
Are you the owner here?
Yes.
Welcome to my poor fortress.
- Fortress?
- It once was.
Built by the Portuguese, centuries ago.
I have had the ruins restored to make my home here.
I am Count Zaroff.
My name's Robert Rainsford.
Glad to meet you.
Very glad.
Lvan is a Cossack.
I am afraid, like all my fellow countrymen, he is a bit of a savage.
Smile, Ivan.
I was trying to make him understand there'd been a shipwreck in the channel.
But how appalling!
And you mean to say that you are the only survivor?
Yes, I'm afraid I am.
You're certain?
I'd have never left the spot if I hadn't been.
The swellest crowd on Earth... my best friends.
- It's incredible.
- Such things are always incredible.
Death is for others, not for ourselves.
That is how most of my other guests have felt.
Your other guests?
You mean this has happened before?
My fellow, we have several survivors from the last wreck still in the house.
It would seem that this island were cursed.
That's just what the captain said.
Only he thought it was uninhabited.
We Cossacks find our inspiration in solitude.
- Well, it's a break for me, anyway.
- My house is yours.
Oh, by the way. You'll want to change those wet rags immediately.
Yes. They look about the way I feel.
Yes.
I have some loose hunting clothes which I keep for my guests... that you can possibly get into.
Lvan will show you to your room.
- Thank you.
- You'll find a stiff drink there also.
Thanks a lot.
All pleasure is mine.
Come in.
- Ready, Rainsford?
- All set.
I'm afraid we have finished dinner.
But I have ordered something for you.
Thanks. I don't feel like eating, though.
Oh. Well, perhaps later.
Now, then, what do you say to coffee... and most charming company?
It is hard to forget your comrades' fate, I know... but our feminine guest is easily perturbed.
If I could beg you to put a good face upon the matter.
A- Assume a cheerfulness you may not feel.
- Why, sure. Of course.
- Thank you.
Miss Trowbridge, may I present
Mr. Robert Rainsford.
- Miss Eve Trowbridge.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- And her brother, Mr. Martin Trowbridge.
How are you, old chap?
Pretty well shaken up, I guess, huh?
- Coming out of it now, thanks.
- We know how it feels, don't we, Eve?
Indeed we do.
Perhaps Mr. Rainsford would like some hot coffee.
Oh, yes, of course.
Mr. Rainsford, please sit here.
Vodka, that's the stuff!
One shot'll dry you out quicker than all the coffee in Java.
Have to toss it off, though.
Like this.
Now, Martin, you don't have to drink it all tonight, do you?
Don't be ridiculous, sis.
We are victims of circumstance.
Same as Mr. Rainsford.
And if anyone has a right to his liquor, it's a victim of circumstance.
- Isn't that so, Count?
- Of course, yes.
- You were in a shipwreck too?
- Yes.
Our lifeboat was the only one saved... my brother and I and two sailors.
The count found us on the beach with nothing but the clothes on our backs.
Those channel lights must have been shifted.
- I wonder it hasn't been reported.
- Well, we'll report 'em... just as soon as we get back to the mainland.
You see, the count has only one launch... and that's under repair.
Russians are not the best mechanics.
I'm afraid we'll have to be patient a few days longer.
It's all right with me. I feel as if I were living on borrowed time right now.
Speaking of that, perhaps now you'll tell us... a little bit about who you are.
Just sketchily, you know... born, married, why I left my last job.
No, no, no, no.
One moment, please.
Mr. Rainsford need never explain who he is in my house.
We entertain a celebrity,
Miss Trowbridge.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Don't tell me. Let me guess.
I know. Flagpole sitter.
- I know. He wrote some books.
- No, he lived some books.
If I am not mistaken, this is Mr. Robert Rainsford... who hunts big game so adventurously.
Yeah? Here's to ya.
- I've lugged a gun around a little.
- "I've lugged a gun around a little. "
No, I have read your books.
I read all books on hunting.
- A papiroso?
- Thank you.
Only in yours have I found a sane point of view.
- What do you mean, "sane"?
- Cigarette?
- Hmm? Yeah. Thanks.
- You do not excuse what needs no excuse.
Let me see.
How did you put it?
"Hunting is as much a game as stud poker... only the limits are higher. "
- You have put our case perfectly.
- Then you're a hunter yourself?
We are kindred spirits.
It is my one passion.
He sleeps all day and hunts all night.
And what's more, Rainsford, he'll have you doing the same thing.
We'll have capital sport together,
I hope.
Don't encourage him.
He's had our two sailors so busy... chasing around the woods after flora and fauna... that we haven't seen them for three days.
But what do you hunt here?
I'll tell you.
You will be amused, I know.
I have done a rare thing.
I have invented a new sensation.
Yeah, and is he stingy with it.
What is this sensation, Count?
Mr. Rainsford,
God made some men poets.
Some He made kings, some beggars.
Me, He made a hunter.
My hand was made for the trigger, my father told me.
He was a very rich man... with a quarter of a million acres in the Crimea, and an ardent sportsman.
When I was only still up high he gave me my first gun.
- Good for him.
- My life has been one glorious hunt.
It would be impossible for me to tell you how many animals I have killed.
- But when the revolution...
- Look out.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Count Zaroff was so interesting...
I didn't realize the danger.
Oh, it's all right now. What were you saying about the revolution, Count?
Oh, merely that I escaped with most of my fortune.
Naturally, I continued to hunt all over the world.
It was in Africa that the Cape buffalo gave me this.
That must have been a close call.
Yes. It still bothers me sometimes.
However, in two months
I was on my way to the Amazon.
I'd heard that the jaguars there were unusually cunning.
No, no, no.
No sport at all.
Well, conditions are bad everywhere these days.
One night, as I lay in my tent with this... this head of mine... a terrible thought crept like a snake into my brain.
Hunting was beginning to bore me.
Is that such a terrible thought,
Count?
It is, my dear lady, when hunting has been the whip for all other passions.
When I lost my love of hunting...
I lost my love of life... of love.
Well, you seem to have stood it pretty well.
I even tried to sink myself to the level of the savage.
I made myself perfect in the use of the Tartar war bow.
Tartar which?
Tartar war bow...
That one up there.
It's cute.
Even to this day I prefer to hunt with it... but alas, even that was too deadly.
What I needed was not a new weapon... but a new animal.
- A new animal?
- Exactly so.
You found one?
Yes.
Here on my island...
I hunt the most dangerous game.
"The most dangerous game"?
You mean tigers?
Tigers?
No.
The tiger has nothing but his claws and his fangs.
I heard some queer beast howling back there along the water. Was that it?
It's no use, Rainsford.
He won't tell.
He won't even let you see his trophy room... till he gets ready to take you on a hunt of the great whatsit.
My one secret. I keep it as a surprise for my guests... against the rainy day of boredom.
You let me in on that game... and I'll bet you
I go for it.
You know, Rainsford, he hasn't failed yet.
If he says a thing is good, it is good.
He's a judge of liquor, wizard at contract... plays the piano... anything you want.
He's a good host and a good scholar, eh, Count?
Yes, yes.
You want me to go hunting?
You just say the word. We're pals.
We'll have a big party, get cockeyed and go hunting.
A completely civilized point of view.
I tell you what you do. You come to my place in the Adirondacks, see.
We'll have a private car, liquor and gals on the trip... and the guides will make the deers behave.
I think we'd better change the subject.
All right.
Change the subject.
Oh, I know!
Play the piano, huh?
If you wish.
Good idea. Play the piano.
Leave it to me, and I'll fix everything.
Perhaps the count doesn't want to play.
There you go, sis, throwing cold water.
Leave me alone.
I know where the piano is.
I'm perfectly sober.
Charming simplicity.
"Completely civilized," did you say?
He talks of wine and women as a prelude to the hunt.
We barbarians know that it is after the chase... and then only that man revels.
It does seem a bit like cocktails before breakfast.
Of course, yes. You know the saying of the Ugandi chieftains...
"Hunt first the enemy, then the woman. "
That's the savages' idea everywhere.
It is the natural instinct.
What is woman... even such a woman as this... until the blood is quickened by the kill?
- Oh, I don't know.
- "Oh, I don't know. "
You Americans.
One passion builds upon another.
Kill!
Then love.
When you have known that... you will have known ecstasy.
Oh, Martin!
Here you see Zaroff, the keyboard king... in his Branca Island hour.
Come on, Count.
Now, you show them.
- What do you suggest?
- Oh, just a good tune.
But not highbrow, like last night.
- Just a good tune, see?
- I see.
Oh, his hunting dogs.
Keep your voice low and listen.
It isn't true about the launch needing repairs.
I heard it leave the boathouse last night. It returned this morning.
You mean he's keeping you from returning to the mainland?
Yes.
Well, perhaps he enjoys the company of two very charming people.
Two, maybe.
There were four of us a week ago.
- The other two have disappeared.
- What do you mean?
One night after dinner, the count took one of our sailors... down to see his trophy room... at the foot of those stone steps.
- That iron door?
- Yes.
Two nights later he took the other there.
Neither has been seen since.
Have you asked him about them?
He says they've gone hunting.
Oh, be careful.
He's watching us.
Will you smile, as if I'd said something funny?
Now look here. You must be mistaken.
Not now.
Applaud.
- Attaboy! Attaboy!
- Thank you.
What did I tell you?
Smacks a mean ivory, eh, Rainsford?
It was splendid.
Don't stop, please.
I'm afraid we have failed to hold the full attention of our audience.
Well, I expect it's rather difficult for Mr. Rainsford... to concentrate on anything after all he's been through.
My dear lady, you are pleading for yourself.
I can see the drooping of those lovely eyes.
Excuse me.
You know, the count's worse than a family governess.
Every night he sends us off to bed like naughty children.
Oh, no, my dear. No.
Charming children.
There, you hear that, sis?
Now trot along upstairs and don't bother us grownups anymore.
Well, after that I guess...
I guess I'll have to go.
- Good night, Mr. Rainsford.
- Good night.
We'll be seeing each other at breakfast.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night, sis. We won't be seeing each other at breakfast.
Oh, my dear Rainsford,
I have been most inconsiderate.
You must be feeling the need of sleep too.
- Yes, I am just about all in.
- Then Ivan will show you to your room.
Oh, Martin, turn in early, please?
Don't worry. The count'll take care of me, all right.
Indeed I shall.
- Well, good night.
- Good night, sir.
Sleep well.
Oh, uh, well, here's to long life.
A long life.
Tell me, Mr. Trowbridge... are you also fatigued?
Tired? Me?
You know I'm not.
You know, Rainsford, we two are just alike.
Up all night and sleep all day.
Well, good night.
Well, what are we gonna do, huh?
What's the big idea?
I thought that perhaps... tonight you would like to see my trophy room?
Your trophy room?
I'm sure you will find it most... interesting.
Say, that's a great idea.
Ho-ho. Now we're pals.
No more secrets now, huh?
- We'll make a night of it.
- I hope so, Mr. Trowbridge.
Just you and I... pals.
We'll have fun together, huh?
Precisely, yes.
Fun together.
Attaboy, County, old boy, old boy, County.
Please let me come in.
I'm sorry to disturb you, but I'm frightened.
- What was it? Those dogs?
- My brother.
I've been listening for hours for him to come upstairs.
I've just gone to his room.
He isn't there!
- He's probably somewhere with the count.
- That's just what I'm afraid of.
Count Zaroff is planning something... about my brother and me.
You don't really think anything has happened to your brother?
Oh, I don't know, but we've got to find him.
Won't you help me?
Why, of course I'll help you.
- Where do you think he's gone?
- Where did the others go?
The iron door.
I'll meet you downstairs in five minutes.
Thank you.
That's queer.
It's unlocked.
Zaroff! He's coming down.
Back here, quick!
Where is my brother?
You killed him!
You killed my brother!
You!
Why, you...
Come, come, my dear Rainsford.
I don't want to treat you like my other guests.
You and I, we are hunters.
So that's your most dangerous game.
Yes. My dear fellow,
I intended to tell you last night... but you know, Miss Trowbridge...
You hunted him like an animal.
I know what you think, but you are wrong.
He was sober and fit for sport when I sent him out.
An hour or two strapped up in here brought him to his senses.
You raving maniac!
Yes, yes, yes. I'll take it off... when we've finished.
The stupid fellow tried to escape through the swamps of Fog Hollow.
You see, when I first began stocking my island... many of my guests thought I was joking... so I established this trophy room.
I always bring them here before the hunt.
An hour with my trophies... and they usually do their best to keep away from me.
Where do you get these poor devils?
Providence provided my island with dangerous reefs.
But there are light buoys to mark the safe channel.
They do not always mark it.
- You shifted them.
- Precisely right.
Too bad your yacht should have suffered... but at least it brought us together.
You take half-drowned men from ships you've wrecked... and drive them out to be hunted.
I give them every consideration... good food, exercise... everything to get them in splendid shape.
- To be shot down in cold blood.
- Oh, no, no.
Oh, I admit, with this annoying fellow... but usually I give them hunting clothes... a woodsman's knife and a full day's start.
I even wait until midnight to give them the full advantage the dark.
And if one eludes me only till sunrise... he wins the game.
Suppose he refuses to be hunted.
Ivan is such an artist with these.
Invariably, Mr. Rainsford, invariably they choose to hunt.
And when they win?
To date I have not lost.
Oh, Rainsford, you'll find this game worth playing.
When the next ship arrives, we'll have gorgeous sport together.
You murdering rat!
I'm a hunter not an assassin.
Come, Rainsford.
Say you will hunt with me.
Hunt men?
Say you will hunt with me!
No?
What do you think I am?
One, I fear, who dare not follow his own convictions... to their logical conclusion.
I'm afraid in this instance,
Mr. Rainsford... you may have to follow them.
What do you mean?
I shall not wait for the next ship.
Four o'clock.
The sun is just rising.
Come, Mr. Rainsford.
Let us not waste time.
Ivan.
Your fangs and claws,
Mr. Rainsford.
Bob! Bob!
Lvan.
Bob! Bob, what are they going to do?
- I'm going to be hunted.
- Oh, no. No, Miss Trowbridge.
Outdoor chess.
His brain against mine.
His good craft against mine.
- And the prize?
- The prize?
You may recall what I said last evening.
Only after the kill... does man know the true ecstasy of love.
Suppose you lose.
If I do not...
What shall I say?..
Find you... between midnight and sunrise tomorrow, freedom for both of you.
- I'm going with you.
- No. He'll kill you too.
Not at all.
One does not kill a female animal.
If you lose,
I can easily recapture her alive.
All right.
I'll take her with me then.
We'll set him a trail he'll remember.
It's only fair to advise you against Fog Hollow.
Outdoor chess, Mr. Rainsford.
Don't lose your nerve.
We'll beat this thing.
- The others didn't.
- We will.
Come on.
Let's get going.
It seems as though we've come miles.
Yeah, but three hours doesn't take you far in this jungle.
Come on.
Let's keep going.
Come on.
Just a little more of this, then easy downhill going.
We'll soon be safe.
No wonder he was so sure.
This island is no bigger than a deer park.
Oh, Bob!
Come on, now.
What are we going to do?
We didn't each live through a shipwreck to let this crazy man hunter worry us.
I shouldn't have come with you.
You might beat him if you were alone.
Alone? And leave you here with that savage?
Not a chance.
Now we've got to think of something to worry him.
You'd never get near him.
He'd shoot on sight.
Weapons aren't everything in the jungle.
Say, did you notice that leaning tree down there?
- The one we just passed?
- Yes. I want to show you something.
You see? If that supporting branch were cut away... this fallen tree would make a perfect
Malay deadfall.
A Malay deadfall? What's that?
A man-killing contraption the natives use.
It would stop that madman, all right.
Trouble is, it takes quite a few hours to build.
He said he wouldn't follow till midnight.
That's right. If you help me,
I think we'll have time.
Come on.
We'll cut some strong vines.
There. Almost ready.
This bracelet of yours makes a fine guide ring for my necktie.
He'll have been on his way almost an hour now.
Look out!
Don't touch that trip line.
You'll have a two-ton tree down on your back.
- Jungle wood's as heavy as iron.
- Will it really work?
I've never known a living thing to get by one yet.
Look here.
You touch that trip line... it'll pull that trigger free.
Once that's loose, there's nothing to keep the log from coming down.
It'll crash down and kill anything underneath it.
Look.
We're ready.
Let him come.
Give me that knife.
Come out, Rainsford.
Why prolong it?
I'll not bungle this shot.
You'll never even feel it.
But surely you don't think that anyone who has hunted leopards... would follow you into that ambush?
Oh, very well.
If you choose to play the leopard...
I shall hunt you like a leopard.
Wait. Maybe it's a trick.
Eve.
Why did he go?
He's playing with us... like a cat with a mouse.
What do you mean?
You heard him say he'd hunt us as he'd hunt a leopard.
That means he's gone for his high-powered rifle.
His rifle?
Oh, Bob, we must get away from here!
- Run, quick!
- Eve, wait.
- No, I tell you, no!
- Don't stop! No!
Wait. That's Fog Hollow ahead.
- Fog Hollow?
- The swamp where he caught the others.
We haven't a chance of keeping ahead of him there.
- But there's no place else to run.
- That's just what he's counting on.
We've got two hours till dawn. We've got to use our brains instead of our legs.
But he'll have his rifle.
And we'll have a man trap.
Look.
It makes me dizzy.
Cover this over.
When Mr. Zaroff falls down there, he'll be all through hunting.
Quick. Gather some leaves and grass.
I'll cut some branches.
Yes. Very good, Rainsford.
Very good.
You have not won yet.
Look at your watch.
Are you looking at it?
Still half an hour till sunrise.
Swamp or no swamp, we can keep ahead of him that long.
As you are doubtless saying, the odds are against me.
You have made my rifle useless in the fog.
You cannot blame me if I overcome that obstacle.
Those animals I cornered... now I know how they felt.
Achmed, Miss Trowbridge... bring her here.
Now!
My dear Rainsford,
I congratulate you.
You have beaten me.
Not yet.
Oh, but of course.
I insist.
Why, you're...
You're not even wounded.
You hit the dog not me.
I took a chance and went over with him.
A clever trick, Rainsford.
I cheerfully admit defeat.
Here's the key of the boathouse.
The door is in the trophy room.
You and Miss Trowbridge may leave at once.
No!
Ohh!
Bob!
Eve!
The boat! Quick!
Impossible.

I'm sorry, gentleman and lady, but it will be best for you to stay here tonight.
Come now, my good man.
You can't frighten us.
We've been over your foul roads before.
Please, you do not understand.
It is not the road.
It is the darkness.
Here our doors are protected with bat thorns.
What is all this bat Thorn business?
It keeps them out.
They're afraid of it-- the demons of the castle.
[Knocking]
[Knocking furiously]
Oh, uh, good evening.
It's a lovely even...Ing.
Ahem.
Well, doctor, for one who is not afraid of the dark, you have been pushing your horse pretty fast.
Well, you know horses.
Once they get started for home, there's no stopping them.
Oh, I admit, I was a bit impatient--
I mean, hungry--for one of your wonderful meals.
Yes. The vampires are hungry, too, for their supper.
Oh! Tut-tut.
Nonsense. Rubbish.
Vampires. Nonsense.
I won't keep you waiting.
I'll be right out for my supper.
He can tut-tut all he likes about vampires, but I'd hate to be on a farm needing his help tonight.
What is all this about vampires?
Yes, and this castle?
That's where they live-- in their coffins, and they come out at night and drink people's blood.
Ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Silly superstition.
You would not laugh if you lived in these mountains.
Fancy, Ronny, vampires in the 20th century.
Ripping. They'll never believe that at the club.
[Speaking foreign language]
She says please do not mock because if the vampires should hear you, they will take their revenge on all of us.
[Speaking foreign language]
Woman: Did you find out what was the matter?
Man: Baron Otto is coming.
Baron Otto: One minute.
I have something to say to you.
I'm the bearer of very sad tidings.
Last night your master, sir karell, was murdered.
[Servants murmur]
There's no cause for alarm.
Get up on your feet.
Police inspector neumann from Prague is upstairs now with the body.
He'll be down here shortly to question all of you.
Now, tell him the truth, and nothing can happen to you.
That's all. You can go back to your work.
In the university of Prague, there are records, documents that prove the existence of these creatures.
Dr. Doskil, I'm not interested in your old wives' tales.
I'm trying to find the cause of sir karell's death.
But you have it right here-- these little wounds on his throat are the bite of the vampire.
Jan, you said--
I have seen such marks in these parts.
Sir karell dismissed you at 9:15 last night.
Yes, Mr. Inspector.
Yes.
Then what were you doing down here this morning at 3:30?
I don't know.
I couldn't sleep.
A bat was fluttering against my window, and I felt something was wrong.
A bat made you feel that way?
Yes, sir--no, sir.
I don't know.
Now, you...
Why didn't you come to the castle at once when jan telephoned?
Because jan told me sir karell was already dead.
Does your medical license admit jan to certify to the death of your patients?
No, no.
Of course not.
But it was night, and I realized there was nothing I could do.
Oh, I see. You're no moonflower.
You're a morning glory.
Now, if there's enough daylight to bring out the physician in you, make a thorough examination of the body for the cause of death-- real, not supernatural.
Here, jan, give the doctor a hand.
[Softly]
Why, the idea!
I'll get your wrap, my dear.
We'll step over to my place.
You've eaten nothing.
Oh, the very thought of food. I couldn't.
But, irena, you must conserve your strength.
Man: Yoo-hoo!
It's fedor.
I'll tell him.
No. No, thanks.
Fedor: Yoo-hoo!
Yoo-hoo!
Oh! Where have you been?
I've been making enough noise to raise the dead.
Oh, don't, fedor.
Don't.
Well, what's wrong, dear?
What's happened?
Fedor, father...
Father!
Oh, you poor darling.
This young man, tell me something about him.
Who? Fedor?
Miss borotyn's fiance,
Mr. Vincenty from Prague.
His family--wealthy?
Moderately. Why?
With sir karell out of the way, miss borotyn will come into quite a bit of money.
Surely you can't suspect fedor.
What are miss borotyn's immediate plans?
Why, naturally she'll be moving next-door to my place,
I being her guardian.
Oh. Her guardian.
Why, yes.
And being her guardian, naturally you'll be the sole executor of her estate.
Yes. Why?
What's wrong?
Oh, I see.
I'm under suspicion, too.
In such cases, everyone's under suspicion.
The idea of talking to me as though I were one of his common policemen!
Old wives' tales!
Look for the cause of death-- real, not supernatural.
Why...
Aah! What?
Look!
Well, doctor.
What have you found?
Inspector, the examination fully confirms my diagnosis.
Those marks are the only sign of violence.
Had sir karell been ailing of late?
No. On the contrary, he enjoyed good health, except for a slightly sluggish heart.
You prescribed for that?
Naturally.
Ah. Well, I shall want an autopsy.
Of course that will be done, but I am positive the cause of his death is told by those little wounds.
Surely, doctor, a man of your learning does not believe in vampires.
Then how do you account for his body being drained dry of blood?
Yes, Mr. Coroner, and tonight farmer narotni was found dead in the road.
Count mora and his daughter were seen again near the castle.
Oh. Piffle!
Superstitious twaddle!
Dr. Doskil.
Yes.
You have examined the body of this farmer, too.
I did. Ahem.
The corpse was drained of blood.
There were the same marks that I found on sir karell's throat.
And you have seen this count mora and his daughter?
No, sir.
When I saw them, they was in form of bats.
These poor, deluded creatures believe that vampires change themselves into bats and back again into human form.
How versatile.
Really, Mr. Coroner.
"Poor, deluded creatures."
Oh, I must protest.
I hold a degree from the medical faculty sit down.
Of the univers-- do you want to make your township and this court ridiculous?
Forget your absurd old superstitions.
This is 1934.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I think that under existing circumstances, the decision of this inquest must be that sir karell borotyn met his death from cause or causes unknown.
[Women singing]
Darling, they're doing all this for you.
Doesn't it make you happy?
Why...
Why, dear, you're crying.
Bars, please drive on.
I'm sorry, dear.
I didn't mean to make you sad.
Forgive me, fedor, for being so moody, but seeing them all dancing suddenly brought it all back...
How father used to tell me that at my wedding feast, all the villagers and peasants from miles around would come, and they'd sing and dance.
Oh, fedor...
He had it all planned.
Now he isn't here.
Darling, I'll always try to make you as happy as your father wanted you to be.
The villagers and peasants would be quite satisfied with wine of the country.
It is just what sir karell would have done.
Yes, sir, but for one thing.
What's that?
He would have had the wedding feast at the castle.
Come, jan.
Do you think miss irena could bear to go back there after that dreadful tragedy?
I suppose not, sir, but it's heartbreaking to see the place neglected, rain and sleet entering through the broken windows.
I know how you feel.
Recheck your list.
Be sure we've got enough of everything.
But you must remember, life goes on, my dear.
Your father wouldn't want these days of all days to be clouded for you.
I know. I feel ashamed of the way I acted with fedor last night, but it all seemed to sweep over me again.
Well, no more of that, young lady.
If I remember correctly, we have a wedding to prepare for.
Irena: Fedor!
Fedor! Oh, darling, what's the matter?
Annie, some water, quick!
What is it, fedor?
What happened to you?
I don't know.
I can't remember.
I was running to the train, and then by the castle
I fell.
I...i must have struck my head.
Oh, you poor dear.
Here. Drink this.
Fedor, you say you fell by the castle?
When I came to, it was dawn.
I was too weak to move.
I just lay there.
It seems...
It seemed hours before I was able to...
To drag myself here.
Irena: Annie, the doctor, quick.
Dr. Doskil.
Fedor, those wounds-- like father's!
Annie: Aah! Vampires! Vampires!
Let me out of here!
[Soft, ghostly moaning]
[Bats squeaking]
Man: Hyah!
Hyah!
Woman:
Aah! Slow down!
Slower!
Are you trying to kill me?
Let go. Let go.
Slow down! Slow down!
I'm not going to be upset in no ditch!
And I'm going to tell the baron how you've been beating his horse.
It's all your fault, taking so much time over your beer.
I told you we had to get home before sunset.
Why afraid of the dark?
The darkness won't hurt us.
If you wake up dead in the morning your body drained dry of blood, you'd be afraid of the dark.
Afraid of the dark.
[Woman screams]
Oh! Oh!
Heaven--heaven protect us!
Oh, heaven!
I've been a good girl.
I've been a good girl all my life.
Don't let her get me.
[Branch cracks]
Aah!
Giddy-up!
Woman: We must see him.
Jan: But you can't disturb him now.
Woman: He must be told what we saw!
Jan: Once and for all, you cannot disturb him now!
What is this?!
The castle, sir!
It's haunted, sir!
Dead people.
Shh! Jan, close the door.
We saw them.
Yes, we did, sir.
Keep quiet.
I'll explain.
Some real-estate brokers from Prague-- no, no. We saw a woman, a dead woman in her grave clothes.
That's enough.
What you probably saw was one of the brokers' clients inspecting the castle.
The place is being shown for rent.
Excuse me, sir.
I'm new here.
Otto: I want no more disturbances in this house, understand?
Yes, sir.
Miss irena has gone through enough excitement.
No, sir. Yes, sir.
I'll keep my tongue.
[Clock striking]
[Woman screams]
Jan: What is it?
What is it, sir?
[Woman screams]
[Screaming]
Otto: What happened to her?
Woman: I don't know.
I couldn't find her.
What happened?
I don't know!
I felt her deadly cold breath on my throat.
I must have fainted.
I knew no more.
Colleague, your diagnosis is correct.
Professor zelen.
Gentlemen, I've spent my life in the study of, uh...
Uh, miss borotyn, will you excuse us, please?
May we continue our talk in another room?
Maid.
Yes, sir? Yes, sir?
Go to miss borotyn.
Stay with her.
Under no circumstances leave her.
No, sir.
Professor zelen, why all this secrecy?
I broke off my sentence for miss borotyn's sake.
There is no more foul or relentless enemy of man in the occult world than this dead-alive creature spewed up from the grave.
True, true.
This attack by a beautiful woman on miss borotyn goes far to confirm the legend of the castle.
Who else could it have been but-- the daughter of count mora.
Exactly.
My very own conclusion, professor.
What is your advice?
We can't undo what's been done.
Miss borotyn is in danger of repeated attacks.
[Knock on door]
[Knocking]
Come in, please.
It's inspector neumann.
Excuse me.
Uh, baron Otto, I must speak to inspector neumann before he leaves.
Maid: Please. You should be lying down.
Miss borotyn! [Gasp]
You must come away from there.
I'm afraid you treat me like an invalid.
Maid, quick, the doors. The windows.
I want everything closed and fastened securely.
Every moment counts.
Run along, now.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Oh, Dr. Doskil.
There's a certain thorny weed that grows in these parts.
Yes, yes.
Bat Thorn.
That's it.
That's it.
I want you to get me some, if you will, please.
We'll have to work fast.
The sun will soon be down.
Yes.
Very good, sir.
With my permission, a broker in Prague leased the castle.
Look. Look at the signature of the tenant.
Karell borotyn. Hmm.
Some relative, no doubt.
No, no.
It's karell himself.
What's wrong with you, man?
Sir karell's been dead for a year.
It's his signature,
I tell you. I know it as well as my own.
Zelen: Ah, inspector neumann!
Your arrival is providential.
Baron, we need his help in the worst way.
Inspector, miss borotyn has been attacked by a vampire.
Well, I suppose coming from you this is no joke.
But you know
I don't believe in such things.
Why have you sent for me?
Why were you instrumental in bringing me down here?
Please, professor.
No argument.
I can't stand any more of this.
I'm too excited.
I beg your pardon, baron.
Sorry, baron.
I'll tell you why
I brought you here, professor.
I thought you'd help me uncover the truth.
Why, the facts speak for themselves.
There have been
3 attacks.
Sir karell is dead.
Miss borotyn and her fiance lie within the shadow of worse than death.
The vampire is a pestilence that grows.
Each victim that it kills itself becomes a vampire.
A corpse by day, at night it leaves its coffin to sustain its unnatural life on the blood of the living.
Inspector, we must protect this house with bat Thorn to prevent their entrance.
Baron, I have sent for a supply.
If you will pardon me,
I'll see if it's arrived.
Inspector, do you really think-- zelen: Miss borotyn, you should not be down here.
You must not disregard my warnings.
But I heard a voice...
Outside, calling me.
It's your weakened condition, child.
No. No, it sounded like father.
Father's voice.
Come. I'll take you back to your room.
Did you hear what she said?
Her father's voice.
Hysteria.
I place no stock in it.
His signature...
His signature on that lease.
Now, don't you start believing that nonsense.
Dead people don't leave their graves.
But, inspector, we must make sure that sir karell's body is still in its coffin.
Irena: Fedor, you're not well enough. You promised me not to come tonight.
Fedor: What are you trying to keep from me?
Who is this man?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Professor zelen.
Professor,
Mr. Vincenty.
You've been so ill, dear, we thought it best not to let you know, but now that you're here-- please, please.
You'll overtax your strength.
Mr. Vincenty, miss borotyn must be spared all excitement.
She's passed through a terrible ordeal.
Like you, she was attacked by the vampire.
The vampire?!
Zelen:
She must have rest.
Fedor: She'll get rest.
I'm taking her away from here tonight--now.
Mr. Vincenty, if you interfere with my plans, if you disobey me, my work will be destroyed, for...it's not only your lives, your souls are at stake.
We must all die.
There's nothing terrible about death.
But to live on after death, a soul earthbound-- a vampire-- you don't wish any such fate for your beloved.
Fedor: No.
Of course not.
Of course not.
Then you must leave with me.
I'm not leaving here.
Please, dear.
Do as he says.
I'm so tired.
Good night.
Zelen: Maid! Maid!
Come here, please.
Yes, sir? Yes, sir?
I want you and the Butler to place some of this bat Thorn in every room on this floor, you understand?
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Go along.
Come, young man.
Aah! Don't do that.
He wants some of this put in every room in the house.
Yes. You.
No. We.
The vampire's power prevails during the hours between sunset and sunrise, when it leaves its coffin--
[door opens]
Otto: Professor...
We've just come from sir karell's tomb.
Inspector:
The coffin was empty.
[Jan babbling]
[Maid screaming]
[Banging on door]
Aah!
Fedor:
Irena! Irena!
Fedor! Fedor!
Fedor: Darling, what happened?
Irena: Oh, my dear!
Stop gibbering.
What are you trying to say?
Maid: It was terrible!
It was awful!
Zelen: Quiet, please.
One at a time.
Speak up.
Tell me what happened.
Yes. We were told to put some of the bat Thorn in every room.
We'd just come out of that door and started down the hall...
It's a horrible business.
I wish he'd hung the beastly stuff up himself.
We'll get it over with--
[Maid screams]
H-he was there, coming towards us!
Yes, yes! He had a white face...
A dead-white face with burning eyes and a ghastly wound on his head.
Zelen: It was count mora.
Yes! Yes!
Have you been drinking?
No. No, sir.
If I have,
I hope to choke on the next one.
This is no time for levity.
The vampire, he is still somewhere within this house.
Young man, place some bat Thorn at this door and lock it securely.
Fedor: Yes, sir.
Maid, Butler, search the rooms at that end of the house.
You mean...
G-go into those rooms?
Zelen:
Yes, you idiot!
Inspector: Hurry!
Baron Otto, we must drive him out of here.
Quick, inspector, we must search the rooms at this end.
Zelen: In that room, baron.
Quick, inspector.
We've no time to lose.
[Gunshot]
Jan: Maria, don't leave me!
[Gunshot]
Otto: Inspector, what is it?
He got through the window.
Zelen: Baron! Inspector!
Come here.
Please. Quick.
Inspector: What is it, professor?
What is it?
Zelen: Look.
Was that he...
The last one?
Who?
Sir karell-- her father.
Her father?
Why, yes.
Didn't you find his coffin empty?
No, no. I can't believe that.
I won't believe that.
Inspector, please hurry.
Place this at these doors.
I'll attend to the others.
Otto: Professor.
Baron, a moment.
Baron, there are things going on in this house that I don't like.
What do you mean?
This weed. The way the professor's acting.
I don't like it.
And I'm bewildered.
I no longer know what to think.
Irena: I'm afraid, fedor...
Afraid to close my eyes.
Fedor: There's nothing to be afraid of.
We'll be here with you watching over you.
No, no, no.
We must go.
We can't remain here.
She must have quiet.
She must have sleep.
Her exhausted body demands it.
Miss borotyn, the maid will be here with you.
But I dread every moment between now and morning.
Dismiss all fear from your mind.
The room is quite safe now.
[Bats squeaking]
[Somber organ music playing]
The organ.
That music. He was always at the organ.
Sounds like it comes from the dead.
This window.
It's sir karell.
Are you sure?
Are you sure it's sir karell?
Yes.
Midnight will soon be spent and nothing accomplished.
Are we going to sit here and think, or are we going to do something?
Incredible.
Incredible.
Inspector: Oh!
If sir karell--
I still maintain miss borotyn's the only one who can influence her father.
Are you mad?
Good heavens, no!
Can't you understand?
She mustn't even know her father's there.
Of course not!
Vampires or no vampires,
I'm going to-- what are you going to do?
Call headquarters for help.
Yes. Surround the place.
Set fire to it.
Fire.
An army of police, a hurricane of bullets would do no good.
You seem to forget that during the hours of darkness, the vampire can't even be harmed, let alone destroyed.
If they can't be destroyed, then we're wasting time.
I didn't say they couldn't be destroyed.
They can.
By day, the vampires must return to the ground in which they were buried-- or else find shelter in some accursed retreat.
It is then they are powerless.
Otto: Then we must leave at daybreak.
It's our chance to get away from here.
What? And leave these monsters here to continue their work of destruction?
It would be cowardice.
Inspector:
What else is there to do?
Search for them.
Find their corpselike bodies.
It is in that state, and that state only, they can be destroyed.
Their heads must be severed with one clean stroke and a sprig of bat Thorn placed within the gaping wound.
Otto: We would be crazy to attempt what you're planning.
I'll never do it.
Never.
In the morning, we're leaving.
I agree with you.
Yes? Yes.
In 3 hours, it will be daylight.
Oh, thank heaven the house is well-protected for the night.
Come, gentlemen, let's go to bed and get some rest.
[Door closes]
I had gone to bed as you said.
I laid here for hours trying to go to sleep, but I was restless.
I couldn't.
Then I heard Maria leave the room.
Why did you leave the room?
You had your orders.
To get some coffee to keep me awake.
Ah, you fool.
But after Maria left the room, then what happened?
I heard a sound, like wind at the casement.
I felt a draft.
Then I saw her, just as she was on the terrace.
I fought to keep my eyes open, but they closed.
I felt again that deadly cold breath.
The horror of it...
Made me feel faint.
There, there, my child.
That young man-- go to him. Hurry.
That cross
I told you to wear.
Maid, get it immediately.
Put it about her neck.
Wake up!
Come on!
What? What's the matter?
What's wrong?
Fedor, are you all right?
Something's wrong. Irena!
What's happened to her?
Mr. Vincenty, quiet, please.
Fedor, irena, she's been-- zelen: Shh!
Miss borotyn is asleep.
Quick, inspector, close that door, please.
Fedor: W-why are you here?
We've been watching through the night, but now the dawn is here.
We wanted to be sure that you were safe before we retired.
I--i feel drowsy.
I must have fallen sound asleep.
Sound? You were in a stupor.
We had to shake you.
Stupor?
Tell me.
Uh, this deep sleep, did it refresh you?
Why, yes.
Why do you ask?
What are you doing?
I just wanted to look at the wounds on your neck.
That deep sleep was unnatural.
Fortunately, he wasn't harmed.
When the maid screamed out to us, it must have frightened the monster away.
Gentlemen, we must face the truth, the horrible truth.
Miss borotyn is in their power.
To save her, we must break the spell.
If we don't succeed in destroying those monsters by sundown, we may be too late.
Quick, get into your clothes.
Come, baron!
Otto: Professor?
Inspector:
Professor zelen.
Uh, in here, inspector!
Have you searched thoroughly above?
Yes.
Not so much as a Mark on the dust-covered floor.
It's the same over there at the organ, where you saw sir karell playing.
The dust lies thick and undisturbed.
That's what makes it so difficult to find the vampire's hiding place.
Well, don't let's stand here talking.
Let's go on looking for them.
You're quite right, inspector.
Have you some matches?
Here.
Oh, look.
No, no, no, no, no!
Up there on the rod.
[Squeaking]
Stop, you fool!
Would you destroy what might give us a clue?
Inspector: Smash it!
Take no chances.
No, that would do no good.
It's only in its own corpselike state that it can be destroyed.
Now...
We must search the vaults beneath the old ruins.
Come. We have not much time left before sunset.
You have the matches, inspector?
Yes, professor.
[Animal squeaking]
[Squeaking]
[Door closing]
[Squeaking]
Professor zelen, are you all right?
Otto: Professor!
Professor zelen!
Here. Please, hurry!
Quick, inspector.
Get the candle.
We must find the others.
No, no. Don't leave!
Destroy him first!
Inspector: Drop it!
Zelen: Have you gone mad?
One more stupid act, and we'll be lost!
Otto: Please! Please don't leave him like this.
And expose ourselves to the vengeance of the others?
Why, their fury would follow us to the ends of the earth.
No. We must destroy them all together.
Come.
Inspector, put a Mark on that door so we'll know his hiding place.
Ah!
Oh, quick. Matches.
Inspector:
Right here.
Zelen: Ugh!
We'll be trapped in here. Hurry!
The sun is going down.
I'm staying here until you come with me.
I won't leave you.
Fedor, you must go.
If you love me, please do as I ask.
Inspector!
Inspector!
Ah! The fool!
Oh, fedor, we're being silly.
Don't let's argue, darling.
We'll just forget all about it.
Now, you run along downstairs.
I want to get out of this negligee.
I haven't had a dress on for ages.
Irena, i--i don't understand you.
Silly boy.
What's wrong?
Last night you were terrified, and tonight you're...You're gay and cheerful.
Are you sorry because I'm happy?
[Knock on door]
Yes? Come in.
Maid: Those doors! Those doors!
They shouldn't be open.
They should be closed.
The bat Thorn!
Oh, miss, you know the professor said that you-- go away, Maria.
Leave us alone.
Fedor:
It's all right,
Maria. You can go.
I'm with her.
Maria: But, mister-- fedor:
Run along.
What's the matter with everyone, worrying about a silly weed?
Irena, I've got to know why you're acting like this.
What are you hiding from me?
Don't ask me, please.
But I have a right to know.
There's something wrong with you.
You're not yourself.
Irena...
Look at me.
Irena, I...I feel that I'm losing you.
Fedor, forgive me.
Forgive me for what I'm doing.
Darling, tell me.
Tell me.
Fedor, I...
No, no. No! No!
Irena!
Irena!
Irena!
Inspector neumann!
Zelen:
Inspector neumann!
Be brave, my child.
I'll try.
Man: Then go with Luna.
[Somber organ music playing]
Otto: No, no!
Don't go up.
But don't you see, if sir karell was, in life, the kindly, benevolent person you describe-- your lifelong and devoted friend-- you could go to him.
You could appeal to him.
No, no. I can't!
[Glass shatters]
[Hiss]
Irena: Go away, fedor!
Go away! Go away!
Fedor: Irena!
Irena!
Ahh!
Everything is getting cloudy.
Getting cloudy.
You understand?
Getting cloudy.
You're going upstairs.
You understand?
You're going upstairs.
No, no!
I can't do it.
But, miss borotyn.
I can't go on!
But you must.
You wouldn't fail us now.
Inspector:
Miss borotyn!
Inspector.
Inspector neumann.
I can't go through with it.
He looks so much like father-- even his voice.
I've been willing to do all the other things you've asked of me, but this...This is more than I can endure.
But don't you see this is our last chance?
Everything else has failed.
But you both said baron Otto would break down and confess if we confronted him with this gentleman pretending to be my father.
I know.
We all thought our vampire scheme was so simple, so certain of success.
We never thought we'd fail.
I'm sorry.
But, miss borotyn.
After the attack on Mr. Vincenty, it was you who first suspected the baron of the crime.
We're positive you are right, but we lack definite proof.
If you fail us now, we will never know.
But to live through those moments again, to act as if you were my father alive and with me.
Don't you see the horror of it?
It's one year ago.
One year ago.
You understand?
One year ago.
You're going to see sir karell.
You understand?
You're going to see sir karell.
[Door opens]
Miss borotyn, get ready.
Baron Otto will be here any moment.
I'm afraid you can't count on me.
Oh, no, no, no, my dear child.
You must be courageous.
I admit what we're trying to do is only an experiment, but I feel certain now that we have the baron hypnotized, he will reenact his crime if he's guilty.
Jan: Baron Otto's at the door, sir.
Zelen: Oh, please.
Without you we're helpless.
I'll do my best.
Inspector.
Jan, I want you to do exactly as you did the night of the murder.
You understand?
Omit nothing.
Let him in.
[Organ playing]
Good evening, jan.
Good evening, baron.
How is your rheumatism?
It's gone, sir, thanks to the fine weather we're having.
Otto: That's good.
Now we'll soon know if my theory is correct.
I hope you're right.
I'm anxious to know how he drained that body of its blood.
Irena,
I've never seen you more lovely.
Irena: Thank you, dear baron.
No, karell,
I'm only staying a moment.
It will do me good to stop for a smoke.
Speaking of smoke, that reminds me.
Those pipes I ordered from London have come.
Yes, they came this afternoon, and they are beautiful.
Now...
Any 3 of them are yours.
3? I'll be satisfied with 1.
That's like the one you gave me
2 years ago.
Now, father, don't work too late, and don't forget your medicine.
I won't.
She knows you, karell.
I know you both.
Good night, father.
Good night.
Good night, baron.
Put it here on the desk, jan.
Jan, 3 drops of this in a glass of water.
Now, what about the third one?
There, there, there.
Now...
Karell, I was surprised when irena told me this afternoon.
I thought you weren't going to consent to a marriage to that boy.
Now, if I weren't here, you'd be her guardian.
What would you have done?
I would have said no.
I never would have given my consent.
I've always hoped that we had other plans.
What do you mean,
"other plans"?
Well...
That she would marry someone more worthy of her, someone nearer her station in life who could give her what she's accustomed to.
Why, you know she'll always have more than enough.
Haven't I arranged for that?
How soon is the wedding?
Within a fortnight.
A fortnight?
Karell, will you let me have irena's
Ruby necklace?
There may be time to have bracelet and earrings made to match.
And you would have said no?
Why, you...
You've spoiled her since the day she was born.
Jan, help me here.
Now, where did I put that...
Ah!
There it is, my good friend.
Thanks, karell.
I've been keeping you from your work long enough.
No. I'm glad you came over.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night, jan.
Good night, sir.
Quick, get through one of those rooms and watch the window on the terrace.
Well?
He thinks he's drugged your wine.
I know. I saw him.
Jan, come here.
Tell me, did sir karell drink the wine before he dismissed you?
Uh...no.
No, sir.
You're positive?
Quite.
Drink it, collapse, and then we'll see what happens.
All right.
Put these pipes in my room, jan.
I don't think I'll be wanting anything more tonight.
Very good, sir.
Good night, sir.
Good night.
Inspector: Cut!
Don't move, baron!
Zelen:
Look at me. Look me in the eye, baron.
That's it.
Everything is getting cloudy.
Cloudy.
You understand?
You are returning...
Returning to the present.
You understand?
You are returning...
To the present.
Zelen: Baron Otto, you're under arrest for the murder of sir karell borotyn.
You were very clever in concealing the motive of your crime.
We never dreamt it was miss borotyn you were after.
Franz, take him out to the car.
I don't get the idea of his heating the glass.
Why, to cup him with.
To cup him of his blood.
That hot glass over the wound creates a powerful suction.
Hmm.
Forgive me, fedor, but they wouldn't let me tell you.
They were afraid that you wouldn't let me go through with it.
This vampire business, it has given me a great idea for a new act.
Luna, in the new act,
I will be the vampire.
Did you watch me?
I gave all of me.
I was greater than any real vampire.
Luna: Sure, sure.
But get off your makeup.
Yes, and help me with some of this packing.
Good night, good night.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
That I shall say good night til it be 'morrow.
Good night, good night.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
That I shall say good night til it be 'morrow.
Good night...
Good night!
Help! Help!
Murder! Police!
Help!
Mr. Stevens!
Peters, help!
Help! Help!
Help!
Help!
Help! It's after me!
Help! Help!
Please, help!
Help! It's after me!
Help!
Mr. Stevens! Mr. Peters!
Stevens!
Mr. Stevens!
Help!
Help!
Please!
Help!
Help!
Well, Kitty, what is all this racket about?
Peters! Oh, Peters! I saw 'em! I saw 'em!
He's here in this house! He almost killed me!
The Gorilla! The Gorilla!
- It was awful! He'd've gotten ahold of...
- Be quiet!
- You have been dreaming.
- Oh, no!
- What's that?
- I don't know. I tell you, I don't know anything!
Call the police! Call Mr. Stevens!
He'll kill somebody!
- Be quiet, can't you!
- No, I can't!
I can't stay here or we'll all be murdered!
Mr. Stevens! Mr. Stevens!
- Were you calling me, Kitty?
- Oh, Mr. Stevens!
We'll all be murdered in our beds!
It's that gorilla fellow the papers are so full of!
The killer! He was just up in my room!
Why, now, come, Kitty, you're hysterical!
Oh, no, sir, I ain't hysterical! I've seen him like I said, sir!
Oh, Kitty, you're imagining things. Just you go back to bed.
That's what I said, sir, only there is this.
The Gorilla's paw.
Shall I call the police, sir?
The police? Yes, yes, call them right away.
Just a minute.
I'll handle this my own way.
- Yes, sir. Only...
- Only what?
You're thinking of the time, sir.
The time?
According to the newspapers, the Gorilla gives his victim only twenty-four hours notice.
Oh, nonsense!
Now you go back to bed and don't worry about this.
- Back to bed? Who, me?
- Or don't go back to bed. I'm not particularly interested in where you go.
- Oh, but, Mr. Stevens!
- Kitty...
- Yes, but...
- I...
Hello?
Oh, now, come please...
Just a minute.
That'll be all.
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah, but...
I wouldn't be frightened like that if I were you, Kitty.
Look, you be frightened any way you want.
This is my way.
Hello?
I begged you not to telephone me here.
Yes, I know I promised, but...
You gave me until Monday.
Saturday?
Tomorrow?
That's impossible!
I can't possibly raise that amount of money.
Yes, I know I owe it to you, but..
A quarter of a million dollars?
Look, please, now...
Oh, please be patient.
I have a plan.
But it's only just started.
Give me time to work it out and I'll repay you dollar for dollar.
Hello?
I want to send a radiogram, please.
To whom is the radiogram going, please?
Ms. Norma Denby.
'D' as in 'Denver'.
Aboard the S.S. Paris.
'Regret unable to meet you at boat. '
'Mightily important that I see you at my home, tomorrow evening, without fail. '
Sign it, 'Fondly, Uncle Walter. '
Read that back please.
I'm Norma Denby.
Mr. Stevens is expecting you, Ms. Denby.
- May I take your coat?
- No, thank you. I'll keep it on.
Nice cozy little place your uncle has here.
He likes it.
He'd have to live in it.
This way, please.
Well, well, well! If it isn't the prodigal niece!
Oh, it's swell seeing you again, darling.
And good to see you again, too, dear.
I took the liberty of bringing along my accomplice.
- Good, I'm glad you did.
- This is Jack, Uncle Walter.
This niece of mine isn't much of a correspondent.
But the few letters she did write, they were full of you!
Congratulations, young man.
Thank you, and I hope you'll excuse me for barging in like this.
Nonsense, I'm delighted.
I was more than pleasantly surprised to hear that you set your marriage for June.
Do you realize it's only a month away?
Well, we decided we didn't wanna rush things too much, so...
- So we put it off until...
- The day after tomorrow.
The day after tomorrow?
Does it startle you?
Why... Why, no, no, that's fine.
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about.
But I'm forgetting my role as host.
Sit down, my dear, sit down.
We may as well come to the point...
- Perhaps you'd rather talk to Norma alone, Mr. Stevens.
- Oh, no, no.
No, not at all. As Norma's future husband, what I have to say concerns you, too.
Now, as Norma knows, she and I were named joint heirs under the terms of her father's will.
And until she marries, I'm the executer of her estate.
But should anything happen to either of us...
Why, then, the survivor is the head of the entire estate.
And I think that you, Norma, and you, Jack, as her future husband...
...should know of what that estate consists.
To that end, I have prepared a record of your estate's holdings.
And I want to talk it over with you both after dinner.
But your radiogram said there was something urgent.
Well, if it hadn't been urgent, I wouldn't have sent it.
Well, something's worrying you. What is it, Uncle Walter?
Well, perhaps I'm unduly alarmed, but...
Last night, I received this note of warning.
From the Gorilla.
The Gorilla?
You mean that murderer, the ones the papers have been so full of?
I do.
Well, isn't it possible that this is all just a joke, that someone's playing a prank on you?
I wish I could think so.
But, Uncle Walter, why should he or anyone want to kill you?
I don't know.
Oh, it's possible some old enemy of mine...
I bet I made enemies in my day...
It's possible that one of them in a spurt of revenge has hired this maniac...
...this professional killer, or whatever the Gorilla is.
But this note is exactly like the one that was in the newspapers.
After he murdered that widow.
Still, I can't bring myself to believe it.
Of course, you've notified the police?
No, I haven't.
- But, surely, if there was anything in all this...
- I'm taking other precautions.
Peters and I are armed, and in addition, I've engaged the services of a private detective agency.
Their operative should be here any moment now.
Well, obviously, this Gorilla is no ordinary murderer at all.
And judging by his past, shall we say, successes...
It is apparent the workings of the police were a load of bullock to him.
Of course there's a slim chance that, by not notifying the police, we might upset his plans.
Ordinarily, I'm not easily frightened, but...
I must admit this whole affair's giving me the creeps.
Well, it's nearly nine o'clock.
Now suppose you freshen up a bit.
We'll talk it over after dinner.
Oh, Kitty, show Denby to the green room, and Mr. Marsden to my room.
- Yes, sir.
- Don't worry, Uncle Walter.
Oh, excuse me, Mr. Stevens.
- Yes, Kitty?
- Oh, I know it's customary to give notice...
Why, Kitty, you're not trying to tell me you're going to leave me?
Oh, no, sir. I'm trying to tell you I have left you.
But, Kitty, you're perfectly safe here!
Besides, we have guests. You haven't the heart to leave me now!
Well, my heart is willing, but I'm gonna have an awful time trying to convince the rest of my body.
I'll bet there's a dead body in every room.
Dead body won't hurt you.
Can't do you any good.
Well? What are we waiting for?
Let's go.
- Who did it?
- You!
- Who's with it tonight, chief?
- Make a note, then.
Keep doing it every once in a while.
It keeps me on edge and thinking.
Right.
Now what do you suppose they want detectives for?
I've got an idea. Let's go in and find out.
You're terrific.
By George, it's Peters!
- Who are you?
- Me?
- Why, I'm Peters, sir.
- Nevermind that, nevermind that. What's your name?
- Peters, sir.
- Just a minute, just a minute.
Where were you last night?
- I beg your pardon!
- Oh, so you did do something.
- I don't like your looks.
- What's that got to do with it? This is no beauty contest.
- Who's Stevens?
- I am.
- I'm Harrigan.
- I'm Mulligan.
I'm Garrity.
Harrigan? Mulligan? Garrity?
I sent for you because I need protection.
- My life's been threatened.
- Now, tell me. Any clues?
One very vital one.
This warning from the Gorilla.
That's weird. You got nothing to worry about.
- Mark that down, Garrity.
- Right. How do you spell Gorilla? Two R's or two L's?
Gorilla? Gorilla...
G- O-R... G! G?
G- O... Oh!
Gori...?
Did you... did you...?
Did you say Gorilla?
Why, gentlemen, you're not afraid?
- Oh, no. No.
- No, we're not afraid. We just thought maybe we...
- Thank you.
- The Gorilla coming here?
- It was nice to have met you, Mr. Stevens.
- Quiet!
Quiet!
Ah, yes.
I've already taken the precaution of arming my servant and myself.
And I think you'll find every door and window securely bolted.
I couldn't've done better myself.
With that sort of job, Mr. Stevens, you've got nothing to worry about.
- What's your plan, Mr. Harrigan?
- Well, first we'll take a look around the house.
Come on, men.
Now, you just sit tight, Mr. Stevens.
The Gorilla will get you over our dead bodies.
- Jack?
- Yes, darling?
- Who were those men?
- Probably the detectives your uncle hired.
Jack, I'm terribly worried. What are we going to do?
Well, it seems there isn't anything we can do yet.
Listen, darling. It isn't that I'm trying to appear skeptical. It's just that, well...
Somehow I can't make myself believe all this.
But that note! You saw the note.
Of course I did. But, still, I...
Look, darling. We'll wait.
We'll wait and see if something really does happen.
But what if it does?
I just don't believe it will.
Jack!
Excuse me, sir. I try to put your car away.
But unfortunately, there's something wrong with it.
What do you mean?
It won't start.
Excuse me, sir.
He gives me the creeps.
He doesn't exactly give me an appetite either.
But I wouldn't let him worry you if I were you.
Honestly, darling, don't you think there's any cause for alarm?
I'm afraid I don't.
Oh, there you are. Have a sherry before dinner?
Thank you, no.
Uncle Walter, how long have you had that butler?
Not very long. Why?
Well, are you sure he's alright?
I've found him so. Why?
Well, because I...
Dinner is served, sir.
Oh. Shall we go in?
You'd better drink a little of that, Kitty.
It'll quiet your nerves.
Why? Can you hear them?
Oh, here, take it.
What my nerves really need is a good, long trip!
Here!
Now, look here, where were you last night?
- Me? Why, I...
- Answer yes or no!
- I was...
- What were you doing there?
- Doing where?
- Well, how do we know?
Besides, I don't like your looks.
Did you ever take a good look at yourself?
- Yeah!
- Yeah, did you ever take a look...?
Here, now wait a minute, you. Where were you last night?
I spent the night with Shakespeare.
Yeah? Where is he?
He's dead.
Dead!
A murder mystery!
Have any idea who did it?
Look, Shakespeare's been dead hundreds of years!
Hundreds of...? This is a fine time to call us in on the case.
Say, but she couldn't've done it.
- How do you know?
- She can't be hundreds of years old.
That's write. Mark that down, Garrity.
Yeah, what do we do now, chief?
Well, you two have a look out there. I'll look here.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
What's this?
That's a door.
It leads to the back stairs.
Back stairs?
Well, remind me to have a look up there sometime.
That's an ironing board.
Yes.
It's an ironing board.
- Look, do you want this thing?
- Certainly we want it. Why do you think we iron on it?
Well, I...
Well, here, take it!
Garrity! Garrity! Garrity!
Come in here! We found it!
- You found what?
- The mystery.
- Well, that's hash.
- Ain't that a mystery?
- Some very good turkey, chief.
- I'll be the judge o' that.
I'm afraid, gentlemen, you won't find the Gorilla in there.
Why will we not find the Gorilla in there?
Now, listen you! I've had...!
Let that be a lesson to you.
Perhaps you gentlemen had better look outside for clues.
Maybe he killed Shakespeare.
Mark that down, Garrity.
Yeah.
Look, how do you get out of here?
That's what I'd like to know.
- Where's the back door?
- In back of you.
In back of me?
Don't you recall that the paper said the Gorilla always sends a warning to as many as half a dozen people at the same time?
To sorta throw the police off.
Maybe that's what he's doing now.
Perhaps it's just a ruse.
Well, let's hope so.
You know, it's wonderful how much more optimistic a good dinner can make one feel.
Shall we have licueurs in the study?
- Walter!
- Peters, Peters, a light, quickly!
Jack!
What is it? What happened?
Oh, uncle, are you hurt?
Why, no. No.
I don't know what happened.
- Look here.
- It seems to have been thrown in, through that window.
Oh, Uncle Walter!
What are we going to do?
The first thing you're going to do, or rather Jack is going to do...
Is to take you away from here.
But you're coming with us.
It's him! It's him!
Uncle Walter!
Who is it?
Oh! It's alright. It's one of those detectives.
He did give me a turn!
Did you see that face?
I bet when he gets drunk, snakes see him.
What's the matter with you, scaring us half to death?
I'm just trying to let you know I'm not the Gorilla!
This is my niece, Ms. Denby, and her fiancée, Mr. Marsden.
Harrigan, Mulligan and Garrity.
This seems to be a bit more serious than I thought.
I just received this from the Gorilla.
A note. Who brought it?
No one brought it. It was thrown in through that window.
Through that window? Ha, through that window!
- He's right!
- Wait a minute.
This is my good ear.
Oh, say, that's right! You can't kid us!
We were outside patrolling the grounds!
What do you mean?
Why, the note couldn't have come through that window.
- Why not?
- Well, I'll just show you. Stand back, ma'am.
- That's why.
- But it was wrapped around a stone.
It was... a stone?
Well, why didn't you say so?
Anyway, what do you know about this thing?
Well, I don't know anything about it. We were preparing to leave the room...
...and suddenly the lights went out and...
...then there was a crash and...
So the lights went out, eh?
- Make a note o' that, Garrity.
- Fine.
You were outside a few minutes ago. Didn't you see anybody?
Nobody but us. Say, this note says at midnight.
- At midnight?
- Yeah.
What time's it now?
- It's 10:30.
- I got 11:10.
I got 11:30.
It is exactly 11:45.
Remind me to put some hands on this watch.
- Yes. Well, make a note o' that, Garrity.
- Right.
Now, look. The Gorilla's after Stevens. We'll have to keep an eye on 'em. Everybody, into the study.
Come on, let's go.
Who said that if you give a criminal enough rope, he'll hang himself?
- You, chief!
- Oh, that's where I heard it before.
Come on.
Now that you're all here, I don't want anybody to move, understand?
Is it alright if I breathe?
Yes, but come right back.
- Quiet!
- Personally, I don't believe the Gorilla's coming here.
Neither do I.
Why not?
I'll give you three good reasons, pal.
Harrigan, Mulligan and Garrity.
It ain't enough.
Now, look here!
- I don't wanna have no
... Now, wait a minute. I'll handle this.
- Yeah, but you always...
- Yeah, but you...
You've received the Gorilla's warning, Walter Stevens.
You've just five minutes to live.
Oh, Uncle Walter! Jack...
- Excuse me.
- Here, here, here. Now where you going?
- I'm getting out of here.
- There's no door there!
Well, that's alright. I'll make one.
Quiet, quiet everybody!
Did you hear that?
I wish I didn't.
He's up there, men!
- Where you going?
- I say, he's up there!
That's what I thought you said.
Quiet.
Alright, men. Follow me!
Stick 'em up! I got you covered!
- What happened? What was it?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.
Hey! Did you just pass here?
Yes. Yes, of course. I brought the trunk down from the attic.
- A trunk?
- Yes.
Were we here?
I couldn't say.
Well, maybe we're not here now.
Maybe.
May...
It's two minutes of twelve. What about Uncle Walter?
Uncle Walter, yes... Uncle Walter, we've...
Just going in here... We'll...
Now, everybody!
Stay just where you are.
Mulligan, you watch those doors. Garrity, you watch that one.
Mr. Stevens, you've... got nothing to worry about.
I wish I thought so.
Me, too.
You have one more minute, Walter Stevens.
I can't stand it any longer! I can't!
You've got to call the police! You've got to!
Mr. Stevens, I'm sorry, but Norma's right.
I don't know what this is all about, but certainly if there's something to it, the police oughtta know about it.
I no longer know what to think.
Perhaps you'd better.
Hello? Hello?
The phone, there's something wrong with it!
Mulligan, Garrity, it's me!
Uncle Walter! He's gone!
Gone? How can he be gone when every door and window in this room has been locked?
Mulligan, check those windows! Garrity, check that door!
How did you get in here?
Why, through this door, sir.
How can you when the doors are locked?
- I beg your pardon, it was not locked.
- I locked it myself.
- It is locked.
- That leaves us deadlocked.
It would be impossible for me to walk through the woodwork.
Why? Termites do.
Oh, this isn't getting us anywhere!
Now, leave everything to me!
Gorilla ain't gonna make a monkey out of me.
Now, you...
Come on, boys.
- Where do these stairs lead to?
- To the bedroom.
Mulligan, Garrity, you have a look upstairs.
Marsden, you come with me and we'll have a look around the grounds.
You two to the servants' wing.
With the Gorilla prowling around? Not me!
Well, alright, then, come with me!
Oh, nevermind. I'll take my chances with the other Gorilla.
But, wait a minute. We can't leave Ms. Denby here alone.
- Well, what are you waiting for?
- I don't know, but I wish I could think of something.
- Me, too.
- Oh, go on!
- Don't worry, darling.
- Oh, that's alright. I'll do all the worrying.
Marsden, come with me.
Oh, you first, sir.
Thank you very much.
Why couldn't this've all happened tomorrow?
What difference would that make?
Tomorrow's my day off.
Poor Uncle Walter.
Right from under our very eyes!
I don't understand how he got out of here.
All that's worrying me is how I'm gonna get outta here.
Oh, it's him, it's him!
I seen 'em! I seen 'em! It's the Gorilla! I seen 'em!
- What's up?
- It's the Gorilla! I tell you! He's in the closet there!
Oh, Jack, I'm so frightened!
- Come outta there, you.
- Get 'em, Mulligan.
- You heard him, Garrity.
- What did he say?
Are you sure it wasn't a hallucination?
Not unless a hallucination has hair on it.
Come on.
- Now, ready?
- Yeah, yeah.
Is he dead?
- Who's he?
- I've never seen him before.
- Do you know him?
- No, sir. And this is no time for no introductions.
He's not dead.
- Mark that down, too.
- Right.
Come on, darling. We're getting out of here.
I'm afraid now, too. For you!
And I'm afraid now, too, for me!
Oh, Jack, it's horrible.
I don't know what to make of it.
All I can say is the Gorilla's around here somewhere!
And I know Mr. Stevens is around here somewhere!
And if you all look, we'll find 'em somewhere!
- Where you going?
- Somewhere!
Alright, men. Take 'em upstairs.
- Come on, Garrity.
- You! Lead the way.
I'll take care of 'em. Kitty, get a basin of hot water.
Do you mind if I go outta town to get it?
You and I have a look around the house.
Wait a minute. There's something funny about this.
Kitty said she saw the Gorilla's arm.
We open the closet and find the sailor's body.
Now, how did the body get in there?
And how'd the Gorilla get out without our seeing him?
That's just what I was about to ask you.
Stevens was sitting right here in this chair until the lights went out.
Gorilla? Night-night!
That's funny.
What's funny?
Nothing. I think I'll have a look around this house.
Have a look around the house?
Yes... and have a look around the house.
Yes. I'll go, too.
Hey, that guy won't talk.
- Why not?
- He's still unconscious.
You're unconscious and you talk.
- Hey, that's great, chief.
- Mark that down, Garrity.
- Right.
- What do we do now?
Well, first we'll have to reenact the crime.
So how do we do that?
Now, let's see. When the lights went out,
Stevens was sitting in that chair.
You're Stevens. Sit down.
- I'm Stevens.
- Mulligan, close the doors.
Hey! I'm Garrity!
You're Stevens! Now sit down!
I'll work the lights.
One, two, three.
Ah, it's no use.
I don't know. It works for Sherlock Holmes.
I don't know why it won't work for me!
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
- He's gone.
- He's gone?
Gone... Garrity!
Garrity!
Now we have two mysteries to solve.
- Look, I've got an idea.
- What is it?
If we can find out how Garrity disappeared, we'll find out what happened to Stevens.
That's a very good idea.
Shoulda thought o' that myself.
Alright, we'll reenact the crime. Sit down.
- But I'm not tired.
- Do you have to be tired to sit down?
I do.
You make me tired!
Well, then, why don't you sit down?
If I sit down, who's gonna work the lights?
- I never thought o' that.
- Yeah, well, sit down.
- Yeah, sit down.
- Sit down...
One... two... three!
Mulligan!
Mulligan!
Did you lose something?
Yes, Mulligan and Garrity!
Go over there.
Now, look. Sit down.
Oh, I don't wanna sit down.
You don't have to want to! You'll sit down and like it!
Oh, alright. I'll sit down but I won't like it.
What're you gonna do?
What I'm gonna do ain't important.
Well, what am I gonna do?
That's just what I wanna find out.
One...
Two...
Two and a... two.
Two...
Two...
Three!
Did I hear somebody scream?
Well, if you didn't, you ought to have your ears cleaned out!
Say, where's Mr. Harrigan?
The detective! He's disappeared!
Disappeared? What a pity.
Pity? Why, it's entirely...
How did you get in here?
We... Why, you're...
Don't be frightened. You're safe with me.
Safe with you, I?
Who wants to be safe?
Now, look. I'm very sociable.
I wanna go where there's people!
Hey, what's the matter? What's happened?
Look, I'm standing here, and all of a sudden...
Everything goes black.
Next thing I know, I'm here.
That's funny.
Hello?
Hello, I'm sorry I kept you waiting.
No, no. You turn on Willow Drive.
Off Highway 22, and hurry, will you?
Thank you.
Look, it ain't human, I tell you.
It ain't human!
What isn't human?
For a guy to be standing here one minute...
...and the next minute, he's gone!
- Who's gone?
- I'm gone, they're gone, everybody's gone!
It don't make sense.
Certainly doesn't. Will you have a cigarette?
I don't mind if I do.
He takes us right from under his very eyes.
Who does?
The Gorilla!
Hey! Who are you?
What do you want?
What are you doing here?
Listen, man. You got me all wrong. I just came in to use the telephone. You see, my car broke down and...
This phone?
Look, that phone is out of order.
- Is it?
- Yes.
Number, please?
Well, if you'll excuse me, I'll be on my way.
Now, wait a minute, you!
You're the guy we're looking for!
- You're the Gorilla!
- Surely you don't think I'm the Gorilla!
I stopped thinking two hours ago.
- But you don't understand!
- I don't have to understand!
- Shall I try?
- No, you've tried enough, not get 'em up!
Listen, you're making a big mistake.
Well, it won't be the first time.
No... alright...
Alright, I got you covered.
Help!
Shake 'em up... shake 'em up.
Help!
Help!
Oh, help.
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help me!
What's the matter? What is it?
I got 'em, I got 'em. I tell you, I got 'em!
- Got 'em, where?
- Yes, he... Well, I did have 'em.
Here, get me outta these.
Keys are in my pocket.
They're right there.
Oh, it was terrible. The Gorilla, the Gorilla!
How'd you get all tied up like this?
The Gorilla, I tell you. It wasn't my fault.
He came in and hit me.
It was... Did I leave him in there?
I'm Stevens...
Wait a minute! How'd you fellows get in there?
You tell me. What're you doing with those things on?
Oh, look. A fellow walks right in.
It was the Gorilla, I tell you!
- Yeah?
- And starts to use that phone!
But he didn't get very far, not with me on the job.
Lucky thing for him you had your handcuffs with you.
Where is he? Where'd he go?
See, I'm the victim. How should I know?
Look, boys, I'm telling you, he walked in, six of 'em. Six big gorillas, they attacked me...
Hit me right on my crown. Look at that lump.
Yeah, look at this lump.
Right there.
These windows are locked.
From the inside.
You're not kidding.
Kidding? With the Gorilla right under my nose and a ten thousand dollar reward, he says I'm kidding!
Well, are you?
Who belongs to this?
What is it?
- Coat.
- Why, gorillas don't wear coats.
Sure, they do. Fur coats.
There's something screwy about all this.
Look, if there's anything screwy about this...
...it's me.
It's me!
But I'll soon find out. Each of you grab a wall.
What do we do with it?
Mulligan, you take that one.
Marsden, you take that one.
- I'll take that one.
- I'll sit this one out.
You won't sit anyone out! Grab it!
Now, take it easy.
Alright, now tap, each one of you.
See if you can find some trap doors.
Oh, must be out there. Come on, men, right out here.
Alright, cover the door, men.
What's the matter with all of you? I've been pounding on that door for the last ten minutes!
- Who are you?
- That's right. Who are you?
Nevermind who I am. I wanna know where Walter Stevens is.
Oh, you want to know where Mr. Stevens is, eh?
He wants to know where Walter Stevens is!
Who do you think we're looking for?
I didn't come here to play games.
I wanna see Walter Stevens and I wanna see 'em right now!
You don't understand. These gentlemen are detectives.
Detectives, bah! What are you trying to pull on me?
I talked to Stevens on the telephone last night.
He told me he had a plan to pay his debt.
- Plan?
- Yes, said he'd only just started working on it.
Well, did he tell you what this plan is?
I wasn't interested.
He wants to square up with me here tonight!
When I talked to him, he wanted a couple of days more to raise the money that he owes me!
Now where is he?
Well, Mr. Stevens' been kidnapped by the Gorilla!
Kidnapped by... Poppycock!
Now, look here! I don't know who any of you are!
But I do know this. Walter Stevens owes me two hundred and fifty thousand dollars!
And I'm going to collect it! Tonight! Or else!
- Now, wait a minute.
- Don't, buddy.
How do we know you're... Say, who are you, anyway?
I'm one of Stevens' clients.
I have proof that Stevens has been stealing from his clients' accounts for over a year.
I gave him until tonight to return my money.
And I'm not going to leave this house until I get it.
Yeah, but wait a minute, wait a minute...
I think he's mad.
Jack! If what that man says is true...
- I don't believe Uncle Walter could...
- It's almost impossible to know what to believe, darling.
Yet things are adding up. If your uncle did have a plan, if this business of sending for you was part of the plan...
Take her upstairs and keep an eye on her. This has gone far enough!
- It's gone too far!
- It's even gone farther than that.
I'll be alright. It's just too much excitement for one night.
Get your hat and coat, darling. I'm gonna see that you get to town if I have to push the car all the way myself.
I can't go til we find Uncle Walter.
We'll take care o' that. We'll break this case, won't we, boys?
- Won't we?
- Oh, sure we will! Sure!
Like it was walnuts.
- You know, I feel sorry for that poor girl.
- Yeah? What about poor us?
Strange men zooming in an out. Animals running around like this was a zoo!
Crazy goes on! I wanna go home.
Oh, so you wanna go home? I'm ashamed of you.
I'm ashamed of you!
You wanna take a run off and leave that girl here to take the blame alone?
- We're detectives, aren't we?
- Are we?
Haven't we looked all over this house?
- Yes.
- No.
- Where haven't we looked?
- Well, if there's a cellar, we haven't looked there.
- I'm glad I thought o' that.
- Say, this looks like a cellar.
Where?
- It's locked.
- Well, try your key.
Oh, yes, never thought o' that.
Alright, come on, men.
- Anybody down there?
- Uh, yes. We are.
- Now, look for a switch.
- It's around here somewhere.
Alright, come on outta there, you.
Come on. Get outta there.
Alright, come on...
Alright, come on outta there!
Mulligan?
- Where are you?
- I'm right here, chief.
Garrity, where are you?
Over here, chief.
Is anybody with me?
No, you're alone.
Mulligan, Harrigan! Something bit me!
What? First time I saw a mousetrap catch a piece o' cheese.
Harrigan! Garrity! Please get me outta this!
Get me outta this thing!
- Maybe you'd like a ride.
- Oh, come on, Garrity...
Garrity! Harrigan!
Garrity! Harrigan!
Now, don't worry. I'll handle this.
- It's a pleasure.
- Yeah, don't worry about it.
Okay, buddy. Come on, bud. Get that raccoon coat off.
Come on! Get that thing off!
Want me to hit you over the head with this thing?
Well...
We've been double-crossed!
Let's get outta here!
- Peters?
- Yes, sir?
What's all that commotion?
Sounds like our friends, the detectives.
You stay here with Ms. Denby.
I'll go see what's up.
Cognac, Ms. Denby?
No. No, thank you.
What's the matter? What's all the racket?
I got him, I tell you! I got him!
You got him? Got who?
- Yes, the Gorilla! He's in there!
- He's in there!
- I can hear him breathe!
- That's you.
Well, open it, open it!
Have you men been drinking?
No, but it's a good idea.
What was that?
- Norma, what's happening?
- It's the Gorilla!
Norma, where are you?
Jack!
A couple o' you get after 'em, quick!
- You heard 'em, Mulligan.
- So did you.
Nevermind, then. You take the hall. I'll go this way.
I'll stay here.
- Is something wrong?
- Where were you?
- I just went to get some tea, sir.
- Didn't I tell you to stay here with Ms. Denby?
I'm very sorry, sir. But I thought that perhaps a little tea...
What right have you got to think? We're not even thinking!
Ms. Denby might've been killed.
It's fortunate she wasn't, sir.
Why is it that something always happens when you're not here?
An unfortunate coincidence, sir.
- What did you find?
- An empty closet with Harrigan in it.
- Harrigan, Harrigan, Harrigan! Wake up.
- Get up.
- Wake up.
- The Gorilla, the Gorilla!
Did you get him? Did you get him?
- No, he got you.
- Well, it won't happen again.
- Okay, men. Follow me.
- Okay.
Follow me.
Go down and see where these stairs lead to.
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.
- Oh, me!
- It's awful dark. I shoulda brung my glasses.
- You never wore any glasses.
- That's right. I forgot.
- What's that funny tapping?
- Yeah!
It's my knees.
It's a fine time to be scared!
- You try and think of a better time.
- Yeah, well...
Look, look.
I've had about enough o' this!
Me and the Gorilla's gonna have a showdown right now!
- That's right, chief.
- I'm telling you I can't stand it!
Now, don't argue with me!
I know what I'm talking about!
I'm going in there, and we'll look over this house.
And he'll take orders from me, understand?
I'm gonna tear this house apart!
Tear it limb from limb!
Now, come on, follow me!
I'll show this monk who's a monk!
You fellows stay close behind me.
If anything happens, leave it to me.
I'll do all the talking.
Come on, men.
People here running here to there all day.
All day long. I've never seen anything like this in all my life.
First... Hey, where are you going?
What's eating you?
What've you got there?
That dame musta saw something or she wouldn't be running away like that.
Make a note o' that, Garrity.
Garrity! Mulligan!
- Good evening.
- Good evening...
- What do you want?
- Don't be frightened.
Frightened? Who's frightened?
Don't you come near me! I'll wrap this thing around your neck like it was a pretzel!
- There's nothing to worry about.
- That's what you think.
- May I give you some advice?
- No!
If I were you, I'd go to my room and stay there.
Why, yes, sir. I was just planning on that!
Wait a minute. Where have you been?
No place. Honest, sir! I was just getting ready to go to town!
- Good.
- Don't open that!
- Why not?
- The Gorilla! He's in there!
Don't be silly.
- Get going now. Get going.
- Yes, sir. I'm practically there!
That ain't a man. It's a gorilla. We saw it and we felt it!
I tell you, the Gorilla is a man. I ought to know.
I've read enough about him.
But how could a monkey possibly have written those notes to Uncle Walter?
Maybe it's got an education.
Poe! Poe!
Poe! Where is he, have any o' you seen him?
- Who?
- Poe.
- Who's Poe?
- Poe's the gorilla.
- The Gorilla?
- Oh, you know 'em, too, eh?
Know 'em? I trained 'em since he was that high.
You're just the one we're looking for.
Don't any of you understand? Poe is a gorilla, a trained gorilla.
- A real gorilla?
- Sure, a real gorilla.
Well, so we don't know what we're talking about, eh?
Yeah, we know a monkey when we see one.
Listen, this is serious. Poe ain't no pet.
There's no telling what he's liable to do when I ain't around.
'Specially with women. He hates women.
Well, what's he doing here? What're you doing here?
We was hired to come here. We're working at the County Fair.
Yesterday, a guy comes along, says he wants me to bring Poe here.
He says he's giving a party, wants us to put on our act.
- Who hired you?
- I don't know. I don't know nothing.
All I know is I bring Poe here, we're waiting out in the garage like he tells me.
Waiting to do our stuff.
All of a sudden, somebody gives me a clunk over the head and I wake up in a lady's boudoir.
But the gorilla... how'd he get loose?
You're asking me! That's what I wanna find out.
Listen, this is serious. We gotta find 'em.
We gotta. Somebody's liable to get killed.
The note from the Gorilla!
Fall against your fifty they were addressed to me!
Notes? Poe can't write no notes!
Even I don't know how to write.
Now, look. The next time I buck up against that gorilla...
I'm telling you, I'll...
Well, I'll...
He'll never know!
He'll do it!
- Listen, have you seen 'em?
- Yes, he's in the kitchen.
- Which way is the kitchen?
- Through the panel.
We'll go with you.
Listen, you fellows better wait here. There's no telling what that ape'll do.
Oh, Jack, I'm so confused.
A real gorilla, and those notes, and...
Listen to me, everybody.
The Gorilla has done his work.
Walter Stevens is dead.
You will find his body in the garage.
Oh, Jack!
Alright, everybody. Follow me to the garage!
Come on.
- Come on.
- Come on.
He's gone! Poe's gone!
- I tell you, he's in the kitchen!
- The kitchen's a wreck. He must be on a rampage!
Outta my way, brother. I got my own troubles to worry about.
Alright, all of you! Out in the garage! Come on!
I'll stay here and protect Ms. Denby.
This way, please.
I'll never forgive myself for not calling the police.
Why call the police with us around, lady?
You couldn't save Uncle Walter.
We couldn't, eh?
- Well, you didn't, did you?
- Well, we...
That's right, we didn't.
I gotta find out how that gorilla gets in and outta here.
There must be a secret spring around here someplace.
I think I'll look in back o' these books.
Help!
Help!
Somebody! Get me outta here somebody!
Don't tell me she's the Gorilla!
I told you I didn't like her looks.
- Oh, wise guy!
- Come on, we gotta find the body.
- What'd I do with them keys?
- Look under the mat.
- That's funny!
- Oh, very funny. Will you get me out of here?
Listen, what're you doing in Poe's cage?
What do you think I'm doing, waiting for somebody to feed me peanuts?
Get me outta here!
Don't you know Poe hates women?
So does Kipling. So what? Will you please get me out of here?
Alright, don't get excited.
Say, wait a minute. I think this was a trick to get us outta the house.
Come on.
- Who are you anyway?
- I'm the gorilla's keeper!
- Are you the one that gave me the clunk on the head?
- No, but it was a good idea.
Oh, yeah?
Look!
- He's got her!
- Don't talk! He'll drop her!
Poe! Bring her down, Poe!
Bring her down to me!
Down, Poe! Down to the ground!
Put her down, Poe!
Down, Poe! Down to the ground!
Poe! Stop it, Poe!
Bring her down, Poe!
Bring her down to me!
Put her down, Poe.
Come on.
Poe, Poe, come back here! Help me catch him!
Oh, thank you, thank you.
He hit me again!
Right here, he hit...
Poe! Let him alone!
That's a fine way to treat me.
After I give you the best years of my life.
You act like that... Listen here.
No, no. No kisses.
He might have killed somebody!
What do you mean, might have?
That's alright, lady. I got him.
You can keep him!
Okay. Scram, but take this character with you.
I was only kidding.
Just for that, he gets no c-a-n-d-y.
Oh, well, that's just c-a-n-d-y.
Sorry if I caused you any trouble, folks.
Yeah, and just for that, I won't read you the funny papers tonight.
Put you in bed without any supper, you bad boy.
You wait'll I get you home!
You have heard the last of this!
Come on!
Look at that.
Why, it's somebody's coat!
Alright, come on outta there, buddy.
So that's how I got clunked on the head.
Come on, come on outta there, you!
Look! It's opening!
Come on, come on...
Oh, so it's you!
- Do you know him?
- Do I know him? He's the guy I caught using the telephone!
- There's no law against that.
- Nevermind law, buddy. Get 'em up.
Now, just a minute. Don't you think you're a little premature?
Prema... Well, I can't remember that far back.
Just who are you?
I'm Detective Kletty.
An investigator for the Securities and Exchange Commission.
And I'm on the trail of the Gorilla, just as you are.
- A detective?
- How do we know that?
Yes, we...
Yeah, well, what were you doing in there?
Investigating. I've been on this case for some weeks now.
And I've discovered a little about the construction of this house...
...that my good friend here don't seem to have found out yet.
What do you mean?
This house is a maze of secret panels.
Now, undoubtedly, the voice of the Gorilla came through that radio from someplace right in this house.
That means that if we find the wire leading away from the radio...
We'd at least find the Gorilla's hideout!
And what's going on here!
Well, here it is. Here's the wire going right in here.
It's found.
Now, let's see...
Just as I thought!
Here's the wire!
Now, by tracing this, I think we may find the answer to this entire riddle.
The wire goes in here.
Back of this wall is the man we want.
Now, make a note o' that, Garr...
- Are you all armed?
- Yes, I'm armed.
Quiet, you!
Here it is.
There's your microphone, and as I expected, there's your Gorilla.
Mr. Stevens, the Gorilla?
Why, sure, I could have told you that all the time!
I guess the party's over, my Gorilla friend.
Yeah, but who tied 'em up like that?
I don't know. He figured the game was up and that this would throw off suspicion.
This is a homemade job. A child could've done it.
Ah, proposterous! Don't believe him!
I never saw this man before in my life! He's insane!
Now, what's that?
Why is it, with all the men in the house, they have to leave us here with you?
Quiet!
Why, it's Mr. Stevens!
- Alias, the Gorilla.
- The Gorilla?
Him?
Oh, I'll never trust another man if I live to be a thousand!
You can make that two thousand.
Uncle Walter, the Gorilla?
I don't believe it!
I think I can make it very clear.
- Oh, sure we can!
- Now, first of all...
- What's that?
- I didn't hear a thing!
Neither did I, but what was it?
We'll soon find out.
Hey, what is this?
Who hit me?
What's going on around here?
- It's that man again.
- Oh, there you are!
Kidnapped! Kidnapped by the Gorilla!
- Not kidnapped by the Gorilla, Mister...
- Conway. A.P. Conway.
Ah, the A.P. stands for ape!
Mr. Conway, this gentleman is the Gorilla!
- The Gorilla?
- But if Uncle Walter's the Gorilla...
...I don't understand why he should send himself those notes of warning.
For two reasons!
To keep you here and to throw off suspicion from himself.
Ms. Denby, under the terms of your father's will, if anything were to happen to you...
...who would inherit your estate?
Uncle Walter.
My hunch was right.
Your uncle brought you here tonight to kill you for your money.
Well, at least he had a reason!
So that's why he wouldn't let us call the police.
That's exactly why.
But what about these men, these private detectives?
They almost speak for themselves.
Do you think if Stevens life had actually been threatened...
...he would've called in three morons such as these for protection?
- Protection...
- Morons!
Hey! Wait a minute, I resent that!
But I tell you, I saw the Gorilla! Right there in that closet!
I saw his hand, then his arm...
And it was no optical confusion!
What you saw was this sleeve!
Another ingenious little invention of Mr. Stevens.
A very cute little idea!
Well, that about clears the whole matter up.
And since it's stopped raining, I think I better go.
- You're okay, buddy!
- You're okay!
Congratulations! Let me congratulate you! You were wonderful!
Oh, no you don't, buddy! Okay, folks.
Say howdy to the Gorilla!
- Howdy.
- Alright, give out or this moron is gonna blow your brains out.
Well, you see...
Now, all of you stick your hands up.
I'm the Gorilla, alright.
But the cops haven't been able to get me, so don't you halfwits get any crazy notions.
And as for Mr. Stevens, he's just as crooked as I told you he was.
The trouble with him is he talks too much and too loud.
I got tipped off on what was gonna happen here tonight.
How he was gonna pretend to be me!
How he was gonna get the two hundred and fifty thousand dollars and at the same time...
...let him get the blame for all the Gorilla murders.
We were careful.
I'm a little nervous tonight.
Drop that gun. And I advise you not to move.
Hello? Police station, quickly.
What is this? I thought the phone was out of order!
- Maybe he paid his bill.
- Hello?
This is Walter Stevens speaking.
Send a squad car to my house.
We've got the Gorilla.
Things are so mixed-up around here that even the Gorilla doesn't know who the Gorilla is!
He's the Gorilla, he's the Gorilla.
Do I know what I'm doing?
Look, what's going on here?
Don't look so sad, darling. Your uncle isn't a crook!
The estate's all safe and sound now.
You know, you never can tell. This is liable to wind up to be a mystery!
You see, the Gorilla murders were threatening to bankrupt our insurance company.
Most of the victims were clients of ours.
So Conway, our special investigator, cooked up his little scheme to trap the killer.
I'm sorry I had to frighten you, dear.
- And you, too, Kitty.
- Oh, I wasn't frightened. I was numb.
You fellows are certainly great detectives.
- Oh, yes.
- We could have told you that!
Did you know that Kletty was the Gorilla all along?
- Sure we did!
- No, we didn't.
When did you find out he was the Gorilla?
When I shook hands with him.
- I don't get you.
- Well, you see, I was a window trimmer.
In a department store.
And I oughtta know a phony feel when I feel one.
We'll never be able to thank you, Mr. Harrigan.
Oh, well, that's alright. I understand you two are getting married soon.
Well, if you call tomorrow soon...
Well, remember, if you have any trouble with her, our specialty is following wives!
You know where to send the check.
And be sure it's certified.
From a detective's bank.
- Bye.
- Bye.
"Among the rugged peaks that frown down upon the Borgo Pass
"are found crumbling castles of a bygone age."
I say, driver, a bit slower.
No, no!
We must reach the inn before sundown.
And why, pray?
It is Walpurgis Night, the night of evil.
Nosferatu.
On this night, madam, the doors, they are barred and to the Virgin we pray.
I say, porter.
Don't take my luggage down.
I'm going on to Borgo Pass tonight.
No, no, please.
Put that back up there.
The driver, he is afraid.
Walpurgis Night.
Good fellow, he is.
He wants me to ask if you can wait and go on after sunrise.
Well, I'm sorry, but there's a carriage meeting me at Borgo Pass at midnight.
- Borgo Pass?
- Yes.
Whose carriage?
Count Dracula's.
Count Dracula's?
Yes.
Castle Dracula?
Yes, that's where I'm going.
To the castle?
Yes.
No. You mustn't go there.
We people of the mountains believe at the castle there are vampires!
Dracula and his wives.
They take the form of wolves and bats.
They leave their coffins at night and they feed on the blood of the living.
Oh, but that's all superstition.
Why, I can't understand why...
Look, the sun.
When it is gone, they leave their coffins.
Come. We must go indoors.
But wait! I mean, just a minute, I...
What I'm trying to say is that I'm not afraid.
I've explained to the driver that it's a matter of business with me.
I've got to go. Really.
Well, good night.
Wait. Please.
If you must go, wear this, for your mother's sake.
It will protect you.
The coach from Count Dracula?
Hey, driver!
I say, driver, what do you mean by going at this...
I am Dracula.
It's really good to see you.
I don't know what happened to the driver and my luggage and...
Well, and with all this,
I thought I was in the wrong place.
I bid you welcome.
Listen to them.
Children of the night.
What music they make.
The spider spinning his web for the unwary fly.
The blood is the life, Mr. Renfield.
Why...
Yes.
I'm sure you will find this part of my castle more inviting.
Well, rather.
It's quite different from outside.
Oh, and the fire, it's so cheerful.
I didn't know, but that you might be hungry.
Thank you.
That's very kind of you, but I'm a bit worried about my luggage.
You see, all your papers were in...
I took the liberty of having your luggage brought up.
Allow me.
Oh, yes.
Thanks.
I trust you have kept your coming here a secret.
I've followed your instructions implicitly.
Excellent, Mr. Renfield.
Excellent.
And now, if you're not too fatigued,
I would like to discuss the lease on Carfax Abbey.
Oh, yes. Everything is in order awaiting your signature.
Well, here.
Here's the lease.
Why, I hope I've brought enough labels for your luggage.
I'm taking with me only three boxes.
Very well.
I have chartered a ship to take us to England.
We will be leaving tomorrow evening.
Everything will be ready.
I hope you will find this comfortable.
Thanks. It looks very inviting.
Oh, it's nothing serious.
Just a small cut from that paper clip.
It's just a scratch.
This is very old wine.
I hope you will like it.
Aren't you drinking?
I never drink wine.
Well...
It's delicious.
And now I'll leave you.
Well, good night.
Good night, Mr. Renfield.
Master, the sun is gone!
You will keep your promise when we get to London, won't you, Master?
You will see that I get lives?
Not human lives, but small ones with blood in them.
I'll be loyal to you, Master.
I'll be loyal!
Must be a Scandinavian ship.
That's what it looks to me like.
Here now, here now, get back.
Nobody goes aboard this here boat but the authorities.
The captain dead, tied to the wheel.
Horrible tragedy, horrible tragedy.
Master, we're here!
You can't hear what I'm saying, but we're here!
We're safe!
They must have come through a terrible storm.
What's that?
Why, it's come from that hatchway!
Why, he's mad!
Look at his eyes.
Why, the man's gone crazy.
Violets! Violets!
Flower for your buttonhole, sir.
Flower for your buttonhole, sir.
Flower for your buttonhole, sir.
Flower for your buttonhole.
Here's a nice one.
And after you deliver the message, you will remember nothing I now say.
Obey.
- Dr. Seward?
- Yes?
You're wanted on the telephone.
Thank you. Well, excuse me, dear.
Oh, Father, if it's from home, will you say I'm spending the night in town with Lucy?
All right, dear.
- Pardon me.
- Yes?
I could not help overhearing your name.
Might I inquire if you are the Dr. Seward whose sanitarium is at Whitby?
Why, yes.
I'm Count Dracula.
I have just leased Carfax Abbey.
I understand it adjoins your grounds.
Why, yes, it does.
I'm very happy to make your acquaintance.
May I present my daughter Mina?
Count Dracula.
Miss Weston.
How do you do?
And Mr. Harker.
How do you do?
Count Dracula's just taken Carfax Abbey.
Oh, it'll be a relief to see light in those dismal old windows.
It will, indeed. You'll excuse me,
I'm wanted on the telephone.
The Abbey could be very attractive, but I should imagine it would need quite extensive repairs.
I shall do very little repairing.
It reminds me of the broken battlements of my own castle in Transylvania.
The Abbey always reminds me of that old toast about lofty timbers.
"The walls around are bare,
"echoing to our laughter
"as though the dead were there."
Nice little sentiment.
But there's more, even nicer.
"Pass a cup to the dead already,
"a round for the next to die..."
Oh, never mind the rest, dear.
To die, to be really dead, that must be glorious.
Why, Count Dracula!
There are far worse things awaiting man than death.
It reminds me of the broken battlements of my own castle in Transylvania.
Oh, Lucy. You're so romantic.
Laugh all you like.
I think he's fascinating.
I suppose he's all right.
But give me someone a little more normal.
Like John?
Yes, dear, like John.
Castle.
Dracula!
Transylvania.
Well, Countess,
I'll leave you to your Count and his ruined abbey.
- Good night, Lucy.
- Good night, dear.
The fog seems to be closing down a bit, sir.
Another death.
Dead.
Dr. Seward, when did Miss Weston have the last transfusion?
About four hours ago.
An unnatural loss of blood, which we've been powerless to check.
On the throat of each victim, the same two marks.
He probably wants his flies again!
No, Martin, please!
Please don't, Martin!
Oh, Martin, please!
Please, Martin! No, Martin!
Oh, Martin, please!
Here, give it to me now!
No, no, no, Martin! Please!
No, Martin! Martin, don't!
Don't throw my spider away from me.
Oh, Martin.
No.
Ain't you ashamed now? Ain't you?
Spiders now, is it?
Flies ain't good enough?
Flies? Flies?
Poor, puny things.
Who wants to eat flies?
You do, you loony.
Not when I can get nice, fat spiders!
All right. Have it your own way.
Read, dummkopf, where I have marked.
Gentlemen, we are dealing with the undead.
Nosferatu?
Yes, Nosferatu, the undead, the vampire.
The vampire attacks the throat.
It leaves two little wounds, white with red centers.
Dr. Seward, your patient, Renfield, whose blood I have just analyzed, is obsessed with the idea that he must devour living things in order to sustain his own life.
But Professor Van Helsing, modern medical science does not admit of such a creature.
The vampire is a pure myth, superstition.
I may be able to bring you proof that the superstition of yesterday can become the scientific reality of today.
But, Professor, Renfield's cravings have always been for small living things.
Nothing human.
As far as we know, Doctor.
But you tell me that he escapes from his room.
He is gone for hours.
Where does he go?
Well, Mr. Renfield, you are looking much better than you did this morning when I arrived.
Thanks, I'm feeling much better.
I am here to help you.
You understand that, do you not?
Why, of course.
And I'm very grateful.
Keep your filthy hands to yourself!
Now, now, Renfield.
Oh, Dr. Seward, send me away from this place.
Send me far away.
Why are you so anxious to get away?
My cries at night, they might disturb Miss Mina.
Yes?
They might give her bad dreams,
Professor Van Helsing.
Bad dreams.
That sounded like a wolf.
Yes, it did.
But I hardly think there are wolves so near London.
He thinks they're wolves.
Me, I've heard them howl at night before.
He thinks they're talking to him.
He howls and howls back at them.
He's crazy!
I might have known.
I might have known.
We know why the wolves talk, do we not, Mr. Renfield?
And we know how we can make them stop.
You know too much to live, Van Helsing.
Now, now, Renfield.
We'll get no more out of him now for a while.
Take him away, Martin.
On your way, old fly eater.
I'm warning you, Dr. Seward.
If you don't send me away, you must answer for what will happen to Miss Mina!
All right, Martin.
Come along, now, come along.
What was that herb that excited him so?
Wolfsbane.
It is a plant that grows in central Europe.
The natives there use it to protect themselves against vampires.
Renfield reacted very violently to its scent.
Seward, I want you to have
Renfield closely watched by day and night, especially by night.
Yes, Master.
Master, you've come back.
No, Master, please!
Please don't ask me to do that!
Don't! Not her!
Please! Please don't, Master!
Don't, please!
Please!
Oh, don't!
I lay in bed for quite a while, reading.
And just as I was commencing to get drowsy,
I heard dogs howling.
And when the dream came, it seemed the whole room was filled with mist.
It was so thick,
I could just see the lamp by the bed, a tiny spark in the fog.
And then I saw two red eyes staring at me, and a white livid face came down out of the mist.
It came closer and closer.
I felt its breath on my face, and then its lips.
Dear, it was only a dream.
And then, in the morning,
I felt so weak.
It seemed as if all the life had been drained out of me.
Darling, we're going to forget all about these dreams, think about something cheerful, aren't we?
Allow me.
Oh, certainly, Professor.
Think for a moment.
Is there anything that might have brought this dream on?
No.
Doctor, there's something troubling Mina, something she won't tell us.
And the face in the dream, you say it seemed to come closer and closer?
The lips touched you? Where?
Is there anything the matter with your throat?
- Oh, no, but I...
- Permit me.
- No, please!
- Yes, yes.
How long have you had those little marks?
Marks?
Please.
Mina, why didn't you let us know?
Do not excite her.
When, Miss Mina?
Since the morning after the dream.
What could have caused them, Professor?
Count Dracula!
It's good to see you back again, Doctor.
I heard you have just arrived.
And you, Miss Mina.
You're looking exceptionally...
Pardon me, Dr. Seward, but I think Miss Mina should go to her room at once.
Professor Van Helsing,
I don't believe it's as important as you seem to think it is.
Excuse me. Count Dracula,
Professor Van Helsing.
Van Helsing.
A most distinguished scientist whose name we know, even in the wilds of Transylvania.
I had a frightful dream a few nights ago, and I don't seem to be able to get it out of my mind.
I hope you haven't taken my stories too seriously.
Stories?
Yes.
In my humble effort to amuse your fiancée, Mr. Harker,
I was telling her some rather grim tales of my far-off country.
I can imagine.
Why, John!
I can quite understand
Mr. Harker's concern.
I'm afraid it's quite serious.
My dear, I'm sure Count Dracula will excuse you.
You must go to your room as Professor Van Helsing suggests.
Oh, but, really, Father,
I'm feeling quite well.
You had better do as your father advises.
Very well.
Good night.
John.
Miss Mina?
May I call later and inquire how you're feeling?
Why, yes. Thank you.
I'm sorry, Doctor.
My visit was so ill-timed.
Not at all.
On the contrary, it may prove to be most enlightening.
In fact, before you go, you can be of definite service.
Anything I can do. Gladly.
A moment ago,
I stumbled upon a most amazing phenomenon, something so incredible,
I mistrust my own judgment.
Look.
Dr. Seward, my humble apology.
I dislike mirrors.
Van Helsing will explain.
For one who has not lived even a single lifetime, you are a wise man, Van Helsing.
What on earth caused that?
Did you see the look on his face?
Like a wild animal!
Wild animal? Like a madman!
What's that running across the lawn?
Looks like a huge dog!
Or a wolf?
A Wolf?
He was afraid we might follow.
Follow?
Sometimes they take the form of wolves, but generally of bats.
What are you talking about?
Dracula.
But what's Dracula got to do with wolves and bats?
Dracula is our vampire.
But surely, Professor...
A vampire casts no reflection in the glass.
That is why Dracula smashed the mirror.
I don't mean to be rude, but that's the sort of thing I'd expect one of the patients here to say.
Yes, and that is what your English doctors would say, your police.
The strength of the vampire is that people will not believe in him.
Professor, vampires only exist in ghost stories.
A vampire, Mr. Harker, is a being that lives after its death by drinking the blood of the living.
It must have blood or it dies.
Its power lasts only from sunset to sunrise.
During the hours of the day, it must rest in the earth in which it was buried.
But then, if Dracula were a vampire, he'd have to return every night to Transylvania, and that's impossible.
Then he must have brought his native soil with him, boxes of it.
Boxes of earth large enough for him to rest in.
Renfield? What are you doing there?
Come here.
Did you hear what we were saying?
Yes, I heard something.
Enough.
Be guided by what he says.
It's your only hope.
It's her only hope.
I begged you to send me away, but you wouldn't.
Now it's too late.
It's happened again.
What's happened?
Take her away from here.
Take her away before...
No, no, Master!
I wasn't going to say anything!
I told them nothing!
I'm loyal to you, Master.
What have you to do with Dracula?
Dracula?
I never even heard the name before.
You will die in torment if you die with innocent blood on your soul.
Oh, no.
God will not damn a lunatic's soul.
He knows that the powers of evil are too great for those of us with weak minds.
Oh, Mr. Harker!
Mr. Harker, it's horrible!
Oh, it's horrible! Dr. Seward!
Miss Mina, out there dead!
Where? Where?
Out there!
Thank heaven she's alive.
Thank heaven for that.
Alive, yes, but in greater danger, for she's already under his influence.
It's horrible, Van Helsing, horrible!
Incredible.
Incredible, perhaps, but a fact.
We must face it.
We must cope with it.
"Further attacks on small children committed after dark
"by the mysterious woman in white took place last night.
"Narratives of two small girls, each child describing
"a beautiful lady in white who promised her chocolates,
"enticed her to a secluded spot
"and there bit her slightly in the throat."
Ghosts.
Vampires.
And then, Miss Mina?
Well, how could she know anything about the woman in white?
It's bad enough for her to read it in the newspaper...
Please, please, Mr. Harker.
And when was the next time you saw Miss Lucy after she was buried?
I was downstairs on the terrace.
She came out of the shadows and stood looking at me.
I started to speak to her.
And then I remembered she was dead.
The most horrible expression came over her face.
She looked like a hungry animal.
A Wolf.
And then she turned and ran back into the dark.
Then you know the woman in white is...
Lucy.
Miss Mina,
I promise you that after tonight she will remain at rest, her soul released from this horror.
If you can save
Lucy's soul after death, promise me you'll save mine.
Darling, you're not going to die, you're going to live.
No, John. You mustn't touch me.
And you mustn't kiss me ever again.
What are you trying to say?
You tell him.
You make him understand.
I can't.
Professor?
It's all over, John.
Our love, our life together.
Oh, no.
No, no, don't look at me like that.
I love you, John.
You.
But this horror, he wills it.
Miss Mina, you must come indoors.
You must.
You know what you're doing to her, Professor?
You're driving her crazy!
Mr. Harker, that is what you should be worrying about.
The last rays of the day's sun will soon be gone, and another night will be upon us.
Dr. Seward, I'm taking Mina with me to London tonight or I'll call in the police.
But, John...
Mina, please get your bags packed.
Seward, I must be master here or I can do nothing.
Right.
Miss Mina, both this room and your bedroom have been prepared with wolfsbane.
You will be safe if Dracula returns.
She'll be safe, all right, because she's going with me.
Mina, I'll be waiting for you in the library.
Oh, John! Father, talk to him.
Please don't let him go.
Oh, Briggs.
Miss Mina is to wear this wreath of wolfsbane when she goes to bed.
Watch her closely, and see that she does not remove it in her sleep.
I understand, Professor.
And under no circumstances must these windows be opened tonight.
Very well, sir.
You will recollect that Dracula cast no reflection in the mirror.
Yes.
And that three boxes of earth were delivered to him at Carfax Abbey.
Quite.
And knowing that a vampire must rest by day in his native soil,
I am convinced that this Dracula is no legend but an undead creature whose life has been unnaturally prolonged.
Well, Dr. Seward, what about it?
Is Mina going with me or not?
If you take her from under our protection, you will kill her.
Now, John, please, please, be patient.
Mr. Harker, please, come here.
Well.
John, I know you love her, but don't forget she's my daughter, and I must do what I think is best.
Mr. Harker,
I have devoted my lifetime to the study of many strange things, little-known facts, which the world is perhaps better off not knowing.
I know, but, Professor, all I want is to get Mina away from all of this.
That will do no good.
Our only chance of saving
Miss Mina's life is to find the hiding place of Dracula's living corpse and to drive a stake through its heart.
Isn't this a strange conversation for men who aren't crazy?
Renfield, you're compelling me to put you in a straitjacket.
You forget, Doctor, that madmen have great strength.
Dracula has great strength, eh, Renfield?
Words, words, words.
Oh, Martin. Didn't I warn you to keep a strict watch?
What? What? Again?
Yes, sir. At once, sir.
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
Here. The doctor's pet loony is loose again.
He came and stood below my window in the moonlight.
And he promised me things.
Not in words, but by doing them.
Doing them?
By making them happen.
A red mist spread over the lawn, coming on like a flame of fire.
And then he parted it.
And I could see that there were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red, like his, only smaller.
And then he held up his hand, and they all stopped.
And I thought he seemed to be saying,
"Rats. Rats.
"Rats!"
Thousands, millions of them.
"All red blood,
"all these will I give you
"if you will obey me."
What did he want you to do?
That which has already been done.
Strike me down dead, Doctor.
He's got me going.
Now he's twisted and broken them iron bars as if they was cheese.
Dracula is in the house.
In the house?
Doctor, this time he can do no harm.
We are ready for him.
Martin, come with me.
I'll show you where we can put Mr. Renfield where he won't escape again.
All right, but I have me doubts.
Come along, old fly eater.
Now, you mustn't get out of it this time.
I'm awfully sorry to have to look you up, but you've got to stay in your room.
Van Helsing.
Now that you have learned what you have learned, it would be well for you to return to your own country.
I prefer to remain and protect those whom you would destroy.
You are too late.
My blood now flows through her veins.
She will live through the centuries to come, as I have lived.
Should you escape us, Dracula, we know how to save Miss Mina's soul, if not her life.
If she dies by day.
But I shall see that she dies by night.
And I will have Carfax Abbey torn down stone by stone, excavated a mile around.
I will find your earth box and drive that stake through your heart.
Come here.
Come here.
Your will is strong,
Van Helsing.
More wolfsbane?
More effective than wolfsbane, Count.
Indeed.
Open the windows, Briggs, and let in some air.
The odor in the room from that horrible weed is stifling.
I can't stand it.
But the Professor gave orders.
Oh, never mind the Professor now.
Now, please, go back to bed at once.
I'm going to call your father.
What is it, Briggs?
Oh, I don't know, Mr. Harker.
I felt strangely dizzy.
And when it cleared away,
Miss Mina was up and dressed and out on the terrace.
And I can't get her to go to bed.
Well, let me see her.
Tell her I'm here.
John.
Oh, John, I'm so glad you're here.
Well, what have they been doing to me, dear?
Locking me in my room.
And the horrible smell of that awful weed.
It's been like a nightmare.
What's been the matter?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Mina.
You're so...
Like a changed girl.
Oh, you look wonderful.
I feel wonderful.
I've never felt better in my life.
Oh, I'm so glad to see you like this.
I've been awfully worried about you.
Mr. Harker.
You better bring Miss Mina inside.
That's all right, Briggs, now that I'm here.
Run along, Briggs. Don't worry.
John. Look, the fog's lifting.
See how plain you can see the stars?
Yes.
Millions of them.
I've never seen them so close.
Why, it looks as if you could reach out and touch them.
Would you like me to get you a hat...
Why, what's the matter?
Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.
Come.
Let's sit down.
Van Helsing.
Seward, that which I feared from the beginning has happened.
What?
Dracula boasts that he has fused his blood with that of Miss Mina.
In life, she will now become the foul thing of the night that he is.
- But Van Helsing...
- No, no, come, Seward.
Come, there's not a moment to be lost.
Oh, but I love the fog.
I love nights with fog.
But only yesterday you said you were afraid of the night.
But, darling, I could never have said anything so silly.
I couldn't. I love the night.
That's the only time
I feel really alive.
There's that bat again.
Yes?
Look out. He'll get in your hair.
Yes?
My, that was a big bat.
I will.
You will what?
Oh, I didn't say anything.
Yes, you did. You said, "I will."
Oh, no, I didn't.
John, come. Sit down.
There must be some way, some way to save her.
- There is only one...
- John.
That funny little old professor, he has a crucifix.
Now, I want you to get it away from him and hide it.
But why, dear?
Oh, he'll be wanting to protect me again from the night or Count Dracula or whatever it is.
Well, I don't know.
He may be right, Mina.
Your eyes.
They look at me so strangely.
Mina.
Mina, you're...
No, Mina, no!
Give me that. What's the idea?
Have you gone crazy?
What are you trying to do?
Frighten her to death?
No, I was trying to save her.
Save her? That's a fine way.
It's all right, darling.
Oh, John, darling, you must go away from me...
The cross, put it away.
After what's happened,
I can't bear to look at it.
What's happened?
I can't tell you. I can't.
Ah, but you must. You must tell me.
I have a right to know.
Oh, John.
You can believe everything he says.
It's all the truth.
Dracula, he...
Dracula?
Well, what's he done to you, dearie?
Tell me.
He came to me.
He opened a vein in his arm and he made me drink...
What is it?
Who is it, Martin?
It's that big gray bat again, sir.
It's no use of wasting your bullets, Martin.
They cannot harm that bat.
No, sir.
He's crazy.
They're all crazy.
They're all crazy, except you and me.
Sometimes I have me doubts about you.
Yes.
That's Renfield.
What's he doing at the Abbey?
Come, Mr. Harker.
Master! Master, I'm here!
Where else would he be going but to Dracula?
What is it, Master?
What do you want me to do?
Look, here's an opening.
Mina!
Mina!
I didn't lead them here, Master.
I didn't know. I swear.
No! No!
Wait!
I'm loyal to you, Master.
I'm your slave.
I didn't betray you.
Oh, no, don't! Don't kill me!
Let me live, please!
Punish me, torture me, but let me live!
I can't die with all those lives on my conscience!
All that blood on my hands!
Mina! Mina!
He'll kill her if we don't get to her.
We must not be too late.
We have him trapped. Day is breaking.
We have him trapped.
He's killing her.
Mina! Mina, where are you?
Mina. Mina.
Mina, where are you?
Mina.
Mina!
Mina! Mina!
Harker! Harker!
- Yes?
- Come.
Where? Where are you?
Here. Here, Harker.
I have found them.
Get me a piece of stone, anything.
It will help me drive the stake through their hearts.
Is she... How is she?
She is not here.
Then... Then she may be alive.
Mina! Mina!
Mina!
Mina!
Mina!
Mina! Mina!
Oh, John. John, darling.
I heard you calling, but I couldn't say anything.
We thought he'd killed you, dear.
The daylight stopped him.
Oh, if you could have seen the look on his face.
There's nothing more to fear, Miss Mina.
Dracula is dead forever.
No, no, no. You must go.
But aren't you coming with us?
Not yet, presently.
Come, John.
I've never heard a more beautiful Angelus.
Who is the bellringer of Notre Dame?
Quasimodo, Your Majesty.
The people simply call him the Hunchback.
What an odd name.
And now, Master Fisher, let's see what reason...
...my High Justice had for asking me to come to your shop.
What do you call this apparatus?
The German inventor, Gutenberg, calls it a printing press, Your Majesty.
What is it for?
To print books, Your Majesty.
-For whom?
-For the people.
They will learn to read when they can get books.
I can print a volume, like this one, in a few weeks...
...and quite inexpensively.
Imagine, Frollo, a few weeks.
When I ordered my prayer book...
...it took them years to copy it out...
...and cost me a fortune.
This is more beautiful than the printed book.
Nevertheless, the printing press is a miracle.
A horrifying miracle.
Horrifying? This small press?
Small things have a way of overmastering the great.
"The Nile rat kills the crocodile. "
This small press can destroy a kingdom.
Oh, come, my High Justice, don't exaggerate.
What is that?
It is the first page of a new book,
Your Majesty.
Let me see it.
"On the Freedom of Thought. "
-Who wrote it?
-Pierre Gringoire.
Gringoire? Who is he?
A French poet, Your Majesty.
A heretic, sire.
To spread him is to communicate disease.
How do you know?
It may be a great blessing to France...
...if people can get books and learn to read.
To me, it's a new form of expression of thought.
Out there is the old form.
All over France, in every city...
...there stand cathedrals like this one...
...triumphal monuments of the past.
They tower over the homes of our people like mighty guardians...
...keeping alive the invincible faith of the Christians.
Every arch, every column, every statue...
...is a carved leaf out of our history.
A book in stone...
...glorifying the spirit of France.
The cathedrals are the handwriting of the past...
...the press is of our time...
...and I won't do anything to stop it, Frollo.
Sire, we must break the press and hang the printer.
For, between them, they will destroy our old and holy order.
No, I'm not such a fool.
I, for my part, will protect France from these printed books, as I will protect it...
...from witches, sorcerers and Gypsies...
...the forelgn race that is overrunning all of Europe.
Why do you stop us?
Because no Gypsies can enter Paris any longer without a permit.
It's the new law.
-If the others can enter, why can't we?
-They are Frenchmen. You're Gypsies.
-Forelgners.
-Forelgners.
You came yesterday, we come today.
Let them pass. It's Fools' Day.
Fools' Day or not, we don't want these forelgners.
Stop her. Catch her.
What's the matter, Héléne?
Grandma, the Hunchback of Notre Dame just crossed my path.
Go home quickly, and light the candle.
That won't help against Quasimodo.
He's possessed.
Yvonne, aren't you going to the festival to see the king?
I can't. Mother says there are too many thieves and beggars in the crowd.
Oh, they'll get you at home just as well.
You'll see.
Well, what's he trying to do?
He has heard it rumored that the earth is round...
...and is attempting to walk to the Indies, the idiot.
-It's not round, it's flat.
-The idiot!
Some famous geographers and mathematicians also believe...
-...the earth is round.
-It isn't round, it's flat.
Do you recollect that letter we had from--
What's his name?
Oh, Christopher Columbus...
...who wrote claiming that he could, by steering a westerly course...
-...reach the Indies?
-It's flat.
I'm greatly tempted to endow the venture.
Our country could not afford the risk of such an enterprise.
Columbus...
The man's the laughingstock of the court of Spain.
Who knows...?
The future may prove Ferdinand's court was the laughingstock.
-It isn't round.
-What are you mumbling about, Doctor?
-The earth isn't round, it's flat.
-How do you know?
I have observed it on all my travels over Europe.
It's flat. Everywhere it's flat.
Oh, let's listen to the play.
"The old can never last.
"The new is claiming its place.
"It's foolish to cling to the past.
"Believe in the future's face.
"It pains me to relate that death...
"...is the fate of noble and peasant, alike.
"You are born in a womb.
"And end in a tomb. "
The king's coming.
Pennies...
Pennies...
-How's business?
-Bad.
How's business?
It would be better if all weren't watching the play.
-I'll tend to that.
-You'd better.
"You rest and live and rest again.
"Beware you do not live in vain. "
And if you eat too much, you throw it up again.
You stupid, ignorant drunkards, you!
I offer you truth...
-We don't want your truth.
-No, we don't want it.
We will now choose the King of Fools.
Applicants come forth. Men, women...
The ugliest face wins the crown.
Ugly faces!
Ugly faces!
How do you like this face?
The ugly is very appealing to man.
-It's a matter of taste.
-No, it's instinct.
One shrinks from the ugly, yet wants to look at it.
There's a devillsh fascination in it.
We extract pleasure from horror.
Only the mob, sire.
Think so?
Look at our friends.
They don't look exactly uninterested.
Horrible.
That's the prettiest ugliness
I've ever seen.
Awful.
Beautiful.
What?
That girl, what a beauty.
I've never seen her before. Have you?
She is pretty.
-Who is she? What's her name?
-Esmeralda.
The people seem to like her, and so do I.
-Doctor, lend me half a livre.
-A half livre?
-Afraid I won't repay you?
-She's a Gypsy, sire.
Who cares about her race?
She's pretty.
Doesn't she make your pulse beat faster?
What about you, Doctor?
I'm a widower four times, sire...
...but I could begin all over again.
What's the matter?
That eye...
...staring at me.
-Somebody's in there.
-It's an animal.
-It's a fiend.
-Come out, if you're a good Christian.
Let's get under there and see what it is.
Get him out of there.
-Get under. Get after him.
-He's going out the other way.
-It's Quasimodo.
-It's the Hunchback of Notre Dame.
Don't spoil thelr fun, Frollo.
Stay here.
Make him the king.
Well, Quasimodo, we knew you were ugly, but didn't know you were so ugly.
We've never been so close to you before.
You've always been up in your bell tower.
And now we want to make you
King of Fools. What do you say?
What's the matter? Are you deaf?
The plague to you. I offer you the fools' crown, and you bite me.
He's deaf, the bells have made him so.
Deaf...maybe he's dumb, too.
-That makes him the perfect king.
-No, he can speak.
-But he doesn't like to.
-Well, what will we do about it?
Show him the crown.
By unanimous vote, we now proclaim you King of Fools.
"King Quasimodo, Quasi-Quasimodo
"Quasimodo, ruler of fools we bow
"All you rabble, scum and scavengers of France
"Mark you the fool with crown upon his ugly brow
"Hail to the idiot king
Shout and sing
"Quasimodo, Quasimodo
King of the Fools is Quasimodo
"Hail to the king
King of the Fools, cock-a-doodle-doo
"Cock-a-doodle-doo, Quasimodo
Cock-a-doodle-doo, hey... "
I am the true King of Fools.
I battle for beauty, and the ugly gets crowned.
What greater fool can there be than I?
Stop!
He can't take away our king.
-No bills, only petitions.
-But I need money.
The actors must be paid.
The play was ordered.
-This is no time to ask for money.
-It never is.
So, we go hungry.
Here, don't push.
-Don't push.
-I must see the king. I must.
-Must?
-Hey, you Gypsy.
Let me see your city permit.
Catch her! Stop her!
Stop her!
Stop her!
Sanctuary.
We've got to arrest her. She's a Gypsy.
Church is sanctuary for all.
They can't enter Paris anymore.
It's the law now.
The power of the law ends at this threshold.
It's no use. The king himself could do nothing here.
Don't be afraid.
You are safe here.
What have you done?
Why are they after you?
I'm a Gypsy.
That's not your fault. It's an act of God.
Take her to the bell tower.
Quasimodo will look after her.
Quasimodo is not here, Your Grace.
-Where is he?
-I don't know, Your Grace.
Where is my brother?
His Grace is in the vestry, preparing for the evening service.
Claude...
-I must speak to you.
-What is it?
It's about Quasimodo.
He made a spectacle of himself before the king and all the people.
-Where is he now?
-Up in his tower.
You must impress upon him, again.
He must have nothing to do with anybody outside the church.
But you have more influence over him than I.
He's your foundling, Jean.
You picked him up on the church steps, not I.
Ever since he was a child, he has looked to you as his protector.
Quasimodo is back now.
I'll take you to him.
Who's that?
The Virgin Mary, the Mother of God.
The Mother of God.
If we open our hearts to her with faith...
...she comforts us.
How can I speak to her?
Kneel down and pray as the others are doing.
I've never prayed before...
...but the priest told me...
...you help all those who are in need.
Give me security. Give me happiness.
Give me always a good home.
Give me a rich husband.
Give me beauty.
-Give me a rich harvest.
-Give me prosperity.
Give me happiness.
Take all I have...
...but please help my people.
They are in great need, in great danger.
What are you doing in Notre Dame?
I'm praying.
You cannot pray here. You are a heathen.
Who are you?
You're not a priest, and yet you look like one.
I am what I wish to be.
-Get up and leave this church.
-No.
You desecrate the very stones on which you kneel.
-I?
-Yes.
First you dance publicly without shame, awakening in every man...
...the weak and sinful desire to look at you.
Dancing isn't sinful to me, it's like talking.
-Get up.
-Leave me alone.
Your hand...
There's the mark of the devil on it.
You witch!
For saying that, I shall have you hanged.
Now I know who you are.
Mother of God, don't let him hang me.
Protect me. Protect me.
Praying won't help you.
You come from an evil race.
You don't know anything about my people.
Honest people don't live by witchcraft and magic.
If we really had the power of magic do you think...
...we'd choose to be outcasts, to be poor and persecuted, always?
Surely we'd use it for our own benefit.
AII Gypsies should be destroyed by fire and sword.
You mustn't talk like that in here.
The Mother of God is listening.
I'm a heathen, yet I could be here all my life and never have an evil thought.
Never speak, just be here.
Look.
That window up there, glowing in red and blue...
...with the setting sun breaking through...
...and how the light floats around the tall columns.
They're like the high pines in the forest.
It is so quiet and peaceful here.
Almost quieter than in the woods...
...where the birds chatter and sing when I come.
You know, the birds and deer eat out of my hand.
They're not shy at all when you are kind to them.
I know.
You like animals?
Yes.
You say that?
You?
Then you cannot hate as much as you pretend to.
Somewhere in your heart there must be love.
I know...
I see it in your eyes.
God has shown me the goodness in you.
Surely he'll show me a way to help my people.
Mother of God, you know how Gypsies are cruelly driven from country to country.
So, you see, I have to speak to the king.
If he is kind, he will do something to help my people.
Please, do make him listen to me.
He will.
You will be heard...
...but you must give me a good reason.
-They tell me Gypsies are a lot of thieves.
-That's not true, Your Majesty.
Whenever we steal, it's because we're hungry.
My people have good hearts, and we love you.
You have a good heart too, sire, because you've promised to help us.
You little witch. I merely meant that I might consider it.
Where do you live?
Where shall I send you my answer?
To Notre Dame?
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Good.
Then I'll send my message here.
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
Thank you, Mother of God.
Thank you. Thank you.
I must go and tell my people.
-Wait.
-Why?
You live here in sanctuary, don't you?
Don't be so disturbed.
You'll enjoy living in the bell tower, high above all Paris.
I often like to go there, myself.
Come, let me show you.
The bellringer will watch over you.
Don't be afraid.
It's Quasimodo, the bellringer.
He's harmless.
Don't run away.
Come with me.
You beast, you monster! Let me go!
What have I done?
Let me go! Let me go!
Devil! You, unholy monster!
Let her go!
Help!
Help! Save her, save her!
-What's the noise?
-What are you yelling about?
There, it's the Hunchback!
There, the Gypsy dancer, he's running away with her.
Save her, save her!
That way, Phoebus.
Stop him, Phoebus.
Take her. Take the girl.
Where's everybody running to?
What's happened?
-The guards have caught someone?
-A criminal.
-Who is it?
-It's the Hunchback.
-Let me hang him.
-Leave that to the law.
Don't let him get away.
Tie him up well.
Stop that biting, or I'll knock your teeth out.
What's your name?
Esmeralda.
I'll remember it, and I'll see you again.
Come on, you beast! Come on!
Come on, go inside.
No, no. I'd better wait out here.
Never wait for a man, my dear.
-He'll come back.
-He will, sure as his name is Phoebus.
-Congratulations. So you got him.
-Thanks to your help.
-My help?
-Yes, you yelled loud enough.
I would arouse all Paris against such monsters.
Is the Gypsy girl your sweetheart?
Most special, my dear Captain Phoebus.
And remember, I will repay you, not she.
Pennies, sir...
Pennies, sir...
Pennies, sir...
Pennies, sir...
Where's the king?
He's busy now. You'll have to wait.
The moment I saw her, she went straight to my heart.
Esmeralda...
...you belong to us now.
Who's the king here?
I, and nobody else, give the kiss of initiation.
Many of our tribe have found this a haven.
You, too, will find peace...
...and a home here.
What's the matter?
He doesn't want to pay his daily share.
Come with me.
Leave him alone.
You know what the rules are.
Pay up your share or...
I'll give you a count of three to change your mind.
One...
...two...
...three.
-Who's that?
-A stranger.
They said they caught him prowling around the court.
How did he get in? Is the guard asleep?
Let me see him.
Bow down.
You're standing before the King of Beggars.
Who are you?
Permit me to introduce myself.
Maitre Gringoire...
...doctor of the seven liberal arts.
Do you know where you are?
The Court of Miracles...
...where the blind can see...
...and the lame can walk.
Do you know what happens to people who come in here uninvited?
-I can imagine.
-Let me hang him.
He's a spy.
He's a doctor.
I'm a poet, whose play was done at the festival.
Anyone caught here who's not a beggar or a thief, must hang.
No, no, you can't do this to me.
I haven't done anything.
-It's a rule.
-I'm not a spy. You can't!
No!
What a pity.
My ballad could make you immortal.
What?
What did you say?
-Say it again.
-I mean...
I mean, I...
I intended to write a poem in your honor, to glorify your relgn.
-Let me hang him, please.
-Quiet!
Are you trying to cheat me?
Keep me alive and you will live in history.
Imagine, my Clopin, in history.
Don't put your oar in.
Besides, I belong here naturally.
Being a poet, I'm already a vagabond, and I can learn quickly to be a thief.
And I will amuse you with such rhyming eloquence as you've never dreamed of.
Good intentions are not enough.
They've never put an onion in a soup, yet.
You'll have to undergo a test.
Then we'll see if you're good for anything.
Get the bellboy ready.
Bring him down.
And now then, up you go, up.
Stand on the stool. One leg.
-I'll break my neck.
-Then you'll save us the hanging.
Try to take a purse out of that pocket, but if one single bell jingles...
...you've failed.
-And then?
-Then you hang.
Can you do it?
I'm above that sort of thing.
I cut throats, I don't cut purses.
Try it.
Don't tinkle. Please, little bells...
...don't jingle.
My life...
...depends on you.
There must be something easier
I could...I could try.
Surely...
...get right up and take the bellboy's place.
Too bad.
And I'd almost come to like him.
Clopin.
Why not give him a chance to marry one of the girls?
Wait!
Let me hang him.
Girls...
Poet for sale, poet for sale...
Poet for sale...
What does that mean?
If one of our girls will marry you, you are free...
...and I can't hang you.
A charming idea.
Going...
Going...
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.
And thank you, my friend.
-Gone.
-Gone.
That neck.
Wait, wait...
Are you going to hang that man?
Surely.
Unless you take him for your husband.
I'll take him.
Well...?
What, do you want her or not?
My rope, my rope...
The wedding cup.
Take it from Esmeralda...
...drink and break it.
And he had such a nice neck.
Let's escort them to the bridal chamber.
"Ta-ra ta-ta, ta-ra ta-ta
Under the gallows tonight
"Ta-ra ta-ta, ta-ra ta-ta
Beggars are wed tonight
"Happy are the cats and mice
"Even the lice
"Ta-ra ta-ta, ta-ra ta-ta
Under the gallows tonight
"Ta-ra ta-ta, ta-ra ta-ta
Beggars are wed tonight
"Happy are the cats and mice
"Even the lice
"Jump and sing until it's light
"This is a beggar's wedding night. "
We must have a light.
Here is flint and tinder.
-Now, a little wood.
-Let me help you.
No, it's a woman's part to build the fire.
But it was a man who first brought it to earth.
Who?
-Prometheus.
-Who is that?
A god who stole it from heaven by holding a rod to the sun...
...until it burned into flames.
He created creatures out of clay...
...and blew his breath into them and they came to life.
Then, they too, could make fires...
...to warm thelr bodies.
As we do?
Just as we do.
Oh, Esmeralda, I feel...
How can I tell you how I feel?
This day, first people ridiculed me...
...then I found you...
...then I lost you.
And now...
...here we are together...
...married.
For such a miracle, I waited through the dark and endless night.
When before...
...my days I hated...
...now I welcome Phoebus light.
Phoebus, king of day...
Esmeralda...
What did I say to hurt you?
Nothing.
You must tell me.
Who is Phoebus?
Phoebus, the sun god.
The sun god.
Why do you ask?
I love a man named Phoebus.
Phoebus?
Not that captain who saved you from the Hunchback?
Yes.
So you don't love me.
It was nothing but pity, pity, pity.
I'm sorry if I hurt you.
Well, since you won't have me...
...have me as your husband, maybe you'll have me for your friend.
My friend?
Do you know what friendship is?
Like brother and sister...
...like two petals on the same flower.
And love?
That's to be two, and at the same time, one.
I love you, Esmeralda...
...so I am ready to live with you as it shall please you...
...as husband and wife, if you think good...
...or as brother and sister, if you like it better.
I'm enough of a philosopher to hold everything in the proper equillbrium.
-The what?
-The proper balance.
You're a juggler.
No, I'm sorry. I can't juggle.
But you can learn. I'll teach you.
Look.
That's wonderful.
I could never do it.
Try it.
It's no use.
Don't talk.
Balance it.
No use.
Something must have happened.
The whole court is...
What's the matter?
He has an order to arrest all the Gypsies.
No, only the girls.
Round them up, round them up.
Good morning, Your Honor.
What is it?
The Gypsy girls are ready for your inspection.
The one I'm looking for is not here.
Release them.
Did you find in which prison
Quasimodo is belng held?
-Not yet, Your Honor.
-Why not?
-Find out at once.
-Yes, Your Honor.
Quiet.
Quiet.
Speak up, prisoner. The judge is deaf.
Your name?
Your age?
Your profession?
Emile, have you...
...got all the prisoner's answers down?
You are accused of...
...disturbing the peace...
...abducting a woman...
...and resisting the king's guards.
What is your defense?
Quick and to the point.
Quasimodo.
So you plead guilty.
Twenty-five, next month.
For that, you shall be whipped.
Bellringer of Notre Dame.
Your Honor, the prisoner is deaf.
He hears nothing.
That's different.
For that insolence...
...you shall spend another hour on the pillory.
Next case.
"We hereby announce that Quasimodo, the bellringer of Notre Dame...
"...is to recelve 50 strokes with the cat-o'-nine-tails...
"...for his attack upon a woman.
"Thereafter, he will be exposed for one full hour to public disgrace. "
And to think that yesterday on the same spot...
...they crowned him thelr king.
Today...
That's life.
He's getting what he deserves.
If all the nobles got what they deserve, we wouldn't have enough pillories.
It's a shame, flogging that cripple.
Poor wretch.
Master Pierrat.
One...
...two...
...three...
...four...
...five...
I can't stand it, Clopin.
You could if you'd been whipped once.
-Have you?
-Twice.
Now I buy protection.
-From whom?
-The nobillty.
The guardians of the old and holy traditions.
The very same.
They buy it from the king, and sell it to those beneath.
It's quite all right.
You see...
...after the war, I don't forget, it lasted 100 years...
...thousands of us went from door to door asking for honest work...
...and we were whipped for begging.
The ruling class didn't say,
"Work or starve. "
It said, "Starve, for you shall not work. "
And I starved.
Thousands did, till I organized the Beggars' Guild.
Of which I am member 7, 419.
You needn't be ashamed.
True, we're not great thieves, like the nobles.
Our robberies are petty compared to the wholesale plunder of the nation.
I wonder if the moral difference isn't in our favor?
Right.
Some day you and I will write a book on the truth of beggary.
We will.
Right now we've got to do something to stop the whipping of that poor devil.
Only the chief of justice can do that.
Isn't the archbishop his brother?
I don't think he can do anything, but you might try him.
Twenty-nine, thirty...
...thirty-one...
That's no whipping.
He hasn't shed a tear.
Those possessed of the devil never do.
-It's the whipper's fault.
-What do you mean?
Our whipper would make him cry.
You mean you have a better whipper in Marsellles than we have in Paris?
Yes.
Why?
I know, I know, I know.
Isn't there any way to stop the whipping?
I wish I had the power.
Quasimodo belongs to the world of the church, doesn't he?
He does, yet if he ventures into the world outside, he must accept its laws.
If his punishment seems unjust...
...there is a higher power who watches...
...and avenges.
Forty-nine, fifty.
The prisoner shall remain for one full hour on the pillory.
The cellars of the Palace of Justice are overflowing with prisoners.
It is the same throughout France.
It's not the common thief and murderer...
...but the thousands, and thousands of heretics...
...freethinkers and preachers of sedition that are our problem.
We have to build more prisons.
It is not more prisons we need, it's more executions.
We're far too lenient.
What'd you find out?
The prisoner Quasimodo has already been sentenced.
-Where is he?
-At the pillory.
The council is dismissed.
Water...
Water...
Water...
Water...
Water...
Did you see that?
And I thought he loved the Hunchback.
Never trust a man with pinched nostrils and thin lips.
-Where have you been?
-With my people.
I crept through the gates to tell them that the king has promised to help us.
Water...
Water!
There's your water.
Claude, I couldn't prevent it.
Before I knew what was happening he was already sentenced.
What do you think, Jean, made Quasimodo pursue the girl?
He never did anything like it before.
He would not disgrace us...
...unless he was forced to.
I know how disappointed you are in him...
...but we must bear our burden in patience.
The hour's up. Release him.
All right. Go on.
She gave me water.
"Are we not all God's creatures...
"...placed in the center of the universe...
"...to rule with love as our Father in Heaven?
"The time has come to regard our fellow man with respect...
"...for only thus will we reach the fulfillment of our destiny. "
No wonder Frollo fears the printed book.
Imagine all the people reading this.
The printing press seems to be a great invention.
It is. I'm glad I'm living in this age of great beginnings.
You're hurting me. I should have made you my chief torturer.
I beg your pardon, sire.
I wouldn't have to rub so hard if Your Majesty would bathe more often.
-How often would you say?
-Twice a year.
-Twice a year?
-At least.
-Would that make me live longer?
-It would.
Good.
I am determined to live 100 years...
...and more, if your new elixir does what you promise.
What's the matter?
Why are the bells ringing at this hour?
And so strangely?
What's the matter with the Hunchback?
You see? It is Quasimodo.
He's getting crazier every day.
Yes, he certainly has changed.
What do you mean?
He's been different ever since that Gypsy girl gave him a drink of water.
That's right.
He keeps mumbling her name.
Maybe he's in love with her.
Is the lead hot enough to pour?
Who is she?
The Gypsy girl.
She's been invited to dance here tonight.
-Gringoire, what are you doing?
-The world looks beautiful this way.
One should always look at it standing on one's head.
-Be sensible.
-Sensible?
It is monstrous to be as sensible as I am.
Please remember why you are here.
To divert the noble lords and ladies of Paris.
Unless they take poison to end the ennui of thelr empty lives.
Are you ready?
Yes, I am.
Come on, Bimbo.
Don't forget your cue, Esmeralda.
What have I done?
Why do you pursue me?
What have you done?
You have awakened in me all that should have stayed dormant.
I have sought a tranquil existence, and had it.
Until I saw you.
Since then my powers have failed me...
...for I cannot rid myself of you.
In every book I read, I see your face.
In every sound, I hear your voice...
...or the jingle of your tambourine.
I've questioned my conscience through the deep hours of the night...
...only to awaken in greater confusion.
Let me go.
They are waiting for me to dance.
I don't want them to see you dance.
-You are breaking my wrist.
-I don't mean to hurt you.
Come away from here.
I can't bear it that all those men will see you dance.
I want you for myself alone.
If I can't have that...
...it will be my end...
...and yours.
Now, ladies and gentlemen...
...next in our program...
...the flower of Egypt...
...the dancing wonder, Esmeralda.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is really not Esmeralda.
This is Aristotle...
...the great mathematician.
The miracle goat.
He will tell any one of you how much money you have in your purse.
Very well. How much money have I?
Phoebus, isn't that the Gypsy girl?
Come, Fleur, let's all dance.
Well, Bimbo, this is no party for us.
Come on, Aristotle.
Who are you? Where do you come from?
Speak up. I'm a soldier and I'm accustomed to belng obeyed.
Here I sit and talk to you as if I had never seen a girl before...
...never held one in my arms.
Why do I do this?
Why?
-Because you love me.
-Because I love you?
Forever.
Forever is a long time.
You forget I am a soldier and gamble swiftly with life and death.
I am willing to throw my life away for you, today.
Tomorrow...
You see, love is only a part of my life.
It's a very sweet part, I admit.
For me, it is everything.
It's all my life.
There is someone here.
What is it?
Don't worry.
Phoebus...
...now I see...
...why Luna guards the night...
...for the soul to pray.
How I welcome Phoebus light...
...Phoebus, king of day.
-Say again you love me.
-I love you.
More than anything in the world?
I can't do any more than just love you.
-I can.
-You are a woman.
So you won't love me after tonight?
Perhaps not.
Let's get away from here.
There is somebody near us.
-I'm afraid.
-We'll stay, my love.
Murder!
Murder, murder!
Captain Phoebus has been killed.
Captain Phoebus has been killed.
Murder!
The Gypsy, she did it.
There's the knife. Arrest her.
Bertrand, Guillaume, why don't you stop him?
It's impossible.
We can't make him stop.
Something's happened to him.
He's going mad.
We've tried everything.
We can't even reach him.
Go and get more help.
We must stop him.
He'll awaken all Paris.
He's stopped.
-Jean.
-Claude.
-I've been looking for you.
-Good. I am glad you came.
We couldn't stop Quasimodo.
I thought he'd gone mad.
Where have you been?
I've been waiting for you all evening.
Oh, let's go down to my room.
I have a surprise for you.
I want you to hear some new music.
There's a young Italian composer.
He's written the most beautiful things, and you must listen--
What's the matter?
You may not want a murderer in your room.
What do you mean?
I have killed a man...
...out of love for a woman who has bewitched me.
I know she is the trap that Satan has set for me.
You are the servant of God.
You must help me.
Claude, speak.
"He that smiteth a man, so that he shall die...
"...shall be surely put to death. "
God also says, "I shall appoint a place where thee shall flee. "
I can't help a murderer.
Then she must die.
Who must die?
This Gypsy girl who has made me a murderer.
-But, she is not guilty.
-Yes, she is.
She has bewitched me.
Therefore, she must die.
Die for your crime?
That's devil's logic.
You can't believe that.
I do.
A sorceress once bewitched
Bruno de Firenze.
He had her burned, and was saved.
This girl's death shall be my redemption.
You're mad.
You can't commit another crime.
Your conscience won't let you.
There is no crime I would not commit to free myself of her.
Then my duty is to help the girl, not you.
Claude!
You are my brother.
I am no longer your brother.
Who's there?
Gringoire.
Darling.
You don't believe I killed him.
I know you didn't.
How's Aristotle?
-I have a cabbage for him.
-Thank you, for Aristotle.
Your hands are like ice.
You aren't afraid, are you?
Not now.
Oh, Gringoire...
Why did I ever come to Paris?
Don't cry, darling.
I keep thinking and thinking...
...how I came here to soften the king's heart toward my people...
...and how my own silly heart betrayed me.
-For that, I deserve to die.
-You will not.
I will get you free.
You will look after my people when I'm gone.
Don't talk like that.
Yes, darling.
Forgive me...
...even though it is too late.
For what?
About...
...Captain Phoebus.
Even before he was killed,
I knew he really didn't love me.
-I've been a fool.
-Don't speak of it.
-You're not angry with me?
-Never.
Thank you, Gringoire.
-I hear someone coming.
-Don't leave me. Don't leave me.
I must work to get you free.
-What is it?
-Quiet. I hear somebody talking.
It seems to come from over there.
Look, it's Quasimodo.
How can we save her?
How can we save her?
How can we save her?
Here, here is the appeal.
Quick, Master Fisher. Quick!
-We'll print it at once.
-To the people of Paris.
Not so fast. I must get the type ready.
How soon can we get the first 100 copies?
-Tomorrow.
-Good, good.
But, who will distribute them?
Every student, every beggar in the Court of Miracles will help us.
Let me see.
Parisians, day after day innocent people disappear.
Some die on the gallows, others are buried alive in dungeons.
By order of His Honor, the High Justice...
...destroy this devillsh apparatus.
You may destroy the form, but not the spirit.
Parisians, mark my words.
Today it is an innocent Gypsy girl.
Tomorrow it may be your brother or your children or yourselves.
Parisians, let us appeal to the king.
-Witness...
-Let us--
...this is not a public square.
If you do not observe the dignity of this court, I'll put you in prison.
Close the door.
Silence! Silence in the court.
Show them the evidence.
Witness, does this dagger belong to the Gypsy?
Yes.
Is it the dagger that killed Captain Phoebus?
How could she have killed a man so much stronger than herself?
It is obvious she was just trying to defend herself against the real murderer.
You know she's innocent.
These witnesses have proved it.
Sit down.
Silence. Silence in the court.
Your Honor, surely it's time to use the torture on this stubborn wench.
Not yet. Bring in the other prisoner.
Silence. Silence in the court.
Now the witchcraft is proved.
It is evident that the girl and the goat worked together.
I protest in the name of commonsense.
In the name of man...
...who's not to be judged by stupid superstition and prejudice.
Remove the witness.
It's a shame when the fate of a girl depends on the behavior of a goat.
If the goat doesn't know the human language...
...why don't the judges learn the goat's language?
Do you still deny that Satan is your master?
That you were sent to destroy man's body and soul...
...and deliver him into hell?
I am innocent.
Show her what she has to expect...
...if she refuses to admit her guilt.
It wasn't her.
If you want to know who it was, it was me.
Silence in the court. Silence!
Do you confess now?
I am innocent.
Your Honor, in view of the late hour, and the prisoner's attitude...
...there is nothing left but the torture.
Proceed. The court will adjourn.
What do you think?
She is as innocent as I am of killing the captain.
She'll confess under torture.
-They all do.
-I hate to see her hang.
-Is the doctor here?
-Yes.
Proceed.
Mercy...
Mercy...
Mercy...
Your Honor...
Your Honor, His Majesty, the king, is in the courtroom.
No, no. Let's stay back here.
I detest trials...
...but our archbishop has made my existence unbearable...
...with his appeals on behalf of this girl.
Your Majesty's presence here should satisfy His Grace.
Silence. Silence in the court.
Your Honor, the prisoner has confessed all.
Monsieur Procurator, we are ready to hear your requisitions.
Since the witchcraft is proved, and the crime exposed...
...we declare that we require penance...
-What is he saying?
-He's demanding the death penalty.
...before the great portal of Notre Dame...
...and a sentence by virtue of which this witch, together with her goat...
...shall be executed in Place de Notre Dame.
We will now take the vote.
Wait.
What's this?
Blood.
Did you confess under torture?
Yes, but...
...I am innocent.
You say you are innocent.
They say you are guilty.
I'll find out.
Untie her.
Come here.
Let us submit her to trial by ordeal.
Is this the dagger found in her hand?
Here is my dagger.
If you touch yours, you will be judged guilty.
If you touch mine, you will be innocent.
Blindfold her.
Choose.
The judgement is against you.
I'm sorry.
Gypsy girl...
...on such a day as it shall please our lord, the king...
...you are to be taken barefoot with a rope around your neck...
...before Notre Dame to do public penance.
Thereafter to be hanged on the gallows, together with your accomplice, the goat.
May God have mercy on your soul.
You've been kind to me.
I kneel before you...
...innocent of crime.
I believe you.
I cannot allow this girl to do public penance on holy ground...
...because she is not guilty.
Then she will hang without public penance.
You won't dare.
She is a witch and must die.
Take her away.
Sanctuary...sanctuary...
Sanctuary...sanctuary...
Thank heaven, the sanctuary will save her.
Oh, no, she killed one of us, and must die, regardless.
We will go to the king, and force him to suspend sanctuary.
Sanctuary...
But she's my wife. I must see her.
Not now. Believe me, she is safe here.
-But Quasimodo...
-He will not harm her.
-He did once before.
-That was not his fault.
Believe me she is safe now with Quasimodo.
Eat, eat.
I'm going away...
...so that you don't have to see my ugly face...
...when you're eating.
Come here.
You called me back.
I'm...I'm deaf, you know.
You would think there would be nothing more wrong with me, wouldn't you?
But I'm deaf, too.
It's horrible.
I never realized...
...till now how...
...ugly I am.
Because you're so beautiful.
I'm not a man.
I'm not a beast.
I'm about as shapeless...
...as the man in the moon.
I'm deaf, you know...
...but you can speak to me by...
...signs.
Why did you save me?
You...
...asked me why I saved you.
Oh, I tried to carry you off...
...and the next day you gave me...
...a drink of water...
...and a little pity.
Listen...
You must never leave the church...
...or they'll...
...hang you.
And that would kill me.
Yes.
It's good in the church.
It's high, high up...
Look...
People.
Look, little people...
Look, look.
Here...
Up here...
...friends.
Up there...
...babies.
Jacqueline.
Gabrielle.
Guillaume.
Big Marie.
She made me deaf, you know.
I can hear my friends.
Shall I play them for you?
I am proud to be the first to sign.
I never heard of such an outrage.
An imbecile hunchback takes the law into his own hands...
...and the king approves of it.
We will not be governed by the shouting of the rabble...
...nor can the judgement of our courts be willfully set aside by the church.
When the king reads this document...
...and sees the names of those who signed it...
...he will do away with sanctuary for all time.
Come, Frollo.
Your signature.
Your name will force the king to decide in our favor.
That girl must hang, and this resolution will seal her fate.
I have something to say to you...
What is it, my child?
Gringoire...
Every man in the Court of Miracles is ready to fight for Esmeralda.
Look at that new weapon.
With this, we save her.
We'll not let those nobles take away our right of sanctuary.
Don't bother me now.
I've got to finish this appeal to the king.
To the people.
-The printer's waiting.
-Words won't save her.
I have a better way: force.
I don't believe in force.
My friend, you are a dreamer, a scribbler, a poet.
What do you want?
To prove your point, or save Esmeralda?
The plague on you if you don't stop arguing like lawyers.
-Do something.
-Right.
-No, wait.
-Until they hang Esmeralda?
Gringoire, my army of beggars, thieves and cutthroats is ready to march.
No, no, no, Clopin.
-We must wait.
-What for?
For the effect of my pamphlet on the population of Paris.
But you forget the power of nobillty.
You forget that the king will read this, too.
He failed before when they destroyed the printing press.
I can't depend on pamphlets.
We march. Get ready.
And this pamphlet, you say, is belng distributed...
...by craftsmen and students throughout Paris?
Throughout the whole country, sire.
My craftsmen are awakening.
The result of your printing press, sire.
-If we had taken--
-Read on, read on.
"The people have faith in thelr king...
"...and are certain that so long as the courts...
"...continue to use torture instead of common sense...
"...he will refuse the nobles' demand...
"...to suspend the sanctuary of Notre Dame. "
A thrust at you, Frollo.
What's that?
Why are they gathering out there?
-Olivier.
-Sire.
What's going on?
The people fear the nobles' influence upon you, sire.
And have come here to make certain you will not suspend sanctuary.
What does all this mean?
It's the pamphlet, sire.
I see.
I see.
This poet is cleverer than I thought.
This bold new way of appealing by printed petition...
...is creating a sort of public opinion...
...that is forcing decisions...
...even on kings.
Impertinent...
...but I like it.
It's different.
Public opinion is dangerous, sire.
Dangerous for whom?
-Your Majesty, the archbishop has arrived.
-Let him come in.
Sire, the pledge of the sanctuary is belng threatened.
-Have you read this?
-I have, sire...
-...and all the people are aroused by it.
-Good, my people...
...do your work. Go on.
Destroy these false nobles who want to be kings.
Hang, pillage, sack them.
On, my people, on.
But, sire, the cathedral...
...Notre Dame--They will destroy it.
-What do you mean?
-Thousand of beggars...
...are afraid that the Gypsy girl is no longer safe in the church...
...and are storming Notre Dame.
That, I would not endure.
It's all your fault.
-My fault?
-Yes.
If you hadn't interfered with the execution...
...the girl would have been hanged and all would be well.
But, sire, the Gypsy girl is innocent.
The trial by ordeal was against her.
Still, she is innocent.
If you're so sure she is innocent...
...you must know the real murderer.
Who is it? Speak up.
Your Majesty...
Who is it you are protecting?
I am waiting for my brother to speak.
Oh, what is this, a personal matter between you two?
Who is it?
-It's the Hunchback!
-No.
Then who is it?
Who is the murderer?
I am.
I did it, and I would do it again.
I don't understand.
He's madly in love with the Gypsy girl.
And he condemned her to death?
Because she didn't love him.
Frollo, a murderer.
-Who are you?
-Maitre Gringoire.
Oh, the man that wrote the pamphlet.
I would talk to you.
Arrest Frollo. Quick, quick.
Come in, come in.
I, Clopin, king of the beggars...
...summon you, Archbishop of Paris...
...to give up the Gypsy girl.
We've come to save her from the nobles who want to hang her.
Open the door, Archbishop of Paris...
...or we'll break into your church.
What's all this about?
-Who are you?
-Craftsmen.
-Craftsmen?
-Citizens of Paris.
We have all read
Maitre Gringoire's pamphlet...
...and are here to defend the sanctity of Notre Dame.
No one shall violate it.
-Not even the nobles?
-Not even the nobles.
I don't believe you.
Charge!
People...
They've come to hang you.
But I'll keep them away.
If you don't leave here...
...they can't catch you.
No one can get in here.
I wouldn't let them.
If you are afraid...
...pull the rope.
I can hear the bell.
What's the matter? Are you all cowards?
You can't let those thieving nobles hang an innocent girl.
She's one of us. Come on, fight.
You're not afraid of a stick of wood, are you?
Where's your courage, beggars?
Come on, we'll save her! Set her free.
Come on! Fight!
Don't slink away like frightened rats.
What are you afraid of?
There's no demon up there.
That's only Quasimodo, the bellringer.
We should thank him...
...for furnishing us with a battering ram.
Come on, lads, do your work.
Come on, lads!
Forward!
Forward, lads.
Parisians...
Parisians...
...she's free.
We won.
The king has pardoned her.
Disperse and go your ways in peace.
The girl has been pardoned...
...and all her people are free to live anywhere in France.
We've won.
Why didn't you wait?
I told you I could save her without using force.
I thought that was just a poet's dream.
Don't thank me. Thank Quasimodo, who saved you from hanging.
And Gringoire, whose little printed papers set you free.
Your Grace.
Why was I not made of stone like thee? www.surrealmoviez.info
Are you bad luck!
Hiya, Doctor.
Hiya, babe.
- Hey, where are you going?
- Inside, inside.
No, you ain't.
Only stiffs go in there tonight.
- No kidding.
- No kidding.
- What's keeping you out?
- I'm... What?
- Listen, we're pals, ain't we?
- Yeah.
Get a flash of that.
Yeah, well, it won't do you any good tonight.
Now, look, I got me orders.
Nobody's going in there, and that goes for you newspaper guys, too. Now...
Sergeant, all I want to do is identify a body.
Now, look, walk down the street, because somebody might think I know you.
- Go ahead.
- That's an idea. Bones.
- Hello, Dee.
- Hello.
- Say, say, what's the hurry, big boy?
- I just want to use your telephone.
Oh, yeah? Well, there's one down at the corner drugstore.
Listen, I haven't got time.
Will you be a sport? Come on, act natural.
All right, but step on it.
This is no telephone exchange.
Haven't I...
Say, didn't I meet you in Havana?
Yes... What?
Hello, World?
Give me the night desk, please. Yeah.
Willard Keefe. Yeah, this is Lee Taylor.
I'm down at the Mott Street Morgue.
Just now they bring in the body of an old scrubwoman murdered under very peculiar circumstances.
No, they won't let me see it.
I can't get any dope. Police...
Very good. I say very... What?
I say I can't get any dope on it.
Police orders.
Just now, Stevens, O'Halloran and a guy named Dr. Xavier arrived.
- Something's doing.
- Yeah, I've heard that one, too.
Listen, you lunkhead, I'm not clowning.
Look out the window, will you?
- What do you mean, the moon?
- Certainly I mean the moon.
I'm laying 10 bucks to a dime it's another Moon Killer murder.
Well, that's different.
Now, listen, Lee, stick right on it.
Fine.
I thought I...
Oh, Rachmaninoff.
How about the Prelude, huh?
Hey, Mike, just a minute. Please!
Hello, Mike. Hey, listen, what's going on across the street tonight?
I don't know a thing, Lee.
I'm walking my beat and minding my own business.
- Well, have you got a cigarette?
- I never use them.
Here, smoke this. Paddy, the bartender down at the corner, gave it to me.
- Oh, much obliged, Mike. Thanks!
- Yeah, no problem.
- Good gracious! What you got there?
- Nothing, just a little handshake buzzer.
You see, fits right in the palm of your hand.
You wind it up like that, and it discourages these professional handshakers.
I ought to have one on each hand for my beat here.
- Well, I gotta be going now. Goodbye.
- So long.
I forgot all about that thing.
Don't ever bring any of those darned tricks around here again.
What's your theory, Doctor?
Strangulation by terrifically powerful hands.
You will notice how deeply the thumbs are embedded in the sternocleidomastoid.
And what do you think of this incision at the base of the brain?
Obviously made by some type of scalpel used for brain dissecting.
But it's peculiar that this left deltoid muscle should be missing.
- It's been torn right out.
- Gentlemen, it wasn't torn.
This is cannibalism.
- This portion of the body was...
- Impossible!
There's no doubt about it.
Thank you, Doctor.
I appreciate your professional opinion.
I'm only too happy to be of any service to you, gentlemen.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have rather an important experiment in progress that demands my attention every few hours.
I hardly think I can be of any further use to you, so if you don't mind, I'm very, very sorry, but I'll say good night.
Just a moment, Doctor, if you don't mind.
One thing more.
- Very well, sir.
- Yes, what?
Now, look here, Doctor, this is the sixth murder in the same number of months, all committed in the full of the moon with no apparent motive, by means of strangulation and an incision with a strange surgical knife.
- Yes, it is peculiar, isn't it?
- Most peculiar.
- What's your theory of the killer, Doctor?
- A neurotic, of course.
- Some poor devil suffering from a fixation.
- Fixation? What do you mean?
A knot or kink tied to the brain by some past experience.
A madness that comes only at certain times when the killer is brought in direct contact with some vivid reminder of the past.
- It's hard to believe that.
- Yes, for a policeman, I suppose it is.
But I tell you that locked in each human skull is a little world, all its own.
Yes, well, what would these reminders be, for instance?
Anything. The sight of the sea, the full moon. Anything.
The poor devil, sane at all other times, is forced to live over the scene of the action that first drove him mad.
Very interesting.
Particularly in view of the fact that all these murders occur in the vicinity of your medical academy.
Are you implying that someone in my academy could have done this?
- I am convinced of it.
- This is preposterous!
I'm familiar with the character of every student and professor, and they're all men of the highest integrity.
There are other academies in the state...
But they don't have that kind of knives.
The surgical supply house swear they import them from Vienna especially for your institute.
It's the only place in the country that they're used.
Commissioner Stevens, if you jump at a hasty conclusion like this, you'll ruin the integrity of an institution that has one of the finest reputations in the world.
I'm sorry, Doctor, but I have to start an investigation.
I tell you this first, because I'm hoping for your cooperation.
Naturally, I shall do everything to protect your institution.
- But the newspapers, the publicity.
- Don't worry about them.
We don't want publicity any more than you do.
If my academy is under suspicion, give me a chance to conduct an investigation of my own first.
Surely, with our knowledge of the human brain,
- we have every facility to catch a madman.
- How would you proceed?
By immediately studying the pathological reactions of every man placed under suspicion.
Then trap the guilty one by a brain examination.
May I examine the records of your students and faculty?
Why, assuredly, assuredly. You can come to my office now, if you wish.
But, I beg of you, no publicity, please.
- No, don't worry.
- Please.
Not one newspaper in the country shall hear of this until you've had every opportunity to clear your academy of suspicion.
Thank you. Thank you.
I appreciate your gesture.
What is it? What do you want?
- Father!
- Oh, it's you, Joanne.
What is it, dear?
Nothing. I just came in here to say good night to you.
Father, what are you doing in here in the dark? You frightened me.
I'm sorry, Joanne.
I just came here to get those records.
It's late. You're looking very tired, darling.
You're only heading for a nervous breakdown unless...
That moon, mixed with this other light, it's too ghastly.
Father, you worry me.
You promised me you'd take a rest.
Lately you've been so...
No, my dear, I'm all right.
Just a little nervous, that's all.
Now, I have some gentlemen next door in the office.
- You run along. I'll be through shortly.
- But, Father...
Now, Joanne, please.
This is very important.
Good night.
But, really, gentlemen, this investigation is useless.
The academy is closed.
The students are away on their vacations.
It surely isn't wise to spend your time on this.
What's that?
Probably Professor Wells.
He's in his laboratory.
What's he doing here if the school's supposed to be closed?
It's not an unusual thing for the faculty to spend their evenings here at this time.
Vacation period is the only opportunity they have to do their personal research work.
What's the history of this man?
- Well...
- I'm waiting, Doctor.
Professor Wells is a student of cannibalism.
He's written a book about it.
Why didn't you tell us this before?
It's as good as a conviction.
I hardly think so.
I'm very fond of Dr. Wells.
He couldn't possibly do a thing of this sort.
- May I talk to him?
- Why, certainly. Certainly.
Come this way, gentlemen.
What a very strange, uncanny place you have here, Doctor.
What are all these doors?
They are the laboratories of my faculty.
Dr. Wells, Dr. Duke, Dr. Rowitz, Dr. Haines.
And all those men are here at this hour of the night?
They seldom leave.
They live for their work.
After all, this is a research institute.
I should like to have a little talk with these gentlemen.
Of course.
I'm sorry to disturb you, Professor Wells, but I would like to introduce some friends of mine.
- May we come in?
- Of course, of course, gentlemen.
Come in. Come closer.
- This is Mr. Stevens. Mr. O'Halloran.
- Professor, how do you do?
How do you do?
That's interesting, isn't it?
If this experiment is successful, we will be a little nearer the secret of life.
What is that?
That's a heart.
I've kept it alive for three years by electrolysis.
Electrolysis?
Professor Wells is accomplishing remarkable findings in nerve reflexes.
- You flatter me, Doctor.
- Oh, no, no.
I understand, Professor, that you live just for your work,
- that you seldom leave the institute.
- Not necessarily.
I played truant a short while ago. I was down by the waterfront for a breath of air.
- What time was that?
- You're not feeling well?
- Your arm is troubling you?
- Yes, it's very annoying.
Well, you're foolish to sit there in discomfort.
- lf you gentlemen don't mind, I...
- Why, of course not, of course not.
I put it on just as I heard you coming.
An empty sleeve is revolting to most people.
Well, I think we've taken up enough of Professor Wells' time.
- Oh, not at all, Mr. Stevens.
- Thank you, Professor.
Well, gentlemen, shall we be going?
There are many other interesting things to see.
Yes, let's be going.
- Good evening.
- Good night. Thank you for calling.
You know, this is a tough case.
There isn't much chance of his strangling anybody with one hand.
- Oh, I agree with you.
- Well, that lets him out of the picture.
- Whose room is that?
- Professor Haines'.
Is there anything about him that might justify my putting him under observation?
Well, of course, if you're just looking for someone to hang suspicion on, there's not a man on my faculty that wouldn't come under that heading.
Then, you do know something about this man Haines.
- No, not exactly, except...
- Except what?
- Well...
- Come on, come on.
Well, what is it?
Dr. Haines and two other scientists were shipwrecked off Tahiti about a year ago while making a study of the coral reefs for the Killary Foundation.
Now what's that got to do with it?
- You say they were shipwrecked?
- Yes, they were adrift for 24 days.
Their supplies were exhausted.
When they were picked up,
Haines and one other were delirious.
The third had vanished.
There was no explanation at the time.
Haines later claimed the man had died, and he had thrown the body overboard.
- I should like to meet him.
- Surely.
But I am sure that he's not the guilty party.
The killer is a maniac, and Dr. Haines is one of the most brilliant men in the medical world.
- However, if you insist...
- I do.
Very well.
Professor Haines?
Yes. Yes, yes, come in. Come in, Doctor.
I want you to meet
Mr. Stevens and Mr. O'Halloran.
They're making a tour of scientific investigation and intend to honor our academy for a short time.
- How do you do, gentlemen?
- Hope we're not disturbing you, Professor.
Not at all. I was just relaxing.
Professor Haines is a most intensive worker.
I've just been telling Mr. Stevens of your phenomenal experiments in brain grafting.
Oh, Doctor, Doctor, come.
Come. I want to show you.
I want to show you a new type of brain cell.
- That should be interesting, Professor.
- I'm sure you'll find it so.
- On the slide?
- Yes.
Look.
Relaxing.
Why did you bring the police in here?
Get them out quickly, or I'll...
Professor, do you experiment with all these animals?
Mankind's benefactors.
Those little animals whose blood most nearly resembles the human.
Yes. Yes, yes, of course. Of course.
But it's getting rather late, Professor, and Mr. Stevens wants to see the rest of the laboratories.
Now that he's met you, he can call some other time.
- Delighted.
- Thank you, Professor.
- Glad to have met you. Good night.
- Good night.
Good night, gentlemen.
There's always a certain amount of danger in a laboratory so...
He's certainly a strange type.
Well, such men are naturally strange,
Mr. Stevens.
Sometimes in the overdevelopment of one part of the brain, another part is weakened.
There's a type who looks capable of anything.
Oh, I assure you, he's as timid as a lamb.
He's inclined to be attentive to my daughter, so I see a lot of him.
- Who's the next?
- Dr. Rowitz.
He's the scientist who was with Haines during the shipwreck.
If you'll step this way.
- Are you busy, Dr. Rowitz?
- Always, but it's a pleasure, gentlemen.
Oh, excuse me.
Mr. Stevens. Mr. O'Halloran.
- How do you do?
- How are you?
- Can I be of any service?
- Well, we are just looking around, Doctor.
- Oh, yes, of course.
- Good evening, Professor Duke.
- How are you feeling tonight?
- Horrible.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
Well, if it makes you feel sorry to hear things like that, then don't ask questions.
Oh, Professor Duke,
Mr. Stevens, Mr. O'Halloran.
How do you do? How do you do?
He's Dr. Rowitz's collaborator.
You're an astronomer, Doctor?
Not that, sir.
I have an interest in the light qualities of the moon.
If you might suffer sunstroke, might you not suffer some similar evil
- from the rays of the moon?
- Moonstruck, you mean?
Exactly, what we call lunacy, from the word luna, meaning the moon.
Latin, you know.
However, the luna rays will never affect you or me, sir.
- Because we are normal people.
- Sure.
It affects strangely certain neurotic types.
Yes, moon is powerful.
Why, twice a day it lifts billions of tons of water at high tide that wash the shores of the world, like an eternal old scrubwoman.
Like what?
Pardon my poetic effort.
Yes, but just what do you mean by that?
I'm afraid we've taken up too much of Dr. Rowitz's time.
Thank you, Doctor.
That was very, very interesting.
- Good night, gentlemen.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
You know, this is the doctor's particular hour for observation, and the moon doesn't wait, you know.
Did you notice the face on that fellow?
That sailor who saw the scrubwoman killed tonight says the murderer had a face that was horribly disfigured.
Rowitz certainly fits the description, all right.
Gentlemen, I don't believe that Dr. Rowitz could commit a crime.
He has such a lovely nature.
Why, he's the author of several volumes of poetry.
Hello?
- What are we gonna do?
- We're powerless unless he helps us.
You know that as well as I do.
We've exhausted every clue.
He can help us find the murderer, if anybody can.
And I'm gonna put plenty of pressure on him and make him do it.
A little nervous perhaps, but nothing more.
Oh, ridiculous.
All right. All right.
You go back to sleep, dear.
Good night.
Doctor, if I permitted you to conduct your own investigation, how long would it take you?
If you leave me alone,
I can conduct a series of tests, which in 48 hours will conclusively prove whether or not the killer is a member of this academy.
In the meantime, I should like to check up on all your collaborators.
Who's there?
Hey, what're you doing up there?
I'm a building inspector.
I work nights so I won't get sunburned.
I asked you what are you doing up there?
I'm a somnambulist. I probably came up here to have my head examined.
You come down from there, or I'll...
Now, just a minute,
I'll be right down, honey. Just relax.
Everything is gonna be all right and on the up-and-up.
I'm not used to these.
These fire escapes are a sideline with me.
Now everything is gonna be...
There's nothing to worry about.
See, Police Commissioner Stevens is upstairs, and I'm taking care of the outside.
- By the way, what are you doing here?
- I'm Miss Xavier.
And we're not accustomed to having strange men climb all over our fire escapes.
I'm not accustomed to having strange girls sticking guns in my stomach.
By the way, you're just the person I wanna see.
I wanna ask you a few questions.
Could you tell me the whereabouts of your father during the last four hours?
How do you spend your evenings?
I mean, have you ever noticed the Doctor acting strangely?
I'm sorry, but I can't answer those questions.
The Doctor hasn't been very well lately, and I don't like policemen or anyone to disturb him.
- Good night.
- Just a minute.
- Have you got a permit to carry that gun?
- Yes, I have.
Good night.
All right. I'll agree to lay off for 48 hours.
But I give you my word, if you don't succeed,
I'll come in here, seal every door, place everybody under technical arrest, take fingerprints, conduct a rigid inspection.
I don't care if the whole world knows it.
There have been six murders committed all in the same circumstances.
The evidence points here.
- But, Commissioner, all I want is a chance.
- You've got it.
- Forty-eight hours. Good night, Doctor.
- Good night.
Good night, gentlemen.
Meddling fools.
This way out, gentlemen. If you please.
- Who're you?
- I am Dr. Xavier's butler, sir.
My nerves are all shot.
That dumb, potbellied, flat-footed cop.
I dashed that off in five minutes.
I think it's pretty swell.
- What do you think?
- It's okay.
But you stick on Dr. X's trail, and you get a picture of the Doctor and a statement, too.
Oh, no, not me.
Listen, I wanna get off this story.
Put me back on crossword puzzles, covering woman's clubs,
- anything, will you?
- Say, what's the matter with you?
What's the matter with me? Nothing at all.
Only I spent all last night laying next to a bunch of stiffs, looking at a lot of goofy guys.
I let a dame poke a gun in my stomach, and then I let a dumb policeman slip me a trick cigar.
Say, you want to draw another paycheck, don't you?
Certainly, that's my aim in life, but I'd like to keep out of the bughouse to enjoy it.
Eddie, when is Lee Taylor's week up?
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Can't you take a joke?
All right, keep moving, but get a picture of the Doctor.
Here, have a cigar.
How do you do? I'm Mr. Taylor.
- You ain't a reporter, are you?
- I should say not.
Well, that's good. We've been overrun with them all morning.
- Gee, they got us goofy.
- I know just how you feel, Miss Xavier.
- I ain't Miss Xavier.
- Well, that's funny.
I was told that she was a good-looking girl of about 20.
I'm 21-and-a-half.
Oh, fine. Pleased to meet you.
Gee, ain't you the kidder, though.
That's another thing in your favor.
That shows that you have a sense of humor.
What do you want the miss for?
- My grandmother sent me.
- Your grandmother?
Won't you take these flowers?
- For the miss.
- Come in.
Just a minute.
Miss Joan, there's a man down here wants you for his grandmother.
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, how do you do?
I didn't know you... I'm awfully sorry.
You know, I felt sure that
I'd hear you coming before you entered.
Well, I suppose I could go back and cough.
Oh, no, no, please don't bother.
Stay right here.
- You're sure I'm not disturbing you?
- Not at all. Why do you ask?
You're so obviously at home here that I feel like a guest.
- You don't mind if I sit down?
- Oh, please do.
Oh, how nice. Thank you.
And since you're my guest, won't you...
- Won't you want a cigarette?
- No.
What I want is to know if you're really going to take it.
- Going to take it?
- Yes, my picture.
It's sticking out of your right pocket.
Well, isn't that the funniest thing?
You know, this is really all your own fault.
You have absolutely no business photographing so attractively.
- Thank you.
- And I have a habit of collecting pictures
- of beautiful girls.
- Yeah.
- Well, and pictures of their fathers, too?
- Pictures of their fathers...
What fathers?
My father's picture's sticking out of your left pocket.
Well, can you beat that?
How do you suppose that got there?
Just who are you, anyway?
Because you're such a good scout,
I'm gonna break down and confess and tell you.
I'm Lee Taylor of The Daily World.
- Then you did it.
- Me?
It was you who printed that horrible story of Father in this morning's paper.
- Horrible? You ain't read nothing yet.
- What do you mean?
What I mean is... Well, don't you see?
Your father's a famous scientist.
He's been called in on a sensational case.
- That's news.
- But you've upset him terribly.
Now, on account of that newspaper story, he has to go some other place to carry on his investigation.
- He hates publicity.
- You mean to tell me he's leaving town?
Who's going with him?
What time are they leaving?
- What station...
- That's none of your business.
I refuse to say another word to you.
You're just contemptible and impudent enough to publish it.
Oh, impudent, maybe, but not contemptible.
- Don't call me contemptible.
- You are contemptible.
You deliberately fooled me last night into believing that you were an officer.
Well, I merely showed you my police press badge.
Don't you think you've been here a very long time?
Listen, honestly, I am ashamed.
But don't you see?
This is the biggest thing that's happened in this town in six months.
If I don't get something on this story, why, I'll have to join the army of the unemployed,
- and you wouldn't want that to happen.
- I'd be very grateful to you if you'd leave.
I didn't quite get that.
Yeah, would you say it again?
A little closer.
You hard of hearing?
No, no, but don't you see?
That's the closest thing to anything coaxing that you've said yet.
- You get out of here.
- Oh, don't be angry.
Come on, let's laugh it off.
- Won't you shake hands and be friends?
- No.
Lucky.
I've got to get something on this story, or I'm out of a job.
Hey!
Take this home to your grandmother.
Bad luck.
There is no need to be temperamental.
We are here on a matter of the utmost gravity.
That's why I've sent for you so unceremoniously.
We are all under suspicion of murder.
- What?
- Absurd.
- Ridiculous.
- What imbecile thought that up?
Gentlemen, I know you're all acquainted with these recent horrible murders.
Moon Killer murders, as the press calls them.
The investigation has proven that, in every case, the killer has made use of a surgical instrument, a type to be found only in our academy.
- But, Doctor...
- One moment, please.
Naturally, I prefer to believe that everyone in this room is innocent, but circumstances point to the conclusion that one of us may be guilty, any one of us.
Confound it, Xavier.
Bring us up here on a night like this.
Why couldn't you have told us this at the academy?
For a simple reason.
I wish to conduct an investigation of my own, alone, quietly.
And I want your help.
This is a lot of tommyrot.
Don't you realize what the publicity of a police investigation would mean to us?
You are quite right, Doctor.
What do you propose to do?
I want every one of you to submit to a psycho-neurological test, an experiment that I have devised, which I hope will prove each one of us innocent.
But if it should prove otherwise?
Then, my dear Doctor, surely one's own farewell to life is preferable to that demanded by the law.
- This is preposterous. I refuse.
- Good. Then the police will give it to you.
Gentlemen, I consider it a privilege to have an opportunity of proving my innocence.
- Doctor, I'm ready.
- Thank you, Dr. Rowitz.
- Dr. Wells?
- Yes.
- Professor Duke?
- I agree.
- And you, Professor Haines?
- Well, if they all agree.
- Good.
- Oh, I think it's a lot of nonsense.
Gentlemen, I suggest you all retire to your rooms and unpack.
In 10 minutes we shall all meet in the laboratory.
A still?
Wonder where they bottle it.
Bad luck.
You and me both.
Very well, Doctor. At once.
Your room is at the end of the corridor.
Mine's over there.
I just fixed yours for the night.
Is there anything else, miss?
Why, Mamie, what's the matter with you?
Your teeth are chattering.
This terrible house.
It gives me the horrors worse than ever.
Well, don't be absurd.
Go to bed and go to sleep.
Well, I hope you get a good night's sleep.
- Good night.
- Good night, Mamie.
Good night.
Come, Mamie. Come.
Come, Mamie.
How would you like to meet a ghost in here, eh, Mamie?
Well, I'll tell you one thing.
He'd be a lot pleasanter than you.
Stop that, Otto.
Stop it.
There ain't anything in this room to be afraid of.
So you can just stop trying to make me nervous.
Well, well, Mr. Zilch, how are you?
The smells, don't they remind you of an embalming parlor, eh, Mamie?
The only thing in this room that does that right now is you.
Yes, you can laugh now, if you want to, but you won't laugh tonight when you have to wear these for the experiment.
- Where did Dr. Xavier get that?
- From the morgue.
The old scrubwoman wore these the night that she was murdered.
Look, Mamie, look here.
You can see some of the blood on them.
- No, Otto! No, please, Otto! No, no!
- Look, Mamie. Look, Mamie. Yes.
- I take back what I said, please.
- Look, Mamie, look.
Otto, Mamie, what's wrong with the switchboard? What's going on here?
- Nothing, sir.
- Yes, there is, Doctor.
- He's trying to scare me.
- Otto, stop this foolishness.
- Yes, sir.
- Now, pay attention, both of you.
- You have the dress, Otto?
- Right here, sir.
Mamie, you'll kindly put it on.
- Put in on? But, Doctor...
- Now, I want your help.
You and Otto will enact the last murder of the so-called Moon Killer before an audience I've selected.
Otto knows all about it and will instruct you in your part.
- What part do I play?
- The scrubwoman, of course.
- The one who was murdered last night.
- Murdered?
But, Doctor, please, please.
Couldn't Otto play it?
No, Otto has his own part, that of the killer.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Remember our signals, Otto.
Just as I explained.
Yes, sir.
You see, Mamie, there's nothing to be afraid of. There's nothing...
How've you been, babe?
Now, cut it out, now, will you? Cut it out.
You're right.
There's nothing like this way.
How utterly absurd.
Good heavens, Doctor, what have you done with your laboratory here?
It's nothing like it was at my last visit.
- I've made a few changes, that's all.
- A thousand, I should say.
Thermal tubes, huh?
A blood reaction, by high frequency current, as well.
Dr. Xavier is still working on his theory that strong mental repressions, phobias, hidden in the darkest corners of the subconscious mind can be brought to the surface and made to register through certain reactions of the heart.
- Am I correct, Professor?
- Precisely.
And tonight I hope to prove my theory.
Now, gentlemen, would you kindly be seated in these chairs?
We'll begin the experiment.
Well, if we must, then let us get it over with quickly.
Dr. Rowitz, Dr. Haines and Professor Duke.
And now, gentlemen, with your permission,
Dr. Wells will assist you in clamping these contact wires to your wrists.
Are yours included?
Certainly.
As close as possible.
But, see that the connections aren't too tight. You'll be quite comfortable.
Pardon me a moment, Doctor, as I attach the contact clamp.
That's it. Thank you.
Did I have to come all the way down from the city to play guinea pig for you?
I'm sure you'll forgive me in just a few moments.
- We're ready, Professor.
- The moon.
Perfect.
- Just as though we'd ordered it.
- Close those curtains.
Give me the shivers.
Moon shining right in my face.
- Oh, no, no. No, leave them alone.
- Close them!
- Shall I?
- All right, you may close them, Wells.
Now, listen, please, to what I have to say.
One of us in this room may be a murderer.
A murderer who killed by the light of a full moon, leaving his victim's body mutilated.
A cannibal.
Evidence shows the killer has two hands.
Therefore, only Wells is eliminated.
So I shall ask him to work the apparatus.
Wells? Wells? How about me?
A hopeless paralytic.
Silence, please, Professor.
Wells, will you take your place outside in the recording cabinet?
Yes, Doctor.
I'm going to leave you for a moment now, while I check the variability of your blood reactions.
I suggest that you remain silent during my absence.
Wells, the young quack.
Had him for an intern before he could grow a beard.
If you ask me, I think Dr. Xavier is using very unethical methods.
Necessity has no ethics, sir.
Gentlemen, I am now turning on the 100-milliampere, high-frequency coil.
Your pulses are connected with the magnetic rotators, and each variation of your heartbeat reaction is amplified 4,000 times.
The rotor of the electrostatic machine is connected in multiple series with a bank of glass-plate condensers, and the discharge causes irradiations to the thermal tubes, which, in turn, indicate your increased pulse rate and nerve reactions.
We can proceed now.
One moment, Doctor.
Were the murdered women attacked?
Does your mind never run into any other channel?
What do you mean by that statement?
I mean that your sadistic tendencies may someday carry you too far,
Dr. Haines.
- You, you...
- Silence, gentlemen, please.
Now, it is my theory that one of us in the past, through dire necessity, was driven to cannibalism.
The memory of that act was hammered like a nail into the mind of that man.
Shrewd and brilliant, he could conceal his madness from the human eye.
Even from himself.
But he can't conceal it from the eyes of the radio sensitivity.
Every time his heart beats from mental excitement, the thermal tubes will betray him.
You are all now connected with these tubes. I am myself.
But I alone know which tube is yours.
Your heart beats are being reflected before you.
Doctor, I protest!
As the heart beats faster and faster, so does that red liquid begin to pulse and rise until terror takes hold of the subject, and the liquid rises to the very top of the tube.
He whose tube does that is the guilty man.
Here are a line of wax figures, lifelike reproductions of the pitiful victims, people whose lives were snuffed out and whose bodies were torn to satisfy the desires.
First, a woman of the streets, killed in the tenement district.
Her body found late at night in a gutter.
The next victim, a middle-aged woman, killed just before dawn as she was on her way to market.
Her bleeding body found under a dock by the waterfront.
Then, a dope fiend, strangled and mutilated in the doorway of a dance hall.
Next, a beautiful young girl, violently killed as she lay on a hospital bed recovering from an illness.
Oh, I'm so afraid. I'm shaking like a leaf.
Keep quiet. Get ready.
Watch.
You're about to see reenacted the murder of the killer's latest victim.
An old scrubwoman.
She's coming home from work. It's late.
A full moon shines down upon her.
She's passing through an alleyway when suddenly a terrible figure steals out, starts creeping towards her.
As old Annie stoops to pick up a newspaper, the figure suddenly takes her throat in his powerful hands.
Get your hands off me, Otto.
You're hurting my throat.
- Turn on the lights!
- Someone's coming in the room!
Stop it, stop it, I can't stand any more!
Xavier, turn on the lights!
I can't get my breath.
- The lights!
- Look at that tube.
It's a success. The guilty man is...
The guilty man is Rowitz.
Rowitz. Look, what's happened to him?
- He's been murdered.
- Let me see.
What's the matter? What has happened?
Stabbed in the base of the brain.
Murdered like all the other
Moon Killer victims.
- Who was sitting on his left side?
- I was, but I didn't see anything.
I was watching the experiment.
Duke, you're walking!
I walked. You saw me.
You saw me, I walked.
I walked.
- You walked? You faker, you killed him.
- Quiet, Haines.
Don't you recognize hysteria reaction when you see it?
- Otto, help him.
- Take it easy, Doctor.
You'll need all your strength for your work tonight.
Wells? Where's Wells?
The contacts are broken.
Why doesn't he come in?
Take him to another room.
Wells! Wells!
Wells! Wells!
Wells!
Wells! What's wrong, man?
I don't know. The lights went out.
Someone called my name.
I started for the laboratory, and someone struck me.
Oh, this is terrible!
Easy, now. Let me help you.
I will be all right in just a moment.
Watch your head.
Are you sure you heard no one approaching the room when we started the test?
No one. Nothing unusual happened until I was struck.
Father, something terrible has happened to Dr. Rowitz.
- I just saw him...
- Now, Joanne, dear, be calm.
Dr. Rowitz has met with an accident.
- I wish you'd go back to your room.
- He's dead?
You can't do anything here, Joanne.
It's best that you go back to your room.
- Your father will explain everything later.
- Now, come, Joanne. Come.
Doctor. Doctor.
- What is it, Haines?
- There's someone hiding in this closet.
What?
Another one? Who is it?
He's the young man who was at the house today.
He fainted.
- Some water, Otto, quickly.
- Yes, sir.
I took the liberty of having something on hand
- for just such an occasion, sir.
- Thank you.
Here, young man, drink this.
How's that, huh?
It's not bad. How much do you pay for it?
He's all right now.
What were you doing in that closet?
- Hiding.
- Who are you?
Lee Taylor, The Daily World.
You wouldn't give me a break, so I had to take it.
- You're lying.
- Don't be absurd.
He is a newspaper man.
He's the one who printed the story about you in yesterday's World.
I'm sorry. You see, I had to get the story.
I was hiding in there, and everything was going great, when all of a sudden, well, I guess I just fainted.
It's gonna be kind of tough if I have to lug smelling salts around with me the rest of my life.
Yes, well, newspaper man or not, you're an impostor.
I don't like your methods.
I shall hand you over to the police.
- Otto...
- That suits me.
I'll phone my story in from the police station.
- You'll phone no story.
- Father, let me talk to him, will you?
I can't let this story get out now.
It'd ruin everything.
But, Father, please let me talk to him.
Mr. Taylor.
Just in case.
- You're not gonna let him go?
- Certainly not. Otto, watch him.
Don't let him get near a phone or leave this house.
Yes, sir.
Oh, no, no. I'm absolutely all right.
Now don't...
Don't you worry about me.
I gotta dash off to my newspaper.
- See, they won't wait.
- Mr. Taylor.
You don't have to report to the paper what you've just seen, do you?
I'm sorry, but I've got to.
You see, this is the most sensational case that's broken in six months...
I know. But can't you wait?
Won't you give Father a chance to find out who's doing it?
What difference does it make to the public what happens or how he does it so long as he catches him?
It makes a lot of difference.
The public want to read about it.
The more sensational it is, the more the son-of-a-guns love it.
Is that all you think about?
Sensationalism?
Don't you ever think about people's feelings?
Can't you realize what a scandal would do to my father's institution?
Certainly I can, but don't you realize that I'm in a hard-boiled racket?
Then, why don't you help us instead of making it so much more difficult for us?
Aren't we going through enough trouble?
Look at the trouble I've been through to get this story.
I lay down at the morgue with a bunch of stiffs.
I looked at a lot of goofy guys.
I let a dumb policeman...
Will you at least stay the rest of the night and talk it over with Father in the morning?
I tell you what I'll do.
I'll hold off on this story, and I'll stay, if you let me have breakfast with the family in the morning.
I think it can be arranged.
Father usually has breakfast at 7:30.
- And you?
- Oh, I am lazy. I have mine at 9:00.
Oh, you have no idea how lazy I am.
- Could I have mine at 9:00?
- Possibly.
And will you take me for a swim afterwards?
- A swim?
- At the beach.
If you're so helpless you can't find the water, you've no business in it.
But I like the water and...
I am sorry, miss,
I had no intention of disturbing you.
That's okay, Otto.
- There's old man bad luck again.
- I am sorry.
That's all right, Otto. I'm glad you're here.
Mr. Taylor's staying for the night.
I'd like you to prepare a room for him.
I have already done so, miss.
May I suggest that you do not disturb your father any further tonight?
- He is very tired.
- That's a good idea, Otto.
Are you going swimming with me in the morning?
No, thanks. Good night.
What will you do if I start to sink and yell for help?
Throw you an anvil. Good night.
This way, sir.
- Do you sleep very soundly, sir?
- Like a rock.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Why?
Because this is a very strange house.
- You're telling me.
- This way, if you please.
Father.
Father.
Father?
Father!
Joanne.
What are you doing here?
Well, dear, I just wanted to be sure that the incision was made by a brain scalpel.
Come.
- Professor Haines.
- Haines, why are you here?
I couldn't sleep.
So I came down here to make a more thorough examination of the body.
Professor, I...
Father, will you please come to bed?
All right, darling, now, you run along, and I'll be right up.
- Good night.
- Good night, dear.
Professor, since we retired, this body has been...
- It has been...
- I know, but I don't want her to know.
What are you laughing about?
Oh, I know. This.
"Hate, friendship, love."
I don't blame you. It's so banal.
Like those postcards you buy. You know?
- Yes.
- About "I wish you were here," and "Two little doves billing and cooing."
Oh, no, really.
I was just thinking of something.
Of what?
- Come on, let's go in the water, shall we?
- Oh, no, no, no. Oh!
Water and I are not very good friends.
No, listen, when was a little kid,
I was very, very delicate, see?
- But very good looking.
- Yeah?
Yeah, well,
I won a first prize in a beauty parade.
- A baby parade at Asbury Park.
- How sweet.
But my mother was constantly dunking me in a tub of water, and I would get soap in my hair and in my eyes and my thing.
And water and I are not very good friends.
So, let's stay right here, huh?
Why not?
- There's somebody watching us.
- Where?
Look.
Oh, this is a terrible place.
I wish I were away from it.
If you only knew the things that have happened.
Listen. Forget that I'm a newspaperman.
I wouldn't betray your confidence.
Don't you see the only thing
I'm concerned about is your safety?
Are you worried about your father?
Yes, I am, terribly.
I wouldn't be. He's very tired.
He's working under a terrific strain.
- He's bound to show it.
- I know.
But last night, after everyone went to bed,
I saw my father bending over
Rowitz's body.
I saw... Oh, it's a terrible thought.
Oh, snap out of it.
Let's get dressed, and we'll...
Oh, we'll have breakfast.
That's right.
Well, I'll let you know, your eyes...
Your eyes are so blue, when I look into them...
That's right, Mamie.
You drink it, and you'll go right to sleep.
Nothing's going to hurt you.
She'll be all right as soon as this sedative has taken effect.
But the Doctor will be mad if I can't go through with it.
No, Father knows you're sick.
Of course he won't be angry with you.
Don't you worry about the experiment.
I'm sure the Doctor will make other arrangements.
I can't do it. I can't.
Something tells me if I go in that room tonight, tomorrow I'll be in my coffin.
Now, now. You just be quiet and forget about everything.
Oh, Miss Joan, something horrible is gonna happen.
I feel it in my bones.
Last night I dreamed
I was walking up to a casket, and when I looked inside, it was me.
Here, now, now, now.
You'll be getting hysterical again.
You'll be all right. Just go to sleep.
In the morning you'll feel fine.
I think we'd better leave her alone, Joanne.
No, Miss Joan, please don't go.
I don't wanna die.
I'm too young to die.
I've got too much to live for.
No.
- How's Mamie?
- She'll be all right. Don't worry.
- Thank you, Dr. Wells.
- It's quite all right.
What's become of that newspaper fellow?
Have you seen him?
Not since dinner.
He went directly to his room.
I've been looking for him everywhere.
I have a feeling that he's sneaked out and phoned the story of Rowitz's murder to the papers.
Publicity of that sort would ruin everything.
I don't think he'd do that.
He gave you his word.
I asked you not to let him out of your sight, dear.
- Why don't we look in his room?
- Oh, will no one obey me anymore?
Bad luck.
Skull, crossbones.
Death.
Hello?
- Oh, yes.
- Did you find him, dear?
- No, not yet, Dad.
- He's right here, sir.
- For me?
- The Commissioner of Police, sir.
Thank you.
- Hello, Commissioner.
- Look here, Doctor,
I've decided to send an undercover man up there tonight when you start your tests.
No, there won't be any tests tonight.
You'll have to give me another 24 hours.
Well, the woman I was depending upon was taken sick this afternoon, and it spoils all my plans.
Well, I'm sorry, but if things have gotten beyond your control,
I'm coming down there right away to take charge.
I'm in a tough spot.
I've got murder enough already to explain to the press and public.
- And if you think for a moment...
- One moment, Commissioner.
The 48 hours aren't up yet.
Well, I have to make some other arrangements.
Hold your men up just a little longer.
Give me one more chance, please.
All right!
I'll give you until midnight.
If you haven't got your man then,
I'm coming down there and slap the whole place under arrest.
Yank you all up to headquarters whether you like it or not.
Father, I want to help you.
You can't count on Mamie.
- Let me take her place.
- You?
No, I couldn't ask you to do that, Joan.
But please, Dad.
You get a squad car down to Blackstone Shoals at midnight, sharp.
Yes, sir.
Put the signal button on the control table and attach the wires to the thermal tubes.
Yes, Doctor.
What's the meaning of all this paraphernalia? Idiotic nonsense.
These chairs are too far apart to protect us from each other.
The contacts have all been checked.
You'll be ready in just a moment.
- Thank you, Wells.
- Doctor,
I still think you're making a mistake using Joanne in this experiment.
After all, gentlemen, this is my daughter's own suggestion.
I have no fear for her safety.
She's a sensible girl and knows what she's doing.
Yeah, and if she were my daughter, she wouldn't be up there on a bed in nothing but a nightgown just to satisfy some lunatic's experiment.
Professor Duke, don't criticize Joanne for her state of undress.
This argument is irrelevant.
Doctor, you forget that last night there was a murderer at large in this room.
And the murderer is still here.
I'm convinced.
But I've taken precaution against that.
You will each of you be handcuffed to your chairs, and you'll notice that each chair is bolted to the floor.
I refuse to submit!
You'll have us in straightjackets next!
I won't sit here handcuffed while you're running around loose.
I intend to be handcuffed also.
That will assure us there can't possibly be a repetition of last night's tragedy.
Oh, Wells.
They're very becoming to you, Haines.
It is time to get ready.
Aren't you afraid, miss?
There's only one thing I'm afraid of, Otto.
That's Father's health.
He's been working so hard, and lately he seems so strange.
The human mind will only stand so much.
We are all a little strange up here.
That's why I want Father to get away from here.
He needs a long rest.
He's promised me that just as soon as this is over, he'll go abroad with me.
You are right, miss.
Don't be afraid tonight.
Be sure you keep your eyes closed.
And relax.
Is that all, Doctor?
Yes, everything's set.
Now, go to the electric cabinet and do exactly as I told you.
Throw on the current the moment you are ready.
Yes, sir.
Doctor, has it ever occurred to you that Wells is free to do as he pleases?
I've guarded against that also.
Wells wishes to be treated the same as we are.
- Otto.
- Yes, sir?
Bolt all the doors so that no one can get in.
- The rest you know.
- Yes, sir.
Here are the keys.
Synthetic flesh.
Synthetic flesh.
And now you are about to witness one of the most gruesome crimes of the Moon Killer.
The death of Florence Johnson.
Murdered and horribly mutilated as she was lying weak and helpless on a hospital bed.
It's midnight, a private room at the Arch Hospital.
The nurse leaves the room for a moment.
The girl is alone when suddenly...
When suddenly the Moon Killer appears.
He crosses softly to his victim.
It's the killer!
- The killer!
- The killer!
Fight him off, Joan!
- Joanne!
- Wells, Wells.
Otto! Wells!
You idiots are calling for Wells? lt'll do you no good! There isn't any Wells!
Look, the keys. Well, take them.
It's Wells.
- Wells!
- Yes, it is Wells. But a new Wells.
A Wells whose name will live forever in the history of science.
Go! Run, Joanne! Run, run!
Joanne, get up, run!
The keys. The keys. The keys.
Look at his hand. Horrible!
Yes, look at it, a real hand.
It's alive. It's flesh.
Synthetic flesh.
For years I've been searching to find the secret of a living manufactured flesh.
And now I found it.
You I think I went to Africa to study cannibalism?
I went there to get samples of the human flesh that the natives eat.
Yes, that's what I needed.
Living flesh from humans for my experiments.
What difference did it make if a few people had to die?
Their flesh taught me how to manufacture arms, legs, faces that are human!
I'll make a crippled world whole again.
Doctor, your name will be remembered.
You've given your life, everything to science.
All but one thing, and now you're gonna give even that to science.
Your daughter.
Oh, if only I were not powerless here in chains.
Run!
Fight him off, Joanne!
Fight him off. Save her!
Joanne! Run! Run!
Club him! Club him!
- Joanne!
- Where'd he go?
Oh, Father! Father!
- Joanne!
- Oh, Father.
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm not.
- Lee!
- Yes.
- Lee!
- Wells. Where's Wells?
What happened to him?
Calm down. He won't ever come back.
I hit him with a lamp.
It was a long throw, but...
You know, I used to be a first baseman in high school.
You know, that old peg over to third.
Take a look at him.
- Are you hurt, Lee?
- I'm all right.
Are you okay?
Oh, I'm so glad. Because you... I want to...
I better keep my mind on my work.
You say you can't understand me?
I'm talking too fast?
You'd be talking fast, too, if you'd been through what I've been through.
Boy, am I out. Now listen, listen, Willard,
I want you to give Dr. X full credit for trapping him.
Dr. X. Now I'll call you back in five minutes with more details.
More to follow, more to...
Oh, Mr. Taylor.
I can't tell you how grateful I am for all that you've done for us.
Oh, you've got my heart going a mile a minute.
Your heart? Oh, I'm so glad.
Wait a minute.
Take this to the society editor.
It is rumored that, on her return from Europe,
Miss Xavier will have a very important announcement to make concerning a very promising and prominent young newspaperman.
More later.
Say, tell me how in the world did you ever overpower that terrible monster?
Oh, I...
In the third round, I found out that he was very ticklish in a certain spot.
But I haven't found your weakness.
- Don't you know?
- You don't mean...
Come here to me.
Oh, Mr. Taylor.
English
Trying to teach me a lesson in patience, Sir Joseph?
Method is everything in archeology, my boy.
We always deal with our finds of the day in order.
Well, it seems to me that that box we dug up today, with the very peculiar gentleman, over there, is the only find we've made in the past two months that'll bring this expedition any medals from the British Museum.
We didn't come to dig in Egypt for medals.
Much more is learned from studying bits of broken pottery than from all the sensational finds.
Our job is to increase the sum of human knowledge of the past, not to satisfy our own curiosity.
That's all very true, Sir Joseph, but after all, we're human.
And a find like this...
Well, how can you wait?
This is your first trip.
I've been out here 10 years, and I'm more curious about that mummy than you are, and even more about that box.
Whemple.
Yes?
The viscera were not removed.
The usual scar made by the embalmer's knife is not there.
I guessed as much, Muller.
I had a good look at him when I photographed him.
Never saw a mummy like that.
Neither, I imagine, has anyone else.
Looks as though he died in some sensationally unpleasant manner.
The contorted muscles show that he struggled in the bandages.
Buried alive.
"Imhotep,
"High Priest of the Temple of the Sun at Karnak."
Poor old fellow.
Now, what could you have done to make them treat you like that?
An execution for treason,
I suppose.
Sacrilege, more likely. Look.
The sacred spells which protect the soul in its journey to the underworld have been chipped off of the coffin.
So Imhotep was sentenced to death not only in this world, but in the next.
Maybe he got too gay with the vestal virgins in the temple.
Possibly.
The priestesses of the Temple of Karnak were the daughters of the reigning pharaohs.
They were the sacred virgins of Isis.
Maybe the answer's in that box we found buried with him.
I see I shall get no more work out of you until after it's open.
Come on. Let's have the box up there.
The wood's so rotten, it'll fall apart at a touch.
Whatever it is, it's terribly heavy.
Metal.
Looks like copper.
It's gold.
I say! Look here.
The unbroken seals of the Pharaoh Amenophis.
Some temple treasure.
"Death, eternal punishment
"for anyone
"who opens this casket,
"in the name of Amon-Ra,
"the King of the Gods."
Good heavens!
What a terrible curse!
Well, let's see what's inside. Wait!
You have read the curse.
We recognize your mastery of the occult sciences, Muller, but I can't permit your beliefs to interfere with my work.
Then why did you send for me this afternoon?
As a friend and an expert.
Because I saw this find was unique, and I wanted your opinion on it.
It is providential that you did.
Come, Dr. Muller. Surely a few thousand years in the earth would take the mumbo-jumbo off any old curse.
I cannot speak before a boy.
Come out under the stars of Egypt.
Do not touch that casket.
Go on with your cataloging.
We'll open it later.
You needn't think you can persuade me not to examine the most wonderful find of my whole experience out here.
If you're right about the legend, then this casket may contain the Scroll of Thoth from the holy of holies in the temple.
And I can hardly wait to get back to find out.
The gods of Egypt still live in these hills, in their ruined temples.
The ancient spells are weaker, but some of them are still potent, and I believe that you have in your hut the Scroll of Thoth itself, which contains the great spell by which Isis raised Osiris from the dead.
Put it back. Bury it where you found it.
You have read the curse.
You dare defy it?
In the interest of science, even if I believed in the curse,
I'd go on with my work for the museum.
Come back with me, and we'll examine this great find together.
I cannot condone an act of sacrilege with my presence.
What's the matter, man? For heaven's sake, what is it?
He... He went for a little walk.
You should have seen his face.
Here's something to break the monotony.
There's a visitor coming up the trail from the Nile.
Color? Nationality?
How could I see in that glare?
Well, Whemple, back we go to London.
And what fools we look.
Money wasted. Hole after hole dug in this blasted desert.
A few beads, a few broken pots.
A man needs more than hard work for this game.
He needs flair. He needs luck, like your father.
In the days when he used to come out here, there wasn't so much competition.
When he did, he found things.
And once, 10 years ago, he found too much.
Was it 10 years ago?
Queer story, that young Oxford chap he had with him going mad.
You know what I think it was?
No. What?
I think he went crazy, bored beyond human endurance, messing around in this sand and these rocks.
He was laughing when your father found him.
He died laughing, in a straitjacket.
Your father never explained.
But when the best excavator
England has turned out, a man who loved Egypt, said he'd never come back here, that meant something.
Come in.
You break your season's camp,
Professor Pearson?
Your colleagues have returned to London?
Yes. Whemple and I stayed behind to clear up.
Your expedition has not been a success.
Scarcely. Here are the season's finds.
Permit me to present you with the most sensational find since that of Tutankhamen.
This is very sporting of you. May I ask why?
We Egyptians are not permitted to dig up our ancient dead.
Only foreign museums.
Well, what's this?
Part of the funerary equipment of the Princess Anck-es-en-Amon, daughter of Amenophis the Magnificent.
Yes. It's her name.
I found that not 100 yards from where we are.
You mean, you think her tomb is there?
I will show you where to dig.
I'm sure it's very good of you, Mr...
I didn't catch your name.
Ardeth Bay.
Circumstantial evidence.
Not very strong, perhaps, but if we put that gang of diggers from Kerna on the job, we can tell in two days if there's anything here.
In one day, Professor.
It's a step!
He was right.
Anyhow, we found something.
The name of
Anck-es-en-Amon.
We will cable your father in London.
He must be here when we examine this great find.
The seal of the seven jackals.
And it's unbroken.
No one has entered this door since the priests of the royal necropolis sealed it.
3,700 years ago.
Is there a view like this in all the world, Helen?
The real Egypt.
Are we really in this dreadful, modern Cairo?
Your thoughts are far away from the dance and these nice English boys, my dear.
Not really.
I'm having a lovely time.
I'm so grateful.
But why?
For your keeping me here with you, of course.
So I don't have to go up to
Father in that beastly hot Sudan.
It's I who am grateful, my most interesting patient.
Know who that is?
Muller of Vienna.
Really?
Always spends his winters here.
Authority on the Egyptian occult.
Yes, but the girl.
Helen Grosvenor.
Her father's Governor of the
Sudan. English, of course.
Her mother, Egyptian. Some old family with a tree a mile long.
She's staying here with
Dr. and Mrs. Muller.
Pardon me, sir. Our closing bell has rung.
I did not notice the time.
I am addressing
Sir Joseph Whemple?
Yes.
I am Ardeth Bay.
Indeed!
Why, we have you to thank that we have this exhibit here at all.
The museum should be kept open all night in your honor.
Won't you come down to my office? I'm working here late.
Your pardon. I dislike to be touched.
An Eastern prejudice.
Won't you sit down?
You know my son.
Ardeth Bay. Where did you disappear to when we opened the tomb?
I returned to Cairo.
But... But now
I must not detain you.
But I must see you again.
You... You must come to my house.
I regret I am too occupied to accept invitations.
He's a strange one.
But you might at least have thanked the man.
He was responsible for finding the princess.
Yes. I rather wish he hadn't been.
I think it's a dirty trick, this Cairo
Museum keeping everything we've found.
That was the contract.
The British Museum works for the cause of science, not for loot.
Anck-es-en-Amon.
Anck-es-en-Amon.
Is anything the matter?
Anck-es-en-Amon.
Where do you want to go, miss?
Le Musée des Antiquités.
Imhotep.
Anck-es-en-Amon.
Anck-es-en-Amon.
Imhotep.
Imhotep.
I must get in.
Anck-es-en-Amon.
I must.
It's closed for the night.
Everybody's gone home.
I must get in.
Imhotep.
Imhotep.
Imhotep.
What's she saying?
What language is that?
The language of Ancient Egypt, not heard on this earth for 2,000 years.
And the name of a man unspoken since before the siege of Troy.
Is your master at home?
Yes, efendi.
Tell him Dr. Muller wishes to see him, urgently.
How did I get here?
We brought you here.
Father and I.
You fainted.
But how did you guess she was here?
I discovered that she took a taxi from the hotel to the museum.
I went there. The watchman said she had left in your car.
Before you take her away, I must talk to you about something she said just now.
Oh, Dr. Muller.
So, here you are, my dear.
I suppose you introduced yourself.
No?
Miss Helen Grosvenor, my old friend
Sir Joseph Whemple, Frank Whemple.
This seems so formal under these peculiar circumstances.
And now, if you're all right again, back we go to the hotel.
I... I think she ought to rest a few minutes.
Frank, will you make yourself agreeable?
Well...
Where was I when I fainted, Mr. Whemple?
Oh, outside the museum.
What was
I doing there?
Well, I wouldn't know that, would I?
No, I don't suppose you would.
I wish I did.
You see, I was waiting...
Let's not talk about it.
Oh, right.
You're partly Egyptian, aren't you?
Yes. How did you guess that?
Oh, I don't know.
Just something about you.
You know, I'd have liked Egypt better if I'd met you there, but no such luck.
Stuck in the desert for two months, and was it hot!
That tomb!
What tomb?
Surely you read about the princess.
So you did that.
Yes.
The 14 steps down and the unbroken seals were thrilling.
But when we came to handle all her clothes and her jewels and her toilet things...
You know, they buried everything with them that they used in life.
Well, when we came to unwrap the girl herself...
How could you do that?
Had to. Science, you know.
Well, after we'd worked among her things, I felt as if I'd known her.
And when we got the wrappings off, and I saw her face...
You'll think me silly, but I sort of fell in love with her.
Do you have to open graves to find girls to fall in love with?
I say!
Now I know what it is about you.
There was something about her head...
I had never mentioned the name, yet I heard Miss Grosvenor mutter, in ancient Egyptian, something about Imhotep.
Imhotep?
What was this Ardeth doing in the museum?
Looking at the mummy, just at closing time.
Hello.
What?
Come.
A museum guard found dead in the room of the princess.
So he died of shock.
We find this in dead guard's hand, Sir Joseph.
Probably thief try to steal it.
Guard take it away, thief kill him.
The cause of death,
I not find nothing.
Looks like an attempted theft, but nothing stolen here could be disposed of.
What is the document?
Let me put this here.
You'll be more comfortable.
Thanks.
You really want to know why I didn't take you to the hospital?
Because when I held you in my arms...
Hadn't you better not commit yourself?
What girl could fail to make a conquest who collapsed at a man's feet in the moonlight?
Oh, I know it seems absurd when we've known each other such a short time, but I'm serious.
Don't you think I've had enough excitement for one evening, without the additional thrill of a strange man making love to me?
But I've never been serious about this sort of thing before.
Now, look here.
You can tell me to go to the devil, but you can't laugh at me.
The curse has struck her, and now, through her, it will strike my son.
Quiet.
Frank, will you come to your father's study?
Helen, I shall take you home presently.
I'll be back in a minute.
Imhotep was alive when that mummy in the museum was a vestal virgin in the temple.
Thirty-seven hundred years ago!
What's that got to do with us, now?
Your assistant, who went insane and died, as you might have done if you'd seen what he saw, made a transcription of part of that scroll.
Yes. I have it still.
You seem to think this thing has all the devils of Hell in it.
Why not burn it and be done with it?
An excellent suggestion.
What became of the mummy of Imhotep?
Somebody stole it.
Look here, Dr. Muller. What's the matter with Miss Grosvenor?
You still think that that mummy was stolen, Sir Joseph?
Yes, I...
Oh, I don't know.
A thousand pardons.
I am Ardeth Bay.
I'm Helen Grosvenor.
I called to see Sir Joseph.
He's in the study.
A conference?
If I might perhaps wait.
Yes. Of course.
Have we not met before,
Miss Grosvenor?
No, I don't think so.
I don't think one would forget meeting you, Ardeth Bay.
Then I am mistaken.
But you are of our blood.
As to that,
I am not mistaken.
Yes.
My mother was Egyptian.
You must burn the Scroll of Thoth.
I tell you, it's the museum's property, not mine.
Who's out there with Miss Grosvenor?
Ardeth Bay.
He's come for the scroll.
Ardeth Bay,
Dr. Muller.
I accept your invitation, but I find no solitary student with his books.
I fear my visit is inopportune.
On the contrary, we were just talking about...
Me?
Your native Egypt.
You know
Miss Grosvenor?
Ardeth Bay introduced himself.
Won't you be seated?
Sir Joseph was just wondering how you knew where the tomb of the Princess
Anck-es-en-Amon was hidden.
Partly inference, partly chance.
Sir Joseph, you seem disturbed.
Yes. A tragedy at the museum after you left.
Tragedy?
When I was there?
When you were there,
Miss Grosvenor?
Yes. They told me I went there and tried to get in after it was closed.
I don't remember, but...
Helen, it is very late.
Frank, will you please see
Helen back to the hotel?
Certainly, if Miss Grosvenor will let me.
But I don't want to go.
After what happened, you need rest badly.
But I don't.
I was tired, but I...
Why, I've never felt so alive before.
Then as your doctor,
I must order you to go.
I'm not a child.
Yes. Please, come.
Then, Ardeth Bay, au revoir.
But we must see each other again.
I shall be honored.
An unusual crime.
A guard killed by a man who left a gift to the museum.
A gift?
A scroll.
Part of which was transcribed when it was first found.
Here is the transcription.
I cannot read the writing of a period so remote.
But you read the name of
Anck-es-en-Amon on that piece of pottery.
That was of the 18th Dynasty.
These are Predynastic ideographs.
The scroll from which this was copied was stolen 10 years ago, together with the mummy of the High Priest Imhotep.
Most interesting.
May I see that scroll,
Sir Joseph?
We left it at the museum.
So.
I have something else to show you. A photograph.
Why do you show all this to me?
Do you think it conceivable that the mummy was not stolen, but restored to a semblance of life by the spell from the Scroll of...
That scroll is my property.
I bought it from a dealer.
It is here in this house.
I presume in that room.
We had foreseen this.
The scroll is in safe hands, and will be destroyed the minute it is known that harm has come to us.
You have studied our ancient arts, and you know that you cannot harm me.
You also know that you must return that scroll to me or die.
Now tell that weak fool to get that scroll, wherever it is, and hand it to his Nubian servant.
The Nubian!
The ancient blood.
So you have made him your slave.
If I could get my hands on you,
I'd break your dried flesh to pieces.
But your power is too strong.
This is the evil force that has been attacking her.
Burn the scroll, man.
Burn it!
It was through you this horror came into existence.
It's true.
It's true.
Your father destroyed the scroll, knowing that it would cost him his life.
What's that?
Isis, the Egyptian symbol of life.
I meant it for your father.
What good could that old charm have done him?
I tell you, the doctors say it's a plain case of heart failure.
The Nubian is missing.
He's an old servant. He was frightened, but he'll be back.
Don't try and make me believe that this
Ardeth fellow is a mummy come to life.
It was that idea and the horror of it that killed my father.
The museum guard died of natural causes, too.
Frank, I need your help.
I saw your attraction to my patient last night, and hers to you.
Hers to me? Do you really think so?
And I welcomed it.
But do you think
I have a chance?
'Cause I think she's the most...
But this is terrible at a time like this.
Frank, I'm afraid. Will you go with me to her now?
Yes.
Then telephone her first not to leave the hotel.
No, I'm not going out.
Yes, I promise to wait until you get here.
Goodbye.
And I'm so dreadfully sorry.
You know...
What were you doing, Doctor?
Your father did not burn the Scroll of Thoth. That creature has it now.
But the ashes in the fireplace.
They were newspaper.
The scroll is papyrus.
Then it was murder.
The Nubian.
Wear this around your neck.
Why?
When we fight this creature, we must ask protection from the forces of old that it defied.
I'll give it to Helen. She's the one that needs protection.
No. Her life is not in danger. It is her soul.
Should love for you come to her, he will try to destroy you.
That amulet, the
Egyptians believe, was a charm against evil sendings such as struck down your father.
Your dog is frightened.
My servant will see to him.
Sit down, Miss Grosvenor.
Ancient Egypt.
Nothing modern.
What a strange incense.
Is it not familiar to you?
No.
Our forefathers used it.
Yours and mine.
You will not remember what I show you now, and yet I shall awaken memories of love and crime and death.
I knelt by the bed of death.
Thy father's last farewell.
I knew the Scroll of Thoth could bring thee back to life.
I dared the gods' anger and stole it.
I stole back to thy tomb to bring thee back to life.
I murmured the spell that raises the dead, but they broke in upon me and found me doing an unholy thing.
Thy father condemned me to the nameless death.
The scroll he ordered buried with me, that no such sacrilege might disgrace Egypt again.
A nameless grave.
The slaves were killed so that none should know.
The soldiers who killed them were also slain, so no friend could creep to the desert with funeral offerings for my condemned spirit.
Anck-es-en-Amon.
My love has lasted longer than the temples of our gods.
No man ever suffered as I did for you.
But the rest you may not know.
Not until you are about to pass through the great night of terror and triumph, until you are ready to face moments of horror for an eternity of love.
Until I send back your spirit that has wandered through so many forms and so many ages.
But before then, Bast must again send forth death.
Death to that boy for whom love is creeping into your heart.
Love that would keep you from myself.
Love that might bring sickness and even death to you.
Awake.
Have I been asleep?
I had strange dreams.
Dreams of Ancient Egypt, I think.
There was someone like you in them.
My pool is sometimes troubled.
One sees strange fantasies in the water, but they pass like dreams.
My dog! Wolfram!
Wolfram!
Where is he?
Helen.
Helen, where have you been?
We've been so worried.
We've hunted everywhere.
In the museum again?
Yes.
Muller's down in the Arab quarter now.
Well, if I must give an explanation, it was stuffy in here.
I can't be shut up all the time.
Besides, I don't like the feeling that I'm always being watched.
I took the dog with me.
Well, where is the dog?
He's... He's dead.
But how?
I don't know.
Where?
I don't remember.
But I can see it now, standing on poor Wolfram's back, a white cat.
A white cat?
The cat goddess, Bast.
Yes, there was a statue of Bast.
The goddess of evil sendings!
Just what happened?
Try to remember, Helen.
I don't want to remember.
Besides, I don't see that it's any affair of yours.
Oh, but it is. We know that you were with Ardeth Bay.
Oh, Helen.
Helen, I love you. I'm trying to help you and protect you.
We all are.
Don't let me go again.
I'll try to get away, but you mustn't let me, no matter what I do or what I say.
There's death there for me, and life for something else inside me that isn't me.
But it's alive, too, and fighting for life.
Save me from it, Frank.
Save me.
Oh, everything's going to be all right.
Now that you've asked for help,
I'll never leave you alone.
I'll get Mrs. Muller down here with you, and I'll stay here till the doctor comes.
And then, we'll take you to my house.
Oh, Helen, it's been such torture.
I love you so.
I don't like that doctor.
Please go in there and find out what he's saying about me.
I will, my dear.
He'll know just what's the matter with you, and cure you.
Now, don't worry.
Now, Miss Sparling, help me to get dressed and get out of here.
It's come over you again,
Miss Grosvenor.
I must escape. I'm being held here. You must help me.
But you told me when these fits came on, I wasn't to listen.
I have a friend. He's rich. He'll give you money.
Now you just lie down again.
You know you mustn't get up.
Well, if you don't want money, what do you want most?
He'll give you anything, if only you'll help me to go to him.
You want me to call Dr. Muller?
No. I hate him.
Mr. Whemple, then?
I'll die if I don't get away from him. Now, Miss Grosvenor...
It's killing me. Do you hear? Please, please!
Now, Helen, you must not do this again.
You're always so exhausted afterwards.
She's too weak to be removed, except to a hospital.
I insist on keeping her here under our direct observation.
But Dr. LeBarron, you haven't told us what to do for her.
She's getting weaker every day.
You know that negligee
I bought in Paris?
Help me to put it on, and bring me my toilet things.
I want some color.
I want to look well.
But you can't do that, my dear. They'd never allow it. The nurse would be...
I know.
We'll get rid of her.
This is a plot, just between us.
I want to look the way I did.
Just a surprise, for Frank.
And I want you to bring him to me. You understand?
In short, I have failed to make a diagnosis.
Medical science is helpless in a case like this.
Frank.
Go to her, and don't be angry with me.
I couldn't resist her.
Oh, but Helen, you shouldn't have done this.
They shouldn't have let you.
Just this once.
Perhaps the last time.
But you're going to get well.
Then I know I can make you love me.
I know I can make you happy.
I do love you, Frank.
And I'm trying to prove it, because I'd rather die than live and lose you.
But you're going to live. We're not going to lose each other.
So, my dear...
Don't scold me.
Just feminine vanity. I wanted to look my best again.
So you know more than
I realized you knew.
What do you mean?
These impulses to go to him.
The pull is too strong to withstand and live.
I'm so glad you understand.
Helen knows.
She knows the moment she stops struggling, he will give her back her strength to come to him.
But I don't want to lose my own mind and be someone else, someone I hate.
My dear, while you were growing worse, we tried to find him and failed.
The next time the call comes, go to him.
Muller, what can we do now?
We can do no more.
Ardeth has beaten me.
The next time he draws her to him, we must follow her.
And then?
We will destroy him.
I've given her some bromide.
She's asleep now. I'll go to bed.
All right. I'll wait here till Dr. Muller comes.
Good night.
Good night.
Where are we?
This is my bed, but this is not the temple nor my father's palace.
Do not look,
Anck-es-en-Amon.
Do not be afraid.
I was afraid.
When you were kneeling beside my bed, a veil came over my eyes. Darkness.
Your last memory is of me in the hour of your death as I knelt by your bed,
3,700 years ago.
No man has ever suffered for woman as you suffered for me.
And now that the gods have forgiven us...
No, no, not yet.
Your soul is in a mortal body, renewed many times since we loved in Thebes of old.
But that love is not for us again until the great change.
I do not understand.
Look.
Look and wonder.
Figure of myself.
It is my coffin, made by my father against my death.
What mummy has usurped my eternal resting place?
It is thy dead shell.
I tried then to raise this body. I could raise it now.
But it would be a mere thing that moved at my will, without a soul.
It was not only this body that I loved. It was thy soul.
I destroy this lifeless thing.
Thou shalt take its place but for a few moments, and then rise again, even as I have risen.
Come.
Imhotep, this is the place of embalmment.
It is not lawful for me, a priestess of
Isis, to see or touch an unclean thing.
Come to the altar of Anubis, the guide of the dead.
The time has come for the final prayers.
What have I to do with Anubis?
The ancient rites must be performed over thy body.
Then I will read the great spell with which Isis brought
Osiris back from the grave.
And thou shalt rise again.
No.
No, I'm alive!
I'm young! I won't die!
I loved you once, but now you belong with the dead.
I am Anck-es-en-Amon, but I... I'm somebody else, too.
I want to live, even in this strange new world.
For thy sake
I was buried alive.
I ask of thee only a moment of agony.
Only so can we be united.
The bath of natron.
You shall not plunge my body into that!
Let the deed be done.
Let me go!
Let me go!
Don't kill me! I'm a priestess of Isis!
Save me from that mummy!
It's dead! Save me!
I no longer fear you.
Do with me what you will.
Frank!
She's gone to him.
They must be in the museum.
Now I know his horrible plan.
He's going to kill her and make her a living mummy, like himself.
The gods will receive into the underworld the spirit of Anck-es-en-Amon.
But not for long.
Osiris will release thy soul.
You shall rest from life, like the setting sun in the West.
But you shall dawn anew in the East as the first rays of
Amon-Ra dispel the shadows.
Look! What's that?
Come on!
Frank! Frank!
Helen!
Helen!
Oh, Isis! Holy Maiden!
I was thy consecrated vestal.
I broke my vows. Save me now!
Teach me the ancient summons, the holy spells I've forgotten.
I call upon thee as of old!
Helen.
Call her. He has dragged her back to Ancient Egypt.
Call her! Her love for you may bridge the centuries.
Helen. Helen!
Come back.
It's Frank.
Come back.
Carl Denham.
Mrs. Hudson! Mrs. Hudson!
Get out! I'll have you arrested.
That's my business...
Pretending to be the gas man.
- I'm supposed to...
- The very idea.
All right, Mr. Denham. It's only me.
I am sorry, Mr. Denham. He said he was the gas man. Had a card and everything.
Listen, Mrs. Hudson, as long as I am rooming in your house... if your own father comes to the door, don't you believe a word he says.
It's a pity the people in New York don't try and catch a few gunmen... instead of hunting a nice gentleman like you.
Is Mrs. Hudson there?
Oh, ho. That's the lady in the front room.
- Oh.
- Coming.
I'm from the news.
Is that so? Well, I've got news for you:
You're going to get out of this room so fast...
- No, I'm not.
- Ladies, no riots, please.
If people don't stop getting into my house under false pretenses...
I just want a story.
If I go back without it, I'll lose my job.
- Don't bother to pull that old line.
- You're big news, you know.
What, after a whole month?
That's time enough for New York to forget the World War.
The War was a long way off, but King Kong, the giant ape...
- ...was right here on the spot.
- So I've heard.
And you're the man that brought him here.
Kong is dead. But everybody's interested in you, too, Mr. Denham.
All those people that Kong killed and injured... all the property owners who are suing you for damages, and...
And the theater owners, and the men who put money in advanced publicity, and...
Say, are you telling me?
Why don't you let him alone? He hasn't dared leave the house for a week.
That's what I want, the personal reaction story.
You want to know what the captor of the late Kong...
- ...thinks about, eh?
- Yes.
I thought I had him safe.
Don't you suppose I'm sorry for the harm he did?
I wish I'd left him on his island.
Old Kong, I'm sure paying for what I did to you.
Mrs. Hudson, suppose we look out and count the gentlemen in disguise... who are waiting for me?
If I don't get out of this house pretty soon, I'll choke.
Hey!
Aren't you going to give me a story?
All right, tell my public that Carl Denham, the bright boy... who was going to make a million dollars out of King Kong, is flat broke.
Everybody in New York is suing me for something.
The only place I haven't heard from is the Bide-A-Wee home.
But, Mr. Denham, my readers want to know...
There's a newsboy and a peddler and a taxi driver out there.
I'll bet you a nickel they're all process servers.
- There's a man coming up the steps.
- Huh?
Why, it's Charlie. Let him in.
- Hello, Charlie, what do you want?
- Captain Englehorn send you this.
- Where'd you come from?
- All time, stay on ship.
- Cook for Skipper. Easy job.
- Mm.
Tell the Skipper I'll be over at the ship as soon as I can get out of here.
- What's matter? You scared to come out now?
- You said it. Much obliged, Charlie.
- Maybe you can get out through the basement.
- Come on. Let's try it.
Rags.
Bottles, rags.
You've got a nerve.
I got everything, lady.
And I buy everything.
Rags, bones.
Say, you fresh guy!
Mrs. Hudson.
Mr. Carl Denham.
Well, I'll be. Hello, Mickey.
- Hello.
- Have a heart, will you?
That's 15 of those things you've slipped me.
- I'm the best in the business, Mr. Denham.
- Well, what is it this time?
Steiner and Wayne.
Destruction of property by Kong on 39th street.
Shock, mental anguish, and sprained ankle to owner of said property.
If I don't get out of this house,
I'll bite somebody.
Listen, Mickey, I've got a date.
You've done your job.
How about helping me out-smart those other guys?
Mr. Denham, I'll give you a ride on my junk wagon.
You... Ha, ha. You mean to say you've got a wagon to go with that makeup?
Mr. Denham, I'm an artist.
Hey.
How did you get in there?
You can go from the roof to chimney.
Anthony St. Nick and Santa Claus.
Ooh. Commence.
Rags.
Bottles. Bones.
Rags. Hey, you can take off the tin hat.
You're safe now.
Where are you going, Mr. Denham?
Drop me at the nearest subway station, James.
You know, it's funny how anybody's troubles are somebody's gain.
I've been working steady since you got in this jam.
You've no idea how that cheers me up.
The boy who was going to make a million dollars.
Rags!
So that's the mess I'm in, Skipper.
Kong sure was a hoodoo for me.
I guess next time you leave big monkey alone, huh?
Next time? Ha, ha.
Charlie must think Kongs are plentiful.
Well, Denham, now I'll tell you why I wanted to see you.
- I've got a plan for both of us-
- What is it?
Going to get a couple of megaphones and run sightseeing trips around the harbor?
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Mr. Denham, I...
Mickey.
- One more summons and I'll brain you.
- No, wait, Mr. Denham.
I ain't got no summons. Honest. I ain't.
I come to tip you off.
- Did you follow me over here?
- No, I live over here.
My father-in-law said he saw you come in by the gates.
I feel very friendly to you, Mr. Denham.
You've kept me working pretty steady lately.
Yeah, sure, I know, I've been a big help.
Now, what's on your mind?
I heard this afternoon you're going to be indicted.
- What?
- Indicted.
- The grand jury's going to indict you.
- Let me out of this. I'm going crazy.
You take my tip and get out.
Summons is one thing and grand jury is something else already.
- They are going to put you on the stand.
- Stop it! All right, Mickey, much obliged.
- Now beat it, will you?
- All right. Such a fine customer.
Oh, Denham?
- Denham, I...
- What good is the grand jury?
What can they find out?
I brought Kong back here, he got loose, did a lot of damage... got killed, and that's that.
- What can I do about it?
- We can go to jail for 10 years.
- What do you mean, "we"?
- I'm in it, too, up to my neck.
Now, see here. This ship's still mine.
There are no attachments on her yet.
- They just haven't got around to you.
- That's a good reason for hurrying.
In three hours, I can get together a skeleton crew, enough to handle her.
Yeah, and we'll go yachting.
We can make some sort of a living carrying freight.
Take the East Indies.
There are hundreds of little ports there that no sizable ship ever goes to.
- I know that part of the world.
- What'll we use for money?
Well, I... I've saved up a little.
Enough to get us started.
- Yes, but...
- Come on, Denham.
You know, Skipper... you're pretty swell to be willing to take me with you.
- Is it a go, then?
- What?
To be off on this old ship again, out of all this?
Say, you bet it's a go.
Well, this looks like a hustling community, Skipper.
Suppose we can get any business here?
Better get some soon, or we won't be able to pay the crew.
Say, uh, how far is it to Kong's island?
1,753 miles.
Well, you're pretty glib with that.
You must have been checking up.
Huh? Oh.
I just happened to come across our old chart last night... and I was curious.
Yeah, sure.
- Bosun.
- Yes, sir.
Get that number two hatch off and break out the cargo.
That won't take very long.
If we weren't so short-handed,
I'd get rid of that man.
He's a troublemaker.
Of course, Wong Ho would have to ship his copra last week.
Well, let's see.
There's a couple of half-caste traders here.
We might see them tomorrow...
- ...and get a bit of a cargo.
- Look, Skipper. There's a show in town.
- I'll bet it's terrible.
- Don't be a crab, Skipper. It's a show.
We ought to see it.
- I want a drink and some dinner.
- There's plenty of time for that.
You don't mean to say you're going to miss the sagacious seals?
Don't you want to laugh and thrill with La Belle Helene?
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.
Come, Bobby. Come, George.
Come, Fattima. In with you.
And now, La Belle Helene!
Sweet songstress who has appeared before all the crowned heads of Europe... will conclude the performance... with one of her most popular songs.
La Belle Helene!
Oh, I've got the runaway blues
I want to wander away
Oh, I've got the runaway blues today
Don't want to stay
I know that trains are going somewhere
And steamers are sailing the blue
They go, but baby, what do I care?
'Cause none of them's going to you
Poor kid.
- You know, she's got something.
- It certainly isn't the voice.
Voice, who cares? She's got personality.
Somebody'd show her what to do with it.
I hear the steamer whistle crying
Whoo, whoo
It's just an echo when I'm sighing
Whoo, whoo
You ran away and never told me
What for, what for
And now your arms will never hold me
No more, no more
I don't want the train on the track
Don't want the ship on the sea
Why? 'Cause they ain't bringing you back to me
Poor me
Thank you for your kind reception of our efforts.
And remember, another big show here tomorrow night.
Well, if that's your idea of a pleasant evening, I...
It's interesting, Skipper.
I'll bet you could take a kid like that... and put her over to the producer of a musical comedy.
- But not to the captain of a freighter.
- Ha, ha.
Father, is that man coming again tonight?
Yes, he is. Any objection?
Can't I have a friend drop in?
- He isn't a friend.
- Well, he's a white man...
- ...somebody to talk to.
- Somebody to drink with.
That's enough. Shut up now and go to bed.
You can't get away from here. No money.
How you think you can get away from here? Huh?
Your Dutchman will be here in a couple of days, won't he?
Dutch magistrate? Ha!
What do you think he'll do for you?
He don't care what happens to you and your rotten little show.
Not a rotten show.
I was ringmaster in the biggest circus.
Used to play Colombo, Singapore.
Sure, and you was rotten.
Who're you calling... Who are you?
- Rotten captain!
- You lay off me.
Rotten captain, lost ship.
Lost it on purpose, eh?
Tried to get the insurance...
- ...didn't you?
- Shut up.
Poor captain.
Lost ship, lost job.
Lost certificate.
Ah, dry up, you old tramp.
You're a tramp.
No certificate, no job.
You're no better than me.
And you just lay off my liquor, will you?
Give it back.
Father! Father!
Father!
Father, Father, tell me what happened.
Who did it?
Tony.
Tony, come down.
Tony.
Tony, please, come down.
Tony.
Tony.
- Tony.
- You'll never catch a monkey that way.
- Did you ever catch a monkey?
- Did I ever...? Ha, ha.
Lady, you'd be surprised.
They won't come back.
Oh, well, why should they?
Oh, uh...
I saw your show last night.
How'd the monkeys get away?
I had to let them out.
The tent burned.
Where's the man who owns the show?
He's my father.
He was hurt.
He's dead.
Well, what a tough break.
I'm sorry, kid.
My father used to be with World Wide.
- That's the biggest circus in the East.
- Yes, I know. What did you do?
I was in the ballet.
I wasn't very good.
What happened to World Wide?
Well, my father... Well, he sort of drank.
You know.
And...
They didn't want him anymore.
- So he started his own show.
- Yes.
Well, we just had a few monkeys.
It wasn't very good.
Say, that's no way to talk.
"I wasn't very good, the show wasn't very good."
Cut it out! You want to tell everybody how good you are.
Throw out your chest. Brag about yourself.
Oh.
So you're in the show business too.
No, I'm in the shipping business.
- I just put in with the cargo.
- Oh.
I thought maybe you had a show, and I could...
No, I'm sorry.
Well, I've got a date.
Are you going to be all right?
I mean, have you got any money?
Yes.
Well, keep your chin up.
I'll be seeing you.
Miss, I heard about your father.
- If I could do anything...
- You've done enough.
You killed my father.
Killed? Why, what...?
The tent caught fire.
My father was beaten over the head.
He wasn't burned.
What do you think the magistrate will say to that when he gets here?
You can't accuse me.
- You wasn't there.
- How do you know I wasn't?
Unless you were.
How do you know what my father said to me before he...?
Before he died?
He... What did he say?
The magistrate will be here in a few days.
I'll tell him.
You better be careful.
What are you going to tell the magistrate?
You can just wonder about that till he gets here.
- There isn't a pound of cargo for us here.
- What'll we do now?
Might pick up some business in the Banda group.
It's a dull life, Skipper.
We need excitement.
Carl Denham.
Don't you remember me?
- Nils Helstrom.
- Well, for the love of Mike. Helstrom.
Sure, I remember you.
This is Captain Englehorn.
Captain Helstrom. Sit down.
Say, do you know who this is?
The man who gave me the map of Kong's island.
And he wants to know if I remember him. Ha-ha-ha!
Have a drink.
So, that was your ship came in last night?
Mine and Denham's.
I heard about you in Singapore.
How you'd captured the biggest animal on earth and taken him back to New York.
Agh.
I'm down, Denham.
- Don't you think you owe me something?
- Ha, ha.
Well, sir, you certainly came to the right man.
- How about a 50-50 split?
- You mean that?
Sure, I mean it. I'll give you half of everything I made out of King Kong.
- How much would that come to?
- Well, let's see, 10... no, 11 lawsuits and the privilege of being indicted by the grand jury too.
- Ah. Then you're broke too?
- Broke? I'm shattered.
Well, then how about giving me passage on your ship?
- I want to get away from here.
- Where's your own ship?
I lost her on the Banka reefs.
- Tough luck. No job since?
- Everyone is down on me.
It wasn't my fault.
You know what those waters are like.
Will you take me to some port that isn't Dutch?
- What's the matter with the Dutch?
- I tell you, they're down on me.
I want to make a fresh start.
You realize how far we'd have to go to land you out of Dutch, uh... jurisdiction?
We can't run all over the Indian Ocean carrying one passenger.
Sorry, old man. Have another drink.
But, Denham, when you got Kong off that island... didn't you get the treasure?
- What?
- Didn't you find the treasure?
Find it?
Why, I never even heard of it.
- Say, are you kidding me?
- Why should I?
To tell the truth, I had an idea
I'd go and look for it myself someday.
You held out on me, eh?
How much do you know about this treasure?
Well, not a lot.
Dying native I picked up at sea...
You drew the map from his description, and he told you about the great wall.
Yeah, he talked about the treasure of the island.
Who put it there?
Why, the people who built the wall.
Yes, that might be.
Skipper, do you remember I said there wasn't a reason... on Earth for going back?
Look. The answer to a prayer.
We're off again.
Hello. I heard you were stopping here.
Felt a little worried about you.
Thought I'd better see you before I go.
- Are you going?
- Yes. Off tonight in a big rush.
- On your ship?
- Yeah, sure.
There isn't any other way to get out of this place, is there?
Oh, uh, here, you take this.
- Can't I go too?
- What?
- Let me go on your ship.
- Nix, kid, nix.
We're going on a long voyage.
We won't be putting in at any port where we could leave you.
Don't leave me. Please, take me with you.
I won't be any trouble.
I'll just sit on the ship.
I won't talk or anything.
Listen, kid, I can't. Honest.
Now, you take this money and buy yourself a passage on the next ship... that's going where you want to go.
- Go on, take it.
- Let me go with you.
Please. Please.
No, no, no, nothing doing.
Now, you take it. Sorry it isn't more, but that's the best I can do.
There'll be a schooner or something along pretty soon.
I can't take you, kid. You'll be okay.
You just make a plan and stick to it.
- All right.
- That's a good girl.
It's a pretty tough life, isn't it?
Well...
Good luck.
- Weather's made-to-order, Skipper.
- I hope it holds.
The next land we sight will be Kong's island.
Yeah.
That fellow Helstrom is getting too chummy with the crew.
- I don't like it.
- Why don't you call him down for it?
What's your opinion of Helstrom?
Well, he got in some trouble over losing his ship, I guess.
That's pretty plain.
He certainly was anxious to leave Dakang.
And he isn't at all anxious to get to Kong's island.
Have you noticed him when we talked about the time we were there?
- Think he's scared?
- Scared green.
Green now and yellow later on, eh?
- Does he expect us to go ashore?
- Why, sure.
He's got to have a bodyguard, hasn't he?
Say... do you know there was a dozen sailors killed on the last voyage he made here?
- Killed? By them animals?
- Yeah.
But, you see, Denham and the skipper came out all right.
But you don't have to worry.
There's plenty of rifles aboard.
If I was captain, I certainly wouldn't take my crew into danger.
- Hey!
- What?
Wha...?
Hey, Bill.
Where?
Hey, Connelly.
If you want me to, I'll give Helstrom a tip that he's too thick with the crew.
Go ahead. Bad for discipline.
We must be in Russia. Here comes the Committee of the Workers.
- Captain Englehorn.
- Well?
- Captain, I went down in forward hold.
- Well, what of it?
- Captain, I found something.
- What's the matter? Found what?
Holy mackerel.
- I just didn't have anywhere to go.
- All right, go back to your work.
This young lady a friend of yours,
Mr. Denham?
No. Well... yes. I met her, that is,
I talked with her in Dakang.
Look here, this isn't my fault.
I told her she couldn't come.
Well...
We can't take her back. Mr. Helstrom.
You ought to be beaten to a pulp.
You called me?
Yes, we have a passenger, and she...
You. How did you get here?
This is our partner.
I know him.
You do?
Yes, of course, you couldn't help seeing each other in Dakang, could you?
Well, here we are.
Just one big, happy family.
You take the words right out of my mouth.
You keep your mouth shut.
You promise me to keep quiet.
I won't promise.
You crazy brat. Denham's sore at you anyway for being here.
You try to make trouble between us, and he'll be off you for life.
Skipper's looking for you.
Say, I don't know what's the matter with you and Helstrom... but we're all cooped up together on this ship.
I didn't ask you to come.
You're here on your own hook.
No matter who you like or dislike... you've got to behave and be pleasant.
Understand?
Are you mad at me?
Not very.
It's, uh... This is nice, isn't it?
It's all right.
Mr. Denham.
- Mr. Denham.
- Yeah?
Skipper says get dressed and come on deck.
Okay. What is it?
Have we sighted the island?
Yes, sir, about two miles off.
- Say, it's a thrill coming back here.
- Yes, sir.
You had a pretty bad time when you were here before, didn't you?
Yeah, it's a pretty tough spot.
The natives will be glad to see us.
We did them a good turn once, and I...
What the...?
I'm warning you all.
You're crazy to do a thing like this.
We're not crazy enough to go to that island.
- What is it, Skipper? Is this on the level?
- It's real enough.
- Where's Helstrom? They get him too?
- All right.
Over that side to the lifeboat.
All of you.
So this is why you've been spending so much time in the foxhole.
- What do you think you're doing?
- We know what we're doing.
Come on, get over the side.
You can row yourselves to your blasted island and stay there.
Yes, and if those animals kill anybody, it won't be us.
Yes. Get going.
Because you pay us your dirty money, you think you own us.
You sweat and drive us, but you don't give us a living wage for our blood and sweat.
- When did you do all this sweating?
- You think you own us, body and soul.
- Oh, listen to reason.
- We've listened enough.
We've got the ship and we're going to keep it.
- Over the side.
- You're not going to shove this kid off too.
She followed you aboard the ship, she can follow you off.
Do you think I want to stay? I know.
Here's your chance to get rid of me.
- He killed my father.
- What?
He was a drunken old tramp.
I didn't kill him.
I know you did.
He said you'd be angry if I tried to make trouble.
Well, what a fine partner you've turned out to be.
Aw, pipe down. Get going.
Of course, you know what this will mean when you get caught.
Listen, I'll call the whole thing off now.
We'll turn back.
Sure, and be arrested for mutiny as soon as we reach port.
I'll give you my word I won't report you.
It's too late for that kind of talk.
We'll stick by what we've done.
Over the side and see how you like it.
I'll be seeing you again, I hope.
What do you think the chances are?
- Charlie, they throw you off too?
- No throw off. Get off.
Me no like them men.
- Cast off.
- Wait.
Aren't you going to give us any guns?
We've given you food and water.
You're lucky to get that.
A smart man like you don't need a gun.
Good boy, Charlie.
You cook now, you die pretty soon.
Row, you blasted bourgeois.
You got a nice day for it.
Now, then, go to your places.
Stokers below.
Bosun.
- Get that ladder up.
- What was that?
I said, get the ladder up.
Oh! And I promote you.
- You'll be mate now.
- That's fine. Who's gonna be captain?
I'm taking command, of course.
Clear the decks. Get back to work.
Do you think that we got rid of a good captain... so we could have a bad one?
We're through with captains on this ship.
He wants to be boss.
Let him go with the rest of the bosses.
Yo-ho!
Ha!
That's where all captains belong, over the side.
Bon voygee, Captain Helstrom.
Something tells me we've got a passenger.
Well...
How nice to see you again, under the circumstances.
Skipper, have we got to save him?
Hey, Skipper, when the natives see us,
I bet they'll throw a party.
Well, maybe not a party.
It's the chief.
Hey, did you throw that, you rat?
He says yes, he did, because his village is destroyed... and his people are killed, and it's all our fault for leading Kong inside the wall.
Well, tell him not to attack us.
Tell him we overcame Kong... and we're still big mates.
Come on, Charlie, shove off.
We've got to find another place to land.
What's the good of this?
There's no way out.
Well, it's the only place we've seen where we could get a foot ashore.
Maybe we can climb up someplace.
You stick with me, kid.
A fly couldn't climb out of here.
Yeah, here's a way out.
Wait till I take a look.
- Uh, captain, I...
- Huh?
- About that mutiny, I...
- The less said, the better, Helstrom.
We're all in a tight place together, and I don't think you'll let us down.
No, no, of course not.
Of course not.
- I didn't know that you came.
- You said stick to you.
Do you obey orders?
Why doesn't Denham come back?
We'd better go look for him.
A smart man like you don't need a gun.
Ha!
Look!
Well, if it isn't the little Kong.
He's stuck in the quicksand.
He can't get out.
I never knew that old Kong had a son.
Don't you think we ought to help him?
Well, how?
If we could get logs and things to him, maybe he could get out.
- Aren't you afraid of him?
- Yes, sort of.
Well...
It sounds kind of silly, but I'm sorry for him.
So am I. But I've got a reason.
Animals always know when you're trying to help them.
I don't believe he'd hurt us if he got out.
I suppose we're both crazy, but let's try.
Look out, Skipper, that's quicksand.
Skipper, there's a...
Skipper, believe it or not, there's a little Kong.
What? A little...
- How little?
- Well, just a little one.
- About 12 feet high.
- Good...
Well, what happened? What did you do?
I know it sounds funny, but instead of shooting him, I helped him out of a jam.
I felt...
Well...
I felt I owed his family something.
You really feel conscience-stricken about King Kong, don't you?
Whatever you do, don't mention Little Kong to Helstrom.
- He'd have a nervous breakdown.
- I'd like to break his neck.
We ought to go hunting and save our rations for emergencies.
This is cut right into the side of Skull Mountain.
My guess, that temple.
- Maybe big devil live in there.
- A temple?
Helstrom, suppose the treasure should be hidden here.
That certainly would be wonderful.
- You'd better come along with me, Helstrom.
- We'll meet here at sundown.
My go with Skipper.
Unh!
I'd forgotten you.
You'd better wait right here.
We'll all be back soon.
Do you think I'm going to stay here alone?
Well, all right, then, come on with me.
But be quiet.
And don't talk.
I thought tropical jungles were full of fruit.
That's what everybody thinks who's never been...
Look.
Well, we won't starve, anyway.
Good boy, Little Kong.
Say, can he scrap, just like his old man.
- Look, he's hurt.
- Huh?
Poor Little Kong.
Do you suppose he knew he was helping us?
Of course not.
You want me to believe he was grateful?
Well, he did save us, didn't he?
And how do we know what animals think?
Let's go and help him.
Are you game?
Yes, if you are.
Wait.
If you talk, very calmly... sometimes that keeps animals quiet.
- You frightened him.
- Yeah, that's too bad.
Was I too rough with him?
Poor old boy.
Baby Kong.
Yeah, some baby.
You're not a patch on your old man.
I must be completely cuckoo to be doing this.
Giving you a ﬁrst-aid treatment instead of running like blazes.
Guess it must be remorse or something.
You see...
I'm the guy that knocked out your pop with a gas bomb and then... carried him off to New York in chains.
I've been sorry for it ever since.
Yeah, you see, the poor old geezer got shot at the finish.
I guess if I'd left him alone... we'd all have been better off.
This is sort of an apology.
There you are, boy.
Two good deeds in one day for something that size... we ought to be caught up on our good deeds for a year.
I wish I had one of those coconuts.
I'll see what I can do about it.
Hey, look what you're doing, you big dummy.
I wish you'd be a little more careful of what you wish for.
Hey.
You better lie down and do your sleeping.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to go to sleep.
I was helping you keep watch.
I have to keep watch of you.
That's the third time I've caught you.
Aren't you going to signal the others again?
Well, there's no use wasting any more ammunition.
They'd have answered those shots
I ﬁred if they'd heard them.
You better lie down.
Here.
Take my coat for a pillow.
- You'll need it.
- No, I won't. I'll keep the fire going.
There you are.
You're a grand little scout.
I'm sorry I got you into all this mess, kid.
You didn't.
I came.
Well, then I'm glad they wouldn't let you stay on the ship.
But I'm just another trouble.
You told me not to come on the boat.
- Good night, kid.
- Good night.
It's gone.
What fashion animal you call that, huh? I no like.
Here's your gun.
Well, that leaves only one shotgun among us.
It's light enough now.
We better go and look for Denham and the girl.
Mm. Heh.
- Well.
- Good morning.
Good morning.
- No sign of the Skipper?
- No.
I'll fire one more shot.
Our guardian angel.
Hey, look.
I'm going to try and get into this place.
If you have no objections.
You're sure you don't mind?
Well, that's fine.
Listen, you attend to your business and I'll attend to mine.
Look! The treasure!
The treasure of the island!
I was expecting you.
Come on, baby.
We've found it!
Please, Little Kong, help us.
Hand it down.
Attaboy, Kong.
Stick to me, kid, and you'll wear diamonds.
Look at them.
Just look at them. We're rich.
We're all rich.
Well, what are you going to do with them?
Huh?
Yeah, I guess maybe a sailboat would be more useful.
Hey, put that down.
Hey, look out!
You'll shoot yourself, you half-wit.
Hey!
Hey, look out! You want to kill somebody?
Sure, you've fixed everything now.
You big rummy.
Do you think he's dead?
Denham.
That's the Skipper.
- What's happened? Where's your gun?
- It's broken, Skipper, but listen...
What? Both guns gone? We can't stay here. Let's go back to the boat.
Helstrom, the treasure, I...
You fool, there never was any treasure.
Let's go, let's get out of here.
Then that was just a yarn you were giving me.
Of course. I had to tell you that to get away from Dakang.
Then there isn't any treasure at all?
Helstrom. Helstrom.
- He's going to the boat.
- Why, that crazy fool may take it.
Let's go after him.
I'm going back for the rest of the treasure.
Make sure of the boat.
I'll catch up with you. Hurry!
Earthquake!
My poor kid.
It doesn't seem to matter very much.
Stick to me and you'll wear diamonds.
Look.
Look.
Ship.
Ship.
Hello, kid.
What are you thinking about?
Poor Little Kong.
Do you suppose he knew he was saving my life?
Well, I'm sure he did.
Pretty soon, when we get back... you'll be saying goodbye to me, won't you?
Yeah.
What?
Where are you going?
I don't know.
Well, you'll have plenty of money, kid.
We'll split the treasure four ways.
Couldn't you just split it... three ways?
How do you mean?
Well... one-third to the Skipper, one-third to Charlie... and one-third... to us.
Well, you said stick to you.
This is nice, isn't it?
It's all right.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[CLOCK CHIMES]
[DOG BARKING AND HOWLING]
[WOMAN SCREAMING]
But how else can we explain these terrible deaths?
Von Ilse last night.
Five others before him.
That's six within as many weeks, Inspector.
Our friends, neighbors that we've known for years, drained
Of their life's blood, found dead
In bed, likely skeletons of skin and bone.
Vampires are at large,
I tell you, vampires!
Yeah, malignant demons who issue forth from their graves
In the dead of night to attack their victims
And drink the blood from their veins.
Brr!
God in heaven,
Brettschneider, don't jest!
Ah, that blood-sucking legend belongs in the same category
With werewolves and all other peasant superstitions.
But the bats, man!
The bats!
God, yes!
Big ones, so!
Oh, now we're switching to bats again.
There was an epidemic of giant bats in Klineschloss in 1643.
And at the same time, there was an outbreak of vampirism.
Rot!
Why, this record from the town archives proves it.
Says it, not proves it.
Well, I'll show you.
I'll show you.
Now, ah, here it is.
"And on this day was von Hausmen hanged"
From a gibbet in the public square
After being convicted on a proven charge of vampirism.
And on this same day, there did occur the departure
Of the bats, thousands of horrible flying creatures
Which infested the town for weeks.
And on the night of this same day,
February 13 in the year of our
Lord, 1643, was there a stake
Driven through von
Hausmen's heart
"And his head cut off with a gravedigger's shovel."
There.
Well, all the records in the world
Can't make me believe in vampires.
There are bloodsucking bats, yes,
In South America, thousands of miles from here.
But not in Klineschloss.
But bats fly!
They could fly here!
You saw the buggers, all of them.
Two wounds on the neck, right at the jugular vein.
Two wounds on the neck, pierced and spread apart
Just as if two fang-like teeth had
Bitten through the flesh and right into the veins.
And in every case, a blood clot, eight inches from the victim's
Neck, the mark of the feast, the devil's signature.
Does that appear the mark of a human being or a demon's?
God save us, the devil's.
You ought to make a pretty fair meal for a vampire.
But let's be consistent.
Are these human vampires or... or bats?
Vampires can take the shape of a human or a bat,
Just as they choose.
Oh.
They're magicians.
Well, it doesn't make sense to me.
The whole village is in terror.
We live in closed houses, behind locked doors and bolted
Shutters, not daring to close our eyes,
Fearful lest this unseen, silent death may find us in our sleep.
For it is then that it strikes, swiftly, silently, ghastly.
My room is tightly closed.
The windows are barred, nailed down!
Nothing can get in, nothing!
But they tell me vampires can go through stone walls,
Like that.
God save me, so they can!
We've got to do something, I tell you!
Klineschloss will become a deserted village.
Well, you might capture all the bats
And drown them in the river.
Karl!
Karl!
While you're hunting for vampires and chasing bats,
I'm looking for a human being, a murderer, a thief!
Well then, don't jest about it.
Do something!
I'm trying to!
Every hour, every day, every night since this thing started!
[DOG BARKING AND HOWLING]
Do you hear it?
Yes!
Yes!
Night after night, lying awake until dawn, waiting!
For what?
I don't know.
That's what I thought.
Good night, gentlemen.
Don't let the vampires get you.
[POP]
[LAUGHS]
Are your kisses dynamite!
Don't you like my kisses?
Well, how's my mastermind this evening.
Well, if you want the truth, not so good.
The Burgermeister and his grand council
Still stick to the vampire theory, huh?
Stick to it?
Ha!
They're quoting history to prove it.
I think you and Dr. von
Niemang are the only
Sane people left in the village.
And you?
What about you?
Hmm, me.
Well, I'm beginning to think I'm seven
Different kinds of a fool.
Murders are being done under my very nose.
I must be as blind as the bats themselves.
I can't find a single clue.
Oh, but you will,
Karl, you will.
Well, I haven't.
AUNT GUSSIE: Oh, Ruth!
And here comes dear Aunt Gussie to spread good cheer and hope.
Just what I thought, slaving your life away
In this awful place.
It hasn't got that nice, plain, wholesome smell of a hospital.
How are you, Karl?
Oh, quite well, thank you.
Well, I'm not.
This clammy old place is bound to give me pericarditis,
[INAUDIBLE], neuritis,
[INAUDIBLE]...
Well anyway, Ruth.
You want some coffee?
No, no thank you,
Frau Schappmann.
Well, just as well.
There's only two cups.
Here, dear.
Anything to chill out your bones.
Thank you.
Speaking of chills,
Frau Schappmann,
Did you know the villagers are supposed
To be infested with ghouls and vampires?
Oh, Karl!
Vampires!
Pariahs among fiends, demoniacal creatures
With huge canine teeth who bite deeply
Into the necks of their victims, to quaff
And gorge on blood, warm human blood!
There's no such thing as a vampire, Karl Brettschneider.
I don't believe in it.
You're just saying that to frighten me.
And I just won't be frightened.
I'm entirely too sensible to believe in such rubbish.
I beg pardon.
[GASPS] Oh, that was you.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
Who said you frightened me?
I'm not afraid of anything.
Could you tell me where
Dr. von Niemann is?
Well, he drove to the village to see
Martha, the old apple woman.
Thank you.
Is this what Dr.
Hobb prescribed?
Yes, sir.
She takes it in water.
Hmm.
Well, continue giving it to her.
Yes, sir.
It's stifiling in here.
Open these windows.
Herman open windows.
Me do, me do.
[SIGH] Well, she'll sleep well now, poor soul.
It won't be necessary for you to stay here.
A good night's sleep will work wonders for her.
It was kind of you to come, Doctor.
Oh, Martha has sold me apples for many years,
Always the good, ripe, juicy ones.
Martha give me apples!
I like!
[LAUGHS]
Shh!
Oh, to think.
[MOANS]
DR. VON NIEMANN:
She wants her cross.
Herman get.
Herman get.
Here.
Here.
Now that for Martha.
There.
Oh!
She won't let it out of her sight.
A terrible experience.
To be attacked by a giant bat is enough to shatter
Anyone's nerves.
She talks about it all the time, how it flew in her face
And tried to sink its teeth in her throat.
No, no, no, no.
Bats no do!
They soft, like cat.
They not bite Herman!
[CRIES OUT]
[INAUDIBLE] see what you've done?
There, there.
There, Martha, there.
Shh.
[CRYING SLOWS]
She'll be all right.
If she isn't, let me know.
Thank you for coming, Doctor.
That's all right.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Run along, Herman.
You can see Martha tomorrow.
Oh.
Ah, Dr. von Niemann.
Ah, Kringen, how are you?
Much better, thank you kindly sir,
Since you prescribed for me.
That's right.
Go to bed, Herman.
Go to bed!
You shouldn't be filing around the streets.
It's dangerous!
Oh.
I'm afraid.
Afraid?
Afraid of what, Kringen?
The bats, sir.
Big giant bats, with wings like an eagle.
DR. VON NIEMANN: You saw this bat, you say?
I saw it swooping down the street.
It came directly for my throat, sir.
When was this, Kringen?
Last night when they came to take von Ilse.
It was a big, monstrous thing.
I saw it leap across the alley and into a window.
I ran just as fast as my legs could carry me.
You said nothing about this?
There's enough fear in the village already.
Maybe I should.
Maybe I sh... I will.
I'll tell the Burgermeister.
Yes, Kringen.
That's the thing to do.
No!
Bats... bats good!
They not hurt Herman.
He plays with them.
You... you no tell!
No.
No, no, no, go to bed, Herman.
Go on.
Go on, go to bed!
You say he plays with bats?
His garret is filled with them.
He makes pets of them.
That's odd.
Very odd.
Maybe... maybe he's it.
Herman prowls around the streets all hours of the night,
Just like an animal.
Maybe he's the vampire.
Now, don't start any gossip with that, Kringen.
Heaven only knows where it might end.
Goodnight.
Goodnight, sir.
There.
Now.
So nice.
There.
See?
What did I tell you?
Perhaps there's something in what Kringen says.
Seems strange that a human being
Should want to play with bats.
[GROWLS]
[LAUGHS]
He isn't human, I tell you!
He's in league with the devil!
Put it on.
Put it on.
There.
Now, go to sleep.
You'll be all right in a few days.
The doctor says so.
Close the window.
Close the window!
I'm afraid!
The vampire!
He said leave them open.
But I'd have them closed.
Do you want the light?
Leave the light.
I'm afraid.
Well, I can't blame you for that, either.
I'll turn it down a little.
Goodnight.
If you want me, just pound on the floor.
I'll hear you.
All right.
Goodnight.
Goodnight, Martha.
Ohh.
Herr Brettschneider is here to see you, sir.
He's in the laboratory with Miss Bertin.
Oh, thank you.
Ah, here you are!
Good evening, Doctor.
Good evening, Ruth.
How are you, Karl?
Well, I'd feel a lot better if I could
Find the solution to these murders.
You don't believe in this vampire theory, then?
[SCOFFS] Of course not.
Do you?
There are many strange happenings, my boy,
Many mysteries beyond the power of the human mind
To comprehend.
Have you a theory which might explain these deaths?
Well, I'll be pleased to discuss it with you, but,
Uh, not now, now now.
I have some very important work to do.
Well, tomorrow then.
Tomorrow?
Yes, perhaps.
Uh, we'll see.
Oh, this isn't so important, Miss Bertin,
That you can't let it go till tomorrow.
All right, thank you, Doctor.
Oh, uh, how about Martha?
Huh?
Oh, nothing serious.
Just a case of nerves, after all.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Goodnight, Doctor.
Goodnight, Karl.
[FOOTSTEPS WALKING AWAY]
[CLOCK CHIMING]
[SCREAMS]
HOBB: Name?
SAUER: Martha Mueller.
HOBB: Age?
I don't know.
Cause of death?
Like all the rest.
A vampire.
Yes, yes, that's right.
When I said I was going to tell you,
His eyes burned up like coals of fire.
His hand reached out toward me, as
If he were gonna sink it into my throat.
And weigh this well.
He never works and never bathes, and yet he
Appears well fed always.
That's so.
He does.
Well, what does he live on, then?
I'll wager it's as Kringen says.
And my [INAUDIBLE] was in Martha's room
Tonight, when Herman put a flower in her hand.
Strange business if you ask me, mighty strange.
I hate it when [INAUDIBLE].
Yes.
After what's happened tonight
I've locked myself in my room
And prayed God to protect me from the devil!
[CROWD CHATTERING]
MAN IN CROWD: Dr. von Niemann!
[CROWD CHATTERING]
Dr. von Niemann!
[SCREAMS]
Well, what do you make of it, Doctor?
Are these two wounds similar to those
Found in the other bodies?
Dr. Hobb can answer that for you, sir.
Yes, they were the same in every case.
This is a strange condition, Karl.
So strange that I doubt the evidence of my eyes.
What was your conclusion, Hobb?
I diagnosed the wounds as having been made by needle
Sharp teeth, punctures [INAUDIBLE]
Penetrating into but not beyond the jugular veins.
Do you mean to say that you also
Believe they could have been made by teeth?
Frankly, I do.
Ha, you see, Brettschneider?
What kind of teeth, Doctor?
An animal of some sort.
It's hard to say.
The fangs of a wolf, perhaps.
A werewolf.
Could they have been made by, well, a bat, for instance?
DR. VON NIEMANN: A certain species, yes.
There are vampire bats.
Dr. William Garrison,
[INAUDIBLE] the perimeters
Of the upper Amazon, states that bloodsucking bats do exist.
He further asserted that the victims often
Become blood drinkers themselves,
Citing a case in which he saw a native [INAUDIBLE]
By his tribe brothers.
They swore he had become a human bat.
And, states Garrison, he confessed it.
KARL: Do you mean to say that such a thing as a human vampire
Is possible?
Who can say.
Historic records would have us believe that an evil soul,
Assuming there is such, can take any shape it pleases.
So why not [INAUDIBLE] that of a human being.
Eh, Karl?
Why not?
Have you any literature on the topic, Doctor?
Yes, I have many interesting volumes on my shelf
That might prove very enlightening.
I'll be glad to show them to you.
I don't mind admitting that I'm up a tree.
Stumped.
Well, we'll see what can be done, my boy.
No, no, no, Herman.
This is no place for you.
Go in, my boy.
Go in.
DR. VON NIEMANN:
Goodnight, John.
JOHN: Goodnight, Doctor.
DR. VON NIEMANN:
Goodnight, Hobb.
Uh, goodnight, Doctor.
DR. VON NIEMANN: In the morning, Karl.
KARL: Thank you, Doctor.
I'm sorry to have dragged you out at such an ungodly hour.
DR. VON NIEMANN: Oh, that's all right, that's all right.
Ah!
Ahh!
A child, fleeing in horror from the sight of death.
That was the vampire.
Arrest him!
Lock him up!
Kill him!
Has the entire village gone mad?
Herman wouldn't harm a baby, and you know it!
I've walk the streets of this village for over 40 years,
But tonight's the end.
He knows that I've told he plays with bats.
He knows that I saw him sneak into Martha's
House just before midnight.
Perhaps he was taking her another flower, Kringen.
The boy brought her one this evening while I was there.
He killed her just like he did all the rest!
And now he's gonna kill me.
Unless he's killed and a stake driven through his heart,
I'm a doomed man!
He'll kill me!
He'll kill me!
I'm doomed!
He'll kill me!
He'll kill me!
I'm a doomed man!
He'll kill me!
Good morning, Mr.
Brettschneider.
What brings you to
Klineschloss so early?
You.
Fibber.
I heard the doctor tell
Georgiana he expected you.
I knew there was something else.
You're a delightful prevaricator,
Karl, but not a very convincing one.
Oh, you don't mind me using your stethoscope,
Do you, Doctor?
Not at all, Frau Schnappman.
What seems to be the ailment this morning?
What's that?
Oh!
What seems to be the ailment this morning?
Well, Doctor, I am positive that I
Have valvular disease of the aorta.
Or maybe it's the, um, the right ventricle.
Hm.
Well, there's something wrong with my heart.
I can hear it beat thump, thump, thump,
Thump, just like the book says.
Well, if you didn't hear it beating thump, thump, thump,
Just as the book says, I would say there is something wrong.
What?
Without a moon?
You have a heart of stone.
All right then, close your eyes.
Now.
Oh, so young lady!
It's too early in the morning, Karl, much too early.
Oh, is it?
[GASPS] Oh, there's Aunt Gussie.
Hmm, she would show up just at a time like this.
Oh, oh!
[SIGHING]
Well, Aunt Gussie, what's the matter now?
An [INAUDIBLE] of the auricular, ventricular
Microvalves, to the [INAUDIBLE].
You mean your heart's beating.
Of course it's beating.
Dr. von Niemann tried to assure me.
But I know, I know it's serious.
I'm liable to go just like that.
Did he prescribe for you, dear?
Yes.
[INAUDIBLE] chloric acid.
You mean salicylic acid, don't you?
Well, silasalic or salicylic, it [INAUDIBLE].
My heart is much quieter.
Hello, Karl.
Hello.
Oh, Karl.
You will be good to Ruth when I'm gone, won't you?
Yes, of course I will, Frau Schnappman.
Well, I'm not gone yet.
And you can't marry her unless I say so.
Don't forget that.
Oh, my heart!
There, Auntie, you'll be all right.
Just rest a while.
What you need is...
Rest?
Rest, dear, and quiet.
[GROANS]
Aunt Gussie has a heart like a steam engine.
Karl! [LAUGHS]
[MEOWING]
Here, kitty, kitty.
Kitty, kitty!
Kitty-poo!
Come on!
Come on, kitty-poo.
Where are you, baby?
Come on!
Come on, kitty, kitty, kitty poo.
Come on... [GASPS] Ew!
[INAUDIBLE]
Nasty little beast!
Oh!
Don't you know it's wrong to steal?
[GASPS]
You'll cut yourself.
[INAUDIBLE] blood.
Ew!
Stop it, stop it!
No hurt me.
No hurt!
Oh, you poor thing.
Now, you wait right here, and I'll run in the house
And get something for that finger.
A subcutaneous wound like that might easily
Result in a tetanus infection.
Tetan... tetan...
Tetanus Lockjaw.
Not that you need be afraid!
From the way you talk I think you've got it already.
Look, here's a nice juicy apple for you.
Mm!
[SIGHS]
Ah, this is it.
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] by
Augusta Dom Calimay in 1746.
Huh.
"Let us suppose that these corpses do not actually"
Stir from their tombs, that only the ghosts
Or spirits appear to the living.
Wherefore do these phantoms present themselves
And what is it that energizes them?
Is it actually the soul of a dead man which has not
Yet departed to its final destination?
Or"...
AUNT GUSSIE: [INAUDIBLE] Now, how could a corpse buried
Under four or five feet of earth get
Out to do any such foolishness?
I don't believe it.
It's a fair question, Doctor.
How could it?
Well, according to accepted theory,
The vampire dematerializes the body
And reintegrates it outside the grave.
A good explanation if you can believe it.
And while I'm standing here listening to all this rubbish,
There's a poor man in the garden in danger
Of a tetanus infection.
Now, what should I do for him, Doctor?
Shall I apply [INAUDIBLE] or a tube saturation of [INAUDIBLE]?
Well, either will do.
Get some gauze and some material from...
Thank you, Doctor.
I'll wait here.
Difficult to believe, isn't it?
It's impossible to believe.
And yet it would explain these deaths, wouldn't it?
Ah, Brettschneider.
Pardon our intrusion,
Dr. von Niemann.
But after what you saw last night,
You'll be interested in this as well.
What's happened?
Kringen was found dead an hour ago, with the two punctures
In his neck and not a drop of blood in his body.
And what's more, Herman
Gleib has disappeared.
What?
Now are you convinced that we were right and you were wrong?
This ought to be proof enough for anybody.
Kringen said Herman would get him and he did.
Well, Brettschneider?
I appoint you my deputy.
Organize a searching party and comb this countryside
From one end to the other.
Find Herman Gleib and bring him in, but don't harm him.
You understand?
What good will that do?
He's a vampire.
There's only one thing for us to do when we find him,
Kill him and drive a stake through his heart.
Herman Gleib will be tried by a court of law!
If the charge against him is proven true,
The law will decide what to do with him, not you.
Now get your men together and do as I tell you.
That's a way to talk.
I'm going into town for a little while, Doctor.
Would you care to come along?
Oh, I hardly believe so.
There's little to be done till they find the boy.
If you need me then, I...
All right, thanks.
I'll let you know.
I feel as though
I'm going to faint.
There, Auntie, there's nothing here to be afraid of.
[INAUDIBLE]
Run along now and take care of that patient of yours.
Oh, heavens.
I forgot all about him.
Oh, my heart!
Oh!
Poor Auntie.
She's has every ailment in the book.
Your [INAUDIBLE] aunt, I'm afraid.
Particularly a palpitation of the [INAUDIBLE] ventricular
Tricuspid and microvalve, Doctor.
Well, I had to tell her something to satisfy her.
[LAUGHS]
There, there, you mustn't do that.
Now, where's that finger?
You good like Martha.
She give me apples.
Herman like you.
Are you Herman?
Me Herman.
You give me apple, Herman give you nice soft bat.
[DOG BARKING]

[SCREAMING]
[INAUDIBLE]
What is it, Georgiana?
I just found this in Emil's room.
Well?
GEORGIANA: It belonged to my friend, Martha Mueller.
Are you certain?
I gave it to her myself.
Martha died last night.
I find her crucifix in Emil's room.
Doesn't that mean
Emil is the one
Herr Brettschneider was seeking?
This amazes me, Georgiana.
It's impossible.
It rained the night von Ilse died.
There was mud of Emil's shoes the next morning.
Have you mentioned this to anyone?
I intend to tell
Herr Brettschneider
When he calls again.
I can't believe it.
Uh, leave this with me.
I want to talk to Emil before you say anything to anyone.
The Burgermeister should know at once.
Yes, all in good time.
Emil is going to be too [INAUDIBLE]
For us to jump to conclusions.
Don't say anything until I tell you.
And send Emil to me.
Very well, Doctor.
That's for the muritis.
And the [INAUDIBLE].
Is tougher than shoe leather.
And [INAUDIBLE].
That'll help if I come into any harm.
And, uh, ginger... [BURPS] that'll warm my stomach.
Now, a little
[INAUDIBLE] of soda.
[CLEARS THROAT]
Ooh!
Ooh!
[BURPS]
[MEN SHOUTING ANGRILY]
[DOGS BARKING AND HOWLING]
Come on, men!
We've got him!
He can't get away from here now!
Come on, he's around that way!
If he tries to get past you, you know what to do!
[DOGS BARKING]
There he is, [INAUDIBLE].
Here, boys!
Herman?
You're going back to the village with us.
Come on.
We won't hurt you.
No.
No, won't go!
Herman afraid!
Come on!
You're going with us, Herman!
No!
You're going with us!
No!
Come on.
Come on!
Get him!
[DOG BARKING]
Come on, Herman, we won't hurt you.
Come on, Herman.
No!
No.
No!
[SCREAMS]
[DOGS HOWLING]
Come, [INAUDIBLE].
[DOGS HOWLING]
You've got to make certain.
I won't go down there.
Nobody asked you to.
I'll go myself.
Can you see him?
He's on a ledge about 50 feet down.
I'll get a rope.
We've got to make certain, I tell you.
You must be careful, Emil.
Very careful.
No.
It must be.
It must be.
She's no better than the rest.
I've got to go on.
[MOTOR WHIRRING]
[BELL RINGING]
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
Oh, it's you, Doctor.
Good evening.
I'm sorry to have to disturb you, Doctor,
But we simply couldn't make
Georgiana hear the bell.
That's quite all right, my dear.
Georgiana's becoming careless, very careless.
Yes, I've noticed that too.
In my opinion, she has [INAUDIBLE].
That's hidden sickness.
You know [INAUDIBLE].
At first I thought it was [INAUDIBLE],
So I stuck a pin in her leg to see.
And there was a splendid reaction of the, uh,
Reflex motor [INAUDIBLE].
Why, Auntie.
Ha, you're shocked.
So was she.
Won't you join me in some coffee?
Yes, thanks Doctor, we will.
There are a few questions
I'd like to ask you about.
About blood and murders and vampires, I suppose.
Yes, I'm afraid so.
Well, so am I. Well, goodnight.
If such a thing is possible I'm going to bed.
Won't you join us too, Frau Schnappman.
Coffee at this time of the night?
No thank you.
I'm going to stick to my [INAUDIBLE]
Summer salad. [INAUDIBLE].
Goodnight!
What's the news in the village, Karl?
Have they located Herman yet?
No, not a trace of him.
I hate to think of that poor misfit
Being hunted down like a dog.
You know, I simply can't bring myself
To believe in that vampire theory.
Uh, would you pour, Ruth?
Certainly.
I know, Karl.
[INAUDIBLE] common judgment tells us that such things can't
Be, and yet here, for instance, in this ponderous tome
Are cited 1,0001 phobias and complexes
That human beings are err to.
Some of them are strange, more untenable even
Than werewolves and vampires.
Uh, could I have some more, please?
You drink entirely too much coffee.
It's my one weakness.
And also my excuse for tolerating Georgiana's
Laxity in other things.
She does know how to make good coffee.
Thank you.
She brings it to me every night at exactly 10 o'clock.
And when I've drunk it all, then I know it's time to quit.
Yes, and eat breakfast so you can have more coffee.
Oh.
[CHUCKLES]
Georgiana, you mustn't lie like that!
You'll get yourself [INAUDIBLE].
G... Georgiana?
[SCREAMS]
That was Auntie!
Auntie!
Oh!
I'm all right.
I'm all right now.
Emil, help Frau
Schnappman [INAUDIBLE].
AUNT GUSSIE: [INAUDIBLE].
[SCREAMS]
It's OK.
Don't be afraid.
The same two wounds, Doctor.
And my last words to her were angry ones, a petulant
Reprimand for being late with my coffee.
What time was that?
About two or three minutes after 10:00.
She's been then about 45 minutes.
Bloodless, like the rest.
Passes all belief!
Ruth's aunt saw Herman Gleib in the garden this morning.
Could it be that he...?
You were the first one here.
What happened?
I was in my room reading.
My door was open.
I must have dozed off for a minute or so,
Because I awoke to hear
Frau Schnappman scream.
You say your door was open?
Yes, my room was very poorly ventilated.
And you saw nothing?
Heard nothing unusual?
EMIL: Nothing.
Karl.
What is it?
This crucifix belonged to Martha.
[BELL RINGING]
See who it is, Emil.
Can you positively identify this as belonging to Martha?
Without a doubt.
I saw it in her room the night she died.
How in the world did it get here?
Herman Gleib was in her room.
He had that crucifix in his hands.
And Herman was here today.
Maybe here now, for all we know.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
Who is it?
KARL: Karl:
Oh.
How is she?
She's had a real shock this time, but she'll be all right.
I'm putting her to bed.
Leave her there.
Don't let her out of this room.
And don't you leave it, either.
Well, what do you mean?
It looks as if Herman Gleib is the killer after all.
It's possible he may be hiding here in the castle.
What makes you think so?
I'll tell you later.
Stay in your room and keep your door locked.
Don't worry about that.
I heard every word he said.
And I don't think there's any use
Of them searching for Herman.
They should look for a dog, a human-faced dog.
Auntie, the doors and windows are all locked.
There's nothing to be afraid of now.
Well, who said I was afraid?
I'm not a bit afraid.
No, of course you're not afraid,
But you must get some rest.
Rest in this awful place?
With dog-faced Hermans and human-faced bats
And bloods and murders and vampires!
Find anything, Karl?
There's an unbroken cup over in that window.
If Herman did it, he came through the door.
He must've.
And yet I don't understand how he could find
His way up here without us hearing him.
Yet Emil was asleep, and
I was in the library.
Yes, he could have done it.
The facts all point to it.
What was it, Emil?
The Burgermeister.
He has new for Herr
Brettschneider about Herman.
Huh.
Pardon the intrusion,
Doctor, pardon the intrusion.
I knew Karl was here and
I though you wouldn't mind
If I ran in to tell him the news.
About Herman?
Yes.
He fell into the Devil's
Well in the cave.
KARL: He's dead?
BURGERMEISTER:
Dead as a doornail.
This ends our troubles, Karl!
The vampire's dead!
I can feel it in my bones!
Hmm.
Well your bones may be wrong.
What time did this happen?
BURGERMEISTER: Quite early, about 9 o'clock.
The cave is nearly two hours from here.
That's why we didn't hear it sooner.
Well, it may interest you to know that there's
Been another death, after your vampire died.
Who?
Who?
Dr. Niemann's housekeeper, right here in her own room.
Mother of mercy!
What are we going to do?
But a natural death wouldn't kill a vampire, Karl.
You know the expected theory, a stake driven through the heart.
Oh yes, that's the theory all right.
But... but... but...
But what?
But they did!
They drove a stake through his heart!
Good God, are we living in the Middle Ages?
It wasn't through my sanction, Karl.
Sauer did it.
He told me so himself.
Well, that ends the vampire theory as far as I'm concerned.
Herman Gleib died in the accepted fashion
For killing a vampire.
Oh no, there's some human agency at work here, Doctor, a madman
Who kills to satisfy some violent, sadistic urge!
Yes, you're right, Karl.
I've been a fool, a superstitious fool!
Did they leave his body in the cave?
Yes.
Yes, they did.
Well, in view of what's happened,
Don't you think you owe him a decent burial?
You're right.
In view of what has happened, we do owe him that, Karl.
I'll see to it at once, this very instant.
And I'll make arrangements for Georgiana's removal
To the morgue.
Goodnight, Doctor.
Pardon the intrusion.
Goodnight, Gustav.
BURGERMEISTER:
Pardon the intrusion.
[DOOR CLOSES]
Well.
Here I am, just where
I started weeks ago.
There isn't a single theory that doesn't
Lead straight into a stone wall.
I've jested about this vampire business
Because my better judgment told me it was a lot of nonsense.
Then I reached the point where I was willing to accept
Even that, Because it seemed to satisfy the equation.
All of it a bit superstitious.
I don't know which way to turn, where to look,
What to look for!
Why should anyone want human blood?
Why?
Why?!
Calm yourself, Karl.
Calm myself?
Calm myself?
With all these unsolved murders staring me
In the face and no solution in sight?
How much blood is there in a human body, Doctor?
About six liters, approximately.
Can you think of any purpose for which that amount of blood
Might be used?
No, not even in transfusions.
KARL: That's the point which stops me.
There isn't any other use for human blood.
Gah!
Murderers leave clues!
And these atrocities are murders, Doctor.
Those simple fools in the village
Can believe what they like.
But you and I are sane, thinking people.
And you know and I know,
Doctor, that these are murders!
The last one was done here, in this very house,
Right under this roof.
All right, I'll start here.
I'm going over every foot of this place,
Both inside and out.
Nobody, sane or insane, is clever enough
To get away with murder without leaving a clue of some sort!
And I'm going to find that clue!
Come, come Karl, you musn't let your nerves run away with you.
Here, these.
These will help to give you a good night's sleep.
If there are any clues, they'll be here in the morning
When your nerves are calm and your... your mind is clear.
Take my advice and go home and rest.
I imagined a thousand demons were
After me as I came down those stairs!
Ruth, didn't I tell you to stay in your room?
Yes, but I wanted the doctor to come up and quiet Auntie.
You know, it isn't her imagination this time.
Of course, Ruth.
I'll come right away.
Take my advice, young man.
Go home and go to bed.
Goodnight, Karl.
Goodnight, Ruth.
DR. VON NIEMANN:
Goodnight, Karl.
Goodnight, Doctor.
[CLOCK CHIMING]
If his lights are on, you must wait, Emil.
Wait until he has gone to bed.
Handle him as you did the others, Emil.
You are strong, very strong.
I am waiting for you, waiting for you
To bring him to the laboratory.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
You!
You're the one!
What mad thing are you doing?
Mad?
Is one who has sold the secret of life to be considered mad?
Life!
Created in the laboratory!
No mere crystalline growth, but tissue, living, growing tissue,
Life that moves, pulsates, and demands
Food for its continued growth!
Ha, you shudder in horror.
So did I the first time.
But what are a few lives being weighed in the balance
Against the achievement of biological science?
Think of it.
I have lifted the babe.
I have created life, wrested the secret of life from life!
Now do you understand?
From the lives of those who have gone before,
I have created life!
I'll tell Karl!
You may, for tonight Karl's name will be added to yours,
And all of those who misachieved within mortal lives.
[MACHINE WHIRRING]
I didn't take your sleeping tablets, Doctor.
Emil brought them here.
He's the one who murdered them!
Stay where you are.
You'll have a chance to tell everything, Doctor.
[THUMPING AND STOMPING NOISES]
I'll take care of von Niemann!
Get her out of here!
[GUNSHOT]
[CRASH]
You stay here.
[GUNSHOT]
Von Niemann and Emil.
Doctor!
Dr. von Niemann!
Karl, she mustn't see them.
Where is Dr. von Niemann!
I must see him immediately.
Aunt Gussie, you can't.
He's... he can't be disturbed.
Oh, but I must see him!
I simply must!
That hydrous magnesium sulfate he gave me is, uh,
Affecting me most peculiarly.
You'll pardon me.
Hydrous magnesium sulfate.
Why, that's epsom salt!
[MUSIC PLAYING]
- Ain't you afraid?
- Of old Ygor? No.
- I say that I, for one, will not.
- Enough!
He'll be met exactly as arranged.
Now, friends, on his deathbed... the old Baron Frankenstein gave me this chest of papers... to deliver to his son, and deliver it I shall.
Haven't we had enough of that name here?
There was a time when our village was prosperous and happy. Look at it now.
Forsaken, desolate, shunned by every traveller, and why?
Because of these Frankensteins.
We live in the black shadow of that cursed place up on the hill... where only that crazy Ygor, with his broken neck, dares to stay.
And now we go to the railway station to welcome another Frankenstein.
This one is probably just as bad as his father... who created a monster in the devil's own image.
It's in the blood, I tell you.
We've said these same words a thousand times, and they get us nowhere.
Fine talk, Herr Inspector.
But Baron Frankenstein does arrive tonight to claim his heritage.
- And then what?
- Yes, what then?
That's true, but he'll find no friends here.
Nothing but locked doors and darkened windows... locked hearts and bitter hatred.
Let that, too, be a part of the Frankenstein heritage.
Come, gentlemen.
We'll be there soon, darling.
That's good. So I can see Amelia.
That's right. Amelia will be there waiting for you, and so glad to see you.
What strange-looking country.
Not much like America, is it?
On my first trip to Europe,
I was prepared for anything... but I'm glad we went to London and Paris first.
We must be getting close to the village now.
It's exciting, isn't it?
Out there in the darkness, a new life lies before us.
No more college classrooms or faculty meetings.
- I feel rather like an explorer.
- That's what it is.
We're going to explore something so foreign to us... we can't even imagine what it'll be like.
A medieval castle.
I wonder if there's a moat.
And a drawbridge, and a great tall, dark tower.
And battlements.
Perhaps there's a haunted room.
Yes, there's sure to be a haunted room.
The castle itself is supposed to be haunted.
- Because of...
- Yes.
Because of the things my father did there.
I remember the stories Mother used to tell me when I was quite young in England.
It wasn't my father's fault that the being he created... became a senseless, murderous monster.
He was right.
You understand that, don't you, dear?
He was right.
It was the unforeseen blunder of a stupid assistant... that gave his creation the brain of a killer instead of a normal one.
And how my father was made to suffer for that mistake.
His name has become synonymous with horror and monsters.
Why, nine out of ten people... call that misshapen creature of my father's experiments...
Frankenstein.
- Herr Baron Frankenstein?
- Yes.
I will see that madam and the bags are placed in the car.
The Burgomaster's on the platform waiting for you.
Thank you.
- Herr Baron Frankenstein?
- Yes.
I am Burgomaster of the village.
It's a great pleasure to see you,
Herr Burgomaster.
These are the gentlemen of the council.
We come to meet you, not to greet you.
I deliver you these, on the instructions of your late father.
Thank you.
The large box contains certain papers pertaining to the estate.
- The small one, the key that will open it.
- Thank you, I...
It is unfortunate that we cannot offer you a more cheerful welcome.
But we can't.
Herr Burgomaster, gentlemen of the council, villagers.
I quite realise that it was my father's misfortune... to be the unwilling, unknowing cause of tragedy.
I'm so sorry that I don't remember him... because I've been told that he was a good man.
And I know how greatly your tragedy must have weighed upon his mind.
I can't undo the wrongs that you've suffered... but I beg of you, let the dead past remain buried.
My wife and I, and our son... we want so much to be your friends.
There is a car waiting, Herr Baron.
Thank you. Thank you for your courtesy.
- There's my little darling!
- Amelia!
I am glad to see you, Benson.
- Thank you, sir. Should I take this?
- No, just take my coat, will you?
I'm so glad to see you.
Bless you.
What a comfort to find you here.
- Welcome, madam. Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, Amelia.
Peter had better go right to bed.
It's been a long trip.
Come along, darling.
Amelia, are the bedrooms cheery?
Yes, madam, quite cheery.
I think you'll be surprised.
It's medieval.
It's exciting, exhilarating.
You really feel that you belong here already?
Yes, I think I do.
Why? Don't you like it?
It all seems so unreal, but I'm excited, too.
Good night, Daddy!
Daddy, look at me.
I'm way up here on a mountain.
Good night, son.
I'll go and freshen up a bit and see that Peter is put to bed.
I'm terribly glad you're here with me.
Amelia, wait for me.
I don't want to get lost.
Where did you get those other servants?
They look like Tyroleans.
They are. None of the people of this province would serve here... no matter what I offered to pay them.
Strange, superstitious creatures.
- Where's the library, if there is a library?
- Here it is, sir.
I think you're rather like your father, sir.
If only I could have some small portion of his genius.
Think of it, Benson.
Here, in this very study... the luminous facets of his brilliant mind conceived his outstanding theory... of the source of life.
Here, he planned a miracle... and saw it come to pass.
A miracle that the good people of Frankenstein called a monster.
They call it a lot worse than that, sir.
Such stories as I've never heard.
- Would you like a brandy, sir?
- Yes, thank you, Benson.
"My son.
"Herein you will find my faiths, my beliefs, and my unfoldments.
"A complete diary of my experiments, charts, and secret formulas.
"In short, the sum total of my knowledge, such as it is.
"Perhaps you will regard my work with ridicule or even with distaste.
"If so, destroy these records.
"But if you, like me, burn with the irresistible desire...
"to penetrate the unknown, carry on.
"Even though the path is cruel and torturous, carry on.
"Like every seeker after truth...
"you will be hated, blasphemed, and condemned.
"But mayhap where I have failed, you will succeed.
"You have inherited the fortune of the Frankensteins.
"I trust you will not inherit their fate."
To you, sir.
Our Father... help me be a good little boy, and bless Mummy and Daddy. Amen.
Good night, my darling.
I'll close the curtains, madam, so the lightning won't bother him.
Please don't close them,
'cause I like lightning.
He isn't afraid of anything, is he, madam?
His father has taught him never to be afraid, and he isn't.
Do you think he'll be all right here?
Yes, madam. Nothing can happen to him.
I'll leave my door open.
Please do.
Why do you suppose they ever built in these beds in this strange position?
An old superstition.
"If the house is filled with dread, place the beds at head-to-head."
Come on, gentlemen, see!
More bags for Frankenstein.
- Good evening, Inspector.
- Good evening.
- The Baron is in, I know.
- Yes, but...
A policeman.
- Herr Baron Frankenstein?
- Yes.
I am Inspector Krogh of the district police.
I am glad to see you, Inspector.
Benson, take the Inspector's cape.
Yes, sir.
- Won't you come in?
- Thank you.
- Come over and dry out by the fire.
- Thank you.
I've been studying some old papers of my father's.
- Care for a brandy?
- Thank you, no.
I have come here, Herr Baron, to assure you of protection.
- Protection? From whom?
- From a virulent and fatal poison.
Am I to be poisoned, then?
You are poisoned already by your name.
To the best of my knowledge, it has served my family faithfully for over 700 years.
You recommend that I change it to, say, Smith?
I'm afraid that wouldn't help.
You might change your name, but you can't erase the brand. That's indelible.
As long as you continue to live in this place, you're in danger.
You're speaking in riddles, Herr Inspector.
Danger from whom?
The Burgomaster and his inhospitable villagers?
I think I can guarantee to control their animosity, but not their fears.
What are they afraid of, ghosts?
Perhaps.
I'm afraid I don't believe in them. Do you?
When they commit murder, yes.
- You're referring to the monster.
- Perhaps.
My dear Inspector, he was destroyed years ago.
Perhaps.
Can we stick to facts, Inspector?
That my father instilled life into a dead man is perfectly true.
But I'm also convinced that stories of this creature... have been so greatly exaggerated in the telling and the retelling... that the simple folk of this neighbourhood now believe him to have been... the most fiendish monster that ever walked this earth.
Do you honestly know of one criminal act that this poor creature committed?
Did you ever even see him?
The most vivid recollection of my life.
I was but a child at the time, about the age of your own son.
The monster had escaped and was ravaging the countryside... killing, maiming, terrorising.
One night, he burst into our house.
My father took a gun and fired at him... but the savage brute sent him crashing to a corner.
Then he grabbed me by the arm.
One doesn't easily forget, Herr Baron, an arm torn out by the roots.
No, I...
My lifelong ambition was to have been a soldier.
But for this...
I, who command seven gendarmes in a little mountain village... might have been a general.
I wish I could do something to...
- Won't you change your mind for brandy?
- Thank you, Baron.
I apologise if I've aroused your sympathy... but I have found that by explaining my affliction... it ceases to be quite such a curiosity.
You said there have been other murders committed since the destruction of the...
- Of my father's work.
- Yes.
- How do you account for it?
- Well, I can't.
Neither can the special agents imported for the purpose from Scotland Yard... and the Sureté Francaise.
There have been six, all unsolved... and all men of some prominence in the village.
In each case, the autopsy disclosed that death was caused by a violent concussion.
There were no marks on the bodies... except a slight discoloration or bruise at the base of the brain.
But the hearts of all the victims were ruptured.
In fact, they had burst.
Hence the local superstition of the murdering ghost.
Need I add that it is always alluded to as Frankenstein?
Now it's rumoured that you, like your father, are a scientist.
The villagers have seen the strange instruments that preceded you.
That's why I've come to warn you.
Inspector Krogh,
I should indeed seem ungrateful... if I were not to thank you for your interest in my welfare.
But I can assure you
I am not engaged in any black magic... nor in the creation of monsters, however the villagers may think.
Nevertheless, Herr Baron,
I stand ready when you need help.
I shall not need it.
When you need help, you have but to ring the alarm bell in the tower... and I shall hear it wherever I may be and hasten to your assistance.
- Good night, Herr Baron.
- Good night and thank you, Inspector.
Darling, this is Inspector Krogh of the police.
- How do you do?
- Madam.
He called to assure us that he's at our service.
It's very good of you, Inspector.
Perhaps you'll honour us one night soon at dinner.
Madam, I...
I shall be honoured, madam.
Wasn't he odd?
Yes. He said if the villagers bothered us, he'd take a hand.
We seem to be rather undesirable characters.
They'll change their attitude when they get to know us a little better.
What a dreadful storm.
What awful lightning!
It's magnificent.
Nothing in nature is terrifying when one understands it.
Think of it, darling.
My father drew that very lightning from heaven and forced it to his own will... to bring life to a being that he created with his own hands.
Why should we fear anything?
Thank you, Benson.
Well, hello!
Good morning, son.
- Did you have a nice sleep?
- Yes.
- What are you going to do now?
- I'm going out hunting.
- What are you going to get?
- Elephants and tigers.
That's fine. You better come along down here. There's some stairs over there.
You see, it isn't so bad in daylight, is it?
No, but I just hope we don't have any more nights like last night.
It's nights like that that make beautiful mornings like this.
I'm going to look over the estate... and I'm going to take my gun with me, too.
You never can tell what you'll see, can you, Peter?
You might see some rhinoceros or alligators.
What's that, Daddy?
That? That's a boar.
Like Aunt Fanny?
No, Peter, not like Aunt Fanny.
A wild boar.
I hope I don't have teeth like that.
- Why, darling?
- They'd be too hard to clean.
Now you run along with Amelia.
Don't go far.
- Goodbye, Peter.
- Goodbye.
What's that weird-looking structure across the ravine?
That's my father's laboratory.
They blew the roof off when the monster was destroyed.
I can't wait to see inside it.
Sulphur.
Hey, you, come down here!
Come on, hurry up.
Come on, get up.
Why did you try to kill me?
- I thought you came here to kill me.
- That's a fine story.
It's all right for you people to hate me, but attempted murder is another thing.
Who are you?
My name is Ygor.
Let me go, Frankenstein.
- I'm turning you over to Inspector Krogh.
- No!
- Not give me to Krogh.
- Why?
Krogh not want dead man. Ygor is dead.
What are you talking about?
You see that?
They hanged me once, Frankenstein.
They broke my neck.
They said I was dead.
Then they cut me down.
Hanged you?
- Why did they hang you?
- Because I stole bodies...
- they said.
- Yes. Well, what are you doing here?
They threw me in here long ago.
They wouldn't bury me in holy place like churchyard... because I stole bodies, they said.
So Ygor is dead.
You Dr. Frankenstein, like your father?
Yes, but I can't mend a broken neck.
Nobody can mend Ygor's neck.
It's all right.
So you doctor?
Yes, I'm a doctor, amongst other things.
You come with me.
My grandfather.
My father.
Is this what you wanted to show me?
He's alive!
- How long has he been here?
- Long time.
He is my friend.
He does things for me.
- Has he always been here?
- Nearly always.
This is place of the dead.
We're all dead here.
- But he's not dead.
- No, not dead.
Asleep.
Sick.
He has been so many months.
What happened?
- Did you...
- Oh, no.
It happened one night when he was outside.
Outside?
Yes. He was... hunting.
There was a great storm.
He was standing under tree... when lightning strike.
- How did he get in here?
- I find him and bring him home.
But he walks no more.
Evidence of trauma... exactly the same as a human being.
- He was supposed to be destroyed.
- No.
He cannot be destroyed.
Cannot die.
Your father made him live for always.
Now he is sick.
Make him well, Frankenstein.
- I don't know whether I...
- Your father made him.
And Heinrich Frankenstein was your father, too.
Do you mean to imply then that... that is my brother?
But his mother was lightning.
Electricity. We'll see.
I'll get my instruments from the castle.
We'll take him up there.
No!
You cannot take him away.
Just up there in the old laboratory... where I have light and room.
Please. You understand.
No one must see him, Frankenstein.
But does anyone know that he's here?
Good.
And no one will know that he is here... until your creation, Father, walks again.
What's going on at Castle Frankenstein?
The whole village is alarmed with anxiety.
- Our men report nothing but quiet.
- Quiet?
There's nothing so ominous as quiet.
Besides, it isn't quiet.
From the cemetery on Crag Hill...
Hans Stenble can see Castle Frankenstein with his field glasses.
The servants have been moving large crates and boxes into the old laboratory.
They even have old Ygor helping them.
We Frankensteinians are as nervous as cats.
We grovel at the howl of a wolf.
When the wind slams the door or a shutter... we tremble in our shoes and hide ourselves like frightened rabbits.
And always will with a Frankenstein in our midst.
What's he doing?
That's all we want to know.
Yes, we want to know.
Let's get Ygor here and make him tell us.
Yes!
All right, Ygor, make it fast.
Ready?
Ready!
No!
What's the matter with you?
What are you doing?
He cannot come in here. No one.
You want me to make him well?
Very well, then. I'll need some help.
This man is not just my servant.
He's been with me for years, helping me with my experiments.
I need him now to make notes.
All right, I'll not make him well.
But if he tells...
All right, come along, Benson.
Get your notes, Benson.
Iris contracted.
Marked sclerectasia.
Mental abnormality.
Considerable osteodermia in the frontal region.
Apparently these are the exterior electrodes.
The means by which my father inducted the vital energy into the body.
Systolic pressure, over 300.
Diastolic, over 220. Three times normal.
Definite hyperpituitary. Minus 65.
That accounts for his great size.
No human heart could possibly function like that... especially in his condition.
It's beating at over 250 to the minute.
He's completely superhuman.
Get your notes, Benson.
Left ventricular preponderance.
And look at this, Benson.
- Do you know what those are?
- No.
Bullets. Two bullets in his heart.
But he still lives.
I've never seen blood like that before.
Polymorphocellular.
Extreme hemachrosis.
The alpha leukocytes apparently do not dissolve.
The structure of the blood is quite different from that of a normal human being.
The cells seem to be battling one another... as if they had a conscious life of their own.
- What was in those boxes?
- All kinds of things. Machines.
- What kind of machines?
- All kinds.
Wheels turn around, electric lightnings come out.
Bottles, big ones, little ones.
Medicine. All kinds.
He doctor.
I don't understand his business.
I am blacksmith.
Body snatcher, you mean?
Yes.
Has he asked you to rob any graves?
- To get him a body?
- No!
Tell us the truth, or we'll hang you again and make a better job of it next time.
No, you no can hang me again. Can they?
No, that's been settled.
You were hanged and pronounced dead.
But he was not dead.
He was pronounced dead by Dr. Burgher.
And all the others Burgher's pronounced dead for the last 30 years... have been dead, haven't they?
If Ygor came to life again, it's the devil's work, not the court's.
You mean that if he commits another crime, he can't be hanged again?
- Yes, but...
- I do nothing.
I help Frankenstein.
He good man. He pay me money.
Well, you watch him.
And if he starts to do anything like his father and you don't tell us...
I'll see that you hang again.
You? Alone?
It took eight men before to say I was to be hanged.
The same eight will find you guilty again.
So?
- The same eight aren't here, Weber.
- No?
Well, I'm one of the eight, and I'll be one again with pleasure.
You, Neumüller.
You were one.
And I, too.
Yes. You, too, Lang.
That's right. I remember.
That's all here now?
Yes.
The other six are all dead.
They die. Dead.
I die. Live.
Quiet! That'll be all, Ygor.
Go back to Castle Frankenstein and be careful.
- You spit on me!
- I am sorry. I cough.
You see, bone get stuck in my throat.
The results of my extensive examinations establish beyond doubt... that the creature was brought to life originally... by an electrical impulse of terrifying potency.
It appears that my father thought that he could extract from lightning... some super-violet ray of life-giving properties.
From a careful analysis of his electrical hookup...
I've learned that he actually attracted cosmic rays... which neither he, nor anyone else in the world of science at that time... even knew existed.
Of course, since then, many of our most profound scientists... have come to believe that these rays are actually the very source of life itself.
This creature is indeed a monster.
There is not one part of his physical being that's like that of human beings.
From his warped brain... down to the tiniest argumentative cell of his huge carcass... he's unearthly.
Every fantastic story told of him by the people of Frankenstein...
I now believe to be absolutely true.
I, as a man... should destroy him.
But as a scientist...
I should do everything in my power to bring him back to conscious life... so that the world can study his abnormal functions.
That would vindicate my father... and his name would be enshrined among the immortals.
Benson, turn on the generator.
- Stop!
- Quiet, you fool!
It's no good, Ygor.
I've done everything I can.
I'm afraid we'll never get him out of this coma.
Come on, Benson.
Take off these electrodes.
I'm not going to work at Castle Frankenstein any longer.
I've seen enough to make me suspicious.
I'm going to quit.
No, you're not.
You'll stay there and report to me everything you see and hear.
I'll call there myself this afternoon.
You'll be well repaid.
Now go back and don't tell anyone you've seen me.
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.
I'd like very much to visit the village, but I'm ashamed to say I don't dare.
I think you're very wise, madam.
There's a definite feeling of tension there... and I'm sure you'll be much better off not to risk the discourtesy of the villagers.
Yes, that's what Wolf said.
I suspect the Baron, too, finds time heavy on his hands here.
No, never. He's almost constantly in his laboratory.
- Laboratory?
- Yes.
He's fixed over his father's old one, you know.
He's deep in some experiment.
I see. What sort of experiment?
I'm sure I don't know.
I never bother him at times like this.
He's terribly preoccupied now.
But as soon as his problem's solved, he'll be as gay as a lark again.
He's like that.
- Is he in his laboratory now?
- No.
He came in to lunch looking grey as a ghost.
I could see he was on pins and needles... so I suggested that he go out into the open air for a while.
He's been gone for hours.
- You don't mind being left alone?
- Not in the daytime, but at night...
- Good afternoon, Inspector.
- Good afternoon, Herr Baron.
- I trust you enjoyed your walk.
- Yes, very much.
There's nothing like a good walk through the woods for clearing one's mind.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.
Yes, you scientists must have to have clear minds and steady nerves.
The Baroness has just been telling me that you're knee-deep in experiments.
- Yes.
- And working in your father's laboratory?
The villagers call it
"the Monster's home."
Haven't seen him stalking about by any chance, have you?
No.
- I fear he'll never stalk again.
- That's a relief.
But I'm curious to know why you chose that place to work.
- It was my father's.
- But without a roof?
I sealed it up with some heavy canvas.
Don't the sulphur fumes bother you?
- No, not at all.
- Sulphur fumes?
Forgive me, perhaps I shouldn't have mentioned that. I thought madam knew.
- Tell me.
- You see, our family history states... that the structure was built by the Romans over a natural sulphur pit... and used by them as mineral baths.
One of the first health resorts, perhaps.
Health resort.
Yes, possibly.
But during the succeeding centuries, the boiling sulphur increased in its intensity... until now, I believe, it is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.
- Exactly.
- Even the stoutest Roman... couldn't venture into that today... without being parboiled to the bones in just a few moments.
Wolf, you do pick the strangest places.
I'd like to see how you fixed it up.
I'll have you come there some time and parboil you.
Well, hello!
- Mother, may I come in?
- Come on in, son.
Peter, this is Inspector Krogh.
- How do you do?
- How do you do, sir?
You're not supposed to shake hands with a left hand.
I'm sorry. That was very rude of me.
You're not supposed to wear gloves in the house, either.
- Son.
- Sorry again.
But, you see, I only have one real arm.
This one isn't mine.
Well, whose is it?
You see, Inspector Krogh lost his other real arm... in the war.
He's a soldier.
- Are you a general?
- No, he's more than a general.
He's an inspector.
Well, I'm a soldier myself, and I've been hunting all day long.
Hunting? Did you get anything?
Yes, a few elephants and a few tigers.
Did you have a nice long nap, darling?
No, not a very long nap.
A giant came in here and woke me up.
A giant? What an imagination.
No, Amelia, it wasn't imagination.
It was a giant and he woke me up.
And when I got up, he had a hold of my arm.
Did you chase him away with your gun?
No, he was a nice giant.
I gave him my picture book and then he went away.
Are there lots of giants around here?
Only one that I ever heard of.
That must have been him, then.
Perhaps.
You're pretty much of a giant yourself, aren't you?
Aren't we getting heavy?
Excuse me, Inspector.
I'll take him up to the nursery.
It's almost his suppertime.
Here we go.
It must be that book
Jack the Giant Killer... that's got into his head with his great imagination.
Here we go up the big mountain.
Duck your head.
Hold tight. We're almost there.
Here we are.
Now, Peter...
I want you to tell me all about the elephants, the tigers... and that giant.
Really, Daddy, there weren't any elephants and tigers.
I just made-believe that.
- But what about the giant?
- What giant?
The one you gave your storybook to.
He's real.
What did he look like?
He was a great big man with a hairy coat on.
And he walked like this.
What an imagination!
Yes. See you later, son.
What a boy!
Going out, Herr Baron?
Yes, I just remembered a thing
I have to check in my laboratory.
I almost forgot the time.
I'm getting sort of absent-minded.
I'll have to hurry, if you'll excuse me.
Ygor!
Ygor!
Ygor!
How did he get out of here?
You make him well with your lightning.
After you go, he get up and walk.
Now he's all right again.
Come.
Good man.
He must never get out again. Never.
He just do what I tell him, always.
See?
Go.
No one must know that he's here.
No one know now, but you and Benson man.
He'll never tell.
No, he will never tell.
Come.
Igor.
Ygor, I made him walk, but I haven't made him well.
He isn't well here. You understand?
I must continue my experiments.
He's well enough for me... and you no touch him again.
If you want him to be well, you must keep him here always.
- Understand?
- I keep him here.
You sent for me, sir?
Yes, Benson.
Inspector Krogh is still in the library.
I can't stand his suspicious look, so I called you in here.
Yes, sir.
- Benson, it's alive!
- Alive? You mean...
- Yes, alive!
- But you said our experiment...
I know. I, too, at first thought that we failed, but I've actually seen it walk.
Walk?
It's like some huge animal.
Never in my life have I known cold fear... until that moment that I felt his hand on my shoulder.
I was like a child's doll in those huge hands.
He could have crushed me as I would have crushed an eggshell.
- How did you escape him, sir?
- Ygor came in.
It's amazing the control he exercises over that thing.
It's hypnosis, or something more elemental perhaps.
- What are you going to do about it?
- Do? Continue my experiments.
- But what if he...
- I'm not worried.
He's dangerous, of course, but he loves Ygor and obeys him.
My problem is how to make Ygor obey me.
But what about madam and Master Peter, sir?
Oh, yes, I'll have to send them away.
I'll suggest tonight that they make a trip to Brussels.
Get some tickets for the noon train tomorrow.
I hope you forgive me speaking my way, but I've served you for many years.
I think it would be better if you called in
Inspector Krogh and told him everything.
No, I will not!
I have begun this thing and I'll finish it.
I'll not be halted by anything... till I'm the complete master of this living, breathing, intelligent creature... my father dreamed of creating.
- Herr Neumüller. How are you?
- Fine, Schmidt.
- Thank you.
- I hope you don't feel I'm an intruder.
Not at all, Inspector.
Well, I practically invited myself to dinner, but I...
No, of course not.
It's a great pleasure to have you.
You're our first guest.
I never thought I'd have the privilege of being entertained at Castle Frankenstein.
No, it's a great pleasure to have you here.
You see, you're our first guest.
You just said that, didn't you, dear?
Well, you are.
Where is Benson?
Why isn't he serving dinner?
We don't know, madam.
He went up to the nursery for the baby's supper tray... and we haven't seen him since.
Have you seen him, Wolf?
Yes, dear.
I sent him over to the laboratory to get some notes for me... that I want to work on after dinner tonight.
But how long ago?
Perhaps my instructions were a little complicated... and he may have become confused.
You know, he hates to make mistakes.
That awful knocker.
Fritz, will you see who it is, please?
Wolf, couldn't we install an old-fashioned doorbell?
That boom almost makes me jump out of my skin.
Yes, dear, I'll have a bell put in.
The knocker must have been used in the old days to arouse the entire household.
A sort of call to arms in times of danger.
It's one of your men, Inspector.
There has been an accident in the village.
A sudden death.
He requested that you come at once.
I'm terribly sorry. Please excuse me.
What a shame to leave a delicious dinner like this for so sordid a thing as...
I trust that nothing has happened to your butler, madam.
- Thank you.
- Good night.
Baron.
I think you ought to try and find Benson.
I'm terribly worried about him.
- Yes, I will.
- But don't go alone.
Silly. I'll be all right.
- What's the matter with him?
- He's asleep.
- Have you seen Benson?
- Yes.
- When?
- About two hours ago.
- Where?
- Here.
He say you tell him monster walk again.
He came to see.
Monster walk.
Benson run!
Where did he run to?
He isn't at the castle.
He just run away in the woods.
That thing's enough to scare anyone.
I didn't think Benson would come here.
Are you telling me the truth?
You didn't kill him?
No.
Why, I scare him to death.
I don't have to kill him to death.
Where does the ladder into the sulphur pit lead to?
- A cave.
- A cave?
It's warm. We stay there in winter.
- Where does the cave lead to?
- Just cave.
My deepest sympathies, Frau Neumüller.
How did it happen?
He must have been asleep and fallen off his wagon.
The wheels passed over his legs breaking them, and crushing his chest.
See here?
Will you all leave while Dr. Burgher and I make out the death certificates?
Any other marks or bruises?
Examine the back of the neck.
- You don't think that...
- Perhaps.
We won't know until you perform an autopsy.
Examine the heart, and report to me at once.
- What happened to Benson?
- I don't know, really, dear.
I've been working him pretty hard lately.
Maybe he just wanted to go out and get drunk.
But Benson doesn't drink.
Well, perhaps he does sometimes.
He'll be back in the morning bright and early. You'll see.
- Don't worry about him.
- It's you I'm worried about.
You aren't yourself.
Are you keeping something from me?
No, darling.
Is this place getting on your nerves?
I hate it here, Wolf.
- I'm terribly afraid all the time.
- I'm sorry, dear.
I'm going to send you and Peter away in the morning.
I want you to take a trip to Brussels, and I'll follow you in a few days.
I've tried so desperately to match your bravery, but...
My dear.
I'll be all right.
There's a good girl.
- Where are you going?
- To get Peter.
I'll feel better having him in here with me.
No!
Good morning, Inspector.
You're up rather early, aren't you?
You're early yourself, Baron.
I came to inquire about your butler.
Have you found him, dead or alive?
No, but he'll be back.
He's done this sort of thing before.
These sudden disappearances.
Can I give you a light?
Thank you, no.
He was in the war, you know.
He was wounded in the head.
It makes him rather funny at times.
But don't worry about him.
I'm going down to the village.
Will you come along with me?
The village? There's not a shop open.
No, I'm going to the railroad station.
My wife and child are going away for a slight holiday.
So?
So, you see, I have to do all the arranging myself...
- now that that stupid Benson's gone.
- I'm afraid I must ask you not to go, Baron.
Neither you, nor your wife, or child.
That accidental death that called me from your dinner last night... was another burst heart.
Listen.
Ygor, shut up!
He's been playing that thing all night.
There's a mob at your gate.
They have a strange notion that you had something to do with it.
Silly, isn't it?
Silly? They're mad.
I'll go down there and tell them so.
- No, you won't go, Baron.
- Why?
We'll talk it over... inside.
All right, if you like.
- Inspector.
- Madam.
My dear, I assume from the Inspector's attitude and pointed implications...
- That I'm under arrest.
- Arrest?
It appears we've returned to the Middle Ages.
The villagers have laid siege to the castle and are crying out for blood!
Madam, I...
A man is murdered a mile away, and do you know what killed him?
My name.
The very name of Frankenstein burst his heart.
And now the happy little villagers are clamouring for my blood!
I'm afraid the Baron is in a humorous mood this morning.
I suppose it has its humorous side, but you're not under arrest, madam.
I'm merely here to guarantee you protection against any unprovoked assault.
Unprovoked assault!
Inspector, you mean it isn't safe for us to leave?
I'm afraid not, madam.
But is there any reason why you shouldn't be perfectly safe here?
If one simple-minded villager as much as sets foot inside that door...
I'll shoot him like a dog!
You can tell them that for me... as long as you won't allow me to tell them myself.
I've never seen him so violent.
Madam, last night I missed my dinner, and this morning I've had no breakfast.
Now, do you think...
Certainly. I'll order some at once. If you'll...
Herr Baron, shall we go into the library?
I prefer to remain here, thank you.
Shall we go into the library?
I don't mind telling you, Inspector, that as a guest in my own house... you'll find me extremely disagreeable.
Sailing, sailing, over the bounding main
- May I come in?
- Come in, Inspector, please.
Thank you. Hello, young man.
- Your mother said I could visit you.
- Hello, General.
I'll be back in a moment, darling.
Excuse me, please.
You see, I have no young son of my own.
Oh, that's too bad.
- Have you done any more hunting lately?
- Yes.
- Has the giant paid you any more visits?
- Yes.
- He's a great big fellow, I imagine.
- Yes.
So big, possibly, he can hardly get through that door?
No, he doesn't come through the door.
No? Where does he come in?
Through the window? The fireplace?
- Through the wall.
- Through the wall?
- Where?
- Over there.
That's very interesting.
You're not afraid of him at all, are you, Peter?
No, he's a nice giant.
He gave me a watch.
- A watch?
- Yes.
- Would you like to see it?
- Very much.
Thank you.
Yes, it's a very nice watch. A very... nice watch.
Peter, shall we go downstairs and have some nice hot chocolate?
Yes.
- If the General will come with me.
- I'll be very pleased, sir.
Here we go.
- Hurry up.
- All right, I'm coming.
Superstitious, blundering idiot!
Prying, insinuating, accusing.
I'll kick him out of the house!
I'll not be heckled by a stupid, intolerable policeman.
Wolf, the way you're carrying on... if I were a policeman,
I'd be suspicious myself.
- You would?
- Yes, I would.
Mysterious things have happened.
A murder in the village.
Our own dear Benson disappears for no reason.
They probably think you, like your father, have created another monster or...
He's got even you, my own wife, believing that I...
I believe nothing.
I don't care about Krogh.
But I'm afraid for you, for Peter.
And only you, Wolf, can restore my confidence.
Please, darling, Elsa, please have faith in me!
I'm sorry that I lost control of myself.
I've no reason for being nervous like this.
But I've been working too hard.
A terrific experiment, one that I wanted to surprise you with... one that would establish me and my work. My work... as something outstanding in the world of science.
But believe me, darling, there's nothing to be afraid of.
I wouldn't be afraid if I hadn't, for the first time, sensed you were afraid.
Me? Oh, silly.
Everything's under control.
I'll not lose my temper again. You'll see.
Inspector.
Sorry, young man. I shan't be able to take chocolate with you.
Tell your father and mother
I'll be back very soon.
- Goodbye, General.
- Krantz, remain here on guard.
Now I can go to the lab.
I mean, I must go to the lab.
Only for a minute, dear.
I won't be long, really.
No touch him, Frankenstein!
No touch him... or something happens to you worse than dying.
- How long has he been here?
- All night.
You liar! He was in the village.
- You made him kill Herr Neumüller.
- Yes, why not?
Neumüller kills me.
Eight men say Ygor hang.
Now eight men dead.
- All dead!
- You crazy fool!
If Krogh finds him, he'll kill him.
Then he won't be any good to either of us.
You get out of here. If I find you hanging around here again, I'll...
He's mine! He no belong to you!
You go away, not me!
Get back!
Where is everybody?
The Baron's in the library, sir.
The rest of the family are at dinner.
I've had to send to Bandleheim for additional police.
Krantz, you report to Sgt. Schiller at the lower gate.
- The crowd is becoming unmanageable.
- Herr Inspector.
Come in.
Good evening, Inspector.
I thought that I'd see you sooner.
Sorry. I've been busy.
Very busy indeed, for me.
My job is usually a rather sleepy one.
- Have a drink?
- Thank you, no.
I'm afraid I shall require all the wits I've got tonight.
I've never seen you disturbed before, Inspector.
- You've even forgotten to take off your hat.
- Not forgotten, Herr Baron.
Merely a matter of form.
My business tonight is official, not social.
Rather a crude custom, I agree... but a custom.
Well, sir, what news from the front?
Another death. Another inquest.
When did it occur? This afternoon?
No. Sometime last night.
It was only discovered late this morning.
Herr Lang, this time.
The village apothecary.
A very old and dear friend.
He'll be mourned.
- Too bad.
- Yes, isn't it?
Herr Lang? Never heard of him before. Oh, well.
I suppose the villagers will say
I killed him, just the same.
No, not that you killed him, but that you know who did.
Really? But of course I know who did.
Haven't you heard? The Monster!
Yes, that's what they think.
Is it the old legendary monster of my father's time... or am I supposed to have whipped one up... as a housewife whips up an omelette?
I've been here over a month, you know.
Your wife and child are in danger.
So? From what?
- You tried to send them away.
- I will tomorrow, in spite of you.
You forget I have my hat on.
Meaning that I'm under arrest?
Yes.
I promised your arrest to the villagers to keep them quiet for the moment.
For the murder of Lang and Neumüller?
No. For the murder of Benson.
A technical charge, for the time being.
Why don't you search the laboratory?
You have my permission.
I've searched it already without your permission... with two men the other night.
We found nothing incriminating but a very large table... fit for a giant.
Yes, it was my father's.
I reconstructed it out of curiosity.
Why don't you search it again?
By George...
I think I know who your monster may be.
Good. Who?
Old Ygor.
Of course. Why not?
Everybody wants to hang old Ygor again... yet he has a perfect alibi.
He was constantly under observation when every murder was committed.
It's curious that the entire jury that hanged him is dead.
But he was never seen at the scene of the crime.
Yet it would be too simple to hang old Ygor.
I don't trust him!
I'm gonna find him and kick him off the estate... with your permission.
Yes.
If you like.
Amelia, you can put Peter to bed at once, but stay with him.
Yes, madam.
Inspector, I'm more terrified every minute.
Madam, I personally guarantee to get you and your son out of here in the morning.
And Wolf. He's a bundle of uncontrollable nerves and...
Yes. I'm going in now to comfort him.
Thank you.
Come in.
- Did you find Ygor?
- Yes, I got rid of him. Have a drink?
How did you get rid of him?
I killed him! He tried to murder me with his hammer, so I shot him.
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Compliment you.
For it is he who undoubtedly killed Benson.
He's dead. Murdered.
I just found his body in a secret passageway off the nursery.
Here's his watch.
It was in the possession of your son.
And here's a bit of chain that was attached to Benson's vest.
But Ygor didn't do it, nor did you.
Nor was it done by any ghost.
There's a monster afoot and you know it.
He's in your control.
By heaven, I think you're a worse fiend than your father.
Where is this monster? Where is he?
I'll stay by your side until you confess.
And if you don't,
I'll feed you to the villagers... like the Romans fed Christians to the lions.
I wouldn't put it past you.
In the meantime, will you have a drink?
Or would you like to play darts?
Amelia!
Where is Peter, Amelia? Where is he?
He's gone!
Peter!
- What is it?
- Peter's gone!
I'm going to the laboratory!
Here we are.
Peter!
Open the door!
Daddy!
Oh, baby.
Herewith I deed to you the castle and the estates of Frankenstein.
Do with them what you will.
And may happiness and peace of mind be restored to you all.
Goodbye.
- Goodbye, gentlemen.
- Goodbye, Baron.
- Goodbye, Peter.
- Goodbye, General.
Hello? Morning Dispatch.
Hello? Morning Dispatch.
Hello. Park Vista hotel?
Give me Angela Merrova's apartment.
Tell her it's Walt Garrett, Mr.
Garrett of The Morning Dispatch.
- Here's your peanuts, Wichita.
- Oh, thanks, Pinky, my boy.
- You cheapskate.
- Hey, wait a minute, what...
Hello, Miss Merrova.
It's you, Mr. Garrett. How are you?
Oh, I'm fine, thank you. How about an interview this morning?
What about?
How about your ideas on love and marriage?
Well, I have some fresh views on love, since my last trip to Europe.
Oh, I'm terribly booked up, but I might find a few minutes for you, Mr. Garrett.
All right, come right away, will you?
Goodbye, Mr. Garrett.
Say, Dooley, if a redhead calls, tell her I'm finding out about love, will you?
I'll cut you guys in if there's any new angles.
New angles? You don't know the old ones.
Say, listen, I'm gonna show you tired old hacks how to write an interview.
It's a fine thing.
You leave that door open like that, anything's liable to drop in.
Miss Merrova, your favorite newsboy is here.
- City editor.
- Hello, Andy?
Listen, Angela Merrova's dead.
Yeah, croaked. Sure, I'm sure.
Oh, this is Walt.
I don't know. There's nobody here except the monkey,
- and he couldn't have done it.
- Anybody else got it?
No, nobody knows it, not even the cops.
Let them read about it in the paper.
Yeah, yeah, give me Rewrite.
This is a horrible thing.
What'll people think, Lieutenant?
Oh, they'll probably figure out the joint's a hangout for gorillas.
- Exactly! What?
- Who's this guy?
Well, Lieutenant. Imagine finding you here, of all places.
Well, if it isn't the Kansas Sherlock.
- Which room?
- In here.
- I'll see you later, brain trust.
- Anytime I can be of service, anytime.
How do?
- Come on, come on, what is this?
- I don't know.
- The newspaper said...
- There's no dead body in here.
Oh, sit down, will you?
He's a very funny guy, this Garrett.
Well, where is it?
- Yes, where is it?
- Where's what?
The body. Of course, I just represent the law here, and if you're saving it for another one of your scoops, don't let me interfere.
Cut it out, will you,
Kincaid? What's the rib?
You tell me. There's no corpse in there.
I... No corpse?
Well, what the...
Well? Well, what gives that now?
I don't know, the body was lying right there on the floor.
It was dead. I'd take an oath.
It had a deep knife wound, right under the heart.
- Is this your idea of a joke?
- Honest at Pete it isn't, Kincaid, she was murdered.
I know! Somebody came in and swiped that body.
That's what happened, she was kidnapped.
Kidnapped?
First she was murdered, now she was kidnapped.
Oh, this is horrible.
It'll ruin the hotel.
- Positively ruin it!
- Take it easy.
- Well, genius?
- I just can't figure it out.
Well, I'll tell you, we're gonna play a new game.
Body, body, who's got the body? You want to join us?
Come on, boys.
- How you doing, Wichita?
- Not so good.
I've been in the morgue, the medical institute,
I've even had the river dragged.
There's something awful cockeyed about this whole setup.
- Any more dope on this dame?
- That's the works.
Well, it's no help. No friends, no family, an orphan.
Did you ever hear of an orphan with a family?
- File room. - Pinky, is that corn-fed wizard in there?
Yes sir. Yes sir, he's here.
- Tell him to come in right away.
- Yes, sir!
Hey, Wichita, Picklepuss wants to see you.
And he don't mean in ten minutes.
All right, all right.
Jiminy Christmas.
Darned kids.
Don't forget to try the comics section.
Hi, Walt. Say, who's that body
I seen you with last night?
- Yeah, we heard you sat up with a corpse.
- Was it a wake?
You guys are very funny, but that dead body will turn up yet.
Hello, boss. Do you want me?
- Not after today.
- Oh, well, Pinky...
- What?
- You heard me, you're through.
- I don't get it.
- You know this lady, I believe.
How do you do, Mr. Garrett?
No, I don't believe it.
I'm glad to see you recognize Miss Merrova.
But... But it isn't possible.
You must be...
Boss, this girl is a phony. I saw Angela Merrova. She's dead.
If you don't mind, she seems very much alive to me.
And it may interest you to know that she's suing the paper for $100,000.
Damage to her reputation.
And the Park Vista Hotel also is suing for a mere $50,000.
Boss, I tell you that the girl I saw in that room couldn't be alive.
- I know, she's your twin sister.
- I have no sister.
I've already extended the paper's regrets.
And I've assured Miss Merrova that we'd print a complete apology.
I thought before you left the building you also might care to apologize.
Why, certainly.
I'm very sorry for the mistake. Wait a minute.
The cashier has your check waiting for you, Garrett.
- Oh, boss, give me another chance.
- Go back to Wichita, son.
Maybe they'll give you another chance there.
No sisters.
Get out!
Calling Dr. Rhodes. Dr. Rhodes.
Calling Dr. Rhodes.
And there she was sitting in the boss's office. Alive.
Well, I almost went through the ceiling.
So I thought I'd better talk to you about it, on account of you're the only doctor friend I got.
I don't know, maybe there's something wrong with me, maybe I ought to be psyched or something.
Superintendent calling.
Dr. Rhodes speaking.
- Go into my office. I'll be right with you.
- But hurry up, will you, Mike?
Yes, sir. It's scheduled for 10:00 sharp.
Yes, we purposely postponed the operation until this morning so that Dr. Flegg could perform it.
Right, sir, we'll be ready.
Did the blood donor shown up yet, Miss Sweetman?
Not yet. Should be here any moment.
Whom did you call?
Stanley Rodgers.
Rodgers? He's in blood group one, isn't he?
- That's right.
- Is the patient group one?
That was the lab report.
That's funny. I thought she was ordinary group four.
Better call Rodgers again.
Dr. Flegg doesn't like to be kept waiting, and we must have a transfusion before we can operate.
Yes, Doctor.
Vance, look up Rodgers' number, see what's keeping him.
Yes, Miss Sweetman.
- Hello?
- Hello, Mr. Rodgers?
Jules Hospital calling.
Remember, you have an appointment this morning with Dr. Rhodes.
Gosh, what time is it?
I guess I must have forgot to set the alarm. I'll be right over.
- Sorry to have kept you, Walt.
- Oh, I know you're busy, Mike, but you don't have to treat me like the forgotten man.
I had to check up on some blood test reports.
- Go ahead, spin the rest of your yarn.
- Well, that's all there is.
The dame that was sitting in
Picklepuss' office was Angela Merrova.
There's no getting around that.
But the thing is, I can't figure it out.
- What makes you think I can help you?
- Well, this is a chest x-ray, isn't it?
- Yes.
- Well, how do you get a good look at it?
- I want to show you something.
- Pull down the blinds.
- Now what's on your mind, Walt?
- Mike,
- isn't the heart about here?
- That's right.
Did you ever hear of a person surviving with a deep knife wound about there?
Well, friend, I'd say it's impossible.
But maybe the wound wasn't as deep as you thought it was.
No, it was at least four inches.
And it was as clean as if you'd done it with your scalpel.
- Me?
- No, I don't mean you, but it did look as if it had been done by a surgeon.
And then the corpse got up and walked away, eh?
Oh, Mike...
Give me an even break, will you? I know it sounds as crazy as a loon.
You probably think I'm the one that's crazy.
But I'm on the level.
I'd take an oath.
If what you say is true, even if the heart puncture didn't kill her,
- she'd bleed to death.
- That's it.
That's what made the body look so peculiar.
I never saw a corpse that color before.
- What color?
- Absolutely dead white.
It looked as if every ounce of blood had been drained out of her body.
Extreme pallor setting in within ten minutes. I've never heard of it.
Well, you're hearing about it now.
And when I saw her in the boss' office she looked exactly as when I saw her as a corpse.
Clammy.
- Yes?
- Dr. Flegg has arrived, sir.
Thank you, I'll be right there.
I'll tell you what I'll do, Walt.
I'll speak to Dr. Flegg about it.
He's usually in a pretty decent mood before an operation.
And if anybody can give you an answer, when it comes to hematology, it's Flegg.
- Hematology?
- Yeah, the science of the blood.
Stick around awhile, will you?
I ain't got any place to go except back to Wichita.
- Don't forget to ask Flegg, now, will you?
- Right.
Thanks, Mike, I'll give you a full column write-up for this someday.
- Rodgers get here all right?
- No, Doctor, he still hasn't shown up.
What's the matter with him?
It's time for the operation.
Call his apartment again.
You won't forget to ask Dr. Flegg about it?
Yeah, yeah, I'll remember. Now go ahead and get a magazine and relax.
Walnut 43701.
I can't understand what's the matter with Rodgers.
He's never disappointed us before.
- Well?
- No.
I can try and get another donor for you.
Can't find another number one blood type as easily as that.
There are only seven people in a hundred in group one.
Notify the superintendent.
- Dr. Rhodes?
- Yes?
I was tested last week when
I first came to the hospital.
- I'm in group one.
- You're sure, Nurse?
She's right, Doctor.
Dr. Baum made the test.
I'd be willing to help if I could.
Hey, Mike, you better hurry up, Flegg's liable to walk out.
- You know him.
- Right, coming.
Take Nurse Vance to surgery and prepare for transfusion. I'll see you there.
All right, Nurse, come with me.
- Frightened?
- No.
- Ever done this before?
- No.
You'll probably be a little weak when we finish.
I won't mind.
- Everything ready?
- Yes, Dr. Flegg.
- Took you long enough.
- Sorry to have kept you waiting.
Very well.
I thought you were going to have Rodgers.
We weren't able to reach him, sir.
- Start the transfusion.
- Right.
- Fine job, Dr. Flegg.
- Yes, worked out rather neatly.
Saved that patient's life.
You're the only man that could have done it.
Interesting stuff, blood.
Make a thorough study of it, Rhodes.
It's important enough for you to devote your whole life to it.
I've been doing some research, not nearly as much as I'd like to.
Good. Stick to it.
It's going to transform the entire future of surgery.
The day is coming when man will be able to control blood.
And when that time does arrive, he'll be able to control his destiny.
Blood is the source of life.
Remember the Bible.
"And the life, which is the blood thereof. "
Hadn't you better take a look at your donor?
Oh, yes, yes sir.
- By the way, who is she?
- Girl by the name of Vance, one of the new student nurses.
- Doctor?
- Yes?
Would you say it's possible for a person to survive with a deep incision at the base of the thoracic aorta?
Why do you ask?
A friend of mine thought he knew of such a case.
Ridiculous. Tell him to change his brand of liquor.
- Oh, hello, Doctor.
- Feel a little weak?
I can take it.
I think you better rest an hour or so.
- Drink any of this?
- Not yet.
Here, take it down in one big gulp. It'll pick you up.
- What is it?
- Come on, drink it.
It's pretty swell of you to help us out.
- It's part of a nurse's education.
- That's the right spirit.
Say, why haven't I seen you before?
You never looked before.
I guess I've been missing something.
Just one more thing. I have an important operation scheduled for tomorrow evening and I'd like your assistance. Are you free?
- Yes, Doctor.
- Good.
I think you'd better wear another outfit.
Evening gown. We're going dancing.
I'd like to very much.
But, you know, we nurses...
Yes, I know, Rules for Nurses number
114, "Keep away from staff physicians. "
What's the good of rules if no one breaks them?
Well, what did Dr. Flegg have to say?
He thought you ought to be more discriminating in your choice of hooch.
Mike, cut it out, now, will you? This is serious.
- I'm out of a job.
- Dr. Rhodes.
- Yes?
- Excuse me, I have a message for you.
You're wanted at 438
Gore Street right away.
- The police called.
- The police?
- Yes, Doctor, they said it was very urgent.
- Thanks.
- What's up, Mike?
- I don't know yet.
Look me up next week when you sober up.
Oh no. Where go the police, there go I.
I'm Dr. Rhodes. The officer downstairs sent me up.
Yes, sir. Go right in.
- Dr. Rhodes.
- Come in, Doc.
- Oh, hi, Lieutenant.
- Who asked for you?
Oh, have a heart, will you, Kincaid?
A guy makes a mistake once in awhile.
- What do you got here?
- Now take it easy, big shot.
- He a friend of yours?
- Yeah.
Well, since you're an ex-reporter, I guess it's okay.
Doc, come here a minute.
You know this fellow?
That's Stanley Rodgers.
How did this happen?
Come here.
You mind telling me what this means?
Yes, simply a memorandum of an appointment he had this morning at the hospital.
- An appointment for what?
- A blood transfusion.
- He was a professional blood donor.
- Hey, Mike, come here.
Look at this guy. Look at his face and look at his body.
- Why, there's no color.
- Yeah.
That's exactly the way Merrova looked when I found her in her bedroom.
And I suppose this geezer's alive, too.
Well, I'll tell you,
Lieutenant, there's pro and con.
- Well, Doctor?
- The blood's been drained out of the body.
I know that, but where is it?
That's what I want to find out.
There's only a few stains around.
- I don't know.
- Well, maybe I can help you.
That operation at the hospital this morning. Did you perform it?
No, Dr. Flegg did. He's one of our blood specialists.
- But you do operate?
- Why, yes.
Did you take a good close look at that wound, Doctor?
Yes. Yes, I did.
The coroner tells me that man wasn't stabbed, he was operated on with a surgical instrument.
And by someone who knew how to use it.
But that's what I'm trying to tell you, just like Merrova.
Listen, rigor mortis, if you mention that Merrova dame's name again, I'II...
I know what you're thinking. A doctor did it.
- Perhaps myself.
- I'm not saying anything.
All I know is the coroner says he never saw a case just like it.
- You got the coroner's report?
- Yeah.
- You want to see it?
- Please.
The type of blood found on the stains in the carpet is group four.
Why, that's impossible, unless the murderer was wounded.
How do you figure that?
Rodgers was definitely group one.
I've used him in several transfusions. I'm sure of it.
What is this group one, group four business?
Well, you see, medical science has discovered that the human blood is divided into four different groups.
Number one being the most rare, number four the most common.
We must see to it that certain of these types are not mixed in the transfusion.
Then would you say that whoever came into Rodgers' room to kill him
- was looking for number one blood?
- It's possible.
That's why I think the coroner made a mistake in his report.
So do you mind if I make a test of these stains for myself?
No, go ahead, Doc.
One, two, four, seven, eleven.
It doesn't matter to me.
All I know is, this poor guy's number was up.
- Yes, and who done it?
- Go sit down.
If I find out anything,
Lieutenant, I'll let you know.
Yeah, do that, Doc.
And, uh, Doctor, if I were you, I wouldn't try to go away.
I mean, leave town, or anything like that.
There's one thing I definitely do know, Walt.
This is not Rodgers' blood. I checked it with his file specimen.
That's very simple. It's the murderer's, then.
Doesn't even look like human blood.
A gorilla murder. Oh, Mike.
If you can figure that one out, we'll have our front page spread on every newspaper in the United States for weeks.
I must be ready for the bug house, or something, but it doesn't even seem to be animal blood.
Well, you've got vegetable and mineral left.
It's no use. Think
I'll call it a night.
You're not giving up, are you, Mike?
No, no, this will take a long time and I'm pretty tired.
I'll take another look at it in the morning.
How'd you like to go down and mangle a few ham and eggs, before you turn in?
- No, I think I'll hit the hay.
- Okay.
If you run across any good ideas, let me know about it.
- Right.
- Good night.
- Give me a ring in the morning.
- You're on.
West 86th.
You may wait in here. Dr.
Flegg will be back any minute.
Thank you.
Looking for something?
Perhaps I can help you.
I... I was waiting for Dr. Flegg.
What is it you want?
I wanted to speak to him about a blood smear. I'm Dr. Rhodes.
Oh, Dr. Rhodes. How do you do?
My name is Quesne.
I've often heard Flegg speak of you.
- Yes?
- Yes, he thinks you show great promise.
Particularly in the study of blood composition.
That's very kind of him.
Yes, I may wish to discuss that subject with you myself someday.
I'd like to. Anytime.
Oh, he's ill.
- We're both victims of...
- Of what?
Go on, Quesne, victims of what?
Circumstance.
Go back to your work.
You wanted to see me, Rhodes?
What's the matter? Did our patient have a relapse?
No, sir, I came here to ask a favor of you.
Well, speak up, man.
What is it you want?
Your opinion on a blood specimen, as to group.
Blood group?
You must need a genius to figure that out.
Have you forgotten your hematology?
Or perhaps you never learned it.
I hate to bother you this late, Doctor, but
- there's something unusual about this.
- Unusual?
There's something I can't understand.
Oh, very well. Quesne.
Yes, sir?
Dr. Rhodes has a blood specimen I want prepared for the microscope.
At once.
Strange-looking creature, isn't he?
Yes, rather.
What is it? Terminal case of primary anemia?
No, he hasn't completely recovered from a rather severe shock.
He's been a very valuable man for me, though.
- Has he been with you a long time?
- Yes, a couple of years.
His interest in blood almost equals my own.
Let's take a look at that slide.
- Ready?
- Yes.
Where did you collect this smear, Rhodes?
At a murder this morning.
How did it happen you were called in on the case?
- To identify the body.
- Someone you knew?
Yes, a blood donor.
The man who was supposed to report to you at the hospital this morning.
Stanley Rodgers.
- Rodgers murdered?
- Yes.
Oh, that's too bad.
Blood group one, isn't he?
- Are you working with the police?
- No, sir.
Then why did you bring this to me?
The police laboratory classified it as blood group four.
I know it's not one, but I'm certain it's not four, either.
I disagree. I think the police laboratory is correct.
It is group four. Is that all?
Well, don't you notice anything peculiar about it?
Merely the usual chemical changes accompanying post-mortem coagulation.
I don't know how to explain it, but hasn't it some sort of artificial quality?
What have you done?
Clumsy fool.
Go into the office and bandage it. See that you're more careful.
- Case of hemophilia?
- No, merely a great deal of trouble.
That's the second time this week he's cut himself.
Well, I'm sorry we were interrupted.
I see no need for further discussion.
This stain is blood group four and nothing else.
Now if you'll excuse me, I've a great deal of work to do.
Could I have the slide, Doctor?
- Why, yes.
- Thank you.
You go out this way.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I had to see you.
- What's the matter?
- I feel cold.
My ears are ringing.
I can hardly breathe.
Yeah. You see, Flegg? I told you.
You'll never find what you're looking for.
- You're a failure, Flegg.
- You're lying.
- What does he mean "you're a failure"?
- Nothing.
Nothing, I assure you.
I haven't failed yet.
Now get out of here.
- Hello, Michael.
- Hiya, Walt. Glad you dropped in.
- Anything new?
- Yeah, I went over to see Flegg last night.
- Oh, what'd you find out?
- He wasn't much help.
He said the police report was right.
But as sure as I'm sitting here, he knows this bloodstain isn't ordinary group four.
Who was the fellow with the pasty face?
- How do you know about him?
- Oh, I was watching from outside.
You followed me? Why did you do that for?
Kincaid said the murder had to be committed by a doctor.
- You suspected me?
- Oh no, of course not,
- but maybe Flegg.
- Flegg? That's ridiculous.
All right, ridiculous perhaps, but possible.
Who was the other fellow?
I've seen him someplace before.
Fellow by the name of Quesne.
He's Flegg's assistant.
You know, Mike, there's something awful phony going on in that joint.
Good morning, Doctor. Come in.
- Rhodes, may I see you a moment?
- Certainly.
- Alone.
- Pardon me, I was just leaving, Doc.
How's the patient?
Excellent this morning, Doctor.
Temperature practically normal.
Last night, you asked a favor of me.
Today, I'd like to ask one of you in return.
Of course, Dr. Flegg.
Forget everything and everyone you saw at my home last night.
We'll call it professional ethics.
Yes, sir.
Oh...
What did you say that girl's name was?
The one we used yesterday for the transfusion?
Joan. Joan Vance.
- A nurse here, you said?
- Yes.
I always like to keep my list of group ones complete.
- Have you her home address?
- 1233 South Cedar.
Thank you.
Now, do you still think he's an innocent bystander?
I still don't think he's a murderer, if that's what you mean.
All right, what would you think if I told you that Angela Merrova paid him a little visit last night, and she had a blood transfusion?
Now, do you still think I'm wacky?
- You're sure it was Merrova?
- Am I sure?
Brother, there's a face I'll never forget.
And another thing I'd like to point out to you.
Did you notice the peculiar coloring on that kisser of Quesne's?
Yeah.
- Like a piece of white marble.
- Like something dead, huh?
Yeah, I remember when I shook his hand, it was cold and lifeless like a dead person's.
What do you think is the matter with him?
I don't know.
Flegg says he's suffering from a severe shock.
Well, whatever it is, Merrova has got that same cold, graveyard look.
Mike, you gotta help me out.
Every newspaperman in town is giving me the rib.
You suppose we could have a talk with Merrova?
There are a few questions
I'd like to ask her.
Well, we could try.
I'd like to ask her a couple myself.
How about tonight?
Oh, I can't make it tonight.
I've got a date with Joan.
Oh, why don't you break it?
This is no time for dames.
Walt, I can't do it.
I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll take her along.
You can drop us at the Club El Rey later.
Okay, that's a deal.
- We'll be at Merrova's at 9:00.
- Okay.
I've got a table reserved at the
Club El Rey. This won't take long.
I don't mind waiting.
616 is right down here.
Here.
Last time I was up here, she left the door open and I fell in.
I guess she left the door open again.
- Is that you, Dr. Flegg?
- No, ma'am. It's not.
What are you doing here?
What right have you to come into my apartment like this?
Now, take it easy, Miss Merrova. We just wanna have a little talk with you.
I have nothing to say to you, Mr. Garrett.
And so please get out.
That girl's always passing out.
Her hands are as cold as ice.
Is that whisky over there?
Yeah.
Here you are, Mike.
- Thank you.
- Gee, it's sure lucky we dropped in.
This is Dr. Rhodes of the Jules
Hospital. He can probably help you.
I don't need any help. I'm all right.
Besides, I expect my doctor any moment.
Well, would you mind answering a few questions before he comes?
What kind of questions?
Are you anemic?
Has Dr. Flegg been your physician for some time?
Why, yes. Several years.
- Why do you ask?
- Did he ever make a blood test of you?
You see, we're trying to find out if you are a group number one blood type.
I'm not sure, but I think so.
Why do you want to know these things?
Because we think you can help us.
Somewhere in this city, there is a murderer at large.
The only possible clue we have is that he seems to be interested in obtaining type number one blood.
Yesterday morning, a young chap named Stanley Rodgers was found murdered in his apartment.
He was type number one.
His body was completely drained of blood.
Another thing.
The knife wound was identical to that which Mr. Garrett found on you.
This is untrue.
Mr. Garrett suffers from hallucinations.
Not since I was 14.
Remember, you may be helping us to save someone else's life.
Very well.
It's true.
When you called me for an interview, as I hung up the phone, I realized someone had entered the room.
I was terrified.
A hand went over my mouth and then I felt a sharp pain on my chest.
Then I lost consciousness.
That's when I found you lying there on the floor.
- I suppose so.
- But where did you disappear to?
I don't know.
All I know is that the next morning I woke up in this room.
Why didn't you tell all of this to the police?
I didn't want this kind of publicity.
But can't you just give us a hint on who stabbed you and where he took you afterward?
I'll be all right as soon as Dr. Flegg gets here.
I'll see you tomorrow morning at 10:00 in your office.
Then I'll tell you all.
Good evening.
Dr. Flegg was out. The nurse gave me the message.
I came to see if there was anything I could do.
- How do you do, Dr. Rhodes?
- How do you do?
And...
This is Mr. Garrett.
Walt, this is Dr. Quesne.
Pleased to meet you.
Yes, how do you do, Mr. Garrett?
I'm sorry to disturb you, gentlemen, but as you can see Miss Merrova is ill.
Yeah. We were just leaving.
Yes. That's very considerate of you.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
By the way, Doctor,
I haven't forgotten that you and I are to have that talk on blood composition.
Yes, sir.
I told you I was right about that dame.
- I'm gonna go tell the boss.
- You could drop us off at the club.
Ah, no, Mike. You gotta come along.
He won't believe me.
- Success?
- You bet.
- But, Walt, I can't...
- Then we're ready to go, huh?
Well, I tell you, Joan.
Walt wanted me to drop by and see the boss...
Who does he think he is, Rip van Winkle?
- Sure this is the right house?
- Yeah, this is the place, all right.
Hey, boss.
- Hello, chief.
- You!
What's the idea of ringing my doorbell at this time of night?
What do you think this is? Halloween?
- He's always kidding.
- Kidding!
Get away from here, you...
You Wichita Frankenstein!
Now, take it easy, will you, boss?
I really got a great story for you this time. You gotta listen to me.
Come on in.
- What is it?
- I bet you can't guess where I've been.
So, now it's riddles.
Come to the point, Garrett.
I was over to see
Angela Merrova tonight.
Merrova? You blockhead!
You want her suing the paper for another $100,000?
You can forget all about that suit.
That dame really was stabbed, just like I told you. She admitted it.
- What?
- Yes, sir, and she's gonna be down at the office in the morning and give you the whole story.
Say, this isn't another one of your screwy ideas, is it?
No, boss. It's on the level. I take an oath.
This is Dr. Rhodes, a friend of mine from Jules Hospital.
Well, he was with me all the time. Tell him, Mike.
- He's right, sir.
- Well!
Could you picture that, boss, a four-column story?
"Actress to reveal truth.
"Angela Merrova tells all in the office of The Morning Dispatch. "
- Boss, I tell you, it's sensational.
- It's terrific. Come on.
Won't The Evening
Bulletin be surprised?
I'm going to make them print an apology for the apology they made us print.
- Garrett, I misjudged you.
- Yes, sir.
Hello, Andy. Hold the presses for a morning extra.
Angela Merrova is coming to my office in the morning and...
What?
- If she does, I'm not gonna be here.
- What do you mean?
I just got a flash. She's dead.
What? Are you positive about that?
Oh, I see.
All right. Thanks, Andy.
What's up, boss?
So, Angela Merrova is coming to my office in the morning and she's going to tell the whole story, huh?
- Sure, I personally guarantee it.
- Listen, wise guy.
- Merrova's dead.
- Dead?
Well, we talked to her about an hour ago.
Quesne. He killed her.
She's been murdered.
- What, again?
- Yeah.
Why, you...
Listen, phony. I don't know where you dream up these yarns of yours, but Angela Merrova was not murdered. She died of natural causes.
Now, wait a minute, boss. Maybe it's one of those up again, down again routines she's been giving us.
Maybe she ain't dead.
If she's not dead, they're playing a dirty trick on her, because they're taking her over to Bixby's Undertaking Parlors.
- Now, get out of here. Both of you.
- Yes, sir.
And don't ever come back.
I won't believe she's dead till I see it with my own eyes.
Even then I won't believe it.
- Now where to?
- The undertaker's.
Well, that's different.
The undertaker's?
We won't be a minute.
Be out in a minute, honey.
If you find someone interesting in there, send him out.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Do you have a...
A customer in here by the name of Angela Merrova?
- You mean, the body of the deceased?
- Yes.
She just came in.
- Are you gentlemen relatives?
- Not exactly.
But we sort of have an interest in her, so to speak.
Friends.
Yes, sir.
We were wondering if we could see the body.
This way, gentlemen.
Would you mind stepping in the other room with me, please?
I'd like to ask you a couple of questions.
Certainly.
We are most willing to accommodate everyone at a time like this.
- Well, tell me, Mr. Bixby...
- I'm not Mr. Bixby.
Mr. Bixby has been dead for seven years.
I'm sorry.
It's quite all right.
We all make mistakes.
About Miss Merrova in here. Could you tell me who brought her in?
My dear young man, no one brought her in.
We went and got her.
- We were called by Dr. Flegg.
- Dr. Flegg?
Did the death certificate say she died of natural causes?
I believe so.
All right, Walt.
Thank you very much, sir.
- Well, I hope to see you again sometime.
- I'm sure you will.
The old fellow said that Flegg was the one who called to pick her up.
- What did you find out?
- Merrova's death was natural, all right.
Looks like we're stumped again.
Hello. Is the big mystery solved?
No. But it's after 1:00.
I think we better go home now.
Well, don't I even get anything to eat?
Yep. We'll go over to Gus' and get you a nice, big hamburger.
Hey, Wichita, ain't you found out what you're looking for yet?
No. Give me time, will you, Pinky?
Wichita, if the boss finds out about this,
I'll be pounding the pavement with you.
You sure you're gonna put all this junk back?
Yes. Will you go back to that door and shut up?
I'm taking an awful chance with you.
But I tell you, there's nothing on a guy named Quesne.
Well, there's got to be. I've seen his puss in some paper.
You tried every file but X, Y, and Z, and here's the final batch.
- I got it.
- What?
The guy.
Dr. Maurice Xavier. Dr. X.
Hey, that's the guy that starved that little kid to death, ain't it?
Yeah, he's the skunk who wanted to find out how long babies could go without eating.
"Surgeon held in starvation slaying. "
"Dr. Xavier to face trial. "
"Dr. X dies in electric chair. "
You mean to tell me you saw that guy walking around alive?
- Yeah.
- Now I know you're bats.
Hey, what are you doing? You can't take them clippings out of here.
Pinky, will you get me the file...
Hello, chief. I mean, ex-chief.
Hey, boss, it wasn't my fault.
Honest, I told him not to.
I thought I gave orders to you never to show your ugly pan around here again.
I knew you didn't mean it.
Well, this time you're going to regret knowing so much.
Now, wait a minute.
Get me the circulation department.
Tell them to send a couple of boosters up here.
I want this Wichita brainchild exterminated.
Now, wait a minute, boss. I've got a story that's going to crack the front page of every newspaper in America.
When you read it, you're gonna give me my job back.
- What do you have behind your back?
- Nothing. Nothing.
- Well.
- Circulations.
But it can't be.
This Dr. X was electrocuted.
Unless the execution didn't take place.
Oh, but it did. I phoned the warden and made sure.
Dr. Flegg came out and claimed the body, and the burial took place in Greenlawn Cemetery.
But, Walt, that's impossible.
Okay. Let's go out to the cemetery and find out tonight.
All right.
- I'll pick you up right after dinner.
- Okay.
How are we going to get into Xavier's grave?
It's against the law, you know.
I know the old caretaker in here. Leave it to me.
Well, sir, here we are.
Yep. That's it.
Well, let's start, eh?
Yeah.
Boy, I never heard nails sound like that before.
Well? What did I tell you? Empty.
I've been robbed.
No. There wasn't ever anything in that coffin to rob.
Well, let's go, Mike.
Thanks, Pop. Put it back, will you?
I'd like to hear what your friend,
Dr. Flegg, has to say about this.
At least we can give him a chance to explain.
It's true.
I'd hoped to keep it a secret until I'd completed my experiments.
There's no use in my denying it any longer.
Quesne and Dr. Xavier are one and the same.
Do you mean to tell us that you have discovered a way to bring a man back to life?
Yes.
- It's incredible.
- Is it?
Remember, a hundred years ago, anesthesia would have seemed equally incredible.
Even 50 years back, the possibility of x-ray would have astounded the world.
Twenty years ago, would anyone have believed that the living, pulsing human heart could be held in a surgeon's hand, operated on, and the patient walk again?
- But to revive a dead man.
- Yeah, I don't believe it.
You've told no one about your visit to the cemetery?
No, sir.
Then come with me.
After you, gentlemen.
You're fortunate. I had this equipment set up this afternoon for some additional experimentation.
This animal died this morning.
Double glioma.
Please satisfy yourself that he's quite dead.
Yeah.
He's dead, all right.
Too much emotion in your make-up, Garrett.
You never would have made a good surgeon.
An objective surgeon can't afford the luxury of feelings.
Yes, sir.
Well, Rhodes?
No question about it.
Rigor mortis has set in.
We'll now prepare the blood for decoagulation.
In Quesne's case, the electric chair made this step unnecessary.
His body was already prepared.
Now, if you gentlemen will step to the other side of that table, please.
This is ordinary rabbit blood, taken from the animal immediately after they die.
Rhodes, will you...
This is a special formula, my own composition.
The compound ester, in which essential blood salts have been precipitated.
Naturally, Quesne received a considerably larger dose.
And now are you satisfied?
That's good enough for me.
It's remarkable, Dr. Flegg.
Needless to say, it took a much greater period to revive Dr. X, but the procedure was essentially the same.
As you know,
I claimed the body and pretended to bury it in Greenlawn Cemetery.
But immediately after the execution,
I brought it here to the laboratory.
Suffice it to say that after six hours of the most intense work, his heart began to beat.
And in another hour, he opened his eyes and spoke to me.
Well, what I want to know is, why did you bring Xavier back to life?
He was a convicted murderer.
True, in the eyes of society, he was a murderer.
But he was also a medical genius.
And I felt that he had been a martyr to science.
Was that the only reason?
No. Not quite.
In addition to the experiments of the type you have just seen,
I needed him for further research.
Gentlemen, shall we go back to my office?
Well, gentlemen, if that's all, it's late. I'm getting a little tired...
One more thing I'd like to ask you, Doctor.
Could you revive anybody, no matter how they died?
Yes, I believe I could.
Then maybe you brought
Angela Merrova back to life.
Miss Merrova was a patient of mine, yes.
And maybe you know who killed her, too, huh?
I had nothing to do with that.
I'm interested in saving life, not in destroying it.
These further experiments you mentioned, what are they, Dr. Flegg?
Rhodes, surely you can understand.
After we've recreated life, the second and greater problem is to sustain it.
In order to do that, we must be able to give the person a new bloodstream.
For six years in that laboratory,
I've been striving to create a usable, workable, synthetic blood.
Synthetic blood?
That's the blood I found in Merrova's body.
That artificial quality was your synthetic blood.
And those phony stains in Rodgers' apartment.
Yes.
But why did she die, if you've created a synthetic blood?
But I haven't, Rhodes.
It's true that my formula will sustain life for a short period.
But unlike human blood, it fails to recreate itself.
Somehow, somewhere, the magic element of life has eluded me.
How is it that that Quesne manages to keep alive?
- Why I...
- I'll tell you how.
By killing for human blood.
Yes, but he had to.
He warned me. Told me he was dying.
Begged me to help him, but I refused.
Then I realized that my work had ended not in failure but in disaster.
Angela Merrova had been murdered.
Quesne saw her here in my office and knew that she was number one blood type.
The type he needed.
She was his first victim.
When I discovered what had happened,
I brought her back to life.
But I knew it was only for a short period.
Her death was inevitable.
Dr. Flegg, you knew this all the time and you didn't say anything to the police about it?
I wanted to.
But I was hoping every hour, every minute that I'd find the secret.
Thousands of lives could be saved if I could perfect my formula.
That's all over now.
Quesne will continue to kill until he's destroyed.
My experiments have turned into madness.
I've created a monster.
May God forgive me.
I'm sorry, Dr. Flegg.
There's no time to be sorry.
We've got to tell the police and I've got to get to my paper.
Goodbye, Dr. Flegg.
Mike, nothing like this has ever happened before.
It's the greatest story
I've ever had in my life.
- Hey. Hold on. Not so fast.
- Roy.
Gee, it's lucky we ran into you.
Yeah, lucky for me. I've been looking all over town for you two guys.
Cuff them, Moran.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
We haven't done anything.
No? What were you doing at
Greenlawn Cemetery tonight?
- We can explain that.
- Not to me you can't.
Snatching bodies is against the law.
Now, hold on minute, will you, Roy?
We got the answers to those murders. Now, listen...
Flegg.
You told them about me.
Yes.
In a few minutes, the police will be looking all over the city for you.
You might as well give yourself up.
No, you gave me this life and I'm going to keep it as long as I can.
I want that list of blood donors.
The addresses in that book of yours.
I won't give them to you.
Dr. Flegg?
Quesne.
The book.
He's got the book of addresses.
What's he talking about, Mike?
The list of blood donors. Joan's name's in that book and Quesne got it now.
Moran, you call an ambulance. Stay here and take charge of things.
- Come on, Roy. We need your help.
- All right.
Boys, you can get in my car.
- Paper.
- Miss Vance.
Yes?
My name is Quesne.
Dr. Rhodes was called to Dr. Flegg's home.
He asked me to meet you and bring you there.
- Thank you.
- I have a cab waiting.
It's all right.
Come on, come on, Lieutenant.
Can't you go any faster?
I thought Dr. Flegg lived on 86th Street.
He moved last week. Sutton Place.
Extra. Extra.
Say, buddy. Did you see Miss Vance tonight?
Yeah. Not more than a half hour ago.
A guy stopped her and talked to her and they got into
Shorty's cab and drove off.
- Was it a pasty-faced guy?
- Yeah, a funny looking mug.
You have any idea where they went?
Before the girl come, I heard him say to Shorty
- something about going to Jersey.
- Jersey?
Catch a gander at that.
That's an old duck club, just outside of Newark, the place where he starved that baby to death.
It all ties up, Mike.
Come on. Let's go.
Shouldn't we have turned there for Sutton Place?
I presume the driver knows a shorter way.
Really, there's no need for alarm.
No.
Of course not.
Come on now, will you, Roy?
You're not taking me to Dr. Flegg's.
That's quite right.
Dr. Rhodes didn't send you, either.
- On the contrary...
- You're lying.
Let me out of here.
Is this okay, boss?
Yes. This will do nicely.
- Looks like we walk from here.
- All right, let's go.
I wouldn't scream.
No one can hear you.
I'll take care of
Joan. Get after Xavier.
Ready, men?
Tell Dr. Rhodes we'll have to postpone our talk on blood composition.
But think what you're giving up.
You've got the makings of a great newspaperman in you.
And if you stick with me, you'll go places.
I'll give you a daily column to do.
You'll see your name in print 365 days in the year.
I'm having your contract drawn up now.
Say, how do you like that pipe?
Yeah, yeah. It's fine. But what about the contract? Will you sign it?
No, boss. I've got my novel to do.
I wanna get back.
Back to Wichita, where I can get close to the soil.
Well, I guess there's no use trying to keep you here.
But I'm disappointed in you,
Garrett. Terribly disappointed.
But no hard feelings.
Well, gee, I'm glad you feel that way about it, boss.
If you're ever around Wichita sometime
I hope you'll drop in and say hello.
- Here's the contract for Mr. Garrett.
- Thanks.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Well, hello.
- I don't think we'll be needing this.
Mr. Garrett has definitely decided to leave us.
Oh, really?
Oh, I'm awfully sorry you aren't going to be with us, Mr. Garrett.
Are you?
- That will be all, Miss Lawrence.
- Yes, sir.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Who was that?
- My new secretary.
Yes, I'm deeply disappointed in you.
- Any ink in that?
- There is today.
My boy, you'll never regret this. No, sir.
Okay, boss. I'll see you later.
English
Order.
Order in the court.
This court will recess for 15 minutes.
That Martin's as good as acquitted.
That judge wants to watch his step of the Loder crowd.
They're bad babies to play with.
Hey, lady, I bet you 5-to-2 that Judge Shaw lets Martin go.
- Scram.
- Oh, wait a minute.
Aw, skip it.
I'll bet you 10-to-1 that Judge Shaw lets Martin go free.
- Make it 100-to-1 and I'll take it.
- Oh, professional guy, huh?
Boy, this is a fine thing.
Here's a guy who walks into City Treasury, grabs himself 350,000 bucks...
...and there isn't a judge in town to give him the rap he deserves.
- What are you nervous about, Martin?
- I'm not nervous.
What's that on your forehead, dew?
If it were any other judge,
I wouldn't be worrying.
- I'm not worrying.
- Well, you're not on trial.
Stop looking guilty.
No judge will send you up, not even Shaw.
Yes, you can set up an acquittal headline, and if it isn't used, I'll pay for it.
Rewrite it, sweetheart. This is a feature.
I'll give you the lead as soon as
Judge Shaw comes out of conference.
Roger, you can't go through with this.
There was another telephone call a half hour ago.
A man said if you convict Martin, that they'II...
Roger, I'm afraid.
I've been threatened time and again.
It's the oldest trick in the world.
But don't you see,
I've got to do my duty.
Isn't your duty to your children and to me just as important as your duty to the state?
Roger, I'm afraid.
I wish I was as sure as you are.
What's he calling recess for?
- Oh, stop being a fool.
- What's the matter with you?
He's got the jitters.
You'd think he was on trial.
- Yeah, he's the sensitive type.
- Well, I'm not at all sure.
- Well, you will be.
- Say, I'll bet you...
- I didn't know it was you, boss. I'm sorry.
- Well, what's your bet?
Bet you 10-to-1 Judge Shaw gives Martin the keys to the city.
If you need money that bad,
I'll take you for 50.
- Fifty?
- Yes, 50-to-500. You made a bet, kid.
Yeah.
Order.
Order in the court.
This honorable court is now in session.
Dinner at my house at 8.
We'll celebrate.
The defendant stand up.
Stephen Martin, this court finds you guilty.
Guilty of the charge of diverting public funds from the City Treasury...
...and the misappropriation of said funds as mentioned in the indictment.
It's the judgment of this court...
...that you be imprisoned in the penitentiary for a period of 10 years.
And furthermore, this court recommends that no application for parole be considered.
I can only add that it's the public's misfortune...
...that the law under which you were convicted doesn't carry a heavier penalty.
The court's adjourned.
This court's adjourned.
And I thought I bet on a sure thing.
Aw.
Ha-ha-ha.
Heh, a straight shot and I missed it.
You always miss the straight ones, Nolan.
Your play, Loder.
This isn't the sort of celebration
I had planned for poor Martin.
Don't waste too much sympathy on Martin.
The only thing that's good about him, he can keep his mouth shut.
Sentenced to 10 years in the State Penitentiary.
- It's a long time.
- What are you jumpy about?
Look here, we've gotta do something.
Even if he keeps quiet, we're still mixed up.
Judge Shaw and his DA are on the warpath.
He'll get us all.
Relax, Merritt, relax.
The DA and his office doesn't worry us.
I'll agree that Judge Shaw is a serious menace to our organization...
...but Mr. Loder and I have, uh, decided to give him attention.
I don't get you.
Why do you think we're playing pool with young Trigger?
Yeah, come on, Trigger, take a shot.
Dig for your dimes, boys.
- This is where I do my stuff.
- What do you mean?
Figure it out.
Take a look at this shot.
Nice shot, Trigger.
Now, if you can just drop
Judge Shaw that easy.
What? You're not going to murder him.
- You get it.
- We can't do that.
Sure we can. I never miss.
That's a pay ball, gentlemen.
Dime, please.
- It will be easy for the DA to trace it to us.
- I can assure you it won't.
Murder, as Trigger will tell you, is a very fine art.
- Covering up afterwards is even finer.
- Shaw is a hero right now.
The public is never going to stand for another unsolved murder.
- They'll demand...
- Quite right.
They'll demand a solution and a closed case and we'll give it to them.
I have a splendid solution.
John Ellman, fresh out of prison, sent there by Judge Shaw.
- Are you sure it'll work out all right?
- Positive.
I'll make it doubly sure by personally defending him for Shaw's murder.
- Make the best speech of my career.
- And lose the case.
What name shall I communicate to Mr. Loder?
Tell him, uh...
Tell him it's something personal.
- Very well, I'll tell Mr. Loder.
- Thank you.
But I do not think he will look up on you.
Excuse me, sir.
A nameless person to see you, sir.
- Shall I inform him to remove himself?
- No. Tell him to wait.
Thank you, sir.
Trigger, time you got going.
- Skip out the back way.
- Okay.
- Why are you bringing him here?
- He thinks I'm gonna help him.
He'll be a cinch for the job that Trigger's got for him.
- I'm Loder, did you wanna see me?
- Yes, sir.
My name is John Ellman.
A man told me to come and see you.
He said you're always ready to help a fellow.
Ellman, eh? Oh, yeah, I remember.
Judge Shaw sent you up for second-degree murder.
Yes, for 10 years.
- Some woman in the case, wasn't there?
- It was my wife.
- I struck a man, I didn't mean to kill him.
- Sure, sure.
- Well, what can I do for you?
- I want a job, Mr. Loder.
I'm a musician, and a good one too.
Look, I'Il... I'll show you.
That's fine.
I said, that's fine. Cut it out.
Why, you don't look like you could hold a job if you got one.
You ought to go away somewhere, get a fresh start.
I know, but I haven't any money.
- If you could lend me some?...
- You guys are all alike.
I can pay it back just as soon as I get a job.
- Sure, that's what they all say.
- But they said you'd help me.
Sako, get him out of here.
This way.
Got a light, buddy?
Hmm. Thanks very much.
Kind of tough running out of matches.
Say, I remember your face.
Name's on the tip of my tongue.
Aren't you John Ellman, the fellow they railroaded to prison?
Yes.
Wait a minute, buddy.
I knew I'd seen you someplace before.
John Ellman. Huh.
- How are things going for you?
- Not so good.
It's tough going after a stretch, isn't it?
How long you been out?
- Two weeks.
- Say, you look kind of cold.
How about coffee to warm you up, huh?
- Sure.
- Draw two, Mike.
Yes, sir, two cups of coffee.
That's right.
If you're having tough luck,
I may be able to help you out.
That's very kind of you.
- Could you use a good job?
- Well, what sort of a job?
Oh, it's on the up-and-up.
Sort of detective work.
I need a man to watch the house of Judge Roger Shaw.
Judge Shaw?
- Why, he's the man who sent me to prison.
- He did?
- Well, ha, ha, isn't this a small world?
- Well, just what would I have to do?
He's been playing around a little and his wife wants some evidence.
- I've got to get a man to watch his house.
- Oh, I don't think I could do that.
All you've got to do is watch his house.
Take notes as to when he arrives, and when he leaves.
Now, there's nothing wrong in that, is there?
- Well, no, I guess not.
- That's the stuff.
Imagine, Dr. Beaumont keeping this heart pumping for over two weeks.
I wish he'd do something about making your heart pump.
Don't be funny.
Jimmy, how many more years of payments before this ring is really ours?
- Only a few. Is this sterilized?
- Yes. Only a few?
At the rate you're going, it will probably be 20.
It may not be more that 18.
Oh, ha, ha, Jimmy.
- Are we going out tonight?
- Yes, if I can get away.
He can't keep you.
He's lecturing at the institute.
Tell him you're taking me out.
There he is now.
Jimmy?
- Do you love me?
- Yes, of course. Why?
Why don't you say so sometimes?
That's saying it.
- Here's the solution, doctor.
- Huh?
Oh, thank you.
Pretty girl, Nancy.
Very pretty.
- Thinking of getting married?
- Why, yes, we'd like to.
You're not making much money.
That doesn't matter.
We both like working for you.
- We get along.
- Hmm.
Well, in a few years, you'll be doing big things, Jimmy.
You have a natural feeling for this work...
...but it will demand all of your time and thought.
I'm afraid marriage will interfere with your progress.
Do you think you can postpone it?
We're pretty much used to waiting by now.
You're supposed to be at the institute at 8, doctor.
Huh?
Your lecture.
Oh, ah, yes, yes, yes. Thank you.
Well, how about it, Jimmy?
Do you think you can wait?
- I'm afraid I'll have to, doctor.
- Well, if you do...
...you're a bigger fool than I thought you were. Good night.
- Hey!
- Jimmy, are you hurt?
Uh, they smacked the left side of the car.
I'm gonna get that guy.
Bust my fenders. They can't get away with that hit-and-run stuff.
- Not so fast, Jimmy.
- Oh, it's just my luck.
My insurance ran out yesterday.
Wait. Look.
- Did you get their license number?
- No, they were too far ahead.
Oh, Jimmy, let's go. I'm afraid.
Looks like somebody's been taken for a ride.
Jimmy, we don't wanna get mixed up in a thing like this.
Oh, Jimmy.
Listen, you two, you haven't heard or seen a thing.
Keep your trap shut, understand?
Now beat it.
"Judge Shaw. " Holy smoke!
- It's a lie, a lie. I tell you, I didn't do it.
- Order in the court. Order.
Proceed.
Don't worry.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, these facts cannot be denied.
The accused rented the car.
Night after night, he was seen skulking around the deceased's home.
Ten years ago, Judge Roger Shaw did his duty as he saw it...
...and sentenced this man to prison for an offense...
...the details of which, out of fairness to the accused...
...I shall not relate.
Today, this man takes vengeance into his own hands and kills.
If you acquit him, you jeopardize our entire social life...
...our entire legal system.
Morally, you can not acquit.
Morally and legally, you must convict.
The defense's only alibi...
...of a man and woman who could step forward, by waving a magic wand...
...absolve the accused of all guilt, is so fantastic...
...that I shall not presume upon your valuable time by refuting it.
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
...the state asks that you find John Ellman guilty of murder in the first degree.
The state rests.
I can't stand it. I tell you, I can't stand it.
We can't be quiet about this.
- We've got to tell.
- Jimmy, please? Let's get out of here.
Come. Come. Pardon me.
- Hey, buddy?
- Yeah?
- I'll bet you 2-to-1 he's acquitted.
- You're on.
It's a bet, and if I don't win this time...
...I'm gonna go back on relief.
- Yeah.
- This is no ordinary murder trial.
- I don't care.
You can't get mixed up in a thing like this.
It'll ruin your career.
Why, they won't stop with threats.
They'll kill you.
Jim, I love you too much.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
...the greatest fault my client possesses is his firm belief in his fellow men.
He believes, even now...
...that the young couple who have the power to free him will step forward.
We admit the sedan.
We admit the fingerprints on the steering wheel.
We admit the prisoner's record.
We even admit that the notes in this book were written by the defendant.
In fact, we deny nothing but the charge.
Order in the court.
I thought Nolan was defending this bird.
He's pushing the electric chair right under him.
We only ask you to try, ladies and gentlemen...
...try and realize that an unjustly accused man sits in this court.
Sits waiting, not in vain, I pray, for the young couple to step forward...
...and say the words that will definitely establish his innocence.
Never mind, son.
Is that you, warden? Is there any news?
Is there any news, warden?
Tell me, tell me, please.
Am I pardoned?
The governor refuses to intervene.
But those two witnesses.
They know I didn't do it.
Why can't they find them?
Why don't they speak?
They have done everything that can possibly be done.
Let me ask you this, Ellman.
Do you suspect anyone of framing you?
Who'd want to frame me?
Have you any enemies, anyone who might feel, uh?
No. I have no enemies.
We always come back to this point, then, Ellman. It seems inevitable.
But you can't kill me for something that I didn't do.
You can't, I tell you, you can't.
I don't want to die. I want to live.
Well, Ellman, it's within my power to grant any last request you care to make.
You take away my life and offer me a favor in return.
That's what I call a bargain.
Anything you want, within reason.
Anything I want.
I'll give you something easy, warden.
I'd like music.
Have you anyone here who can play a violin or a cello?
Yes.
I'd like him to play my favorite piece as I walk out there.
It'll make it easier.
Is that such a strange request, warden?
I always think of heaven like that.
We were the witnesses that night.
He had nothing to do with the murder.
- How do you know?
- We saw two men drag the body...
...into Ellman's car.
He didn't kill Judge Shaw.
- That's very strange.
- Doctor, you've got to do something.
- You keep looking at your watch. Date?
- Oh, lay off, Nolan.
You know what's the matter.
- I won't feel safe until the man's dead.
- Oh, forget it.
There's a Dr. Beaumont insists on talking to you, sir.
- Dr. Beaumont?
- Yes, sir.
Hello, doctor?
Yes?
Why, I'd be glad to see you.
What?
John Ellman?
What is this, Nolan, a rib?
- Yes?
- I called you as Ellman's attorney.
I tell you,
I have those two witnesses here.
They can absolutely prove
Ellman's innocence.
Oh, Nolan, there isn't a minute to lose.
You must get in touch with the governor.
I can't get in touch with the governor direct.
I'll have to work through the DA's office. Yes.
You hold the witnesses there until I get the DA over.
I'll bring him over if it's humanly possible.
- Yes. All right, doctor. Goodbye.
- What is it? What's happened?
- Those two kids have shown up and talked.
- I knew it.
- I thought you knew the art of covering up.
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't like to be hurried.
- We can't ignore this. It's too dangerous.
At the right time, I'll get in touch with Werner. Then it'll be too late.
In the meantime, let's finish our supper, hmm?
- Step on it. Can't you drive any faster?
- I'm doing the best I can, boss.
I'll bet you 2-to-1 that I'll beat this next stop sign.
- Is the man crazy?
- Traffic light.
Don't stop, fool. There's no traffic.
Even if there was, this is no time to stop.
- You tell me to respect the law, and now...
- Shut up and get going.
They should've been here an hour ago.
Nancy, please.
I don't like the looks of this whole business.
If these two witnesses turn out to be phonies, I warn you...
Can't you forget for once that you're a prosecuting attorney?
It's an innocent man's life at stake.
Ain't you ever gonna get that box tuned?
I still got half an hour.
The man who asked for this is a musician.
It's gotta be done right.
- Okay, I'll tell you when it's time.
- You no have to tell me. I'll know.
- Ah.
- How do you do?
How do you do?
- This is Mr. Werner.
- How do you do?
- These are the witnesses.
How do you do?
May I ask you a few questions?
No, they haven't time for their story.
It's five minutes to 12.
Get the governor, will you? Hurry.
I tried it, but he wouldn't talk to me.
Long distance. Quickly.
It's time, Ellman.
This is District Attorney Werner.
Get me the executive mansion at once.
It's a matter of life and death.
I'll be seeing you.
Keep your chin up.
Show them you can take it, pal.
He'll believe me.
The best pitcher we got on our team goes out on parole tomorrow.
- Tough luck losing a good man.
- What are you worrying about?
Carr Smith the shortstop's coming in here pretty soon.
- He's swell. He'd make our team.
- Well, he's due in about a week.
Got himself in a jam.
He's gonna be here about five years.
Hmm, that's good news.
Warden's office.
Yep?
Yes, sir.
Ellman?
It's... It's too late, governor.
They just gave him the first jolt.
I'll try. Yes, sir.
Yes?
Werner speaking.
Ellman is dead.
Werner, get the governor back.
- Tell him to call off the autopsy.
- Why?
Never mind why. Don't ask questions, there's no time to lose. Call him.
Raise the BP three degrees.
Jimmy, it's impossible.
He was electrocuted.
Increase the oxygen.
If Dr. Beaumont doesn't succeed,
I'll never forgive myself.
Steady, Nancy.
Keep that Lindbergh heart pulsating, Nancy.
See that it doesn't stop.
Prepare the respirator.
He's alive.
He will live.
This concludes America's part in the great international broadcast...
...in honor of the modern miracle performed by Dr. Evan Beaumont.
All right, England. Take it away.
And we of the medical and scientific fields in England pay respect to Dr. Beaumont...
...for the most incredible achievement in the history of medical science.
Now, please, try to remember.
Don't you know your name?
- Uh, name.
- Yes, ye...
Well, do you remember that I brought you back to life?
- Life.
- Yes.
You were in another world.
Do you recall anything of that world before you came back?
I don't know.
Oh, but try to understand.
Please, you must.
You...
This is District Attorney Werner, the man who sent you to the electric chair.
- Chair.
- Yes.
Look at me, Ellman.
Don't you remember me?
I prosecuted you in court.
Do you feel that I'm your enemy?
No.
He sent you to the electric chair for the murder of Judge Shaw. You remember that?
Can't you remember anything that happened before you died?
Please.
Please.
You see, except for this blood clot,
Ellman is apparently sound.
- Is that why he doesn't remember?
- I believe so.
Well, why don't you operate?
Too great a risk. Ellman isn't normal.
Werner, there are times when I feel that man knows everything.
Doctor, when he looked at me...
...and denied me as an enemy,
I felt that too.
- Did you?
- It's uncanny.
- Hmm.
- How do you account for it?
I can't yet.
All I know is that for a short time, the spirit of life left his body.
Now, what happened during that transition?
What effect did the experience of death have on his subconscious mind?
- Can he remember?
- Well, that's rather a large order, doctor...
...and I'm afraid a bit beyond the province of law.
And beyond the province of science too.
But it's a challenge.
And somewhere,
I feel we'll find the key to all this.
If you do, I hope you let me know.
Why, John, you shouldn't have left your...
Oh, please, let me help you...
- Hello, Dr. Beaumont.
- Hello.
I want you to know that the state has appointed me Ellman's guardian.
- And they've awarded him $500,000.
- Well, that's a fortune.
Though I doubt if any suffering can be measured in dollars.
A half a million?
At that rate, I'd be willing to die a little bit myself, ha, ha.
Well, you've worked very hard for him, Mr. Nolan.
And although he can't express it,
I know that he's very grateful to you.
- Dr. Beaumont.
- Yes.
Ellman. Come quickly, please.
John.
Get out.
- Get out.
- What is it, John? What's the matter?
- Get out.
- The man's insane.
I think you better wait in my office.
You're disturbing him.
Very well.
John, what is the matter?
Mr. Nolan's done everything he could.
Because of his efforts, the state's awarding you half a million dollars.
He's the best friend you have.
No, he's my enemy.
Why do you say that?
Eh?
Why do you say Nolan is your enemy?
Tell me.
- I don't know.
- But...
Doctor, a little later, please.
Yes. Take him to his room.
John.
Is he all right?
I wonder what made him act in that way towards you, Mr. Nolan.
I don't know. You're a doctor.
Maybe you can figure it out.
I wish I could.
He seems to be driven by strange impulses.
As if he were the instrument of some supernatural power.
Or why should he show this hatred towards Nolan...
...who is his friend?
You know, doctor,
I don't believe Nolan ever was his friend.
But he defended him.
The state even appointed him
Ellman's guardian.
It's the work of racketeers who have everything in the city under their control.
- And Nolan is the brains of that group.
- No.
I'm convinced they framed Ellman for the killing of Judge Shaw.
You threw a wrench into their machinery when you brought him back.
Well, I haven't the slightest doubt...
...that even though before death
Ellman knew nothing...
...he knows something now.
If he does, he knows things of great importance to me.
Hmm. Do you know the rest of these racketeers?
Oh, yes, very well.
Socially and professionally.
Werner, I'm going to invite my board of trustees...
...and some distinguished doctors and scientists to meet Ellman.
I'd like to try something, and I want your help.
What have you in mind, doctor?
Well, if Ellman shows antagonism towards Nolan, without apparent cause...
...would he react in the same way to?...
Mr. Merritt.
How do you do?
- Mr. Blackstone.
- Glad to know you, doctor.
Mr. Loder.
How are you?
Mr. Nolan you know.
Of course.
- Glad you could come.
- Thank you.
- I hope we're not late.
You're just in time.
That's just fine.
We hate to miss anything.
I hope you won't.
My secretary will show you where to sit.
- This way.
- Thank you.
Not at all. Delighted. Only too happy.
Here you are, Mr. Nolan.
And you sit here, Mr. Blackstone.
And you sit here, gentlemen.
I still don't see why we had to come here.
Good thing we had drinks before we got here.
He certainly has devoted the last 20 years to his experiments.
He really deserves success.
Jimmy, thank you for the flowers.
They're lovely.
- That's all right.
- Well, you don't seem very cheerful tonight.
- I'm worried about you.
- Why?
You've been working so hard on this case that we'll have to take care of you soon.
Jimmy, don't you understand?
I feel I must do everything
I possibly can for him.
You're wearing yourself down.
You can't go on like this.
This means everything in the world to Dr. Beaumont.
- It should mean everything to us.
- It should, but Dr. Beaumont is changed.
He's forgotten everything we started out to do.
All he thinks of is trying to find out what Ellman experienced while dead.
- Trying to put his soul under a microscope.
- Beaumont is doing what he thinks is best.
But in the meantime, we're growing apart.
We don't seem to belong to each other anymore.
Every time I try to see you, it's always Ellman, Ellman, Ellman.
- That man seems to have you hypnotized.
- You shouldn't say that.
I'll say what I please when it concerns us.
If Dr. Beaumont doesn't come back to earth soon...
...I'm gonna get a self-respecting job on the back of an ambulance.
Oh, Dr. Beaumont is ready for us, John.
- Hello, Jimmy.
- Hello, John.
I'll see you later, Jimmy.
I'll be waiting inside. There.
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I would like you to meet Mr. Ellman.
But rather than embarrass him...
...by putting him on exhibition as the man who returned from the dead...
...I prefer to present him to you as a pianist...
...if that will meet with your approval.
Thank you.
All right, Nancy.
I can't stand that man's eyes.
He looked as though he were strapping me to a hot seat.
- He got me that way too.
- Listen...
...I won't feel safe till he's sent back where he came from.
Get hold of Trigger.
What's the matter? Go on back in there.
- I'm not going back.
- Neither am I.
- I'm gonna put Trigger on that ghost.
- What you wanna do, gum up the works?
With the eyes of the world on Ellman?
Fat chance.
We gotta do something.
This is one of Werner's tricks.
He's gonna get all of us.
That's a lot of baloney.
Do you think for a minute that?...
Don't you appreciate music?
Why, sure we do, when it's good.
Gentlemen, your conduct here tonight...
- ...has betrayed you.
- Of what?
If I'm not too inquisitive, of sending Ellman to the electric chair...
...on a murder charge for which all of you were responsible.
- Where did you get that fantastic idea?
- It's more than an idea, Nolan.
It seems to me you're getting a little careless with your talk.
Remember, I'm Ellman's attorney.
That was the most unfortunate thing that ever happened to him.
You're a smart man, Werner.
What's the matter?
Has Dr. Beaumont's supernatural hocus-pocus gotten you too?
No, it isn't hocus-pocus.
I don't need the aid of the supernatural to read the guilt written all over your faces.
It's elemental, my dear Nolan. Elemental.
Why, look at Mr. Merritt's face.
It's an open book.
Oh, he looks like that all the time.
Well, boys, enjoy yourselves.
Go on, get hold of Trigger, and don't lose any time.
- Maybe you're right.
- What? You all gone crazy?
What are you so panicky about?
Werner hasn't got a thing on us.
The trouble is you all have a guilty conscience.
I haven't.
Now, keep calm and nothing is going to happen.
- I'm going to make sure nothing happens.
- Wait.
- Go ahead. We got nothing to lose.
- Leave it to me.
Yeah?
Yeah, you can talk.
Listen, Trigger, I got a big order for you.
And here's the lowdown.
Ellman? Huh, you don't want much, do you?
Can't you get somebody else?
How do you expect me to get near him?
Well, it's worth double the usual rate.
What?
I said triple the usual rate, and money in advance.
I'll be at your place in half an hour.
Where'd you come from?
Funny, ha, ha.
You and me always seem to be meeting up at the right time.
Here I've been thinking of paying you a visit and, heh...
...you save me the trouble by walking in.
Sit down. Make yourself at home.
Keep it. That's all.
How did you know where to find me?
Why did you kill Judge Shaw?
Lay off that stuff.
I never even seen the judge.
That night, I thought you were my friend.
- You took my life.
- Well, I'm gonna take it again.
Unless you got cat blood, no one's gonna bring you back. Put them up.
You can't kill me again.
Keep away from me, I tell you, or I'll plug you.
- You can't use that gun.
- Keep back. Keep back.
- You can't escape what you've done.
- Stay where you are, I say. Keep back.
Trigger.
What?
Trigger.
That you, Nolan?
Trigger Smith is dead.
- What?
- What's the matter?
Trigger Smith is dead.
I tell you,
I found him lying dead on the floor.
This is no rib, Nolan.
If you ask me, Ellman had a hand in it.
He'll get all of us.
What? Have you gone crazy?
Come over here and have a drink.
Not me. I'm taking no chances.
I'm leaving town tonight.
- Thank you.
- That's all.
Blackstone.
Why...
Why, how did you know I was here?
Why did you have me killed?
Why, I... I...
You're mad. He's mad.
Wait.
"R.I.P." What does that mean?
"- Rest in peace. "
- Good idea, we'll use it.
This is proper. You will find it to your liking for an occasion like this.
It isn't large enough.
Send a big wreath of white chrysanthemums.
- Trigger would like that.
- Sunset Hour Funeral Parlors, Trigger Smith.
- May I have your card?
- That won't be necessary. No name.
Just make it flashy.
We don't care about the price.
Give us something that will knock the mourners' eyes out.
- Mm-hm.
- I understand. Just a moment.
I hope Trigger Smith appreciates this.
- Hello.
- Hello, Merritt.
- Listen.
- What's the matter?
- The DA phoned.
- What is it?
- It's Blackstone.
- What's the matter?
- He was killed last night.
- Killed?
I'm sure Ellman drove him mad.
- That man has supernatural...
- Stop talking like a madman.
You may think I'm crazy, but he's going to get us.
- Shut up.
- Here we are, sir.
- How you like this?
- That looks very good.
Say, that's great.
But you better make it two instead of one.
Huh?
Joe. Hey, Joe.
Where are you? Joe.
- Here we are.
- Where have you been?
Your orders were to stay outside this door.
- There's funny things going on.
- What?
We've been seeing and hearing things around here and there ain't nothing.
Yellow, huh? Fine guards I've got.
- We ain't afraid of nothing alive.
- What's the matter?
- We ain't no use to you, and we're leaving.
- You can't. I won't sleep.
You've got to watch my room.
Wait till morning.
No. Come on, Joe, we're quitting.
- But you can't.
- But we are.
Let's go.
This place gives me the heebie-jeebies.
You're telling me.
- Turn off that radio.
- I can't shave without music.
What are you shaving for?
I'm going to bed.
My whiskers keep me awake.
Leave that alone.
Nolan sent me around here to keep you from cutting out paper dolls.
And if I can't have the comforts that I have in my home, then I'll quit.
- You can't leave. The guards walked out.
- I don't blame them.
Does it mean too much to stop playing that radio?
- Oh, all right, I'll shave without music, then.
- Thanks, Betcha.
To show how I appreciate your sacrifice, this is what I'm going to do.
You were telling me how uncomfortable your bed was last night.
- Tonight you can sleep in my bed.
- So, what's the gag?
You wouldn't be expecting Ellman to pay you a social call tonight, would you?
And have him find me in your bed?
Ha, ha.
- No, thank you.
- Just goes to show you.
Try to be decent and make a fellow comfortable and he thinks it's a gag.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- All right, I'll stay.
- Oh, thanks, Betcha. You're a real pal.
Consider it your room.
You'll find pajamas, cigarettes, a drink, whatever you want.
- Thanks.
- Good night.
Good night. You haven't got an old address book around, have you?
Merritt.
How did you get in here?
What are you going to do to me?
Why did you have me killed?
- The others did it. They framed it.
- You were one of them and you know it.
I tell you, I had no part in it.
If you're going to do anything, get it over with.
Go on, do it.
Don't look at me like that.
I say, don't look at me like that.
Keep away, I tell you. Keep away.
Why, you... Unh!
What do you want? What are you doing?
Your orders were to stay with Merritt.
- He's dead.
- Dead? Who?
- Merritt's dead.
- What are you talking about?
- What happened?
- I don't know.
I heard a window crash and I run into the room...
...looked out the window and there he was laying on the sidewalk.
- I turned around and it was Ellman.
- Ellman?
Do you hear that, Loder?
First it was Trigger, then Blackstone, and now it's Merritt.
I'm beginning to think those deaths weren't a coincidence.
Whether it was or not, we quit stalling.
Listen, you're Ellman's guardian.
You and I are going to Dr. Beaumont's office and get him out.
Wait a minute, there's two of us left.
You're liable to get us both in a jam.
We're in a jam already.
It's either him or us, and I'm telling you, it's not gonna be us.
Dr. Beaumont. Dr. Beaumont.
- I think this is the place.
- John.
Oh, what?... Why, where have you been?
I'm caretaker at the Jackson Memorial Cemetery.
When I came on duty this morning...
...I found him wandering about the tombstones.
He seemed to be in a kind of a daze.
I recognized him from his pictures.
- Thank you very much.
- All right.
Oh, John.
Where have you been?
What have you been doing?
Here, sit down here, will you?
Nancy, give him something hot for him.
That's right. Now, then.
Do you know that Smith, Merritt and Blackstone are dead?
What have you learned that made you think they sent you to the electric chair?
Do you suspect any others?
- Doctor, after some sleep.
- No, Nancy, I must know.
Please, leave me alone.
Now, Ellman, try to think.
I'm positive that Ellman has some knowledge not given to him by man.
He seems to know that these men were responsible for sending him to the chair.
I don't know what the solution is, doctor.
But as district attorney,
I can't let Ellman go on like this.
- No.
- Three men are dead. Others may follow.
- It's like taking justice into your own hands.
- Exactly.
Although I suspect these men of being guilty...
...I've got to get some tangible evidence.
- I'll get it for you.
- How?
I'm going to unlock Ellman's mind.
I shall operate.
What good would that do?
He wouldn't live long enough to tell us.
You said there's only one chance in a thousand he'd live.
- But, it's worth that chance.
- Why?
Werner, the evidence that Ellman will be able to give to you...
...will be nothing compared to the information he'll be able to give me.
Secrets from the beyond.
Things that no man has ever dreamt of are within my reach. Think of it.
Pardon me, doctor.
Mr. Nolan is waiting to see you in your office.
All right.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
What can I do for you?
- We've come to take Ellman.
- What?
He's a menace to society and should be confined to an institution.
He's not normal.
He shouldn't be running around loose.
- As his doctor, I refuse to allow it.
- And as his guardian, I demand it.
Doctor, I advise you to confine your experiments to animals.
- Just you leave man...
- Stop making speeches.
We got a court order for Ellman's removal.
- Right.
- May I see that?
Why, sure, take a look at it.
Nothing phony about it, Mr. DA.
You better get wise, unless you want a murder charge against you and this man.
- We're taking him right now.
- But he's in no condition to be moved.
He's still under my observation.
He needs treatment, and must remain here until I say he's fit to go.
That makes no difference, doctor.
The court order speaks for itself.
Just a moment, gentlemen.
This order is dated November 17th.
- That still gives us 24 hours.
- What?
- That's right.
- Well, what can we do about it?
We can't do anything for 24 hours.
All right, we'll be back tomorrow.
Just remember, gentlemen, we shall hold you responsible for Mr. Ellman.
- We'll take that chance.
All right, let's go.
Good day.
Well, doctor?
I shall operate before morning.
- Doctor. Doctor.
- Yes?
- Ellman, he's gone.
- Gone?
I looked everywhere.
He's not in the hospital.
Loder, Nolan, they must have taken him.
I'll notify Werner.
No, no, wait. I...
I think I know where he might have gone.
That girl knows where Ellman is.
Good hunch following her, wasn't it?
I hope you're right.
Hey, you lug.
Why didn't you make that turn?
I could've bet odds she went straight ahead.
All right, turn and get going.
You had all the time in the world.
Come on, get out of there.
I'll drive this car myself.
I'll bet you I drive...
I'll blow your brains out instead of Ellman.
Come on, get out of there.
I quit.
Open the door.
Please, open the door.
Oh, John, please.
John.
I've been looking everywhere for you.
Why did you go away?
- John, you're ill.
- No, I'm not.
But we've been so worried about you.
Why did you come back here again?
It's quiet.
I belong here.
- There's her car.
- She must be in there.
Hurry up.
Please. We're only trying to help you.
Of course, Nancy, of course.
You have helped me.
- But you can't stay here like this.
- I must. I must.
I'll call Dr. Beaumont.
Let him have it.
What's the matter with you?
Give it to me.
John.
Yes?
- Yes, Nancy.
- John has been shot. He's dying.
What?
Please hurry, doctor.
All right, Nancy.
Do what you can for him till I get there.
- I fixed a place for him.
- Thank you.
Quickly, doctor.
What is it, doctor?
One bullet struck the base of the skull in the area of the blood clot.
If he can only hold out for a little, we might discover what he learned in death.
Oh, can't you forget your questioning?
You're supposed to be a doctor.
No doctor can save his life now.
But if he could only hold...
Now, John.
John, look at me. Try to remember.
You must.
It's so strange remembering.
What, John?
All the things you wanted to know.
How I knew I had been framed.
But how did you find out?
You knew nothing before your execution.
How do you know now?
It's hard to explain.
Try, John, try.
That's why I brought you back from death.
Leave the dead to their maker.
The Lord our God is a jealous god.
But, John, what is death?
Can't you put it into words?
Tell me.
Tell me. You must.
What is death?
I think I can.
- After the shock...
Yes?
...I seemed to feel...
Yes?
...peace and a...
He's happier now.
It will never be known.
The Lord our God is a jealous god.
"Mr. and Mrs. Alison,
Car 96, Compartment 'F'
Orient Express,
Budapest, Visegrad. "
Darling!
Peter.
Aren't you hungry?
No, darling.
Are you?
No, of course not.
Are you sure?
I'm starved.
So am I.
I didn't eat a bite at luncheon.
Well, neither did I.
Whoever eats anything at a wedding luncheon?
They make the food out of papier-mâché.
My salad had been used four or five times this week.
Shall we dine in,
Mrs. Alison?
You mean here in the compartment?
Yeah.
Elegant.
Excuse me, sir, lady.
A terrible mistake has occurred.
They have sold space in your compartment to a gentleman.
It is terrible.
Well?
You are going only to Visegrad which we reach at 2:00.
Might you, perhaps, make room for this gentleman?
Do please forgive this intrusion.
It is not necessary to make it so important.
You need not disturb these people.
I can make myself quite comfortable in the passageway.
Oh.
Oh, we are only going as far as Visegrad.
You're entirely welcome to share this compartment if you wish.
Very kind.
Thank you.
Sorry.
That's all right.
Thank you.
Sorry I frightened you, darling.
It is, after all, better to be frightened than to be crushed.
Well, I'm Peter Alison. this is Mrs. Alison.
Oh, it is a very great pleasure.
I'm Dr. Vitus Werdegast.
So you are going to Visegrad?
Yes, and to Gömbös by bus.
Gömbös is very beautiful.
I, too, am going very near there.
For the sport?
Perhaps.
I go to visit an old friend.
May I?
Certainly.
I beg your indulgence, my friend.
18 years ago, I left a girl so like your lovely wife to go to war.
For Kaiser and country, you know.
She was my wife.
Have you ever heard of Kurgaal?
It is a prison below Amsk on Lake Baikal.
Many men have gone there.
Few have returned.
I have returned.
After 15 years
I have returned.
Go ahead.
My servant is coming.
Take me to
Engineer Poelzig's house.
It is too bad about the rain.
It's very unusual.
This road was built by the Austrian Army.
All of this country was one of the greatest battlefields of the war.
Tens of thousands of men died here.
The ravine down there was piled 12 deep with dead and wounded men.
The little river below was swollen red, a raging torrent of blood.
That high hill yonder where Engineer Poelzig now lives, was the site of Fort Marmorus.
He built his home on its very foundation.
Marmorus, the greatest graveyard in the world.
The driver is dead.
Engineer Poelzig?
Herr Poelzig has retired.
Engineer Poelzig will be expecting me.
I'm Dr. Werdegast.
We've had a bad accident.
Awaken Herr Poelzig at once and take us somewhere where I can dress the lady's injury.
A man was killed.
Telephone the gendarmerie at Visegrad and inform them.
Dr. Werdegast has arrived.
There is no need to worry.
I'm sure that after a good night's sleep, she will be quite all right.
It has been a long time, Hjalmar.
The years have been kind to you.
An accident on the road below.
We are all very fortunate to be alive.
Mr. and Mrs. Alison are going to Gömbös.
Mrs. Alison is slightly injured.
I took the liberty of bringing them here.
Of course.
She will sleep now.
You sold Marmorus to the Russians.
Scurried away in the night and left us to die.
Is it to be wondered at that you should choose this place to build your house?
A masterpiece of construction built upon the ruins of the masterpiece of destruction.
The masterpiece of murder.
The murderer of 10,000 men returns to the place of his crime.
Those who died were fortunate.
I was taken a prisoner to Kurgaal.
Kurgaal where the soul is killed slowly.
Fifteen years I've rotted in the darkness.
Waited.
Not to kill you, to kill your soul slowly.
Where is my wife
Karen and my daughter?
Karen?
Well, what do you mean?
I mean you told Karen
I had been killed.
I found out that much in Budapest.
I mean you always wanted her.
In the days at Salzburg, before the war, always, from the first time you saw her.
I mean that after you saved your own hide and left us all to die in Marmorus you went to Karen and induced her to go to America with you.
I traced the two of you there and to Spain and to South America and finally here.
Where is she?
Vitus, you are mad.
Where is she?
Sorry if I'm intruding.
Not at all.
Do come in, we were just going to have something to drink.
Now perhaps you will join us?
And what would you like?
Oh, uh, whiskey.
Whiskey.
This is a very interesting house you have here, Poelzig.
Has an atmosphere, kind of, uh...
It is indeed hard to describe.
As hard to describe as life or, or death.
It may well be an atmosphere of death.
This place was built on the ruins of that same Fort Marmorus that our unfortunate friend, the driver, described so vividly.
Herr Poelzig commanded Marmorus during the last years of the war.
He is perhaps sentimental about this spot.
And as for the house being interesting an architectural chef-d'oeuvre, it could not be otherwise.
Engineer Poelzig is one of Austria's greatest architects.
Dr. Werdegast is one of Hungary's greatest psychiatrists.
Allow me to introduce myself more fully.
I'm Peter Alison, one of America's greatest writers of unimportant books.
Oh, you are an author, a novelist?
Uh, what kind of things do you do?
Mysteries.
To you, my friend, to your charming wife, and to love.
Are you all right, Joan?
I thought you were asleep.
You are frightened, Doctor?
You are our host.
At your service, madame.
You must be indulgent to Dr. Werdegast's weakness.
He is the unfortunate victim of one of the commoner phobias but in an extreme form.
He has an intense and all-consuming horror of cats.
Come, darling, you must go back to bed.
You're not strong enough.
He is quite right.
You had a severe shock.
You must sleep.
Good night, gentlemen.
Joan.
Forgive my presumption but I must emphasize the extreme importance of Mrs. Alison having complete quiet sleep.
I gave her a very powerful narcotic,
I'm sure it will be effective soon.
Her condition is not sufficiently serious to be cause for alarm but it is decidedly delicate.
Rest is the important thing.
What curious changes it made in her.
You must have noticed it?
It is perhaps the narcotic.
Hyoscine affects certain people very oddly.
One cannot be sure.
Sometimes these cases take strange forms.
The victim becomes, in a sense, mediumistic a vehicle for all the intangible forces in operation around her.
It sounds like a lot of supernatural baloney to me.
Supernatural, perhaps.
Baloney, perhaps not.
There are many things under the sun.
I shall show you your rooms.
Strange about the cat.
Joan seemed so curiously affected when you killed it.
That was coincidence,
I think.
However, certain ancient books say that the black cat is the living embodiment of evil.
At death that evil enters into the nearest living thing.
It is-
The black cat does not die.
Those same books, if I am not mistaken teach that the black cat is deathless.
Deathless as evil.
It is the origin of the common superstition of the cat with nine lives.
You will sleep here, Vitus.
Thank you.
Good night.
Good night, gentlemen.
Good night, Vitus.
Sleep well.
An extremely interesting and capable man.
Yes.
I hope you will be comfortable.
Thank you.
My room adjoins
Mrs. Alison's.
You would like to be near her?
Yes. Thank you.
Do you mind if I keep this door open?
I'd sleep in a cold sweat if you didn't.
You know, this is a very tricky house.
Kind of place where I like to have company.
So this guy Poelzig is a great architect?
Yes.
One of the greatest.
Well, I suppose we've got to have architects, too.
If I wanted to build a nice, cozy, unpretentious insane asylum, he'd be the man for it.
You think Mrs. Alison will be well enough to go on to Gömbös in the morning?
I think so.
That will be swell.
Now, Vitus, we have something to settle, we two.
You were seeking me, Hjalmar?
I beg your pardon.
Where is my wife?
Very well, Vitus.
I shall take you to her.
Next time I go to Niagara Falls.
You will come alone, Vitus.
Wait here.
And this was the entrance to the gun turrets.
Don't you recognize it?
I can still sense death in the air.
There is still death in the air.
It is just as much undermined today as ever.
And this is the old chart room for the long-range guns.
The guns are gone, but the charts are still here.
Now you see, Vitus,
I have cared for her tenderly and well.
You will find her almost as beautiful as when you last saw her.
She died two years after the war.
How?
Of pneumonia.
She was never very strong, you know.
A- and the child, our daughter?
Dead.
And why is she...
Why is she like this?
Is she not beautiful?
I wanted to have her beauty always.
I loved her, too, Vitus.
Lies.
All lies, Hjalmar.
You killed her.
You killed her as I am about to kill you!
Come, Vitus.
Are we men or are we children?
Of what use are all these melodramatic gestures?
You say your soul was killed, that you have been dead all these years.
And what of me?
Did we not both die here in Marmorus
15 years ago?
Are we any the less victims of the war than those whose bodies were torn asunder?
Are we not both the living dead?
And now you come to me playing at being an avenging angel childishly thirsting for my blood.
We understand each other too well.
We know too much of life.
We shall play a little game, Vitus.
A game of death, if you like.
But under any circumstances we shall have to wait until these people have gone.
Until we are alone.
Until tomorrow.
What is it, Hjalmar?
Oh, it's nothing.
Only an accident on the road below.
I want you to stay in this room all day tomorrow, Karen.
You are the very core and meaning of my life.
No one shall take you from me, not even Vitus, not even your father.
Not yet, Thamal.
Put that away.
We will bide our time.
Other lives are involved.
This place is so undermined with dynamite that the slightest mistake by one of us could cause the destruction of all.
Until I tell you different, you are his servant, not mine.
Peter?
Good morning.
Have you slept well?
I must examine the dressing.
Dressing?
I don't remember.
The bus.
We were in the bus and we fell...
I don't remember anything after that.
You don't?
Where is Peter?
Is he all right?
He is not in his room.
He is perhaps at breakfast.
Will you sit down?
What happened, Doctor?
What is this place?
This is the home of my friend, Herr Poelzig.
You will forgive this intrusion?
I came to enquire after the health of my charming guest.
This is Engineer Poelzig, our host.
Where is Peter, uh, Mr. Alison?
I think he is breakfasting.
I'll send for him.
Are you worried, Vitus?
About myself? No.
The girl?
Perhaps.
Oh.
You are interested?
Maybe.
I thought so.
Well, I'm not.
Only spiritually.
Spiritually?
Tonight is the dark of the moon.
And we shall gather, and...
You'd better come, Vitus.
The ceremony will interest you.
Don't pretend, Hjalmar.
There was nothing spiritual in your eyes when you looked at that girl.
You plan to keep her here.
Perhaps.
I intend to let her go.
Is that a challenge, Vitus?
Yes, if you dare to fight it out alone.
Do you dare play chess with me, for her?
Yes.
I will even play you chess for her.
Provided if I win, they are free to go.
You won't win, Vitus.
Hurt?
Not a bit.
What happened last night?
Did I do anything silly?
Silly?
How could you do anything that wasn't entirely lovely?
Do you feel well enough to leave, darling?
I'd feel well enough to leave if I didn't feel well enough to leave.
I don't like this place.
You don't like it.
You haven't had breakfast yet.
I don't like Mr. Pigslow, or whatever his name is.
Poelzig.
Poelzig.
Hurry up and get dressed, darling.
I'll explain everything to Mr. Poelzig.
All right.
Come down when you're ready.
Mmm-hmm.
He wants to know our version of the accident.
An American?
And, uh, will you tell me about the accident, please?
Well, Mrs. Alison,
Dr. Werdegast and I were on our way to Gömbös-
Gömbös? It is my home.
What a beautiful place.
What grandeur, what charm.
You have chosen very wisely, sir.
Gömbös is the pearl of the Carpathian Mountains-
I beg your pardon, sir.
Gömbös, it's very nice, in its way.
But it cannot compare with Pisthyan.
Pisthyan is my home.
There is a place.
Sporty, if you want to sport.
Quiet, if you want quiet.
Gaiety, if you want gaiety.
Pisthyan is God's gift to young lovers. It's-
Pisthyan used to be all right
10, 15 years ago, but now...
Gömbös is the place.
Sir, you are carrying it a little bit too far.
How about the accident,
Lieutenant?
I think it was due almost entirely to the rain.
Part of the road gave way, the bus tipped over and crashed. That's all.
Very well.
May I have your names?
Werdegast,
Dr. Vitus Werdegast.
Peter Alison.
You gentlemen can be reached here?
Oh, uh, you've been very kind,
Herr Poelzig.
But Mrs. Alison and I must get back down to Visegrad.
You see, Mrs. Alison must communicate with her parents in Vienna.
May we ride back with you to Visegrad?
I, uh, should be very happy to accommodate you.
Unfortunately, we of the gendarmerie go about on bicycles.
It would be, uh, very inconvenient for Madame.
I'm afraid it is impossible to get a train out of Visegrad until the express goes through at 11:00 tonight.
I shall be most happy to send you down then.
Thank you, gentlemen.
I should be very sorry if I had inconvenienced you.
And I shall be very sorry, too if you do not decide to go on to Gömbös.
Pisthyan.
Dr. Werdegast, I feel sure that Mrs. Alison is well enough to go on to-
I beg your pardon, but do you play chess?
No.
I used to play a very good hand of poker.
Well, if you don't mind,
I think we'll go on with our game.
Please don't think we don't appreciate
your hospitality,
Herr Poelzig.
Mrs. Alison is still quite shaken up from the accident, you know, and feels she wants to get back to Vienna.
Now, if you could send us down to Visegrad,
I'm sure we could hire a car there that would take us on to Budapest, or at least far enough to get a decent train.
But of course.
I shall be very sorry to see you go but if you and Mrs. Alison think best, why...
I want you to take
Mr. and Mrs. Alison down to Visegrad.
Now, you realize, of course, that this is against the advice of Dr. Werdegast.
And you will have to assume the full responsibility.
Oh, but I'm quite sure she'll be all right.
Then we will go on with our game.
I'm sorry, sir, the car is out of commission.
It will take some time to repair it.
Oh, Mr. Alison.
You see, I-I use the car so seldom myself.
I'm afraid you'll just have to be patient.
Then may I use your telephone?
I'll telephone the hotel in Visegrad and ask them to send a car.
Of course. Of course.
Take the gentleman to the telephone.
Did you get the hotel?
No. The phone's dead.
Did you hear that, Vitus?
The phone is dead.
Even the phone is dead.
Come along, Joan, we're getting out of here, fast.
What happened?
Never mind, darling.
Just stay close to me and don't say anything.
We're leaving, if we have to walk to Visegrad.
Oh, never mind about the baggage.
We'll send for that later.
The main thing is to go and go quickly.
Someone's taken my automatic.
Checkmate.
You lose, Vitus.
We are leaving.
Open the door.
I hope you won't carry this too far, Hjalmar.
Child, I hope you're not afraid of me?
Where is Peter?
What have you done with him?
I?
Surely you don't think I-
It was your servant who struck him down.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Please, child, listen to me.
We are all in danger.
Poelzig is a mad beast,
I know.
I know,
I have seen the proof.
He took Karen, my wife, murdered her and murdered my child.
And you let him live.
I await my time.
It shall be soon.
Very soon.
Until then,
I must do his bidding.
That is why even my servant obeys him.
Did you ever hear of Satanism, the worship of the devil, of evil?
Herr Poelzig is the great modern priest of that ancient cult and tonight, dark of the moon, the rites of Lucifer are celebrated.
And if I am not mistaken, he intends you to play a part in that ritual.
A very important part.
Dear child, be brave no matter how hopeless it all seems.
Be brave.
It is your only chance.
Who are you?
I've never seen you before, have I?
No, I-I don't think you have.
I am Karen, Madame Poelzig.
Karen? Not Karen Werdegast?
Yes, yes, how did you know my name?
Well, I-I know your father.
Oh, no, you are mistaken.
My father died in prison.
Herr Poelzig married my mother.
She died when I was very young.
And he married you?
You're his wife?
Yes.
Karen, listen to me.
Your father is not dead.
I know, I know, he's here in this very house.
He's come for you.
Karen, do you understand me?
Your father has come for you.
Don't, Hjalmar!
Please!
Dark of the moon.
'Tis the night.
We better hurry.
The guests will soon be here for the ceremony.
Peter!
Please let me go! Please!
Don't! Don't!
Please! No! No!
Stop struggling, little fool.
There is a way out.
Come, this way.
Peter, where did he go?
Never mind him.
But you will be dead soon if you do not come quickly.
And Karen?
Karen is dead.
No, I mean Karen, your daughter.
Madame Poelzig.
What do you mean?
She is alive, here in this house.
She is Poelzig's wife.
Where is she?
Where is Karen, my daughter?
Joan.
Joan.
Do you know what I am going to do to you now?
No?
Did you ever see an animal skinned, Hjalmar?
That's what I'm going to do to you now.
Tear the skin from your body, slowly, bit by bit.
How does it feel to hang on your own embalming rack, Hjalmar?
No! No! No!
Joan!
The key. The key.
Let me help you.
Stand back, Werdegast.
Get away, Werdegast.
He wanted to help us.
You poor fool.
I only tried to help.
Now go. Please!
Go.
It's the red switch, isn't it, Hjalmar?
The red switch ignites the dynamite.
Five minutes.
Marmorus, you and I and your rotten cult will be no more.
It has been a good game.
Please stop!
Visegrad, Budapest.
Darling, here's a review of Triple Murder.
"In Triple Murder,
"Mr. Alison's latest mystery thriller
"he fulfills the promise shown by
"The 69th Crime and the Purple Spot.
"We feel, however, that
Mr. Alison has, in a sense,
"overstepped the bounds on the matter of credibility.
"These things could never,
"by the furthest stretch of the imagination, actually happen.
"We could wish that Mr. Alison
"would confine himself to the possible instead of having his melodramatic imagination run away with him. "
Paper, morning paper...
Morning Tribune paper.
How are we gonna know this guy?
Remember, the man in Mike's car gotta see him too.
Oh, that's all right.
I'm going to kiss him, and how.
Good, you might as well make him happy.
It'll be the last pair of lips that hit him.
No.
You don't think he could have gone away, do you?
Here he comes now.
Thanks, handsome.
I just couldn't pass you up.
Believe it or not,
I never saw her in my life before.
I must have overlooked something.
Bloody shame, sir. Close to annoying.
Right under me very nose.
Your nose?
I'll get the car, sir.
Save 'em.
Okay this time, Mr Avery?
How was it for you, George?
Okay.
Oh, Ray. Could we do it again?
Number 10.
Up high! Ninety-nine!
Quiet.
Do you wanna move in and take a close-up at the top of the stairs?
No, that was terrible.
I'll make it over.
Yes, sir.
We'll do it again, folks.
All right, scene 99.
Let's run it over. All of it.
Move that car back here.
Hold it! Come on!
Take it easy.
Mr. Brent... when you dive this time, let's have less gymnastics. and don't spin like a top when you fall.
Okay, let's go. Come on, folks.
Move that one over there...
What's the matter?
What's that?
What's the matter?
Stand back, everybody.
Call a doctor.
Come on, give me a hand.
Let's get him to his dressing-room.
We won't need a doctor, George.
He's dead.
Dead?
Round up every man that had a gun. get the property man and find out who loaded those guns.
And see that the body isn't touched.
I'm going to phone the front office.
Yes, sir.
All right, everybody. Line up over there.
And all you fellas with guns stand over there.
Keep that door closed.
And see that no one leaves the stage and no one comes in.
Yes.
My dear Mr Little,
Since I read your scenario
I have come to the absolutely conclusion
That your name, Mr Little, fits you something beautiful.
And furthermore and yet besides
Bahhh.
Yes?
Oh, yes, Mr Avery. Just a minute.
It's Mr Avery.
Tell him to finish on schedule.
He's two days behind already.
Talking to me is a waste in time.
But he says it's important.
That's the problem.
He's too important entirely.
Hello.
What?
Brent?
Shot?
Dead?
Oy, that's going to cost me a fortune.
What a calamity. Quick!
Call Steiner. Tell him Brent was killed, shot.
What a calamity, what a calamity.
I'll get it, Bill. Thanks.
Yes?
Myles Brent was shot on the set.
Killed!
Mr Grossmith has gone to the stage.
I'll be right there.
Myles Brent.
Killed.
On general principal, not a bad idea.
Except that he happens to be one of our stars.
Get back to your office and do what you can to keep the papers off this until we hear what happened.
Don't give out any story until you hear from me.
Sure, but rescue me as soon as possible.
They'll be on my neck just as soon as the police get the news.
Miss Molly.
Yes?
Phone the brigade on the lot.
And tell them not to let anyone in or out until they hear from me.
Very well.
Thanks.
Hey, why don't you watch where I'm going?
What's the hurry, gumshoe?
Myles Brent's been shot.
Now there's a job that should have been done years ago.
Oh...
You won't have to rewrite any stuff for The Death Kiss now.
Say, Marcia was on the set with him, wasn't she?
Sure, but I don't think she did it.
What stage?
Three.
Drop this stuff in my office, will you?
Myles Brent, huh?
Picture actor.
My wife always liked him.
I had that kind of trouble too.
Come on, let's go.
All right, fellas, here's something hot.
Myles Brent killed. Shot. Sound Stage number 3.
Tonart Studio.
Operator. Operator.
Hey, that's the Evening Star phone.
You're telling me?
Give me the journal, please.
Hello, Tonart?
I want Max Hill in the publicity department.
Come on, snap him.
You know me, Connelly I never held out on the Evening Star yet.
Yeah, I know all about your deadline.
You'll get the pack. Call me back.
Never mind, I'll get it.
Yeah.
Yes, Morris, I know. But can I help it if he's shot in the morning?
You gotta take those things as they come.
Yeah, I'm going over there right away.
The police oughta be here now.
Call me back in ten minutes.
Hey, come back here.
Pull down that door.
Ambulance coming.
Yeah.
Detective Lieutenant Sheehan,
Homicide Squad.
Who's in charge here?
I've been trying to get things straightened out for you.
My name is Steiner. Studio manager.
What happened?
Well, the company was shooting the scene during which several people fired guns at Brent.
And someone used real bullets, huh?
People do get hurt that way.
That's the director's guess.
Oh, the director.
Did he happen to guess who did it?
No.
That's unfortunate.
Looks like we'll have to do some guessing on our own.
Come on, Hill, loosen up.
Did someone really bump him off?
I tell you, I don't know.
Then let us in on the lot so we can find out.
I can't let anyone on the lot.
Marcia Lane was with him in the picture, wasn't she?
Sure, she was doing the lead opposite him.
Marcia, oh, his ex-wife. That helps the story.
What's the name of the picture?
The Death Kiss.
The Death Kiss. Gee, what a tie up.
Stage office on the phone.
Just a minute, boys, I'll be right with you.
Eight men with guns?
Yes.
Well, it might have been an accident, but...
Frank, you don't think it was murder.
Darling, I don't even know ***
Maybe he died of old age.
Maybe he never even existed at all.
Now you wait here.
I'm gonna have a look around.
Yours.
You break it.
Nothing but blanks left in these guns.
Any other guns on the set?
That's all I know of.
You see, Captain, it's strictly an accident.
Lieutenant Sheehan.
What's your name?
Leon A. Grossmith.
I'm the president of this concern.
Well, what about it?
Now look here, Sargeant.
Do you realize what this has cost me already?
You have no idea. It cost me up to now...
Yeah, and it cost Brent his life.
Which also loses me money.
I can't have no more Brent in my picture.
Pardon me, Lieutenant.
Mr Grossmith means to convey that this regrettable accident need not be converted into a Roman holiday for the rabble.
I assure you that Mr Grossmith feels deeply, very deeply the tragedy of this affair.
And his point is, naturally, not to throw consternation into that great and unseen army of Mr Brent's admirers.
Now that is precisely what Mr Grossmith means.
That's just what I was going to say.
Mr Steiner, Mr Steiner.
Pardon me.
What is it?
The peckers are on my neck.
I've got to tell them something.
There's no use stalling any longer.
And they've got a story now about a mysterious woman.
They don't know themselves, but they say it makes a great story.
Tell them it was an accident.
They won't believe it.
Then make them.
You don't know those boys.
They've got imagination.
I don't care if they got fallen arches.
Tell them the Brent shooting was an unfortunate accident.
Yes.
Is that satisfactory to you, lieutenant?
Nothing is satisfactory.
I can't tell what it is because...
I don't know myself.
Here's all he had on him.
Keep that.
Well, I'm sorry to gum up the works.
But it wasn't an accident.
It's murder.
Murder, oy.
What a calamity.
How do you know?
This is the bullet that killed him.
A 38 calibre, center fire.
All the guns the extras used were 45s.
And you can't fire a 38 bullet through a 45 gun.
It's an old Chinese principle.
Where did you get this?
Out of the wall of the set.
Don't you know better than to meddle in police matters?
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to meddle.
I just wanted to help.
You see, I like to dabble a bit in murder cases.
Well you just go and dabble some place else.
All right.
Who is he?
One of our scenario writers,
Franklyn Drew.
Oh, writes detective stories, I suppose.
Yes. How did you know?
They always do.
Well, this makes a difference.
Looks like we've got a murder on our hands.
You go and get that assistant director.
That brilliant young man who said there were no other guns on this set.
Right.
Who is Marcia Lane?
What?
You don't know who is Marcia Lane?
Over a million dollars we spend advertising her all over the nation.
She was on set just a minute ago.
Let's have a talk with her.
Howell, ask Miss Lane to come here.
Yes, sir.
Steiner and the detective want to see Miss Lane immediately.
Well, hurry.
I'm fluttering, sweetheart.
Bill. Tell Miss Lane Steiner and the dick wanna see her.
Okay, chief.
Oh, Pete.
Rush Miss Lane over to Mr Steiner and the dick.
Now?
No, next Tuesday, you sap.
Oh.
Come on, get going.
Oh, all right.
Pardon me, Miss Lane.
Mr Steiner and the dick wanna see you.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
What can they want with me?
They just want to annoy you with a lot of routine questions.
They always question people like you first to give the guilty ones plenty of time to make up good alibis.
It's part of the system.
Been going on for years.
Sit down, Miss Lane.
Thank you.
I don't wish to be unpleasant but there are a few questions
I'd like to ask you.
Certainly.
How long have you and Brent been separated?
We were divorced last May.
Why?
Well, I don't quite see...
Divorce is a matter of record, lieutenant.
I don't think we have to go into that now.
Say, will you go up to your office and write "bad little boy" 500 times?
When did you last quarrel with Myles Brent?
I don't remember.
Didn't you love him?
I wouldn't answer that, Marcia.
Say, just what is your interest in this case?
Personally I don't care who killed Brent.
But I would like to know how it was done.
Besides that, I'm...
I'm a friend of Miss Lane's.
Wasn't your name mentioned during the divorce proceedings?
No. Sorry to disappoint you.
What did you do with your gun, Miss Lane?
My gun?
Yes
I didn't have a gun.
Didn't you use one in the picture?
No.
But when you fired with the other...
As a matter of fact if Miss Lane had fired she couldn't have hit him.
She was around on the other side of the set when the shooting took place.
If you don't lay off,
I'm gonna take you downtown.
What for?
How do I know what for?
Good, I was beginning to be afraid you might say something sensible.
Hey! What are you trying to do there, huh?
Don't move, now.
I got you surrounded.
Don't lie, now.
What did you try to hide there, huh?
Why, nothing...
We'll see about that. Hold this...
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
No, you don't.
Yeah? Oh, yeah?
This letter all ready to mail was found in Myles Brent's pocket.
In this letter he told his lawyer that Marcia Lane refused to sign a release as beneficiary of his life insurance policy.
So you stand to collect $200.000.
Miss Lane's lawyer wouldn't let her sign the release.
I know all about that.
It's too bad you weren't the one that was shot.
So that gives you a pretty nice motive.
No funny business, now.
Come on, keep moving.
Here's your man, chief.
I caught him red-handed.
He was trying to ditch this gun. Look.
Look. It's loaded too.
I tell you, I...
Save your breath.
Put the braces on him, Owen.
Now ain't that astounding?
Something told me to take a squint around.
I sees 'im trying to ditch his gun, see?
And I puts two and two together,
I says to my...
I says to myself, that's the man.
I guess I used uncanny skill.
38 caliber and loaded.
It's the gun all right.
Who is this fellow?
Name's Chalmers.
He was an extra on the set.
Why did you kill Brent?
I never killed nobody.
You can't alibi yourself out of this.
That's the only 38 gun on the place.
You killed him. Why?
I tell you I didn't. You gotta listen to me.
Shut up.
You'll have plenty of time to talk later on.
Do you know this man?
Why, yes.
Everyone on the lot knows him.
He was head electrician for years.
How much did you pay him to kill Brent?
Now wait a minute, lieutenant.
Why not pin the murder on the murderer?
That's not against the rules.
What are you talking about?
Chalmers didn't kill Brent.
How do you know?
His gun hasn't been fired.
How did this gun come to be loaded?
I loaded it for Brent.
I lost my nerve.
So you had planned to kill Brent, huh?
Yes, I wanted to kill him.
I had every reason in the world to kill him.
But he made no attempt.
So you can't arrest him.
Not unless you want to make a fool of yourself.
You know, I'm beginning to think you're giving us the rash.
Prove it. You're a detective.
Take them off, Gulliver.
And maybe we'll put them on him.
Well, we seem to be right back where we started.
Yes, perhaps you may have some very valuable suggestion.
Yes, I have.
What?
The cameras were photographing when Brent was killed.
There might be something interesting on the film. It wouldn't hurt to look.
Not bad.
How soon can we see the stuff?
We could get a print in, say, three or four hours.
Can we get them going?
Certainly.
Come, Mr Grossmith.
You take the name and address of every person on this set.
And warn them all about trying to leave town.
Right.
In any of your books, does the detective ever sock the novelist on the nose?
No.
Write it in sometime.
Seems to me like a good idea.
Marcia.
Oh, Frank.
It won't be very pleasant to see it all over again.
But it may help us a lot if we look carefully.
Is everybody here?
I think so, Mr Grossmith.
Mr Steiner is in the projection booth.
He'll be right in.
All right.
There he is now.
Are you ready, Mr Grossmith?
Yes.
Mr Grossmith's ready.
Quiet, please. Quiet.
All right, turn it over.
Rolling.
Mark it.
Action.
Can I get your car, sir?
It'll be right here.
Thanks handsome.
I just couldn't pass you up.
Believe it or not,
I've never seen her in my life before.
I must have been overlooking something.
Bloody shame, sir. Most annoying.
Right under my very nose.
Your nose?
I'll get the car, sir.
Lights! Turn on those lights!
Not hurt badly, but he must have received a sharp blow.
Yeah, it looks like it was done with a blunt instrument.
You know, I had an uncle once who was knocked out the same way.
Only he got hit with a shovel.
Whoever rocked your cradle overdid it.
A rouge smeered cigarette butt started it off.
Can you tell me if that's studio makeup?
Hard to say.
Perhaps we should call the makeup man to tell you.
Thanks.
How did it happen?
I swear I don't know.
I was leaning over the machine checking the focus
I thought the building came down on me.
How about another print?
Yeah, but we'll take care of it this time.
There was something on.
And whoever cut it off didn't want it to be seen.
If we have the laboratory man provide a new one right away.
Could you, Mr Glossmith?
Why, yes, there's no reason why we couldn't.
Will you come with me?
No, Hillicker will go with you.
I have another angle.
Where do I find this makeup man?
Makeup department.
Clear out in the other end of the lot, just at the end of F street.
Sounds like a sleeper jump.
I'll show you if you like.
Thanks.
It's a special panchromatic rouge of my own make.
Only two people on the lot are in the habit of using it.
Who are they?
Miss Collins and Miss Lane.
Who's Miss Collins?
She's one of our players.
Is she in this picture you're photographing?
No, I believe she's working in The Night Riders and they're out on location.
And the only other person on the lot that uses this rouge is Marcia Lane?
As far as I know.
I see.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Wait a minute.
You have quite a stock of this rouge on hand, haven't you?
A few tubes of it.
Just as I thought.
Anybody could get at it.
Not very well. All the makeup that is not in use is kept in the cabinets.
And the cabinets are locked?
Yes.
It's hidden.
Hello? Just a minute.
It's for you.
Hello.
Yes, Hillicker.
How?
All right. You stick around there and see what you can find out.
Tell Steiner I'll see him at his office.
The negative of that last scene has been ruined.
Someone poured acid in the container.
This thing gets more muddled every minute.
You're telling me?
How do I get to Steiner's office?
I'll show you.
Thanks. And you're not going with me.
Right at the end of the street.
Right. You ought to have a map of this place.
Oh, Lieutenant.
You know that anybody could have taken the rouge from Miss Lane's dressing room.
Sure. A very interesting detail.
What do you make of it, Drew?
Got me.
It's more of a mystery than anything
I ever wrote.
What I can't undertsand is why anyone should want to murder Brent.
Not if it were a supervisor.
I don't see why anybody wants to murder anybody. It's a silly idea.
You're going to try and solve it?
Yes, why not?
It would be fun. Besides...
Marcia?
Yes. Oh, say, Tom.
If you see her, don't say anything about that director.
It would only upset her.
No, no, no, of course not.
If I can help you, let me know.
Thanks.
Has anything been moved on the set?
No. Police instructions were to leave everything undisturbed.
Well I'm gonna have another look around.
I want to find out just how he was murdered.
And with what gun.
I got an idea how Brent was killed.
You wanna hear it?
Some other time. Better go home and sleep it off, Chalmers.
That's what you think.
Chalmers don't know anything, huh?
But listen. I've been on the set and I've been seeing things.
Yeah, snakes and pink elephants, I'll bet.
Yeah, all right, be smart, be smart.
Now listen, you're gonna come to me later.
I'll see you in the morning. Go on home.
Poor boy. All he does is cash his paycheck and drink it.
Wanna have a look around with me?
No.
I'm not much of a detective.
Besides, Mrs Avery is waiting for me.
All right.
Good luck.
Thanks.
Go find Sheehan. He's someplace on the lot.
Bring him here.
Mr Drew. Mr Drew, what happened?
What happened?
Here, here.
Swell, ain't it?
I made it myself.
Who's in there?
It's all right, Sheehan.
Now...
I found the gun that killed Brent.
Where?
Right here in this lamp.
Why, it's gone.
Probably got tired sitting there and decided to take a walk.
No, I'm not kidding.
I came down to the set to take a look around.
Just by accident I noticed this... this... smudge on the lamp here.
So I looked inside.
Found a small Derringer fastened there.
Attached to an electromagnet.
There's the wire it was connected to.
And I got a bump on my head that knocked me out.
This proves one thing.
Whoever killed Brent knew a lot about electricity.
Who's in charge of these lamps?
The head gaffer.
What's that in English?
The chief electrician.
Who is he?
Al Payne.
Where can I find him?
Tom will take you over.
Come here, kid, let me take a look at that head.
That's all right.
Now listen.
You stop monkeying around with police matters.
It's a tough racket.
That head of yours won't stand another wallop.
Come on, let's get going.
Mr Drew...
I've been thinking.
No.
Yeah. The first thing I ask myself when I investigate a murder is whodunit.
That sounds logical.
And the next thing I ask myself is who could do it.
And then?
And then I ask myself again who wanted to do it.
And how do you answer yourself?
Well...
I ain't come to that yet.
You take Chalmers, for instance.
He didn't like Brent.
Why shouldn't he be an exception?
He didn't like Brent on account of Brent had him fired.
When was this?
A couple of months ago. When Chalmers was head gaffer they had an argument.
Head gaffer.
Yeah, Chalmers is an electrician, isn't he?
Yeah, Chalmers had a couple of drinks and him and Brent had an argument.
Say, Gully, you are a first-class gumshoe.
Investigator.
All right, investigator.
Right now, will you run up to the casting office investigate and find out where Chalmers lives?
Sure, what are you gonna do?
Put the finger... I mean apprehend him?
Maybe. You wanna come along?
Oh, boy, I'll say.
Got your gun?
Yep.
Got my gun, my badge...
We'll need those. Come on, let's get going.
The director hasn't anything to do with it.
The channel man really sets the lights.
You mean he tells you where to put the lights.
Yes.
When was this set lit?
The afternoon before.
They rehearsed the scene with the principals so they wouldn't hold when they called the extras.
Do you remember anything particular about that one light?
To be truthful with you, we had a lot of arguments on that set.
Mr Steiner didn't like the photography and he wanted more light.
Steiner? Was he there when it was rehearsed?
Yes.
Who else?
Well, they were all there with the exception of the extra people.
There were no extras there, huh?
No, only Chalmers.
You know, he's a sort of a privileged character around this lot.
He used to be our head gaffer.
Chalmers used to be an electrician?
Yes.
Miss Lane felt sorry for him and made
Mr Avery give him a bit in her picture.
Oh, Miss Lane got him the job.
Yes.
Could you give me the address of the cameraman and Chalmers'?
Sure.
And, by the way...
If a writer by the name of Drew asks you anything don't answer him.
Well, you can't keep me from hoping.
This is it.
Look. It's that Chalmers in trouble again.
Do you wish to see Mr Chalmers?
Yes, is he in, Mrs...
Miss Potts, and I don't know anything at all about his comings and goings.
Doesn't he answer the bell?
No, he doesn't.
I was just going in.
It's cleaning day today, you know.
I suppose he's lying stiff and the place all clotted up with gin bottles.
Let's go in and have a look around, captain.
As a tenant, he wasn't so bad until he lost his job. then he started acting queerlike.
See, I told you.
I laid it all down to him. I said, Mr Chalmers... my bungalow court isn't an alcoholic ward.
As I thought. Drunk again.
Well, this is the end.
This is no key to cure.
Out he goes.
I'm sick and tired of his carryings on.
The fellow's dead.
Dead?
Well, he didn't think of me, no not him.
I suppose my $28.50 back rent was all spent in booze.
Did I have Chalmers spotted.
All I did was ask myself whodunit.
Poison, all right.
Familiar smelling stuff too.
Boy, that guy would drink anything that wasn't too thick to chew.
Well, I guess this about washes up the case, huh, Mr Drew?
Looks like suicide to you, eh, Gully?
Sure.
I guess Sheehan would think so too.
He may be dumb, but he ain't blind.
He's not as dumb as he looks.
Do you wear a wristwatch, Gully?
Huh?
Do you wear a watch on your wrist?
Well... you see, it's a present from the wife.
I gotta wear it.
Why do you wear it on your left wrist?
Well, I use my right hand the most because I'm right-handed.
Did you ever try to write with it on you right wrist?
No.
Neither did, Chalmers.
Which makes this note a very interesting piece of fiction.
Say, Gully.
Come here.
Take a look in here.
Now, what do you see?
A bottle of gin and a piece of ice.
What else?
Use your powers of observation.
Oh, you mean that piece of lettuce in there.
Don't you notice that little service door in the back has been left open?
Whatever. The icemen probably left it that way.
My wife says you can't trust those icemen anyway.
If the iceman had left that little door open when he put in the fresh cake there wouldn't be any ice there now.
Oh, I never thought of that.
Let's have a look outside.
Look. Someone must have stood here a long time.
Them are fresh footprints, ain't they?
Step up there a minute.
Look out for those tracks.
Now what?
Look through the window.
Do you see Chalmers sitting there?
Yeah. The door's open.
Supposing someone stood here and doctored Chalmers' gin in the icebox on this side, and then stood here and watched him drink his last drink. through the window, what would you say?
And then watched him die.
Then wrote the note and put the pencil in his hand, huh?
Yeah. Only that's where he made his mistake.
Put the pencil in the wrong hand.
That's just what I was thinking.
Gully...
You know, if a car was parked here
It would entirely conceal that door and that window.
Yeah.
Then Chalmers didn't kill himself, huh?
Let's leave that to Sheehan.
If I'm any good of a guesser, he ought to be here by now.
We found him tumbled over the table.
Dead, huh?
Don't let Sheehan know what we found out.
I gotcha.
The captain got here 15 minutes ago.
Captain?
What are you and that Keystone cop doing here?
Now looky here, Sheehan, you can't talk that way about me.
Remember I'm chief of the studio police and I got rights.
I...I...
Nature in the raw.
Here's another opportunity for your skill, Lieutenant.
We've been waiting for you,
Everybody around here seems to know more about police matters than the police.
That's noble of you to admit.
Did you two losers touch anything around here?
Nothing important.
Good, then clear out.
And take that uniformed moron with you.
Come on.
Suicide, huh?
Looks like it.
Well, I always thought it was Chalmers right from the start.
Now who's the Keystone cop?
You don't even know Chalmers was left-handed.
Come on!
Left-handed?
Sure.
That starts it all over again.
I can remember when murders were nice, clean, simple things done with machine guns and meat axes.
But this case!
Keep coming.
All right.
What seems to be the trouble?
Battery's dead.
But didn't Miss Lane get a new battery just last week?
Yeah, I don't understand it.
It's bone dry.
The liquid's all gone.
Just as I thought
You were right.
Poison.
The electro... electrolytic *** 38%... distilled water 33%, electrolytic liquid 11% by volume the man said at least a spoonful would kill a man dead.
Electrolytic acid.
Did he say anything else?
No, that was all.
Hey. Ain't them the same kind of tread that left the marks under Chalmers' window?
There's probably a thousand cars in Hollywood that have that make of tire.
Yeah, I never thought of that.
Say, Gully.
I want you to get me the key to Brent's dressing room.
But don't anybody know it's for me.
Say, I'll get you the key to the city if you want it.
I have a couple of things to do.
I'll meet you here in half an hour.
Okay.
Who is it?
Frank, may I come in?
Just a minute.
Why all the locks?
I was just going through some old letters and didn't want to be disturbed.
Oh, I see.
Where have you been?
I've been waiting all afternoon for you.
Oh, I've just been doing a little sleuthing.
Marcia, you trust me, don't you?
Why, yes, of course.
You know I'd do anything in the world for you, don't you?
I believe you would, dear.
Then... is there anything you know about the murder of Brent that you haven't told me?
No.
I've just come from Chalmers' place.
He's dead.
Chalmers?
Poisoned.
You mean murdered?
If it isn't that, it's a good imitation on it.
Oh, how awful.
Whoever did it used electrolytic acid.
Acid out of a battery.
The unfortunate part of the whole thing is that... they used your car and the acid out of your battery.
My car?
That's why my car wouldn't start.
Yes. I only told you this because I'm afraid
Sheehan will find out and arrest you on suspicion.
That would mean headlines and scandal.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to get out of here.
Any place, just so Sheehan can't find you.
But that's running away.
Only for a day or two.
Just to give me time.
I'll go to Mary's at Malibu.
She'll help me.
That's swell.
Make it fast, will you?
There's no knowing how close
Sheehan is behind me.
I'll telephone you when I have it all worked out.
You may have a long beard by then, but I'll try and hurry.
Bye-bye, sweet.
Come in.
Leon.
I suppose you're surprised that
I'm here, huh, Marcia?
Frankly, yes.
You haven't come to see me since... since Brent's accident.
I should think you'd know why.
I don't.
I only know that I... that I want to help you.
I have all the help I need.
Marcia, you mustn't treat me like this.
I never said anything to you while Brent was alive.
But you should know how I feel.
You've succeeded in making your feelings quite plain enough.
Marcia, I...
I'm very fond of you.
Not the kind of fondness I care about.
Please go now, Leon.
I'm in rather a hurry.
Marcia.
Maybe some day you will come to me and ask for help.
Maybe you will apologize to me for laughing about how I feel for you.
Perhaps Brent wasn't killed for nothing.
No matter how smart they are they always slip up.
What's your name?
Pardon me.
Hello?
Yes, sir, I will.
Oh, wait a minute. Here she is now.
Miss Lane.
Mr Steiner would like to see you in his office.
Thank you.
What's your name?
Mr Wheatcroft.
Mr Todd, please.
Mr Wheatcroft calling to see you.
All right, thank you.
Pull down that blind.
Did you see Brent when he came in?
I see everybody.
What kind of a suit did he have on?
There it is.
Funny Sheehan missed looking in here.
You've been keeping him too busy.
See what those letters are.
Here's one from a dame named Agnes.
Agnes who?
She ain't that dumb.
She don't say much.
Except that uh... she can't live without him.
Married, too.
Says her husband don't understand her.
Well, it's that old, old story.
Two men and a woman.
The internal triangle.
What kind of place is the Cliffside Inn?
You know, one of those weekend places with all the Mr Smiths, and Mr Jones, and Mr Browns.
Brent wouldn't go there alone, would he?
Not him.
How far is Ocean View from here?
Couple of hours north on the Coast Road.
I guess that's our next stop.
Why?
I'm beginning to think there's a woman in the case.
No...
Mr Drew, this case is becoming complicated.
Even for me.
Come on.
Gee, it's 4:30.
I gotta check in.
Listen. Don't go away without me, will you?
All right, Gully. I'll pick you up at the gate on my way out.
Mr Drew, I've been looking for you.
Miss Lane wants to see you.
She's in Mr Steiner's office.
Thanks.
Yes, sir.
Go right in, Mr Drew.
When did you find out your car wouldn't start?
About an hour ago.
Well, with all your dabbling you didn't throw us off.
You've thrown yourself off if you think Miss Lane had anything to do with Chalmers or Brent either.
All right, all right, just sit down there.
And keep quiet.
Where did you go this afternoon?
I went downtown.
In your car?
Yes.
Where did you park it?
On the street. In front of Ellsmith's flower shop.
I ordered some flowers for Myles...
Mr Brent's funeral.
Then where did you go?
You went to Chalmers' house, didn't you?
Wait a minute, I won't stand for this.
You can't trick Miss Lane into answers.
And have little boy blue over there take them down.
Now keep quiet, Drew. We're trying to get to the bottom of this.
Oh, no, you're not.
Sheehan is trying to force Miss Lane into admission of things she's never done.
She might as well talk here as downtown.
I've got a warrant for her.
For what?
Suspicion of murder.
What's your theory?
It's as simple as ABC.
It would be if you thought of it.
Chalmers killed Brent because he hated him and she offered him money.
Then she got frightened and killed Chalmers thinking that he would get drunk and give it away.
Every piece of evidence we've got points to her.
It was her cigarette that blew the film, her car that made the tracks outside Chalmers' house, and acid from her battery that killed him.
Oh, that's a lot of bunk.
I know.
You've got to make an arrest.
It's okay with you.
Steiner, you can't sit there and... let them arrest Marcia.
She has nothing more to do with these murders than Lincoln had to do with the burning of Rome.
Mr Drew, we don't know whether
Lincoln burned Rome or not.
And we don't care.
But this man is a policeman, so let us hear what he has to say.
We are not paying you to quarrel with the police.
I don't care if you pay me a dime.
Sheehan, if you arrest Miss Lane now there'll be a lot of nasty newspaper headlines.
Hold out for another 24 hours and I'll be responsible.
Better than that, I'll prove she's innocent.
You're making yourself ridiculous.
I'm trying to protect one of your stars.
Wait a minute, Steiner.
Maybe he's right.
What about this scandal?
What about her box-office name?
Haven't we got enough trouble here already without having Marcia arrested?
Mr Grossmith, if you want to accept the responsibility, you can.
But remember...
This is a murder case.
Two people are dead.
And how do you know someone else won't be killed?
For my part, I believe that the police should not be interfered with.
Well, all I gotta say is that it's... a terrible calamity.
Let's go, Hillicker.
I guess the explosion's over.
Someone in this studio killed Myles Brent and Chalmers.
And he's trying to pin it on Marcia Lane.
But they won't get away with it.
Come on, Miss Lane.
Marcia. honey.
I'm sorry.
But I'll get you out of this as soon as I can.
I know you will, Frank.
I'm not worried, really.
Come on.
Special issue!
Read all about it... here.
Hollywood mystery.
Marcia Lane accused of studio murder.
Extra!
Read all about it.
How do you do, sir?
How do you do?
I'm from the publicity office at the Tonart Studio.
Yes?
I'd like to see a list of the people who sent flowers to the Brent funeral.
Oh, I think I have a list.
Thanks.
Terrible thing that Brent murder, wasn't it?
I hear they're investigating Marcia Lane.
Yes, I guess she'll be one who won't send flowers.
Yes, she will. She was here early this afternoon and ordered a big wreath.
Is that so?
Here you are.
Mostly women.
It's surprising many of them gave their names.
Oh, some of them didn't.
There was a lady here just now who signed a check then thought better of it and threw it out.
Didn't want the husband to see the cancelled check.
Perhaps. Oh, pardon me.
Yes, madam?
Do you have any gardenias?
Certainly.
Oh, good evening.
Alone?
Yes, I'm not stopping.
Oh.
I have a key here a friend of mine carried away with him.
Oh, thank you.
My name is Drew.
I'm from the Tonart Studios.
I'd like to keep this thing quiet.
Keep what quiet?
Brent's visit here the night before he was murdered.
You see, if the papers get hold of a story like this they'll play it up and it's bad for the picture business.
Well, it doesn't do us any good either.
All right, let's get together.
Sure, what do you want?
Who was the woman with Brent?
Mrs Brent.
There is no Mrs Brent. They were divorced.
Well, then I don't know who she is.
You see, I wasn't here when they checked in and they left in such a hurry
I didn't see them go out.
In a hurry? Why?
Well, a fellow came in here and started a row
Then he waited in that telephone booth over there and they came down and he stepped out.
At least that's what Charly says.
Who's Charly?
One of the night bellhops.
Could I see him?
Sure.
Oh, Charly.
Yes, sir.
This gentleman wants to ask you a few questions.
Shoot.
Do you remember seeing the man who waited for Myles Brent in the telephone booth the other night?
I just got a glimpse of him before the fight.
What fight?
When Brent hit him in the patio.
How did it happen?
The lady ran out to the car when she saw the guy came out of the booth.
Then the guy steps up to Mr Brent and says:
Brent, I wanna see you.
I thought it sounded kinda silly because he was seeing him right there.
Then what happened?
Brent takes the guy outside in the patio.
That's when he socked him.
Then did Brent get into his car?
Yeah.
And the other guy picked himself up.
Boy, was he mad.
And was his face red.
What did he say?
What didn't he say.
Listen.
It was awful.
And then he beats it.
Would you remember this man if you saw him again?
Well, I might.
And then again, I might not.
It all  happened so fast.
Would you remember the lady?
Sure. Say, she was a honey.
She talked kind of funny.
Like she was a foreigner, or something.
With an accent?
Yeah.
That's fine, Charly.
You've been a great help to me.
Here.
Thanks.
Good night, and thanks.
Say, are you a detective?
No, I'm just from the studio.
Will there be detectives here?
I hope not.
Call for Mr Wallace.
Calling Mr Wallace.
Which booth did that fellow hide in?
There.
How long has it been out of order?
Just since the guy hid in there.
I guess he kept pounding on the hook.
Shelf, shelf, that's all you can think about, shelf.
Already this picture cost me $239.351.
Better I put my money in the bank.
Can I get any interest from a shelf?
I'm not asking you to do anything.
But how can we finish the picture without print?
I told you 17 times that we can use a double.
And play the whole kissing scene in a longshot?
Why not?
Because it's all wrong.
It's terrible.
I've got my reputation to think of.
And I've got my money to think of.
Money, money. What's money?
Now, just a minute.
Let's take it calmly.
The New York office is of the opinion that the murder of Brent won't hurt the picture. if we can release it soon enough.
So why not shoot that scene with a double and wind it up?
It's the last scene in the picture.
It can't possibly do you any harm.
Exactly, Steiner's quite right.
Oh, all right.
What's the use of arguing with him?
Good. We can get the company together and shoot it tonight.
Wait a minute.
What about Marcia?
Oh, we can arrange with Sheehan to use her for that one scene.
She can come over with the whole police department if he likes.
Everybody is on call, everything on the set is standing.
They can shoot it in half an hour.
Todd. Oh, hold on a minute.
What time?
Seven thirty... say nine thirty.
Make it nine o'clock.
We'll save a half hour.
Todd, we are going to shoot the last scene of The Death Kiss tonight.
Round up the company for a nine o'clock call.
Sure, Mr Steiner.
Max, we're retaking The Death Kiss.
Get busy on the call.
Okay.
You have Brent's double on call, haven't you?
Yes, I'll have him all right.
But, say, what about Miss Lane?
I'll take care of her.
Hey, Mac, put that light over on the roof.
Screen 80, Joe.
Good evening.
You know Mrs Avery?
Yes, of course. How are you?
How do you do?
I'm surprised you've come to see the retake.
Put it down to morbid curiosity.
That's the woman of it.
She insisted on coming.
Well, come along with me.
I'll have Howell make you comfortable.
He's very good with the ladies.
Put that light high.
Put it up.
We'll do it the same way.
You two girls in the back.
On the left.
Watch out.
Gulliver.
Yes, Miss Lane.
Do you know where Mr Drew is?
He went away and left me after he promised he wouldn't.
Do you know where he went?
I got an idea, but I can't tell.
Do you know when he'll be back?
I don't know.
He'll turn up.
You can't lose that guy.
We're ready for rehearsal, Miss Lane.
All right, thank you.
Go ahead. We'll wait here.
Thank you.
And just as you reach here,
Miss Lane steps up and kisses you.
And much to your surprise, because you don't know her.
Then you turn, read your line to the doorman and walk out to the kerb.
Right.
Alas, I'm so sorry about it.
I know it's going to be difficult for you, but I'll try and help you all I can.
Thank you, Tom.
Oh, do you know Mr Johnson?
Yes, how do you do?
Shall we try it once?
Oh, George, let's have quiet, please.
Quiet.
Rehearsal.
Take your places, please.
Hit them on.
Everyone ready for rehearsal?
Okay.
Camera.
This business gives me a funny feeling.
What do you mean?
I don't know.
Just gives me a funny feeling, that's all.
Supposing it should happen somebody else gets shot?
That's ridiculous.
Well, maybe it is, maybe it ain't.
Anyway, I don't like the set and I don't like the title of the picture.
The Death Kiss, ugh.
From now on we have no more titles with death in it.
Getting superstitious?
Say, you ain't got no nerves.
I ain't afraid either. I'm just a little scared, that's all.
What can possibly happen?
That's it. Anything.
I must have been overlooking something.
A bloody shame, sir. Most annoying.
Right under me very nose.
Wait a minute.
What's the matter now?
I can't get it with the mike there.
Well, go ahead and fix it the way you want it.
Swing it in here farther.
Come on, farther.
Now down a little closer.
There.
Is that in your picture?
No, it's in place there.
Okay. Test it.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Microphone number two.
All right, let's go.
Okay for sound.
Oh, Lieutenant. Can I see you a minute?
Well, if it isn't our little mystery writer.
I knew you'd turn up.
Have you solved it?
Come over here a minute.
What's the revelation?
I went through the clothes that Brent wore the night he was murdered.
I found a room key to the Cliffside Inn in his pocket.
I went up to the Inn and found that he'd registered there the night before as Mr and Mrs Brent.
Not unusual for him, was it?
No, but the husband of the woman that was with him waited for Brent in the telephone booth in the lobby.
When Brent came down they had a fight.
Brent beat him up and left with the woman.
Now there's your motive.
The fellow who hid in the telephone booth is the fellow who murdered Brent.
It's a motive, sure.
But it seems to me that everyone around here had a motive.
Yes, but the same man knew a lot about electricity and a lot about film.
Now, Chalmers couldn't have thrown that cigarette butt in the film because he was nowhere around at the time.
Marcia couldn't have poured acid on the negative.
She knows less about film than you do.
But the same fellow, whoever it was, found out that Chalmers had discovered his contraption in the lamp.
Stole Marcia's car, took acid again, doctored Chalmers' gin, and then returned the car.
But why did he take Miss Lane's car?
To give himself a double headed out.
If you believed that suicide gag, it would be the end of it.
If you didn't, everything pointed to Marcia.
Whatever happened, he wouldn't be suspected.
Yeah.
But you have got to show me that the guy who is at the end is someone here at the studio.
And that he had access to the light, the film, the car and everything else.
That's easy.
The man who hid in the telephone booth left his trademark.
What's this?
Well, you know as well as I do.
Scribblings a man makes on a piece of paper are as identifying as a signature.
Oh, now all we've got to do is to find the guy that scribbled like this, huh?
I've done that too.
Take a look at this.
Where did you get this?
In Grossmith's office.
Now, Avery, Steiner, Grossmith and Howell were in there having a conference.
And you think one of those four killed Brent?
Yes?
This is interesting.
But I've only your word for it and that don't count for much.
Well, I'll keep your paper dolls.
But you've got to get me more substantial evidence than this before I can let Miss Lane go.
Take good care of these guns, boys, and don't forget to check them back to me.
Thank you.
Sure the gun isn't loaded?
You bet not. I just looked.
Mind if I look?
Not at all.
Is that clear to you?
All right, we'll take it.
Is everybody ready?
Let's make it.
Johnson, powder up, will you, please?
Sure.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Frank. I've been so worried about you.
Darling, I'm hot on the trail.
I've got an idea.
If I'm right, I'll have this whole thing wrapped up and tied before you know it.
But don't go away before I'm through, will you?
You bet I won't.
Miss Lane, will you stand in a minute, please?
See you later.
It isn't loaded, is it?
What do you think, I'm crazy?
Mind if I look?
No, go ahead.
Thanks.
Say, Bill, those aren't the same guns you used before, are they?
I know. I couldn't get 38s before so I slipped in the 45s.
Nobody knew the difference.
You mean 38s were called for before?
Yeah, we made a row about it.
Who insisted?
Okay, coming up!
Come on with me.
Listen. I've got it.
This is Bill, the property man.
He tells me on the day that Brent was murdered he was definitely ordered to give all the extras 38 caliber guns.
Yeah?
Did you get it? 38 caliber guns were ordered.
Now, if Bill had supplied them, we would never have known that it wasn't an accident.
But he didn't.
He had to use 45s.
That's how he knew it was a murder.
Now, the fellow who ordered those 38s...
Say, who ordered those guns?
Go ahead, Bill, tell him.
Well, it was Mr...
Turn those lights on!
Lights. Give me a light.
Here you are, Sheehan.
There he is. There he goes.
Up there.
Come on, he went this way.
No, there he is. Come on.
There he goes.
Stand where you are or I'll shoot.
Avery.
Mr Avery!
He's the that who ordered the guns.
Yeah, and like a fool I told you about him under the microphone.
He was listening in with the earphones.
So it was him.
Don't look at him now. He's dead.
He's dead.
Yes, I am glad.
The woman at the Cliffside Inn, huh?
You stay here, Hillicker,
Come on. Come with me.
I got him. I got him.
There's your man.
Who is he?
You'll suffer for this.
You despicable cad.
So, you're a policeman, eh?
Pardon me.
I think I owe apologies, Miss Lane.
And to you too.
I'm sorry I was unpleasant.
You know, at first I could have sworn it was you.
I knew it and it made me quite angry.
But you're much more clever than
I gave you credit for.
Well, that sounds like a new contract.
We'll talk about that later.
Oh, Lieutenant...
Would you mind telling me why it is that detectives always wear their hats even in the presence of ladies?
Sure.
That's so we won't have anything in our hands or arms in case we have to use them.
That's one for the book.
Do you mind if I write it in right now?
Subtitles: Luís Filipe Bernardes
A Mongolian prince taught me this, Taylor.
An ingenious device for the right occasion.
You'll never lie to a friend again.
And you'll never kiss another man's wife.
Where is Bob Taylor?
- He went on his own there.
- Alone?
Well, after what happened last night I met him, he tell he shouldn't stay with us.
- What did he say?
- He didn't say anything.
It's Taylor's.
I can't find white man.
I guess it's eaten.
Evelyn, you got to forget the Orient.
I know it was horrible, you can't go on like this.
Eric, I never want to see that country again.
Now, why don't you take a stroll around the deck.
I'll catch up with you.
I'm getting a wilds of Dr. Evans zoo.
What are you laughing about?
Just what I wanted to find out.
- What?
- She can smile.
Roger, I'm seriously worry about you, please don't let him see us together again.
He'll be out any minute.
He's making a racket of you Evelyn, because you're all tied and knotted.
Something peculiar about your husband.
Something I can quiet make out.
Oh, let's not talk of him.
We mustn't talk about anything.
Evelyn, don't go, Evelyn.
We got to talk, Evelyn.
Tomorrow we will enter the harbor.
- We're docking tomorrow.
- I told you it's hopeless.
But you can go on living with Gorman.
You can break your life because you made one mistake.
Eric would never let me go.
Please Roger, he'll be coming any minute.
- I'm going to have with him.
- But you can't.
I know him, I know what his doing.
On the exhibition a man named Taylor tried to kiss me.
My husband saw it.
The next night he was found in the jungle dead.
The tigers had been there, there no way of probing an...
It's the most interesting group my husband has ever brought back.
Everyone is talking about.
- The ship hold as a regular menagerie.
- Good evening, Mr. Hewitt.
Good evening.
My wife has been telling you about my animals?
Yes, she has.
I've no idea you were interested in animals.
Perhaps you'd like to come along with me and see them?
- It's rather late, isn't it?
- Maybe your right.
They'll be at the public zoo up tomorrow.
I would like to have you see them.
- I'll enjoy it.
- Splendid.
It would be a great pleasure to introduce you to the zoo.
- I have a message for Professor Evans.
- Follow that path to the right.
- You'll find him at the office.
- Thank you.
- Well, I need back to work.
- Oh, don't go yet, Jack.
That one keep flirting with you and I'm getting jealous.
You'll have to choose between us.
You have a message for somebody?
- I am looking all over for Prof. Evans.
- They are nice, aren't they?
He's over there, in the laboratory building.
Thank you.
Thank you.
This is Evans, of the zoo.
I have a man in my outside office named Peter Yates.
Applying for the job of press agent.
Gave your name for reference.
- He seems quiet bright.
- Yates, he's Ok, he's a fair guy.
I hate to disturb you
Dennison, but what about him?
- He drinks a little now and then.
- Ha, you layoff him easy.
Oh, is my last chance.
He brush in top on every job in this town.
Mr. Evans, Mr. Dennison out is a gross falsehood.
Well, I admire your nerve.
Yeah, I had a hunch you would.
- Come in.
- Yeah, right behind you.
Young man, your recommendations are satisfactory.
We do need a press agent.
The zoo is in desperate financial stress and we want every bit of public interest and support we can get, but...
Well, then you can go wrong with old man Yates's boy pick.
Why, I put more business on the blink scary a map, than anyone two men since Mason and Dickson foot left their famous line.
Who the hell would've heard of Niagara
Falls until old Pete came along.
Look, I got a picture somewhere here.
There your are, there it is.
See, there am I standing on the bridge.
You can't miss in the fall, can you?
- No, no.
- Well, that's efficiency.
And if you turn to page 48 you will see why I made Bimsons combinations button hook and can opener a household world.
And that's just a small idea of my ideas.
And besides, I need the job, am I in?
Well, I must admit Mr. Yates,
I'm favorably impressed.
But, do you know anything about animals?
They been my constant companions many of nights.
- I mean...
- That's bring me the point.
About your drinking.
Oh Mr. Evans, I will be frank with you.
There was a time in my life through sorrow and financial reverses, but I have sworn off.
Do you believe me when I tell you
I haven't tasted a single drop for...
Well, I considerable time, a long time.
Two days and three weeks, to be exact.
Well, I give you a chance.
Thanks.
Consider the zoo as a success.
There here is your first assignment.
Mr. Gorman gets off the boat from India this morning.
Hey, you're able to start with a good story, wouldn't you?
Oh, it's a natural to have in the front page of every paper.
Good, you come with me
I'll introduce you to Dr.Woodford.
Yeah, be glad to.
Oh, oh excuse me.
Maybe someone else wants to see this.
Woodford is my associate.
He is a very clever young biochemist and toxicologist
Jack, I want you to meet Peter Yates.
This is Dr. Woodford.
- How are you?
- Yeah, I'm Ok.
I just hire Mr. Yates to head of our publicity.
- Good, we needed.
- Yeah, that's what I think.
Hand me the bottle of
Bethane disulfonic acid.
Ii did it?
No, don't mind, I'll get it.
Oh I'm sorry, I'm strange here, you know.
- I think you better go out to the boat.
- Yeah, good idea.
- Hello, Dad.
- Hello, dear.
This is my daughter Jerry.
Mr. Yates is our new press agent.
- How do you do?
- Well, I'm feeling much better.
Well, well, this is a swell place you have here.
- You think so?
- Yes, sure.
- Oh, my. Stuffed?
- Yes.
There nice that way.
Oh, look it. Hey, you got to have this place screened.
Oh, not locust Mr. Yates, rattlesnake.
- She don't like your book of clipping.
- Oh my God.
Here's the time to meet the boat and I find myself waiting worthy hours with snakes.
Well, goodbye all.
- Oh, you forget your book.
- Let them read it.
Oh, for goodness sake.
I just saw Pete Yates, looking for Gorman.
- What do you suppose he want?
- Probably a drink.
No, he's on the wagon, he's working for the zoo.
Come in.
OH, how do you do?
I'm Pete Yates, Mr. Gorman.
In Publicity Department for the animals.
This is Mr. Hewitt, Mr. Yates.
Oh, my goodness, did you get in the wrong, did I get in the wrong cabin again?
- How are you?
- I'm Mrs. Gorman.
Oh, I beg your pardon again.
Where can I find Mr. Gorman?
He's down in the hall, getting ready to unload the animals.
Animals? Yes, thanks.
I rush right down there.
I beg your pardon, but would be asking to much if I inquire what kind of animals?
Oh, all kinds. Tigers, wild boars, panthers, rhinoceros...
- Did you say rhinoceros?
- Yes.
Yes, of course, rhino, rhinoceros.
Well, goodbye now.
Rhino...
When he knocked, I thought it was Eric.
Oh, please, don't stay here longer, Roger.
- Promise you get in touch with me tomorrow?
- I promise it.
You better go.
Yes, I promise you stop being afraid.
If I only could.
Let me handle your afraid problem.
It will be lots of fun.
- Where can I find Mr. Gorman?
- Over there.
I'm afraid she has a cold.
You want to see me?
Yes, I'm, I'm Peter Yates from Municipal Zoo.
- Oh, yes.
- Publicity Department for animals.
I came to hear the story from you about, about these things.
Fine, fine.
- A cute little thing, isn't it?
- Yes, shake hands.
Oh no, no. I never met the gentleman.
It is a lady.
R3eally, Mr. Gorman I...
Mr. Yates, shouldn't be afraid of wild animals.
Let them alone and they will leave you along.
That must you can say about humans.
You don't meant say you really like these beasts.
I love them.
Their honesty, their simplicity, their primitive emotions.
They love, they hate, they kill.
- I'm speaking of tigers.
- No, no, I, I didn't say a word.
Mr. Gorman, I...
Mr. Gorman...
I have some reporters on deck and... some photographers who are very anxious to take some pictures of you.
I'd like to have you pose with
Mrs. Gorman, she is very attractive.
- You met her?
- Yes, I hope I didn't offended her.
Offended?
Well you see, I thought the gentleman in the stateroom with her was you.
Tell, was Mr. Hubert or Herbert or whatever?
- Hewitt...
- Hewitt yes, was he part of the expedition?
No, no, just a very good friend.
You know Eric, the size of your new collection worries me.
Whether If we haven't room for them all we'll built some new cages.
Yes, yes, with thicker bars.
That doesn't seem to be exactly the problem, it's the expenses of it.
You know Eric, since you've been gone, you don't seem to realize our budget it's been cut four times.
Good heavens, man.
Why didn't you cable me?
I know what I'll do.
I'll get to some of the most influential men in town.
And we make up the differences by private subscriptions.
- Oh, that would be wonderful.
- But how?
I, I beg your pardon, Mr. Gorman.
I have a grand idea.
Why not give a dinner here?
Spread on a long table among all these magnificent animals.
Think of it. Photographs in every paper.
Ha, I can see the front-page now.
Lovely ladies languishing among lions and lamas.
Multimillionaires medicating amid monkeys and mongooses.
Yeah, monguises.
Enthusiasm, novelty, contributions pouring in.
Fantastic.
How would you like to eat with lions and tigers?
Well, if we had the dinner late, then they will be all sleepy.
I wonder...
I do think the thing has values, it's clamorous.
Let us do it.
I'll attend to the arrangements.
- You, you mean to say you like the idea?
- Immensely.
Oh, for good a sake.
Well, that's just the small idea of my ideas.
- Mr. Evans, consider the banquet a success.
- Just a moment.
Woodford, this is something you should interested particularly.
- What's this?
- A snake.
A green mamba.
A new variety I pick up in India.
It kills hundreds of natives every year and no antitoxin has ever been developed for her.
I thought you might want to work on it.
That's great, I'll start this afternoon.
It won't be easy, it's a swift active poison there is.
We'll see what we can do, how about it Jerry?
All right, Jerry.
Good.
Right after lunch, we'll see what we can do to make the world safe from mambas.
You have to find an antitoxin after all Mr. Gorman it's done.
You know, I'd break a leg for the dear old zoo.
That Gorman bird is said of the animals friend, but...
I know what you were going to say.
- You were going to say that's he's...
- He's what?
Oh, isn't not nice to dislike him after he's be so kind.
You realize what the success of his plans would mean to us?
I can go on with my laboratory work.
And you'll have to quit stalling about marrying me.
- Mr. Roger Hewitt?
- Apartment 8B.
- Shall I announce you, sir?
- Isn't necessary.
He expects me.
- But Roger...
- Do not argue with me.
You sail for Paris Friday.
I warn you.
When we are married,
I'm going to run this family.
Here your ticket.
Don't be worry darling, you will be guarded in Paris night and day.
I look after that.
- But...
- I got to but those buts out of your system.
You bring your passport?
In the moment I get my divorced,
- You'll come over in next boat.
- No, on the boat just ahead of your divorce.
Everything seems so simple when I'm with you.
- I wouldn't marry this girl.
- I don't blame you.
- You cable me every day.
- No.
- What?
- I'm calling you.
- Darling.
- Come in.
Mr. Gorman to see you.
Go in that room.
Ask him in.
- Hello, Hewitt.
- Gorman, how are you?
Splendid.
I've pup in to have a little chat.
- Fine. Cigarette?
- Thank you.
You know...
I was rather surprised to find that a man like you just take an interest in something which is... shall we say, outside of his province.
I mean, on the boat you and I seemed to have...
- a mutual interest.
- I'm afraid I don't quite understand.
I was referring to my animals.
Good.
I'm giving a little dinner at the zoo on Thursday night.
I'd like to have you there.
I'll be delighted to come.
We try to raise some money.
I know you're one the few fortunate who still have a little left.
I thought perhaps you might have to give a notable contribution.
- Well, certainly, can count on me.
- That's final then.
- I hope I hadn't disturb you.
- Oh, not at all.
Good.
- Until Thursday then.
- I'll be there.
I can promise you a really unusual evening.
Ah, ladies, ladies, you don't realize how fascinating these wonderful animals really are.
Really.
Stop the man.
Stop, stop the man. Stop that man.
Take your hand of there.
Don't pull it, don't pull anything.
Is all right ladies, be calm, everything will be all right.
- What's the matter?
- Matter, matter...
That's for when they want to clean the cages, that's for if they have a fire, they pull that thing and wind go outcome every lion, every bear, every tiger into new cages.
But the little cages aren't there.
And if you pull that thing,
Oh me, Oh my, Oh mercy.
OH, put it back on the hook.
Here's the story:
Photographer almost releases avalanche of animals on zoo banquet yesterday.
No, not boys.
Boys listen. Listen, no, that's not the right attitude.
I'd tell you, we got to make this thing lovable, pleasant and beautiful.
See, and, and, and beautiful.
He loves me.
Now look...
When I'm at the pinned table and I make my speech and I dos this.
See, that's your signal for take the flash lights, you got it?
- Ok, we got it.
- Don't forget now.
Hello Doc.
- Say, do we eat?
- Oh, sure.
That's just the small idea of my ideas.
Oh, miss it.
Ladies and gentlemen... if you all gather around and find your respective places we'll put on the feed...
Will party it of the refreshments you'll find we have all on the menu, from soup to... nuts.
- Roger?
- Someone is been very thoughtly.
I think,..
Ladies and gentlemen.
Friends...
Friends... it is with keening heart and warm fraternal hand... that I welcome you to the zoo.
This is the zoo of zoos.
You may search up the entire world and never would you find another zoo such as this zoo.
This is...
This is a zoo, beyond any question of a doubt that you can go, you may look, you may search as I said before, you may go from India to Newark and never would you...
- find...
- Come on boys, there is the signal.
Let's take some pictures before
Yates close his ear off.
Your attention, please. Photo, still.
Don't anybody move.
Thank you.
Thank you, boys.
It is however, with the posting love and gratitude in my throat, that that I wish to thank Mr. Eric Gorman, for not only sponsoring this delicious and splendid banquet, but for bringing back from India with him... some of the worst, some of the best most interesting animals in this wild universe to entertain and intrigue you.
Keep your places everyone,
Mr. Hewitt is fainted.
Dr. Woodford will take care of him.
- Get him out of here, doc.
- Yes, bring him this way.
Right this way.
Please stay here and help keep the others calm.
Put it on the table.
He was holding his leg.
It's swelling.
It looks like a snakebite.
Do we have any snakes with fangs such as wild as that?
- Maybe is a mamba bite.
- See if that mamba is on it's cage.
If it's a mamba, the chance is no good.
I see a dozen cases like that in India.
He was dead within five minutes.
You mean the snake was in there among all those people?
Gorman, get everybody away from that table.
I'll do what I can.
There's no antitoxin, it's nothing you can do for him.
The mamba is gone, it's cage is open.
I'll try to keep everyone quiet.
Get out of here, everybody, is a poisonous snake loose...
Get away from that table, there's a poisonous snake under.
It's a mess all,
Fred, grab some pictures.
Where's their telephone?
Come on, Freddy, let's go.
Where's a telephone Miss Evans?
Where's the phone,
I'm of the Morning Records.
Please, don't you see that is for everything is skate-out, everything.
- Skate-out? Going to be a sensation.
- Oh yeah, just as soon not be suppose to it.
Come on, let's find it.
- Where is Evelyn?
- I don't know.
This is horrible, unforgivable.
Well Woodford, it's been a rush of such chances of bring me outside help.
I know it, I can understand how that snake got out.
Loose carelessness on your part and it might be six people as well as of one.
Mr. Gorman, it wasn't his fault and I know it.
I saw him put the snake in the cage and closed it, I've been with him minute.
Come Evelyn, I want to get you out of here, dear.
You are trembling.
Let me get you some brandy.
You killed Roger Hewitt.
No my dear, you're not yourself.
Drink some of this.
That's why you sat oppose him.
Evelyn... you don't think I sat there all evening with a eight foot mamba in my pocket, do you?
Why, It would be an injustice to my tailor.
I don't know how it happened.
But why would he stroke and no one else?
Why aren't you more concern with my narrow escape?
- I sat within two feet of the snake...
- Oh, don't touch me.
- I've never saw you looked more beautiful.
- Yes Eric, I know.
- Now you're going to make love to me.
- I never wanted you more than now.
- Oh, you're not human.
- I'm not going to kiss you...
- You're going to kiss me.
- Kiss you? I hate you.
Hear, Roger and I loved each other.
I was going to leave you for him.
Now will you let me go.
My dearest... why didn't you come and tell me?
You know I have to giving affection to ever stand in your way.
What do you...
- What is it that makes me love you so?
- I hate you.
Open up, open the door, Evelyn.
I'm coming back in five minutes and I expect to find this door open.
Guard.
- Is Dr. Woodford here?
- He is at the house.
- I'm Mrs. Gorman, I got to see him.
- Certainly, Mrs. Gorman.
My dear you don't know what you're doing.
- Give that, give it to me.
- Let me alone.
- Hear now, you're all up are excited.
- You killed him with it.
You murder Roger just as you murder Taylor.
Anything I've done,
I've done because I love you.
If I like to come to kill you...
I couldn't expect to you go on loving me.
Put your off hands away, don't touch me.
I hate you. I hate you.
Come along...
Les, let's go home.
You expect me to go home and forget you're not human?
You think you'll never be find out?
Your wrong.
- I going to tell everyone.
- Just about enough.
You can't fright me anymore,
I'm going to tell them all...
That you are a murderer, that you have no right to live.
I'll make sure they hang you,
I don't care what they do to you.
Please let us in mister, we can not see step out..
Sorry, we can't let anyone in until we find the snake.
We are no afraid of no snakes.
Fred and Jim sneak in there,
I've seen them do it.
They have no business to.
Sam, get those boys out.
It's dangerous.
You kids ought to be glad you're not in there.
But out here we sure don't have any fun.
Look what I got in the stick.
Looks like somebody got ate.
Maybe we'll find a package with some money in.
Hey you kids, you got to get out of here.
Nobody is allow in the zoo.
Oh, we won't hurt nothing, mister, we've been here hundreds of times.
I'm sorry boys, but you got to go.
No one is allowed.
What you got there?
That's just part of a lady's dress.
We fished out of the pond.
You boys get out of here in a hurry.
Some children sneaked in here fished out the alligator pond.
There some other pieces floating around in the water.
- Who was at the main gate last night?
- Perry.
- Where is he now?
- Down the quarts.
Is Perry there? I want to speak to him.
Perry, anyone come in the gate last night?
Mrs. Gorman came in here last night, wanted to see you.
Hello.
No, she isn't here, Woodford.
She hadn't been here the whole night.
I'm very worried about.
I called all her friends.
I can't understand.
Wish you hurry over right away,
I'm afraid something dreadful is happened.
I'll come right over.
What is it Evans?
Something about Evelyn?
For heaven's sake, tell me then.
We are not sure. Can you identify this?
Why yes. I.
I believe is part of a dress that... belong to Eve.
Is she dead?
For some reason that I don't know...
Mrs. Gorman came to the zoo last night to see me.
She never reach the house.
This morning Baker found that... in the alligator pit.
But, why did she come here?
- Why did she come here, Woodford?
- I tell you, I don't know.
You'll never know Eric,
Woodford is telling the truth.
This is a frightful thing, if there's anything on earth that we con do.
There's nothing you can do.
You were responsible for the Hewitt death.
Your carelessness and stupidity, and now my wife has died here.
Died, horrible again because a carelessness.
I'm done with this zoo, Evans,
It's a public menace.
I going to see the city close before anymore of these cases happens.
And for you, Woodford...
I'm going to have you prosecute for complete negligence.
And the charge ought to be manslaughter.
What? No, this is the zoo.
The zoo. ZOO.
Yeah, what? Oh, what you said?
Hey Lion, cut up, will you?
I'm shaving.
I know you boys have families.
Hate to let you go but there's nothing else I can do.
- So long Mike and get luck.
- Thank you.
- Well, so long, Johnny.
- So long, Johnny.
- I'll be seeing you.
- Bye.
- Oh, do you want to see me?
- Oh, yes Mr. Yates.
Father is going to San Francisco to try to sell the animals.
- I know you're press agent.
- Yeah, Publicity Department for the animals.
That's what I mean.
I hate to ask you, but... if we don't know you can stay and help us with them must are going to starve.
Yeah, good.
- What?
- No, no, no. I'm, I...
Oh why, of course,
I'll be very glad to help.
Baker, Mr. Yates is going to help us out.
- That's fine.
- Sure, any little thing that I...
Yeah, follow me.
Oh, for Golly's sake.
- Anything I can do something for you, Peter?
- I could use some perfume.
Now look, I'll only be here for a little while longer if it there's something else you can look at.
Oh, Help, help, help.
- What's wrong, Peter?
- It's the ma, ma, ma, ma, mamba.
I'll get a stake, hold it.
Oh, you don't think
I let her go, do you? Help.
There it go, Peter.
This is one decent press story you'll be able to get to the papers, Peter.
Peter, Peter, speak to me, say something.
Is there a good laundry in this town?
- I won't be off to dinner.
- Know I bring you something on the tray.
Sometimes when I see you working so late at night
I wonder if you're going to make a very good husband.
I only have a few more days left in this laboratory...
- and I've lots of work to finish.
- Oh, you don't have to explain, dear.
Yes, what is it, Woodford?
If I were you
I hurry up here right away.
I just make a discovery that would interest you.
I'm not interested in anything you have to say.
- It could come down in court.
- Fits me perfectly.
On second thought, I'm going to hold back what I have found out until we get to court.
- What you mean?
- I don't care to discuss it over the phone.
Alright, I'll come over.
Come in.
Good evening.
Sit down, Gorman.
Yes, well, what is it?
Why didn't you tell me about the other mamba you brought back?
Other mamba?
I don't know what you talking about.
The mamba that killed Hewitt.
The mamba you killed Hewitt with.
Why, my friend you are mad.
Hewitt was like one of the family.
And that's the motive you brought me here for?
Why, it isn't even funny.
Trying to cloak your own negligence by accusing me.
Look at this, Gorman.
We found the mamba today,
I measured the fangs.
The spread is entirely different from that on the wound in Hewitt leg.
A brilliant discovery.
And you intermediately judged the conclusion that I have another.
There's no other conclusion possible.
Here's the measurement of the fangs of this mamba.
And here's the measurement of the bite on Hewitt's leg.
A difference of 8 millimeters.
No Gorman, this mamba never killed Hewitt. Another one did.
And by your own admission no one but you in the country could have one.
A large and vicious snake...
That I carry under to a banquet and trained to bite my friend but not my wife who was sitting next to him.
Your wife was coming here to tell me of the other snake on the night she was killed.
I think I know how she met her death.
Very ingenious, not you, Woodford?
I told the truth, Woodford.
There was only one mamba.
Ah, Woodford, Oh, Woodford...
- Hello.
- Hello.
You happens to know where Dr. Woodford is?
He called me and asked me to come over.
He was in the laboratory.
We found the mamba this afternoon and he probably ought to show to you.
Oh, Jack...
Jack.
- Why look...
- What is it?
The mamba.
- Jack.
- She must have escaped.
He's been able to kill her before he felt.
He's alive, I'll get the antitoxin.
- What?
- Antitoxin, we finished it today.
Antitoxin?
- Can I help?
- No thanks, I got it.
Call a doctor.
Hello Hello...
All right, all right, sweetie
I'll hold your head on.
Peter Yates, Publicity Department of the animals, speaking.
Gorman? What? He killed?
Police? Did he shoot it? Did what?
Police, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Hello, hello, Dan, Dan.
Yes, sound the alarm right away.
No, no, never mind asking why. Sounded, sounded, go on. I'll tell you later.
This is Whiff, there's a trouble at the zoo.
Ok.
It's got him.
Dr. I like to congratulate on your antitoxin.
It's a splendid piece of work.
So far has worked on three guinea pigs, two rabbits and one Woodford.
Say, where can I find Peter Yates?
Well, just go outside and yell you're from a newspaper, he'll turn up.
MAN: Chandu the Magician.
MAN: In the three years that thou has dwelt among us... thou has conquered the atma of the spirt... and found thy reward in the powers proclaimed by Shiva.
Thou shalt look into the eyes of men... and they shall be as straw in thine hands.
Thou shalt cause them to see what is not there... even unto a gathering of 12 times 12.
My son, I proclaim thee one of the sacred company of the yogi... and bestow upon thee the name of Chandu.
Thou hast done well, my son.
To few indeed of thy race have the secrets of the yogi been revealed.
To you, my teacher, I express my thanks.
- What more can I learn?
- Nothing, now. The world needs thee.
Go forth in thy youth and strength... and conquer the evil that threatens mankind.
I have gazed in the crystal, and I've seen the forces of death and destruction... rising from the brain of a madman.
Look.
- CHANDU: Who is this man?
- YOGI: This man is Roxor.
YOGI: Last of an ancient family that lived in Alexandria.
He has built a home in the rock temple of Madu... that stands on the great cliffs above the third cataract of the Nile.
But why am I appointed to fight this man?
It is fate who has chosen thee for the task, my son.
And because no man fights so well as when he is protecting his loved ones... fate has thrown thine own family in the path of this human monster.
Look.
CHANDU: Dorothy... my sister.
YOGI: Yes. Her husband has brought his family to Cairo... so that he maybe near his friend Roxor.
YOGI: This man, Robert Regent... has a secret of enormous power.
CHANDU:
Yes. For years, my brother-in-law... has worked to perfect a death ray strong enough to destroy whole cities.
- (NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)
- He's never found it.
YOGI:
This death ray in the hands of Roxor...
Means an end to goodness...
An end to all that is noble... all that is sane.
Can't you do something?
Surely the police must be able to find some trace of him.
Oh, please telephone me as soon as you have any news at all.
- Thanks.
- Oh, Mother. Mother, you mustn't worry.
- I'm sure we'll hear from Father soon.
- (DOOR OPENS)
- Mother? Look at the letters I found.
- Where did you get them, Betty?
- In the laboratory.
- You didn't go out there in the dark now?
Oh, Mother, how could anyone be hanging around the garden in this sandstorm?
I thought I might find some clues in them.
But you mustn't go outside again.
Why? Did you see something?
Tell me. Did you bolt the door when you came through?
I... I don't remember.
- What did you see, Mother?
- Nothing, Bobby.
It may be foolish, but I thought I saw a face peering in at that window.
Oh, Mother, let's go away from here.
We can't, dearest. Not until we have some news from your father.
- (CLATTERING)
- Listen!
I thought I heard a door close.
- What's that?
- (EERIE RINGING)
Well, what's the matter?
Don't you recognize me?
- Oh, Frank! (SOBBING)
- There, there.
Now, don't cry. Don't cry.
I've come here to help you find Robert.
- Uncle Frank, do you know about Father?
- Yes, dear.
- Do you know where he is?
- I want to talk to you alone, Dorothy.
My, my, Betty Lou, how you've grown.
And Bobby too. But he's too big to kiss.
Sure. We're grown up pretty nearly,
Uncle Frank... so why can't we stay and hear what you know about Father?
- I'll tell you everything later.
- There's something I want to know now.
What was that bell that rang just before you came in?
That was an astral bell.
It tells you when a yogi is near.
- You're really a yogi now?
- Mm-hmm.
And when I hear that bell, I know it's a warning from a yogi that danger threatens.
- (HOWLING)
- What's that?
DOROTHY: It's only a pride of dogs down by the river.
"Now that I know your plans, no money on earth...
"could persuade me to sell you the secret of the death ray.
"If you try to approach me again,
I shall denounce you to the authorities.
I'm convinced you are a madman and should be dealt with accordingly."
Do you know whom this letter was intended for?
- No.
- Roxor.
- Roxor?
- I'm sure of it. Robert's his prisoner.
- Where?
- That I don't know.
I tried to communicate with his mind, but the crystal revealed nothing.
He must be...
- Dead?
- No, no.
Just probably drugged, that's all.
Unconscious.
Robert Regent, I'm calling you. Calling!
You see? It's useless.
Calling him has no response.
(SCREAMING) Help!
Let me go! Stop it!
- Who sent you here?
- Roxor.
- Where did you see Roxor?
- At the wine cellar of... (INDISTINCT)
Open in the name of Osiris... the blind eyes, sealed lips, deaf ears.
- ## (MIDEASTERN)
- (CHATTERING)
I wish to see Roxor.
The effendi is speaking with a friend and may not be disturbed.
He will see me.
Tell him it is Princess Nadji.
MAN: Bring the princess here.
We must not let her find you here, Abdullah.
I don't know yet whether she is to be a friend or an enemy.
If she proves to be an enemy,
I beg you let me deal with her.
Why? Do you hate the princess Nadji?
I hate her.
Yet I want her more than
I've ever wanted any woman before.
Very well, Abdullah.
If Nadji opposes me... and you serve me well... there shall be a new slave in your harem.
ROXOR: Come in.
Let me have your cloak.
Then I may not feast my eyes on your lovely figure?
- Why have you sent for me, Roxor?
- Why?
To offer you my friendship.
- Well, here we are.
- Yes, but how are we going to get in?
You're not going in.
You're going to stay here and watch.
But it'd be much more fun to go in with you.
Listen, Bobby, in case anything happens to me... your mother and Betty Lou will need a man to protect them.
Stay here.
You have the word, brother?
Open in the name of Osiris... the blind eyes, sealed lips, deaf ears.
But my people are happy and contented.
The great dams have multiplied our crops a hundredfold.
What if I destroy those dams?
- What?
- Yes.
I can do it with one blast from my death ray.
Then where will your people be?
More than a billion tons of water will sweep down on them... drowning them like rats.
The greatest flood since the biblical deluge.
So, unless my people join in making you a modern pharaoh... you will annihilate them.
Pharaoh.
I shall be greater than any pharaoh.
Civilization and all its works shall be destroyed.
Men shall return to savagery... following only one supreme intelligence... me.
You see, you're my prisoner.
Every man in this house is my servant.
- You can't keep me here.
- I shan't try.
You are to be sent to a friend of mine as a present.
Did you call me, master?
Take this woman through the tunnel to the river. A boat is waiting.
Come!
Come, Nadji, quick.
- Chandu!
- (MOUTHS WORDS) Come.
What's the matter with you?
Stop them! Stop those two!
After them!
Stop them!
- Everything aboard, Ahmed?
- Yes, effendi.
Very well.
Mother, is she a real princess?
Yes, Betty.
Uncle Frank says she's descended... from a long line of ancient Egyptian kings.
- And are we really going to her palace?
- No, Bobby.
- We're going to her dahabieh.
- Her "daha" what?
Oh, Bobby, don't you know that's a houseboat?
And the princess says we'll have to travel all night by camelback.
Won't that be great?
Wasn't it strange that chance should have sent you... to look for Roxor just when
I needed you most?
It wasn't chance, Nadji. It was fate.
I mean, it was, uh... It was fate that brought me in front of that door.
At first I didn't recognize you.
You see, it's three years since last we met.
- Remember?
- Yes.
Those days in Paris...
I've thought a lot about them.
I know.
In the yogi monastery, there's a pool... where you can see the face of anyone who's thinking of you.
And did you see my face in it?
If you would have looked in it, you would have seen mine much oftener.
Mother, do you think the princess can help us in finding Father?
I don't know, darling, but Uncle Frank says we'll be much safer... as her guests than if we're left here alone.
Well, I shouldn't be frightened anywhere with Uncle Frank.
Oh, look. There are the camels.
El Mahafi, are you ready to leave?
Yes, Princess, and tomorrow's sun will see us there.
Cush. Cush.
You bloomin' idiot.
Don't you understand plain English?
Voulez-vous cush?
Oh, why don't you kneel down when I ask you to?
Aw, I wish I had it.
- Miggles!
- Captain Chandler.
(CHUCKLES) That's all right, Miggles.
Don't salute me, and don't call me Captain Chandler.
We're out of the army now.
What are you doing in that funny-looking getup?
Nursemaid to a blooming camel.
Oh, I'm so happy I met you, Captain.
You've gotta get me out of this.
You've gotta give me a job.
I'll work for you for nothing. After all,
I was a good orderly, wasn't I, sir?
Are you still drinking, Miggles?
Well, sir... (COUGHS)
Changin' the subject, do you still do your magic tricks?
Oh, much better ones. Look at me.
Now look behind you.
- Aaah!
- (CHUCKLING)
Take off your hat.
- Why, you dirty little snoop.
- Who, me?
Oh. Oh, he can talk.
- Oh, take him away.
- (CHUCKLES)
- Make him go away.
- That's all right. He's only in your mind.
Oh, don't tell me I'm going balmy.
He's gone!
How would you like to take a very dangerous trip with me?
Sure. You know me. I love danger.
All right, then. Come on.
Oh, thank you, Captain. Thank you.
Every time you get drunk you're going to see that little fella.
- Understand?
- I understand.
So help me goodness, governor, this is the finish.
When a man starts to see things like that...
- Well, it's time to quit.
- Okay.
- You all right, Princess Nadji?
- Yes.
Miggles. Behave.
I can't thank you enough, Nadji.
Now that Dorothy and the children are safe...
I'll be free to find Robert.
I think I can help you.
- You, Nadji?
- Yes.
Roxor has been seen by some of my people... near the ruins of Madu.
Where are they?
- On the third cataract.
- How far is it?
Not very far.
My boat can be there in 24 hours.
Go straight to Roxor and inform the master... that the princess and the foreigner are on their way to rescue Regent.
Tell him I will see that the white man gets no further than the houseboat.
And now, tell me.
Have you married since I saw you last?
No. That's one feat of magic that requires a beautiful assistant.
- But you've been in love?
- All the time.
(LAUGHS) I might have known.
There are too many charming women in the world.
Not too many.
Oh, now, don't misunderstand me, Nadji.
All the time in love, but always with the same woman.
Do I know her?
You should.
She was a present to your father and mother on your birthday.
(LAUGHS) You're never serious, are you?
Never so serious as now, Nadji.
Tell me. Have you found someone?
Even if I had, my life belongs to my people.
You know, you told me that three years ago.
You think I'm foolish, don't you?
No, dear. Just very, very young... and making an unnecessary sacrifice.
Sometimes I think so too.
Hello.
You have a visitor.
His name is Abdullah.
He's been coming here very often lately.
Oh. I see.
For the white man.
It is Roxor who commands.
NADJI: I'll order some refreshments.
Ali? Some wine.
- You must be choked with sand and dirt.
- You're right.
I love the looks of the desert, but I hate the taste of it.
I thought I'd pay you a surprise visit.
- I'm afraid I'm rather in the way.
- No, not at all.
But unfortunately, my boat is starting at once.
And is the gentleman I just saw making this romantic trip with you?
Romantic is hardly the word.
With a woman as lovely as you are, Nadji... it couldn't be business.
You have a strange way of paying compliments, Abdullah.
Who is this friend of yours?
He is called Chandu.
Chandu.
Beg pardon, Captain.
Is this where the danger starts?
Not yet.
- (RINGING)
- That's funny. A telephone way out here?
That's strange.
You haven't told me yet.
Why are you going up the Nile?
- You know Roxor?
- Ro... Roxor.
Oh, is he that crazy scientist who lives in one of the rock temples?
Yes.
No, I've never met him.
Is he the man you're going to visit?
I understand that Roxor has discovered... many valuable relics of the 12th Egyptian Dynasty.
Wait.
Drink.
Go on, drink.
CHANDU: This wine is... is poisoned
CHANDU: Robert Regent, I'm calling.
Robert Regent, I am calling.
Robert Regent, where are you?
Look. Look!
The crystal's clearing at last.
NADJI: The great rock temple at Madu.
CHANDU:
Roxor is trying to build a huge death ray.
It's Robert. He's still alive.
NADJI: Roxor is there.
CHANDU: Robert hasn't told him the secret.
NADJI:
Oh, he'll torture him until he does.
CHANDU: That's your servant...
The man who gave us the poisoned wine.
Roxor is punishing him because he failed.
NADJI: Chandu, this man is heartless.
Roxor will kill him.
Not as long as he has any hope of forcing Robert to give up his secret.
What was that message the Arab just brought?
I don't know.
Nadji, you say you know the way to this temple?
Yes.
- (MOANS)
- Quiet, Miggles, quiet.
Oh, Captain!
Quiet, Miggles. Quiet.
Miggles, stay here and keep watch.
Yes, Captain. I can manage.
(GASPING) Captain! Captain!
Captain! Captain!
(MOANING) Captain!
Captain! Captain! Captain! Aaah!
Captain! Captain! Captain!
- Captain!
- What's the matter? What's happened?
One of them bloomin' stone idols hopped off his perch and ran away.
- And he pinched my hat.
- You've been drinking again, have you?
So help me, it's true. I swear it on the heads of me unborn children.
Captain! Captain!
Look!
- Chandu!
- Fear not, Princess. You are to live.
But you will see your friends die.
(MOANING) Oh, Mother.
Before we die... accept my blessing.
MAN: Open! Open!
- A fiend!
- A fiend!
Halt!
My will shall be your will.
Now I command you. Take me to the effendi Professor Robert Regent.
- He is not here.
- Speak the truth.
- The master has taken him away.
- Where to?
To the secret market of Bab Doukkala.
There, unless he speaks, he will see his daughter sold as a slave.
- What does it mean?
- It means that Roxor can do nothing... by threatening Robert, so he's kidnapped Betty Lou. Come!
Miggles.
(MOANING) Oh, Captain.
Miggles.
Oh, governor, take away those snakes.
Come on, Miggles.
Pick up your gun. Pick up your gun!
(GASPS) Take it away! Take it away!
Take it away! Take it away!
Never another drop, so help me.
Are you ready to tell me the secret of the death ray?
No.
You still may change your mind.
Never.
- Father! Father!
- Betty Lou!
My child.
What are you going to do with her?
That depends on you.
Will you tell me the secret of the ray?
- No.
- Take her to the block.
- ROBERT: No! No!
- No, no, no! (SOBBING)
- Don't!
- Father!
- (SOBBING) Father!
- ROBERT: Don't take her!
- Don't!
- Please stop! Father! Please!
Let her go!
You shall stand at that window and see her sold.
Help me, Father! Don't!
Let me go! Father, help me!
Kill me.
Kill me if you will, but let her go.
Courage, Betty Lou.
It's not too late to save her.
No. Whatever happens to me or mine,
I'll never tell you.
ROXOR: Get out!
Master! Master!
- (CHIRPING)
- Master! Master!
Allah, save us!
I saw the gold with mine own eyes!
This is magic!
Allah be praised!
Stop that man! Run after him!
Run after him!
Guard!
Abdullah!
Guard!
- Why didn't you hold him at the gate?
- He never passed the gate.
When these hands tried to seize him, there was nothing there but a burnoose.
That one.
- GUARD: The devil!
- (ALL SHOUTING)
Now I know who is fighting us.
Chandu... A man who has at his command the wizardry of the East.
- What is his power?
- Ah.
Hypnotism, nothing more.
Is there no way through which we can attack him?
Yes, one.
Samson's strength was in his hair.
Chandu's strength... is in his eyes.
Mother, here they are.
- Oh, Betty!
- Bobby!
- Oh, my poor child.
- Mother, dear, please don't worry about me.
It was dreadful to see Father like that, his face drawn with agony.
- So desperate!
- Don't. I can't bear it.
CHANDU: Now, Dorothy, don't worry.
Please, Frank.
Can't something be done to save him?
I'm going right back after him, dear, as soon as I get fresh horses.
There, there.
- Miggles, be ready to leave in half an hour.
- Yes, sir.
We're going to the rock temple.
All right, sir.
The rock temple, I think he said.
This calls for another drink.
Walking idols and guns that turns into snakes?
This certainly calls for a drink.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Who? Me?
What for?
- For seeing things again.
- Now, go on. Hop it.
Is that a nice way to behave?
I thought you was a gentleman.
And I thought you were a gentleman too.
We were both mistaken, weren't we?
Don't you talk back at me.
I'm not talking back at you.
You're talking to yourself.
Miggles, aren't you ashamed of ourselves?
Every time you drink that liquor, you're not yourself.
If you're not yourself, how am I to know who I am?
If you're not you and I'm not me, then who are we?
Neither of us. Miggles, behave.
All right. I give in.
I'll never touch another.
- Nadji, why this costume?
- I'm going with you.
- No.
- But I might help you.
No, darling.
That last trip was too dangerous.
I couldn't risk losing you again.
At least I can go as far as the oasis.
Please.
If anything happened to you, Nadji, dear... do you think I could ever forgive myself?
Do I really mean so much?
- More than so much.
- (COUGHING)
- The horses is here, sir.
- Nadji.
No, thank you. You'd better order a horse for me, Miggles.
- That's all right. You can have mine.
- Miggles!
What's the matter with you?
You seem nervous.
Well, it's...
It's all this excitement, sir.
Could you fix it up for me, so I could have a drink without seeing anything?
You haven't had one all day?
No, sir.
All right, Miggles. You may have one then.
- Here's to you.
- To you, Miggles.
As I said, sir, here's to you.
Oh, go and take a good swim!
Be careful. This is tear gas.
If you break it, it'll blind you.
CHANDU: Well, here we are.
- Dear, keep yourself hidden.
- Don't you worry about me.
You have more important things on your mind.
Never anything more important than you,
Nadji, dear.
Sometimes I wonder if you really know the meaning of danger.
I do, darling. I do when it concerns you.
You know, I'm not a bit afraid... when we are together, and you speak to me like that.
When you look at me like that, nothing else matters.
Be careful. If not for your own sake... then for mine?
A bargain.
And you, darling, be careful... for mine.
Take no chances.
Chandu!
Ride, Nadji! Ride away quick!
(GASPING) I'm helpless.
Roxor was right.
Your magic comes from your eyes.
- Chandu!
- Bring him to Roxor!
DEATH RAY WORKER: Only Regent can do it!
Well done, Abdullah.
Now I'll have my revenge on Chandu.
Yes, but that doesn't tell you how to operate your death ray.
No?
You followed Regent's plans in building this elaborate machine... but he still withholds the knowledge to release its power.
Regent was near to breaking when he saw his daughter on the slave block, wasn't he?
Yes.
If Roxor threatens his wife and children... what then, Abdullah?
In a few hours, his whole family will be here.
How?
In that cell, he's now writing a letter to them.
MAN: Effendi!
- Is the letter ready?
- Where's Roxor?
He's not here.
If you'll take it to my family, they will reward you.
It's only a letter of farewell.
- The letter will be delivered, effendi.
- Thank you.
Now look, Abdullah.
For the wife of Robert Regent.
ROXOR'S HENCHMAN:
For the wife of the effendi.
- Are you sure that's really from Father?
- Look, darling, it's his writing.
Oh, wouldn't it be wonderful if we really could save him?
We must save him. I'll get ready.
But, Mother...
There's no need for you to go.
This is a man's job.
- But there's no man here.
- Well, how about me? And Miggles?
- How's that, sir?
- I was just reminding Mother you're a man.
Does she have to be reminded?
If I could only get this bandage off my eyes.
- Oh, if I could only help you.
- Oh, Nadji.
Nadji, what a fool I was to let you come with me.
Don't say that, Chandu.
If these are to be the last hours of your life, I want them to be mine too.
If I could only get you out of here, see you safe once again.
It doesn't matter what happens to me.
I feel so much closer to you now than ever before.
Oh, Nadji, I can't think of losing you... now that I've found you again.
Tell me, if all this hadn't happened... would you have left Egypt, gone with me?
You had only to ask, and I'd have followed you anywhere.
If this is the end, Nadji... let me hear you say "I love you."
I love you.
And I love you.
Well, Chandu, we meet at last.
It isn't quite as you planned though, is it?
Remember this, Roxor.
That the best laid plans of men sometimes go astray.
What do you mean?
I mean that my will is stronger than yours... that it will conquer you.
- That's a lie!
- Is it?
Then why are you afraid to look me in the eyes?
I'm not afraid.
Your eyes would have no effect on me.
Then take off this bandage!
If I were alone, I would.
But these silly natives, they believe your tricks.
You're afraid, I tell you.
Take the bandage from his eyes.
Take it off.
Stop! Stop!
Don't let him fool you.
Get rid of him once and for all.
You're right. (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
You can't do that!
- You can't bury him alive!
- (CHUCKLES)
Why not?
It was a favorite punishment among the priests of Isis who built this temple.
No!
You'd be far better off to kill him.
Why?
Yogis have been known to remain buried for days.
ROXOR: Yes.
But not underwater.
No!
- (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
- No!
No!
- Roxor. Roxor!
- Why are you calling him?
I'll tell him how to work the machine.
Robert, you mustn't!
You said it would mean death to millions.
I'm going to, I tell you, if he'll let you and the children go.
We won't go!
We won't save our lives at such a cost.
Hmm. Why, it's a family reunion.
Let them go, Roxor.
I beg of you, let them go.
There is a way out of this cell, and I'll show it to them.
But not while you are in there.
Just let me stay here.
I don't care what you do with me.
Now, look.
Mother!
ROXOR:
I told you there was a way out, Regent.
That is a river down there... where your friend Chandu has gone.
Have mercy, Roxor!
Stop!
Close it! Close it!
- Will you tell me now?
- Stop!
Mother!
Mother! (WHIMPERING)
- (SCREAMS)
- Stop!
Stop!
- Stop! Stop!
- You'll show me how to work the death ray?
Yes. Yes.
How far will the beam carry?
- Halfway around the world.
- Ah!
Hurry, hurry!
Is it ready?
- (WHISTLE)
- Yes.
Back to his cell.
At last.
I'm king of all.
That lever is my scepter.
London, New York, Imperial Rome...
I can blast them all into a heap of smoking ruins.
Cities of the world shall perish.
All that lives... shall know me as master and tremble at my word.
Paris.
City of fools.
Proud of their Napoleon.
What will they think...
- when they feel the power of Roxor?
- (BOOM)
And England... with its sacred traditions...
Its king. Its triumph... its... its navy...
- will be helpless.
- (BOOM)
They shall bow before me in worship.
Me... Roxor.
- (BOOM)
- I will destroy the dams of the Nile.
And its roaring floods shall sweep down upon... hundreds of thousands... drowning them like rats!
Roxor, the god... whose hand deals death!
Stop! I command you!
Take your hand from that control.
No, you don't frighten me.
You can't move that lever.
I'll move it now!
And you're standing right in the front of the ray.
Your hand is powerless to move, Roxor.
It's a lie.
And you shall be the first man for the ray to kill.
I have come out of a coffin from the depths of the Nile.
My will brought me here... and that will is stronger than yours.
You are helpless.
- No!
- Drop your hands.
Now, stand there.
- Don't move.
- ROBERT: Chandu!
Dorothy! Robert! Are you safe?
Are you all right?
ROBERT: There... It's over... there.
I've doubled the speed of the generator.
The voltage is mounting.
The ambient's at white heat.
The machine will explode in a moment.
- Get out of here, quick!
- Not that way, Frank!
I'm all right. Hurry!
For years I've wanted you, and now I've got you.
- You beast!
- There's no use fighting.
Nadji!
Nadji! Nadji!
Nadji!
Chandu! Look out!
Nadji! Na...
- Captain!
- (BUZZING)
Chandu! Chandu!
- Where are they?
- Let's go.
- Are you all right, Nadji, dear?
- Uncle Frank! Uncle Frank!
Children! Dorothy!
- Thank heaven you're safe, Frank.
- That was brave of you, Robert.
You set the machine to destroy even your whole family... rather than give it to Roxor.
Aaah!
Help!
LITTLE MIGGLES: Where can we get a drink?
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.
Come on.
I hope I'm not very late.
They're upstairs.
His heart is perfect.
Hear that, Betty? I'm in perfect shape.
How did the new valves work on the heart?
Beautifully.
They'll give any pressure you want.
Then we'll get the apparatus ready at once.
Yes, Doctor.
Are you quite sure you want to go through with this?
Yes, Doctor.
You realize, of course, that the possibilities may be unpleasant?
I studied those possibilities all the time you were developing the mechanical heart.
It's worked on every other kind of animal.
Why should man be an exception?
He shouldn't, but we can't be sure until we try.
Well, can't you try on a body that's already dead?
Unfortunately, no.
But if we can revive a man who's been scientifically put to death, then we have the perfect anesthetic.
And in that moment the art of surgery will have advanced a thousand years.
It's the most tremendous thing we've ever worked on.
But what good will that do you if this fails?
I'd rather take a chance on something this great than to live to be 90, marking time.
- Then you're still determined?
- Yes, Doctor.
Oh, Bob, you can't do it. I won't let you.
Now take it easy.
There's nothing to be panicky about.
But don't you realize he's going to kill you?
You're going to die.
That sounds a lot tougher than it is.
I'll be under anesthetic. That's all.
There's nothing to it.
- Well, what if he can't bring you back?
- He won't miss.
Why, inside of two hours, we'll be eating chop suey and fighting about where we're going to go on our honeymoon.
Now don't worry.
Nothing's going to happen to anybody.
Oh, please don't, Bob.
All ready.
Now, don't forget we got a date for chop suey in two hours.
All set.
No, please. You stay here.
And we're not to be interrupted on any account.
Pulse, 47.
Forty.
Respiration, 15. Dropping fast.
He's dead.
Now to draw out the vital heat.
It'll take at least 30 minutes for the body to chill.
I'll test the heart.
How frail a thing to solve the riddle of death.
We're really very stupid, Lang.
We lived surrounded by working models of this machine, and only now it occurs to us to duplicate them in machinery.
The heart is nothing but a pump like this.
Veins and arteries are only tubes like these.
So what could be simpler than to use the glass pump to force the real pump into action after it has stopped?
Maybe we should have made this of steel.
No, then we couldn't watch the course of the blood from the machine into the body.
- We must see in order to learn.
- But if it should break?
If anything fails us now, our lives, as well as his, are lost.
- I don't understand.
- We've taken a human life.
If we don't restore that life, the law will call it murder.
Now look, Lieutenant, all I want is a little statement for the morning edition.
Is the Mayor guilty of that bribery charge or isn't he?
Listen, if I told you newspaper guys what I really thought, they'd snatch my badge right off me.
Officer, Dr. Savaard's going to kill someone.
You've got to stop him.
- How do you know?
- I'm his nurse. I work there.
He's going to kill a young medical student.
- Where's all this happening?
- At Dr. Savaard's house. Hurry!
- What's the address?
- 8700, Post Road. I'll show you the way.
Shane talking. Get hold of Dr. Stoddard and have him meet me at the Savaard home as soon as he can.
The address is 8700, Post Road.
- Does Dr. Savaard live here?
- I don't know if Dad's in, but I'll see.
This house is so rambling, we have a regular phone system.
He's not in the library. I'll try the laboratory.
Hello, Dad.
There's a gentleman here to see you.
No, no, Janet, I must not be disturbed.
I'm in the midst of a crucial experiment.
Send him away and don't let anybody else in.
Careful.
What's causing those gas locks?
They'll wreck the whole thing.
There's the trouble. Those tubes.
Why, they should curve down, not up.
Betty, what's the matter?
In there.
Open up. It's the police.
- The police? How did they get in?
- I don't know.
Hand me the shears.
Take this and hide.
- I'll face this with you.
- No, I'll need you later.
Hide somewhere.
I'll be able to get in touch with you.
What'll I say if I'm caught?
Say I sent you away before the operation started so you wouldn't see how the machine works.
Where will I go?
In the cellar for now.
But hide, and stay hidden.
Open up, I say!
Break it in.
Betty, what's the matter? What's happening?
He's killing Bob.
- All right.
- Over here.
He's dead.
- Dad, what happened?
- That's what I'd like to know.
It's very simple.
I've created a technique for restoring the dead to life, and that young man volunteered to be my first subject.
Now, if you gentlemen will be so kind as to leave my house,
I'll go on with my work.
- Did you kill him?
- I told you, he volunteered.
How did you kill him?
I made use of certain gases that end life without poisoning the tissues.
That's just what I wanted to know.
Unlock my hands!
I've got to restore that boy to life.
- Hello, Lieutenant, what's the trouble?
- Take a look in that box over there.
Look, give me one hour, just one hour to work on that boy.
Why don't you give him a break?
What have you got to lose?
Nothing but my badge.
Well, he's good and dead, all right.
This man says he can bring that body back to life.
- What about it?
- Fantastic.
Inside of an hour,
I can have that boy walking and talking, and explaining it all to you himself.
From what I've seen so far,
I'd say Dr. Savaard has developed a homicidal mania.
Idiots.
Watch out he doesn't hurt himself.
Now, gentlemen, you can think what you like, but give me one hour, just one hour to work on that boy.
I'll get an autopsy order right away.
If you touch a knife to that boy, it'll cost him his life!
Oh, please let him try anything to bring Bob back.
We'll do everything possible, but I tell you now, it's hopeless.
- I'll call the ambulance.
- Doctor!
Now look, that boy trusted me.
He put his life into my hands.
I've got to have one hour to work on him.
Just one hour. You must!
Not a chance, Doc.
Please, it's Doctor Savaard who's asking you this.
A man whose opinion is honored throughout the world.
He'd never have attempted this unless he could see his way through to the end.
You've got to give him a chance.
Oh, come along.
Dr. Stoddard, how long have you been a police surgeon?
About 14 years.
Calling your attention to the night of May 2nd, were you called by Lieutenant Shane to investigate an occurrence at the clinic of Dr. Savaard?
I was.
Would you tell the court what you saw, please?
I found the body of young Roberts in a sort of casket.
He was dead and cold.
I reported his death to Lieutenant Shane officially, then had the body removed to the morgue for autopsy.
In your opinion, could any power on Earth have restored young Roberts to life?
- No.
- Thank you.
Your witness.
Dr. Stoddard, is it not a fact that Dr. Savaard begged you for a chance to restore young Roberts to life,
- and that you refused?
- It is.
- Why?
- Because the idea was fantastic.
Have you never heard of dead persons being revived by drugs?
- Certainly.
- That's all.
Dr. Savaard, will you tell the court very simply just what you hoped to accomplish by placing a man in a so-called state of death?
Today, the surgeon is forced to work against time, because the patient still lives and breathes, and the bloodstream is still flowing.
But think what it would mean to the surgeon if there were no loss of blood, no race against time, no nerve shock, and no fear of death on the table.
It would mean more time for work, work that's undreamed of today, on the heart, on the brain, on the...
Perhaps the jury may find it a bit difficult to follow that explanation, Doctor.
Could you make it even simpler?
To operate on a living body is like trying to repair a motor when it's still running.
But with a motor you can turn the power off.
You can take it apart, find out what's wrong, replace the worn and broken parts, it can be put together and made to run just as good as new.
And you hoped to be able to do that with the human body?
But for the treachery of a stupid woman, my discovery would be part of the knowledge of the world today.
And you really believe that such a thing would be of great and lasting benefit to humanity?
I can think of nothing nearly so great.
This body, this mechanism means nothing.
The mind is all that counts.
But when the body dies, the mind dies with it.
But this we can prevent.
So our first great objective is the replacement of vital organs that have worn out.
And with the body scientifically dead, the surgery of such operations is simple.
But the real secret lies in the pumping of an artificial bloodstream through the body by means of a mechanical heart until the life functions pick up their own rhythm, the heart begins to beat, and life is restored.
Oh, believe me, all this and as much more as the mind of man can encompass is ours for the asking when once we've found the way to make death our servant, and not our master.
Think of it.
The Edison or the Pasteur of tomorrow need not die merely because his heart is worn out.
We'll give him a new heart, taken, perhaps, from the body of a young man who's been killed in an automobile accident.
And our great genius is awakened to another 60 years of useful life.
You ask me if that's of benefit to mankind?
I answer, it's the gift of eternal life.
But whether man is wise enough or old enough to receive such a gift,
I don't know.
I don't know.
That is all.
Your witness.
I've enjoyed the lecture very much,
Dr. Savaard, but if you don't mind, let's return to the object of this trial.
Did you or did you not personally, deliberately and with planned purpose, put young Roberts to death?
I've explained all that.
Answer my question.
Well, I... That is, I...
Did you kill him?
Yes, I did.
That's all.
The counsel for the defense is asking you to free Dr. Savaard because he killed in the name of science, for a high and noble purpose, for humanity.
In Dr. Savaard's own statement, stripped of its fine phrases and reduced to its actual meaning, it means we're to butcher our young athletes so their hearts can be used to prolong the life of some doddering old man, preferably a scientist.
I assure you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
Dr. Savaard's fine ideal would never be permitted in any civilized country.
And yet he wants you to set him free so he can continue that kind of experimentation.
He wants you to license him to kill young men and women.
He wants you to suspend the law and give him the right to go on committing murder without fear of punishment.
I have no quarrel with the great army of honest doctors and legitimate scientists who are trying to make life in this world better.
I ask only that you stop this one killer in his tracks, and you must do more than merely find him guilty.
You must make very sure that no way is left for him to squirm his way out of the hangman's noose.
You must deliver this killer not to a court of appeal, but to the hangman's noose.
You must serve notice to the whole world that the law is still supreme, that human life is still a sacred thing, and that murder, even in the name of science, carries the punishment of death.
He killed the boy. He admitted it.
What more do you want?
It's not as though he'd shot him with a gun.
What do we care how he killed him?
The boy agreed to the experiment.
It wasn't murder.
How do we know he did?
Ladies, gentlemen, we're not getting anywhere at this rate.
Let's get your opinions one at a time, and no interruptions.
- Mr. Sutton?
- As a 100% law-abiding citizen,
I say let the law take its course and hang him.
Men like you have blocked progress for hundreds of years.
Mr. Richards?
I don't think Dr. Savaard is guilty of what we ordinarily consider murder.
What do you call it, then?
- Mr. Watkins?
- I say hang him.
I say hang him, too.
- Mrs. Valentine?
- Couldn't we give him life imprisonment?
And have his lawyers turn him loose in a few years?
- Not while I'm on the jury.
- Yeah.
Dr. Avery?
There's absolutely no reason why life functions can't be restored to a body that's not fatally injured or diseased, providing circulation can be restored.
We're not here to discuss theories, Doctor, but to agree on a verdict of guilty.
Or not guilty!
- All in favor of hanging, stand up.
- Right.
- I'm standing.
- Here I stand.
I suppose you'd pin a medal on Savaard for killing that boy, huh?
Hanging's too good for him, anybody with an ounce of brains knows that.
How can you even turn a man like that loose?
It's open and shut.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?
We have, Your Honor.
We the jury find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree, without recommendation for clemency.
Your Honor.
- Your Honor!
- Order!
Before you condemn me to death,
I would like the privilege of addressing this court for two minutes.
Request granted.
I thank you.
You who have condemned me,
I know your kind.
Your forbears poisoned Socrates, burned Joan of Arc, hanged, tortured all those whose only offense was to bring light into darkness.
For you to condemn me in my work is a crime so shameful that the judgment of history will be against you for all the years to come.
You, Mr. Prosecutor, are guilty of murdering not only me, but countless thousands who might have lived, had you not destroyed the only man who could save their lives.
When your last moment comes, always remember that you killed the one man who could have made your life secure.
Although the stupid, unthinking world may approve what you have done, in your heart you know that but for your treachery, the boy you loved would be alive today.
If anyone is responsible for his death, you killed him.
And for that murder you will live and die in the contempt and loathing of your own heart.
When those you love best lie dying, think back to this moment, when you held their salvation in your hands, and threw it away.
Always remember that I offered you life and you gave me death.
That'll be all, Dr. Savaard.
And you who are about to sentence me, after my death you will be overtaken by a punishment far more terrible than anything that you can do to me.
Sentence will be passed on you at 10:00 a.m. next Tuesday, the 15th.
Take him away.
The jury is dismissed. Court adjourned.
Come on, give her a break, will you, boys?
Let her alone.
Tell me more about it.
Here, now.
- It's all so unfair.
- Yeah, it's a rotten shame.
Here's a man who's spent his whole life trying to do nothing but good, and he gets the works because what he did happens to fit the legal definition of a murder.
Do you suppose if I went to the Governor, there'd be a chance for a pardon?
Look, Janet, nobody can do anything today.
So why not shut off the worries?
Sure, I know it's tough, but you've gotta get ahold of yourself, or you'll crack up.
Now, isn't there a nice quiet place you could go where there'd be someone to look out for you? Relatives, maybe?
- My Aunt Lucy lives in Baycrest.
- Why, that's swell.
It'll be close enough to run into town if you're needed, and far enough out to lose the snoopers and curiosity-seekers.
Hey, buddy, drive us to Baycrest.
On the flat rate.
- But my things...
- Send for them.
Right now, you're gonna hide and stay hidden until this thing quiets down.
You've been very nice to me.
Oh, forget it. I charge all this to expenses.
I don't mean the money.
You've been my only real friend through all this trouble.
How do you know it wasn't just a gag to get exclusive stories?
I know better than that now.
Oh, Dad!
Janet, my dear.
You shouldn't have come here.
Now, you mustn't grieve or be unhappy.
Why, you mustn't even think of me as being dead.
I want you to remember me always as being alive and well and happy, just like someone who's gone away on a pleasant journey.
I've given my body to science, dear.
There'll be no funeral, no grave, and no reminder of my passing.
Now, dear, please.
Well, I guess they're about ready to start.
I've seen eight of these hangings, and each one of them gets worse.
We get many requests for bodies from you doctors, but naturally, we can't do anything without consulting the man himself.
This is by his request.
Dr. Savaard, this man says you instructed him to take your body.
- Is that right?
- Of course.
I'm so glad to see you, Dr. Bruchner.
Sorry, gentlemen.
You'll have to keep apart. Prison rules.
Sorry, I did not understand.
Will you sign this release, Dr. Savaard?
I have some very special equipment ready and waiting to perform an interesting experiment,
Doctor.
One that I am sure you would approve of completely.
I approve of anything that is in the interests of science.
Goodbye, Dr. Savaard, and thank you.
And good luck, Dr. Bruchner.
Good evening.
It seems strange to see you in such good spirits, Doctor.
Strange that I should have no fear of dying?
Well, I have lived so long questioning the unknown that this plunge into its depths is only the last and perhaps the greatest of my experiments.
Have you no faith?
As a scientist,
I'm afraid I'm a professional skeptic who doubts everything, even the certainties.
But do you not recognize certain great truths that all men accept?
I've never found one that would bear analysis.
Can't you conceive of a truth too great for the human mind to analyze?
Tonight, no.
But tomorrow
I may know better.
Okay for you boys to go in now.
- Aren't you coming?
- No, thanks.
I can see everything I don't wanna see from here.
It's time to go.
And Dr. Savaard was hanged
at State's Prison
for the scientific murder
of one of his students.
The man of science mounted the scaffold
with a firm step,
betraying no nervousness.
And giving his last message to the world
with a clear voice, said,
"Though my life be taken,
my work will not be left undone."
This is thought to refer to his theories
in the hands of his students,
and not to the so-called death threat
he uttered at the time of his conviction
to the nine men and three women
who condemned him to die.
Sign right here.
Thank you.
Don't try to speak. Don't try to speak.
No pain.
Can't move.
Paralyzed.
No, you're not. You're strapped to the table.
- Where is instrument?
- Broken. It burst under the pressure.
The next one must be much stronger to force open the capillaries closed by rigor mortis.
Is the break in my neck very bad?
Not now. But it took desperate surgery to make the repair.
It would have been impossible, had you not been dead.
Good work, Lang. Congratulations.
I only followed your teachings.
When you stand once more on the platform, the living proof of your own triumph, the whole world will pay you homage.
Never.
When they see, they will have to believe.
They won't come to learn, only to stare.
I'll be a freak in a sideshow.
Lazarus II.
- Fifty cents to look, a dollar to touch.
- Please, Doctor, you must rest.
Yes, I must rest.
Gain strength and power for what I have to do.
Boss, take a look at that.
Yes, it's all been attended to.
"The body of Harley Ross, 40, well-known local businessman,
"was found late last night by police officers.
"No reason was ascribed for the suicide.
"Mr. Ross chose death by hanging himself."
- Well, what about it?
- Well, does it mean anything to you?
- No.
- Well, look at this one.
Two weeks ago, Ramsay Leith, salesman.
Another suicide, also by hanging.
I still don't get the point.
What are you driving at?
Here's another one about Graham Duff.
Hanged himself over a month ago.
Ahead of him was Percy Shore, and here's two more.
Six of them, all by hanging.
So, over a period of time six guys hanged themselves.
- What about it?
- Nothing, boss, nothing.
Except all six of them were on the Savaard jury.
All six were on the...
What?
Somebody's paying off for what happened to Savaard.
And six of the jurors are gone already.
Scoop, drop everything and go to work.
Get hold of all the remaining Savaard jurors.
Get statements, work up the biggest story you can get.
"Is the Savaard curse working?"
Get the DA, the judge, and everybody else he threatened.
- Statements, pictures, the whole works.
- Okay.
And make it weird, make it dramatic.
And make it snappy.
Right.
Hello. Hello.
Funny, none of these people answer.
They can't all be hiding under their beds.
You know, there've been a lot of cases where a curse actually did work out.
Hello, I'd like to speak to Mr. Kearney, please.
He went where? Are you sure?
Thanks.
Kearney's wife said he got a summons from Judge Bowman who tried Savaard, to meet him at Savaard's house.
Maybe that's why none of the others are home.
The Judge probably called them all.
Here, call the rest of these, will you, and see what you can find out.
Long distance, Baycrest, 732.
Yeah, it's official business.
I wanna talk to Janet Savaard.
I can't imagine why
Judge Bowman should call anyone there.
The house is locked up and I've got the keys.
Hold on a minute, will you?
Get ahold of Lieutenant Shane at Headquarters.
Listen, Janet,
I haven't much time to explain, but there's something funny going on out at the house.
No, don't go out there. Stay out of it.
I'll investigate and call you back later.
Goodbye.
Okay. Lieutenant Shane's gone out to Dr. Savaard's house.
That's where I'm going.
If I'm not back for the deadline, call out the Marine.
I'm Mr. Foley.
I'd like to see Judge Bowman, please.
- Have you an invitation, sir?
- No, but I've got a message from his office.
A matter of utmost importance that I must deliver to him immediately in person.
The Judge hasn't arrived yet, sir.
I have strict orders to admit no one without an invitation. Sorry, sir.
Good evening, Your Honor. Remember me?
I'm Scoop Foley of the Tribune.
- Oh, yes, of course.
- What's the meeting for, Judge?
Meeting?
Yes, you called all these people here tonight, didn't you?
Why, no. As a matter of fact,
I received a telegram signed by Janet Savaard, asking me to meet her here on a matter of life and death.
Well, that's funny.
I talked to her just a little while ago, and she didn't know anything about the meeting.
Well, we'll soon find out what this is about.
If this is someone's idea of a practical joke, we'll soon correct their viewpoint.
- I'm Judge Bowman.
- May I see your invitation, please?
You may come in, sir.
I'm sorry, sir. I can't let you in.
Those are my orders.
- I'll give the orders. Let him in.
- Very good, sir.
In there, please.
Good evening, Your Honor.
What's the idea, Judge?
Are we reopening the Savaard case?
- What brought you here?
- A telegram signed by you.
I sent no telegram, issued no orders.
- Good evening, Judge.
- Why, hello, Judge.
Good evening, Judge Bowman.
I presume you've all been called here by messages supposedly sent by me?
- Yes.
- Yeah. I was served with a court order.
- Well, so was I.
- Mine was a wire.
- Mine also.
- I got a wire, too.
Let me see them.
All fakes.
- This is insane.
- Extraordinary.
Get the butler.
No, you don't. You stick around, too.
Evidently, we're the objects of someone's practical joke.
I'll guarantee them very little laughter when we find out who's responsible.
- Well, I hope so.
- Me, too.
Yes, sir?
- Who is your employer?
- I don't know, sir.
Are you trying to tell us you don't know who hired you?
That's right, sir.
We were engaged through the employment agency and given orders to come here with food and service for nine persons.
But who let you in?
A key was sent with our instructions, sir.
We let ourselves in.
- Who else is in this house?
- Nobody, sir.
That is, nobody that we know of.
What were your instructions?
"You will arrive not later than 5:00 p.m.
"Prepare a cold buffet for the following persons,
"who will bear the following identifications."
Everyone named on this list is here.
- That will be all.
- Thank you, sir.
I was supposed to go to a business meeting.
What time did you receive your telegram?
- Oh, about 3:30 or 4:00.
- That's about the time I received mine.
Hello?
I understand. Yes, sir.
Well, if you're smart, you'll scram out of this place faster than you came in.
Six of the Savaard jurors have been killed already, and you're here to get the rub-out as sure as you're alive.
You're crazy.
Okay, wise guy, but I still say scatter, and scatter fast.
- Maybe he's right. Come on.
- No, he's just dreaming up headlines...
Surely you wouldn't leave without speaking to your host?
Judge Bowman,
I can't tell you how glad I am to see you again.
I trust you'll forgive the unauthorized use of your name to effect this little gathering?
You can understand it would have been indiscreet to use my own.
Shane.
And Kearney.
Good evening, Mr. Drake.
Still skeptical, my police surgeon friend?
You can't be Dr. Savaard. He's dead.
As you perhaps know, hanging breaks the neck.
Would you be professionally interested in seeing how it is repaired?
- How did you do it?
- Too long a story to tell you now.
Perhaps, if you're still interested, at dinner with...
You'll join me in a cocktail, won't you?
Dr. Savaard! Alive!
My only regret is that your fiancé is not here as a living proof of his faith in me.
- Well, what do you think now?
- He wouldn't invite us here to kill us.
That'd be sticking his neck out too far.
Yeah?
Well, I've got an uncomfortable hunch that we're the ones behind the eight ball, not Dr. Savaard.
Allow me.
- No.
- Oh, come.
You're not working for me now.
I happen to know you like sherry.
No.
I want to try something.
- Dr. Savaard, my name is Foley.
- I know. Scoop Foley.
The young man who gets into places without an invitation.
Well, that's my job.
Now look, haven't you forgotten some of the jurors?
There was Dr. Avery and...
And Mr. Richards and Miss Forsythe, who fought for over 60 hours in my defense.
I've no need of them here tonight.
- I see. Thanks.
- Not at all.
Won't you join me in a cocktail?
Thanks, no. I never drink.
Well, what'd I tell you?
What can he do?
We outnumber him eight to one.
Well, won't anybody drink with me?
I assure you they're not poisoned.
I'm sorry, Doctor, but my time is limited.
If you have anything to say,
I'll hear you now.
As a matter of fact, Dr. Savaard, we have more business with you than you have with us.
About those six jurors who mysteriously died.
My dear Mr. District Attorney, your law is shockingly bad.
I have the perfect alibi. I am legally dead.
Your business is with the living.
- lf you have nothing to say, I'll be going.
- One moment, please.
I asked you all here because there's a plot afoot against your lives.
That same fiend who killed the six unfortunate jurors plans to take your lives tonight.
Why should you want to protect me?
I'll explain all that at dinner. Shall we go in?
I'm afraid all this is rather informal.
I hope you found your places.
Miss Crawford, you are here on my right.
Allow me.
I thought it best to dispense with the servants, so I dismissed them.
Oh, do sit down, please, all of you.
May I offer you some pheasant, Mr. Shane?
No, thank you.
How were you brought back to life?
I thought I described the method very thoroughly in your courtroom.
Won't you try some pheasant,
Judge Bowman?
Mr. Drake?
Did you know all along you'd be able to do this?
I gambled that my assistant, Lang, could bring me back.
And here I am, not only alive, but beyond the reach of any law.
Six jurors have been killed.
But what public officer would dare suggest that Henryk Savaard was guilty of the crimes when all the world knows that Henryk Savaard is dead?
Did you kill them?
My dear Shane, and if I did, and if I decided to kill all of you tonight, who would believe that I had done it?
Oh, by the way, your place cards are rather amusing.
If you care to glance at them, you'll find something to your disadvantage.
In this corner is a figure which gives you the order in which you are to die tonight.
And in this corner, the exact time.
You will be the first, Judge Bowman, at exactly 7:00.
In fact, you have a trifle less than two minutes to live.
The man's insane!
- Put him under arrest and lock him up.
- Come on.
Judge Bowman, if you attempt to leave this house, it will be the last act of your life.
Judge Bowman, do not leave this house.
Come on.
- He's dead.
- Well, what killed him?
No marks of any kind. Might be heart failure.
The grille's charged with electricity!
You're telling me.
7:00. Right on the dot.
He knew the surest way to drive Bowman into that grille was to forbid him to leave.
Hey, where is Savaard?
Cover the back door, through the kitchen.
Yell if you see anything.
Boilerplate, eh? I ran into the same thing.
The window.
More boilerplate.
Don't look now, but I think we're trapped.
May I have your attention, please?
All the doors and windows
that you can reach have been sealed,
and there is no way
for you to leave this house.
You will now be punished for your disbelief
in the order and the time stated
on your place cards.
Judge Bowman was taken first
out of deference
to the exalted office he adorned.
The foreman of the jury, Clifford Kearney,
who worked so hard to convict me,
will be taken next,
in recognition of his untiring efforts
to secure my death.
It'll do you no good to search for me.
You can never reach me where I am,
but I can and will reach you,
once every 15 minutes.
At 7:15, Mr. Kearney, you will die.
Until then, goodbye, Mr. Kearney.
He can't do this! You gotta protect me!
You've worked in this house, miss.
Where could he get to from here?
Almost anywhere.
Well, he couldn't have gotten through any of the doors.
Isn't there any way to the balcony except the stairway?
Yes, it connects with the back of the house.
Oh, that's blocked. The grille cuts us off.
- I tell you, you gotta get me out of here!
- Take it easy.
Getting panicky is not going to help us any.
If we could get through that grille and reach the front door, one of us could get to a phone and...
Wait a minute.
Look, there's an extension wire.
It runs down on the baseboard and right in here, see?
And across there.
Dead.
I hope you don't think me stupid enough
to leave you any means of calling help.
Can you hear me?
Please don't shout, Mr. Drake.
I can hear and see you perfectly.
- And what is it?
- We'll be missed.
People know where we've gone.
They'll find us.
They'll find you, too, no matter where you go or try to hide.
Aren't you being a little ridiculous,
Mr. District Attorney?
What sane police officer
would dare even whisper
that what they'll find here tonight
might be the work of a dead man?
Oh, no, Mr. Drake, my alibi is perfect.
Have you forgotten?
I was hanged three months ago.
And now, Mr. Kearney, time is flying.
May I draw your attention to the clock?
What time is it? What's the time?
7:10 by my watch.
Only five minutes left.
We've wasted it all by talking.
- Get me out of here! Get me out of here!
- Take it easy.
We gotta protect him somehow.
Now look,
Bowman was tricked into killing himself.
It's a cinch
Savaard isn't coming down here alone to face all eight of us.
Let's get in the middle of the room away from the balcony, away from everything, and form a circle around him.
Now you're talking.
And if he so much as shows his face out of anywhere, I won't miss.
You'd better get inside, too, miss.
No, I'll take my chances out here where I have room.
Well, all right. Join hands, everybody.
Face out and watch your side of the room.
What time is it now?
Can anyone see the clock?
He may turn out the lights.
Don't let go of your neighbor's hand no matter what happens.
Quiet everyone. Don't move, so we can hear if anyone's coming.
I thought you said the phone was dead.
Sometimes you can call in when you can't call out.
- That may be a chance to get help.
- Don't break the circle. It may be a trick.
If it's an outside call, we're throwing our lives right down the sink by not answering it.
Let me loose. I'll answer it, and the rest of you keep the circle.
All right.
Hello?
Who? Mr. Kearney? Yes.
Who's calling, please?
Mr. Cantrell?
Cantrell's my business partner.
He was expecting me at the meeting tonight.
Stay where you are!
Tell him to call the police.
Mr. Cantrell, listen closely.
Call the police and tell them
Dr. Savaard is alive in his house.
He's already killed Judge Bowman, and he's gonna kill the rest of us.
It's on the level, I tell you.
Here, you talk to him and make him believe it.
Mr. Kearney, don't touch that phone.
Don't let him bluff you, Kearney.
Hello, Frank. Listen. Listen to me.
Frank, can you hear me?
What's that? Well, speak louder.
I can't hear you...
- Look at that!
- What is it, a needle?
Must have worked on a spring inside the receiver.
However it worked, it pierced right into his brain through the ear.
Don't touch that point unless you're eager
to leave before your time.
The poison is very active.
You can put the phone back into the drawer.
I'll not need it again this evening.
Miss Elizabeth Crawford.
For your distinguished treachery
that caused two deaths,
you will be the next to die.
Over my dead body.
That is easily arranged, Mr. Shane.
He must be up there somewhere.
You're quite right, Mr. Shane.
But you'll never reach me.
Come on, fellows, give me a hand with that table. Over under the balcony.
Move him out of the way.
Stop where you are.
If you think we're just gonna sit here and take it, you're crazy.
Come on, fellows.
Give me that chair.
Stop! I warn you, don't jump for that railing.
Let me up there. I'm not on his list.
You are now, Mr. Reporter.
I can't leave anyone alive
to tell what happened here tonight.
It's your move, gentlemen.
Stand back, everybody.
Just as I thought.
The railing's loaded with high voltage, too.
Well, that's that.
You're quite correct.
It makes no difference what you do.
You're completely at my mercy.
In 13 minutes Miss Crawford will die.
Goodbye, Miss Crawford.
- What's that?
- Somebody's at the front door.
- It's a trick.
- Suppose it isn't?
Yeah, that's what you said about the phone.
Janet, don't touch that grille.
It's charged with high voltage.
Beat it for the nearest phone and call the police.
Hurry, before it's too late.
Hurry. He's already killed Judge Bowman.
- Killed Judge Bowman?
- Yes, Dr. Savaard. He's alive.
My father? But it can't be.
- We've seen him and talked to him.
- He's trying to kill us one at a time.
- Where is he now?
- Upstairs somewhere.
We can't get at him.
Janet, don't!
Janet, keep away from him.
Dad.
What brought you here?
You are alive.
What brought you here?
Dad, Dad.
Oh, Janet, my darling.
What are you going to do with that gun?
- You must leave here at once.
- Did you kill Judge Bowman?
- He killed himself.
- Dad, why did you do it?
Are you gonna throw this miracle away only for a cheap revenge?
Not revenge, retribution.
But why anything?
Isn't your mere presence alive rebuke enough?
You only have to show yourself and the world will beg your forgiveness.
Not this world of savage cruelty.
We gave them wings to fly, and they rained death on us.
We gave them a voice to be heard around the world, and they preach hatred to poison the minds of nations.
Even the medicine we gave them to ease their pain is turned into a vice to enslave half mankind for the profit of a few.
Oh, Janet dear, don't you see?
Every gift that science has given them has been twisted into a thing of hate and greed.
But not this one.
That instrument is perfect, the secret of eternity.
But it dies with me after I've made them pay for all they made me suffer.
The shame, the months in prison, the hopelessness, the hideous waiting, knowing the exact hour and moment of the end.
Dad, you're not the man that said goodbye to me.
They killed the man I was.
All that's left is the will to hate and to destroy.
Now go.
All right.
Don't try to send for the police to help these people.
It's useless.
Now, those switches control the lower floor, the grille, the railing, the telephone, everything.
And if there's any interference,
I have only to throw that switch to destroy them all instantly.
But after this is over they'll hunt you down, no matter where you hide.
Oh, no, they won't.
All the clues I'm leaving point to Lang.
They'll hunt for him, but they won't find him.
Lang is dead.
You... You killed Lang?
He threatened to expose my plan to destroy these people.
I had to.
- And you'd kill me too if I tried to interfere.
- Oh, Janet.
You're the only thing in my life that's never hurt me.
You've never brought me anything but happiness.
I don't want anything to hurt you, ever.
- So go away from here, away from me.
- No, I'm not going.
Janet, I have no time.
You must go now, or stay here till the end.
I'm not going.
Then stay out of my way until this is over.
Dad, you don't know what you're doing.
- Janet, you must. You must.
- Dad, wait, wait!
Let me out! Let me out! Let me out!
So, you thought you could escape me by turning out the lights, huh?
So, there you are.
You make a beautiful target, Miss Crawford.
What have you done with Janet?
She's perfectly safe. I only kill my enemies.
In just a few seconds,
the clock will begin to strike.
No!
Let me out! Let me out!
Dad, come and let me out!
Let me out!
Dad, let me out!
Please come and let me out!
Please let me out! Dad, let me out!
Let me out!
Oh, I can't stand it!
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right.
Nice going, kid.
I wanted to spare you all this, Janet.
- You'll go now?
- Yes.
It's better that way. Goodbye.
Go, dear.
You will please not endanger my daughter's safety by making any foolish appeals.
I am sending her away to spare her
any unnecessary shock or pain.
- Are you all right?
- She's quite unharmed.
Miss Savaard, when you get out, call my office, tell them what's happening.
My daughter may call anyone,
because her discovery
of what is happening here
has made it necessary for me
to change my plans.
I can no longer wait
and to kill you one by one.
As soon as she is out of this house
and her car has left the driveway,
I'll end this matter for all of you at once.
Janet, get away before he changes his mind.
- We'll get out of here somehow.
- We'll be all right.
Your pity is wasted, Janet.
Nothing can save them.
- Dad, can you see me?
- I can see every move you make.
- Dad, can you see my hand?
- Yes.
I'm going to open this grille.
Janet, don't touch that grille!
You only have to throw a switch to save my life.
- I'm going to open this grille.
- Don't! Don't!
What happens now is for you to decide.
The juice is off. Break through the grille.
- How does it open? Get a light, somebody.
- I got a flashlight.
Hold it so I can see.
This time I'm not gonna let go for anybody.
- Save Janet.
- She's beyond saving, thanks to you.
Get her upstairs. The laboratory.
The heart will save her.
- Do as he says.
- Yeah, let's go.
The heart's picking up.
It's getting stronger.
Turn off the machine.
Disconnect.
Sterilize.
Bandage her arm.
- Is she all right?
- Yes. It's a miracle.
Believe now, Doctor?
- Dad.
- It's all right, Janet.
You're through the faint of the excitement.
Take her away. She must rest.
We better call an ambulance. He'll need it.
I'll do it. You stick here.
Drake.
- Get Dr. Stoddard.
- Sure.
Dr. Savaard! Don't!
Why did you destroy it?
Come in.
- Sir Lionel Barton, sir.
- Oh, yes, show him in. Show him in.
Come in, sir.
Well, Nayland, what's up?
Well, Lionel, before we go into that,
I want to ask you a very funny question.
- Do you love your country?
- Oh, yes.
All through the war and the Depression and the high taxes and the low rents.
I shall never love another.
Well, Lionel, the British government is asking you to risk your life again.
- Oh, very well.
- All right then.
After you leave here, you're going to the British Museum to meet some friends of yours.
You're going to ask them to join you in an expedition to go to the edge of the Gobi Desert and hunt for the lost and buried tomb of Genghis Khan.
How the deuce did you know all that?
It's my business to know things.
Lionel, you must find that tomb.
We can't allow for any failure, and you must be the first to find it.
Why all the hurry?
- You know Fu Manchu?
- Yes.
He's trying to find it, too.
Oh, I didn't know he was an archaeologist.
Oh, no, he's not.
He's insane for power.
- What do you expect to find in that tomb?
- Records, the golden plate with the threat of Genghis Khan to return, the golden mask he wore and the famous golden scimitar.
Exactly. Of course, in your hands, these things will be merely interesting archaeological specimens to go into the British Museum.
But should Fu Manchu put that mask across his wicked eyes and take that scimitar into his bony, cruel hands, all Asia rises.
He'll declare himself Genghis
Khan come to life again, and he'll lead hundreds of millions of men to sweep the world.
And that, my friend, is what you have got to prevent.
You must find that grave. You must be the first to find it, and you must bring those pretty things back to England.
Of course it's genuine.
Don't you know that the Equus polydactylous, Anchitherium,
Coryphodon, Equus sivalensis:::
But you forget, Equus asiaticus, Equus przewalskii,
Equus lebii, Equus chenensis, Hipparion and...
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Sir Lionel not here yet?
No, Von Berg. It's a funny time to call a meeting.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
I'd hoped to have a long talk, but something's come up that's altered my plans slightly.
Fairgyle, I want two of your men. My two old friends, Von Berg and McLeod.
- Another expedition?
- I was just getting bored with London.
- Can I have them?
- I think you have them already.
Where do we go now?
Well, perhaps I can best answer your question by first telling you that I think I've discovered the buried tomb of Genghis Khan.
- What?
- This can't be so!
Frankly, Barton, I don't believe it.
You always dreamt of this dead raider.
Carnarvon made his dream come true.
Think of what he found in Egypt.
I don't care what it is. I go with you. Where do we go?
I'll show you.
We move secretly.
So it's a toil over these mountains into this valley here.
Then up again and over this range of hills, and right here, on the edge of the Gobi Desert, that's where we camp.
Now, I want you to understand the truth.
From the moment we start, we're in great danger.
There's a fanatic in the East, Dr. Fu Manchu.
- And we have to beat him.
- A Chinaman beat me? He couldn't do it.
Thanks, old friend.
Then we meet again on Sunday to arrange all details.
Get away by Monday.
Thank you a thousand times.
I think I can promise you some great acquisitions for the museum.
That'll be fine, Barton, fine.
Well, good night. Thanks once again.
See you on Sunday night, Doctor.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Terry, I just don't think
I can stand this any longer.
Steady, Sheila.
A whole week not knowing whether he's alive or...
I say, do you know where
Commissioner Smith is?
- We've been waiting nearly 20 minutes.
- No, sir.
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Vernon.
Sheila, sorry I'm late. I was detained.
- Hello, Terry.
- Hello, Nayland.
I brought Terry along.
Have you heard anything?
If I knew anything, I'd tell you.
Excuse me.
Sit down. Sit down, Sheila. I'll be with you in just a moment.
Sheila, you've got to be very brave.
Oh, Nayland, I won't believe my father's dead.
No, no, no, neither will I.
I've just come from a conference with Von Berg and McLeod.
Fine chaps, those men. Depend on them.
Oh, come to the point. You're keeping something back from me.
Sheila, did you ever hear of a Dr. Fu Manchu?
Yes, I've heard Father speak of him to the men.
I remember I couldn't sleep at nights thinking of the terrible...
Nayland, don't tell me that man has anything to do with this.
That my father has been taken by...
You know what they say about him in the East, his cruelty, his unspeakable tortures.
- Nayland, he'll kill him, I know!
- Oh, no, no, Sheila.
- I know he won't do that.
- What does he want of him?
Well, he wants the secret about the tomb of Genghis Khan, and, naturally, he turned to your father.
Oh, I know.
You think they can make him talk.
They can't. I know him better than you.
- She's right, sir.
- I hope so.
They have ways in the East of shattering the strongest courage.
That's why McLeod and Von Berg have agreed to carry on with the expedition, to finish the job of getting to the tomb before Fu Manchu.
- I'm going with Dr. Von Berg.
- Sheila, that's no place for a woman.
Oh, I know. You think I'll crack under it, but I won't.
My father would hate me if I did.
I know much more about the tomb than they do.
I know where it's located.
I can save them days.
Don't you see? Every second counts.
- Sheila.
- It's no use.
- Sheila, I protest.
- I tell you it's no use. I'm going.
The Englishman is here.
Send him in. And tell my daughter I want to see her.
Send him in.
- I want to know the meaning of this.
- Sit there.
You'll answer my question.
Sit there.
Can you remember much of what has happened in the past week, Sir Lionel?
I was attacked in the British
Museum, drugged, of course.
I think I was under the influence of drugs for days.
Then I was in a plane. Now I'm here.
You're Fu Manchu, aren't you?
I'm a Doctor of Philosophy from Edinburgh.
I'm a Doctor of Law from Christ's College.
I'm a Doctor of Medicine from Harvard.
My friends out of courtesy call me Doctor.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Well, Three Times Doctor, what do you want of me?
I have sent for you to make your fortune.
What good are these relics of a dead warrior to you?
Oh, our English people like to look at them on holidays.
Are they worth a million pounds to you?
My dear fellow, I can't sell what I haven't got.
But you will tell me where they are, for money, I mean.
Not for anything in the world.
- Did you send for me, my father?
- My daughter.
Explain to this gentleman the rewards that might be his.
Point out to him the delights of our lovely country, the promise of our beautiful women.
Even my daughter. Even that for you.
Fu Manchu, I'm not for sale.
You've read about this, Barton, the torture of the bell. It never stops.
Minute after minute. Hour after hour. Day after day.
Seems harmless, doesn't it? Just a bell ringing.
But the percussion and the repercussion of sound against your eardrums will soften and destroy them until the sound is magnified a thousand times.
You can't move. You can't sleep.
You will be frantic with thirst.
You will be unspeakably foul.
But here you will lie day after day, until you tell.
You'll be hanged!
Oh, Himmel:
Much more of this, and I won't have no hands left.
Why, we haven't even started, Doctor.
Just wait till we get in the tomb and start to dig out the jolly old skeleton himself.
We've been lucky at that, Von Berg.
We haven't been bothered by any curious Chinamen.
Quite right, Mac, and I hope the same good luck continues when we find it.
If we do.
Aren't you hungry?
Just nod your head, and I'll feed you.
Do you want it? Well?
But I won't talk.
I won't talk.
Doctor! Doctor!
- Mac, I believe I've hit it! Look.
- Let me see.
Come on. Come on, everybody, dig.
Oh, look!
The seal of Genghis Khan!
- Sheila! Sheila!
- Shovel.
He'd be proud of you,
Sheila, mighty proud.
Oh, hurry.
Sheila, it looks like it runs over this way now.
Hurry. Hurry.
Hurry. Hurry.
Rest and quiet.
Now for a nice, long drink.
I forgot to tell you it was salt.
Fiend.
Barton.
Barton.
- Fresh water.
- No.
- Fresh food.
- No.
- And a bath.
- No.
- Sleep.
- No.
- Sleep, Barton, sleep.
- No.
- Day in, day out, sleep.
- No.
Now, tell me. Tell me.
No. No.
- Well, who goes in first?
- Terry. He found the slab.
All right. Age before beauty.
It's all right. Come on.
Think of it, Sheila, we're the first to enter the tomb of the great Genghis Khan.
It's overwhelming. I can hardly believe it.
It just staggers my imagination.
Aye, and you're standing in the first unplundered tomb of a king that died nearly 700 years ago.
Look. Solid gold. Enough to pay a king's ransom.
And sealed with the seal of Genghis
Khan. Terry, give me your knife.
Remember the curse on Tutankhamen's tomb?
All the people connected with it died soon after its opening.
That's a lot of bosh.
Silly superstitions.
They would have died...
What's it say, Doctor?
"May the curse of the
Gods descend upon him
"and his forever
"who dares enter herein. "
I don't like to mar the beauty of these doors, but I have my orders.
It's got to be done.
- Mac, give me the ax.
- I'm afraid of this.
- Afraid of what?
- That curse. Those hideous faces.
Now, Sheila, pull yourself together.
Your father would have done the same things if he was here.
Mac, save those pieces.
- The greatest fighter of them all.
- Yeah.
As powerful in death as he was in life.
Countless hordes still worship in his name.
- Well, come on, let's go to work.
- Righto.
You know, I have a feeling that the sooner we get these relics in the hands of Sir Nayland, the sooner we'll have news of your father, Sheila.
Look out, Terry.
Oh, that's all right, darling.
Just a friendly little tarantula.
I have brought you here for great tidings.
I am the most unfortunate of men.
I have no son to follow me.
Therefore, in shame, I ask you to receive a message from my ugly and insignificant daughter.
Speak, my daughter.
I have seen a vision.
The prophecy is about to be fulfilled.
Genghis Khan, masked in his plate of gold, bearing the scimitar that none but he could ever wield comes back to us.
I've seen a vision of countless hordes swarming to recapture the world.
I've seen the victorious.
I've heard the shouts of the dead and the dying drowned by the victorious cries of our people,
"Genghis Khan comes back.
"Genghis Khan leads the
East against the world! "
- Well, Mac.
- Well, it's my old friend Smith.
Nayland! This is a surprise.
- Sir Nayland!
- Hello, Terry.
- He's looking fine, isn't he?
- Yes.
Oh, Nayland. What of my father?
We'll talk about that later, Sheila.
Take her in the house, Terrence.
- Wait a minute, darling. I'll strike a light.
- No, no, don't. Don't do that.
Bring all that stuff in here as quietly as you can and stow it over there.
Oh, Nayland, please, please.
Tell me about my father.
Nothing. Nothing yet.
Pretty inadequate report, isn't it, Sheila?
- What are we going to do?
- I'm doing everything I can.
We can't find Fu Manchu, although we do know he's around here and very near.
So if I can get all of you and this stuff out of the country, then I can deal with him. He'll show his hands.
Well, look, Nayland, if you think he's around here, why do we have to leave the country until we find him?
Young man, your business is to obey orders.
And I'll have you all out of the country by tomorrow,
- every one of you.
- Oh, why?
Because I'm worried. I don't like the looks of it.
Why can't we have a little light, Nayland?
Because this house has got to appear empty as it has been for months.
It's our only safety.
- So understand. No lights.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Miss Sheila, off to bed with you.
Come along and I'll show you where your room is.
They all open off this courtyard, and yours is here.
So, this is what we've been fighting for.
- Aye. That's what we came for.
- Yeah, that's it.
And they believe in a bauble like that.
Will we ever understand these Eastern races?
Will we ever learn anything?
Well, we'll have to take turns watching this thing tonight.
McLeod, you take the first four hours.
No, I'll stay up all night. Then
I'll know everything's all right.
All right.
- But I'm going to lock you in.
- Aye.
- Good night, Mac.
- Good night.
Terrence, open the door.
- Good night, McLeod.
- Good night, Smith.
Terry!
McLeod.
Mac.
What's happened?
He was black.
Black.
But he didn't take it.
He didn't...
For as much as the Almighty
God with his great mercy hath taken unto himself the soul of our dear brother here departed, we therefore commit his body to the ground.
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Amen.
Amen.
I don't want to be abrupt, but we've got to get down to brass tacks.
Now, understand, no one leaves this compound today.
You travel tonight.
But we've been traveling for days without rest.
- We can't do it, Nayland.
- You must.
So, Sheila, you go to your room and sleep until I call you.
Have no fear. We're watching over you.
You get all the sleep you can.
Von Berg, you better get some rest also. Terry, you take the first watch.
Bolt that door, Terry.
See here, Nayland, we're done in. Exhausted.
We can't go tonight.
Why, think of Sheila.
She's the one I am thinking of.
Do you suppose for a moment
Fu Manchu doesn't know we have a beautiful white girl here with us?
He wants the sword and mask. Suppose he takes them?
- Suppose he takes Sheila also?
- I hadn't thought of that.
We're in the enemy's country now. And a wise enemy.
We're fighting a thing we can't understand with everything against us.
That's why you've got to get Sheila and those relics
- into a place of safety tonight.
- I understand.
- You really think he knows about Sheila?
- He knows everything.
He knows every move we make.
His spies are all around us.
I can't even trust our own coolies.
Someone's watching us. I can feel it.
Now, just pull yourself together, laddie.
Pull yourself together.
Got a revolver?
- Yes.
- Good.
I'll go out and look over the camels and pick out the ones
I think are fit to make the dash tonight.
Don't you go in that tower room. I'll be back in a moment.
- Cheerio.
- Cheerio.
- Good afternoon, my friend.
- Well?
A message from my master, Dr. Fu Manchu.
I just want to know one thing. Is Sir Lionel alive?
But what makes you think not?
- Does that mean that he's dead?
- But of course not.
My master's quite excelled at surgery, and a little accident...
What's your message?
My master would very much like a certain sword and mask.
I don't think so.
Your fiancée is very fond of her father, I believe.
- I'm thinking about that.
- Terry!
- What is it?
- Nothing.
Is it nothing to know that your father is well?
- Oh, where is he?
- Fu Manchu's got him.
No! Is he all right?
Look out, Terry. This may be a trick.
There is unfortunately a certain amount of evidence to the contrary.
Oh, it's not your father's. It's a cheap trick to try to scare us.
- Perhaps you would like other evidence.
- No. That's enough.
Terry, wait.
I shall expect to see you with the sword and mask
- at the shop of Goy Lo Sung.
- Where is that?
In the street of the dragon, half a league to the north.
Otherwise, I'm afraid if your father does return, he may not be in the best of health.
- Where are those things?
- Oh, Sheila, we can't.
- Where are they?
- Wait a minute, dear.
Don't you see it's betraying the whole expedition?
- I'm going to that place.
- Oh, you couldn't. You can't.
Oh, Terry, don't you see?
If it were someone you loved. My father, who'd do anything for you.
- I know, dear. But listen to...
- Terry, if you won't go, I'll go myself.
You can't let them do this to him. You can't let him suffer.
We'll get the sword back somehow. Nayland will manage.
Nayland would do this himself. Anyone would.
You mustn't say a word to Nayland.
- But you are going?
- Yes.
- You're Fu Manchu?
- Please sit down so that we can enjoy your visit.
Now, tell me.
What can one so poor as
Dr. Fu Manchu do for you?
You know why I'm here.
This is the sword and mask of Genghis Khan.
Your messenger said that if I brought you these, you'd release Sir Lionel.
Release? Why, my dear young friend,
Sir Lionel is my guest, not my prisoner.
But if I could see the sword and mask.
Genghis Khan.
What are you going to do?
No.
- You trick Fu Manchu?
- That's the sword we found in the tomb.
Lies, you cursed son of a white dog! I'll flay you for this!
I tell you, I didn't know. Those relics were found in the tomb.
- The whips!
- Listen to me!
I tell you, I didn't know that sword was a fake.
I swear to you I didn't.
The whips!
Faster! Faster!
Faster! Faster!
Faster! Faster!
Let him down.
Untie him.
Follow me.
He is not entirely unhandsome, is he, my father?
For a white man, no.
May I suggest, however, a slight delay in your customary procedure?
- You have further need of him?
- I have.
He shall still be the means of discovering for me where they have hidden the sword and mask.
And for that purpose
- you will...
- Precisely.
I can't stand this. I don't see why they're not here.
- Patience, my dear. We must wait.
- I won't wait. I can't.
I can't imagine where Terry's gone.
Sheila, you sure you don't know?
I've told you I don't know.
- I don't believe you.
- Nayland.
I'm sorry, Sheila, but why don't you tell me the truth?
I can't.
No! Let me go to him.
My father. Let me go!
No! No, let me go.
I gave her enough of this so she'll sleep till morning.
She should have told me.
- I might have saved her father.
- Why did Fu kill him?
Reprisal.
He found out that the other sword was a counterfeit.
- It was a fake?
- Yes.
I had it made from an old engraving
I found in the British Museum.
That's why I left at a later date.
I intended to use those relics to buy Sir Lionel from Fu Manchu.
- I would have brought him back alive.
- What will he do to Terry?
Nothing, just now.
He realizes that I have the genuine sword.
You changed them the night McLeod was killed.
Yes.
Sheila said that Terry had gone to the Bazaar of Goy Lo Sung.
As I remember, that's the sing-song shop in a place known as the House of Ten Thousand Joys.
- You are going there?
- Yes.
I'm sure that it leads to Fu Manchu.
And, Von Berg, if I don't return in 24 hours, you take that mask and sword and Sheila to Peking.
And don't come looking for me.
And don't pay any attention to anything you hear about me or from me till I get back.
And don't you let her out of your sight.
I understand. Good luck, my friend.
I'm going to need it if I meet Fu Manchu.
See something? Here.
Here.
Ming Dynasty.
Ming. Ming.
- Too small.
- Small?
More big? I get.
No.
What I really want is a little comfort. A little rest.
Pleasant dreams, perhaps?
No. No can do. Not for white man.
Understand. Honorable.
Follow me. Come.
Come.
Come.
Nice bed, sir.
Waiter.
You can load? Nicely dream.
The slightest move will send a bullet crashing through your stiff British spine.
Are you in the habit of shooting your enemies in the back?
Put your gun away.
You may turn around.
Now, that's better.
Now we can talk like gentlemen.
- Now, what do you want?
- You know what I want.
I want Terry Granville, and I want him alive.
- Really?
- Where is he?
At the moment, he's being entertained by my beautiful daughter.
Rot!
Would you like to see him? Talk to him?
- Yes.
- Permit me.
Is this a friend of your family's?
It's not wise to insult your host, Sir Nayland.
If it were not the easy way out, I would kill you now.
If you please.
No. Permit me.
My most modest daughter.
Sir Nayland Smith of the
British Secret Service.
- Terry, Terry.
- Nayland.
- What have you done to this boy?
- Practically nothing, as yet.
What are you going to do to him?
Merely inject a drop of serum into his blood.
- That will either kill him or drive him mad?
- Neither.
The injection of the serum will make his brain mine.
In other words, he becomes a reflection of my will.
He will do as I command exactly as though I were doing it.
- So much better than hypnotism.
- I see.
Another of your Oriental tricks.
In the name of the British government,
I demand the release of this boy.
British government?
I will wipe them and the whole accursed white race off the face of the earth when I get the sword and mask that will call the teaming millions of Asia to the uprising.
- And he will bring them to me.
- You'll never make him do that.
Wait and see.
Why, my dear Sir Nayland Smith,
I will show you the sword myself just before I dispatch you to your cold, saintly Christian paradise.
See that he is quite comfortable, for the present.
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
- I'm not afraid of your poisons.
- Not poison.
This serum, distilled from dragon's blood, my own blood, the organs of different reptiles, and mixed with the magic brew of the sacred seven herbs, will temporarily change you into the living instrument of my will.
You will do as I command.
I am only going to give you the very smallest amount which will pass off in a short time, because I want you to be your very self when I hand you over to my gentle daughter.
You will think as I think, see as I see, and do as I command.
Doctor!
Dr. Von Berg.
Dr. Von Berg.
- Who is it?
- It's I, Terrence. Open the door.
Come in.
Oh, Terry.
Terry, my darling, I thought you were never coming back.
What have they done to you? You look so tired.
I'm all right. I'm all right.
I'm back. I'm here.
Terry, dear, you seem dazed, as if you'd been drugged.
Terry.
What?
Where's Sir Nayland? What about him?
He's all right. He's waiting for us in Nankow.
- Nankow?
- But you must get into bed, Terry.
- You need sleep, dear.
- No.
No, we must leave at once.
He's waiting for us.
- He wants us to bring the mask and sword.
- He? Who? You mean Nayland?
Yes. Yes, he's taking us to Peking. Tonight.
Oh, that's impossible. He would never leave in this storm.
He says we must leave.
He says the storm gives us our best chance.
But, Terry, why didn't
Nayland come with you?
- Yes, he told us to wait.
- He's preparing a secret escort to Peking.
That's why he sent me.
He says we're to bring only the mask and sword.
Well, he must know what he's doing.
Sheila, you go and get dressed.
- We leave at once.
- No.
Close that door. Keep Terry here.
I can't explain it,
- but there's something I'm afraid of.
- Afraid of what?
I don't know. This just isn't Terry.
Of course it's Terry.
Come on, get dressed,
Sheila. Come on, Terry.
Terry. Hold it, listen to me.
You're not yourself.
I know you're not.
Oh, please, don't go tonight, I beg of you. Wait until morning.
- He can't wait. Come on.
- No.
- No, Terry. I'm afraid of you.
- Come on.
I don't understand. Terry. I'm afraid. I don't understand you, Terry.
You're all changed. Please, I'm not going. I tell you, I won't go.
Come on, Terry.
He wants you, Terry. Go on.
He's waiting for you. Go on.
- There it is.
- Give it to me.
Oh, don't.
- Stop.
- Yeah.
Doctor.
Doctor!
Terry.
Look, Sheila, that isn't Terry.
- It's an evil spirit.
- He's possessed. Possessed.
Fu Manchu, I want to tell you that the British government...
Silence!
It is my pleasure to show you how I entertain my guests.
You, Miss Barton, will be taken to the room of the golden peacock, where you will be prepared for a sacrifice to our Gods.
And you... You, my dear
Doctor, will follow my slaves to the room of the slim silver fingers, where I am sure you will be more than comfortable.
And at sunrise tomorrow, as my chieftains are assembled in the temple below, you two and your compatriot,
Sir Nayland Smith, will have the pleasure of entering your Christian heaven together.
It will be your honor to be the first white martyrs to perish at the hands of the new Genghis Khan.
I congratulate you.
Listen, you...
Terrence, do something. Help,
Sheila. Help! Do something.
You hideous yellow monster.
You've got your cursed sword and mask. What more can you want of us?
- Do you want to destroy us all?
- Yes.
This is only the beginning. I will wipe out your whole accursed white race.
Oh, no. Terry!
Terry. Look at me. Listen to me.
It's Sheila. It's
Sheila talking to you.
I love you, Terry. You've been sick.
You've been through a bad dream. A bad dream, Terry.
But you're going to waken.
You're going to waken now.
My darling, they can't hurt you.
You belong to me. You're mine. I love you, Terry.
Put your arms around me. Put your arms around me, Terry.
Darling.
Sheila, Sheila.
Sheila.
You silly little fool. Lying to yourself. Believing that you had his love, when he was only drugged by this beast!
- You failed. Both of you.
- Take them away.
You... Listen, Sheila, I know what they did to me.
I love you. Always remember that. I love you.
At the third stroke of the gong, have the slaves take her to the temple.
- Great honor is yours, Miss Barton.
- I am ready.
Oh, my child, you must not be impatient.
Great as I am about to become,
I still cannot hasten the course of the sun.
- Will it be soon?
- Very soon.
From here I shall go to the altar, where, if the Gods are good, the divine image of Genghis Khan will hand me his sword as a sign that I am his true successor.
And am I to be allowed to see my friends again?
I am afraid you would not entirely enjoy what you saw.
- Is Terrence...
- It seems that my daughter has conceived a romantic interest in this young man.
She's having him taken to the laboratory to await further injections of that interesting serum, which, as you may have noticed, will make him her more-than-willing slave, until, of course, she tires of him.
Men of Asia, our skies are red with the thunderbolts of Genghis Khan.
They rain down on the white race and burn them.
The sacrifice to our Gods!
Would you all have maidens like this for your wives?
- Yes!
- Yes!
Then conquer and breed.
Kill the white man and take his women.
Give us the sign!
Our war eagles scream.
The splendor of the world is yours.
Here it is, and that's the machine.
See what's beneath it.
Von Berg, this should send out a million volts.
It will. I saw it.
Terry, you hurry. Get to Sheila.
We'll cover you with this.
In the blood of Shiva's bride,
I baptize this sword.
Are you sure it's necessary, Nayland?
Father would so much have wanted to have it in the museum.
I'm very sorry, my dear.
As much as I respect your father's memory, we can't afford to take any chances.
There may be other Fu
Manchus in the future.
By golly, after all that's happened,
I wouldn't be surprised to see the hand of that fellow Fu Manchu get out of the ocean and grab it.
I don't think there's much danger of that.
Well, Genghis Khan, wherever you are, here's your...
Did you hear it?
Dinner is served. Dinner is served.
- Good evening.
- Good evening, sir.
You aren't, by any chance, a doctor of philosophy?
Law?
- Medicine?
- I don't think so, sir.
But are you sure?
Oh, yes, very sure.
- I congratulate you.
- Thank you.
Dinner is served. Dinner is served.
Well, as I was saying, wherever you are, Genghis Khan,
I give you back your sword.
Well, my friend, this is an unexpected pleasure.
- Come in.
- Thank you.
How do you do?
I wouldn't disturb you, but the friend I spoke to you about... is leaving town tomorrow to supervise some new excavations in Egypt.
He was most anxious to see your collection before going away.
- May I present Mr. Galatalin.
- Why, this is a great pleasure.
I've heard so much about you.
How do you do?
Follow me, gentlemen.
My children would become conceited that so distinguished a critic... has thought them interesting enough to review.
Splendid.
Joan of Arc. Beautiful.
It's a pity to race through such an exhibition.
And here is Voltaire.
One might almost expect him to speak.
I wonder what he'd say after all these years.
You would be astonished.
He is more difficult now, to those in authority, than even the records show.
He is a very stubborn person, I assure you.
- Stubborn?
- Unbelievably.
For days I argued with this fellow... before getting him just as I wanted.
But always, I triumphed.
And few people triumphed over Monsieur Voltaire.
And here, gentlemen....
Here is something that pleases me... although of no historic importance.
It was done because
I love to model children.
Note, gentlemen, the line of the shoulder and--
You have no right to hide such genius in a side-street museum.
You are very gracious.
These things have some merit,
I suspect, but this....
Will you come this way, gentlemen, please?
This, I'm convinced, is fine.
- Marie Antoinette?
- Yes, sir.
Beautiful composition.
Even those delicate veins and the texture of that flesh.
I never saw anything more exquisite.
But, tell me, where did you begin to model in wax?
In my native country, at first, as a hobby.
- He has a great reputation as a sculptor.
- You are very kind, sir.
However, I was commissioned to come to England... and with the completion of my work,
I turned my mind to these... because it seemed to satisfy me more.
I felt I could reproduce the warmth and flesh and blood of life... far more better in wax than in cold stone.
If you will grant me the privilege...
I'd like to submit your work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
Royal--
You will have won the undying gratitude of all of us.
Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
I regret that I have not the time to give to your exhibition now... but I'll worry you more when I get back.
It will always afford me the greatest pleasure to welcome you.
I must apologize again for coming and disturbing you at this late hour.
It was a great pleasure, I assure you.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.
- And I'm very grateful to you.
- Not at all.
Thank you for your visit and your encouragement.
- Good night, lvan.
- Good night.
My masterpiece, my Marie Antoinette.
You heard what this man, who is very celebrated, said of you?
Yes, of course. You would say that.
You always told me so, of course.
Hello, there!
Hello.
What are you doing here so late?
I came for some books. I'm trying to straighten out the accounts.
I don't hope to impress you but we haven't a farthing.
That is unfortunate.
You're right, it's unfortunate.
*15,000 it's cost me, and you say it's unfortunate... as though I spilled soup on my vest.
Your money may be very well invested, one never knows.
Something important may come of all this.
Something has got to come of all this.
- The rent on this place isn't paid.
- ls that a fact?
No, I'm lying to amuse myself.
Now, look here. I have an idea that will get us out of all this.
You and I have absolutely no money, but we have got this.
- Fire insurance.
- Yes, insurance. That's our way out.
You know that a fire in this place will give us *10,000?
A fire?
Is this your idea of humor, my friend?
I want the money back that I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
You're asking to burn these people?
- You are asking to destroy all--
- I'm not asking you.
- I'm telling you.
- You think I'll permit this?
You've got to permit it.
Whose fault is it if people don't come here?
Yours. All this artistic nonsense.
The museum at Walston Lane does well enough.
And why? Because they have
Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare... the Mad Butcher... the Demon Barber of Fleet Street, things that people pay to see!
And they are welcome to them.
To perpetuate such scoundrels is to celebrate their crimes.
What do think I'm in this for?
A match. A cigar stub, even... and you and I have *10,000 to divide between us.
You are insane.
No, I'm not insane. Not at all.
Let me show you how easily it can be done.
Wait, you!
Anything new, Doc?
Nothing we didn't tell you this afternoon.
The coroner confirmed our opinion.
It was suicide.
Gee, that'll make a swell story. Come on.
Hello, is that you, Tim?
I'm sorry, but I've got to have that tonight.
I've got to have it.
No, I tell you, I need it right away.
Who's on the gate down there?
Joe? Then you can get it out, all right.
I'll send a truck right down there.
The harness bull's okay.
I straightened it out this afternoon.
New Year's Eve ain't what it used to be.
This is only the second one tonight.
Times sure are tough.
What happened to this one?
Husband slapped her full of lumps.
Said she talked too much.
What's that?
Embalming fluid. It makes them jump.
Ain't that just like a woman?
Always has to have the last word.
As I live and breath and wear spats, the prince.
You've been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
Where did you get that news item?
From a little bird?
Have a pleasant vacation?
Charming. More delightful people crippled.
That's fine.
Consider yourself crippled financially.
See if you can jar your friends loose for enough to eat.
Meaning what?
You're a sure bet to place in the bread line.
There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental.
You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.
Is mama's dumpling getting tough?
I'm through clowning, Florence.
You're all washed up. Get out!
What do you mean? It's New Year's!
We still get out a newspaper.
Ever thought of that?
- ls it my fault if nothing happens?
- What do you mean, nothing happens?
Look down there!
Out of that insane mob, you say nothing happens?
There's a story in every person down there.
Do I circulate among them and say
"Would you tell me the story of your life?"
Getting newspaper stories is none of our business.
You're through. Get out.
Go on, get out.
You're fired unless you bring a story for the next edition!
Even if it's only a new recipe for spaghetti!
I thought I told you to keep out of here.
I won't bother you, but I'm all in.
My nerves are all shot.
Your nerves aren't the only things that'll be shot.
You've been smoking again.
Give him a bag.
Thanks.
Come on.
And understand this... you get nothing until you show me something.
The next time you talk out of turn you'll have bad luck.
- Understand?
- Thanks.
Happy New Year!
Hey, Miss Dempsey.
Wonder how they'll settle the heavyweight argument while you're around.
Hello, sweetheart. How's your sex life?
So you're in again.
Hey, Jim, call out the riot squad.
- How's every little old thing?
- Fine.
You're the first reporter here in two hours.
- You people been seeing the old year out?
- I'm people which the old year saw out.
- I'm fired.
- No kidding.
I gotta make news if I have to bite a dog.
Hey, Kelly.
Oh, my gosh, even he walked out on me.
I've got a story for you.
You know the Joan Gale girl?
She committed suicide yesterday.
I read about it last year.
Yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide.
- She may have been murdered.
- No kidding? Any suspects?
- You know George Winton?
- Old Howard Winton's cub?
- That's him.
- They don't suspect him?
Don't they?
He's down at the Tombs right now.
- lf you're stringing me, old timer....
- Why should l?
- They were sweeties till last month.
- What does that prove?
Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him.
You know, such things have happened.
Anyway, he was in her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.
- Saved, one job.
- The press room for yours.
- Wait till I give you the rest of the dirt.
- Make it snappy.
They've ordered an autopsy over at Bellevue immediately. Go there.
- Don't give this to anyone else.
- It's yours.
Thanks!
Fresh kid!
- Feeling tough?
- Rotten.
]That's too bad, sister.
I have a case of jitters that will cop the Pulitzer Prize.
If they don't hurry up, they'll have another corpse on their hands.
Bring in number seven. The Gale girl.
She's a very interesting case.
When I was called, the girl had been dead for possibly three or four hours.
My examination clearly showed that she died of laudanum poisoning.
I thought at first it might have been an accident. An overdose.
Her eyes indicated that she used narcotics frequently.
- What was the police theory?
- Suicide.
- Leave any message?
- No.
That's why I thought it was an accident.
- Are you in charge of the case?
- Yes, sir.
Who got the information about Winton?
Everyone knew they were living together.
But he was playing around with some other twist.
Winton was in bad though because he left before she folded up.
If she committed suicide with laudanum she probably took it in its true form... and we'll find it in that or very close to that state.
If someone gave it to her, it would be diluted.
- But how could he give it to her?
- ln a cup of coffee or a glass of whiskey.
- That's possible.
- The Gale body is gone.
- What are you talking about?
- Absurd!
What do you mean? The body is gone?
Just that. It's vanished.
Gone. Disappeared.
You mean to say someone stole the body?
We found the slab empty and the window to the alley was open.
Come on.
Boy, and he asked for a story.
Is his face red!
Bryant, 2626.
- Hello.
- Hello, slug.
Kill that Winton story for this.
Joan Gale's body was....
Not John Brown's.
Joan Gale's body was snatched from the morgue two minutes ago.
I'm here now.
Yeah, there were nine or ten witnesses.
No, they didn't talk. They're pretty stiff.
No, dope, not drunk. Dead.
Get out of the Tombs and get to Winton.
I'll have Harry write the first flash.
A cow does that, and gives milk besides.
Send Harry in.
- How do you do? I'm from the Express.
- Yeah?
I don't want to talk to you.
I know you people. You'll try to crucify me for something I didn't do.
Anything you print about me, you've got to prove.
You know you're innocent till you're proven guilty.
That's fine.
But while I'm proving my innocence... you people will uncover every petty kid trick I ever did.
You'll write editorials about every cocktail I drank.
Anything that any normal person might have done... will have a sinister meaning if I did it.
It'll be a lot easier if you come clean.
Let's get down to cases.
- When did you see this girl last?
- ln the afternoon before--
- Why didn't you tell that to the police?
- They didn't give me a chance.
We had a couple of drinks.
She was all right. She seemed happy.
Do you remember what she said?
What did you talk about?
She laughed and she said we were being very silly... that we didn't care for each other anymore but we needn't hate each other.
- Said she wanted us to be friends.
- Was that all?
No. We planned a trip.
I was sending her to Bermuda.
- You weren't going with her?
- No.
- Why didn't I take her away somewhere?
- Let's get back to the case in hand.
They ordered an autopsy and found her body had been stolen.
No.
What are you trying to do to me?
- You're working with the police--
- I'm trying to help you... if you're on the square and I think you are.
- Why are you telling me a crazy lie, then?
- That happens to be the truth.
- But who'd steal her body?
- That's what they'll ask you.
- Come on, time's up.
- Be right with you.
Keep a stiff upper lip, kid.
I think you'll come out okay.
Go ahead, I'm listening.
The whole thing sounded on the up and up to me.
Poor guy's too scared to lie.
I think he's getting a raw deal.
Ain't that a shame.
Nice little chap, wouldn't harm a fly.
Everyone picking on the poor little fellow.
If he was unknown, they wouldn't have pinched him.
He's George Winton and they're playing it up.
It's a Roman holiday for every editor in New York.
Why the goose pimples?
If he was someone like me, you'd be trying to hang him.
I wouldn't be trying, beloved,
I would hang him.
All that gaga about that body disappearing....
Eight bodies have been stolen in New York in the last 18 months.
Isn't it more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
And ruin a perfectly good story?
Don't be silly.
I think this kid's entitled to a break.
- He's getting it. He's front page.
- You give me a pain.
I'm glad to hear it.
Since when did you start crusading for justice?
This mug with all the money has had two or three nasty affairs.
He's kept out of print, because his grandfather was smart.
He couldn't have stolen the body from jail.
Don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself, do you?
I hope they give him the works.
Even if he didn't kill her, he's responsible for her death... and they can fry him any time without making me sore.
- I won't work on it from that angle.
- You won't?
You were pretty tough about
Judge Ramsey, a while ago.
They didn't prove anything against him.
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
Or was killed by someone afraid of him.
- He took a run-out powder.
- That's got nothing to do with this case.
- Can I handle this my way?
- You cannot.
I'm still editor of this newspaper.
You said I was fired. Well, I quit!
- Give the assignment to somebody else.
- Wait a minute.
No, I'm through!
Come here, sob sister.
All right. Go ahead.
Do it your own way.
On the square, if you'd seen that kid down there...
I'm not holding for him, maybe he is a dirty pup, but he's scared... and so kind of dumb and worthless.
If he is, we'll give him away as a bridge prize.
Come on, beat it.
It's 5:. 00. You need some sleep.
- There's another point.
- Sleep on it. We'll get it tomorrow.
Here's your portrait.
- Which one is me? The horse?
- Get out of here.
If my curiosity is not too great... would you mind telling me what animal you are designing?
One of the Athenian girls for the bacchanal.
It would be interesting to know where and when you studied anatomy.
It doesn't seem so bad to me.
What is wrong with it?
Anatomy.
Heaven forgive you.
You must have studied with a sideshow of .
I'm sorry, sir. I'll change it.
The reason I wanted to work with you was to learn about that.
And this fellow.
Look what this cobbler is doing.
What is this?
Are you so beautiful that you make everything in your own likeness?
It's a mercy of Providence that this fellow cannot hear.
Anatomy.
A great sculptor.
And I am barred.
Look.
Look at these claws.
If I had those hands of yours...
I would show you the meaning of what you are trying to do.
All those beautiful things that were destroyed...
I could restore.
It is a cruel irony that you people without souls... should have hands.
But go on, go back to work.
It is useless and hopeless to talk to such people.
Who is it?
Got it? Is it completed?
Yes, sir, it's ready, but it's pretty heavy and I'll need help.
Come in here. Help Professor Darcy.
And hurry.
The figure has yet to be mounted and dressed.
And now, my friend, you are to see something... that one truly can describe as art.
Professor Darcy doesn't try to keep freedom and sketchiness in his work.
He is an artist.
His figures are realistic, lifelike.
He works at home, hours when such people as you are loafing.
- Shall we open it?
- Yes.
Exquisite. Almost as beautiful as the original.
Someday I hope to have you restore
Marie Antoinette.
I'd be glad to, Mr. Igor.
Take her in. Dress her for the opening.
I think I'll have something to tell you soon.
You have done well, and I too have something for you.
Thanks.
Hello?
Hello! I was just thinking about you.
Yeah, I was, too.
No, I haven't forgotten.
I won't have much time, we'll have to eat someplace close.
Let's go to that little Bohemian place.
- All right, I'll meet you in the lobby.
- At 12:00.
Bye.
Who was it? Penny ante?
- Why?
- I just wondered.
Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
I don't want to offend you but it's none of your business.
- I don't interfere in any of your affairs.
- I don't have any affairs.
- What do you mean?
- I don't think you could have a real affair.
I don't think you could care for anyone.
I've been in love so many times, my heart's calloused.
But I never had one with dough.
This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
I don't agree with you.
All right, you raise the kids,
I'll raise the roof.
I'd rather die shaking cocktails and bankers... than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
Would you?
He can look like a gorilla and have no manners... but he must have dough, plenty of dough.
You think money is the only requisite.
It just happens that the poor people are happier.
Then marry Ralph.
You'll be the happiest couple in the world.
I wish you wouldn't be so sarcastic about him.
He's the sweetest kid I know.
What are you laughing at?
I just imagined you telling a landlady some day... you didn't have the rent, but Ralph was awfully sweet.
I haven't noticed any multi-millionaires running after you.
I met one last night.
All the money this side of Peoria.
- Did you? Where?
- ln the can.
The hoosegow! Mrs. Winton's little boy, of the Park Avenue Wintons.
- Discharge?
- Yeah.
How are you, Mr. Winton?
When I say I'm happier to see you than I ever was to see anyone... it comes from the heart.
- How are you, Mr. Gates?
- Splendid, my boy.
- What have you been up to?
- Not a thing.
- I hope your father accepts that.
- ls Dad here?
No. We talked to him long distance today.
- Was he pretty sore?
- He wasn't exactly overjoyed.
What did he say?
He said to get you out of trouble, then hire someone to punch your head off.
- Have you had lunch?
- No.
Come on, we'll get something to eat.
- Hello, Florence, how are you?
- Fine. Thanks.
I'm awfully sorry,
I've got to disappoint you.
Don't worry. She'll get used to it.
Disappoint me? Why?
I won't be able to go to lunch with you.
What's happened?
The old man is awfully anxious to open on schedule.
All of the advertising announced it for tonight.
What are you doing here?
There are no visitors allowed.
- You'll have to leave.
- I'm from the Express.
I don't care where you're from.
I said, "No visitors allowed."
You might get some good publicity, if you'll--
We're opening tonight.
You shall have the pleasure then.
You don't understand, if you....
Ralph.
Are you going to stay out there all day?
The old man's pretty peppery.
I'll see you tonight.
All right.
I'm awfully sorry.
I was just explaining about....
- What's the matter, sir?
- Nothing at all, my boy.
I should like to meet your friend.
Why, certainly, sir.
Charlotte, Mr. Igor wants to meet you.
Why, certainly.
Mr. Igor, may I present my fiancée,
Miss Duncan.
- Charlotte, Mr. Igor.
- I'm delighted to meet you.
- Professor Darcy.
- How do you do?
If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear...
I am very happy to know you.
You'd be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born.
Before this terrible thing happened to me...
I made a very beautiful statue.
And, my child... you are that figure come to life.
How?
I wonder, sometime, would you pose for one of my sculptors... who does really excellent work?
Why, yes, I'd love to.
Thank you.
...see you tonight at the opening.
- Of course, I plan to come.
- You'd be welcome at any time.
I crave nourishment.
Come on, moonstruck. Let's get going.
So long, see you in jail.
- Good-bye, Mr. Igor.
- Good-bye. I'll see you tonight.
I assume I shall have the privilege of having her pose for me.
- That was my plan.
- Thank you.
I'm going to leave you.
I've got to get to the office.
- But what about lunch?
- I'll have it for supper.
Hello, light of my life!
Well, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
Dig into the morgue and send up all the art you have on Joan Gale.
Why so mysterious? Spill it.
So you can tell me I'm wrong?
Don't be silly.
- Thanks.
- Okay.
I am right! I know I'm right.
No one would suspect it.
You don't sound right.
If you wisecrack while I'm talking,
I'll crown you.
Go ahead, wise guy. Spill it.
There's a wax museum opening on 14th Street.
Don't that call for an extra.
I asked you to keep it shut.
You can't blame a guy for getting breathless with that scoop.
You poor baboon, you can guess the rest.
Wait a minute.
No kidding. What's your idea?
I got a look at that dump a while ago... and if they don't have a wax figure of Joan Gale, then I'm crazy.
- We'll grant that.
- What?
What of it? Where do we go from there?
Does this mean anything to you?
Joan Gale's body was swiped from the morgue.
Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
I used to be married to one.
And it came to life and divorced you.
I know that.
My idea is this: Somebody swipes the body, takes the impression... makes a mold, produces a wax figure, peddles it to the old skate there.
Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
- You go to....
- What's that?
Let it go.
Come down to earth.
Would they dare to do that?
Wouldn't they know it would be recognized?
Shake your head, you'll be all right.
All right, mastermind.
Something's cockeyed about that joint,
I'll find out what.
By the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.
- What?
- That innocent Judge Ramsey... that you were sure got bumped off, has been located in South America.
- No kidding?
- Almost certain.
I'll still bet I'm right, and let you write your own ticket.
- That settles everything.
- Yup, everything settled.
Good.
- I'm glad they didn't hold you.
- There's no case against me.
A clumsy thing, but nothing to worry about.
- lf I can do anything for you....
- I know I can always depend on you.
- What do you think is the best time?
- I'll let you know.
- So long.
- See you later.
- I hope, soon.
- Good-bye.
Hello?
Don't swoon. This is the voice of the New York Express broadcasting.
I'm awful glad you phoned.
Thank you for trying to cheer me up last night.
If you're grateful, you can prove it.
And do yourself a good turn too.
About 8:30 p. m., you be in your car at....
Good evening.
The history of these figures becomes more interesting, perhaps... when I tell you that the originals were destroyed... twelve years ago, in London, in a fire... and were reproduced only after years of arduous toil.
To reproduce the figures destroyed,
I had to train men for years... to do the work that I could no longer do.
The results, you see here tonight.
Ladies and gentlemen, here is one of the classic examples of chivalry.
Sir Walter Raleigh, spreading his cloak in the mud... so that Queen Elizabeth might walk dry-shod.
This group represents
His Royal Highness, Le Duc D'Angouleme...
Ieader of the French nobility... praying before the remains of the victims of the Battle of Quiberon.
And next, we see the ill-starred Maximilian... established as Emperor of Mexico by Napoleon lll.
Upon the conclusion of the American Civil War...
Napoleon withdrew his military support...
Ieaving Maximilian to the mercy of his rebellious subjects.
The figure lying in the bath is Marat... one of the most bloodthirsty leaders of the French Revolution.
He perished at the hands of his mistress Charlotte Corday... who was inspired to the deed by her fanatical devotion to her country.
This my friends, is Napoleon,
Emperor of the French... whose overwhelming ambition swept him to world power.
Here we see him after his banishment to St. Helena by the English.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, on the right here... we have a figure of Peter the Great.
- Hello, Ralph.
- Hello.
- Are we late?
- No.
- Pretty dress, have I seen it before?
- Yes, I think so.
- Thank goodness that's settled.
- Pay no attention to her.
I'm so excited to see all these things.
- Mr. Igor.
- Yes?
You're sure of that? You're quite sure?
- I'd know him anywhere.
- Keep track of him.
This is the most important thing of my life.
That'd be easy.
I wish....
- My little Marie Antoinette.
- Good evening, Mr. Igor.
- It's kind of you to be present.
- All these things are beautiful.
They are.
- Too bad the audience was so poor.
- I wouldn't be too disappointed, Mr. Igor.
The people are tired from the festivities.
My boy, I think you're right.
Everybody is tired out tonight.
And now that I've seen my doors open in a new country...
I begin to realize I'm a little tired myself.
- Call that fellow in, I'll close up for tonight.
- Yes, sir.
I might have felt a little discouraged.
But now, everything seems just as it should be.
You know, to find even one person who appreciates my beautiful children here...
- changes everything for me.
- I'm glad.
You're very beautiful.
Thank you.
You must come sometime in the morning when there is no crowd about... and I can give you more of my time.
Good evening, Mr. Igor.
I've just been admiring your works.
Properly lighted, they're even more impressive.
Yes. At first I despaired of ever achieving the same results I did abroad... and then lighting came to my rescue.
I was particularly interested in that group.
Yes, that one is very fine. Its grim tragedy seems to fascinate everyone.
- Yes, and that other one, that Joan of Arc.
- That was the most recently completed.
- lt arrived this morning.
- You did that yourself?
No. Never since these hands were burned have I created anything.
- I only direct the work of others.
- Who did it?
Professor Darcy.
- He has been my hands for years.
- You are very generous, Mr. Igor.
But I don't deserve any credit.
I only carried out your instructions.
Good night.
It's getting late. I better be going.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Shall we go?
- All right.
Thank you for coming.
Good night, my dear.
- Good night.
- Ready, Florence?
You two go without me. I've got a date.
No fouling in the clinches!
Winton!
Follow that man down the street!
And no questions.
We're on the trail of hot news.
- What's this all about?
- I might as well tell you.
That man is connected with the robbery at the morgue.
I don't want anything to do with this matter.
- Even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
- Not even then.
The police should handle this. If you've suspicions we'll go to the police.
And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story?
- Drive me around the corner and wait.
- I don't want to mix in this.
Then you can go to a warm place, and I don't mean California.
- All right. What do you want me to do?
- I told you what to do.
Drive out of sight of the house.
I want to get a closer look at the place.
That's nonsense.
- I figure you're yellow.
- No, I'm not.
- I feel that someone's been watching me.
- Nobody's watching you.
You're yellow and your nerves are shot.
I'll do nothing to help you until it's delivered.
- Get that through your head.
- All right.
- I'll phone.
- Not on this phone, you fool.
Go outside and call.
All right.
Well, buddy, what's the stall?
- I'm waiting for someone.
- Yeah, for who?
- I don't think it concerns you.
- Cut out the bluffing.
We've been following you, and you've done very suspicious things.
- Now, what are you doing here?
- What have I done?
You had a visitor at your apartment this afternoon.
Not the kind of a person
I'd expect you to entertain.
Winton!
- Hello, Express.
- I found the body!
- What are you talking about?
- The body of Joan Gale!
Trying to outsmart the police?
The body of Joan Gale is packed in the box in the basement!
- Are you giving me this straight?
- Take a look for yourself.
Let's take a look.
You, stop!
You cover the house, I'll get the other bird.
Come on.
Open this door.
Take it easy.
- It's down there in the basement.
- Wait a minute.
You boys go upstairs.
- It's not here, it's in the basement.
- Keep quiet.
Let's have a little light.
- See what's in there.
- Yes, sir.
Can you give me a description of this person you saw?
Not a very good one, I guess.
It wasn't like anything human.
It hobbled and swayed like a monkey.
And the face, from the glimpse I got of it was like an African war mask.
- You mean he was colored?
- I don't know.
But he made Frankenstein look like a lily!
- Nothing in there.
- ls there a rear entrance?
- I couldn't find any.
- Let's take a look.
Look, that's the basement.
- You find anything upstairs?
- Just a lot of paper and junk.
See if you can find a back entrance.
Let's take a look at the basement.
Just a minute, you.
- This is the place.
- Shut up!
Come out of there.
There's no one in here.
There he is now.
Turn on that light.
There it is. You'll find the body of Joan Gale in this box.
- Get that hatchet and open this.
- Yes, sir.
- I don't want to see it.
- Stay where you are.
What I wouldn't give for a slug of gin.
So that's your corpse?
Of all the things!
There's your corpse.
I've done nothing.
You've no right to arrest me!
- What's the charge against me?
- Shut up.
Here it is.
Come here.
Come on, spill it.
Who is it that owns this layout?
- I don't know.
- You don't know anything about it?
No, sir. I just know there was man named Worth.
- Worth?
- Yes, that was his name.
That's my bootlegger's name!
A heavyset fellow, with a broken nose?
Yes, that was the man.
I hope he delivered the stuff
I paid him for this afternoon.
I told you it was a bootlegger you saw at my place.
- Take this fellow in.
- I've done nothing.
- I even refused to deliver stuff for him.
- Come on, let's go.
Are you trying to give us the runaround here?
I want two of you boys to work the outside.
Don't let anybody in or out.
Florence, I don't want to leave her--
What're you doing? Put it back!
No, this is my percentage.
You guys are going to get yours.
I found this dump.
- Yeah.
- Whatever.
- Junkie?
- Yes, peddling.
Hold up your hands.
A classy turnip. Must have dipped it.
They tell me your managing editor is poison.
It takes a sturdy person to look at him.
The season's best catch is waiting.
I guess I'll breeze.
Wait a minute.
You want to talk to that junkie, Captain?
No, it's all right.
Lock him up. He'll talk soon.
- What do you think this is?
- What?
- Looks like a watch.
- Yes, but do you know whose watch?
- We don't know anything about it.
- Judge Ramsey's. That's all.
- Where did you get it?
- Took it off the junkie.
Well, I'll be....
- Bring him in. Here's your chance.
- Oh, boy!
Come in.
That yours?
Wait. Get me to the office and step on it.
- You like taking chances, don't you?
- Why?
- You go in for dangerous things.
- Darned if I don't!
Slow down!
I said the office, not the cemetery!
I never knew there were women like you in the world. You're game and decent.
And so determined to live that I'll take a taxi if you don't watch where you go.
I've only known you 24 hours, but I'm in love with you.
Doesn't usually take that long.
I forgive you.
You were in a tough spot when we met.
- No, I'm crazy about you.
- That's what caused it?
You don't believe me. You think
I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
- How much money have you got?
- Heaven knows. A lot.
That being the case, I'll take it up with the board of directors.
Listen, aviator. Here we are.
Hold everything, I'll be right back.
- Mitt me, kid. I've got a classic.
- You here again...
Iike an evil spirit to mar my happiness.
I've got a story, but I won't tell you what it is.
- Every time I tell you, it goes haywire.
- What do you mean?
You start out after murderers and bring back three-for-a-dime bootleggers.
You start out to solve murders and break up crap games.
You're stupendous. I'm for you.
You're wonderful.
You're always razzing everything I do, but this time I'm in.
Go on, girl. Tell your troubles to a cop.
I don't feel like talking.
Is there any art on Judge Ramsey?
Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
I'm gonna make you eat dirt, you soap bubble.
I'm gonna make you beg for somebody to help you let go!
You may be the world to your mother but you're a....
Let's get them some coffee, they've been in there with that junkie all night.
Go on, talk.
You found that watch in a taxicab three months ago. Is that right?
Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was laying there on the floor.
Where were you going when you got in that cab?
I don't remember. Not very far.
- You remember what day that was?
- No, sir. About three months ago.
- Remember what kind of a cab it was?
- No, sir, just a cab.
- Didn't happen to be going to Worth's?
- No, sir. I'm sure it wasn't there.
You used to go to Worth's place a lot.
What makes you sure it wasn't there?
Well, maybe, it was. I don't remember.
You've got to do something for me.
I can't stand it anymore.
I can't! Please.
He's beginning to break.
He'll talk pretty soon.
I think we got him, Chief.
He's been begging all night.
I never saw a junkie hold out so long.
Ralph?
I beg your pardon. Is Ralph here?
I was looking for Ralph.
No!
Mr. Igor, I'm so glad you're here.
I don't know why but I was a little bit afraid.
Afraid? Poor Hugo is quite harmless.
My little friend, you've honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
No, I wanted to speak to Ralph.
We had a silly little argument last night, and I said something unkind--
Oh, you children. You happy children.
You've quarreled, and now you'll be friends again.
That's exactly as it should be.
Never let any stupid misunderstanding come between you.
- lt was really all my fault.
- Let him think it was his fault.
You must be stern with him before you forgive him, especially if it was your fault.
Now I understand why he was so gloomy this morning.
- Then he's here?
- Yes, down in the workroom.
- I'll call him for you.
- No, please, don't bother.
- I think it'd be better if I surprise him.
- As you wish, my child.
- Just go straight ahead.
- All right, thanks.
Ralph?
Ralph, are you there?
What's the matter, my child?
Are you frightened?
I thought you said Ralph was here.
I came to tell you that I was mistaken.
I've sent Otto to find him.
I hope this little glimpse behind the scenes will interest you.
This is the birthplace of all my creations.
Let me show you.
I don't want to put you to the trouble, Mr. Igor.
No trouble at all, my child.
This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me.
To see others enjoy the beauty
I used to create.
- My footing is none too secure.
- Please, let me help you.
Help me, my dear... you'll help me to give back to the world... my masterpiece.
Marie Antoinette.
No!
Hey, you. Wait a minute.
- You can't park here. Get it out of here.
- Okay, brother.
- I have to park the car. I'll be right back.
- Make it snappy, I might need you.
- Hey, Ralph!
- Hello, Florence.
- Gee, am I glad to see you.
- First time you've said that.
- Have you got a key?
- I just came down to open up.
- What are you doing here?
- After news, as usual.
What are the chances for me to slip in and look around?
You better wait until the old man gets here.
I'll tell you a secret. I like the old gent.
I'm doing a special Sunday magazine--
- I don't think I can--
- lt might help him a whole lot.
The old man was depressed at the opening last night. This might cheer him up.
Hurry up.
Thanks.
All right. I'll talk. I'll tell you what I know!
Ramsey was murdered because he looked like Voltaire.
Do you hear?
Because he looked like Voltaire.
You want to know what became of him!
He's a statue. A silly wax statue.
You killed him!
Come on with the rest of it.
No, I did not.
It was lgor at the Wax Museum.
You were in on it. You worked for him.
The only thing I did was keep track of a man named Worth.
- He runs the place where you arrested me.
- You lie!
No. It was lgor at the Wax Museum.
You'll find your judge embalmed in wax!
He's a statue of Voltaire, with the other corpses!
I tell you, the whole place is a morgue.
Do you hear? A morgue.
My child, why are you so pitifully afraid?
Immortality has been the dream, the inspiration of mankind for ages.
I am going to give you immortality.
Please, I haven't done anything to hurt you.
I have no desire to hurt you.
You will always be beautiful.
Think, my child, in a thousand years, you will be as lovely as you are now.
- Come.
- No!
Let me go!
Your face... was of wax.
- You fiend.
- My Marie Antoinette.
- You must not say that to me.
- You fiend!
There was a fiend, of that you can be sure.
There was a fiend.
And this is what he did to me.
You did this.
For 12 years, 12 awful years... this terrible living dead man... with these burned hands and face has searched for the fiend.
Now the account is closed.
He is here!
Charlotte!
Don't be afraid, my dear.
In a few minutes, the container will have filled with wax.
And when it overflows, your beauty will be preserved forever.
Here, go down there quickly.
- I'm getting out of here.
- We'll go down there and help them.
- What can I do?
- I don't know, we must do something!
Come on, boys. This is it.
They're down there. Quick!
Through the center.
Try it again.
Stop where you are!
Take them away!
- You've got the other papers bleeding.
- Now I'm going to scramble this egg.
- Now, Poison lvy, was that a story?
- You had a million dollars worth of luck.
Listen, stupid, could I do anything that would meet with your approval?
You could. Cut out this crazy business and act like a lady. Marry me.
- Marry you?
- That's what I said.
I'm gonna get even with you, you dirty stiff.
I'll do it.
[Ship Horn Blowing]
Mr. Hogan. Mr. Hogan!
Derelict afloat with a man on board.
- [Hogan] Whereabouts?
- Off your port bow.
[Hogan]
Right.
- Get ahold of him, boys?
- Ah, we've got him. We've got him.
[Men Grunting]
- Want to salvage that boat?
- No.
Take him to my cabin.
Ruth! Ruth!
Ruth!
Easy, old man.
Easy, easy, easy.
[Exhales]
[Sighs]
What ship is this?
The Covena. Trading ship.
We picked you up adrift.
Oh, yeah. I remember.
- Where's she bound?
- Apia.
Apia?
[Chuckles]
I'm in luck.
Luck?
Yeah.
That's where - where I was bound when - when my ship went down.
- Yeah. The Lady Vain, wasn't it?
- Yeah.
Yeah, we picked up her S.O.S.
Then you - you got a wireless aboard?
Yeah.
Will you send a message for me?
Sure, sure.
But you'd better make it short.
You've got a lot of resting to do.
[Groans]
Thanks.
- I suppose it's to Ruth?
- How'd you know her name?
I've heard nothing else for the last two hours.
She's my fiancée.
We're going to be married in Apia.
- Miss Ruth, uh -
- Thomas. Continental Hotel.
What's the message?
Tell her I was picked up by this boat and when we expect to arrive.
Also that I'm all right - thanks to you, Doctor.
You are a doctor, aren't you?
Yes.
At least I was... once upon a time.
- [Dogs Barking]
- [Animals Growling]
[Crowd Chattering]
- What's up, old chap?
- Bulletin on the wreck - Lady Vain.
Oh. Oh, yes.
- [Man] Say, let's go see this.
- [Excited Chattering]
[Crowd Chattering In Foreign Language]
[Men Chattering In English]
Good afternoon.
Be very careful.
[Man]
I leave at dawn.
[Woman]
Miss Thomas! Miss Thomas!
Oh, right here.
- For me?
- Radiogram.
Thank you.
- How do you feel?
- How do I look?
- Better.
- That's the way I feel.
A little turn around the deck will do you good.
Not a bad idea.
[Animal Growling]
[Dog Barking]
[Growling]
[Screeching]
You know,
I thought I heard those things.
Say, what is this, a floating zoo?
[Doctor]
Well, yes, in a way.
[Barking]
Morning, Captain.
- I want to thank you, Captain, for -
- Who are you?
Uh, Mr. Parker, this is Captain Davies.
- How do you do -
- Parker? Parker?
Yeah, we picked him up day before yesterday.
- Why wasn't I told about it?
- Well, we tried to wake you.
- Well, why didn't you?
- You had a slight list to port.
- What do you mean?
- You were drunk.
Drunk, was I?
Well, why wouldn't I be, with a cargo like I got?
- Cargo is cargo.
- Yeah, I know.
But this boatload of filthy animals -
All the way from Mombasa to where?
To some island. Which island?
You answer me that, Mr. Montgomery.
- You're well paid for it.
- [Grunts] Yeah.
An island without a name.
An island not on the chart.
Hey, you think I don't know whose island that is, don't you?
- Well, I do, Mr. Sawbones Montgomery.
- Easy, Captain.
Well, it's Dr. Moreau's island.
Dr. Moreau's island, and it stinks all over the whole South Seas!
Superstitious South Seas gossip!
Dr. Moreau is a brilliant man and a great scientist.
Great scientist, huh?
Well, if you ask me, he's a black-handed, grave-robbin' ghoul.
That's what he is.
[Laughing]
Oh, what's the use?
You're drunk.
Yeah.
[Chuckles]
Hey, what'd you say?
- Nothing.
- Well, that's all right then.
[Dogs Whining]
[Whining, Whimpering]
Hey, what do you got there?
- Slop for dogs.
- Slop?
Ain't there enough slop on this deck already?
[Montgomery]
M'ling, get out.
Yeah, before I -
Go on.
[Dogs Barking]
So I'm drunk, am I?
Only a drunken man would do a thing like that.
That means trouble.
[Barking Continues]
There now. You're all right.
- [Growling]
- M'ling!
[Dogs Barking]
Go forward and stay forward.
Say, who is that fella?
My servant. That's all.
Hey, look here, Parker. You'd better get out of sight and stay out.
There'll be plenty of trouble when he comes to.
Easy, Captain.
- [Boat Motor Rumbling]
- [Dogs Barking]
[Man Shouting, Indistinct]
Get it off of there!
Overboard with the whole spittin' mess of 'em.
Lower away!
- [Barking Continues]
- [Captain] Here it is!
[Captain Shouts]
- Hey, is that Moreau over there?
- Yeah.
Say, what is all this mystery about, uh, Moreau and his island?
I don't know.
If I did know, maybe I'd want to forget.
Hogan!
Mr. Hogan!
- Are we all free and clear?
- All clear, sir.
- All right. Cast off!
- Cast off!
- [Sailor] All right! Cast off!
- Get up there and clear that line off.
There you are, Dr. Moreau.
That's the last of 'em... and this is the last time
I'll ever put in here... forevermore!
Amen!
[Barking Continues]
[Sailors Shouting]
Well, you're gettin' off here.
No, I'm getting off at Apia.
You're gettin' off here.
Cast off that line there.
Now hurry it up.
Now, what's happened?
What is it?
It's all right, old boy.
He fell overboard.
On deck!
On deck! Hey!
- You lost a man.
- Well, finders keepers.
[Laughing]
Full speed ahead, Hogan!
What's that fool talking about?
- Pull up that ladder, men!
- Aye, aye.
Drop that ladder!
I've got to get to Apia!
You can swim, can't ya?
Davies, take this man with you!
You can't do this, Captain.
There's marine law.
This man is shipwrecked.
You've got to pick him up.
Well, I picked him up and I dropped him in my first port of call.
That's all that's required of me!
I can't have this man!
I can't have him aboard.
Well, throw him overboard.
That's what I did.
[Laughing]
- Davies!
- Hey, Davies, drop that ladder!
[Ship Horn Blows]
This is most unfortunate.
It is indeed.
I simply must get to Apia.
I don't see how. We sight a ship about once in a 1 2-month.
Uh, Mr. Parker, Dr. Moreau.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Well, Mr. Parker, you may take
Montgomery and the schooner... and leave for Apia in the morning.
That's very nice. Thank you.
Not at all.
I'm happy to be of service.
Montgomery's a fair sort of sailor.
And I can give you enough of a crew.
Ouran! Gola!
Get away from those cages!
Come on now.
Let's unload this stuff.
The dogs first, then the monkeys and then the cages.
Hurry it up.
I'll stay with Parker tonight on the schooner.
No. I'm taking him up to the house.
Mr. Parker.
- [Parker] Yes.
- You can't do that.
I've got something in mind.
Mr. Parker?
- Would you come with me, please?
- Surely.
[Dogs Barking]
[Sailors Chattering]
You understand, Mr. Parker, you are an uninvited guest.
Certainly.
You may perhaps find our domain rather strange.
I shall have to rely upon your caution while you're here... and your silence when you're gone.
- You understand that?
- Of course, Doctor.
- [Whip Cracks]
- [Fearful Howl]
[Chuckles]
Limestone formation.
Curious, isn't it?
This was once the crater of a volcano.
Extraordinarily fertile this volcanic dust.
Seeds blown here by the wind and brought here by birds.
See the result.
[Whip Cracks]
[Grunts]
Don't be alarmed, Mr. Parker.
You're quite expert with that whip, aren't you, Doctor?
It's a hobby of mine. I learned how to handle one as a boy in Australia.
There's my house.
[Gate Slides Shut]
[Quiet Growling]
[Growls]
Strange-looking natives you have here.
You'll be wanting a cold shower,
I take it, before dinner.
[Growling Continues]
Oh, an excellent brandy, Montgomery.
I hope you brought plenty.
Then, of course, you did.
Montgomery is a man to trust,
Mr. Parker... especially in the selection and the ordering of your liquors.
M'ling, you may take everything.
[Humanlike Groaning]
- [Cup Rattles]
- [Groaning Continues]
Yes.
You are a man of discretion,
Mr. Parker.
I hope so.
And now, if you'll excuse us, there are cigarettes.
- M'ling, brandy for Mr. Parker.
- Nothing more, thank you.
That'll be all, M'ling.
You may go. l, uh, should much prefer,
Mr. Parker... that you don't leave this room.
Your wish, Doctor.
I had my reasons for keeping you sober.
Go to the laboratory.
You'll see what's to be done.
You're not going?
- I'm taking her to Parker.
- Lota to Parker?
Why do you suppose
I brought him to the house?
He's seen too much already.
But she's never seen anything like him.
- No?
- You and I don't count.
The only reactions we get from her are fear and terror.
Hmm. That's understandable.
But how will she respond to Parker where there's no cause for fear?
Will she be attracted?
Is she capable of being attracted?
Has she a woman's emotional impulses?
I'd scarcely hoped for a chance like this short of London.
## [Low Humming]
Lota. Lota.
Come here.
## [Humming]
Lota. I've taught you many things.
Yes?
- All that you know I've taught you.
- Yes.
Mm-hmm.
I'm going to let you learn something for yourself.
A man has come from the sea.
I will take you to him... let you talk with him.
- Yes?
- Mmm.
I'm going to leave you alone with him... and you may talk with him about anything you please... about the world he comes from.
But you must say nothing about me... nothing about the Law... nothing about the House of Pain.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.
Then come along with me.
[Animal Growling]
[Lota Gasps]
Get out!
Get out, I said!
[Chuckling]
It's all right.
Go in, Lota.
- This is Mr. Parker, Lota.
- How do you do?
Don't be afraid.
How... do you do?
Mr. Parker has come to us from over the sea.
She's a pure Polynesian... the only woman on the entire island.
Well, I'll leave you two young people together.
I've got work to do.
Won't you sit down?
Cigarette?
No.
- I thank you.
- You're welcome.
You'll have to pardon me because... this is all very strange to me.
What island are you from? Tahiti?
Samoa?
I mean, where is your home?
Home?
This my home.
I know, but you're not a native of this island.
I know because I've seen some of them.
How does it happen that you're the only woman on this island?
Did, uh, Dr. Moreau bring you here?
Pardon me if I seem to be too inquisitive.
Moreau!
Quickly, please!
What now?
You come from the sea?
Well, rather.
Three days on an upturned lifeboat.
You go away?
Tomorrow morning.
I wish you would not go away.
Well, that's very nice of you, but...
I must.
You come back... again?
Well, I - I don't know.
[Screaming, Groaning]
[Groaning Continues]
- What's that?
- It's the House - the House of Pain!
[Loud Groaning]
No! No!
- It's nothing! It's nothing.
- [Groaning Continues]
Nothing?
Somebody's being tortured.
- [Groaning]
- Get out!
Get out!
They're vivisecting a human being.
They're cutting a living man to pieces.
Now I know about his natives.
They're his victims.
You and I may be next.
Come on. Let's get out of here.
Other gate!
We'll take Moreau's boat and get away from here tonight - now.
[Beast Man]
Sea! Sea!
- [Lota Gasps]
- [Growling]
Man from sea! Man from sea!
[All Growling, Groaning]
Lota!
[Beast Men Shouting]
[All Growling]
- [Hooting]
- Stop!
Stop!
- What? What?
- Man from sea.
- They are like us!
- They are like him.
One is not man.
[Others Growling, Muttering]
[Gong Clangs]
[Shrieking, Hooting]
[Beast Men Fall Silent]
[Whip Cracks]
What is the Law?
Not to run on all fours.
That is the Law.
Are we not men?
[Beast Men, Growling Voices]
Are we not men?
- [Whip Cracks]
- What is the Law?
Not to eat meat.
That is the Law.
Are we not men?
[Beast Men]
Are we not men?
[Whip Cracks]
What is the Law?
Not to spill blood.
That is the Law.
Are we not men?
[Beast Men]
Are we not men?
His is the hand that makes.
[Beast Men]
His is the hand that makes.
[Sayer Of The Law]
His is the hand that heals!
[Beast Men]
His is the hand that heals.
His is the House of Pain!
[Beast Men]
His is the House of Pain.
[Excited Shouting]
I didn't think, after my warning, you'd be idiotic enough to leave the house.
Now I can understand why you and your island... stink from one end of the South Seas to the other.
What makes your natives such monstrosities?
I saw you vivisecting a man.
My dear young fool, you're entirely mistaken.
Well, you can't get away with it in my case, Moreau.
Take it.
I'm now unarmed, and you're fully protected.
It's quite evident, isn't it, that I mean you no harm?
[Chuckles] Would you be good enough to come to the house?
Lota.
Lota, go to your room.
[Lock Turns]
I started with plant life in London 20 years ago.
I took an orchid, and upon it I performed a miracle.
I stripped a hundred thousand years of slow evolution from it... and I had no longer an orchid... but what orchids will be a hundred thousand years from now.
That's one there.
Yes, but how, Doctor?
[Laughs] By a slight change in the single unit of a germ plasm.
It was as simple as that.
That's a common lily.
That's a chrysanthemum.
That's unfortunately what happened to some asparagus.
[Laughing]
I went on with this research just as it led me.
I let my imagination run fantastically ahead.
Why not experiment with the more complex organisms?
- [Pounding Whip Handle]
- [Roaring]
[Laughs]
Man is the present climax of a long process of organic revolution.
All animal life is tending toward the human form.
[Laughs] I was still in London when l began this phase of my experiments.
One day a dog escaped from my laboratory... ran shrieking into the street.
And I left London, Mr. Parker... the newspapers at my heels, an aroused England crying for my blood.
I picked up Montgomery and brought him along.
He was a medical student facing a prison term for a professional indiscretion.
That was 1 1 long years ago.
Eleven long years
I've worked and I've worked.
[Gasps]
With plastic surgery, blood transfusions... gland extracts, with ray baths.
[Chuckles] With what
I have discovered in my own work... among the cellular organisms.
My work, my discoveries.
- Mine alone.
- [Beast Man Groaning]
With these I have wiped out hundreds of thousands of years of evolution.
From the lower animals,
I have made -
[Groaning Continues]
Well, see for yourself, Mr. Parker.
[Groaning]
[Groaning Louder]
You're convinced that this thing on the table isn't human.
Its cries are human.
- You know what it is that I began with?
- No.
- An animal.
- An animal?
- Mm-hmm.
- Like those in the cages outside?
Then those - those creatures out in the jungle?
Are my creations.
- They were made from animals?
- Yes.
Was this thing, this poor, tortured creature -
What does that matter?
Of all things vile!
Mr. Parker, spare me these youthful horrors, please.
And those - those poor things out there in the jungle - those animals -
They - They talk.
That was my first great achievement - articulate speech controlled by the brain.
That was an achievement.
Oh, it takes a long time and infinite patience... to make them talk.
[Chuckles] Someday,
I'll create a woman, and it'll be easier.
Those are some of my less successful experiments.
They supply the power to create others... more successful.
But with each experiment,
I improve upon the last.
I get nearer and nearer.
Mr. Parker.
Do you know what it means to feel like God?
[Chuckles]
I'm talking too much, aren't I?
- Good night, Mr. Parker.
- Good night.
- You know the way to your room?
- Yes, thanks.
I hope you sleep well.
Thanks.
Good night.
Did you see that, Montgomery?
She was tender, like a woman.
How that little scene spurs the scientific imagination onward.
I wonder how much of Lota's animal origin is still alive... how nearly a perfect woman she is.
It's possible I may find out... with the aid of Mr. Parker.
You won't have much time if he leaves for Apia in the morning.
Wouldn't it be a great loss to science if he left for Apia in the morning?
[Montgomery]
Four with a fair wind.
- I want to thank you, Doctor, for -
- Not at all.
I'm only too happy to have been of service to you.
Yes, but I do appreciate what you're doing for -
Oh! Oh, this is most distressing.
I - I don't know what to say about it.
I can't account for it.
Unless, of course, the natives.
They were a bit out of hand last night.
- [Man] ...good time!
- [Man #2] You said it, mate!
[Chattering, Laughing]
- [Man] Come on, you guys.
- [Man #2] Hello! Welcome home!
- Hello, darlin'! How you been?
- Hello, baby!
- Did you miss me?
- Did I miss ya?
Pardon me. Excuse me, please.
Didn't you have a Mr. Parker on board?
- Parker?
- Yes.
Oh. You better talk to the skipper.
Let's go.
Now, men, stay sober.
Any drinking to be done,
I'll do it myself.
- [Man] Okay, Captain!
- [Men Laughing]
And if you get in a fight, send for me.
[Men Chattering]
- Oh, Captain.
- Hello there, baby.
Captain, didn't you have a Mr. Parker on board?
- Parker?
- Yes.
No.
But won't I do?
Didn't you rescue him from the Lady Vain?
He sent me a wireless from your ship.
Oh, yes. He got off at my first port of call.
At what port?
That's my business.
Maybe the American consul will make it his business.
Well, give the consul my regards.
You knew this man wanted to come to Apia, didn't you?
Well, I rescued him at sea and dropped him off at my first port of call.
- That's all that's required of me, sir.
- What port?
- Well, it was an island, sir.
- What island?
Latitude 1 5 degrees south and longitude 1 70 west, sir.
1 -5 south, 1 -7-0 west.
It's very small, sir.
You won't find it on the charts.
Then it isn't a port.
Well, it's an island, sir.
I dropped some cargo there.
Oh, I see.
That'll be all for the present.
Yes, sir.
If I find any irregularity in this,
I'll have your license revoked.
Yes, sir.
You wouldn't like that, would you?
- No, sir.
- I didn't think you would.
Yes, sir.
[Door Closes]
- Yes, sir!
- [Consul] How are you, Captain?
Miss Thomas, this is Captain Donahue.
- How do you do?
- How do you do, miss?
- When will you be ready to sail?
- I'm ready now, sir.
You'll find Donahue's boat perfectly safe, but not very comfortable.
I've worked it all over.
Are you clear on the position?
Yes - 1 5 south and 1 70 west.
Okay.
- Well, good luck.
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all.
Very glad to be of service to you.
Lota.
You startled me.
You're a strange child.
Talk to me.
Not now.
Talk to me.
Lota, do you know what this is?
- Book.
- Yes. Book.
From Dr. Moreau's library.
About electricity - wireless telegraphy, radio... how to build a shortwave transmitter.
Of course, you haven't the faintest idea what I'm talking about, have you?
Talk to me more.
All right.
I'll tell you something you will understand.
Lota, I must get away from this island.
Book... take you away?
Maybe book take me away.
[Parker]
Lota!
[Parker]
Why did you do that?
[Lota]
Book take you away.
Lota.
I'm in love with someone else.
I should've told you.
Love?
[Lota Gasps]
Lota.
- Moreau, you don't deserve to live!
- I beg your pardon?
Those creatures out there in the jungle were horrible enough.
But to have created a thing as tragic as that girl.
- [Tea Pouring]
- Lota?
Yes. Lota.
An animal with a woman's emotions - a woman's heartbreak, a woman's suffering.
Oh, it's criminal!
Hmm. You're an amazingly unscientific young man.
I could've overlooked those others.
I could've shown you that much consideration.
But not now.
Now I'll expose you to the world for what you really are, Moreau.
When are you leaving?
I think you'd better sit down and make yourself comfortable.
- Would you care for a cup of tea?
- No, thank you.
Well, we may as well discuss this frankly now that you know the facts.
Lota is my most nearly perfect creation.
I was thinking of taking her with me as Exhibit "A"... on a triumphal return to London.
I wanted to prove how completely she was a woman - whether she was capable of loving, mating and having children.
She was afraid of Montgomery and myself.
Then you came.
Well, she was very much attracted to you.
You can see, of course, the possibilities that presented themselves.
I'll tell you this, Moreau!
You'll make arrangements for me to leave this island somehow... and as quickly as possible.
Or this great scientific work you've been doing will stop.
How did he find out?
What did you say to him?
What did you do to let him know?
What is it, Moreau?
The stubborn beast flesh creeping back.
Well, it's no use, Montgomery.
I may as well quit.
Day by day, it creeps back.
It creeps back.
[Sobbing]
You see this?
[Lota Whimpering, Crying]
The first of them all to shed tears.
She is human!
I'm not beaten!
[Laughing]
Get everything ready.
For what?
This time, I'll burn out all the animal in her!
No!
[Whimpers]
[Moreau]
I'll make her completely human.
No, no.
- No. No!
- [Moreau Laughing]
I'll keep Parker here.
He's already attracted.
[Crying]
Time and monotony will do the rest.
- [Whimpering]
- [Moreau Laughing]
Gola! Gola!
- Huh?
- Boat come!
Man. One not man.
- One not man?
- One like Lota.
Hello in there!
I guess it's all right.
- You afraid?
- No. Of course not.
All right.
I just asked out of politeness.
Look!
You see some funny sights in these islands.
That jungle don't look any too inviting.
We must go on.
We've got to find him.
All right.
But I'd just as soon leave it for somebody else to do... if there was anybody else here to do it.
[Screeching]
[Screeching Continues]
You know, there's a bird in these jungles - kind of a parrot, laughs like a man.
They call 'im a Laughing Jackass.
[Laughs]
Funny name for a bird.
I don't know, when you figure out he laughs like a man... that's not such a funny name after all.
You're taking a very long time,
Montgomery.
There's a short circuit here somewhere.
M'ling!
- They come on boat!
- Who?
- People.
- People?
Two. One like Lota.
Dr. Moreau!
Dr. Moreau! Doctor!
Dr. Moreau!
- Boat come. People.
- People?
- Man and one like Lota.
- What?
Parker sent a wireless to Apia from Davies's ship.
Hello there.
[Screams]
Ouran.
We're looking for a man named Parker -
Edward Parker.
Oh, won't you come in?
Yeah. Thanks.
I'm Dr. Moreau.
This is my house. You're very welcome.
Oh, thank you, Doctor.
I'm Ruth Thomas.
- And this is Captain Donahue.
- How are ya, Doc?
- How do you do? Go right in.
- Thank you.
Nice little place you got here, Doc.
It serves its purpose.
Ruth!
Oh.
Ouran.
All right, Ouran.
[Lock Turns]
I may not need Parker.
This is Captain Donahue.
He was good enough to bring me here.
- How do you do, Captain?
- Fine, thanks. How are you?
[Moreau]
So you found him.
You know, I - I'd imagined Edward in some terrible place.
But this is charming.
I'll get my things, and we'll be on our way.
It's getting late.
- You'll pardon me, Doctor?
- [Moreau] Not at all.
- Won't you come in and wait?
- Thank you.
What kind of a place did you say this was, Doc?
- I didn't say.
- Oh.
It's an experimental station, of a sort, for bio-anthropological research.
Oh, I see.
[Montgomery]
Lota.
House of Pain.
No.
No House of Pain.
I promise that.
There's no twilight in the tropics.
Night falls like a curtain.
Thank you, M'ling.
- Would you care for a highball,
Miss Thomas?
- No, thank you.
- Captain Donahue, I suppose you'll -
- I'll take mine straight.
I thought so.
Whoa. That'll do. Thanks.
- Mr. Parker?
- No, thanks. We'll be going now.
Aren't you being a little rash,
Mr. Parker?
- Rash?
- Come on, Donahue.
You have a mile to go through my jungle.
- Yes, I realize that.
- [Donahue] We're not afraid.
I can see, Captain Donahue, that you would be afraid of nothing.
But Mr. Parker had one experience at night in my jungle.
I have no wish to frighten you,
Miss Thomas... but if Mr. Parker chooses to put you in what he knows to be real danger... it will be his responsibility.
Couldn't you send someone -
If you care to accept the hospitality of my house... you can leave in complete safety in the morning.
Well, perhaps that would be better.
Captain Donahue, you can share Mr. Parker's room.
Miss Thomas, you can have my room.
[Gong Chimes]
M'ling. Dinner will be for five.
[Moreau Murmurs]
[Moreau]
No wine, Montgomery?
No.
Extraordinary.
My regards, Captain Donahue.
Here's mud in your eye, Doc.
Doc, I see you're a vegetarian.
It's on account of the natives.
They've never tasted meat.
No long pig?
"Long pig"?
He means human flesh, Miss Thomas.
Oh.
[Beast Men Chanting, Indistinct]
What's that?
The natives.
They have a curious ceremony.
Mr. Parker's witnessed it.
Tell us about it, Edward.
Oh, it's - it's nothing.
They are restless tonight.
[Gasps]
What is it, dear?
Oh, uh, nothing.
[Chuckles Uneasily]
Don't pay any attention to me.
A little more claret, Captain Donahue?
Eh, don't mind if I do.
M'ling, fill up Captain Donahue's glass.
[Clears Throat]
Whoa, whoa. Whoa. That'll do.
- Well.
- Skoal!
- Good night, Doc. That sure was swell wine.
- Thank you.
- [Ruth] Good night, Dr. Moreau.
- Good night, Miss Thomas.
- [Parker] Good night.
- [Moreau] Good night.
Whoa!
[Donahue]
Say, it's a good thing I ain't a drinkin' man.
You did very well for yourself tonight.
Oh, you oughta see me when I'm real -
Yes, I - I have a rough idea.
I remember one night down in Mombasa -
Captain, uh, that's our room over there.
Oh, sure.
- Good night, Miss Thomas.
- Good night.
Don't be frightened, dear.
I'll be just across the hall.
Oh, I'm all right.
What's there to be afraid of?
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Better lock your door.
- Now don't you worry.
I'll be all right.
If you need me, call.
Good night.
[Bar Grating]
- [Bar Grating]
- [Gasps]
[Screaming]
[Screaming Continues]
[Whimpering, Screaming]
Ruth! What is it?
[Gunshot]
[Parker]
Quick!
You'd better get dressed, dear.
Ouran tried to break into her room -
Miss Thomas's room.
- But I suppose you know that.
- I heard a scream and some shots.
And that's all you know, is it?
You didn't want it to happen, of course.
That isn't what you meant when you said that you might not need Parker?
Will you mind your own business?
I know you too well and too long, Moreau.
I've stood for anything.
I have stood for plenty.
But not this.
You're insane to even think of it, and I'm through with you here and now.
Are you going back to England... to prison?
I'd prefer it.
Same one that peeked out through the bushes this afternoon?
Yes. It was horrible.
We're no safer here than in the jungle.
I'd advise the jungle.
I'm sure Miss Thomas would be safer there.
I'm going to the ship and get my crew.
We'll stop this.
- Come with me a minute.
- I don't like your taking this risk.
I've been in tighter places than this, and the old head is still on its hinges.
- Here. You may need this.
- No, no. I'm already heeled.
I'll take that lantern.
That might come in handy.
Here. Here's the key to the front gate.
Well, here goes nothin'.
[Footsteps]
Ouran.
I want you to follow him and put your hands around his throat until -
- [Ouran] The Law.
- It's all right tonight.
[Beast Men Growl]
[Donahue]
Get back there!
Get back!
Thanks, Montgomery.
You must have a pretty good reason for helping us.
I have.
I'm going with you.
[Beast Men Growling]
Get back! Get back!
[Screeching, Whimpering]
[Donahue Gasping, Choking]
[Beast Men Screeching]

It's better that we leave her here.
The fire will soon destroy all of Moreau's work.

Don't look back.
Hold it!
Ten. 20.
Did you hear about
Mrs Mason's little Willy?
Sent him to school and found him buried ten foot deep in a snowdrift.
- How did they get him out?
- Brought the fire engine round.
Put the hose pipe in, pumped it backwards and sucked him out.
Perfect bull's-eye.
I want a room and a fire.
- Jenny?
- Hello?
There's a gent here what wants a room and a fire.
What, a room?
I said a room.
We ain't got none ready, not at this time of year.
We don't usually have folks stopping, except in the summer.
You can get one ready.
Certainly, sir. Millie!
Yes?
- I want a private sitting room, too.
- Certainly, sir.
Will you come through, sir? This way, sir.
It's the coldest winter we've had down here for years.
They put all the sheep and the cows in for a fortnight now.
Poor things. They can't get a blade of green grass.
You may be near-sighted, but you can't be deaf-and-dumb as well.
Could I take your coat and hat, sir, and give 'em a nice dry in the kitchen?
No.
- I prefer to keep them on.
- Very good, sir.
The room will be warm soon.
I've got some luggage at the station.
How can I have it sent?
I'll get it dropped over tomorrow.
Are you staying a bit?
Yes.
- Is there no way of getting it tonight?
- Not tonight, sir.
Very well.
Bring me some food.
Right away, sir.
If you ask me, he's a criminal flying from justice.
Go on. He's snow-blind, that's what he is.
Has to wear goggles to save his eyes.
Anyway, you be careful, and lock your money up.
A bottle of Bass, Herbert.
Here you are, dear.
I hope he'll be a bit more communicative this time.
Your supper's there.
Is there a key to that door?
A key, sir? Ooh, I haven't ever seen one.
I don't think there was one when we came here.
I want to be left alone, and undisturbed.
I'll see that no one disturbs you, sir.
The mustard, ma'am.
You'll be the death of me with your slowness.
You let me take his supper in and forget the mustard.
And him wanting to be left alone!
There she goes again.
I told you not to disturb me.
It's only the mustard, sir. I forgot it.
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.
Have you been motoring on them slippery roads, sir?
You can take my overcoat and dry it.
Very good, sir.
- Leave the hat.
- Yes, sir.
Bandages, right up to the top of his head.
All round his ears.
- Any blood?
- No. No blood.
Looks like some kind of 'orrible accident.
Bumped his head on the prison wall gettin' over.
Father.
I wish you'd leave me alone,
Flora, when I'm working.
I can't bear it. We've got to do something.
- Do something? What about?
- About Jack.
He'll come back. Don't you worry.
Father, please put that horrid thing down and listen.
It's nearly a month now, without a word.
But the note he left was quite clear.
He said we might not hear for a while.
It's good to go away when you're finishing a difficult experiment.
- What kind of experiment is it, Father?
- Something of his own.
I had a terrible feeling last night.
I felt he was in desperate trouble.
Hello, Kemp. Flora's worried about Griffin.
I don't wonder. I should have thought at least he could drop a line.
It's a queer thing.
It certainly is, considering he was in your employ.
He had my permission to carry out his own experiments in his spare time.
And to clear off when he liked?
What does it matter, if he's in trouble?
I've got the car outside.
It'll give you a rest to come for a run.
Do you think there are any papers in his room?
Surely he must have arranged where he was going. There may be letters.
He left burnt papers in his fireplace, that's all.
He was so strange those last few days before he went. So excited and strung up.
Yet he wouldn't say a word to explain.
I've never seen him like it before.
He was always so keen to tell me about his experiments.
He meddled in things men should leave alone.
Your father's a scientist. He's discovered more about preserving food than anyone.
Jack and I were employed to help him.
That's a plain, straightforward job.
It's not romantic, but it saves hundreds of deaths and stomachaches.
What things should men leave alone?
He worked in secret. He kept a lot of stuff locked in a big cupboard in his laboratory.
He never opened it until he'd barred the door and drawn the blinds.
Straightforward scientists have no need for barred doors and drawn blinds.
He cares nothing for you, Flora.
He'll never care about anything but test tubes and chemicals.
How can he go away like this without a word?
Flora, dear. Please, darling, let me tell you how I feel.
- I can't work or sleep until I know.
- Leave me alone! How can you?
There's a way back, you fool.
There must be a way back.
- What is it?
- Your luncheon.
- Take it away.
- You don't want it cold, do you?
Do you suppose that I'm going to carry trays backwards and forwards all day?
Luncheon's at one, and it's one now!
Get out!
He's not gonna stay under this roof, not another hour!
Crashed the tray out of me hand, and swore at me.
Turns my best sitting room into a chemist's shop.
Spillages on the carpets!
And him a week behind with his money!
Go and tell him if he ain't packed up and gone in half an hour, we'll have the law in to turn him out.
And take him his bill.
Three pounds ten.
And see you get it before you come out.
Go on.
Let's leave him a bit, Jenny, till he cools off.
Go on, do it now. Him and his goggles and his chemist's shop!
If you don't kick him out, I'm clearing out myself, and I mean it this time!
And a whole day's work ruined by a foolish, ignorant woman!
There must be a way back.
God knows there's a way back.
If only they'd leave me alone.
Look 'ere, mister, we can't have this no more.
You broke the wife's best china, you're behind with the rent. Pack up and go.
I'm expecting some money, Mr Hall.
I'll pay you directly it comes.
You said that last week.
I came here for quiet and secrecy.
I'm carrying out a difficult experiment.
I must be left alone. It's vital. It's life and death that I should be left alone.
- You don't understand.
- I understand all right.
You don't pay. And what's more, you're driving folks away from our house.
Mr Hall, I've had a serious accident.
It's disfigured me, affected my eyes.
I mean the way you carry on, throwing things about on the carpets and swearing.
- It's no good, mister, you've got to go.
- I implore you to let me stay. I beg of you.
The wife says if you don't go, she is, so it's gotta be you.
Come on. I'll help you to get this stuff packed up.
Leave that alone and get out of here!
Look here! Is this my house or yours?
What are you doing?
Help! Help! Police!
He's a raving lunatic!
Go and get a policeman.
Please don't cry, now.
He's all right.
Oh, shut up!
- Come on, Jaffers!
- Here, what's all this?
It's the stranger with the goggles.
He's gone mad. He's assaulted Mrs Hall and nearly killed her husband.
Oh.
- Where is he?
- He's upstairs in the sitting room.
He's in there, in the sitting room.
He's homicidal.
Oh.
Let that there.
Here, keep back, you kids there.
- Here, what's all this?
- Keep back there.
Keep back, me?
Do you know who you're talking to?
I give you a last chance to leave me alone.
Give me a last chance? You've committed assault, that's what you've done, and you can come along to the station with me.
Come along, now. Come quietly, unless you want me to put the handcuffs on.
Stop where you are.
You don't know what you're doing.
I know what I'm doing all right. Come on.
- Get hold of him.
- Lock him up!
All right, you fools.
You've brought it on yourselves.
Everything would have come right if you'd only left me alone.
You've driven me near madness with your peering through the keyholes and gaping through the curtains.
And now you'll suffer for it!
You're crazy to know who I am, aren't you?
All right! I'll show you!
There's a souvenir for you.
And one for you.
I'll show you who I am and what I am.
Look. He's all eaten away.
How do you like that, eh?
- It was 'orrible.
- What's wrong?
- Jaffers, what do you think?
- He's invisible, that's what's the matter.
If he gets the rest of them clothes off, we'll never catch him in a thousand years.
Come on.
They've asked for it, the country bumpkins.
This'll give them a bit of a shock.
Something to write home about.
A nice bedtime story for the kids, too, if they want it.
- Put the handcuffs on.
- How can I handcuff a bloomin' shirt?
Quick! Get hold of him!
Ow!
Are you satisfied now, you fools?
It's easy, really, if you're clever.
A few chemicals mixed together, that's all, and flesh and blood and bone just fade away.
A little of this injected under the skin of the arm every day for a month.
An invisible man can rule the world.
Nobody will see him come, nobody will see him go.
He can hear every secret.
He can rob and kill!
Not if he can't get no further than this room, he won't.
Here, shut that door.
You'd better come along quietly.
Look out! Mind that window!
You think I'd escape like a common criminal?
You need a lesson.
I think I'll throttle you.
Let go of me!
Let go!
You must be made to understand what I can do.
Hey, look out!
Hey, whoa!
Hey, hey!
Look out! Get indoors!
Everybody get indoors!
I'm afraid I need this bicycle. Ha-ha!
He stole me bike!
Here's your blooming bicycle.
You can do what you like with it.
How's that for a hairbrush, George Henry?
Good morning, Grandfather.
How do you do?
We'll do our part.
Mama, give me the diamonds!
On the gospel, it's the truth.
He tried to strangle me, sir.
Where are you speaking from, Jaffers?
Lion's Head inn, eh?
Did you say an invisible man?
Well, look here, you put more water in it next time!
He won't believe me. You tell him.
Mr Hall speaking.
The constable's telling the truth all right.
Not the slightest clue.
I didn't expect there would be.
That's where the clues are.
He wasn't leaving anything to chance.
Griffin was never the man for secrets.
He came to me with everything.
He kept a lot of stuff locked in here.
I came in one evening when he wasn't expecting me.
He was by this cupboard.
It was full of instruments.
When he saw me, he slammed the door and turned the key.
You say he brought a packing case up here?
The night before he disappeared. I heard him hammering, packing everything up.
- Here's something, Kemp.
- What is it?
- Bad news?
- It's only a rough note.
A list of chemicals, and the last on the list is monocane.
Monocane? What is monocane?
- Monocane's a terrible drug.
- I never heard of it.
You wouldn't, Kemp. It's never used now.
I didn't know it was even made.
It's a drug that's made from a flower that's grown in India.
It draws colour from everything it touches.
Years ago they tried it for bleaching cloth.
They gave it up because it destroyed the material.
- That doesn't sound very terrible.
- I know, but it does something else.
It was tried out on some poor animal - a dog, I believe.
It was injected under the skin, and it turned the dog dead white, like a marble statue.
- Is that so?
- Yes, and it also sent it raving mad.
You surely don't think...?
I only pray to God that Griffin hasn't been meddling with this ghastly stuff.
- He'd never touch a thing with madness.
- He might not know.
I found that experiment in an old German book just by chance.
The English books only describe the bleaching power.
- What are we going to do?
- Tell the police that Griffin's disappeared.
But only that he's disappeared.
I put you on your honour, Kemp, not to breathe a word of this to anyone.
- Shall I go with you?
- It's all right, Kemp.
I'll go tonight, when Inspector Lane's on duty.
I'll run along back home, then.
- Good night.
- Good night, Kemp.
This is the national station broadcasting this evening's news.
Remarkable story from country village.
Police and doctors are investigating a story told this afternoon by the people of the village of Iping.
A mysterious disease has broken out infecting many of the inhabitants.
It takes the form of a delusion that an invisible man is living among them.
Several people have been seriously injured, probably through fiighting, in their belief that their opponent is an invisible man.
The whole village is in a state of panic and everyone...
Everyone deserves the fate that's coming to them.
Panic, death, things worse than death.
Don't be afraid, Kemp.
It's me - Griffin. Jack Griffin.
How are you, my friend?
Brrr! I'm frozen with cold.
Dead tired. Thank God for a fire.
Sit down, you fool.
Let's have a decent fire.
D'you hear me? Sit down, unless you want me to knock your brains out.
Sit down!
I want you to listen carefully, Kemp.
I've been through hell today.
I want food and sleep, but before we sleep, there's work to do.
May I have a cigarette?
You always were a dirty little coward, Kemp.
You're frightened out of your wits, aren't you?
Oh, it's no good talking like this.
Have you got a good long surgical bandage?
Good. And a pair of dark glasses?
Right. Go and get them, at once.
Let me have a dressing gown and pyjamas and a pair of gloves.
You'll feel better if you can see me, won't you?
Come on. You've no time to waste.
You'll find some pyjamas in that room.
Here are the gloves and bandages.
- I'll bring you the glasses.
- Thank you. Don't be long.
Put them on the table.
Now go down and draw the blinds in your sitting room.
- Are we alone in the house?
- Yes.
Good. All right, go now. If you raise a finger against me, you're a dead man.
I'm strong and I'll strangle you. understand? Wait for me downstairs.
The sitting room, I said, Kemp.
And if you try and escape by the window,
I shall follow you, and no one in the world can save you.
Here comes the inspector now.
Get up.
Nice fool you've made of me.
I've got reports for ten miles around.
Not a sign of anything.
I'll tell you what I think of your invisible man: it's a hoax.
Good business for the saloon bar, eh, Mr Hall?
Suppose I'd break my neck to sell a gallon of beer?
I'll have an inquiry right now.
Bring in everybody who thinks they saw or heard anything.
I'll get to the bottom of this.
Get those tables together.
Now, Kemp.
Now then, we can talk as man to man.
Sit down.
One day I'll tell you everything.
There's no time now.
I began five years ago in secret, working all night, every night, right into the dawn.
A thousand experiments, a thousand failures, and then at last the great, wonderful day.
- But, Griffin, it's ghastly!
- The great, wonderful day.
The last little mixture of drugs.
I couldn't stay here any longer, Kemp.
I couldn't let you see me slowly fading away.
So I packed up and went to a village for secrecy and quiet, to finish the experiment and complete the antidote, the way back to visible man again.
I meant to come back just as I was when you saw me last.
But the fools wouldn't let me work in peace. I had to teach them a lesson.
But why? Why do it, Griffin?
Just a scientific experiment at first.
That's all. To do something no other man in the world had done.
But there's more to it than that, Kemp.
I know now.
It came to me suddenly. The drugs I took seemed to light up my brain.
Suddenly I realised the power I held, the power to rule, to make the world grovel at my feet.
We'll soon put the world right now, Kemp.
You and I.
I? You mean...?
I must have a partner, Kemp, a visible partner, to help me in the little things.
You're my partner, Kemp.
We'll begin with a reign of terror.
A few murders here and there.
Murders of great men, murders of little men, just to show we make no distinction.
We might even wreck a train or two.
Just these fingers round a signalman's throat, that's all.
Griffin, for heaven's sake!
- Do you want me to take these off?
- No, no.
Very well, then.
We'll make our plans tomorrow.
Tonight we have a small job to do.
Go and get your car out, Kemp.
- Where are we going?
- To the village I left this morning.
I came away without my notebooks. They contain all the results of my experiments.
- But it's past eight o'clock.
- It's only 15 miles.
Go now. Quickly.
Take a bag with you for the books.
Put a warm rug in the car. It's cold outside when you have to go about naked.
- All ready?
- Yes.
Come on! Get in!
- Where's that rug?
- In the back.
I'm frozen. It's cold enough to freeze the icicles off an Eskimo.
We'll stop in a lane near the inn. I'll give you the books through the window.
- They'll have a guard.
- What can a guard do, you fool?
I must have those books, Kemp. I'll work in your laboratory till I find the antidote.
Sometimes I'll make you invisible, give me a rest.
I was walking home to me lunch, sir, when all of a sudden something takes hold of me hat and throws it in the pond.
- How many drinks did you have?
- Only a couple, sir, that's all.
A couple of drinks and a gust of wind.
So much for you.
Now then, about the bicycle.
Where's the owner of the bicycle?
Here, sir.
It was pulled clean out of me hands, sir.
Then it pedalled off down the street, all by itself.
Stop here.
Come on, get out.
Take your bag and walk down the street.
I'll guide you.
Wait outside the window till the books come out.
Put them in your bag and come back to the car. Then wait for me.
Don't stare at me, you fool.
Look in front of you.
Come on! Get a move on.
Here we are, Kemp, in here.
Here. Stroll up and down as though you were waiting for someone.
Watch for that window to open.
Griffin? Griffin? Are you there?
- Who's that, opened that door?
- It's them boys again, sir.
Here, you leave this door alone!
It's private, see!
- Aw, we never touched it.
- Yes, you did.
Go on, hop it. Go on!
There you are, Kemp.
Lies from beginning to end!
I've a good mind to prosecute all of you for conspiracy.
I shall announce this evening that the whole thing's a hoax, and you'll be the laughing stock of the entire country.
He's here! The invisible man!
Don't leave me! Wait for me!
A hoax, is it? All a hoax?
All a hoax?
There.
All right. Off you go.
Go for your life, too.
- Did you hear shouting and screaming?
- What was that screaming?
I had to take some exercise to keep warm.
I killed a stupid policeman.
Smashed his head in.
We start in earnest tomorrow morning, Kemp.
- Good evening, Doctor.
- Is Inspector Lane at the station?
- I want a word with him.
- Yes, sir.
Extra special!
Invisible man slays policeman!
- Nasty business, this.
- It's a conjuring trick, that's what it is.
I saw a fella make a peanut disappear once.
There are one or two things you must understand, Kemp.
I must always remain in hiding for an hour after meals.
The food is visible inside me until it is digested.
I can only work on fine, clear days.
If I work in the rain, the water can be seen on my head and shoulders.
In a fog you can see me, like a bubble.
In smoky cities the soot settles on me until you can see a dark outline.
You must always be near at hand to wipe off my feet.
Even dirt between my fingernails would give me away.
It is difficult at first to walk down stairs.
We are so accustomed to watching our feet.
But these are trivial difficulties. We shall find ways of defeating everything.
You will sleep in the room opposite.
And bring me some more food at eight o'clock.
Good night.
Now you will understand my plans.
You're in charge of all country to the east, Thompson,
- for 20 miles to the north of the road.
- Very good, sir.
Neville, you take the opposite section to the south.
Stoland, you take charge of the search in the hills.
And, Hogan, you take all the villages, out to the river.
Now, we shall comb the country for 20 miles round.
We've got a terrible responsibility.
He's mad and he's invisible.
He may be standing beside us now.
But he's human and we shall get him.
We shall have 1,000 men out tonight.
Tomorrow we shall have
10,000 volunteers to help them.
There's a broadcast warning going out at 10.30.
Now, at all costs, we must avoid a panic spreading.
Get word to your districts, and send me a note of your headquarters.
And remember, he'll leave tracks, even if he himself is invisible.
I must interrupt the music for a moment.
I have an urgent message from the police.
Earlier this evening we broadcast a report of an invisible man.
The report has now been confiirmed.
It appears that an unknown man by scientifiic means has made himself invisible.
He has attacked and killed a police inspector and is now at large.
The chief of police appeals to the public for help and assistance.
Those willing to cooperate are requested to report tomorrow to their local station.
The invisible man works without clothing.
He will have to seek shelter.
You're requested to lock every door and window, and every outbuilding he may use to hide in.
The police will be glad of any suggestions that will help in capturing the fugitive.
Remember, he's solid but cannot be seen.
A reward of £1,000 will be given to any person whose information leads to his capture.
The police appeal to the public to keep calm and to admit uniformed search parties to all property.
- I've got the doors padlocked.
- I'll keep him out!
Hello.
Hello. Get me Esher, 1021.
Hello?
Doctor, it's something ghastly.
It's Griffin. He's come back.
He's the invisible man.
He's asleep in my room.
He's mad, a raving lunatic.
He's killed a man tonight.
Listen to me, Kemp.
No one but you and I know that it's Griffin.
- I shall come in the morning.
- You must come now. I can't bear it!
If I come now, he'll be suspicious and escape.
You must keep him calm and quiet for tonight. I trust you, Kemp.
- Who was that, Father?
- It was Kemp.
It was about Jack. I know it.
What is it? Tell me.
- Leave me alone, Flora, please.
- I'm not afraid. Tell me.
Jack Griffin's come back.
He's at Dr Kemp's house now.
Jack Griffin's the invisible man.
Is that the police?
Was that £1,000 reward all right?
Well, listen, I've got a way to catch him.
The paper says he threw ink at the man he killed.
Get your own back and squirt ink about with a hose pipe till you hit him.
The ink'll stick on him.
Then you can shoot him.
Is that the police? I wanna tell you how to catch the invisible man.
The paper says it's going to be frosty in a day or two.
Well, you watch out when there's frost, see, then you can see his breath.
Police, quickly.
Is this the police? This is Dr Kemp.
The invisible man is in my house, asleep upstairs. Come at once. Hurry!
But, listen, Doctor,
I've only got five men here.
I'd want 100 to surround the house.
Yes, all right. I'll send them up as soon as possible.
Leave it to me and Kemp. We shall work day and night to undo this experiment.
- You must let me go to him.
- Only when he's well again.
No, now. I can do far more with Jack than you or Dr Kemp.
But, Flora, he's not normal.
His mind's unhinged. At present he's mad.
I can persuade him to help you.
You're powerless unless he does.
- I'll be ready in five minutes.
- Wait till the morning.
It's life or death, Father. You know that.
- I'll go alone, then.
- Flora.
Who's that? Who's that? unlock the door, Kemp.
Let me in.
- What are you doing here, Kemp?
- I couldn't sleep.
I had to get up and come down.
- Why did you lock the door?
- I... I was afraid.
Wouldn't you be afraid if I were invisible like you?
There's no need to be afraid, Kemp.
We're partners. Bosom friends.
We've a busy day ahead.
You must sleep.
I see. You told the police.
That was why you went downstairs.
No, I didn't. I swear I didn't.
Look, it's not the police.
It's Dr Cranley and Flora.
Flora.
- Why, yes, of course.
- I had to tell them you were back, Griffin.
- Flora was nearly mad with anxiety.
- How could I forget?
Shall I let them in?
Yes, of course you must let them in.
I shall go and prepare myself in my room.
I shall see Flora. Alone.
- He knows you're here.
- He was asleep.
He saw you from the window.
He wants to see Flora alone.
- No, Flora, don't.
- He's calm now, and quiet.
- Jack won't do me any harm.
- He's insane.
It's for us to cure him - Kemp and I.
Keep away, Flora.
I must go to him.
Doctor, he was a different man when he saw Flora leave the car.
He won't hurt her. We must play for time.
- Why for time?
- We... we must prepare things.
If we try and bind him now, he'll escape.
We must take him when he's asleep and chloroform him. Wait here.
- Flora, my darling.
- Thank God you're home, Jack.
I would have come to you at once,
Flora, but for this.
How wonderful it is to see you.
How beautiful you look.
That funny little hat. I always liked it.
- You've been crying.
- I want to help you. Why did you do this?
- For you, Flora.
- For me?
Yes, for you, my darling.
I wanted to do something tremendous, to achieve what men of science have dreamt of since the world began, to gain wealth and fame and honour, to write my name above the greatest scientists of all time.
I was so pitifully poor.
I had nothing to offer you, Flora.
I was just a poor, struggling chemist.
I shall come back to you,
Flora, very soon now.
The secret of invisibility lies there in my books.
I shall work in Kemp's laboratory till I find the way back.
There is a way back, Flora.
And then I shall come to you.
I shall offer my secret to the world, with all its terrible power!
The nations of the world will bid for it - thousands, millions.
The nation that wins my secret can sweep the world with invisible armies!
Jack, I want you to let my father help you.
You know how clever he is.
He'll work with you until you find that second secret that'll bring you back to us.
Then we'll have lovely, peaceful days again out under the trees, after your work in the evening.
Your father? Clever?
You think he can help me?
He's got the brain of a tapeworm, a maggot, beside mine.
Don't you see what it means? Power.
Power to rule, to make the world grovel at my feet.
Jack, listen to me. Listen!
My father found a note in your room.
He knows something about monocane you don't.
It alters you, changes you, makes you feel differently.
Father believes its power will go if you know what it is.
Come and stay with us.
Let's fight this thing out together.
Power, I said.
Power to walk into the gold vaults of the nations, into the secrets of kings, into the holy of holies.
Power to make multitudes run squealing in terror at the touch of my little invisible finger.
Even the moon's frightened of me, frightened to death.
The whole world's frightened to death.
So, I see. Kemp couldn't sleep.
He had to go downstairs.
He was frightened.
I put my trust in Kemp.
I told him my secret and he gave me his word of honour.
- You must go now, Flora.
- I want to help you.
There is nothing for you to do except to go.
I shall come back. I swear I shall come back, because I shall defeat them.
- Go now, my dear.
- No. I want to stay. You must hide.
Don't worry.
The whole world's my hiding place.
I can stand out there amongst them in the day or night and laugh at them.
Come along, my darling.
Oh, Father!
Link hands, all around the house.
- Link hands.
- Link hands.
- Link hands.
- Link hands.
Keep close together, or he'll slip under your arm.
Now, boys, forward.
Thank you, Kemp, for opening the window.
You're a true friend, Kemp. A man to trust.
I've no time now but, believe me, as surely as the moon will set and the sun will rise,
I shall kill you tomorrow night.
I shall kill you even if you hide in the deepest cave of the earth.
At ten o'clock tomorrow night
I shall kill you.
Help! Help!
He's here! He's here!
- Here he comes.
- Stand where you are.
- What is it?
- Something smacked my face.
Naughty boy.
Ow! Let go!
- What's the matter with you?
- He twisted my nose.
Now, steady, boys.
We've got him all right this time.
Good shot.
Get that hat.
Now then, boys, advance slowly.
It's all right. He's unarmed.
We've got him easy.
Help! Help! He's got me by the feet!
Here he is! Help!
It's the invisible man! He's got him by the feet! After him! Quick!
What do you know about that?
Help!
Murder! Murder!
' Here we go gathering nuts in May, nuts in May, nuts in May
' Here we go gathering nuts in May on a cold and frosty morning
Whoops!
He threatened to kill me at ten o'clock tonight. You must lock me up.
You're not the only one in danger, Dr Kemp.
I'll see that you have protection.
Now, Dr Cranley, you're concealing something from me.
One moment.
Why were you and your daughter in this house at two o'clock this morning?
Dr Kemp called me up.
He told me the man was here.
- He wanted my help.
- Why did he ring you before the police?
- Why did your daughter come too?
- She came to drive the car.
You know who the invisible man is, Doctor.
I understand you have another assistant besides Dr Kemp, a Dr Griffin.
- Where is Dr Griffin?
- He's gone away.
It is Griffin!
What's the good of concealing it?
It's Griffin, and he's threatened to murder me.
He may be here now, in the garden looking through the window, or in the corner of my bedroom waiting for me, waiting to kill me!
And you all sit there doing nothing! Nothing!
We've doubled the search party around Kemp's house.
Nothing to report, sir. The policeman's trousers were found a mile away.
- That's all.
- Well, it's beaten me.
I'll give £1,000 for a practical idea.
He's roaming the country at will, a madman.
Here I am.
Aren't you pleased you've found me?
Aagh!
Would you like to keep him company?
Stand away! Keep back!
Thank you.
- Give me £5 worth of silver, please.
- Yes, sir.
Thank you. Good day.
- Morning.
- Morning, sir.
There you are. A present from the invisible man.
Money! Money! Money! Money!
' up and down the City Road
' In and out the Eagle
' That's the way the money goes
' Pop goes the weasel!
Money! Money! Money! Money!
20 men of the search parties have been killed, and 100 in the train disaster.
The invisible man has been reported in a hundred different places.
Now I appeal to you to help us keep the public calm.
What plans have you got for capturing him?
100,000 men are searching and watching.
But have you any special secret means of getting him?
The police have offered £2,000 for the first effective means.
- Why not bloodhounds?
- The bloodhounds have lost the scent.
Why not put wet tar on all the roads, then chase the black soles of his feet?
Because he's not a fool.
Now, we've got one hope, gentlemen.
But I daren't say a word of it here.
He may be standing there beside you listening.
Try and sleep now, my dear.
There's nothing you can do.
We must just pray that the police can take him without harming him.
Stand back, close against the wall.
Now then.
Drag that net clear across the room.
Now everything depends on the way we carry out my plan.
I'll tell you it after we've made certain he's not in this room.
Good. Now we're safe here at last.
Constable, keep an eye on that window.
Now, come here. All of you, sit down.
Now listen carefully. We've got a chance tonight that will never come again.
He's threatened to murder
Dr Kemp at ten o'clock.
From what we know of him, he'll do his utmost to carry that out.
He's certain to be near this house, watching, for some time beforehand.
Now, at half past nine,
Dr Kemp, with a bodyguard of police, will leave this house and walk down to the police station.
It's a natural thing for Dr Kemp to seek protection.
The invisible man is certain to be near.
He's certain to see what's happening.
You mean you're going to use me as a bait? I can't!
- You must. You'll be perfectly safe.
- Safe? He's not human.
- He can go through prison walls.
- Don't be a fool.
I can't sit in that station waiting.
He'll kill you, kill you all, and then take the keys and come to me.
Very well. If you're afraid of waiting in the police station, you can leave it directly you're inside.
There's a secret way out through the inspector's house.
We'll disguise you as a policeman and you can walk out and drive away.
Even if he sees you, he won't recognise you.
He'll probably be waiting to break in at ten o'clock.
- What happens to me then?
- I'll have you driven quietly back here.
Then get into your car and drive away into the country, miles away, and stay there until we've got him.
Now, you needn't be afraid.
We'll get him all right this time.
I'll lay traps that even an invisible man can't pass.
You see? It covers a fairly wide range.
Now, I've got 20 of these guns and a good man to each.
One splash of this on his skin and we've got something to follow at last.
- Why not paint the top of the wall?
- Because he'd smell it.
I've got a better plan. I'm going to put a thin layer of loose earth on top of the wall.
The slightest touch will disturb it, and we've got him trapped.
Oh, I see. Pretty good.
Quick march!
They think they're very clever.
All right, take him straight inside.
20 minutes to ten.
Keep your eyes open now, boys.
Here, quick, sir.
I heard footsteps outside, soft footsteps, like naked feet.
Listen.
Come on.
- Where are you going to?
- The mountains, 100 miles away.
Drive away quickly.
It's ten minutes to ten.
He's bound to do something in a minute.
- Will he try and get into the station?
- Every door and window is barred.
No, he'll try the wall right enough.
There he goes!
- Go to your stations now. Watch the wall.
- He's over the wall!
I felt breathing down my neck.
He's in here.
Ten o'clock!
Ten o'clock he wanted to murder me.
I think this'll do nicely, Kemp.
We'll stop here.
It's ten o'clock.
I came with you to keep my promise.
No! It's all a mistake, Griffin.
I swear I never told the police. I want to help you. Let me be your partner.
I've had a cold and uncomfortable journey just to keep my promise at ten o'clock.
I went into the police station with you.
I stood by while you changed into that coat.
I rode on the running board of the car that took you home again.
There. You sit there.
I've got you where I want you.
I hope your car's insured. I'm afraid there's going to be a nasty accident.
A very nasty accident.
- I'll do anything. Everything you ask me.
- You will? That's fine.
Sit where you are. I'll get out and take the handbrake off and give you a little shove.
You'll run down and through the railings.
Then you'll have a big thrill for 100 yards till you hit a boulder.
Then you'll do a somersault and break your arms, then a grand finish-up with a broken neck.
Well, goodbye, Kemp. I always said you were a dirty little coward.
You're a dirty, sneaking little rat as well. Goodbye.
1,000 replies have come to my appeal for ways of catching the invisible man.
Some are clever, some stupid, but all are impossible.
He's got to sleep.
They might catch him asleep.
- He's got to eat and drink.
- A café was robbed last night in Manton.
There's no proof he did it.
There are robberies every night by ordinary burglars.
This feels good.
Look there. We wanted help - there it is.
It's now or never. The snow won't lie long at this time of year.
It may be gone in a few hours.
Norton, find out if the snow is yet all over the country.
Send out a broadcast message.
He can't stay out in this bitter cold.
He'll seek shelter.
Excuse me, sir.
There's breathing in my barn.
What do you mean, breathing in your barn?
The invisible man, sir.
Sure as I stand here.
The farmer may have imagined it, but we can't leave it to chance.
Surround the barn.
No use trying to take him on the inside.
Force him out into the snow. Take some wood and gasoline and set fire to it.
That's it, sir. He's in there under a pile of straw, sir.
Are there any windows he can watch from?
No, sir. Only the door, sir.
There's a reward of £1,000 waiting for you if we're successful.
We're lucky to have the open country.
Take your men and cover the country from the road to the hill.
Line the ridge through those trees.
There's no time to lose. We can't wait till he comes out to search for food.
We must fire the barn at once and drive him out into the snow.
Keep in single file. We don't want a lot of your footprints around the barn.
We want to keep the snow for his feet alone.
Get that searchlight on the door of that barn.
He's out! Look!
Shall I give the signal to advance?
I don't think your guard is needed any longer.
- How is he?
- He's very near the end.
- Are you Dr Cranley?
- Yes. I got word to come immediately.
Towards dawn this morning he grew quiet.
He called the name of a girl -
I understand, your daughter.
She's waiting below. Is there any chance?
The bullet passed through both lungs.
It's impossible to treat the wound.
Do you think your daughter could bear to go to him?
I'm afraid the end may be rather terrible.
The effect of the drugs will die with him.
His body will become visible as life goes.
I'll bring her now.
- Is Flora there?
- She's coming now.
I knew you would come to me, Flora.
I wanted to come back to you.
My darling.
I failed.
I meddled in things... that man must leave alone.
Father, come quickly.
{3166}{3233}- Mr. Dragore, please.|- Oh, him.
{4143}{4175}No sound, please.
{4186}{4234}After two years, I find you.
{4259}{4302}I want the Eternal Light.
{4320}{4357}You've found me too late.
{4369}{4404}It's no longer mine.
{4550}{4637}I can kill with this from the end of the room.|No lies, please.
{4670}{4715}You cannot kill in England, Mahmoud.
{4728}{4798}They get their murderers here|and hang them.
{4825}{4860}I have not come alone.
{4862}{4905}If I hang, there are others.
{4916}{5007}The Eternal Light goes back|to the tomb from which you stole it.
{5010}{5090}- But I tell you, I have not got it.|- Please, I am not a child.
{5150}{5203}- I sold it.|- To whom did you sell it?
{5240}{5273}To Professor Morlant.
{5321}{5358}That robber of the dead?
{5415}{5440}Has he sold it?
{5442}{5487}- He did not buy it to sell.|- What then?
{5490}{5564}- Like you, Mahmoud, he believes.|- Believes?
{5573}{5673}He believes that the Eternal Light|will open for him the gates of paradise?
{5675}{5750}Even so,|he gave the best part of his fortune for it.
{5762}{5837}And, very soon,|he will know whether or not he was right.
{5842}{5873}What do you mean?
{5890}{5953}Professor Morlant is dying.
{6022}{6080}Then you think it will be buried with him?
{6084}{6115}I'm sure of it.
{6129}{6169}We have only got to wait...
{6174}{6205}until he is dead.
{6462}{6492}Anubis...
{6602}{6637}Opener of the way.
{7462}{7489}What's that?
{7704}{7745}- What is it?|- Good evening.
{7757}{7796}I stay in the neighborhood...
{7798}{7881}and, hearing of your master's illness,|I took the liberty of calling.
{7883}{7914}How is he tonight?
{7917}{7958}He'll never see the morning.
{7963}{8029}- He hasn't asked for anyone of my cloth?|- Nor will he.
{8032}{8109}He's set in his ways,|and they are the ways of the heathen.
{8111}{8153}I know he won't see the rector...
{8156}{8241}but though I'm a stranger,|I don't like to leave a man to die like that.
{8243}{8311}He'll die in his own fashion, as he has lived.
{8314}{8383}- Still, sometimes at the end...|- Not with him.
{8386}{8485}He's stubborn and unbending|and will be so at the throne itself.
{8528}{8571}I suppose I can be of no use then.
{8574}{8612}No manner of use.
{8714}{8740}Good night.
{9033}{9069}He's asking for you.
{9139}{9185}Where can I find Mr. Broughton?
{9537}{9562}Who is it?
{9570}{9601}Come in or go out.
{9838}{9901}You'll have to go up soon|if you want to see him again.
{10005}{10045}Curious house, this.
{10056}{10086}Curious owner.
{10090}{10189}Yes, but I suppose a great Egyptologist|can't be expected to be like other people.
{10197}{10250}He'll be like a great many other people soon.
{10253}{10306}That's not a very sympathetic thing to say.
{10310}{10351}I'm not a sympathetic man.
{10374}{10400}Want a drink?
{10455}{10519}- That's across the hall, isn't it?|- I dare say.
{10530}{10554}Thanks.

{12478}{12525}I want to see Laing.
{12575}{12605}I'm here.
{12704}{12742}Is the door shut?
{12751}{12778}It is.
{12812}{12861}- No listeners?|- None.
{12922}{12981}- The curtains?|- They are drawn.
{13050}{13083}Come nearer.
{13436}{13482}This man, Broughton...
{13528}{13556}Watch...
{13574}{13597}Broughton.
{13614}{13657}You were always suspicious.
{13670}{13728}Have you ever trusted a living soul?
{13741}{13776}Only fools.
{13843}{13881}I trust you.
{13903}{13972}Better to trust in the spirit than in the flesh.
{13982}{14032}I put my trust...

{14302}{14334}my funeral...
{14362}{14416}you will bury me at dusk...
{14444}{14500}in the clothes I told you.
{14536}{14601}You will place the figure of Anubis...
{14632}{14695}at the west of the inner chamber.
{14700}{14725}I will.
{14770}{14805}And on the night...
{14828}{14870}of the full moon...
{14938}{14981}at the first hour...
{15031}{15119}I will make my offering of the Eternal Light...

{15364}{15432}If I have done well in his sight...
{15494}{15589}those fingers will close over the jewel...
{15683}{15790}and he will open to me|the gates of immortality.
{15815}{15905}The hand of a heathen image|will not come to life.
{15947}{15980}The bandage...
{16970}{16993}Look.
{17113}{17196}This is the Eternal Light.
{17270}{17329}It must rest in my hand.
{17375}{17461}A man will not find peace|who robs his heirs.
{17489}{17533}Bandage my hand.
{17565}{17599}The Eternal Light...
{17614}{17655}must lie with me...
{17673}{17702}in the tomb.
{17729}{17770}You're afraid of me?
{17798}{17841}I'm afraid for you.
{17859}{17906}If this should leave me...
{17949}{18023}then you'll have reason to fear...
{18080}{18122}for when the full moon...
{18137}{18197}strikes the door of my tomb...
{18228}{18266}I will come back.
{18302}{18331}You hear?
{18357}{18430}I will come back to kill.
{18497}{18595}Bandage my hand.
{19570}{19597}Doctor!
{20141}{20168}Window...
{20219}{20243}open...
{21031}{21060}It's all over.
{21158}{21213}Make out a certificate: Heart failure.
{21311}{21385}What was the idea|of bandaging his hand like that?
{21410}{21437}I cannot say.
{21452}{21498}He had many a queer fancy.
{21556}{21626}I'll be round in the morning|to sign the certificate.
{21762}{21856}I'll not be leaving my master's side|till his body is laid to rest.
{21886}{21910}No.
{24552}{24587}Where are you going?
{24598}{24672}To feed the lamp that is to burn inside.
{27042}{27066}Wait!
{27094}{27141}You're leaving the key inside.
{27169}{27232}That was another of his queer fancies.
{27713}{27760}When your master died, Laing...
{27770}{27854}I believe him to have been possessed|of a jewel of great value.
{27879}{27917}Do you know anything about it?
{27924}{27949}Nothing.
{27954}{28048}- I advise you to be very careful, Laing.|- I have a careful nature.
{28050}{28126}You may be putting yourself|perilously near dishonesty.
{28147}{28189}I've seen men nearer.
{28390}{28430}You may regret this, Laing.
{29223}{29294}I want you to stay here|and watch that man with the clubfoot.
{29298}{29341}But I'm not a detective.
{29344}{29407}One more word from you, Davis,|and you're out of work.
{29424}{29509}I have reason to believe that he has stolen|a valuable piece of property.
{29514}{29562}He may make an effort to get rid of it.

{34106}{34166}I'm sorry, but when I'm angry, I do kick.
{34187}{34249}- Would you like to explain that?|- Yes, I intend to.
{34290}{34371}By your own statement, Miss Harlon and I|are the sole heirs of Uncle.
{34374}{34428}We were not informed|of his death or his funeral.
{34430}{34497}Your uncle died|and was buried in a certain way...
{34500}{34543}according to his wishes, which...
{34554}{34585}Need I go on?
{34595}{34685}Almost his last words|were a threat to return from the dead.
{34709}{34770}- In my opinion, he was mad.|- Well, that may be so.
{34773}{34820}Miss Harlon and I|should have been consulted.
{34823}{34889}I understood that you and her|were not on speaking terms.
{34891}{34951}So what?|You expect quiet at a funeral, don't you?
{34956}{34997}Yes, I also expected my offer.
{34999}{35073}I'm very sorry,|but this means a good deal to both of us.
{35076}{35154}- I thought he was worth about £4,000 a year.|- He isn't now.
{35161}{35201}What do you mean by that?
{35211}{35258}He spent a good deal, you know.
{35282}{35342}It may surprise you to know|that, some time ago...
{35345}{35403}he drew a check for £75,000.
{35410}{35439}What for?
{35448}{35473}I don't know.
{35486}{35557}You were in charge of all his affairs,|and you don't know?
{35560}{35589}That's what I said.
{35614}{35688}And I advise you to look after|the tone of your voice.
{35690}{35790}I'm not sure I haven't more important things|to look after than the tone of my voice.
{35794}{35824}I don't follow you.
{35836}{35905}I'm going to run down|to Earlsvale House tomorrow morning.
{35919}{35942}Yes, why...
{35959}{36018}I don't think you realize...
{36035}{36082}the conditions that you'll find there.
{36085}{36147}- No, that's why I propose to go.|- You won't like it.
{36164}{36208}You'll be most uncomfortable.
{36211}{36254}You don't advise me to go?
{36262}{36325}I think you'll be making a very big mistake.
{36356}{36385}Then I'll go.
{36422}{36505}By the way, does Miss Harlon know|anything about this will business?
{36507}{36581}No doubt she will have received|a letter from me by now.
{36587}{36632}- Do you know Miss Harlon?|- No.
{36654}{36726}I plan to have the pleasure|of calling upon her this evening.
{36794}{36818}Hello.
{36830}{36873}It's you, Davis. Wait a minute.
{36883}{36951}I have a visitor here,|but I think he's just going.
{36963}{36998}Thank you very much.
{37005}{37079}If you're going to see Miss Harlon tonight,|I shall be there, too.
{37082}{37169}No doubt you will succeed|in making a painful interview intolerable.
{37190}{37221}Good afternoon.
{37234}{37299}Your manner must help|your practice a great deal.
{37462}{37490}Now, Davis.
{37736}{37801}Can you direct me|to Blandford Street, please?
{37804}{37885}Follow the tramlines close on a mile|and then turn right at the church.
{37887}{37928}I'm obliged to you.
{38598}{38628}Hello, Kaney.
{38938}{38983}It's good to get out of that fog.
{38986}{39045}My dear, a most exciting thing|has happened.
{39067}{39107}Don't let it happen again.
{39110}{39190}No, not that. That's a chestnut. It's this.
{39226}{39269}It looks like a solicitor's letter.
{39272}{39315}It's just been delivered by hand.
{39318}{39373}Oh, dear? What haven't we paid?
{39383}{39437}I wonder if I'm gonna get a shock or not.
{39464}{39507}Kaney, that is a silly game.
{39541}{39592}After all we've said about Uncle Henry...
{39594}{39631}what do you think he's done?
{39634}{39687}- Something nice, at last?|- He's dead.
{39709}{39753}My dear, I'm sorry.
{39759}{39808}And his solicitor wants to see me.
{39810}{39849}My dear, I'm glad.
{39863}{39910}He was awfully rich, wasn't he?
{39925}{39967}He may have left you a fortune.
{39970}{40037}If he has, I'll buy you a private cinema.
{40045}{40101}I say, when did this letter come?
{40113}{40153}A few minutes ago. Why?
{40156}{40237}He asks me to telephone him|if I could see him here at 6:00.
{40256}{40337}You don't want to miss the chance|of a fortune for the sake of tuppence.
{40340}{40408}- You'd better run out and do it now.|- You're right.
{42985}{43029}- Miss Harlon?|- Yes.
{43941}{43964}What happened?
{43967}{44025}Somebody attacked me,|and snatched my bag.
{44029}{44106}- Why, good Lord, it's Betty Harlon.|- Ralph Morlant.
{44123}{44182}You would go and get yourself|into some kind of mix-up.
{44185}{44243}- You would arrive when it's all over.|- Thank you.
{44246}{44290}- I'm going home.|- Wait a minute.
{44298}{44350}I was on my way to see you,|strictly on business.
{44353}{44405}You wouldn't be allowed in|for any other reason.
{44408}{44432}That's good.
{45277}{45302}Taxi!
{45342}{45409}Penninghame Garage,|as quickly as possible.
{46188}{46224}So you've brought him.
{46234}{46303}Dear Mr. Broughton,|we're delighted to see you.
{46306}{46384}No, it isn't Mr. Broughton.|It's my cousin, Ralph Morlant.
{46386}{46464}Dear Mr. Morlant, we're delighted to see you.
{46470}{46523}Wrong again. We don't like him very much.
{46529}{46591}Don't we? I didn't realize.
{46603}{46677}- Our two families are not on speaking terms.|- Oh, dear.
{46683}{46773}As far as I can make out, it was started|by my late uncle as a Christmas joke.
{46784}{46838}- Won't you sit down?|- Thank you.
{46860}{46927}But now he's dead. The trouble's all over.
{46941}{46991}I'm not sure it hasn't just begun.
{47002}{47042}Where's Mr. Broughton?
{47047}{47099}He won't come, because I didn't telephone.
{47102}{47149}I nearly got throttled instead.
{47169}{47249}There was a man with a limp.|He pushed a note into my hand.
{47251}{47292}I just put it in my bag...
{47295}{47344}when somebody snatched the whole affair.
{47348}{47379}What was in it?
{47382}{47447}"There's something of value at Earlsvale.
{47461}{47520}"Others are after it, so come."
{47527}{47629}And Broughton was doing everything|he knew to keep me away from there.
{47639}{47691}There's a fox in the cover somewhere.
{47702}{47726}Goodbye.
{47755}{47784}Why "goodbye"?
{47797}{47865}I'm going there right away.|I'll let you know what happens.
{47868}{47950}You're wrong. I'll let myself know.|If you go, I go, too.
{47959}{47996}You can't do that.
{47999}{48083}Alone in a house with a man|you're not even on speaking terms with.
{48086}{48157}Don't be so absurd.|It's not as if I even liked him.
{48168}{48228}If another woman was going, perhaps.
{48230}{48317}- I suppose you want to come, too?|- Obviously, it's my duty.
{48324}{48366}And suppose I object?
{48383}{48445}I'm not so broke I can't hire a car.
{48470}{48539}All right, you win,|but for goodness' sake, hurry.
{48862}{48932}Girls, just get in as best you can.|There you are.
{49064}{49112}- You first!|- No, you. Hurry up.
{49221}{49260}This is an unspeakable car.
{49262}{49319}- There's no room for my legs.|- All right.
{49550}{49629}- It looks as if I'll have to walk.|- You might do worse.
{49635}{49702}There's a grand moon. It's full.
{51836}{51886}I'll see if there's a name on this gate.
{52010}{52056}There's nothing to show this is the place.
{52058}{52135}But there aren't any other places,|and I'm frozen.
{52144}{52196}It's no use going to the wrong place.
{52198}{52270}Wait. Here's someone on a bike.|Hi there, cocky, wait a minute.
{52335}{52387}I'm sorry. I didn't see you were a parson.
{52390}{52421}That's all right.
{52457}{52489}- Any trouble?|- No.
{52500}{52565}We just want to get to Earlsvale House.
{52574}{52607}This is it.
{52618}{52673}As a matter of fact, I'm calling there myself.
{52676}{52748}- Did you know my uncle, Professor Morlant?|- Slightly.
{52757}{52829}Perhaps I ought to introduce myself.|My name's Nigel Hartley.
{52832}{52903}- I'm down at Raveley. The vicar's ill.|- How do you?
{52926}{52963}I'm Ralph Morlant...
{52982}{53018}and this is Miss Harlon.
{53021}{53045}We're the heirs...
{53048}{53115}Couldn't we have the rest|of the introduction indoors?
{53118}{53160}Of course. You must be cold.
{53206}{53269}It's straight down this drive.|You go along, I'll follow.
{53271}{53296}All right.
{53938}{53967}Here we are.
{54127}{54173}The car will be all right here.
{54201}{54237}I'll show you the way.
{55450}{55489}What a horrible house.
{55515}{55569}I wish I was back home in bed.
{55626}{55666}I can hear someone coming.
{55954}{56005}Don't stand about. Come inside.
{56808}{56848}We'll go into the library.
{57613}{57706}I may be old-fashioned, but I feel awkward|when I'm not introduced to people.
{57713}{57780}I'm sorry. I forgot you didn't know|your clients by sight.
{57822}{57874}- This is Miss Harlon.|- How do you do?
{57886}{57947}I was expecting|a telephone message from you.
{57954}{58000}I was on my way to call you up...
{58004}{58063}when the most extraordinary|thing happened.
{58126}{58155}This is Miss Kaney.
{58214}{58242}How do you do?
{58377}{58422}You're a surprise, Broughton.
{58442}{58510}I have a great deal of business|to clear up down here.
{58513}{58596}This house has needed a woman|for about 25 years.
{58647}{58689}Now I've blinded myself.
{58714}{58778}You haven't wasted much time|in getting here.
{58781}{58835}No, just a little too much, perhaps.
{58842}{58922}Whatever do you mean?|Really, you're the rudest man alive.
{58939}{58985}Oh, pretty pussy!
{59013}{59058}How horrible! It's stuffed.
{59074}{59129}I dare say, you know|your own business best...
{59131}{59183}but why you should want|to bring a parson in...
{59186}{59263}- A pure accident. We met at the gates...|- So you brought him in.
{59266}{59353}- I can stand a certain amount, but no more.|- Don't let's make a battle of it.
{59606}{59651}- You stay here in the car.|- No.
{59662}{59731}I shall be among the trees, watching.
{60041}{60101}You may say I have no right|to express this opinion...
{60104}{60178}but to my mind,|it's a scandalous and disgraceful burial...
{60181}{60235}which may have disastrous consequences.
{60238}{60306}It'd be very disastrous|if he came back, wouldn't it?
{60309}{60377}- I quite see Mr. Hartley's point.|- You make friends quickly.
{60379}{60457}- And enemies quicker.|- Need we have these childish squabbles?
{60475}{60533}We all know that dead men don't come back.
{60637}{60687}I wish I was back home in bed.
{60700}{60764}- Hadn't somebody better answer that?|- Certainly.
{60774}{60818}- It's your house.|- Very well.
{61010}{61045}I'm sorry to disturb you.
{61048}{61112}But I was an intimate friend|of Professor Morlant.
{61155}{61222}You'd better come in.|We seem to be giving a party.
{61264}{61293}Thank you.
{61585}{61639}My name is Aga Ben Dragore.
{61648}{61679}An Egyptian?
{61690}{61719}An Arab.
{61722}{61774}I don't remember having heard your name.
{61778}{61831}I did not flatter myself that you would...
{61834}{61916}but I knew Professor Morlant|some years ago in Egypt.
{62152}{62189}I heard of his death...
{62200}{62249}and of his burial in my own faith.
{62262}{62325}I hoped, as I'm leaving England tomorrow...
{62328}{62388}that I might be allowed to visit his tomb.
{62418}{62473}I must protest against anything of the sort.
{62475}{62549}Why shouldn't the poor man|look at his friend's tomb?
{62558}{62596}I don't mind him going.
{62608}{62689}I can't believe|that you'd willingly encourage paganism.
{62692}{62742}The Egyptians were not pagans, sir.
{62769}{62821}As no doubt you know, Miss...
{62838}{62865}Kaney.
{62891}{62974}I think you're all being very unkind|to Mr. Dragore.
{62984}{63085}I don't think you people realize quite|how far Morlant's queer ideas took him.
{63094}{63152}He believed that after his death,|at a certain hour...
{63154}{63238}the image of Anubis would come to life|in his tomb and receive his soul.
{63246}{63281}It's horrible.
{63298}{63343}Well, I can't see that it matters.
{63346}{63416}After all, if that sort of mumbo jumbo|gave him any comfort...
{63418}{63459}It matters a great deal.
{63462}{63544}If my suggestion is likely to hurt|anyone's feelings...
{63567}{63592}please forget it.
{63595}{63678}I think that's very sweet of you, Mr. Dragore.
{63698}{63758}Your sympathy is more than charming.
{63804}{63893}Well, what about a cup of coffee,|after your cold drive?
{63907}{63971}I dare say, we should find some|in the kitchen.
{63981}{64059}May I offer my services as pantry man?
{64084}{64126}Quite sweet of you.
{64206}{64241}Come, Mr. Dragore.
{64303}{64403}Her sheer speed! She'll not let him out|of her sight for a moment, now.
{64406}{64450}Perhaps that's just as well.
{64482}{64548}Come along, Betty,|how about making a fire in the library?
{64550}{64575}Yes.
{64595}{64653}I'm sorry there should be|this sort of atmosphere.
{64655}{64724}After all, we're only ships|that pass in the night.
{64739}{64793}Do you want a drink, or will you pass now?
{64814}{64853}Well, thank you very much.
{65033}{65062}There you are.
{65350}{65417}If you build it that way,|there won't be any draft.
{65422}{65506}It'll be the only place in this house|where there isn't one, then.
{65518}{65600}Don't you think you carry|those snappy retorts a trifle too far?
{65603}{65700}Since we met, I can't remember you|saying a kind word to anyone.
{65705}{65760}Perhaps you're right. I'm sorry.
{66002}{66034}Six cups.
{66051}{66087}That's just...
{66100}{66139}four too many.
{66212}{66253}Tell me about Egypt.
{66281}{66326}Have you ever seen a sheik?
{66371}{66399}I am one.
{66600}{66629}Thank you.
{66674}{66723}Then how should I address you?
{66751}{66829}I'm cutting sandwiches for a sheik.
{66855}{66895}I don't feel quite well.
{66907}{66939}Don't be alarmed.
{66950}{67013}We're not quite as uncivilized|as people think.
{67022}{67056}Don't say that.
{67096}{67149}Do you ride a white stallion?
{67157}{67183}Sometimes.
{67202}{67254}Down the path of the moon...
{67268}{67362}the noble animal,|plunging and frothing at the nostrils...
{67371}{67450}till it founders at your feet,|faithful unto death.
{67458}{67493}Well, not very often.
{67496}{67548}You see, it's rather too expensive.
{67566}{67645}I know it's not your fault.|We were taught to hate one another, but...
{67648}{67692}You don't think I hate you, do you?
{67694}{67749}I can't somehow feel I'm your dearest friend.
{67774}{67824}You never did have a great deal of sense.
{67826}{67859}That's nice.
{67920}{68009}Ralph, I have a woman's intuition|that you and I are up against things.
{68040}{68128}- I'm pretty sure we are.|- Well then, let's cut the quarrelling.
{68134}{68184}Shoulder to shoulder? All right.
{68210}{68234}Partners.
{68618}{68693}Well, what a wonderful night.|It's a full moon.
{69090}{69149}Scared of a dead man in his tomb?
{69178}{69210}Shame on yourself.
{69281}{69379}Are you a child, that your knees|should rattle at the talk of a madman?
{69467}{69517}Look your enemy in the face.
{69542}{69606}It's the fear of the big door has got you...
{69611}{69684}and will hold you fast till you stare it down.
{69850}{69889}Do dead men walk?
{69922}{70004}I'm not thinking a dead man|will cross my path tonight.
{74214}{74251}I was dreaming.
{74270}{74347}Now I will show you|how we make coffee in the desert...
{74351}{74388}underneath the stars.
{74426}{74481}You don't make it yourself, do you?
{74487}{74531}No, of course not.
{74549}{74592}A Circassian slave...
{74594}{74673}Iovely as sin, cooks it for us, kneeling.
{74687}{74756}- And if it is not to our liking...|- I know!
{74781}{74834}She's stripped to the waist...
{74854}{74938}and lashed for miles across the Sahara.
{74950}{75042}Where she is finally eaten by locusts,|and rightly.
{75078}{75181}Now, take this canister,|and do exactly as I tell you.
{75234}{75269}And if I fail?
{75278}{75341}The Yorkshire moors are just behind us.
{75426}{75462}Six spoonfuls.
{75500}{75525}One!
{75614}{75640}Two!
{75732}{75758}Three!
{75808}{75833}Four!
{75867}{75893}Five!
{76117}{76194}Get off, you! Get your arms away from me!
{76275}{76339}What's the matter with you? Are you mad?
{76502}{76578}What was the matter with him? Was it drink?
{76581}{76625}No. Terror!
{76646}{76681}Stark terror!
{76699}{76741}Then I've caught it.
{76758}{76786}You stay here.
{76803}{76837}I'll look after him.
{76851}{76936}If you must look after somebody,|why look further?
{76990}{77016}Come on, then.
{77161}{77228}Ralph! That limp! I'd swear to it anywhere.
{77607}{77637}That's the man.
{77758}{77840}- Did you give a note to this young...|- Get your things and get out of here!
{77843}{77895}The master, I've seen him!
{78135}{78192}- Who screamed?|- I did.
{78194}{78293}That's the last time I'll ever try|to make coffee in a strange house.
{78295}{78345}That man with the limp, who was he?
{78351}{78413}Laing, your uncle's servant.
{78432}{78473}Well, he seemed mad to me.
{78709}{78737}Yes...
{78751}{78788}and probably dangerous.
{78813}{78873}Go into the library. I'll have a word with him.
{78876}{78951}Yes, come along.|Mr. Broughton understands the man.
{79312}{79376}It would do no harm|to warn my man to stand by.
{79378}{79436}Your man? Is he a sheik, too?
{79439}{79524}No, he's a chauffeur.|He's outside now with my car.
{79640}{79691}You're not leaving us, are you?
{79737}{79781}My dear lady.
{80000}{80066}Not a very courageous person,|our foreign friend.
{80090}{80132}You think he's run away?
{80146}{80174}Absurd!
{80187}{80286}I'd like to see you riding your bicycle,|with a Circassian slave, lovely as sin...
{80289}{80323}across the handlebars.
{80329}{80400}- What on earth are you talking about?|- Listen, good people.
{80402}{80488}Don't you think we're allowing this thing|to get on our nerves?
{80492}{80569}Don't you think if we took a grip|on our self control...
{80572}{80620}Now, listen, good parson...
{80622}{80711}this is our show, and our nerves|are probably as good as the next man's...
{80714}{80769}so keep that sort of talk to your pulpit.
{80772}{80835}I have no wish to interfere|where I'm not wanted.
{80838}{80894}Then don't. This is not a Sunday school.
{81027}{81083}After that, I think I can say good night.
{81098}{81128}As you please.
{81254}{81308}I'm sorry I was offensive. Good night.
{81310}{81389}The tongue is an unruly member, is it not?
{81400}{81424}Yes.
{81650}{81692}I was tempted...
{81758}{81801}but I did not fall.
{82057}{82093}I did not fall.
{82114}{82190}The thing's safe, I swear it.
{82302}{82372}When you told me|you'd come back from the grave...
{82376}{82415}how could I believe you?
{82426}{82486}I never knew such things could be.
{83500}{83568}I have not got it!
{83583}{83639}The girl, she has it!
{83651}{83682}I swear it.
{84333}{84423}What on earth's the matter with you?|You look as if you've seen a ghost.
{84426}{84453}I have.
{84493}{84587}I saw Morlant as plainly as I see you.
{84627}{84671}I'm gonna mix myself a drink.
{84875}{84922}Betty, just a minute.
{84994}{85019}Well?
{85033}{85093}I think they're trying to scare us|out of this house.
{86712}{86768}There's no use blinding ourselves|to the facts.
{86770}{86819}There must be something big at stake.
{86822}{86882}Something that depends|on getting rid of us?
{86894}{86935}That's how it looks to me.
{86943}{86986}But what are we going to do?
{88810}{88836}Who's there?
{88988}{89052}- I'm going down to that tomb and find out...|- What does...
{89054}{89113}It's the only way to find out|what's going on here.
{89117}{89185}I don't want to be left here alone.|Can I come, too?
{89209}{89275}There's nothing wrong with your nerve.|Come on.
{89532}{89604}- I'll put on a pullover and thicker shoes.|- All right.
{89617}{89652}- Is this yours?|- Yes.
{89655}{89701}I'll keep an eye on Broughton.
{90045}{90149}You have every chance of seeing things|if you lower Scotch at that pace.
{94175}{94228}Mr. Dragore!
{94329}{94361}There you are.
{94377}{94445}Mr. Dragore, I'll come up to you.
{94543}{94582}Wait, I'll come down.
{94734}{94805}- What do you want?|- There was somebody in the library.
{94807}{94849}- Who?|- I don't know.
{94867}{94906}The door, it shut!
{94934}{94963}Don't scream.
{94982}{95024}That's what I need!
{95026}{95106}The command in your wonderful voice.
{95202}{95229}Come with me.
{95250}{95320}I think you've gone far enough|with your insinuations.
{95322}{95377}Yes, and I may go a great deal farther.
{95433}{95491}- What is it? What's the matter?|- I've seen him.
{95659}{95724}Now perhaps you'll believe what I told you.
{95730}{95768}Get me a glass of water!
{97257}{97323}Thanks. I wasn't hurt, only frightened.
{97359}{97422}Broughton, see if you can find Miss Kaney,|will you?
{97521}{97606}It's wonderful to be with a man|who isn't afraid.
{97609}{97637}I am afraid.
{97640}{97725}You, who have ridden bareback|over the desert...
{97738}{97821}If you don't stop chattering,|I am afraid I shall have a knife in my back.
{97824}{97881}When I'm with you, I have to talk.
{97885}{97940}It comes, like poetry.
{97961}{98003}Are you prepared to obey me?
{98014}{98047}In anything.
{98059}{98096}Then close your eyes...
{98110}{98170}and don't speak for 10 seconds.
{99257}{99325}- We all panic sometimes.|- I felt his hands on me.
{99327}{99397}- That's why I know it was no ghost.|- It was no ghost.
{99433}{99505}Look at the clock. It's nearing the hour.
{99516}{99565}I know where you'll find him now.
{99580}{99669}He's gone back to the tomb,|to his heathen gods.
{99720}{99760}You and I will follow him there.
{99762}{99789}Wait a minute.
{99802}{99880}- What's his doctor's telephone number?|- Yoxford, 72.
{101461}{101520}Look! The door's open, and there's a light.
{101529}{101593}I'll go no nearer.
{101665}{101706}I can see a shadow moving.
{101709}{101772}- I'll go no nearer.|- Well, then, go back.
{101833}{101870}What about it, Betty?
{101879}{101909}Do we go on?
{101930}{101961}Yes, of course.
{102001}{102040}Thought you'd say that.
{104755}{104781}Look!
{105084}{105161}Hartley! So you're not a parson.|Just a dirty crook.
{105283}{105335}You'd better get out of my way.
{105347}{105410}Your hand! So that's how it was done.
{105453}{105516}- I wouldn't come any nearer.|- I don't have to.
{105695}{105719}Look!
{105721}{105784}If you please. Thank you. Come on, now.
{107553}{107577}Door.
{107753}{107824}- It's too late. Are you badly hurt?|- No, it's nothing.
{107848}{107880}Come and sit down.
{107900}{107950}- Where's the key?|- He threw it away.
{108185}{108247}When I phoned the doctor,|I told him to bring the police.
{108249}{108288}They ought to find us somehow.
{108290}{108373}Even if they do come,|how can they break down that door?
{108481}{108515}They'll find a way.
{108623}{108652}I'll make a bandage.
{108877}{108943}The doctor in charge|didn't understand the case.
{108949}{109001}- I'm afraid of catalepsy.|- Meaning?
{109004}{109044}Morlant was buried alive.
{109071}{109150}Mr. Dragore, what were those shots?
{109159}{109217}- Out of my way.|- Where are the others?
{109224}{109254}Leave me alone.
{109791}{109844}I thought you might be leaving in a hurry...
{109846}{109913}with something in your pocket|that doesn't belong to you.
{109917}{109946}Hand it over.
{109981}{110004}You win.
{110251}{110300}That woman! There she is!
{110303}{110360}- Come now.|- Put down that gun, you fool.
{110362}{110402}I tell you, she's got it.
{110492}{110520}Come on, then!
{110745}{110770}Stop!
{110789}{110868}- Now, Miss Kaney, if you please.|- I don't think so.
{110870}{110900}You fool.
{110905}{110989}If either of you two horrible men|so much as move...
{110995}{111023}in it goes.
{111025}{111126}- You don't know the value of that jewel.|- I don't care for the value. It'll go.
{111161}{111212}And if you shoot, I'll go with it.
{111239}{111264}I mean it.
{111278}{111376}Down 30 feet, and about 60 feet of water...
{111426}{111468}and then Australia.
{111533}{111618}I can't see to tie this.|That light seems much lower.
{112048}{112126}Hartley! Quick, come on! Get up!|Get him out of here!
{112269}{112329}- The door!|- Shut!
{112371}{112453}The flames! They mustn't reach the door!
{112811}{112865}It's no good. You can't breathe in there.
{112932}{112961}The cartridge!
{113009}{113034}Here!
{113043}{113068}If only...
{113245}{113294}I've had enough of this, Miss Kaney.
{113300}{113357}Supposing I'm ready to shoot,|and take the risk?
{113359}{113428}You'll be taking a bigger risk than you think.
{113454}{113499}- I'll take that gun.|- Now, look here.
{113501}{113561}That'll do. Now what's the trouble?
{113567}{113625}This, they're after it.
{113633}{113693}All of them. It belongs...
{113759}{113795}I'll carry her to the house.
{114060}{114090}Get back!
{114095}{114128}Back in that corner!
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Slow instrumental music]
[Talking in Tibetan]
[Shouting in Tibetan]
- What will you do if they won't go?
- Go on alone, of course.
[Arguing in Tibetan]
[Bell ringing]
[All shouting in Tibetan]
Pax vobiscum, my sons.
Et cum spiritu tuo.
FATHER: You're both English, are you not?
WILFRED: Yes.
You're the first white man we've seen in three months.
You two are the first I've seen in 40 years.
My name is Glendon.
This is my assistant, Hugh Renwick.
We're botanists.
HUGH: He's a botanist. I'm a nobody he brought along out of kindness.
HUGH: I wanted to see the last places on earth.
Why are you here?
We're looking for the Mariphasa lupina lumina... a strange flower which grows only in Tibet... and which, it is said, takes its life from the moon.
HUGH: Is there really such a flower, Father?
There are some things it is better not to bother with.
Why do you say that, Father?
- You aren't afraid, are you?
- No.
But I respect some of the superstitions of others.
Often they are founded in fact.
HUGH: Our coolies tell us, the valley we want to see is filled with demons.
WILFRED: Yes, I'm afraid they thought you were one of them.
That's why they ran away.
I've never been into that valley... and I've never known a man to return from it.
Then we were right. This is the place.
According to this map, it's just beyond that ridge... just off the trail.
- Are you game?
- Wish us luck, Father.
- Get the ponies.
- Right.
You are foolish... but without fools there would be no wisdom.
FATHER: Pax vobiscum.
WILFRED: Thank you, Father.
[Adventurous instrumental music]
Think of all the trouble we've been through these past six months... just for the sake of a little flower.
Yes. But it's the only one of its kind in the whole world.
We're going to go on climbing.
HUGH: I say, Glendon!
WILFRED: What?
I can't move! Something's holding my feet!
Nonsense. Lift them. Come on.
[Wolf howling]
- Are you all right now?
- I seem to be.
- What was the matter?
- I don't know.
It's the strangest feeling.
The sort you have in a dream.
Your feet won't move.
Don't let it get you, old boy.
Autosuggestion, self-hypnosis:
The basis of all superstition.
[Wolf continues howling]
[Wilfred groaning in pain]
What happened?
Something struck me.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Werewolf groaning]
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Slow instrumental music]
[Mechanical hissing]
Wilfred, what are you doing?
Sorry, dear. I lost all track of time.
Everybody's asking for you.
I've been working on an experiment.
What's the matter? Is something wrong? I mean, am I all right?
Dear old bear.
Nothing interests you anymore... except your mouldy old secrets in there.
Not even your wife.
I promise you, my darling... that as soon as I've completed that experiment...
I'll try to be more... Well, more human.
It isn't in you.
Ever since you came back from Tibet...
I've felt you were planning to divorce me and marry a laboratory.
I'll not only divorce you, but I'll beat you as well... if ever again you get me mixed up in a mess like this.
Don't blame me. Blame the Botanical Society.
I know, but I...
Here's Aunt Ettie. Let's get out... or she'll be battering down the doors. I'll have no secrets left.
Wilfred, how sweet of you to let us all in on you today this way.
Can you really make artificial moonlight?
I can't wait until I see your new laboratory.
Deadline, Aunt Ettie.
He won't even let me go in there.
Oh, Chanel. Sweet.
But you look a bit down.
What's the matter, Lisa?
My dear wife has just been scolding me.
Yes, how you manage to keep your dear wife is a mystery to me.
Skirmishing off the way you do.
Leaving her alone, months on end.
Anyhow, I knew the risk I took when I married... one of the black Glendons of Malvern.
Marrying any man is risky.
Marrying a famous man is kissing catastrophe.
Come on, Wilfred. See you later, Aunt Ettie.
Good heavens!
What is that wicked thing doing?
It trapped that poor, dear little fly.
It's going to eat that poor, dear little fly.
How revolting.
I wonder where is that horrible Madagascar plant?
The one that eats mice and men.
Mice and spiders, Miss Ettie.
It's over there. Shall we take a look?
- They'll be feeding it soon.
- No. I'll have my own tea first.
I may lose it after I've seen the thing... but I shall have it anyway.
Please don't yank me, Paul.
It irritates me to be yanked.
I'm sorry, Granny.
But I've just seen someone
I want to speak to. There she is.
ETTIE: Alice, darling.
ALICE: Oh, my dear, how are you?
- Do you know Mr. Renwick?
- How do you do?
- Mr...
- How do you do, Ames?
I must have my tea, quick.
My tongue is hanging out.
You do pick up the oddest phrases, don't you, Ettie?
I got that one from your delightful grandson here.
You take Lady Forsythe. I'll take Capt...
- Ames.
- Of course.
I never knew anyone... who could scuttle about as quickly as Ettie Coombes can.
ETTIE: Lisa.
Here's a young man who says he used to be a beau of yours.
Paul! I read you were in England.
LISA: I wondered if...
PAUL: Lisa, how great to see you again.
I simply adore to travel. Simply adore it.
He used to be a beau of hers.
I say, you've got a lovely garden here.
Haven't we?
I simply jitter to go to Java. Simply jitter.
Yes.
"Simply jitter to go to Java.
"I simply jitter to go to Java."
Wilfred, I want you to meet a very dear friend, Paul Ames.
How do you do, sir?
Mrs. Glendon and I used to throw jam in each other's hair as kids... and sail off the stable roof on improvised parachutes.
I've heard about your more recent exploits, as everyone has.
My wife never told me that she knew you.
- We've known one another for ages.
- Yes, quite a time.
Oh, yes. He proposed to her once.
When I was six, and he was twelve.
That was ages ago.
Are you planning on staying in England long?
No. I return to California on the fourth.
I've made my home there.
How does it feel to have a flying school of one's own?
To be able to hop across from San Francisco to Tokyo... in the twinkling of an eye?
At this moment, I ask nothing more of life.
Really?
A very enchanting mood to be in:
To ask nothing more of life.
Are you in that mood, Lisa?
Anyway, I'm in that mood.
All these lovely flowers about.
How true. Only God can make a daffodil.
The poet said, "Only God can make a tree," Aunt Ettie.
Isn't it just as difficult to make a daffodil, Wilfred?
Much more so.
Here's a nice, fat frog for you, my dear Carnelia. Here we are.
Ettie Coombes, what's happened?
- A plant just ate a frog.
- A what?
- A what?
- Frog.
Heretic! Bringing a beastly thing like that into Christian England.
Nature is very tolerant, sir.
She has no creeds.
Quite so.
May I congratulate you, sir... on the amazing collection of plants you've assembled here.
Thank you.
Evolution was in a strange mood...
- when that creation came along.
- Yes.
It makes one wonder... just where the plant world leaves off... and the animal world begins.
WILFRED: Have I met you before, sir?
In Tibet, once. But only for a moment...
- in the dark.
- In the dark?
Let me introduce myself again.
DR. YOGAMl: I am Dr. Yogami.
WILFRED: How do you do, sir?
Like yourself, a student, a nurturist of plants.
WILFRED: Dr. Yogami.
Pardon?
Do I understand you to say, that we met in Tibet?
Yes.
And unless I'm mistaken, we were both on a similar mission.
Yes?
Would it be intrusive if I should ask you...
- if you were successful?
- In what?
In obtaining a specimen... of the Mariphasa lumina lupina:
The phosphorescent wolf flower.
Well, you know... it blooms only under the rays of the moon.
My specimens died on the journey back.
As a scientist, sir, as a botanist... you actually believe that this flower...
- takes its life from moonlight?
- I do.
So far I've been unsuccessful... in persuading mine to bloom by moonlight... or any other kind of light.
Let me see them.
I'm very sorry.
I'll have to ask you to excuse me.
May I go along with you?
Lee!
- You'll pardon me?
- Of course.
No one's called me Lee for years.
So what's happened to you?
You were the gayest, happiest creature in the world once.
What's happened to you?
I have a toothache today.
I never seem to be able to rise above a toothache.
It makes me want to howl, break things... pull noses, tweak ears, screech.
Yes, you were always a good screecher as a child.
But I'll say this for you, you were truthful.
I'd hate to see you turn into a liar.
Liar?
Yes, it isn't a toothache that's troubling you today.
Won't you tell an old pal how to help?
How?
- Shut up.
- I see.
It's been great seeing you.
Now I'd better go and find Wilfred.
He's probably looking everywhere for me.
I can't bear to see you change like this.
You, who used to rear at the drop of a hat.
A wild pair we were, weren't we?
High-headed, hard at the bit, quick with the heels.
How we used to fight. Remember?
Yes. Where's all that lovely fight gone?
There's been no fight in me since the night we broke things off.
This flower is an antidote for what?
Werewolfery.
Lycanthrophobia is the medical term... for the affliction I speak of.
And do you expect me to believe that a man so affected... actually becomes a wolf... under the influence of the full moon?
No.
The werewolf is neither man nor wolf... but a satanic creature, with the worst qualities of both.
[Chuckling]
I'm afraid, sir, that I gave up my belief in goblins, witches... personal devils, and werewolves... at the age of six.
But that does not alter the fact... that in workaday, modern London today... at this very moment... there are two cases of werewolfery known to me.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
And how did these unfortunate gentlemen... contract this medieval unpleasantness?
From the bite of another werewolf.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
These men are doomed but for this flower... the Mariphasa.
LISA: There you are, Wilfred.
- Your wife?
- Yes.
This is my wife. Dr. Yogami.
How do you do?
May I visit your conservatories again one day?
- Of course, yes.
- Thank you.
What a strange man.
Yes.
See, man. See that moon vine.
That only blooms at night.
If I've deceived that vine, surely I can deceive Mariphasa!
I don't know, sir.
I got a feeling that Mariphasa ain't a human plant, sir... not like this vine.
Look.
Look, man!
What did I tell you?
And these two buds should bloom before tonight.
[Tense instrumental music]
WILFRED: Hawkins, go and get your dinner.
HAWKINS: Dinner, sir?
Go. Get out. You make me nervous.
Don't stand there staring at me all solemn and owl-eyed.
Yes, sir. Certainly.
[Tense instrumental music continues]
Of course, Mr. Plympton, you being a mere indoor person... has no idea of the mysteries of nature.
Most interesting, what you've been telling me, Mr. Hawkins.
And so them rings make moonlight, do they?
You have the idea, Mr. Plympton, in a manner of speaking.
Not that it's easy to grasp.
But there's a very scary thought, if you come to consider it.
Yes? And what might that be?
It don't leave nothing for heaven to do.
Quite so.
If you please, not on the glass, thank you.
Now, perhaps, you'll be good enough to go and tell Dr. Glendon... the missus is hoping he'll come in for tea.
Not a chance, I assure you, of his coming.
- Not a chance, Mr. Hawkins?
- Not a chance, Mr. Plympton.
Upstart.
Did you speak, Mr. Hawkins?
I did, Mr. Plympton, but not to you.
LISA: More tea?
PAUL: No, thanks.
- No, thank you.
- No, dear.
I have to get back to London before the evening traffic starts.
I'll never forgive you, Lisa, if you don't come to my party tonight.
Everyone in the world will be there.
Definitely everyone in the world.
I'd love to come... but it's impossible to get Wilfred to go anywhere.
Forget Wilfred.
Why don't you invite Paul to stay on for dinner?
And let him drive you into town afterwards.
- Yes, why don't you?
- I do.
I stay.
Ettie, dear, how did you find your new home?
I happened on it district visiting.
ETTIE: Come, darling.
Queen Elizabeth stayed there one night.
It's right on the river, in the midst of the sweetest slums.
So individual: Murderer's dens on one side, pubs on the other.
Is your party buffet or sit-down?
Buffet. The house is too small for sit-down.
How I loathe buffets.
Last week at Eva Trippet's...
I sat on a plate of salad, and no one told me.
What's the matter with you? Stop it.
PLYMPTON: Dr. Yogami.
[Dog barking]
LISA: How do you do?
Is Dr. Glendon at home?
My husband is working on an experiment. He can't see anyone.
- Perhaps I can see him later?
- I'm afraid not.
Lisa, who is this interesting-looking man?
Introduce him to me at once.
Dr. Yogami, my aunt, Miss Coombes.
- How do you do?
- I noticed you... at the botanical garden party and wondered who you were.
You must come to my party tonight.
Just a free and easy musical at my little bandbox in the slums.
Thank you, but I'm far too busy a man for pleasure.
Nonsense. Very busy men come to my parties.
Positively the busiest.
Lady Forsythe is bringing her son.
Could you find a busier man in all London... than the Chief of Scotland Yard?
ALICE: Time to scuttle, Ettie.
I must go. I'll see you tonight, Dr. Yokohama.
[Alarm buzzing]
Dr. Yogami, didn't they tell you that I wasn't seeing anyone today?
I thought, perhaps, you might see me.
- Come another day, please.
- Another day would be too late.
What will happen before morning,
I cannot say.
Tonight is the first night of the full moon.
Still harping on that old wives' tale of yours?
Would it were an old wives' tale.
Exactly what do you want of me?
Two blossoms of the Mariphasa flower in there...
- would save two souls tonight.
- Tonight?
But I thought you said the Mariphasa was a cure.
No. An antidote.
Effective only for a few hours.
Won't you let me see the results of your experiment?
Sorry. When my experiments are completed...
I will show the results to the entire world.
Not before.
Now, sir, I must wish you good day.
DR. YOGAMl: Then there is nothing more to be said?
Nothing.
Good day.
But remember this, Dr. Glendon.
The werewolf instinctively seeks to kill... the thing it loves best.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Slow instrumental music]
[Knocking at door]
Come in.
LISA: We're leaving now, Wilfred.
WILFRED: We?
I know it's a little early... but Paul wants to stop at his flat and change.
Had you planned on getting home?
PAUL: Naturally, I shall get Lee back.
WILFRED: Yes, of course. Thank you.
Darling, won't you change your mind and come with us?
WILFRED: I listened to all the childhood memories...
I care to hear for one night.
WILFRED: Run along, dear.
Run along and enjoy yourself.
I want you to see what I've done with that brocade you brought me.
Put off those beastly lights, I tell you!
Wilfred, what on earth's the matter?
Sorry, darling. I've been putting some medicine in my eyes... and the lights hurt them.
I just wanted you to see my coat.
WILFRED: Some other time, please.
LISA: Good night, Wilfred.
WILFRED: Good night.
PAUL: Good night, Dr. Glendon.
WILFRED: Good night, sir.
WILFRED: Lisa.
[Soft instrumental music]
Good night, my darling.
[Clock chiming]
[Sombre instrumental music]
[Growling ferociously]
[Tense instrumental music]
[Tense instrumental music continues]
[Lntense instrumental music]
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Growling]
[Singing] Scenes that are brightest
May charm
awhile
Hearts which are brightest
And eyes that smile
Lisa! Get off my train!
I hate it when I step on a train.
I shall take you home in a minute.
- Alice, my dear.
- Oh, my dear.
How amazing of you to succeed in bringing your son.
She's singing Scenes That Are Brightest.
She sings Botticelli divinely.
One doesn't sing Botticelli. One paints him.
Oh, yes. I forgot for the moment.
Lisa, dear. Charming. Paul, so good of you.
You two deep men should know each other.
Col. Forsythe, this is Dr. Yokohama.
FORSYTHE: We've met somewhere.
Yes.
[Tense instrumental music]
Don't you just love moonlight,
Dr. Yokohama?
Makes everything so peaceful.
Isn't it romantic to have the Thames lapping at your very threshold?
Sings me to sleep every night, positively.
That's the worst district in London over there.
Knife you for a shilling, positively.
But what difference?
I always say, everything is fate.
Don't you agree with me?
[Werewolf howling]
What's that?
A lost soul perhaps.
[Howling continues]
Let's go in.
What is it, Hugh?
Just a dog, out for a little or no good.
It isn't a dog. It's a lost soul.
[Ettie laughing]
I think we'd better get her upstairs, don't you?
My aunt is feeling a little ill, Dr. Yogami.
You know, you're a naughty girl.
Ettie Coombes, what's the matter with you?
One shouldn't drink at one's own parties.
But I get so nervous.
Ettie Coombes, you should go on the water wagon.
Now, you come along to bed.
PAUL: Don't worry. You'll be perfectly all right in the morning.
I'm so nervous. I want to lie down.
PAUL: Nothing to be nervous of.
LISA: Here we are.
Get to bed. You'll be okay in the morning.
ETTIE: I've been so frightened.
LISA: Open the window.
Yes, of course I will. Air will do her good.
Do you know she's nearly asleep now?
Come on. Let's go.
[Werewolf howling]
What's that horrible sound? What is it?
Well, if I were back on the ranch...
I'd say it was a coyote with a bad dream.
But in London, I don't know.
[Howling continues]
Can't tell me that's a dog.
You are quite right. It isn't a dog.
GUEST: I say, you're trembling.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Panting]
[Suspenseful instrumental music continues]
[Screaming]
PAUL: All right, I'll go.
Don't go up there, Mrs. Glendon.
Don't let any of the women come upstairs.
Just a moment. If you'll all stand back.
[Ettie continues screaming]
PAUL: What's the matter in here?
What's wrong?
The devil's been here. He had green eyes.
He clawed at me. He was covered with hair.
There, there. You've had a bad nightmare, that's all.
If anyone dares to tell me
I've been dreaming...
I shan't answer for the consequences.
Nobody will.
Come along.
You'll be much better if you sit down.
You sit down here. You'll be all right.
My wicked worldliness has caught up with me at last.
The Babu of Goroka always said it would.
There. Never mind.
I'm not here in my official capacity... but I think I can say with conviction... that no devil or any man has come through this window tonight.
Yes. I think our hostess has been mixing her drinks.
That's a very excellent deduction.
A horrible feeling. I've been like it myself.
We all do it at times.
It's getting quite late.
The party must be over.
Shall we have one before we go?
FORSYTHE: I'll have one.
- Lee, I'll wait for you.
- All right.
PAUL: Can I drop you anywhere?
[Tense instrumental music]
[Werewolf grunting]
[Sombre instrumental music]
- Anything else, sir?
- Nothing.
This flower looks to have slipped off and died on its own.
Whatever is it, sir?
I've never seen nothing like it.
Let that flower alone!
I meant no harm, sir.
It's only that I'm so fond of flowers... my fingers always want to touch them.
I'm sorry, Millie.
Here. Take these and buy yourself a pot of primroses or something.
Thank you, sir.
Go on, Jenkins. You heard the cries... and you ran in the direction from which they came.
Yes, sir. And bloodcurdling they was.
I took off as fast as anybody could... that was suffering from broken arches.
Broken arches acquired in the line of duty, sir.
It was some minutes before you located the fatality?
Good morning. I'm a little early.
FORSYTHE: No. Did you see the papers?
PAUL: No.
Just read this.
Go on, Jenkins.
At Goose Lane, me arches crack, and I come a cropper.
- Go on.
- Then I see what I see.
My stomach takes such a turn, my arches crack again.
Goose Lane.
This thing must have happened near Miss Ettie's house.
FORSYTHE: Yes, quite near.
There were wounds on the girl's throat... a wild animal might have made.
Well, if that wasn't a wolf I heard baying last night, I'm crazy.
You know, our dear Aunt Ettie... may not have mixed her drinks as badly as we thought.
In view of this occurrence...
I'm inclined to wonder myself whether there's any connection.
But whatever Miss Coombes saw, it wasn't a wolf.
No. Not in London. You may be sure of that.
I see I can't help you.
But I've only one other brilliant suggestion to make.
How about a werewolf then?
This is Scotland Yard, my boy, not Grimm's Fairy Tales.
"There are more things in heaven and Earth, Horatio." You know.
It's a funny thing. When I was flying in Yucatán last year...
- the authorities went cuckoo over...
- Who?
I beg your pardon, sir.
I mean, the authorities were gravely concerned... with a series of murders, not unlike this one... and they were always preceded by the howling of a wolf.
And then one night... they shot something slinking through the hills... and the murders ceased.
- They said it was a werewolf.
- Who were they?
All right.
But if any more of your citizens are found stark and cold... just remember, nephew warned you.
I think I might be able to persuade
Wilfred to go, too. Yes.
Anyhow I'll expect you, Paul.
Dinner at 8:00. Goodbye.
LISA: Good morning, Wilfred.
WILFRED: Good morning, dear.
LISA: I've just been talking to Paul.
LISA: He suggests that we all go for a moonlight ride tonight.
I'm sorry. I can't go.
There's something wrong, darling.
Very, very wrong.
Why do you say that?
Won't you tell me what it is?
Nothing. I shall be all right.
I wish we could burn that wretched laboratory... and everything in it.
LISA: Darling, you're not happy.
I know when you used to work... you were single-tracked and absorbed.
LISA: But you were thrilled, excited.
Now something about you frightens me.
Lisa, you mustn't say such things.
You're short-tempered with me now.
You never used to be.
You seem to have found someone sufficiently pleasant... to make up for it.
You're being utterly hateful.
I'm sorry.
Just bear with me a little while longer.
You really want me to go on that ride tonight?
- Lf you only knew how much.
- All right, then. I'll go.
I do love you, Lisa.
You know that, don't you?
Hawkins.
Yes, sir. Coming, sir.
You called, sir?
Hawkins, I've got to get away for tonight.
I want you to watch over things very carefully.
Yes, sir. I promise you, no more flowers will be stolen.
That I can and will promise you, sir.
But this bud, sir.
The moon lamp, it don't seem to bring it out, does it?
No.
Well, sir, the real moon will be out in a couple of hours.
Maybe that'll bring it out all right, sir.
That'll be too late, Hawkins.
That'll be too late.
WILFRED: I want you to keep the moon ray going.
HAWKINS: Yes, sir. Certainly, sir.
Wilfred, we'll have to hurry... if we want to see the moon rise over the Downs.
I can't go.
I've to go down to Leicestershire for a few days to see Bransby.
I'm sorry, sir.
I've just had a wire from him about a shipment of bulbs from Burma.
Can't you put it off until tomorrow, and ride tonight?
I can't. And you're not to go riding, either.
What?
- I forbid it, do you hear?
- Forbid it?
I can't have my wife gallivanting around the country... in the moonlight, with a total stranger.
Hardly that, Dr. Glendon.
I planned to ride, Wilfred, and I intend to ride.
Very well. If you must... then promise me that you'll get back before the moon rises.
Promise me that.
I'll promise you nothing of the sort.
I shall ride tonight, tomorrow night, the next night... in fact, every night there's a moon.
Come, Paul.
WILFRED: Don't go.
LISA: Of course I'm going.
[Lively tune playing on piano]
- Here's to you, Mrs. Moncaster.
- And here's to you, Mrs. Whack.
That's the first I've had today.
- How's your son, dearie?
- He's doing splendid.
Did I tell you he was a foreman in a pants factory?
- No.
- Yes.
And the warden says he's the best prisoner he's ever had... in the penitentiary.
I always knew that boy would amount to something.
Is your tripe tough, Mrs. Moncaster?
- Not at all.
- Mine is.
It ain't tripe you're eating. It's your veil.
Oh, Lord.
I want two gins for two ladies.
Two ladies?
Where's the other lady?
Man, what's the matter with your sight?
I'm the both of them.
I beg your pardon.
Could you tell me of anyone in this neighbourhood with rooms to let?
Try Mrs. Moncaster in there... the lady with the feathers, eating the plate of tripe.
- Thank you.
- He seems to have a secret sorrow.
Which one of you ladies has rooms?
I have. And most reasonable.
Three shillings a week for a gentleman.
And the rooms is splendid.
Don't you pay attention to the lying old hypocrite, sir.
Now, my rooms is...
That's my dearest friend, Mrs. Whack.
But she don't understand the ethics of business.
Now, are your intentions by the night or by the week?
- I'll take the room by the week.
- Then this way, sir.
It's just across the court.
Right here. This way.
If you'll follow me, sir.
It's going to be a fine night after all.
I do hate taking my plumes out in the wet.
Are you a single gentleman, sir?
WILFRED: Singularly single, madam.
More single than I ever realised is possible for a human being to be.
You don't say.
WILFRED: What would you say, if I were to tell you that it was possible... for a man to turn into a werewolf?
I'd say I was Little Red Riding Hood.
[Laughing]
There's my gilt and splendid parlour, sir.
You're single, and I'm single.
Ain't that a coincidence?
Ten years I was married to
Moncaster. Ain't seen him in 20.
He run away to Australia.
What a man he was.
Used to come home from his work all portered up... hit the baby with the plate, throw the gravy in the grate... spear the canary with a fork.
MRS. MONCASTER: And with his heavy hobnail boots... black-and-blue me from head to foot... and all because I forgot to have crackling on the pork.
Here's your room, sir.
Don't let this happen to me.
[Sombre instrumental music]
Father in Heaven, don't let this happen to me again.
If it must happen, keep me here.
Keep me away from Lisa.
Keep me away from the thing I love.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Werewolf howling]
[Lntense instrumental music]
Mrs. Moncaster.
Oh, you poor dear.
I'm sorry I hit you, Mrs. Whack.
Say no more about that, Mrs. Moncaster.
What's going on here?
He grips me, swipes me, swats me one in the breadbasket... and slams the door in me face.
Do you call that a gentleman?
I thought perhaps you might want some help. That's why I come in.
Strange noises have been coming from his room, Mrs. Whack.
I don't know what I've let myself in for.
I'd use me passkey and have a look.
Take a peek through the keyhole first.
[Mrs. Whack screaming]
WOMAN: Where have you been?
[Wolf howling]
WOMAN: I've been waiting more than
15 minutes for you to open the gate.
Them wolves have been acting queerly all night.
ALF: Hear them?
WOMAN: Wolves is nothing to me.
Give me a nice kiss, Alf.
[Growling]
I hadn't ought to do this.
Me with a wife and kids.
But you don't love your wife and your kids. You love me.
[Wolf howling]
Them blasted wolves.
What's the matter with them tonight?
What a fool you are.
A young fellow like you... tied to a white-faced, whimpering, scarecrow of a woman.
But you're going to leave her and come with me, ain't you?
Maybe.
[Wolf howling continues]
Wait a minute.
I've got to see what's happening.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Woman screaming]
Why, Mrs. Whack, what keeps you up so late?
I felt I couldn't go to bed, angel... without coming back to see how you was.
I ain't exactly bubbling.
- Is he back?
- Vanished as if he was air.
[Mrs. Whack laughing]
He must have been a hairy man.
I suppose you don't happen to have a nip about you anywhere.
No. Ain't it unfortunate?
[Werewolf howling]
He's back.
How did he get in?
I been sitting here all night.
Better go up and see what he's about now.
Put your eye to the keyhole.
And you keep off my jaw, Mrs. Whack.
MRS. WHACK: Why, Mrs...
[Mrs. Moncaster screams]
MRS. MONCASTER: Mrs. Whack.
MRS. WHACK: What is it?
MRS. MONCASTER: Come here.
Look.
[Mrs. Whack screaming]
Pull yourself together. Come on.
MRS. MONCASTER: I wonder if you saw what I saw... or if I saw what you saw.
MRS. WHACK: And I better run for the police.
No. We've seen something better left unsaid to the police.
- They might say we've been drinking.
- Maybe we have.
By any chance, did you find a bottle?
No, my love.
But if I saw what I thought I saw...
I've had my last bottle.
And it had better be the same with you.
Now, I'm speaking to you as a sister to a sister.
That's right. Now, that's...
[Werewolf howling]
[Both exclaiming]
Let's get inside.
MRS. WHACK: Shut it out.
[Door shuts]
Sorry, Tom.
Nice doings at the zoo.
What does The Herald say?
Usual thing: "What's the matter with Scotland Yard?"
What do the papers think we are?
The eyes that see all?
Old Forsythe's bobbing up and down like a balloon that can't land.
FORSYTHE: And, Evans.
EVANS: Yes, sir.
If I don't get a definite report on both these atrocities by 6:00 p. M...
I promise you, you'll all be seeking new professions by tomorrow morning.
- Good day.
- Good day, sir.
Uncle, this is Dr. Yogami of the University of Carpathia.
FORSYTHE: Sit down.
YOGAMl: Thank you.
FORSYTHE: Ever since the other night,
I've been wondering where I met you.
FORSYTHE: I called on you seven years ago... to enlist the resources of Scotland Yard... for an unfortunate mortal afflicted with lycanthrophobia.
FORSYTHE: Yes. I recall it.
You thought I was mad.
FORSYTHE: What can we do for you now?
Your department is trying to solve two murders.
There will be other murders tonight, and tomorrow night.
Also next month, when the moon is full again... unless you realise, sir, there is a werewolf abroad in London.
Yes, my nephew has similar ideas.
FORSYTHE: What do you want us to do about it?
You must seize the only specimen of the Mariphasa plant in England.
FORSYTHE: And where shall I get this posy?
In the private laboratory of Dr. Wilfred Glendon.
That flower is the only known antidote for werewolfery.
Yes, a very interesting folktale... but of no value to the police.
I warn you, sir... unless you secure this plant... and discover the secret of nurturing it in this country... there'll be an epidemic... that will turn London into a shambles.
FORSYTHE: We'll take precautions for the protection of London.
FORSYTHE: There is a wolf wandering about, but not the supernatural one.
FORSYTHE: That, I think, disposes of our murders.
But that wolf escaped last night.
That wolf will be captured.
But the murder in Goose Lane was two nights ago.
Do not worry about the animal from the zoo.
Whether you catch it or not, will not matter much... tonight.
Why, sir, you give me quite a start, sir.
That one bud, sir, it seems rather stubborn.
It doesn't seem to want to come out, does it, sir?
I'm afraid it's no use, Hawkins.
It will only need another night.
[Tense instrumental music]
Another night?
Why, sir... you look as if it was a matter of life and death, sir.
Perhaps we can speed it up, sir.
At least we can try, can't we?
- You never fail me, do you, Hawkins?
- No, sir.
Listen. I haven't been here.
- You haven't seen me.
- Why, of course not, sir.
I've got to get away. Immediately.
I can't stay here.
I can't stay here with this stubborn Mariphasa.
Why, Mr. Glendon, whatever brings you here?
- I'm spending the night here.
- I am glad, sir.
And my wife will be happy to cook one more supper for you, sir.
I don't want anyone to know that
I'm here. Not even Mrs. Timothy.
I want to be alone. I want to get away from Glendon Manor... away from my work, away from people.
I want to be alone and think.
You've often wanted to be alone and think, haven't you, Timothy?
Yes, sir, but Mrs. Timothy will be awful disappointed, sir.
You know, she's always talking about the old days... when Miss Lisa's mother and father was alive... and you would come courting here.
WILFRED: Hello, old fellow.
You remember me, don't you?
He seems glad to see me, Timothy.
Yes. Beans remembers the old days, too, sir.
Do you know where I'm going to spend the night?
I was thinking of airing out the best room in the west wing, sir.
No, don't do that.
I'm going to the Monk's Rest.
You can't do that, sir.
Why, it ain't been open for years.
Nevertheless, that's where I'm going to spend the night.
You see, Miss Lisa and I, we miss the old times, too.
Thank you, Timothy.
Why, there ain't even a bed, sir.
I shan't need a bed, Timothy.
- You'll be cold, I'm afraid, sir.
- Lf I am, I shall build a fire.
Here's the key, sir.
- Lock me in, Timothy.
- Pardon, sir?
Lock me in. Don't open that door before sunrise.
Even if I call, pay no attention to it.
Keep that door locked till dawn.
Good night.
Good night, sir.
There it is, Paul. You can just see it through the trees.
Dear old Falden.
I couldn't go back to America without one look at it.
Let's get out of the car here and walk.
All right.
PAUL: Lee, I can't tell you how strange it seems coming back here... after all these years.
This is where we used to hunt for birds' eggs. Remember?
And this is where I proposed to you.
Do you remember that?
And then a bumblebee stung you.
How funny you looked.
My dear, I can't tell you how good it is to hear you laugh again.
Lee, I love you so much.
Always have, always will.
Don't say that, Paul.
You promised you wouldn't.
We've been through it all before. It's no use.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Tense instrumental music]
But you're horribly, miserably unhappy.
Anyone can see that.
It's you who are making me unhappy, Paul.
Couldn't you care for me again?
I wouldn't tell you if I could.
[Tense instrumental music continues]
I don't know why, Lee... but I'm frightened for you.
Terribly frightened.
Don't be silly.
I can still beat you to the Monk's Tower.
It's on. I'll give you a 10-yard start. Off you go.
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[Lntense instrumental music]
LISA: I've won!
[Lisa continues screaming]
[Tense instrumental music]
So you've seen this monster before?
Yes. There was something grotesquely familiar about it.
Then it suddenly struck me.
It was Wilfred Glendon.
FORSYTHE: Paul, pull yourself together.
Do you realise what you're accusing Glendon of?
FORSYTHE: A man I've known all his life.
I repeat, sir. I fought with Wilfred Glendon, a werewolf.
FORSYTHE: Where is Mrs. Glendon now?
At home, doors and windows locked.
Miss Coombes is with her.
They promised not to leave the room until I got back.
Very well. I'll go to Glendon Manor in my official capacity.
But I'm going to form my own conclusions...
- from what I see and hear.
- All right.
We've just found another victim of this monstrous murderer:
A chambermaid at the Bedlington Hotel...
- killed some time last night.
- Very well. I'll be over.
There you are. There's your werewolf for you.
Unless it had seven-league boots... it couldn't get to the Bedlington Hotel...
150 miles from Falden Abbey.
I'll tell you what. We'll go to the hotel... and after that, if necessary, we'll go to Glendon Manor.
I think it'll be necessary.
Usual thing. The place smelled like a kennel when we came in.
You can still notice it.
Who occupied the room?
The guest's name was a Dr. Yogami, sir.
FORSYTHE: The same kind of lacerations?
DETECTIVE: Exactly, sir.
FORSYTHE: Yeah.
Look, sir. I just found these in the wastepaper basket.
I've never seen a flower like it before, have you?
No.
Yogami spoke of some rare plant that Glendon had.
This must be it.
Buck up, my boy. You're not such a fool.
We'll drive down to Glendon Manor at once.
PAUL: Right. I'll get my hat.
Dr. Glendon is not at home, sir.
- Was he here last night?
- I think not, sir.
Have you heard from Dr. Glendon?
No, we haven't heard a word from him.
Has Hawkins seen him?
No. He is not in the laboratory.
- Are you all right, Lisa?
- Yes. Don't worry.
Keep your door locked.
No report from the East End, sir.
No report from Yogami's apartment, sir.
We've heard nothing of Dr. Yogami.
Three men at Glendon's. Yes.
No, we're not afraid.
Glendon has not passed through Richmond.
Headquarters. No station reports any trace of Dr. Glendon.
[Knocking at door]
- Dr. Glendon!
- Quiet. Help me up.
The police have been searching everywhere for you.
I know. The Mariphasa, has it bloomed yet?
No, but it's going to bloom.
That'll be all.
You needn't mention you've seen me.
No, sir. Of course not.
[Soft instrumental music]
Yogami! You brought this on me... that night in Tibet.
I'm sorry I can't share this with you.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Grunting]
[Glass shattering]
Relax, Lisa. Relax.
[Werewolf howling]
Quick. Col. Forsythe.
Col. Forsythe has left for Glendon Manor, madam.
[Police siren wailing]
[Tense instrumental music]
[Glass shattering]
[Car horn honking]
[Siren wailing continues]
[Window pane shattering]
It's Lisa. Don't you know me?
Wilfred!
[Gun shot firing]
Thanks for the bullet.
It was the only way.
In a few moments now...
I shall know why all of this had to be.
Lisa, goodbye.
Goodbye, Lisa.
I'm sorry...
I couldn't have made you happier.
[Sentimental instrumental music]
In my report, I shall say... that I shot him by accident... while he was trying to protect his wife.
[Slow instrumental music]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
Carl Denham.
Mrs. Hudson! Mrs. Hudson!
Get out! I'll have you arrested.
That's my business...
Pretending to be the gas man.
- I'm supposed to...
- The very idea.
All right, Mr. Denham. It's only me.
I am sorry, Mr. Denham. He said he was the gas man. Had a card and everything.
Listen, Mrs. Hudson, as long as I am rooming in your house... if your own father comes to the door, don't you believe a word he says.
It's a pity the people in New York don't try and catch a few gunmen... instead of hunting a nice gentleman like you.
Is Mrs. Hudson there?
Oh, ho. That's the lady in the front room.
- Oh.
- Coming.
I'm from the news.
Is that so? Well, I've got news for you:
You're going to get out of this room so fast...
- No, I'm not.
- Ladies, no riots, please.
If people don't stop getting into my house under false pretenses...
I just want a story.
If I go back without it, I'll lose my job.
- Don't bother to pull that old line.
- You're big news, you know.
What, after a whole month?
That's time enough for New York to forget the World War.
The War was a long way off, but King Kong, the giant ape...
- ...was right here on the spot.
- So I've heard.
And you're the man that brought him here.
Kong is dead. But everybody's interested in you, too, Mr. Denham.
All those people that Kong killed and injured... all the property owners who are suing you for damages, and...
And the theater owners, and the men who put money in advanced publicity, and...
Say, are you telling me?
Why don't you let him alone? He hasn't dared leave the house for a week.
That's what I want, the personal reaction story.
You want to know what the captor of the late Kong...
- ...thinks about, eh?
- Yes.
I thought I had him safe.
Don't you suppose I'm sorry for the harm he did?
I wish I'd left him on his island.
Old Kong, I'm sure paying for what I did to you.
Mrs. Hudson, suppose we look out and count the gentlemen in disguise... who are waiting for me?
If I don't get out of this house pretty soon, I'll choke.
Hey!
Aren't you going to give me a story?
All right, tell my public that Carl Denham, the bright boy... who was going to make a million dollars out of King Kong, is flat broke.
Everybody in New York is suing me for something.
The only place I haven't heard from is the Bide-A-Wee home.
But, Mr. Denham, my readers want to know...
There's a newsboy and a peddler and a taxi driver out there.
I'll bet you a nickel they're all process servers.
- There's a man coming up the steps.
- Huh?
Why, it's Charlie. Let him in.
- Hello, Charlie, what do you want?
- Captain Englehorn send you this.
- Where'd you come from?
- All time, stay on ship.
- Cook for Skipper. Easy job.
- Mm.
Tell the Skipper I'll be over at the ship as soon as I can get out of here.
- What's matter? You scared to come out now?
- You said it. Much obliged, Charlie.
- Maybe you can get out through the basement.
- Come on. Let's try it.
Rags.
Bottles, rags.
You've got a nerve.
I got everything, lady.
And I buy everything.
Rags, bones.
Say, you fresh guy!
Mrs. Hudson.
Mr. Carl Denham.
Well, I'll be. Hello, Mickey.
- Hello.
- Have a heart, will you?
That's 15 of those things you've slipped me.
- I'm the best in the business, Mr. Denham.
- Well, what is it this time?
Steiner and Wayne.
Destruction of property by Kong on 39th street.
Shock, mental anguish, and sprained ankle to owner of said property.
If I don't get out of this house,
I'll bite somebody.
Listen, Mickey, I've got a date.
You've done your job.
How about helping me out-smart those other guys?
Mr. Denham, I'll give you a ride on my junk wagon.
You... Ha, ha. You mean to say you've got a wagon to go with that makeup?
Mr. Denham, I'm an artist.
Hey.
How did you get in there?
You can go from the roof to chimney.
Anthony St. Nick and Santa Claus.
Ooh. Commence.
Rags.
Bottles. Bones.
Rags. Hey, you can take off the tin hat.
You're safe now.
Where are you going, Mr. Denham?
Drop me at the nearest subway station, James.
You know, it's funny how anybody's troubles are somebody's gain.
I've been working steady since you got in this jam.
You've no idea how that cheers me up.
The boy who was going to make a million dollars.
Rags!
So that's the mess I'm in, Skipper.
Kong sure was a hoodoo for me.
I guess next time you leave big monkey alone, huh?
Next time? Ha, ha.
Charlie must think Kongs are plentiful.
Well, Denham, now I'll tell you why I wanted to see you.
- I've got a plan for both of us-
- What is it?
Going to get a couple of megaphones and run sightseeing trips around the harbor?
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Mr. Denham, I...
Mickey.
- One more summons and I'll brain you.
- No, wait, Mr. Denham.
I ain't got no summons. Honest. I ain't.
I come to tip you off.
- Did you follow me over here?
- No, I live over here.
My father-in-law said he saw you come in by the gates.
I feel very friendly to you, Mr. Denham.
You've kept me working pretty steady lately.
Yeah, sure, I know, I've been a big help.
Now, what's on your mind?
I heard this afternoon you're going to be indicted.
- What?
- Indicted.
- The grand jury's going to indict you.
- Let me out of this. I'm going crazy.
You take my tip and get out.
Summons is one thing and grand jury is something else already.
- They are going to put you on the stand.
- Stop it! All right, Mickey, much obliged.
- Now beat it, will you?
- All right. Such a fine customer.
Oh, Denham?
- Denham, I...
- What good is the grand jury?
What can they find out?
I brought Kong back here, he got loose, did a lot of damage... got killed, and that's that.
- What can I do about it?
- We can go to jail for 10 years.
- What do you mean, "we"?
- I'm in it, too, up to my neck.
Now, see here. This ship's still mine.
There are no attachments on her yet.
- They just haven't got around to you.
- That's a good reason for hurrying.
In three hours, I can get together a skeleton crew, enough to handle her.
Yeah, and we'll go yachting.
We can make some sort of a living carrying freight.
Take the East Indies.
There are hundreds of little ports there that no sizable ship ever goes to.
- I know that part of the world.
- What'll we use for money?
Well, I... I've saved up a little.
Enough to get us started.
- Yes, but...
- Come on, Denham.
You know, Skipper... you're pretty swell to be willing to take me with you.
- Is it a go, then?
- What?
To be off on this old ship again, out of all this?
Say, you bet it's a go.
Well, this looks like a hustling community, Skipper.
Suppose we can get any business here?
Better get some soon, or we won't be able to pay the crew.
Say, uh, how far is it to Kong's island?
1,753 miles.
Well, you're pretty glib with that.
You must have been checking up.
Huh? Oh.
I just happened to come across our old chart last night... and I was curious.
Yeah, sure.
- Bosun.
- Yes, sir.
Get that number two hatch off and break out the cargo.
That won't take very long.
If we weren't so short-handed,
I'd get rid of that man.
He's a troublemaker.
Of course, Wong Ho would have to ship his copra last week.
Well, let's see.
There's a couple of half-caste traders here.
We might see them tomorrow...
- ...and get a bit of a cargo.
- Look, Skipper. There's a show in town.
- I'll bet it's terrible.
- Don't be a crab, Skipper. It's a show.
We ought to see it.
- I want a drink and some dinner.
- There's plenty of time for that.
You don't mean to say you're going to miss the sagacious seals?
Don't you want to laugh and thrill with La Belle Helene?
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.
Come, Bobby. Come, George.
Come, Fattima. In with you.
And now, La Belle Helene!
Sweet songstress who has appeared before all the crowned heads of Europe... will conclude the performance... with one of her most popular songs.
La Belle Helene!
Oh, I've got the runaway blues
I want to wander away
Oh, I've got the runaway blues today
Don't want to stay
I know that trains are going somewhere
And steamers are sailing the blue
They go, but baby, what do I care?
'Cause none of them's going to you
Poor kid.
- You know, she's got something.
- It certainly isn't the voice.
Voice, who cares? She's got personality.
Somebody'd show her what to do with it.
I hear the steamer whistle crying
Whoo, whoo
It's just an echo when I'm sighing
Whoo, whoo
You ran away and never told me
What for, what for
And now your arms will never hold me
No more, no more
I don't want the train on the track
Don't want the ship on the sea
Why? 'Cause they ain't bringing you back to me
Poor me
Thank you for your kind reception of our efforts.
And remember, another big show here tomorrow night.
Well, if that's your idea of a pleasant evening, I...
It's interesting, Skipper.
I'll bet you could take a kid like that... and put her over to the producer of a musical comedy.
- But not to the captain of a freighter.
- Ha, ha.
Father, is that man coming again tonight?
Yes, he is. Any objection?
Can't I have a friend drop in?
- He isn't a friend.
- Well, he's a white man...
- ...somebody to talk to.
- Somebody to drink with.
That's enough. Shut up now and go to bed.
You can't get away from here. No money.
How you think you can get away from here? Huh?
Your Dutchman will be here in a couple of days, won't he?
Dutch magistrate? Ha!
What do you think he'll do for you?
He don't care what happens to you and your rotten little show.
Not a rotten show.
I was ringmaster in the biggest circus.
Used to play Colombo, Singapore.
Sure, and you was rotten.
Who're you calling... Who are you?
- Rotten captain!
- You lay off me.
Rotten captain, lost ship.
Lost it on purpose, eh?
Tried to get the insurance...
- ...didn't you?
- Shut up.
Poor captain.
Lost ship, lost job.
Lost certificate.
Ah, dry up, you old tramp.
You're a tramp.
No certificate, no job.
You're no better than me.
And you just lay off my liquor, will you?
Give it back.
Father! Father!
Father!
Father, Father, tell me what happened.
Who did it?
Tony.
Tony, come down.
Tony.
Tony, please, come down.
Tony.
Tony.
- Tony.
- You'll never catch a monkey that way.
- Did you ever catch a monkey?
- Did I ever...? Ha, ha.
Lady, you'd be surprised.
They won't come back.
Oh, well, why should they?
Oh, uh...
I saw your show last night.
How'd the monkeys get away?
I had to let them out.
The tent burned.
Where's the man who owns the show?
He's my father.
He was hurt.
He's dead.
Well, what a tough break.
I'm sorry, kid.
My father used to be with World Wide.
- That's the biggest circus in the East.
- Yes, I know. What did you do?
I was in the ballet.
I wasn't very good.
What happened to World Wide?
Well, my father... Well, he sort of drank.
You know.
And...
They didn't want him anymore.
- So he started his own show.
- Yes.
Well, we just had a few monkeys.
It wasn't very good.
Say, that's no way to talk.
"I wasn't very good, the show wasn't very good."
Cut it out! You want to tell everybody how good you are.
Throw out your chest. Brag about yourself.
Oh.
So you're in the show business too.
No, I'm in the shipping business.
- I just put in with the cargo.
- Oh.
I thought maybe you had a show, and I could...
No, I'm sorry.
Well, I've got a date.
Are you going to be all right?
I mean, have you got any money?
Yes.
Well, keep your chin up.
I'll be seeing you.
Miss, I heard about your father.
- If I could do anything...
- You've done enough.
You killed my father.
Killed? Why, what...?
The tent caught fire.
My father was beaten over the head.
He wasn't burned.
What do you think the magistrate will say to that when he gets here?
You can't accuse me.
- You wasn't there.
- How do you know I wasn't?
Unless you were.
How do you know what my father said to me before he...?
Before he died?
He... What did he say?
The magistrate will be here in a few days.
I'll tell him.
You better be careful.
What are you going to tell the magistrate?
You can just wonder about that till he gets here.
- There isn't a pound of cargo for us here.
- What'll we do now?
Might pick up some business in the Banda group.
It's a dull life, Skipper.
We need excitement.
Carl Denham.
Don't you remember me?
- Nils Helstrom.
- Well, for the love of Mike. Helstrom.
Sure, I remember you.
This is Captain Englehorn.
Captain Helstrom. Sit down.
Say, do you know who this is?
The man who gave me the map of Kong's island.
And he wants to know if I remember him. Ha-ha-ha!
Have a drink.
So, that was your ship came in last night?
Mine and Denham's.
I heard about you in Singapore.
How you'd captured the biggest animal on earth and taken him back to New York.
Agh.
I'm down, Denham.
- Don't you think you owe me something?
- Ha, ha.
Well, sir, you certainly came to the right man.
- How about a 50-50 split?
- You mean that?
Sure, I mean it. I'll give you half of everything I made out of King Kong.
- How much would that come to?
- Well, let's see, 10... no, 11 lawsuits and the privilege of being indicted by the grand jury too.
- Ah. Then you're broke too?
- Broke? I'm shattered.
Well, then how about giving me passage on your ship?
- I want to get away from here.
- Where's your own ship?
I lost her on the Banka reefs.
- Tough luck. No job since?
- Everyone is down on me.
It wasn't my fault.
You know what those waters are like.
Will you take me to some port that isn't Dutch?
- What's the matter with the Dutch?
- I tell you, they're down on me.
I want to make a fresh start.
You realize how far we'd have to go to land you out of Dutch, uh... jurisdiction?
We can't run all over the Indian Ocean carrying one passenger.
Sorry, old man. Have another drink.
But, Denham, when you got Kong off that island... didn't you get the treasure?
- What?
- Didn't you find the treasure?
Find it?
Why, I never even heard of it.
- Say, are you kidding me?
- Why should I?
To tell the truth, I had an idea
I'd go and look for it myself someday.
You held out on me, eh?
How much do you know about this treasure?
Well, not a lot.
Dying native I picked up at sea...
You drew the map from his description, and he told you about the great wall.
Yeah, he talked about the treasure of the island.
Who put it there?
Why, the people who built the wall.
Yes, that might be.
Skipper, do you remember I said there wasn't a reason... on Earth for going back?
Look. The answer to a prayer.
We're off again.
Hello. I heard you were stopping here.
Felt a little worried about you.
Thought I'd better see you before I go.
- Are you going?
- Yes. Off tonight in a big rush.
- On your ship?
- Yeah, sure.
There isn't any other way to get out of this place, is there?
Oh, uh, here, you take this.
- Can't I go too?
- What?
- Let me go on your ship.
- Nix, kid, nix.
We're going on a long voyage.
We won't be putting in at any port where we could leave you.
Don't leave me. Please, take me with you.
I won't be any trouble.
I'll just sit on the ship.
I won't talk or anything.
Listen, kid, I can't. Honest.
Now, you take this money and buy yourself a passage on the next ship... that's going where you want to go.
- Go on, take it.
- Let me go with you.
Please. Please.
No, no, no, nothing doing.
Now, you take it. Sorry it isn't more, but that's the best I can do.
There'll be a schooner or something along pretty soon.
I can't take you, kid. You'll be okay.
You just make a plan and stick to it.
- All right.
- That's a good girl.
It's a pretty tough life, isn't it?
Well...
Good luck.
- Weather's made-to-order, Skipper.
- I hope it holds.
The next land we sight will be Kong's island.
Yeah.
That fellow Helstrom is getting too chummy with the crew.
- I don't like it.
- Why don't you call him down for it?
What's your opinion of Helstrom?
Well, he got in some trouble over losing his ship, I guess.
That's pretty plain.
He certainly was anxious to leave Dakang.
And he isn't at all anxious to get to Kong's island.
Have you noticed him when we talked about the time we were there?
- Think he's scared?
- Scared green.
Green now and yellow later on, eh?
- Does he expect us to go ashore?
- Why, sure.
He's got to have a bodyguard, hasn't he?
Say... do you know there was a dozen sailors killed on the last voyage he made here?
- Killed? By them animals?
- Yeah.
But, you see, Denham and the skipper came out all right.
But you don't have to worry.
There's plenty of rifles aboard.
If I was captain, I certainly wouldn't take my crew into danger.
- Hey!
- What?
Wha...?
Hey, Bill.
Where?
Hey, Connelly.
If you want me to, I'll give Helstrom a tip that he's too thick with the crew.
Go ahead. Bad for discipline.
We must be in Russia. Here comes the Committee of the Workers.
- Captain Englehorn.
- Well?
- Captain, I went down in forward hold.
- Well, what of it?
- Captain, I found something.
- What's the matter? Found what?
Holy mackerel.
- I just didn't have anywhere to go.
- All right, go back to your work.
This young lady a friend of yours,
Mr. Denham?
No. Well... yes. I met her, that is,
I talked with her in Dakang.
Look here, this isn't my fault.
I told her she couldn't come.
Well...
We can't take her back. Mr. Helstrom.
You ought to be beaten to a pulp.
You called me?
Yes, we have a passenger, and she...
You. How did you get here?
This is our partner.
I know him.
You do?
Yes, of course, you couldn't help seeing each other in Dakang, could you?
Well, here we are.
Just one big, happy family.
You take the words right out of my mouth.
You keep your mouth shut.
You promise me to keep quiet.
I won't promise.
You crazy brat. Denham's sore at you anyway for being here.
You try to make trouble between us, and he'll be off you for life.
Skipper's looking for you.
Say, I don't know what's the matter with you and Helstrom... but we're all cooped up together on this ship.
I didn't ask you to come.
You're here on your own hook.
No matter who you like or dislike... you've got to behave and be pleasant.
Understand?
Are you mad at me?
Not very.
It's, uh... This is nice, isn't it?
It's all right.
Mr. Denham.
- Mr. Denham.
- Yeah?
Skipper says get dressed and come on deck.
Okay. What is it?
Have we sighted the island?
Yes, sir, about two miles off.
- Say, it's a thrill coming back here.
- Yes, sir.
You had a pretty bad time when you were here before, didn't you?
Yeah, it's a pretty tough spot.
The natives will be glad to see us.
We did them a good turn once, and I...
What the...?
I'm warning you all.
You're crazy to do a thing like this.
We're not crazy enough to go to that island.
- What is it, Skipper? Is this on the level?
- It's real enough.
- Where's Helstrom? They get him too?
- All right.
Over that side to the lifeboat.
All of you.
So this is why you've been spending so much time in the foxhole.
- What do you think you're doing?
- We know what we're doing.
Come on, get over the side.
You can row yourselves to your blasted island and stay there.
Yes, and if those animals kill anybody, it won't be us.
Yes. Get going.
Because you pay us your dirty money, you think you own us.
You sweat and drive us, but you don't give us a living wage for our blood and sweat.
- When did you do all this sweating?
- You think you own us, body and soul.
- Oh, listen to reason.
- We've listened enough.
We've got the ship and we're going to keep it.
- Over the side.
- You're not going to shove this kid off too.
She followed you aboard the ship, she can follow you off.
Do you think I want to stay? I know.
Here's your chance to get rid of me.
- He killed my father.
- What?
He was a drunken old tramp.
I didn't kill him.
I know you did.
He said you'd be angry if I tried to make trouble.
Well, what a fine partner you've turned out to be.
Aw, pipe down. Get going.
Of course, you know what this will mean when you get caught.
Listen, I'll call the whole thing off now.
We'll turn back.
Sure, and be arrested for mutiny as soon as we reach port.
I'll give you my word I won't report you.
It's too late for that kind of talk.
We'll stick by what we've done.
Over the side and see how you like it.
I'll be seeing you again, I hope.
What do you think the chances are?
- Charlie, they throw you off too?
- No throw off. Get off.
Me no like them men.
- Cast off.
- Wait.
Aren't you going to give us any guns?
We've given you food and water.
You're lucky to get that.
A smart man like you don't need a gun.
Good boy, Charlie.
You cook now, you die pretty soon.
Row, you blasted bourgeois.
You got a nice day for it.
Now, then, go to your places.
Stokers below.
Bosun.
- Get that ladder up.
- What was that?
I said, get the ladder up.
Oh! And I promote you.
- You'll be mate now.
- That's fine. Who's gonna be captain?
I'm taking command, of course.
Clear the decks. Get back to work.
Do you think that we got rid of a good captain... so we could have a bad one?
We're through with captains on this ship.
He wants to be boss.
Let him go with the rest of the bosses.
Yo-ho!
Ha!
That's where all captains belong, over the side.
Bon voygee, Captain Helstrom.
Something tells me we've got a passenger.
Well...
How nice to see you again, under the circumstances.
Skipper, have we got to save him?
Hey, Skipper, when the natives see us,
I bet they'll throw a party.
Well, maybe not a party.
It's the chief.
Hey, did you throw that, you rat?
He says yes, he did, because his village is destroyed... and his people are killed, and it's all our fault for leading Kong inside the wall.
Well, tell him not to attack us.
Tell him we overcame Kong... and we're still big mates.
Come on, Charlie, shove off.
We've got to find another place to land.
What's the good of this?
There's no way out.
Well, it's the only place we've seen where we could get a foot ashore.
Maybe we can climb up someplace.
You stick with me, kid.
A fly couldn't climb out of here.
Yeah, here's a way out.
Wait till I take a look.
- Uh, captain, I...
- Huh?
- About that mutiny, I...
- The less said, the better, Helstrom.
We're all in a tight place together, and I don't think you'll let us down.
No, no, of course not.
Of course not.
- I didn't know that you came.
- You said stick to you.
Do you obey orders?
Why doesn't Denham come back?
We'd better go look for him.
A smart man like you don't need a gun.
Ha!
Look!
Well, if it isn't the little Kong.
He's stuck in the quicksand.
He can't get out.
I never knew that old Kong had a son.
Don't you think we ought to help him?
Well, how?
If we could get logs and things to him, maybe he could get out.
- Aren't you afraid of him?
- Yes, sort of.
Well...
It sounds kind of silly, but I'm sorry for him.
So am I. But I've got a reason.
Animals always know when you're trying to help them.
I don't believe he'd hurt us if he got out.
I suppose we're both crazy, but let's try.
Look out, Skipper, that's quicksand.
Skipper, there's a...
Skipper, believe it or not, there's a little Kong.
What? A little...
- How little?
- Well, just a little one.
- About 12 feet high.
- Good...
Well, what happened? What did you do?
I know it sounds funny, but instead of shooting him, I helped him out of a jam.
I felt...
Well...
I felt I owed his family something.
You really feel conscience-stricken about King Kong, don't you?
Whatever you do, don't mention Little Kong to Helstrom.
- He'd have a nervous breakdown.
- I'd like to break his neck.
We ought to go hunting and save our rations for emergencies.
This is cut right into the side of Skull Mountain.
My guess, that temple.
- Maybe big devil live in there.
- A temple?
Helstrom, suppose the treasure should be hidden here.
That certainly would be wonderful.
- You'd better come along with me, Helstrom.
- We'll meet here at sundown.
My go with Skipper.
Unh!
I'd forgotten you.
You'd better wait right here.
We'll all be back soon.
Do you think I'm going to stay here alone?
Well, all right, then, come on with me.
But be quiet.
And don't talk.
I thought tropical jungles were full of fruit.
That's what everybody thinks who's never been...
Look.
Well, we won't starve, anyway.
Good boy, Little Kong.
Say, can he scrap, just like his old man.
- Look, he's hurt.
- Huh?
Poor Little Kong.
Do you suppose he knew he was helping us?
Of course not.
You want me to believe he was grateful?
Well, he did save us, didn't he?
And how do we know what animals think?
Let's go and help him.
Are you game?
Yes, if you are.
Wait.
If you talk, very calmly... sometimes that keeps animals quiet.
- You frightened him.
- Yeah, that's too bad.
Was I too rough with him?
Poor old boy.
Baby Kong.
Yeah, some baby.
You're not a patch on your old man.
I must be completely cuckoo to be doing this.
Giving you a ﬁrst-aid treatment instead of running like blazes.
Guess it must be remorse or something.
You see...
I'm the guy that knocked out your pop with a gas bomb and then... carried him off to New York in chains.
I've been sorry for it ever since.
Yeah, you see, the poor old geezer got shot at the finish.
I guess if I'd left him alone... we'd all have been better off.
This is sort of an apology.
There you are, boy.
Two good deeds in one day for something that size... we ought to be caught up on our good deeds for a year.
I wish I had one of those coconuts.
I'll see what I can do about it.
Hey, look what you're doing, you big dummy.
I wish you'd be a little more careful of what you wish for.
Hey.
You better lie down and do your sleeping.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to go to sleep.
I was helping you keep watch.
I have to keep watch of you.
That's the third time I've caught you.
Aren't you going to signal the others again?
Well, there's no use wasting any more ammunition.
They'd have answered those shots
I ﬁred if they'd heard them.
You better lie down.
Here.
Take my coat for a pillow.
- You'll need it.
- No, I won't. I'll keep the fire going.
There you are.
You're a grand little scout.
I'm sorry I got you into all this mess, kid.
You didn't.
I came.
Well, then I'm glad they wouldn't let you stay on the ship.
But I'm just another trouble.
You told me not to come on the boat.
- Good night, kid.
- Good night.
It's gone.
What fashion animal you call that, huh? I no like.
Here's your gun.
Well, that leaves only one shotgun among us.
It's light enough now.
We better go and look for Denham and the girl.
Mm. Heh.
- Well.
- Good morning.
Good morning.
- No sign of the Skipper?
- No.
I'll fire one more shot.
Our guardian angel.
Hey, look.
I'm going to try and get into this place.
If you have no objections.
You're sure you don't mind?
Well, that's fine.
Listen, you attend to your business and I'll attend to mine.
Look! The treasure!
The treasure of the island!
I was expecting you.
Come on, baby.
We've found it!
Please, Little Kong, help us.
Hand it down.
Attaboy, Kong.
Stick to me, kid, and you'll wear diamonds.
Look at them.
Just look at them. We're rich.
We're all rich.
Well, what are you going to do with them?
Huh?
Yeah, I guess maybe a sailboat would be more useful.
Hey, put that down.
Hey, look out!
You'll shoot yourself, you half-wit.
Hey!
Hey, look out! You want to kill somebody?
Sure, you've fixed everything now.
You big rummy.
Do you think he's dead?
Denham.
That's the Skipper.
- What's happened? Where's your gun?
- It's broken, Skipper, but listen...
What? Both guns gone? We can't stay here. Let's go back to the boat.
Helstrom, the treasure, I...
You fool, there never was any treasure.
Let's go, let's get out of here.
Then that was just a yarn you were giving me.
Of course. I had to tell you that to get away from Dakang.
Then there isn't any treasure at all?
Helstrom. Helstrom.
- He's going to the boat.
- Why, that crazy fool may take it.
Let's go after him.
I'm going back for the rest of the treasure.
Make sure of the boat.
I'll catch up with you. Hurry!
Earthquake!
My poor kid.
It doesn't seem to matter very much.
Stick to me and you'll wear diamonds.
Look.
Look.
Ship.
Ship.
Hello, kid.
What are you thinking about?
Poor Little Kong.
Do you suppose he knew he was saving my life?
Well, I'm sure he did.
Pretty soon, when we get back... you'll be saying goodbye to me, won't you?
Yeah.
What?
Where are you going?
I don't know.
Well, you'll have plenty of money, kid.
We'll split the treasure four ways.
Couldn't you just split it... three ways?
How do you mean?
Well... one-third to the Skipper, one-third to Charlie... and one-third... to us.
Well, you said stick to you.
This is nice, isn't it?
It's all right.
- No, I won't. Let's get out of here.
- There's nothing to be afraid of.
When I go out to a play,
I want to have some fun.
You bring me to a place like this where they make you scream and faint.
But it's a fillip to jaded nerves.
It's a new shudder.
Well, if that's the kind of a man you are, you can take me home.
Now, wait a minute, darling.
You've got it all wrong.
Flowers again.
- A gentleman of the old school, Marie.
- Old or new, they all try the same things.
"Tonight I'm sad. For no longer will
I be able to watch you every evening
"from my Ionely, shadowed box."
And no signature.
A man can't take the same box every night for 47 nights without the whole theatre knowing who he is.
Gogol. Nasty, foreign-sounding name.
That was very mean of you.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Making fun of a famous man like Dr. Gogol.
Well, if he's so famous, what's he doing hanging around here all the time?
Why, Marie, my public.
No, he really is a great surgeon.
He cures deformed children and mutilated soldiers.
Soldiers? I wish he'd fix one up for me.
Your usual box, Professor?
- Will you do me a favor?
- Of course.
Call Dr. Wong at my clinic and tell him
I'll be there before midnight, will you?
Most happy, Doctor.
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
I've been meeting you in dreams all my life, standing just like that.
You know me.
Raoul, your own little cabbage?
Take your hands off.
Why didn't you warn me, my dear?
My card, monsieur.
I'm perfectly willing to give you satisfaction.
Don't be a fool.
And don't you be jealous, my friend.
She's not for either of us. She's only wax.
Good evening, Doctor.
What time is it?
Just on the hour.
What number is the station?
Madame, I only told you four times tonight, 12.50.
After I was married a year,
I remembered things like radio stations and forgot my husband.
Continuing our concert
from Fontainebleau,
we shall now hear one of the most
brilliant younger English pianists,
an artist with a great future.
How about mentioning that he's married to an artist with a great future?
Louder, Marie, he didn't hear you.
- Curtain call, madame.
- Oh, yes, yes
... here, tonight, for the first time
on any concert stage,
an original composition ofMonsieur Orlac.
Hurry, please, please, hurry.
His enviable reputation for purity of tone
and brilliance of technique.
Monsieur Orlac is now on the platform.
- Curtain call, Yvonne.
- Oh, yes, Charles.
You listen, Marie. You know the signal.
If he coughs twice, it means "I love you."
Sir, how dare you threaten your Duchess with torture?
- The Duke.
- You see my warrant.
You only have one question to answer.
Who was the man who escaped from your balcony in the palace?
No!
Don't! No!
How you must love him.
Nicolo, you're my husband.
You loved me once.
His name?
Yes, he was there. Yes, I do love him.
But do you think I'd betray him to your vengeance? Never!
- How very unpleasant. Bring the irons.
- No!
Yes, yes, it was your brother!
- Did he cough?
- Certainly.
- How many times?
- Six, eight, ten times. I lost count.
Maybe he has a cold.
If he doesn't cough, he doesn't love you.
If he coughs too much, he has a cold.
What a system.
From now on, we won't need any more systems.
Maybe we'll miss all this.
Curtain calls, grease paint, an audience.
Stephen will be my audience.
It's a waste, one person.
No, no, not waste, Marie. Happiness.
Marie, come on, we need help at the party.
You go, I can dress myself.
And don't get too near the punch bowl.
Monsieur Orlac's last number will be
the G Minor Ballade by Chopin.
And I love you, darling.
Madame Yvonne, would it be possible?
Come in.
Oh, it's you, Dr. Gogol.
- You know me?
- We all know you.
You've kept the theatre running by buying that box every night.
Won't you come in?
Thank you so much for all the lovely flowers.
Every night I have watched you and tonight, the last night,
I felt I must come and thank you
- for what you have meant to me.
- I'm very flattered, Doctor.
And when the theatre reopens,
I shall be in my box again.
- Every night.
- I do hope so, for the theatre's sake.
- I won't be here, I'm afraid.
- You are playing somewhere else?
Never again.
- Never again?
- No.
I'm going to England with my husband.
Your...
Your husband?
Yes, that's he playing now from Fontainebleau. Stephen Orlac.
I'm meeting his train tonight.
- Stephen Orlac.
- How do you think he plays?
That's his own composition, you know.
Very modern music.
We've been married a year, but he's been on tour and I've been busy with the theatre.
So you see, this is really going to be our honeymoon.
You know, I've come to depend on seeing you every night.
But I'm going to England.
But I must see you again. I must.
Yvonne, we're all waiting. Hurry.
Dr. Gogol, why not join our party?
You represent our public. Come on.
Oh! Lovely!
A wedding cake for the bride who's been married a year.
Who hasn't been on her honeymoon yet.
What am I bid for the first slice?
- A kiss for the bride.
- Sold.
I want to kiss the bride, too.
The line forms on the right.
One kiss, one piece of cake for each.
- I'm next.
- Me, too.
What... Doctor.
- No champagne, no cake, and no kiss?
- No, thank you.
Come along. Yvonne. Yvonne.
Yvonne. Yvonne, don't forget our public.
- Dr. Gogol.
- Dr. Gogol.
That's a good one.
- I wish I had one like that.
- You would, eh?
- Who's next?
- I'm next.
- No, I...
- No, I am next.
How about me? How about me?
Where are you taking that figure?
- To the melting pot.
- Melting pot?
Yes, 50 francs of wax in that thing.
And no doubt you'd take 75 for it.
Would you?
What's the idea?
- Did you ever hear of Galatea?
- Galla who?
- Not wanting a statue of him, are you?
- I don't want a statue of Galatea.
You see, she was a statue herself.
Pygmalion formed her, out of marble, not wax.
And then, she came to life in his arms.
Start the motor, Henry.
There's queer people on the streets of Montmartre at this time of night.
Here, 100 francs, if you'll deliver the statue to my house.
It's a go, Dr. Gogol.
First thing in the morning.
You see, monsieur, 20 francs extra for the dog in the van.
Of course, monsieur, the guard.
You will keep my confidence?
Well, if my silence is worth 20 francs to you, buy it.
I'm hungry.
- Who is that man?
- Rollo, the murderer.
Rollo. You read the case, monsieur?
The American threw knives in a circus.
Stuck one in his father's back because of a woman.
He was convicted last week.
His autograph.
I have here autographs of a hundred famous persons and not a single murderer.
May I use your pen, monsieur? Thank you.
- Pardon me.
- Come on in, fat boy.
- Monsieur Rollo?
- Yeah.
- Don't you stick your nose in here.
- Yes. You might get it pinched.
Give a guy a break.
You boys won't gab with me.
- I followed your case in the papers.
- Yeah? For once I got top billing.
Boy, I bet it burned those guys in the circus.
How did you happen to become such a great expert at knife-throwing?
Practice. Learned to toss a penknife when I was six.
Run away with the circus at 10, and made my living with a knife.
- May I have your autograph?
- Sure. Give me.
Say, you can't talk about her like that.
I loved that dame, even if she did two-time me.
The pen.
Well, old hands can still do their stuff, eh?
What do you want here?
- Well, this happens to be my pen.
- Well, take it and get out.
- What about that call for Dr. Gogol?
- They're still trying to get him.
Here's the American journalist you sent for.
Hiya, kid.
- Hello, Chief.
- Monsieur Reagan.
You are the gentleman who's going to cover this execution?
Yeah. I wish they'd cover it so I can't see it.
You know, I got a weak stomach.
This Rollo is an American.
Yes. That's why it will make a good story for our paper.
The fact is, we are anxious to avoid undue sensationalism
- in the American papers.
- I know what you mean.
- I'll use a soft pencil.
- Thank you.
And if, as you say, your nerves are a little weak,
- I suggest you bring a flask of cognac.
- No. Gin, Chief.
Gin for executions, beer for birthdays, wine for weddings and champagne.
- Oh, champagne.
- For what?
You ask that and you're a Frenchman?
Dr. Gogol's clinic on the wire.
Her first natural sleep in weeks.
Poor little thing.
Tomorrow you can take the boards out from under her.
- Telephone for you, Professor.
- Don't disturb me now.
- The brace will give sufficient support.
- Yes, Professor.
But, it's the Prefect of Police himself.
He insists.
Yes, Monsieur Rosset?
Yes.
Rollo?
Tomorrow at 6:00?
Of course, I'll be there. Thank you.
Is that Dr. Gogol, the famous surgeon?
- You're very inquisitive.
- Well, that's my job to be inquisitive.
I wonder if I could get him to write some articles for our newspaper.
You'll see him at the guillotine.
Why not ask him?
Good idea.
Rollo's train gets in from Fontainebleau in 20 minutes.
Like to come to the station with me?
Why, certainly. A welcome committee and a farewell party rolled into one.
Hey, Chief, let's get out of here.
This thing's a Turkish bath.
Can you please tell me when the Fontainebleau Express will arrive?
Go ahead and tell her, Chief.
No one seems to know, madame.
It's 20 minutes late already.
Hey, Chief, look.
What's the matter?
Has this whole town gone crazy?
Wrecked! Number 18 is wrecked!
What train is wrecked?
Sorry, madame,
I can't give any information.
Then give it to me.
Fontainebleau Express,
Monsieur le Prefect.
- Is it serious?
- I don't know, madame.
- Where was it?
- Near Geron, 20 miles out.
Relief train leaving on Track 9.
- Please.
- Can I see you a minute?
Please. Please, may I go with the relief train?
- Sorry, madam, it's against orders.
- Come on, we'll get a taxi.
All right, fellows. Come on, everybody.
Stephen!
Help me, please. Please help me.
Help me somebody! Please, here.
- Well, Doctor?
- Your husband will live.
Madame, what joy.
The head injury is not serious.
It's only his hands.
- Only his hands?
- I'm afraid we shall have to amputate.
Amputate! No, no!
No, Doctor, you don't understand!
His hands... He's a great pianist!
But even so, madame, what are hands when it's a matter of saving life?
- But his hands are his life!
- Excuse me.
- Madame, Dr. Gogol.
- Oh, no, not that man.
But he's a genius, madame, and if it means Monsieur Stephen's life?
Yes. Yes.
Doctor... Doctor, can you get an ambulance to take my husband to Paris
- to Dr. Gogol's house immediately?
- But, madame...
I know the risk. I'll take the responsibility.
Dr. Marbeau, there are two operations waiting.
As you wish, madame.
It's great to start the day off.
Oh, all right. All right.
I'm coming. I'm coming.
Ring your head off. All right. There.
Hello? Hello?
Yes, this is the Professor Gogol's housekeeper.
Yes.
Well, the Professor isn't here.
If you want to know, he's visiting Madame Guillotine.
He never misses one of those head choppings.
Attention!
Present arms!
Attention!
Say, Chief, I barely made this.
You know, they had me in the jug.
They said I insulted one of those gendarmes at the wreck.
- Quiet, Monsieur Reagan, if you please.
- Okay.
Boy. Ain't that something.
He's an American, ain't he?
Can I ask him a question?
- Hiya, buddy.
- Hiya, partner.
- Tough luck, kid.
- We all get it in the neck some day.
- Say, tell me something, will you?
- Anything you want to know.
Well, I'm from Las Vegas and I hear they finished the big dam.
Biggest in the world, and it's making a lake 200 miles long.
It's the gospel truth, kid.
Well, what do you think of that?
So long. Come on.
Not ill, my friend, are you?
Oh, Doc, on the level
I'm as sick as a bedbug.
Come here a minute.
Say, how'd you like to make a couple of bucks by writing some articles for the magazine section of our paper
- back in New York?
- Why buy articles about me?
You can get all you want from the medical journals.
Wait a minute.
Who reads the medical journals?
The stuff I want is the stuff you do you don't put in the journals.
Are you catching on?
And I'm not interested in your publicity, young man.
Well, Doc, you want to make a couple of dollars, don't you?
Chief, will you talk... Ain't that murder.
Suzanne.
- Yes, Professor?
- Why that ambulance?
I ordered no case here for experiment.
They brought a man whose hands were smashed in the Fontainebleau wreck.
What man? What wreck?
How dare you let people turn my clinic into a public hospital?
But, Professor, his wife brought him, a Madam Orlac.
- What?
- She said you were her friend.
- Where is he?
- In the ward with Dr. Wong.
- Has he come yet?
- Yes. He's with your husband.
Oh, thank heaven.
Prepare for amputation.
Doctor. His hands? Can you save them?
Calm yourself, madame. He's in no danger.
There are other outlets for musical talent besides playing.
He's also a composer.
I understand.
You mean to amputate.
And I believed you could save them.
Believed you would help me.
If it would help,
I'd gladly give my own two hands, but...
All right, then.
Now you must rest and when you awaken, everything will be over.
If I could only help her.
If I could only find a way.
- There must be a...
- Impossible, Professor.
- Impossible?
- Impossible.
Napoleon said that word is not French!
Suzanne! Suzanne!
Call the Prefecture of Police.
Get Prefect Rosset himself.
Emergency call!
Stop the anesthetic.
Stop the anesthetic.
Of course I want to help you, Dr. Gogol, but I've got to get a release.
Don't worry about it.
I'll have Rollo's body at your clinic within 30 minutes.
Good luck with your experiment.
Increase the carbon dioxide.
Congratulations, Professor. You've done it.
Once I felt the blood pulsing through the hands,
I knew the operation would succeed.
- Thank you.
- Good night, Professor.
Good night.
Whatever made him bring you here?
There's never been any woman in this house but me.
And if he must have them here,
I prefer live ones to dead ones.
Francoise.
Yes, Monsieur Professor. Pretty, isn't she?
- Get out.
- Yes, monsieur.
- Hello, there. How are you?
- Well, who are you?
That's no way to talk to a gentleman.
Ain't that a pretty bird?
You know, I got a parrot of my own.
- Well, what do you want?
- I got to see Dr. Gogol.
- It's a very important matter.
- Nobody comes in here.
Come here. Come here, queenie.
Lookie here. Now, there's a 50-franc note.
I'll give it to you if you'll answer me one question.
Now, they brought a stiff in here.
What did he do with it?
Oh, I don't know.
He's upstairs fussing over it now.
There's your answer. Now get out.
What are they doing with the head?
Playing football with it?
The head?
Yes, the head's off.
I saw it come off myself.
Well, the head was on when they carried it in here.
- Are you sure of that?
- I'm sure of it.
Holy jumping catfish!
What's going on in here?
Now, now, you can't come in here!
Do you want me to lose my job?
Come here a second, will you, please?
Galatea.
But I am no Pygmalion.
"The face of all the world is changed,
I think,
"Since first I heard the footsteps of thy soul"
"Guess now who holds thee?
"'Death,' I said
"But, there, the silver answer rang
"'Not death, but love"'
You know, it was wonderful having you to myself all these months.
You're a selfish little thing, aren't you?
Look.
Spring in Paris.
I feel so helpless.
Never mind.
You won't have them much longer.
- They... They feel dead.
- They will for a time.
You see, the muscles are atrophied at present from lack of use.
But they... They don't look like mine.
You forget they were badly crushed.
Alcohol.
No one in the world but you, Doctor, could have performed this miracle.
We can never repay you.
I had to find a way because you trusted me.
- We can't possibly express our gratitude.
- Don't. Please.
Now, try to move your fingers.
There. Splendid.
Well, I began playing the piano with one finger.
I can start that way again.
Of course, there's still much to be done.
You'll need some regular massage, some ultra-violet treatments, graduated exercise.
I'm afraid it will prove a long and expensive business.
You're an angel.
You know we'll pay you just as soon as
Monsieur Stephen is well again.
I understand, madame.
I used to play rather well once, didn't I?
- And you will again, dear.
- No, not with these.
Wonderful invention, the phonograph.
Keeps a man alive long after he's dead.
Please, don't say things like that, darling.
Sometimes I feel that these records
- are all that's left of Stephen Orlac.
- All of Stephen Orlac is left.
His tenderness, his genius, and his arms.
The arms that hold me close to him.
Forgive me, darling, for thinking so much of myself.
More practice, that's the answer.
Yes, that's it. More practice.
Well, but if it weren't for these money troubles...
I know what you're doing.
Selling everything.
Even your rings.
Yvonne, I'm so sorry.
- We'll be all right.
- Yes, of course, we will.
- Stephen.
- Yeah?
I know how proud you are, but why don't you go to your stepfather?
No. No.
I swore I'd never see that man again.
But, darling, this is an emergency, surely.
It wouldn't mean a thing to him.
Have we heard one word from him since my accident? No.
I tell you, darling, it isn't a question of pride...
Then don't go. We'll manage somehow.
You have no right to force your way in here.
The piano is still our property till the loan is paid.
Sorry, madame, he pushed his way past me.
I want my money.
But, monsieur, we really intend to pay you.
I want my money or I'll take the piano.
But you can't take it.
It means everything to my husband.
So, you can't pay, eh?
Very well, I'll return tomorrow with a court order.
This happens to be my pen, gentlemen.
Monsieur Stephen.
Hello, Pierre. Is my father in?
Hello, Father.
Well, the great musician, eh?
- What do you want?
- Can't you forget?
- Can't we be friends?
- And how is the piano-playing?
Well, since my accident,
I haven't been able to play.
- Can we go into the office?
- So that's it.
- You've come here for money.
- I never said so.
But I thought you might have a little understanding, sympathy...
- Sympathy?
- All right, Father. All right.
- I don't want your money.
- That's good.
Because you won't get a franc, not a sou.
For years I've wanted you in business with me.
But being a tradesman wasn't good enough for you.
Now that your hands are smashed up, you can't thump a piano any longer, you come crawling back to me.
And that actress you married.
Why don't you let her help you now?
Her pay may be small, but she could supplement her earnings.
Stop it!
No!
Monsieur! Monsieur!
To be near you like this, is more happiness than I've ever known.
But, Dr. Gogol, quite frankly,
I asked you to come here to talk about Stephen.
And you must tell me the truth.
Will he ever be able to play again?
I mean, as he used to play?
Her thoughts are only for him.
He's my husband and I love him.
Is there no room in your heart, even pity for a man who has never known the love of a woman, but who has worshipped you since the day he first walked by that absurd little theatre?
Dr. Gogol, please.
Well, I can't be silent any longer.
- You're a woman. You must have known...
- Yes.
Yes, I knew of your feeling for me.
I traded on it.
And since you saved Stephen,
I feel deeper friendship for you than for anyone, but...
I can give you nothing else in return.
- Nothing?
- Nothing.
Even if I didn't love him, there's something about you that...
- Repulses you?
- Frightens me.
You are cruel, but only to be kind.
Thank you for trying to understand.
And now see what he's gone and bought you, dearie.
It cost him a whole month of my wages.
But what's that to you.
I hired out as a housekeeper, and what am I now?
Lady's maid to a waxwork.
Now...
And flycatcher for a plant.
Wait a minute now. Just wait a...
Now, here's your dinner.
You'll be dead soon, dearie.
He likes dead things.
Now who can that be?
Now, you stay here, Josephine, go on, till I go and see who it is.
I'll see who that is ringing the bell.
All right, all right. Coming. I'm coming.
It's a woman's place to carry her all the way down.
If I could only get to that bell,
I'd be all right.
That's fine. That's it.
Now I can see all right.
So, it's you again.
Now, how many times am I to send you away?
I've got to see the doctor or
I'll get fired. Listen, queenie...
- Well, you can't see the doctor.
- I got a present for you.
- Napoleon Brandy.
- Cognac?
- I like cognac.
- Well, I like you.
You do like that cognac. I like cognac.
You know, I used to go with a girl like you.
Only, she drank.
Now, tell me, what did he do with it?
You said it had no head.
Well, I looked at the head and there ain't no marks on the neck.
When did you look at the head?
I look at it every day.
He makes me brush its hair every evening.
Brush his hair? Where does he keep it?
Upstairs in his drawing room, just like it was alive.
He sits at his organ and he plays music to it every night.
- He plays music to it every night?
- Every night.
- And you brush his hair?
- Every...
I got to see this.
Sorry, I gotta see the whole thing...
Wait a minute.
You can't go up there. My job...
I'd get into an awful row with the Professor.
You know, I can't do this.
What are you doing?
- Madam Orlac.
- Yeah, but you can't go in there.
- What is she doing in there?
- The Professor...
- Francoise!
- Monsieur Professor.
Hiya, Doc.
I'm sorry to butt in like this, but we newspaper fellas have to barge in places we're not really welcome.
I didn't know there was anything going on between you and Madam Orlac.
- Get out of here.
- I'll go.
I got a business proposition.
I got a proposition to offer you.
$2,000 to write some articles for our paper.
You know, of your experiments.
I want to...
- Get out of here!
- I'll go.
Will I be able to walk after?
Yes, my child.
Then, I'm not afraid.
I have saved 50 francs.
- All I have in the world.
- I do not operate for money.
Thank you, Doctor.
I must see him. I must.
What have you done to me?
- Monsieur Orlac.
- What have you done to me?
- Come in here.
- You and your black magic.
- What's wrong?
- You know very well.
Now, what is it?
I've just come back from Geron.
I've seen Dr. Marbeau.
He told me that my hands were crushed beyond saving and that these aren't mine.
Marbeau? Who is this Marbeau?
- Well, whose hands are these?
- What's wrong with them?
Ten fingers, every nerve, every muscle works perfectly.
What's wrong with them?
They have a life of their own.
They feel for knives.
They want to throw them.
And they know how to.
Watch.
And that's not the worst.
They want to kill.
And today they tried to kill my father.
- With a knife?
- Yes.
Now, my friend, I understand your case.
And I think I can help you.
Well, go on.
Ready for operation, Professor.
First, forget that provincial fool.
I am Gogol, and I tell you those are your hands.
- Yes, but why...
- Don't interrupt.
After the shock of the wreck came a second shock.
Your hands were altered by my knife.
You could no longer play.
As a result, your disturbed mind was ready for any phobia.
But the knives? The wish to kill?
Your case is one of arrested wish fulfillment.
But why should I wish to throw knives?
Perhaps, as a little child, some playmate threw a knife cleverly.
You wished you could do it like him.
Now, that wish was not fulfilled.
It festered deep in your subconscious.
If you could bring that forgotten memory, whatever it is, into consciousness, you would be cured instantly.
Knife.
Knives.
No, I remember nothing.
Marie, has he come home yet?
- I've looked everywhere for him.
- No, madame.
But Dr. Gogol called.
He wants you to come to him at once.
- Dr. Gogol? When?
- Half an hour ago, madame.
Half an hour ago?
You told him the truth?
I told him a lot of nonsense
I don't believe myself.
I didn't dare to tell him his hands are those of a murderer.
That would probably drive him... to commit murder himself.
Madame Orlac to see you, Professor.
Have her come in.
- But the operation, Professor.
- Leave me.
What's happened? Where is he?
I sent him home.
- I think if he follows my advice...
- What advice?
To go away, burrow himself in the country.
It's absolutely necessary for his cure that he go alone.
But, do you mean that I'm not to go with him?
Yes.
Why did you give him that advice?
I did what I could for him.
I've failed.
The shock has affected his mind.
His life is ruined already.
Yvonne, get away from him before he ruins your life as well.
Now I understand.
You don't. How could you?
I, a poor peasant, have conquered science.
Why can't I conquer love?
Don't you understand?
You must be mine. Not his.
You are mine.
Liar. Hypocrite. You disgust me.
Start the anesthetic.
Liar!
Hypocrite!
You disgust me!
They are laughing at you in there. Go back.
They are laughing. Go.
Let them laugh!
Nothing matters to you but one thing.
Yvonne.
Yvonne in your arms.
You can conquer love.
Of course you can.
Think.
You've thought for others,
now think for yourself.
Power of suggestion.
See how easy it is?
Already working.
Splendid.
Splendid.
He's a weakling, anyway.
Do it.
And then she'll be helpless.
She must come to you.
Doctor, thank you!
My little girl will walk again.
You saved her. You saved her.
I'm so happy. Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you.
Extra! Read all about it!
Rich jeweler murdered!
Extra! Read all about it!
Rich jeweler murdered!
Rich jeweler murdered! Extra!
Yes, Monsieur Stephen, he grabbed the knife from the counter.
He threw it at his father.
And then, he ran out.
- Is this the knife?
- Yes.
Take it to Varsac to check for fingerprints.
Tell me, why should Stephen Orlac want to kill his father?
They were arguing about money, monsieur.
There were hot words.
Was it you who telephoned me to come here?
Yes.
You said you'd tell me the truth about my hands.
They throw knives, huh?
How did you know that?
I have no hands.
Yours, they were mine once.
I knew it. He lied.
And so when you knifed your father in the back last night, you killed him with my hands.
I killed my father?
No. No.
I threw a knife at him yesterday, but I...
Last night.
Last night, I...
- No.
- You remember now?
No. Since I left Dr. Gogol,
I can't remember anything.
Pick it up.
Feel the balance.
Use it when they try to arrest you.
Who are you?
I am Rollo.
- The knife thrower.
- No, no.
Rollo died in the guillotine.
Yes, they cut off my head, but that Gogol, he put it back here.
Arrest Stephen Orlac. 151 Avenue Colbert.
Wanted for murder.
Bring to General Headquarters immediately. Repeat.
Stephen.
It wasn't I who did it.
- It was Rollo's hands.
- What is it?
What's the matter, darling?
I've murdered my stepfather.
I've just seen Rollo.
You remember Rollo?
They cut off his head, but Gogol put it back on.
It was Rollo who told me that I did it.
Stephen, my darling. You're not well.
All this is some wild dream.
You're with me now.
Everything will be all right.
So you don't believe that these are Rollo's hands.
All right then. I'll prove it.
They may not be able to play the piano, but you watch how they can throw a knife.
Gogol.
That's what it is.
He's trying to drive you mad.
You can't take him this way!
Pardon, madame. These men insist!
- They say they are from the police!
- The police?
Yes, madame. I'm very sorry.
- Monsieur Stephen Orlac?
- Yes.
In the name of the law, I arrest you for the murder of your father.
Murder? There must be some mistake.
It isn't true.
When did this awful thing happen?
- Last night.
- Stephen.
Tell her how my father was killed.
Stabbed with a knife.
Throwing knives seems to be a hobby of yours.
- No, no, no, please!
- It's no use, darling.
All right, Officer. I'm ready.
If you like, I can put these on downstairs.
Thank you.
Wait! I'll go with you.
- I'm sorry, madame, but...
- There's nothing you can do, darling.
All right, Officer.
No, no, there's some mistake!
He didn't do it! Stephen, tell them!
You can't, you can't do this!
Stephen, my darling! Let me go with you!
Monsieur Rosset, there are no two sets of fingerprints alike in the world.
These two prints are those of the same man.
How can that be, Varsac, when Rollo is dead?
I don't understand you at all.
You must have made a mistake.
There can be no mistake.
Fortunately, our case against
Stephen Orlac doesn't depend on fingerprints.
Here's to you, Josephine.
Come on. You come in and have a party.
That's your perch.
'Cause you say he's a...
...as vain as...
You're a jolly old girl Josephine
Well, I'll tell you, if it's that man again, I'll show him.
I'll show him what it's like getting the doorknob with...
That's it. Now I'll show...
How did you get out?
Go upstairs quickly where you belong, before he comes back and finds you wandering around loose.
Upstairs, I say. Go upstairs.
Get up there because
I've got to see you in there before he comes back. No, no.
Not in that one.
Get into that one. Get in the room.
I'll get all the blame when the Doctor comes and finds you...
But I must see Dr. Gogol.
Nobody answered at the clinic.
It talks! It's come alive.
- Please, I must see him.
- It's come alive!
It's come alive!
Dear, oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear.
It went out for a little walk and then it started to talk.
I'm not going back there.
- Not me. Not me.
- Who went out for a little walk?
The wax statue. It came to life, I tell you.
They often come back to life, and go out for little walks.
- Yes.
- They do?
Now, you come for a little walk with us.
I know a doctor who wants to have a word with you.
Well, I never saw a statue come to life.
That fool.
He believes he murdered his father.
He'll kill now.
Power of suggestion.
How easily it worked.
Triumph, Galatea.
Triumph.
He thinks he murdered his father, when it's I who killed him.
Galatea, she'll come here now, flesh and blood, not wax like you.
And he shall be shut up in the house where they keep the mad.
I, Gogol, will do that.
He shall be shut up when it's I who am mad.
But nobody knows that.
Excepting you and me.
It's our little secret.
And now I shall play to you, for the last time.
No, you don't understand.
These are Rollo's fingers, Rollo's hands.
It was Rollo who told me that I killed him.
My friend, Rollo's head was cut off months ago.
Yes, but Gogol put it back for him.
He took off his hands and put them onto my arms. Look.
The fingerprints on the knife.
The prints of Rollo, and this man's prints, they are all the same.
I got it.
Man without head kills rich jeweler.
What an eight-column spread that'd be on the front page.
Why, that's the greatest story since Lindbergh flew to Paris.
Oh, boy, it was only true.
Let me see those hands of yours.
Say, you were in a bad railroad wreck, is that right?
Chief, I don't like the marks on this guy's hands.
You sent Rollo's body to Dr. Gogol, and I've been trying to find out for months what he did with it.
Never mind about his head, but I believe this hand stuff is true.
- You say you saw Rollo tonight?
- Yes, and he's got his head fixed up in a sort of steel and leather brace.
Rollo's got his head back.
Orlac has got Rollo's hands.
And what has Dr. Gogol got?
If I don't find out, I got no job.
Chief, let me talk to you a minute.
This is private. Come here.
Hey, Chief, that Dr. Gogol is 100% /% crazy.
He tried to strangle me the other night. You know why, don't you?
I found a woman in his house.
Now do you catch on?
- But surely he...
- Now, wait a second, please.
This is important.
You know who the woman is, don't you?
Yvonne, the actress, this guy's wife.
Now do you catch on? It's the old story.
The old family doctor's stuck on a girl and tries to plant a murder on her husband to get rid of him.
He's been doing something mighty queer with Rollo's body.
I begin to think you're right, Monsieur Reagan.
We'll look into this immediately.
Order my car.
Now you're talking.
There's blood on your cheek, Galatea.
So it seems that wax can bleed.
Galatea, I am Pygmalion!
You were wax, but you came to life in my arms.
Dr. Gogol, please!
You speak. You speak to me.
My love has made you live.
Galatea,
- give me your lips.
- Let me go! Let me go!
René, René.
Don't drive so fast, there's no hurry.
Why are you afraid of me?
I love you, I love you.
You came to life for me.
- Don't you know me, Galatea?
- Yes.
Yes, I am Galatea.
But let me go now, please.
I promise to come back.
- You are lying. You wouldn't come back.
- No.
- You hate me. You despise me.
- No. No.
Liar! Hypocrite! You disgust me!
But I love you!
Each man kills the thing he loves.
Each man kills the thing he loves.
Each man kills the thing he loves.
Yes, yes.
Each man kills the thing he loves.
Wait a minute.
My wife.
It's wax. And I thought
I had a front page murder.
Help! Help!
Yvonne.
- It's locked.
- Break it open.
"And so I find a thing to do
"with all her hair
"In one long raven string I wind
"three times her little throat around
"and strangle her
"No pain feels she"
- It's bolted from the inside.
- We've got to get it open.
"I am quite sure
"she feels no pain"
He's killing her! Get out of my way!
Yvonne, are you all right?
- Oh, Stephen.
- My darling.

The 52 nations which, under the name CIDALC,
make up the International Committee
for the distribution of the arts and literature in the cinema,
along with the four million war wounded and ex-servicemen,
united under the aegis CIAMAC,
are honoured to present,
with the aim of helping to maintain and safeguard peace:
I ACCUSE
A TRAGIC PORTRAIT
OF MODERN TIMES
I dedicate this film to the dead of the next war,
who will no doubt watch it sceptically
without recognising that it is about them.
Abel Gance
God damn it! Have you quite finished playing tennis with my carcass?
They've spotted us, lads!
Do not drink.
Contaminated water.
I've had it!
- Oh, a dove!
- What luck!
- We'll draw lots.
- It's mine!
Greedy pig!
Are you gonna scoff the lot?
Want some peas with it?
Anyone who touches it will have me to deal with!
Don't be stupid, Jean. You'll win.
Hey, pal.
- Are you from the Second?
- What of it?
- Do you know Jean Diaz?
- Yes, the trench cleaner.
Where is he?
There he is, burying the dove of peace.
- Who's that?
- François Laurin, the husband.
He found Jean Diaz writing letters to his wife.
- To Laurin's wife?
- Yes. Look at them.
Laurin's a hard man.
They'll kill one another.
How's the barometer?
The weather's fine.
It's stopped raining.
I don't understand.
What, that the war's become a private duel between us now?
Whichever one of us survives earns the right to love Edith.
Your attitude doesn't surprise me.
It's only natural.
All the same, I'm glad you didn't become Edith's lover.
You think your wife has remained faithful?
Yes, I think so.
That's why I wanted to make up with you.
Won't you shake my hand, Jean?
Yes.
As long as you don't forget...
That you still love Edith?
Yes.
No.
I can never forget that.
But I do acknowledge that when you fell in love with her, it wasn't your fault.
It's good of you to admit that.
I was very hard on Edith, brutal even.
She'd be happier with you.
Don't say that.
I say it because I think it, because it's the truth.
Listen, Jean.
Edith is my wife.
Isn't it natural that I should want to keep her?
Yes.
You said yes?
Yes.
That's part of our duel.
There.
That's all I wanted to say.
Goodbye, Jean.
Goodbye, François.
I hope now we can be friends when this is over.
Sure, why not?
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
It was bothering me, it's true.
I thought you two were going to kill one another.
Forgive me for listening.
All that talk about a duel, as you call it.
No good will come of it.
Even if you come out of it alive.
Suppose François is killed.
Well?
It would be a hundred times more dangerous for you.
Then his wife will really begin to feel sorry.
And so?
Well, then, with your character... you won't want to profit from his death.
Aren't you listening?
No, it's not that.
I'm watching.
Misfortune always looks the same.
You're not wrong there.
The cemetery is turning people away every evening.
Let's go and have a drink at Flo's.
Our brave boys at the front
What is their greatest want?
A woman
A woman
What kindly measure
Would give them pleasure?
A woman
A woman
Bastards!
Right now the thing they need
Is a saintly gift indeed
A woman
A woman
And so we pray with each day's end
The good Lord for us to send
A woman
A woman!
Cheer up, son.
Cheer up? We're sick of it.
We've been at it for four years.
That's 50 months!
What would you have done in the Hundred Years' War?
She's eyeing up Gilles Tenant!
Romeo and Juliet!
- Flo!
- Coming boys!
It makes me sad when you sing.
It's as if you were helping us to die.
Silly boy.
You're just sad because you're off to Verdun tomorrow.
It's not the first time, is it?
When it's the last, you won't be here to make light of it.
Douaumont?
That's nothing compared to Côte 304, and you know it!
Hands off!
It makes no odds.
The boys from the 15th just got back.
They say it's quiet at the moment.
You're lying.
Just listen to how quiet it is!
Don't worry, you know
I'll bring you good luck.
That Flo's a looker,
I really fancy her!
- Cut it out!
- It's true.
How's it going, Staminal?
We'd be OK if it weren't for the fact that each week
12 men must go out on patrol.
Ah, yes, the famous patrol.
Yes.
And they never come back?
Never.
It's been going on for 10 weeks.
10 times 12, that's...
92, isn't it?
- No, that makes 102.
- What?
I'll bet they were taken prisoner.
Prisoners?
The worms are eating them!
Talking of which, where's my grub?
He came back, though.
Jean Diaz, the death dodger.
He never comes here.
Who is he?
A former officer and interpreter.
He was retired and came back as an ordinary trooper.
He's a strange fellow, but I like him because he's brave.
And stubborn!
Want some?
No. See you later.
Shit!
That was a close one.
Look at that crater!
Let's get out of here, boys!
Flo! What do we owe you?
- I'll see you when you get back.
- Get back?
How does that new song go again?
Our brave boys at the front
What is their greatest want?
A woman
A woman
When they've eaten their ration
What arouses their passion?
A woman
A woman
And then to calm their nerves
What dessert must we serve?
A woman
A woman
To give in to her charms
And spend a moment in her arms
A woman
A woman
Goodbye, Flo!
That was lovely.
They're leaving happy, Miss Flo!
Goodbye.
What is it?
Nothing.
They've separated us, boys.
They're going to call the roll for leave.
I'm afraid it's for the patrol.
Don't be ridiculous.
They'd never dare send out another.
What's the point?
No one ever comes back.
They promised it was all over.
The chaplain's coming with us, so I reckon it's a burial party.
Maybe a guard of honour for the Generalissimo!
Maybe they're handing out decorations!
Boys, the Captain's here.
My friends, the 12 of you have been chosen by lots for the patrol of the Ravin des Dames.
I'd do anything to prevent your being sent.
You know, boys,
I got it wrong.
10 times 12 is 120.
With us that makes 132.
Why us?
I'd like to have watched the drawing of those lots.
And you, my young friend?
I have a request, Captain: if they find me, bury me in the square next to Flo's café.
And you, my friend?
Nothing, Captain.
No requests, Morat?
I hope they have enough trees to make crosses.
And you, Liotard?
I'm a machine for killing, not for talking.
And you, son?
Anything to reproach yourself for?
I haven't had much chance to sin these past four years.
To think I've made it this far only for this to happen.
It's hard.
Grisard?
I should have listened to my father and worked in a factory.
See you at dusk, then.
In one hour's time.
Look, there's Gilles Tenant crying in his corner.
Rémusad can't even light his pipe.
He's got three kids and an old mother.
And Damasot, talking to himself.
Don't make so much noise.
I'm trying to write!
That's the seventh letter to his wife!
What's it to you, rat face?
I'm so sick of this!
You're not the only one!
I'm sick of it.
It's a miracle I'm here.
As you're the only one who's ever come back, maybe you have some advice for my men.
If you like I'll tell them
I got into the pillbox.
I took this angel's hand to prove it.
There's a pillbox in the crypt of the church?
Yes.
Can I speak frankly, as an ex-officer?
Yes, of course.
Well...
I doubt a single one will return from this patrol.
The Major thinks the Germans are digging out of the pillbox, hence all these patrols.
Of course! Why else?
I give you my word that three days ago there were no tunnelling works.
I hear you.
I'll tell you anyway.
To reach us, it would take more than three days of tunnelling.
So it's pointless sending out another patrol today.
You're right.
I'll let the Staff Officer know.
He's a nice guy.
He's bound to understand.
- I'll send for you when he's here.
- Great.
In the meantime, will you have a word with my men?
- The ones who are leaving?
- Yes.
The fact that you came back from your patrol would encourage them and you'd be doing me a favour.
- Is François Laurin one of them?
- Yes. You two made up today, didn't you?
Only you can give them hope.
You can't deny them that.
No, I can't.
I brought this back from the pillbox a week ago, and here I am, talking to you, so...
Maybe the patrol won't go out.
Tell us again what the Captain said.
He said he'd send word to Headquarters.
Do you think they'll have second thoughts?
I don't know. I hope so.
You're just saying that to cheer us up.
You know we'll be going anyway.
No one really knows.
It's absolutely certain.
Leave him alone.
It's me Jean came to see.
Not especially.
Three quarters of an hour to go.
The worst thing about this war is the waiting.
For me it's the cold.
I feel as if I've been cold non-stop for the past three years.
You're forgetting the vermin.
The most disgusting thing about this last war is the filthy living conditions.
That I'll never forget!
Hey, Morat. You said "this last war".
- Was that a joke?
- Not at all.
Well, that's good, because I've got children.
So have I.
So what?
If I thought they'd have to endure what we've endured,
I'd go and blow my brains out.
You're a good fellow.
Not really. I'm just saying what we all think, no?
- Of course.
- Sure.
You said the one thing that is certain.
And I mean it.
Really certain.
What's that?
We are fighting the last of all wars.
- Do you really believe that, Jean?
- Yes, François.
I hope so too, but I think you're expecting too much.
No, he's right.
We won't all die.
Some will return home.
That's the reality.
As long as some survive, there'll never be another war.
Yes, but what about afterwards?
Afterwards?
There will never be another war,
I'm telling you.
- Explain yourself.
- Why?
Why?
Because of an idea I have.
I swear it.
It's a nice idea, but it's wishful thinking.
No, it's the truth.
I swear it.
Yes, well... all I know is, the war will soon be over.
I'd have been so happy, so happy to hear the ceasefire.
What I regret the most is never having kissed my youngest.
You know they wouldn't send a patrol unless it was necessary.
I get someone to call him.
You must speak to your Colonel.
If you like, but it won't do any good.
For God's sake!
The Germans haven't had time to dig a tunnel in three days.
- Yes, I'll tell him that.
- You'll do all you can to convince him?
Yes, I promise.
Listen, they want to speak to you.
- Listen, François...
- Leave me alone.
- Shit! Shit! Shit!
- Shut up!
I've got a right to speak!
Let them talk.
- Let me...
- No, don't worry.
I've been here a long time.
Here.
Take these letters.
They're all for Edith.
Listen, see that she gets one every two weeks.
I don't want her to know what's happened until the last possible moment.
- All right.
- Thank you.
You see, she'll read things in those letters, things I could never express while I was alive.
Excuse me.
I'd like to make sure this gets to my wife.
- Will you take care of it?
- Yes, of course.
What makes it so heavy?
Five gold coins.
Louise will need them.
Do you have any children?
Yes.
Four.
Did you tell the Captain?
What good would that do?
We were chosen by lots.
I can't help wondering what will happen to Hélène and Edith.
I can't make any promises,
François, but if I make it back...
Yes, you'll take care of my wife and my daughter.
Of course you will!
Why didn't I think of it sooner?
- That's a terrible thought.
- It's true, though!
- You still love Edith, don't you?
- Yes.
Then you'd be a saint if you weren't pleased that I'll soon be out of your way.
I'm no saint and I'm not pleased in the least.
All the same, you came to ask my permission to marry Edith.
No, I simply came to see you, to help you.
I felt I had to come now that we're friends again.
- We're not friends.
- You said we were.
That was before I knew you'd get my wife so easily.
I thought I'd make it home to defend myself.
- You talk as if I'm the enemy.
- You always have been, always will be.
- No.
- Yes!
It will be even harder for me, because I'll die thinking of you two and hating you.
Calm down, François.
- Nothing will calm me down.
- It will.
Just listen to me.
And look at me.
I swear to you...
Do you hear?
I swear to you that Edith will never mean anything to me.
Well? Are they going?
Yes.
What? The Colonel says they must?
No. He was away on urgent business.
- Then I don't get it.
- What?
You're free to stop them.
I don't have the authority.
I'm not free to decide.
When I get an order
I must carry it out.
What you're doing is despicable!
There are certain things even frontline officers don't understand.
Such as why to send a patrol to certain death?
You bet I don't understand that.
You think it's pointless?
You're wrong.
- Really?
- Yes.
If the enemy didn't know we were targeting the pillbox, they'd put their sappers in there.
Take it upon yourself to stop the patrol.
I can't believe you'd ask such a thing.
You know my duty prevents me.
Goodbye, old chap.
By the way, lads, if things get tough, to assemble the patrol... three taps on the helmet.
- Got it?
- Yes.
Your whistling gets on our nerves!
Stop whinging.
One, two, three...
Bastards!
Sons of bitches!
That was close.
380. We're off to a good start.
Do you understand?
Send one every two weeks.
Right.
And give this one to Damasot.
Why can't you give it to him?
It's a long story.
Listen.
Well?
I told him all that.
He telephoned the staff officer and insisted it was urgent.
And he wouldn't even see me?
No.
What's his name?
Henri Chimay.
Henri Chimay?
That's a name I'll never forget.
If he had any courage, he wouldn't have phoned.
He'd have stopped the patrol going himself.
You know that's impossible.
I can assure you, he's a brave man.
I was in Champagne with him.
What is it?
There's a lull, Captain.
The patrol can go.
Right.
I'll go and see them at once.
- Let them know.
- Yes, Captain.
Listen.
I want to leave with this patrol.
I'll take Damasot's place.
He's got four kids.
You can't refuse me.
You're not one of my men.
Just let the company know.
- You might be punished.
- So what? We'll never return.
You have no right!
I'm making it my right.
Good God!
DRINKING WATER
No, I can't.
Damasot, you're not going.
Jean Diaz asked to take your place because you have four children.
Thank you, old chap.
Thank you.
What about me, Captain?
I have nothing to say, my friends.
You have your orders.
Do your best.
You're mad!
- Haven't you done enough?
- Leave me alone.
It seems to me that we must take advantage of this lull and leave.
Here, son. Give this to Flo.
Over here!
Help me!
Help me!
Get me out of here!
Over here!
For God's sake help me!
”I'd' have been so happy, so happy to hear the ceasefire.”
Flo.
It's the armistice!
Victory!
Victory!
Long live the people!
Captain?
It's the patrol.
It's over! It's over!
The last...
The last to die in the war.
- Rémusad?
- Dead.
- Ligny?
- Dead.
- Staminal?
- Dead.
Jean Diaz?
Dead.
Langlade?
Dead.
- Liotard?
- Dead.
- Grisard?
- Dead.
- Laragne?
- Dead.
Tell me Gilles Tenant isn't dead and that he'll come back!
He'll come back, Flo.
No one found him.
Who'd have thought?
Let them be buried here, in the village that they defended unstintingly for 16 months.
It was their wish.
It's my final duty.
Bugler, sound the call.
- Evacuate?
- No point.
Let us make the sign of the cross together.
Keep your voices down!
He wants to be buried with his comrades.
Farewell, Staminal.
Someone cried out!
Hear that?
Jean!
He's not dead! Quick!
Take the other end! Quick!
Major, this one had a lucky escape.
He was about to be buried.
Of course he'll live.
Well?
Rest assured he'll pull through.
What about...
The other one?
I'll be back in a moment.
This one must be moved at once.
Yes, sir.
I'm losing you.
To arms, citizens
Form your battalions
March!
March!
Let impure blood
Water our furrows
To arms, citizens
Form your battalions
March!
March!
Let impure blood
Water our furrows!
Why isn't Daddy here?
Because he's at war.
I'll ask him to bring me back a gun.
A gun? What for?
So I can kill the war.
Why have you put me in a black dress?
We put black dresses on little girls whose fathers are at war.
All those lies!
I don't understand.
He wanted all those letters to be sent to you after his death.
That was even more cruel.
I answered every day!
That's probably what he wanted.
You should have told me.
There's no need to be so upset, Edith.
We did everything François wanted.
He thought of nothing else throughout the war.
Was he so sure he'd die when he wrote them?
Very sure.
Do you know how he died?
Yes, I do.
- Not on the last day of the war?
- No, long before.
Oh, Jean...
Here, look.
There was this little village full of flowers where not a single... stone remains.
Has Daddy gone far away?
Yes, sweetheart.
Daddy has gone far away.

RESEARCH LABORATORY
My dear Jean,
I love you more for respecting my mourning.
Months have passed and my heart beats again.
Why are you avoiding me?
I cannot live without...
Don't you love me anymore?
No, Edith.
I don't love you.
It can't be true. I don't believe it.
There's something else.
Is there... someone else?
I can't say.
Just answer me honestly.
It's easy to say yes.
If you say yes,
I won't trouble you anymore.
Is there... another woman?
No.
I couldn't hope for a better answer.
I promise that now...
I shall stop trying to find out what separates you from me.
Yes, but...
I can't stay here in Saint-Paul-de-Vence.
I shall have to leave now.
Perhaps it's better that way, Jean.
Did you rent a place near Douaumont?
Yes.
But that's where you were wounded the last time.
Not far from there.
I can see it from the window.
Do you think it's good for you to be in that atmosphere?
Not really, but that's where my life stopped.
That's where I must go.
We must let him go, Doctor.
Jean is too unhappy here.
As long as the glassworks are mine, you can continue your research.
Thank you for trusting me.
I won't let you down.
Take your time, Jean.
You'll be paid regularly.
- You're too kind.
- Nonsense.
- But you'll come back sometimes?
- Of course.
Anything special you'd like me to do?
Yes.
I'd like you to let me know at once if Helene or her mother gets sick.
- Fine.
- Passengers for Nice.
Mummy, what's the matter?
GALLWITZ SHELTER
JEAN DIAZ'S WORKSHOP
This evening, for the first time,
I have come back to you, my friends.
My 11 comrades, killed on the last day.
I know you can see and hear me.
Remember I said this war would be the last and your sacrifices would not be in vain?
Well...
Listen to me.
I live only for this promise.
Only to fulfil that promise.
I am just a poor man, alone, just a shadow, nothing.
But I have so much of your strength in me.
All the strength of the dead.
I shall be your voice and your hands so that the war of tomorrow may be stopped.
I swear it.
I who knew you and loved you.
I who love you.
Happy birthday, Jean...
Mummy, I'd love
Mr Jean to be my daddy.
What about you, Mummy?
You shouldn't say things like that.
Naughty girl!
What will Mr Jean say?
- Letters from Mr Jean.
- Go and get them, Hélène.
Naughty girl!
What will Jean think?
Nosey girl!
- Hélène!
- Coming!
Flowers from Mr Jean.
Jean must have the radio on now too.
I'm sure he has, Mother.
I want you to understand, Hélène.
I can't express it any better.
Jean is an intelligent and brave man but above all, he has a beautiful soul.
You're always thinking about him, Mother.
Why do you say that?
Because I think of him all the time too.
You love him, don't you?
If that were true, would it hurt you?
Terribly.
Darling Mother.
But I mustn't spoil your plans in any way.
But we haven't made any plans yet.
Listen, Mother...
If Jean still loves you, I must know.
You can't be jealous of the few looks, the few words
I've received in 20 years, and then only reluctantly.
No.
You're the only one he loves.
I must confess, Mother, even to make myself happy,
I wouldn't want to cause you sorrow.
I'm sorry, darling.
I'm being unjust.
This love between Jean and you was caused by me.
I spoke about him all the time.
I used you to get him to come here.
I loved knowing he was interested in my daughter.
It allowed me to see him and hear him from time to time.
Then one day in the garden, I remember,
I noticed him looking at you in a certain way.
I can tell you now...
I considered killing myself that evening.
Mother!
Don't worry, darling.
I'll never be so weak again.
Due to the death of Mr Pierrefond
the factory will remain closed until further notice.
I trust that you will take over the factory as Mr Pierrefond wished.
His adoptive son, Henri Chimay, knows nothing of this industry.
"Henri Chimay?
"That's a name I won't forget."
The balance sheet for the past six months.
You've done a splendid job.
I'm amazed you've succeeded so quickly.
The Minister is on the telephone.
- Tell him to call back later.
- Yes, sir.
Thank you.
He's to call back later.
We'll have to build new workshops.
The land has been bought.
I'll show you.
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?
These glassworks belong to you as much as me.
- That's not true.
- But without your methods...
No, I'm just an amateur.
If it weren't for you, the glassworks would still be as they were.
Then I'm pleased I came.
And became your friend.
That's not important, I assure you.
But I'm not wrong, am I?
I've always thought of you as my friend.
What's the matter?
Have you something against me?
No, no. Excuse me.
I must get back to work.
Hello?
The meeting tomorrow?
No, it won't be a political meeting.
I appreciate your coming, Minister.
You're exaggerating my influence.
You're not going up, Mr Diaz?
This is a real triumph for Mr Chimay.
You're not interested in politics.
Freedom is a prerogative of the Republic!
Armaments are indispensable to a free and strong democracy.
Progress has made us what we are and we shall build the future in spite of everything!
"Resist and persevere" is our motto.
Let "victory" be our rallying cry!
- Thank you for coming.
- You were wonderful.
A most excellent speaker.
Truly.
Were you waiting for me?
Why didn't you come up?
- I'm not interested in politics.
- Yes, I know.
Anyway, I think you're all wrong.
You're heading for disaster.
- My friend Jean Diaz begs to differ.
- Right.
Jean Diaz never argues.
No, he accuses.
You're right. I do accuse.
- But whom do you accuse?
- Not those who won the war?
No, I don't accuse those who won.
I accuse yesterday's war of creating today's Europe.
And I accuse tomorrow's war of preparing its destruction.
Tomorrow's war?
I accuse mankind of failing to learn any lessons from the last catastrophe, of waiting with folded arms for the next war.
I accuse the careless, the short-sighted, the egotists of having allowed Europe to be divided instead of building a permanent alliance.
And I accuse the men of today not only of failing to understand, but of laughing when reminded of the most beautiful expression on earth:
"Love one another."
And I accuse you same men of ignoring the voices of the millions who died in the war who have cried out to you these past 20 years:
"Stop!
"You're taking the same terrible path!"
We haven't chosen the same path.
The idea of a new war horrifies us.
But in order to survive we must struggle and overcome.
No!
In order to live... we must...
We must love.
Well said!
But that doesn't change the fact that France needs a leader.
Yes.
But the world seeks a heart.
Go.
Go and find the doctor.
- He's in the garden.
- He's not, he's at the hospital.
He is here.
Go to him.
I assure you he's here.
One day, 18 years ago,
François asked you to go into the garden because I was here.
I have just witnessed the exact same scene.
You've recreated yourself.
It's cruel to say it but Hélène is playing the part you once played.
She has your grace and your bearing.
Perhaps she will bring about the same drama.
Stay away from her.
If my love for Hélène pains you,
I'll say nothing to her.
Why do you love her?
I told you, she reminds me of you.
She is your reflection.
Don't say any more.
"I swear to you
"Edith will never mean anything to me."
But help me.
Help us!
François is watching us.
Thank you, Jean.
Thanks to those words,
I'll never stop loving Hélène.
But I love you too!
- Flo, another drink!
- Yes, Mr Gatineau.
Here, look at this.
Making proposals to the government!
You make me laugh.
You haven't a clue.
That's good.
Look, it's perfect.
It's striking.
It catches the eye.
Indeed.
- Many visitors today?
- Yes, three families.
Three families!
When I say three families,
I mean three women.
Yes, three women because... whole families don't bother coming anymore.
That's obvious.
I wonder what it is that keeps Flo here.
She likes to stay near the dead.
- And for dessert?
- An orange.
- Here. I thought you'd want that.
- Thank you.
- Mr Jean Diaz.
- Yes?
I've been meaning to speak to you.
- To me?
- Yes, but I didn't dare.
I'm off to see about my potatoes.
So long, old son.
In 1917 I was at Chattancourt.
Chattancourt?
You've heard of the Elephant Bar?
Sure, I went there often.
Then perhaps you remember Flo?
Yes, of course.
I'm Flo.
Forgive me.
And you live here, near the front?
Yes. I kept returning so I decided to stay.
You did so much good for the soldiers during the war.
Maybe you didn't realise.
Did you know Gilles Tenant?
An orphan.
He was in the same section as François Laurin.
Yes. He went out with the last patrol.
They never found him.
I'm still waiting for him.
Perhaps...
Perhaps, Flo.
I can't believe
I won't see him again.
Then you will see him again, Flo.
All my sad words must be boring you.
Far from it.
You're saying things I like to hear.
I wanted to say, it's not only because of Gilles that I came back here and can't drag myself away.
I knew too many of them, and they are still here.
You too... feel that they are still here.
I've found 42 of them whose voices I'm sure
I can remember.
The terrible thing is,
I can't forget their voices.
Perhaps it's because
I made them sing too often.
Yes, yes.
Anyway...
I wanted you to know there was someone else like you.
Someone like me...
Yes, someone who remembers.
I'm not staying.
The postman said you had received a letter from Jean.
Yes, here it is.
He speaks of his anti-war research.
He hopes it will succeed.
What a poet!
Does my interest in Jean surprise you?
I must admit it does.
He never writes more than 20 lines to me once a week.
That's strange.
- I thought...
- What?
No, I was going to say something silly.
Say it.
If you were waiting for my news,
I'd send you a letter in every post.
Then we are of the same mind.
DEATHS IN THE 1914-18 WAR
9 million dead, 17 million wounded
Flo?
Where did you spring from, Mr Jean?
I live here.
I was so afraid to come in.
Yes, I see. The scythe.
The grass here grows so high.
Is it true that there are passages leading to the cemetery?
Have you come to ask me something?
Only how you're getting on.
Well, I'm pleased, Flo.
I've done a lot of work.
And if I'm not mistaken, there won't be another.
Another what?
War.
If only that were true.
And yet they talk about it more and more often.
Yes.
- By the way, I must thank you.
- For what?
Because I was thinking only of my happiness.
I had almost forgotten about... them.
You've reminded me of my duty.
My Only duty.
What a quaint place.
It hasn't changed in 18 years.
It's Jean's wish.
His plans, formulas, inventions are scattered everywhere, as you can see.
Inventions for the Prevention of War by Jean Diaz
What a strange man.
You're suffering, Chimay.
Yes. I've decided to tell Hélène how I feel.
We both love her.
It's for her to choose.
What a drama that will be.
There's no other way.
I love her too much.

18th Experiment
Research in Mort-Homme cemetery:
248,415 dead
If I die during my research
please inform Edith Laurin in Saint-Paul-de-Vence.
Oh, my God!
The mud...
The mud on your face!
I'm afraid.
I can't stay in my house any longer.
What is it?
Your hair has turned completely white!
It's beyond all human understanding.
I beg you, Jean, to tell me what you do outside every night?
Never, since mankind has been on this earth, has anyone seen such a thing.
Explain yourself.
No.
I can't explain.
Touch me.
I'm speaking, aren't I?
I'm not mad, am I?
No.
My reason is intact?
Yes.
Then...it's not possible.
You must go tomorrow.
You can't stay here.
Yes, you're right.
It's too dangerous.
One shouldn't disturb the...
The what?
There they are.
No! Dear Jean!
No! No!
Don't go out there, Jean!
François!
Lagide?
- Gilles Tenant!
- Gilles Tenant?
Ligny?
Liotard!
Rémusad!
Come here!
You frightened me.
I almost succeeded.
Be quiet!
Edith, you have no idea.
It's beyond understanding.
20 years.
20 years I've been searching.
And I've found it.
Jean, come into the garden.
Hélène and Henri are waiting for you.
Give your mind a rest.
You've changed beyond recognition.
No.
I know very well what I'm saying.
Something has happened to me, something extraordinary.
So extraordinary... that I shall be unable to bear this fantastic secret for much longer.
But... if my health can withstand the tension I am experiencing
I'll be able to prevent another war.
I will prevent war.
Prevent war?
How?
That's a secret, between the earth and me.
I don't recognise my Jean.
- Your Jean?
- Our Jean if you prefer.
His work has been the ruin of him.
Did you see his face?
He didn't say a word to you.
I'm afraid for him.
You see, Hélène? I was right.
His concern for humanity has driven him mad.
- What about his secret?
- Come now.
That's just his utopian, poetic way of talking.
Add to that his war wound...
H's a pity.
A fine man like Jean.
So, how is Jean this evening?
He's overwrought, Doctor.
- Well, let's go and cheer him up.
- Yes, come on.
- There.
- I mentioned a walk in the garden.
Good idea.
Come on, let's go.
Well, Jean?
What about that walk?
Hélène's pretty, isn't she?
What do you mean?
Nothing more than what you think.
- Explain yourself. Why do you say that?
- No reason.
No reason.
Will you leave me alone with the doctor?
But...
I beg of you. Please.
My friend, I'm going to need you.
Of course. Speak, Jean.
I'll do anything you like.
Thank you.
I shall soon be leaving here.
I shall disappear forever.
And I would like you, once I have left, to pass on my final wishes to the two people I love the most:
Edith and Hélène.
I'll do that.
Why are you leaving?
Because...
Because the tragedy is now almost inevitable.
What tragedy?
The war.
Come now!
Surely you don't think so.
And you?
What do you think?
You're all blind to the facts.
The political horizon is darkening.
Squadrons are on the move.
War is on the way.
It's coming. I can feel it.
But I'll prevent it, my friend.
Yes, yes! I alone.
- I alone will stop it.
- Don't distress yourself...
I will stand in the way of this madness and I will stop it.
- I have the means.
- Jean, listen.
Alone!
I will be the one to stand up and shout, "No!
"It won't happen again,
"this stupidity,
"this abjectness,
"this monstrous absurdity.
"It won't happen again.
"The murder of millions of innocent people
"will not happen again.
"I, Jean Diaz,
"stand up and proclaim the sacred right to life.
- "I stand up and I accuse..."
- Jean!
"I accuse... I accuse...
- "I accuse..."
- Jean! What's wrong?
Hélène!
"I accuse!"
- "I accuse!"
- Hélène!
"I accuse!"
Jean! Jean!
"I accuse!"
Jean, stop!
Jean, Jean...
- Jean!
- Help me! Hold him!
- Jean!
- He's gone mad.
- Jean!
- It's his war wound, Hélène.
Put him on the bed.
I'll be right back.
Quick, drive to Nice and bring me Dartois, the great psychiatrist.
What are those doctors doing?
What did Professor Dartois say?
- He's examining him carefully.
- And the truth?
Jean has gone...
Do you think all the excitement he experienced today brought it on?
No.
A shell fragment in his head from the war has shifted.
- I...
- No.
- But I must.
- No. Stay here.
Later.
I can't believe it.
Am I mistaken or are you not bothered that he's gone mad?
- Mother!
- Hélène.
Oh, no.
He's ill, very ill.
Excuse me.
This is us in Venice.
Oh, look at Henri being a gondolier!
Jean didn't seem too upset about us leaving.
No. His poor head is still so removed from everything.
He was so used to seeing all three of us.
Yes, but he's dead to all human feelings now.
Why did you come back so soon?
- Was our absence so pleasant?
- Don't be silly, Helene.
How could we honeymoon when Europe is mobilising?
Oh, that's right. I'm so stupid.
But that's been going on for months so I thought...
There's Henri.
Off you go, darling.
What are you doing here?
Hello, darling.
Hello, my love.
EUROPE IN ARMS
Perhaps Jean could have prevented it.
Don't believe it, darling.
No one can prevent war.
It's inevitable.
We must face up to it and prepare for it with all our strength and faith.
We must see humanity as it is, and not as he wanted it to be or as it should be.
I have work to do, my dear.
This morning's news is not good.
Sir, you're speaking in Angoulême tomorrow,
Marseille on Monday,
Nancy on Saturday and tonight at the Vél d'Hiv to celebrate our party having two million members.
Yes, I know. Thank you.
Yes, all the precautions are in place.
An aerial attack?
Your attention, please.
The news worsens by the minute.
The government asks the people of Paris
to remain calm and disciplined.
Verdun.
Douaumont.
Fleury.
François!

Here is an announcement by the Minister for War:
The forces of evil are gathering.
Dark storm clouds are upon us.
The grave question of the day is: how do we prevent these evil forces
from spreading throughout Europe?
Hello?
Hello.
- Is this directory inquiries?
- Speaking.
Can you tell me where I'm calling from?
Which town?
Yes, yes. I want to know the name of the town I'm calling from.
This is no time for stupid jokes!
A LEADER: HENRI CHIMAY
It is better to reveal one's strength than to have to use it.
Henri Chimay has given his country
the magnificent invention of steel-glass armour.
Not only has it provided France with its best arms defence...
TO HENRI CHIMAY
FROM A GRATEFUL NATION
Edith!
When I think of the catastrophe that is about to strike the world,
I can't bear to be away from you.
You must remain calm, my dear.
Maybe I'm horribly selfish, but I don't want anything to ruin my happiness.
The war will do just that.
Strange that no one knew where and when he was killed.
They did.
Jean knew, I think, but he refused to say.
I see.
First my father and now they want to take my husband.
No, no.
Don't call anyone.
Don't be afraid of me.
I've just woken up.
And I know...
I know war is here.
And I know they've stolen my formula for steel-glass to make a fortune and to wage war.
I know I've been betrayed.
I've seen Hélène in Henri's arms.
I know they're married!
Why?
Why did you allow it?
Jean, calm down.
Yes, it's true.
Well, I shall destroy their love.
I shall annihilate it with a single word.
What will you do, Jean?
I shall say one word to link Henri Chimay to a point on this map.
No, Jean, I beg of you!
If you do that, you'll kill me and destroy Hélène's happiness.
I don't care what you do to me, but spare her, I beg you.
Spare my daughter.
They're coming.
Henri must be with her.
She's my daughter.
I'm begging you.
Do you think he's unwell?
He's paler than usual.
He looks more unhappy.
Mother, why are you trembling?
You're scaring me.
Please don't get so upset!
Mother!
I must get dressed so I can see the Minister with Henri.
I'll fetch the doctor.
Call me straight away.
And get my things ready.
His things?
Yes, he's leaving.
He just decided.
War is certain now.
Special edition!
Negotiations break down!
Come with me, Hélène.
See you later, Mother.
They thank you, Jean.
I thank you.
No.
It's better like this.
I have escaped the risk of happiness.
I'm sorry for all the harm we have done you.
I'm the one who must ask forgiveness.
When I awoke, I could only find words of anger and hatred.
And yet...
I should have been... in awe of the marvellous discovery I made.
What discovery?
That there exists a woman in the world who is capable of loving a madman.
WAR INEVITABLE
Read all about it!
Negotiations break down!
Europe is mobilising!
Negotiations break down!
Read Paris-Soir
We shall never meet again, Edith.
I'm leaving.
Now and forever.
Oh, no, no, no!
Be brave.
You must understand that I cannot stay here.
You can tell people it was madness or an accident, so long as Hélène doesn't suffer.
Besides...
I have something to do there.
For the war?
Before the war.
You remember what I told you one evening?
- I must prevent war.
- I'm afraid you're losing it again.
No,no,no.
It's not my ideas that drove me mad.
It's one tiny piece of the war that has stayed with me, here.
Farewell.
Our first... and last kiss, Edith.
For a man like you to be so unhappy is so unfair.
To make unhappiness bearable we must try to give happiness to others.
I only hope I'm in time.
What are you going to do, Jean?
I'm going to keep my promise to the dead of Verdun.
I have come.
Did I understand your orders?
Am I the chosen one?
I am ready.
Is this the moment?
I will comply.
François Laurin and the rest, my friends.
I have returned to you.
I need you.
Listen.
Your sacrifice was in vain.
The living want to go to war again.
But I, your spirit and your will on earth,
I oppose it.
This is the hour of our pact.
Help me, my friends, my brothers, my comrades.
One of your own is speaking to you, crying out to you.
Men are going to war again.
I'm calling for help.
You must hear me.
You must!
I'm calling you!
I'm calling you!
I'm calling you!
I'm calling you!
I'm calling you!
Dead of Verdun, arise!
I'm calling you!
You, soldier laid to eternal rest by war,
I'm calling you!
IN MEMORY
OF THE FRENCH SOLDIERS
WHO SLEEP STANDING UP,
A GUN IN THEIR HAND
Arise!
German soldiers of the Great War, arise!
I summon you!
Why are you drawing the curtains?
I don't want to see those crosses moving.
He's had too much red wine!
I haven't touched a drop!
Just now I saw...
Stop it! You're all mad.
We can't all be mad.
It's impossible.
And why not?
They call it... What was it?
Collective hallucination.
It can happen.
I haven't seen or heard anything.
You're drinking because you're scared.
Me, scared? I'm off.
Will you come with me, lads?
Let's go.
After you.
The dead of Mort-Homme, arise!
I'm calling you!
I can't understand it.
It's going from dark to light and back again every minute.
I've never seen a sky like it.
If the animals are scared something must be wrong.
There's gonna be a squall.
It smells of sulphur!
Gabriel!
Gabriel, listen to me.
All the crosses have disappeared.
You're crazy!
I swear, Gabriel, all the crosses have disappeared.
It's the storm.
We're upset by the war.
We're going.
Everyone's leaving.
- Where to?
- I don't know but let's go.
This whole place is coming down.
Shh, listen.
Look!
There he is.
Well?
I don't get it. Nobody can get through.
There's an awful traffic jam.
- What are people saying?
- It's all nonsense, ghost stories.
There's fear in the air.
- What about the war?
- War? It's been declared, apparently.
I'm calling you!
Sailors of all the seas killed in the war,
I'm calling you!
Airmen of all the skies killed in the war,
I'm calling you!
Artillerymen, infantrymen, cavalry of all countries killed in the war,
I'm calling you!
My 12 million comrades killed in the war, upon whom men, blind and deaf, have walked for 20 years, arise, all of you!
The living want to go to war again.
I'm calling you!
I'm calling you!
Arise!
François!
Gilles Tenant!
TO THE 10,000 DEAD HEROES
WHOSE BLOOD SOAKS THIS EARTH
Come on!
No! It can't be true!
Dead men walking!
What a joke!
Here he is.
Tell him what you saw.
Well?
What was that about the dead?
I saw them!
With my own eyes!
They're coming from everywhere.
Thousands of them, hundreds of thousands.
German, Italians, Russians.
Dead from every country.
They're going in all directions.
It's as if they were searching for their country, their village, their town.
It's enough to drive you mad!
It's the enemy.
War has broken out.
They're pulling a big hoax on us.
It's the enemy dressed as ghosts.
We must hold our nerve and shoot them as they pass.
It's no use trying to lead us on with your tall stories.
The war is behind this.
In France we believe our own eyes.
I'll believe it when I see it.
He's right.
They're coming! They're coming!
I just went to the cemetery.
I saw them!
Take a good look at them
and let the desire to fight
be forever quelled in you.
Fill your eyes
with this horror
and let the weapons fall from your hands.
Operations suspended!
Don't talk nonsense!
Panic?
That's a good one!
Hello? Hello?
Call HQ right away.
They're not answering, sir.
I'm calling you!
Rapid Force 207 stopped in their tracks?
Panic-stricken soldiers?
Have we been betrayed?
All continental trains have been stopped.
The most amazing rumours abound.
- It's incomprehensible.
- During mobilisation?
Hello? Hello?
TERROR IMMOBILISES EUROPE
That's impossible!
ALL THE DEAD HAVE RISEN
FROM THEIR GRAVES
I'm calling you!
There are moments in history when a terrible blow, an upheaval that shakes society to its bones, strikes on all fronts.
Such a moment is upon us.
The dead remained in our villages, in our fields, all around us, within us, waiting for the living to act
as we are doing right now!
The abolition of war,
of all wars!
As a result of deliberations by the Universal Assembly war is formally abolished.
Immediate disarmament has been unanimously declared.
War is dead!
The world is renewed!
This film, made in 1938, won the SDN gold medal in 1939
and America's prestigious four-star award in 1940.
It was shown in France a few months before the war.
Its success is irrefutable evidence
that the French championed universal peace
and exercised their right to counter violence and tyranny.
Echoing a time when Nazism was lurking in our shadows,
the value of this work is that it was a premonition.
May it speed up the final victory of the "offensive for peace"
for which France has always been in the vanguard.

3 and 6 of thimble full

What are you dreaming about?
Talk
Do they talk,your charming patrons
You ever understand what they say in their dreams?
Not a word,Mr Roorich
Their dreams is too pleasant
Have another,it'll make six
Here
5 is 10 shillings 3 shilling and sixpence for a thimbleful! I'll tell you
And you only leave 5 bobs
-Good Evening,Mr Dean
-Good Evening
Mr Jasper was took a little poorly,Sir
Say taken to the Dean
And how was Mr Jasper taken?
-Mr Jasper was that breathed
-Breathless to the Dean,Durdles
It was some sort of a fit it seemed to me
Poor Mr Jasper has been going up to London
 twice a week for treatment,Sir
But he will soothe for that
 it is nothing serious
Indeed I trust not
Jack
Ned
Oh my dear Edwin I didn't
 expect you so soon
Let me take your coat
Aren't your feet wet? Pull your boots off
My dear Uncle I'm dry as a bone
There's slippers in your room
Don't mollycoddle me, I'm 21 you know
But it's hard enough to
You must remember I made a habit of it for 14 years
Would it be mollycoddling you to give you a hot drink
Oh,good old fellow
Up to much to the old days
When you are 34 you won't want to be called old
Don't be silly
You have find my sketch of
 Rosa in a place of honour
Yes,Ned
It's the best drawing you ever made,that's why I put it there
I should be able to catch that capricious expression,I've seen it often enough
I don't find it on her face when
 I go to see her,I leave it there
Come in
Well if it isn't Mrs Tope
Lovelier than ever,give me a kiss because tomorrow is Rosa' birthday
Your Uncle spoiled you, young man,that's what it is
I think you have the right to make ??with anyone
I've a mind to tell Miss Rosa on him
And you engaged to her in your cradle
When two people are engaged ,they are cradles
There are a certain flatness to it
Everything is settled before you begin
You know I almost envy you Jack
Your life hasn't been measured up for you
You envy me?
As you are free and independent, respected as a lay clerk here
And chose your own society, no wife when you want one,
One of the most popular man in Cloisterham
I hate it here
The cramped monotony of my existence grinds me away
 How does our service sound to you?
Beautiful! Quite celestial
It often sounds to me quite devilish.
I am so weary of it all
No wretched monk who ever droned his life away in that gloomy cathedral can have been more tired of it
He could take to carving demons for relief and did
What shall I do?
Must I take to carving them out of my heart
I thought you had so exactly found your niche in life,Jack
They all think so
Rosa think so
When did she say so?
The last time I was here
How did she phrase it?
She said you were made for your vocation
How's she doing with her music?
Need more lessons
She won't be taking many more lessons from you,Jack
I know it
I'm going to Egypt after Christmas, that engineering job is all settled
I might as well marry her
 and take her with me
But she is still a child, she's still in school
She's 18 tomorrow
Does Rosa know about this?
I came down to tell her
-Miss Rosa Bud,please
-Yes,Sir
-You sit in Miss Twinkleton's parlour
-Thank you
-Oh don't Eddy
-Don't what,Rosa?
Coming in nearer
-So absurd
-What's absurd?
To be an engaged orphan
You've given me an affectionate
 welcome,I must say
Well, I will in a minute, Eddy, but I
 can't just yet.A acidulated drop
How do you do,Mr Drood.Very glad indeed
 to have the pleasure.Pray excuse me.
Tweezers.Thank you
-Your birthday present
-Gloves?
How did you guess?
Because you gave me gloves last year and the year before
Don't let's start nagging
Sorry,my fault
Thanks for the gloves
All the girls gave me presents
We had a dance last night
Without any partners? How dull
Chavey girls pretended to be their brothers
It WAS so droll
-Did anybody pretended to be..
-To be you?-Yes
Indeed yes,and I refused to dance with you
-But why?
-Because I was so tired of you
Don't be angry,you were just as tired of me
I trust I disturb no one; but there WAS  paper-knife
Mr Drood is well; though I needn't ask,
 if I may judge from complexion
I have something very important
 to tell you,a decision I've come to
Then let's go for a walk
Has anybody seen my pearl button-holder?
Can we go for a walk,Miss Twinkleton?
You can ,the question should
 have been,may you
You may
Think of all we can see out there
Sphinx,the pyramids, the hot sun
But I don't want to go to Egypt
??moneyed and fanned
But you are 18 if we are going to do it the way
our parents wanted us to we'd better get it over with
I suppose so
Give me a kiss,a quick one
Nobody is looking
Can't,you stick it
You never want to kiss me
-What are you eating?
-Lumps-of-Delight
What's that?
A Turkish sweetmeat, don't
 you know anything?
-Might after eat one
-Sorry that was the last
That's Jack,poor fellow he's
 going to miss us
I don't like it here,do you?
Oh,we had not a very happy walk,have we?
We seem to try one another
I am a young little thing to have an old heartache
But I really,really have sometimes
Don't be angry with me
-I know you have one too
-Shut up
We may be happy yet
You are sticky
Oh,why couldn't I ??????
I am very fond of you and yet
I don't have any more fun walking with you than I do walking with Miss 
Twinkleton and the girls
Now young ladies,remember
eyes sat modestly down,hands crossed, step neatly paced and no indecent exposure
 of the ankles,let us proceed
No staring,no giggling,no laughing and no swishing
Look,Neville,now we can see
 the spires of the cathedral
Such sleepy place it looks
All these changes behind us and no more comfort
I cheated already
Careful with that whip,my man, you know it can cut my face
I know how to handle a whip,Sir
Forgive me
All right,Neville,go back in the vehicle
Now behave yourself
-Your hat,Sir
-Thank you
-Good Morning
-Good Morning
Young ladies,order
A crisis is a test of breeding. 
Remember you're Britains!
Let us proceed
Miss Helena Landless,I presume
I'm Septimus Crisparkle and we are to tutor your brother
How do you do
My brother jumped off the coach
Your brother jumped off the coach?
We had a ?? ???
Well,however he may be,Mr Crisparkle,I am
 glad you have that heathen by you
-Oh,Neville,are you all right?
-Yes,of course
Welcome to Cloisterham,Mr Landless
-I'm Crisparkle
-How do you do
Oh,please Neville
Tomorrow you're my pupil, but
 today you are my guest.
George,send the rest of the rest of the luggage up to my house,this way
You're very kind
My mother is expecting you both to dinner
She's inviting three young
 people to meet you
So you won't think everybody here is edgy
For you,my mother dear
I accept they are the last of the season
They are just the colour of the roses of your cheek
Oh,I do hope the roast didn't overdone
I wished we hadn't come to England
I'd rather be shot than meet them
At least you have the name of our jailer
You don't have to be cooked up in a school with a lot of giggling girls
Being cooked up is detestable
Miss Landless
Yes,Mr Crisparkle
Miss Twinkleton,let me present Miss 
Helena Landless your new pupil
How do you do
And  Mr Neville Landless,my new pupil
How do you do
Miss Bud
This is Miss Landless who is to be your new school mate
How do you do
And her brother
How do you do
You're the one brought in
 the London coach
Yes
From Ceylon I believe bounded on the north side in the Indian Ocean
Bounded on the south by the Indian Ocean
I see you know
How do you do
Oh Miss Landless
Helena,I'm so glad you are room with me,we are going to be such friends
-Thank you,Miss Bud
-No,Rosa
Isn't it an absurd name Rosa Bud
Of course they all call me Rose Bud,
I hate it,you won't,will you?
Never
-Neville
-Yes
Mr Drood,this is my guest and pupil,Mr Neville Landless
How are you,have you been
 in England before?
No
-From Sumatra you said?
-Ceylon
Oh,Ceylon, I'm sorry,where the tea comes from,isn't it?
Will everyone please come to table
-Miss Twinkleton,on my son's right
-Thank you Mrs Crisparkle
And you sit on the second feet on the left
You look very lovely tonight,my dear pupil
Thank you,Mr Jasper
-Mr Neville,you sit next in row with me
-Thank you
-And you sit next to me
-Thank you
Perhaps in going like you in Ceylon 
I think it will be to see the island
It is an island,isn't it?
It is an island
I love your sister,Mr Landless
I'd never jealous of my sister until this minute
Look at Rosa,flirting with him
You think she'll look at me like
 that after she married me?
Is Rosa going to marry you?
Yes,of course,didn't you know?
We've been engaged since we were babies
I hope you both be happy here
You doubt it?
Cloisterham must seems so?? in Ceylon
I had no idea what Ceylon is like
Ceylon is hell
England with people like you
 living in it must be heaven
I want to propose a toast
To the most charming young lady in Cloisterham
On the occasion of her 18th birthday
May she always be cherished as she is now
Rosa
I didn't know she had birthday
?? always inspired me
Listen may I have a word with you
-Alone?
-Now?
On something this..
Well my boy
I've got to tell you,I can't hide things
My sister and I came here telling the quarrel but you'd gone away
Really
Heavens name,what?
We hated everyone who ever had charge of us before so we made up our minds to hate you
Me
I took a knife to my stepfather
That's why we were sent to England
I surprise you,Sir
You unspeakable shock may..
Have you ever seen a man beat your sister?
Why are you telling me all this?
Because you're kind,and I'm grateful to you
And.. I mean do...
Play the game by you
Only
You have to make allowances
 for my violent temper
I wish I'll charge you
-Shall we go in?
-Yes
Just one question,Sir
Please
This Mr Edwin Drood is he? 
Is Miss Bud a relation with his?
No,but they are soon to be married
So that's it
Thank you
Trying???
Rosa is not used to an audience
Miss Landless,will you get her salt
Go quick,Helena,please
You're such a conscientious,Master Jack,
I believe you make her afraid of you
-No wonder
-No wonder
You would be afraid of him too,wouldn't you?
Not on any circumstances
Jack's gone Rosa
I don't think he liked to be charged of being the monster that frightened you
Ten o'clock
Come my dear
A very Good Night to your husbands
But I'm glad you are giving
 so much presents
-Good Night,Gentlemen
-Good Night,thank you for your escort
-Good Night
-Come here,ladies,Miss Landless
How all girls have a pitch of the vapours
The men never no why
You bare lucky to have a sister like Miss Helena
You are luckier being engaged
 to a girl like Miss Rosa
Cloisterham is a hotbed of gossip
Is it bad form,Sir,to refer to an approaching marriage?
Not an ordinary one
Why is yours extraordinary?
We don't cross examining people in England
Heavens,I though it was ridiculous about my name
Ridiculous? You ought to be proud of it
I don't know what people are most
 proud of they ???with strangers
They prefer to call it ridiculous
In England,just on make the rules
 and mind their own business
And in Ceylon,gentlemen use respect
 when speaking of their women
Perhaps you have to go back there, clearly you don't belong here
Ned,Ned,Ned
What's wrong here?
Nothing worth to kick in,Jack
Just a little exhibition of
 Ceylonese manners
Ned
Mr Landless is a stranger here
We are his hosts
I ask for no allowances from you or anyone
Young blood,hot blood
Now come,we should drink a toast to each other in my bachelor gatehouse
Now what can two people who have only just met find a quarrel about?
Obviously nothing
There has been no quarrel
You will be a friend of me,won't you Rosa?
I need a friend
Helena I'm terrified
Mr Jasper?
He haunts my thoughts like a dreadful ghost!
When I am undressed I
I feel as he were looking
 through the wall at me
-No,no,Rosa
-I know it's absurd
But I feel as I was never safe from him
When I play
He never takes his eyes from my hands
And when I sing he never takes his eyes from my lips
Till I see??
-As he was threatening
-Threatening what?
Threatening who?
I don't know
I don't even think or wonder
Does Mr Drood knows how
 this man affects you?
Oh no,no I couldn't tell him,he loves Jasper
Jasper has done everything for him
I'd never told anyone but you
Somehow the glaze comes over his eyes
He seems to wonder away into a frightful
 sort of dream and take me with him
You've been staring at that portrait,Mr Neville
Yes
It scarcely flatters the original
Don't be hard upon it,it was done by Ned
If I known I was in the artist's presence
Just a little sketch of mine,Sir
I am sorry,Mr Drood
Here
If Rosa is a good girl,one of these days I'll do a real portrait of her
One you may approve of
Come.Mr Neville,we'll you drink to Ned?
Mr Neville
Ned
You and I aren't lucky,are we Mr Neville?
It may not be as fine as all that
Maybe we won't hit it off
Hey,Rosa
It might have been better for Mr 
Drood to known some hardships
Yes
And may we know why?
It might have made him more
 sensible of good luck
Have you ever known hardships may I ask?
I have
And was it made you sensible of?
-I told you once before
-You've done nothing of the sort
Then I'll tell your vanity is intolerable
Your conceit is beyond endurance
You talk as if you were some rare and precious prize,you don't deserve
-Ah
-Oh
So that what it is
We,English,don't encourage fellows
 with dark skin to admire our girls
You
Ned
That black
-He meant murder
-No,he dropped the knife
We were both drunk
Mr Crisparkle I
You are not sober,Neville
I'm afraid not,Sir
I've done something terrible
Well?
You see
I admire Miss Rosa,Sir,so very much
I just can't bear her to be treated with conceit or indifference
What did you do?
Drood insulted me
Grossly
I've lost my temper
And
And I drew a knife on him
Neville
What's to be done with you
I love Rosa,Sir
Do you realize what you are saying?
I love her with all my heart
But she and Drood are to be married almost at once
He's not worthy of her
-He talks of her as..
-Neville
You must learn to fight down this sudden infatuation
No good can come of it
Good Night
I'm sorry
All right but
It's no use being sorry if you don't learn to control your temper
Go to your room and try to sleep
-Jasper? Won't you come in
-No thank you,Crisparkle
I've come to return Neville's hat
It's no fault of his that he didn't kill my nephew
He's very repentant
I dread to think what may happen when those two come together again
-Good Night
-Jasper!
We must keep this quarrel tonight as secret
I assure you,I'll be the last to wish it known
He looked wildly at the wall??of
 life and whipped it out???
That young heathen
Left and right,he's snatching around with his knife
He?? on the wall on Mr Jasper's??
And just driving Mr Droods on
Perfectly scandalous man,threw a knife and fork at Mr Drood
Then up with the decanter and threw that at Mr Drood
It seems that Miss Landless brother threw
 a complete dinner set at Mr Drood
A 128 pieces
What will Rosa do?
That's all there was to it
You understand Miss Rosa?
I wanted to be the first to
 tell you about this quarrel
That's kind of you,Mr Landless
I know how you must feel
And how you must blame me
Why only you?
But I lost my temper
Eddie can be too provoking
-He often makes me cross
-I won't let it happen again
Promise?
Yes
I promise
You can apologize,can't you?
Apologize?
You can't ask that of him,Rosa
But think
Unless they make it up we..
We shan't all see each other
Be friends
Of course,I'll apologize
I'll promise you I'll shall
I can't let you go to Egypt remembering
 the worst of me
My poor Neville
She forgave me
Being a particularly angular man, who doesn't fit into the social circle
I'm not used to giving anything away
Least of all a young lady on her wedding
But Mr Grewgious you're Rosa's guardian between now and next week there's any time to find a substitute
If you won't give me away no one else shall
My apprehension is a little dull but that seems to
Settle it
I have now a personal trust to discharge
My dear Miss Rosa
Though I know nothing of the softer side of life
Yet I feel that the wishes of the dead who loved you both
Are worthy of your attention
Your mother
As she lay dying
Took this ring from her finger
Give this,she charged me,to Mr Drood's boy
Tell him to place it on Rosa's finger if you have so truly deeply with all his heart,if not
Command him from the dead to give the ring back to you
I accept the responsibilities,Sir
Oh isn't it beautiful
Did my father give it to her?
On the day they then first plighted their faith
Hard man as I am
I should hate to see such a trust to the living,Rosa
And the dead,your mother
Abused
Bless my Soul
I thank you my dear
The
The honour it almost equal to the pleasure
Good Morning
Oh,Eddie you are a darling
From now on we're brother and sister
Never be husband and wife
-Never
-Of course you're right
I've noted too but I've tried not to admit it to myself
But it's natural we should both feel sorry
But how much better this way
Now we can always like each other
Always
Rosa
Are you interested in Neville Landless?
He's certainly not interested in me
He doesn't call at the school anymore
Don't you know why?
He loves you,and then he thinks we were to be married,don't you see?
Do you really think that's it?
I know it,I quarrelled because he felt I wasn't good enough for you
Well,don't quarrel anymore will you?
Why should we
-And you make it up
-Of course
Your old Jack's arranging a little peace on earth supper for Neville and me
I'm so glad
Rosa
If you love him I wish you both luck
What will the girls say
What will all Cloisterham say next week's wedding called off, what will be the gossip
Poor Jack is going to take this hard
Let's not tell him yet let not spoil his Christmas
All right
One must give the ring back to Mr Grewgious
No I won't I'll keep it a while
Then if you and Neville should come to an understanding
Oh,Eddie for the first time
I very much want to kiss you
Good Evening,Durdles
Whom you've come to bury,Mr Choirmaster
Why don't you remember,Durdles?
You promised me to take me around
 the crypts by moon light
It's a wonder ?? you aren't tired of the cathedral
I am a bit of an antiquary
I have an eye for beauty and a mind to see the spirits at midnight
You bring the spirits and 
Durdles?? your own
I noticed it was a cold night
It's always a cold night to Durdles
We're taped them spirits
Better then you can get in the taproom
Even stronger I'll get my keys
Why,Durdles,you are undermined with pockets
They open the crypts
They open the monuments
And they opens the way to the tower
And they open the cathedral
Mr Choirmaster
These gravestones all mine
You're like a popular ordainer
 surrounded by his works
Come on Durdles
Widdy widdy wen!
Widdy widdy wen!
Here you wait what
 are you doing?
I throw rocks at him
Give me that stone
It's Deputy,I'll give him a penny to stone me home at night
When it's drink it's the only way I can get home at all
Please and now you leave me alone
Away with you now,Durdles has the reason to be out with him tonight
This way Mr Jasper
I gave that boy an object in life
At the??, nor a window,nor a horse,nor a dog,nor a cat,nor a bird,nor a fowl,nor a pig
What that boy has in stone for want of an????
Now he stoned you
Ay,Durdles give him three pence a week
I'm wondering if he has no competitors for the job
He has but he stones them all away
Here we are
Well, that's lime,Mr Jasper
What you call quick-lime
Ay,quick enough to eat your bones
Anything new down here,Durdles
There's ain't no place for novelty
Your always finding more
 ?? as you call them
There was an old one
An archbishop
Durdles find him last Michaelmas
Slides right into coffin with a??
And there he lies
Crock and mitre all
An he gives Durdles a look with his open eyes as much as they say
I've been looking for you for a devil of a long-time
And then he turned into dust
What I dwell upon most is the remarkable ease with which you seem to find where people are buried
It is just so
Durdles will show you
Here they are all???????
You pitch a note when you sing ,don't you?
Right
Just so,so Durdles sounds his notes
Empty
Solid
Still solid
What's in here?
That
Empty
Come on Durdles,you'll freeze here
Durdles no freeze
Where does this lead to?
That's the way to the Tower
Sleepy?
Strongest of the ....
You stay here,I'll find my way to the belfry
Wake up Durdles
Durdles it's past one o'clock
Why didn't you wake me?
I couldn't
We'd better take this with us, come on,let's hurry,it's late
Nothing rises as ever, happen to Durdles before
Widdy widdy wen!
That's him again
-You were watching us
-I wasn't
I was getting home,I got all my money in???
He's been spying on us
Don't hurt the boy,Mr Jasper,
Thank you,Durdles
Good Night
Widdy widdy wen!
Thank you,thank you
Boys,it's best to run home before it starts to rain
We will
Why do have stick?
Walking tool,yes
What does Mr Crisparkle thinking of you going away like this
Just before Christmas time
He knows I'm having a miserable
 struggle with myself
And he thinks that the change will do you good?
Besides
If I am not here all the rest of you can dine cheerfully with him tomorrow
It's time for me to go out
I wish I wasn't going to Jester's dinner for a moment
Maybe a little awkwardness
But you are sure of yourself?
I wish I felt as sure of everything else, as I feel of myself
Strange you speak
-What do you mean?
-I don't know
I only know I don't like it
But I promised her
-Good Night
-Good Night
Are you ill?
What are you doing here?
I came looking for someone
But I ain't found him yet
There is no time to look for anyone
Why don't you go home and get warm
I need 3 and six pence to get home
Give me
Only 3 and 6 pence
-Here you are
-God Bless you,Bless you
What's your Christian name?
Jack,Jack Robinson,why?
Be thankful that it ain't Ned
Why?
It's a bad name just now
How so?
A threatened name,a dangerous name
Threatened men live long
Then Ned is so threatened, he'll live forever
Would you come in?
My company waits bad manners in a host
I'm sorry,you've never been merrier in your life than you was tonight
I've never felt a better spirit
Because you are a peace maker
Wasn't it better???coming in my custody shaking hands
Well I would bet,if I ever did bet that your company will have a gay host tonight
-Good Night see you tomorrow
-Good Night
Let me venture to suggest to the very Rev the Dean
That Cloisterham has never seen such a storm during my incumbency as Mayor
The powers of evil seem to have been abroad last night
Crisparkle
Crisparkle
Crisparkle
Yes,yes,Sir
Crisparkle,where is my nephew?
How should I know?
But he he left my house last
 night with Neville Landless
Mr Sapsea,my nephew is missing
Calm yourself my dear,Sir
No one has ever stayed missing since I was Mayor
Beg you pardon,Sir,is Mr Landless that dark,foreign looking young gentleman
-Yes
-Ay,I've seen him
Across the bridge to the high road,eh
When he whispered ??sounds,bundle he had
Was he alone?
He's run away
Nonsense,he's gone on a walking tour
Are you a pack of thieves?
I won't surrender
-He is here,Your Honour
-Bring him in
Bring him in
Neville
I demand a meaning of all this
It's blood on his stick
I was attacked by these men for no openly reason
He had it with him last night in my house
In Heavens Name what does this mean then?
That was I want to know
Silence,let us proceed in order
As for the blood,your Worship
We preached him an ??? and
 he gave us as good as he got
There,the blood explained and everything else will be
Neville
Mr Landless,where is Edwin?
Edwin?
Isn't he at home?
What have you done with Ned?
When did you last see him,my boy
We went down to the river to watch the storm
-Yes?
-Yes
We said goodnight at
 a fork on the road
Which way did Edwin go?
The one that bears to his Uncle's
Why did you run away?
I didn't run away,why should I run away?
What are you trying to insinuate against my brother?
Let us proceed in order
Now,Sir,why did you leave Cloisterham in
 a wind like this for a walking tour
An excellent question,Mr Sapsea
Why did you?
I wanted to see the country
-Very suspicious
-May I?
-Ask him a question ,Your Honour?
-Quite
Mr Neville,in my presence a few nights ago did you or did you not rise a knife against Ned?
I did
A knife
Mmmm... most un-English!
But last night we made up our quarrel,we parted friends
What was your quarrel about?
That I shan't tell you
The case has a dark look
I have a mind to get out a warrant and commit him to jail under grave suspicions
You can't get out a warrant without evidence but I will hold myself responsible to produce Mr Landless if required
Why should Ned have disappeared
Is it likely he returned to the
 river alone and was drowned
We will search the river
You will leave this ?? to help us find Edwin,Mr Landless
Gladly
Mr Jasper is out of his mind with distress
Miss Bud is right
In my distracted state of mind
I have been hasty
Mr Neville must have an opportunity to prove his innocence
At least he can show us the spot where he
Parted from my poor boy last night
Let us go
Come Neville
Thank you for your trust in me
I understand why you went away,Helena told me
For the same reason I'll spare no effort to find the man you love
There he is
All right as soon as we get them hot drink in we'll push on again
He could take us to the right spot if he would
If you ask him perhaps he'll stay for something to eat
Neville
-Come to the fire you're wet and cold
-I don't mind that
There's nothing else to mind
As long as you believe in me
We all believe in you
Except Mr Jasper
Rosa,what did you think happened?
I daren't think
That's why we got to go on searching him
I found something
What is it,Crisparkle
Look what we found
Ned,his
He's dead
My boy is dead
Who is it?
I can't see anyone
It's Mr Grewgious,????,Sir
Let him come in
This is strange news
Strange and fearful news
How is Miss Rosa?
You imagine her condition
Have you seen his sister?
Whose?
The suspected young man
Do you suspect him?
-I can't make up my mind
-Nor I
But you spoke of him as the suspected young man
I thought you had made up your mind
Mr Jasper
I have a communication to make that will surprise you
At least it surprised me
What is it?
I might you guess sooner but it never occurred to me
What is it?
Your nephew was my ward
Although so long betrothed and
 so near to be married
Made up their minds only yesterday
That they were not meant to be husband and wife
Not
They broke their engagement and parted firmly on the evening when you last saw them together
Miss Rosa can I show Mr Jasper out here?
Why? Why did you say I was in
Well,Miss,seeing the other young ladies have all gone to the picnic and you so lonesome like I thought
I have been waiting for sometime to be summoned back to my duty near you
Didn't you forget them
The duty of teaching you music
I have left off that study
Not left off,discontinue
I'm resolved to leave off
Dearest Rosa
Charming Rosa
I do not wish to hear you
We cannot always do as we
 wish without harming others
I do not forget how many windows
 command a view of us
I will not touch you again
Sit down
My beloved
There will be no mighty wonder in your music-master's leaning idly on a sundial
In talking brief
Rosa
Even when my dear Edwin
 was a fiancée to you,I loved you
In the distasteful work of the day or wandering from the paradises and hell into which I rushed carrying your image
I loved you madly
As the ties with me my deer boy been less strong
I might have swept even him from your side
What do you mean?
Judge for yourself whether I shall allow another man to love you
I have devoted myself to discovering Edwin's murderer
I have worked patiently to widen the net around him
It is slowly,winding as I speak
I know Mr Landless is innocent
Circumstantial evidence will accumulate so strong,lady, even against an innocent
 man that it may slay him
So
You're clear enough
Rosa,I give you my fidelity to my dear dead boy
I give you my vengeance,my peace,my despair if only you will give me yourself and in exchange I give you 
Neville Landless life because I love you,I love you,I love you
Never,never
Neville
Oh Neville I'm afraid
-You're trembling
-You're in danger
Who frightened you like this?
Jasper said if I refused his love, he'll send you the gallows
And you came to warn me
To save me,why?
-Why?
-Because I love you
In your??that??
Yes,but tell me
I couldn't speak because Edwin was here
No I mustn't because he doesn't hear
Our engagement was broken
Broken?
I was going to tell you at Christmas
Edwin knew that you and I loved each other,he was going to give you the ring
What ring?
My mother's ring
He took it with him to his death
The death I'm supposed to have caused
Don't say that
Everybody thinks so
But you and I know it isn't true
You and I can't fight the whole world
Why not?
I wouldn't let you share my humiliation
Everywhere I go people whispering behind my back
"There goes the murderer of Edwin Drood"
Oh my dear
Rosa,I'm going away
But that will seem like
 a confession of guilt
Trust me it's for the best
If I go Jasper will have no hold over you
But you'll come back
Not until I've been able to prove to the whole world that I didn't kill Edwin Drood
Mr Sapsea,there's been a miscarriage of justice!
Impossible. I've never left my desk
Mr Mayor,I promised to produce Neville 
Landless,remember he was wanted
I'm therefore bound in honour to inform you he has left my house without
 a word to anyone
When did he leave?
When we went in to call him this
 morning his bed had not been disturbed
It's a confession of his guilt
The Law has permitted a murderer to escape
The Law can do nothing without a corpus delicti
Then you still propose to do nothing?
Do nothing! I shall allow him
??? I shall notify London
I shall bring this fellow Landless back in chains held as a material witness
Most quiet room you'll find Mr Mr
Datchery
Mr Datchery
From the eyes of bishop's palace
 but you'll have a fine view
-Good Morning
-Mrs Tope
That's Mr Jasper
Him with the tragedy
-And it'll be 40 shillings a month
-That's all
Of course you heard how 
Drood was made away with
So many people are constantly making a way with so many other
Depot 20 shilling in advance
Thank you
That's Mr Jasper playing ???
All he has in life is music
And tracking down his nephew's
 murderer,an ?? sworn to death
Are you alone?
Alone deary
Why if you Mr Roorich
Well you show surprise
You kept away a long time
You're in mourning too,why didn't you come for a little bit of comfort
Or did they leave you money so you didn't want no comfort
Hurry will you
Who was that it has died,deary?
A relative
Died of what,???
Death
Short and snappy ??
For want of a little???
Hurry,please
?? all over doesn't it, deary
We ought to have forgetfulnesses,we will
You learned your lesson in London very well
You make a most convincing old gentleman Mr Datchery
I must be convincing
It's my only hope to clear myself
I discovered these in a secret place in his room
I never had much power of deduction but
 these undoubtedly prove Mr Jasper to be
As I have surmised
An addict to some drug
You buy and return where from?
As a straightforward man 
I'm used to plotting
I would suggest that you keep them
Mr Grewgious,you claim that you're cold and dense but you helped and heartened me as only a true friend could
Nonsense I'm a hard man I hate
 to see the wrong man hanged
If he isn't it'll be thanks to you
What do you make of that?
A wax mould
Now if I were imaginative
Which of course I'm not
I'd say that someone have been trying to
 get into some place that he shouldn't
This key must be heavy enough to
To open a tomb
Pleasant dreams,deary
Over and over again
All of it again
All over again
Always in the same way
Always in the same way
Hundred of thousands of times I've done it
It's to be hoped it was pleasant to do
It was
Pleasant to do
So often I'd done it
But when it was really done
It seemed not worth for doing
It was done so soon
So soon
Ned
Ned
Ned
Ned
Oh my boy
My boy
Why didn't you kill me
Why?
Rosa
Rosa
You do anything to get how are you keep talking about,wouldn't you?
Rosa
She's mine
She's mine
No one shall have her but me
What was I doing?
Strangling me you was,you can't go round
 strangling people without paying for it
There's silver
Silver
And you're paying the gentlemen ?????
Quiet
I'll not be shut twice with???
I'll not be shut twice
Edwin Drood
Edwin
Ned
John Jasper
200 pounds
Mr there
Mr Roorich
Are you looking for anybody?
I've come to find Mr Roorich
There is no Mr Roorich
What are you giving me
I've just seen him come in
That was Mr Jasper
He who offers the reward?
The same
Roorich Jasper
Then it's Jasper that I come to see
Has he a calling, good gentleman?
Calling? Yes he was in the Choir
-In the spire?
-In the Cathedral
With a bishop over it
A dean
I'm mighty dean what might be interested to know
Yes
Nothing,deary
If you want to see Mr Jasper now
Here the stairways to his room
You don't want to see Mr Jasper now
No I changed me mind
Help a poor old woman,dear gentleman
Help a poor soul
What's coupled with a grievous cough
It was here in Cloisterham
A young gentleman gave me 3 and 6, I wanted
 the money to lay out on some medicines
What medicines?
Something that makes you forget
It was last Christmas Eve just after dark
Once when I was here before
That young gentleman give me the 3 and 6
An the young gentleman's name was Jack
And I told him it's better than Ned
Because Ned
It's a freaking name
Do you know that
A guinea,a golden guinea
All of them ?? as golden
If you wait in here for 5 minutes
No,no don't hurry me through the public streets it's not my personal dignity, the dignity of my office as mayor
Haven't we'd better send for Mr Jasper
Later,later the representative of the Queen's Authority
Should hear her first
Queen's? Oh,yes,yes,yes of course the Queen's authority
Look
It's shall all be done in order
Let nothing be touched
Mrs Tope no emotions
Tope sum the Coroner
-What's happened here?
-Dead,dead
Who is she?
She came here asking for you
For me?
I don't know her
She said that she knew something
 about Edwin Drood
About Ned?
Ned
My nephew
That explains why she asked for me
-Did she tell you anything?
-No
One thing at a time
Law must determine how this woman died
There's blood on the ??
She was killed,when she came in
She must had a seizure and
 struck her head there
I had myself reached that conclusion
The coroner,Sir
An accident Mr Coroner,I have determined the cause
You'll ascertain the identity of this poor creature
Those ?,please,? you can't come in here
Can't come in here
I'll bet Mr Jasper done her in
Arrest that brat
Widdy widdy wen!
He threw a stone at me
 once,and I punished him
Yes,yes,of course
Come here
Don't you try to attack me
See that six pence
Come now
What made you tell that lie about Mr Jasper
As he tried to choke me once,murder on his face
Why?
Because one night him and 
Durdles come out of the Cathedral
Way down they was in the cellars
Hours and hours
I waited for them and he said I was spying on him
When was this?
I don't know
I know that it occurred before the great storm
-You know Mr Durdles
-Do I know him?
I stole the????
You take me to him now
 and I'll give you one shilling
Come on then
Widdy widdy wen!
You owe me a tuppence
I do not
Who's been saying ???
Hello,who are you?
I've been told that Mr Durdles knows more than the Dean about the fine Norman
 crypts in your cathedral
You are another of them Antiquarians?
Could you take me down in those crypts tonight?
I take any gentleman
 that brings liquor for two
Or even liquor for one
I'll bring it along about 10
Why anyone shall go down amongst the dead ones at night,beats Durdles
Weary that lime Datchery
By your foot
It's gone that's weird
Durdles has not done any work down here since that lime was brought down
Mr Jasper gave me the bottle beforehand
That's for??
Only one of it's kind
Mr Jasper gave me the bottle beforehand
Let's go on
That's were I slipped when 
I showed Mr Jasper around
I had a?? then
Did you sleep long
Long enough to dream
It seems could hear Mr Jaspers footsteps going through them gates
Why shouldn't he?
How could he go through the gates who was locked when Durdles has the only key?
We are in heavenly dreams,tell me
Durdles,tell me is it true that you can tell by the sound of your hammer where dead are buried?
Durdles will show you
Some of them older in them was some ??
Listen
Sorry
Why should some tombs be empty?
???by Richard 3 in the War
 of the Roses,I've heard
Now this is an empty one
Now you listen to the difference in the sound
Sounds the same to me?
It was empty
Durdles told Mr Jasper so
Durdles makes never mistakes
It's fresh plaster
Give me your hammer
That's strike with ??
Go to the Mayor's house,bring 
Mr Sapsea here and Mr Brudles
And Mr Crisparkle tell them to hurry
What's this all about
Tell them I think I found
Edwin Drood
Why are you opening this tomb?
If it contains what I think it does
The murderer of Edwin Drood is found
You know where Neville Landless is?
I do
Then why not produce him and you shall have the reward whether
 you find Edwin Brood or not
But you see Mr Jasper Neville 
Landless did not kill Edwin Drood
This way
-Very strange
-Almost unimaginable
-It's Mr Jasper
-Neville
I found him here,arrest this man
What does this mean you being found here
Look in that tomb
Just a few bones
Quick you must ????
The identification is impossible
I venture to disagree
I gave this ring to Mr Drood
The day he disappeared
Just before his engagement
 to Miss Rosa was broken
You remember Mr Jasper
Landless came back here to get the ring
Durdles and the boy Deputy will be the chief witnesses against the murderer of Edwin Drood
Them footsteps no dream
Them spirits??
The quick-lime,you used it
The tomb empty,you filled it
He's locked it
Arrest that man
Sound the alarm
Ned
What have I done,what have I done
What have I done
So soon
Rosa
The journey is made
Rosa
Mrs Landless

Silence!
Because he really is, as we mentioned,
the orchestra leader who must conduct all those working under him
to produce a coherent, harmonious concert.
Once his collaborators understood
his intention and what he wanted,
what he believed would make the most consistent statement,
then he gave them free rein.
But they had to understand his approach completely before that would happen.
At the end of the script, the village doctor, the vampire's accomplice... was to flee the village.
In the middle of a marsh he was to fall into a mire where, unable to save himself, he would lose his life.
One day we set out to find a suitable mire, and we drove around looking at marshes.
But we discovered a house by the road where strange white shadows danced around the windows and doors as though some white fire inside was throwing off clear flames through the openings and cracks.
We couldn't resist.
We had to explore that white fire.
We went inside and saw some dark silhouettes walking around a grindstone, making plaster of Paris.
The air was thick with fine powder.
When we saw that, we knew what our style had to be: black silhouettes against a white background.
So we had to think of the ending taking place inside a white mill.
We knew then how the doctor should die:
He'd be suffocated under an endless stream of milled flour.
We had planned on a rather heavy style, but by chance we discovered something much better, so we changed our plans.
Examining the first rushes... we stopped at a scene that seemed to have been shot in fog, a muddle of grayish white.
To us this was the solution, at least for the interiors.
NIGHTSTICKS AT VIENNESE THEATER
SCANDAL AT SCREENING OF VAMPYR
But the dogs!
There are no children or dogs here!
THE Old Dark House
Damn!
Why did you stop?
Stop for a break.
Philip, can not stop here. God, continues or reverses.
You do not expect overnight like a rat in a sewer.
For best stop we drive through the gorge under these conditions, right?
Well, losing your temper is not going to help.
I've never been so calm in my life.
I love driving one hundred miles in the dark with little light.
I love to feel the icy water dripping on my neck.
It is one of the happiest moments of my life.
Want me to drive for a while?
Yes, it is exactly what I was expecting.
Oh, I will not be quiet until we come to Shrewsbury.
That if we Shrewsbury.
Any idea where we are? I have not the faintest idea.
That relieves me.
All right, Penderel?
All right. Where are we?
We do not know. We got lost. We are somewhere in the Welsh mountains ...
Are ... half past nine, and I'm sorry. Do not say that
Ten to one that did not get to Shrewsbury tonight.
You never know.
& Quot; Oh, Mister Waverton, what will become of me? & Quot;
& Quot; wanted to go to Shrewsbury but I was brought here. & Quot;
In reality, given the choice ...
I'm ... not sure he wanted to go to Shrewsbury.
Moreover, I do not really want to go anywhere.
Here something interesting could happen, nothing ever happens in Shrewsbury.
Of course we could pass something.
I could tell you something we might happen.
I would not want to scare Miss. Waverton Go ahead, Mr. Penderel ...
I do not scare me ... -¿Ud easily. no? Well, I have.
Well, just wanted to say ...
... We'll have a little care ...
Do not stop!
How do you want to avoid to stop? Think you're going by boat?
& Quot; Trapped in the night! Trapped in the night! Caught ...
-¡Sr. Penderel, please! Excuse me.
Do you think we will get? I do not know.
Bon Voyage.
God, for a moment! Look at the map.
From what I can see, we are not in the map.
Look, Philip, you can not see anything. It's all a stupid puddle.
This place seems staged to perfection. Everything is flooded.
You keep driving. Arrive somewhere some time.
I guess that's all we can do.
& Quot; Singing in the bathtub, singing in the rain & quot; ...
Look, Phil! Lights! Lights! Let us go there.
It would be more reasonable to move forward. Well I vote for staying here.
Thus far we have come. Probably has come off the top of the hill.
& Quot; Anybody there ?, the traveler said. & Quot;
Called again, louder.
I would have thought that was enough to wake the dead.
What a idea. Which one?
Would not that be awesome? Imagine that the inhabitants were dead ...
Rigid ... under the penumbra of the lamps.
It sure would be very exciting.
What would be more a drink.
If we have to be soaked, pregnant better inside than outside.
'Listen. -¿El What?
I thought I heard something.
Good night. We have come to ask for shelter. We got lost.
We are completely cut off.
Do you understand? We can not continue or return.
The road was closed in both directions. Landslides.
Neither sounds like Welsh.
My name is Femm. Horace Femm.
How are you? Sorry to break into your home in this way.
My name Waverton. I present to my wife.
How are you?
Penderel!
-lovely Sure. How are you?
Why do not you sit down?
Thank you.
My sister was arranging these flowers.
I do not know if your servant has explained our situation.
He did the best he could, but I'm afraid I could not understand.
Morgan is dumb.
Oh, sorry. I had not noticed.
We saw the lights in your house and wonder if they would be kind enough to stay tonight.
As you see it is impossible to continue. I understand. Embarrassing. Very embarrassing.
What is it? What do they want?
Let me introduce you to my sister, Rebecca Femm.
How are you?
Why are you here?
What do they want?
How are you?
What do they say? What do they want?
Why are you here? What will this fuss? What the ...?
Excuse my sister. It's a little deaf. Well, sometimes quite deaf.
They want to know if they can stay the night. Shelter. Les has caught the storm.
Of course it can not be! They can not be here!
Forward ...
There has been an evolution. It seems that mid-mountain has collapsed.
This has forced us to stop.
The road is blocked behind us and maybe it will be later.
We do not want to intrude, but what else can we do?
There is nowhere else to go. The road is flooded, and for this reason this place can be flooded or buried.
What happens?
Did you hear what he said?
There are landslides and floods. The lake has overflowed.
We are trapped. We are trapped. We must go. Do you hear? We have to go.
Afraid, Horace. You're scared, right?
Do not believe in God and now you are afraid to die.
You've seen his anger in the sky and you've heard in the night. And now you're afraid.
Fear. Fear. Where are your jokes now? Now you can be afraid. Your time will come.
But not now. This home is safe. I know better than you. Morgan!
Do you remember the years of the great storms when we were cut off?
There were landslides and floods. And no roads disappeared?
Morgan remembers. She says this house is safe. Because it is built on rock.
They will have to stay. Adversity is His, not ours.
No beds! They can not have beds!
As my sister insinuates, I am afraid there are no beds.
Enough. If we can sit by the fire will suffice.
Course. I'm not sure I want to sleep tonight.
Morgan will keep the fire alive.
Is there somewhere you can protect the car from the rain?
There are stables behind the house. Morgan chaperone.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to go out and bring the suitcases. Well.
No beds! They can not have beds!
-¡Vaya Storm! -Of Good we got rid.
Hope you're right, this house gives me the creeps, not to mention its inhabitants.
It's still better than driving by invisible roads.
At least there is a roof and a bonfire.
And now, Mr. Penderel, will accompany me with a drink?
Mr. Femm obviously I'll join you.
Is gin alone, you know? Only gin. I like gin.
Miss. Waverton?
Thank you very much.
Mr. Penderel, drink to something that does not appreciate you. Still so young.
I drink to the illusion!
Illusion? Oh! I'm at the best age to drink to that, Mr. Femm.
I guess you are one of those gentlemen, shall we say, hardened by war?
Right, Mr. Femm. War generation, dirty, bitter, forgotten, and this, Mr. Femm, is an excellent gin.
A horrible night. Looks set to worsen.
Yes, it is fascinating and bad. But certainly not in any danger here.
His sister left him quite clear.
But assuming that we stay in solitary confinement, locked up here ...
Well, it would be a hassle for you. Having stayed.
But it's terrible. How can you be so calm? Seems not to understand.
We may be incommunicado. Enclosed in this house!
I'm afraid I'm a little nervous. I am a very nervous man.
But the fact is that Morgan is an animal. Sometimes he drinks too much.
A night like this could induce him to drink, and once you're drunk, it's really dangerous.
I do not want to alarm you, Miss. Waverton, but do not know what we should do.
Well I know what I'll do. That if Mrs. Femm let me.
What?
I am very wet and would be very grateful if you could change clothes.
What?
I was wondering if I could change.
Appears wet. You better go. To change.
Thank you. Good idea. Is there any room or something?
A dreadful night.
What?
I mean making a dreadful night.
Yes, an old house. Very old.
Very kind of you to let us stay. 'What?
I say it's you. Really friendly!
Yes, it makes a dreadful night. I'm a little deaf.
I understand.
Yes. No beds!
Not have these electric lights. Neither have.
Thank you very much. Now I can fix myself.
My sister Rachel had once this room. He died at age 21.
She was a naughty.
Graceful and wild as a hawk. All young people were after him.
With her red lips, her eyes wide and her white neck. But that did not save her.
He fell from his horse during a hunt. Spine was damaged.
He remained in this bed ... month after month.
I spent a lot of time sitting here and listening to screaming.
What horror.
I used to beg ... to kill her. He had said that out to the Lord.
But he did not. It was wicked through.
Well, I better change.
Here are all wicked. They used to bring their women.
Brazen, lolling creatures in silks and satins.
They filled the house with laughter and sin, laughter and sin.
If I ever was present, my own father and brothers told me to go to pray.
They would not tell Rachel to leave to pray. And I prayed!
I left them with their lustful women pale and rosy. My father still lives.
He's upstairs. It is very old.
Yeah?
It has 102 years.
That's a lot, right?
It's an old infamous and blasphemous.
You are also immoral. Young and graceful. Foolish and immoral.
Do not think about anything except your long slim legs your white body and how to please your husband.
You will rejoice in the pleasures of carnal love, right?
That's fine, but will rot.
That is still great. But over time, it will also rot.
No! How dare you?
Sassy ..., lolling creatures silk and satin ... laughter and laughter and sin ... sin ... lustful women and pale rosy ...
Philip!
Two thumbs up for you., Miss. Waverton. Makes feel like a party.
Thank you.
They must have thought I have been slow.
In fact, I think you've been faster than usual.
I thought it took too long.
A dinner!
Philip.
Horace! What are you doing? We are not pagans.
I had forgotten the strange tribal habits my sister.
The beef will be more tender if bless.
Horace Femm. Although you can not hear, I can see. You are blaspheming.
On the contrary, dear Rebecca.
Just tell them your guests intrigued ...
You were ... about to thank your gods for their generosity ...
Sure. I know that false and mocking tone.
And ... give thanks for health, prosperity and happiness given to this family.
During these years of peace and plenty.
Giving thanks for bringing the world to Rebecca Femm. And Femm Roderick. And Saul.
Enough!
Lord bless this food ... amen.
Take a potato.
Thank you.
Well, this seems to be more than a storm.
Yes, is not it?
Take a potato.
Thank you. I love a potato.
¿Vinegar, Miss Femm?
He's just pouring.
Thank you, Mrs. Waverton. I've been looking for this phrase all night.
Onion no thanks.
Those lights. They are flashing. I guess it's the storm.
Contrary. We generate our own electricity but I think we are not very good.
I hope you all do not panic if the power goes out.
Is anybody out.
You can not go!
Should enter. Surely it is dangerous to be outside right now.
Must be half drowned. We should not make them wait long.
No, I'm afraid we must let them enter.
Morgan, opens the door.
Come on, Morgan. Let them pass.
What a night!
Never thought we would open the door.
They have cracked the dam or something.
Anyway, before I knew not where we were, something we have fallen ...
And ... has crushed the car.
Lucky has not crushed us.
And by the way, probably the current drag this house.
Look at this!
Go fire.
Sorry for barging in this way so rude, but the force needs if you are in the hands of the devil.
Well, who is the owner?
My sister owns. Ms.. Femm.
How are you, Mrs.. Femm?
My name Porterhouse. Sir William Porterhouse
And this lady is Mrs.. Gladys Ducane, a friend of mine.
Nice to meet you. Great weather for ducks.
Let me introduce you. This is Miss. Waverton.
How are you?
'Mr Penderel. How are you, Sir William?
And Mr. Waverton. How are you?
Sir William Porterhouse.
How are you?
I have not seen a night like this in my life.
I'd say it's raining cats and dogs.
We were soaked, I do not mind telling you.
Would not surprise me that we were at the gates of death.
Better not come back to get wet shoes ... or, as Sir William points, will surely be at the gates of death.
Here you go. They are not exactly measure but dry.
Thank you. It's okay.
Are you. Fond of opera, Monsieur?
Let's eat.
Oh! Now I hear.
Morgan, brings chairs.
Oh, oh! Roast beef!
Nothing like a roast beef for a hungry man.
& Quot; Oh, the roast beef of Old England & quot; ... How was it?
Do not remember it, Mister Waverton, or is older than you.?
-Penderel Is our expert songs. Then he must be a musician, right?
Well, I have heard little.
Take a potato.
Morgan brings a glass of water to Sir William.
Thank you very much.
Us ... look, for example.
We here six people sitting together,
We spent nearly two hours talking ...
Something ... and we know each other? Nothing.
How comforting.
I agree Sir William. At best, only make assumptions.
If you were a woman, do not just assumptions.
Ah! The famous female intuition.
Have you ever been told which horse will win the race?
No. But tell me a lot about you.
I wonder, Miss. Waverton,
As much as to say that I'm wanted by the police?
Oh, no, Mr. Femm not say anything so romantic.
After all, it is conceivable that someone living in a house like this ...
If you had to ...?
Well, there's no accounting for taste.
No.
-¿Sra. DuCane? Yes?
What does your intuition tell you about me?
Pretty.
Hmm ... That scares me a lot.
What do you say?
I said ... well, either way is not very interesting.
Oh yes it is. We want to know. Well ... it sounds silly but ...
I think ... not suited to these times ...
You know ...? Factories, misleading advertising, underground economy ...
... Well, what I mean is that Bill is happy with this ...
Make you feel ... but Mr. Penderel like a fish out of water.
Should be flattered, Mr. Penderel.
No, I do not feel flattered.
Look, I have little sympathy for the fish out of water if only one of them.
My problem is I do not think much about the important things.
Now Sir William would put great effort into anything to earn a few pounds.
I do not think it worthwhile.
No doubt you must think I'm very ambitious, friend.
But maybe I can see things a bit further than assumed.
His good speech, but I know as well as everyone here ...
Just trying ... to provoke me.
Honestly, I was not doing anything.
I envy. I admire.
Oh, yes, envy me, fine. But not admire me.
Well, I ... I do not admire me. I know that not everyone is making money.
But let me tell you something. I am a young man, see? ...
Married ... with a girl from Manchester, beautiful as anyone, the only thing in the world that matters me ...
... It dies. It was. My bosses give a party. We invite ...
... A very special day for us. I bought my first suit ...
Lucy ... and has a new dress. A cotton dress ...
Lucy ... it seems that was not very well at the party, especially among women, despised. Nothing concrete, you know ...
Just ... thought the dress was not very good. Lucy is concerned ...
You ... into his head that his guilt will not be successful ...
... Well, you can not believe it but I know that's what killed her.
That's what I did to start making money.
I swore I would kill those guys and their wives, they had neither a kind word for Lucy.
And I was crushed. At least the majority.
Once you've started making money, you can not stop ...
... Especially if you're like me, you're not good at anything else.
But we do not know what Gladys has to be better than us. Mrs.. Ducane ...
... Why not tell them your real name?
My real name ... is Perkins.
A pretty name.
I can be this or that, but I can not pretend to be what I'm not.
I think it's you. Still a little offensive.
Let Mr. Penderel. I can take care of myself.
If I do not do it now, I can not do it anymore.
I was not trying to say anything for you, Bill ...
Not pretend to be ... what I'm not. I'm not that stupid for that.
These people recognize one when they see a showgirl ...
... And, by the way, not very good.
If I were better at my job, I would not be spending the weekend with you.
No. I take it back. Also I would.
You are kind. We're good, but ...
Morgan is drinking. I knew this night would begin.
'Where's he get? -From me there. Can not you stop him?
It is now in the kitchen, drunk. Pretty drunk.
Who is Morgan? Is the guy who served us the table?
Yes. ... Morgan is the butler.
He looks at me as if I were to take hair.
Hello.
Hello.
Well? Have you come to help me see God's wrath?
No. I come to thank him on my side.
It has been an honor, Mrs.. Ducane.
Perkins for you.
Thank you, Perkins.
Pawn this old mansion for a drink.
Hmm ... and me.
And we will succeed! I have some whiskey in the car. I forgot.
Wait here and go for it. No, I'll go with you.
Better stay here under cover.
The car is in the stables and will soak.
Okay, but not late.
¿Mr. Penderel?
Hello. Why are you here? It was becoming.
I've come to find.
Hey, hey. What is it? What happened?
Nothing. In fact, nothing. I'm a little scared, that's all.
Someone closed the door in my face.
It must have been the wind. Not. I know what is the wind.
It is quiet, but he could lie down.
Yes, sure. Well, what you want is a drink of this.
Thank you.
I'm feeling a little more human.
This looks like a family reunion.
He's right.
Look at this.
Come on, take them out.
It seems I've spent most of the afternoon changing his shoes.
It should have been a nurse.
Yeah, only good nurses do not drink whiskey bottle.
The storm is worse than never, right?
Worst.
It had to happen. Gone is the light.
I think now it's gone completely. Overnight at twilight.
Okay, but surely there are some sailing somewhere.
Can I do something with lights, Mrs.. Femm?
No. Nobody understands our system except Morgan.
And as an electrician, Morgan moment is not qualified.
Why not you got a light?
No. We have no lamp.
What did he say? Nothing, nothing major.
No? Nothing important? It turns out that this time I heard.
They want a lamp.
Give them big. Has fuel. We used the last time the power went out.
Come on, Horace. You know what it is.
I do not know where he is. You could go you, Rebecca.
It's too big for me. If you do not know where I'll tell you.
You know as well as I do. It is on the small table on the top floor.
Do you know where the top floor, Horace?
At least you will know that there is a top floor. Oh, but you're so incredulous.
He's up, Horace. Top. Below the roof.
Yes, of course. I remember now. But I think it is a bit heavy for me.
I do not think the can down the stairs.
Why not say what happens, Horace? It happens that you're afraid to ride alone.
Go with it. Tenga. I do not know why I bother ...
Well ... we'd be sitting in the dark.
Better to go up, right? Yes. I guess so.
It will not take.
Very well. Miss. Waverton should not worry about me nervous.
You. Would be a better guide.
This is my room.
Yeah?
There are a couple of things that I think would like to see.
I sure would like a lot. But it taught me another time.
We have to find the lamp. Yes.
Hey, why should we bother to fetch the lamp?
We could wait here a few minutes, and say that we have found. Or it's broken.
I find no reason.
Yes, but why should we care so much about the lamp if you do not want?
We have said that the head down, why we were not going to do?
Yes, but why should we do if we want? I do not want.
This is absurd.
Did you hear that?
I heard something.
What was it?
Was it Morgan. It is drunk. You will be making a fuss down the kitchen.
I thought the noise came from above. Anyway, are we on the lamp?
I wonder if I excuse not to come with you. I'm not very strong.
There are many steps. I should have said before, but you know, love itself ...
You will find it above the small table at the end of the landing two floor up.
I guess it's not too heavy to lower myself.
Oh, not at all. In fact it is fairly light.
I see.
Thank you, thank you very much.
You. Has opened, right? Well now you go and close it. We will close it. I can not.
Going to close what?
The rain is coming. The flood is rising.
We will all get wet if it is not fast.
It refers to the window of his room. I think I've opened.
Come on. You've opened. You can shut.
Okay, Ms.. Femm. I'm going to close it.
Mr. Penderel! Mrs.. DuCane!
Mr. Penderel! Mrs.. DuCane!
Is Morgan. It is there, at the foot of the stairs.
Take the candle. Stay there.
Go away! Get out of here!
Is he dead? No, I see him breathing from here.
It is only stunned.
You will be awake in a minute, but it sure will fall asleep. It is very drunk.
Oh, Philip, this house is horrible.
Is not it very nice, no?
Listen, Margaret, something is going up.
Oh, Philip. No more horrors.
No, this is not horror. It was a voice calling behind a door.
A faint voice, like a child. I think I should go and see what happens.
You'll have to come with me. I never want to leave you alone.
Morgan will be fine. Give me your hand, darling.
Oh, Philip. 'What is it? Sit a while dear.
Thank you.
It Well, what happened then? Then the war ended.
What happened to the girl? 'Oh, the girl I left forgotten?
'The girl I was in love. 'The reason is that she married, Gladys.
What a bitch.
No, on the contrary, a girl of good reputation. Now, let's talk about you.
I know what I will say. I was going to ask Bill Porterhouse.
Very ready, Mrs.. Perkins.
I do not mind telling you. Rather I prefer. Bill is fine, really.
Obviously not love him. And of course, gives me money.
Not much, but enough to keep me.
You probably will not believe me, but no ... Bill does not expect anything from me.
Do you understand what I mean by & quot, & quot ;? nothing
. Yeah I understand what you mean & quot, & quot ;. nothing
You like people to think it's effeminate.
With all the money you have, it is very lonely.
Yeah, I figured when I heard the story of the cotton coat.
I think that is still in love with his former wife.
I'm sure. I guess the only thing is that I want to keep him company.
He likes to sit at night in my bed and brag ...
Things ... he has done during the day.
Well, that's pretty harmless. Look, do not pretend to be better than I am.
You.'s A lovely creature, right?
I like it, terribly.
And you to me.
'What are you thinking? -ud. should not be too satisfied.
Dare.
I was thinking that I'd like to pretend I'm your lover ... and you.'s mine, Gladys, body and soul.
I would take her in my arms and hold strong.
I too would like.
Would he, Gladys Perkins? If so, then, leave it's pretend.
I heard. Gladys Perkins has an idea. I think he has gone mad.
She ... she ... she wants to live with you. Oh, I'm throwing her arms.
I had the crazy idea that should help you become a useful person.
Dear, Perkins ...
Do you think I'm crazy?
Pretty crazy, dear. And I thank God for it.
So what are you saying?
This is what I say, dear Perkins.
But I have better than his idea.
What is?
Is this ...
No, I will not tell here. Here is magic.
I'll tell you later at home, perhaps with the first rays of dawn.
Tell me now.
Come, let us return to the house. No! No, let's stay here.
It is cold.
No. It's the idea of ​​returning to the house which makes me shiver.
I have the feeling that something terrible might happen to us if we return to the house.
Perkins, Perkins. You have my iron arm, right?
It's okay. Come on.
No, these shoes are not so wet place. I'll try to carry her.
Weight as a demon.
Well, if you weigh too much for me, I'll throw the mud and go on alone.
Hello. Where were they?
I went to the car for something to drink.
And I went with him.
Is wet feet.
Oh, have you wet your feet? Yes, got wet feet.
Well, what the hell is going on here?
I do not know what the hell is happening here or anywhere.
I went to the room from the old to close a window and came across this again.
Where are the others?
I do not know more than you. Mr. Waverton up with Mr. Femm find a lamp.
I guess his wife joined them. I've slept.
So you have wet feet?
Yes, Bill. But that's not all.
Yes, I thought so.
I do not know how you going to take, but ... well, I have to get it out from the inside.
Come on.
I fell in love, Bill.
Oh right, of course.
-¿De Him? Yes, him.
Damn stupid Maybe. But one does not choose these things.
Money does she have? 'Not a penny.
And you're going to go with it?
Yes, Bill. Are you mad?
I think you're a lunatic. But I'm not angry.
Took'm pretty good, no, Perkins? 'I told you. To Bill all good.
I can see that.
I wonder where the other may be.
Listen, Bill. She has not told her everything.
Oh, no? Why?
Because she does not know everything. We're getting married.
Oh yeah?
At the end she will have me. I'll ask tomorrow, with the first rays of dawn.
Will you come to the wedding?
I think he's sick in the head.
Really?
No, not really.
I think today will have been probably the best working day of his life.
Ah, Bill, Bill ...
Who said you can call me Bill?
Well, try to avoid it.
Now, look at this, come here and do something useful by raising this table.
No way to find the roast beef.
Mrs.. Perkins, filetée roast beef.
Filetéalo yourself.
Are you sure you feeling better?
Yes, I'm fine.
Well, come on.
This is the door.
Who are you.?
I'm Miss. Waverton. He is my husband. Are you. Mr. Roderick Femm?
We came because we believed hearing him call.
Can we do something for you?
Can you take it. Want it or give it?
I myself, thanks.
And now, what was that noise?
Was it ... Morgan? Yes.
Morgan is a savage. I ... I apologize.
But we must keep him here. They had it coming.
I'm sorry, really, but we could have helped.
Oh, I ... did not mean that. I was never inhospitable. Never.
This house was always full of people, some time ago.
When they came, what they told?
We told you. Was invalid.
Is that all?
Yes.
Have you seen my son Horace? And his sister Rebecca?
Yes.
And Morgan. I would tell you all about it ... but no time.
Look, when you're as old as I, at any moment, you can die.
Oh, please, do not talk if that fatigue.
This house is cursed. Two of my sons died at age 20.
And then ... spent more. Wine madness.
You see, we're all a little crazy. Except for me. At least, I ... I think not.
Want to sleep?
No. Not now. Look, it could be ...
Could what?
Dangerous.
Are you referring to Morgan?
No. Morgan no. I refer to my oldest son.
Saul.
Is this the Saul?
Have not spoken to Saul?
No, they did not.
Saul is the worst, you know? We have to monitor.
Because look, he wants ... he just wants to ... destroy, kill. Poor Saul.
Where is?
I know where it is. He's upstairs, behind the door chained, right?
Yes. Enclosed.
Saul is why we have to keep Morgan.
If there is no escape?
Saul probably set fire the house.
Already tried it once.
He said he wanted to make an offering of the house.
But are you sure locked, no?
Yes. But look, if Morgan is wrong, I ...
I think ... could ... open the door.
Philip. What if he comes back?
Wait here. I'll go down and will look on her.
It has risen above. I heard. You will drop to Saul.
Hope the foot of the stairs and kill him.
What should we do? Can we stay here?
No, what if would cause a fire? Come on.
And what about Sir Roderick?
Will block the door.
Sir Roderick, I'll lock him in here.
Asleep.
What is it?
There's a crazy up. Morgan has missed and dangerous.
We have to do something. 'Where are they now?
Top. But they can get off at any time.
Everything's fine, dear. I knew something terrible was going to happen.
Would not it be better to take away the middle? No, we can not do that.
You could burn the house down. Already tried it once.
Well, let. Let this old corrupt house burn. I hope so.
That's fine, but what about the Femm?
What is it?
His brother has escaped from the room.
Who? Is this the Saul?
Look.
Stay back.
Do it backwards, Morgan! Do you hear me? Do it back!
Take him to the kitchen!
Do it in!
Lock him in the kitchen!
The sins of our fathers. The sins of our fathers.
Come on! Come into my room!
No! I'm not moving from here.
Well here it is!
I think we will have problems.
Oh! Penderel!
Come on, come here.
No! I'm staying here.
Gladys, do something difficult come here. Margaret.
Oh, no. All right
Wait a minute.
Here, start this.
Oh, I love you so much. Just what I want.
Please. Please do not touch me.
Good! What is it?
Listen, I do not re-lock. Do not let me lock again.
I'm not crazy. I swear to God I'm not crazy.
And why would that shut him up?
I have fear. I know things about them. Years ago, killed his sister Rachel.
But I do not think counting! I promised I would never tell.
And they have remained here all this time for that?
And Morgan ... I assure you, it's the devil. Morgan hits me.
Do not leave me! Stay with me!
It's okay. Sit here and wait. Be right back.
The door is locked! Ms.. Femm must've closed.
It's locked, right? Yes.
That's better. Now, you can not stop me.
Listen, we have to go help the rest with Morgan.
Is there another way in?
No. There is no way ...
But there must be a back entrance to the house.
Freeze!
I want to tell a story.
Who's there? Nobody.
Friends of yours?
I tell you no one.
Do invite her out?
You ... You. Going to tell me something.
Yes, it is.
Do not ... I did not tell that story?
Yes. Shall we sit?
Yes, please.
Who is in that closet?
No one. Tell me what I was going to say.
Are you interested in the fire?
Of course ... of course yes. Yes, quite.
I have done a study on the fire.
Really? This seems very interesting.
Fire know things that no one else in the world knows.
And not me going to say? I would like to know.
Why's he going to say? You. Would not tell me who is inside that closet.
Yes I would say. Besides, you know, it would be unfair to arouse my curiosity ...
And at the end ... not tell me anything.
Want me to tell you all about fire, right?
Yes, I'm looking forward.
All right. First of all, I learned that llamas are like razors.
They are cool, man. Sharp and cold as snow, and hot as ice.
Oh. Certainly that's very ... very interesting.
So, really they are like razors, right? Well, continue.
Tell me what else has discovered.
Oh, lots of things. Dude, sit down.
So I thought I could fool me, right?
I thought I could leave me sitting here and not notice.
But as you can see, I am also ready. That's why we understand each other.
So he quickly realized that he wanted to kill.
We understand each other very well, eh, my friend?
Yes, yes, of course. From the start, for some reason ...
... You ... you. Pleased me and I ... I thought you liked me.
¿Please me? Dude, I do. Did you know that my name is Saul?
Saul, friend. And Saul loved David.
Yes, of course.
But Saul was afraid of David because the Lord was with him but had departed from Saul.
And sooner or later it had to happen that the spirit of evil from taking over Saul.
And he prophesied in the midst of the temple. And David played the harp with his hands.
And Saul had a spear in his hands.
And Saul threw the spear.
And he said, & quot; atravesaré her to David and stab you in the wall & quot ;.
And David left his sight twice. Twice friend ...
And ... the third ... the third time ... be careful.
Hey. I am your friend. I'm on your side. It would be foolish to miss. If I lose ...
Look! Is Morgan! He's come for you.! Morgan!
Freeze! Do not move!
Philip! Philip!
Oh, leave! Do not see it? There's Penderel!
Let me go with him. Come on let me. Go, let me pass.
Oh, you're a pig. But I'm not afraid. I go with him. Do you hear me?
Oh, how can?
Listen, I'm single, you hear me? I want to go with Penderel. It hurt.
Oh, how I can make you understand me? He was hurt.
I have to help him and the other man, Saul.
The two are injured.
Are you all right, Margaret? Yes, I'm fine, dear.
Gladys.
It's okay. Come on. Are you feeling better?
Yes, I'm not so bad.
What happened to them? It was Morgan. The hit.
Come on.
I'm all right. Where is Penderel? I have to heal.
Better not go there.
Come with me.
-¡Está Alive! 'What?
I tell them that is alive! He's alive!
Good Morning.
Good Morning.
Good morning, Mr. Waverton.
Good Morning.
The floods have come down considerably.
Thank the heavens for that.
I think they will now be possible to go by ambulance.
You mean we can go now?
Yes, sure we can go now. Come with me, dear.
-ud. are going to stay here with Gladys, right? Yes. Do not delay.
No, we'll go as fast as we can.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
Bye Bye. Nice to have met you.
So I'm dead and I have gone to heaven.
No, it's morning and we have just left behind hell.
-¿De Day? Yes. The rays of dawn.
Do not tell me you had to something with the first rays of dawn?
On second thought, there was something.
Perkins. Will you marry me?
End
How much farther?
Soon now.
Anyone else living round the old Norman place, besides Miss Lu?
Who?
That woman, the Creole who was with him when he died.
Do you know her?
Hmm.
Anyone else living there?
No people.
There it is.
Here.
Come back for me in two hours, hmm?
Uh-uh.
No more ride for you tonight.
Tomorrow.
But listen...
Oh.
How do you do,
Mr. Crosby?
How are you, Miss Lu?
Are the others here?
Not yet.
Clock's fast.
It stopped when the master died.
You let it remain just that way for 10 years?
Nothing has been changed here.
Everything is just as he left it.
He would've wanted it that way.
Yes, and everything will be the way he wanted it tonight.
We'll read his will in the library at midnight, just 10 years from the time he died.
But that's the end, Miss Lu. A dead man can't stop the clock forever.
There'll be a change from now on.
Yes.
You ought to be glad. It must've been rather lonely here all these years.
I'm never lonely.
I've got my friends.
Friends?
Yes, my friends!
From the other world.
There are always murmurs.
The house is full of murmurs.
They tell me things.
Oh, you believe in spirits, huh?
Well, have they told you that the heirs and I have to stay here all night?
I've prepared for it.
Some of them are coming now.
You've got sharp ears, Miss Lu.
Why, it's not at all involved.
We are second cousins once removed.
Our great aunt Elizabeth was very...
Well, how should I put it, very, uh...
Prolific?
Well, at any rate, she had a large family.
Twenty-nine.
Don't exaggerate, darling.
Thirty.
What are you talking about?
Crocodiles!
Alligators, to you.
Why did old man Norman want to live in this dismal place?
Well, of course, Cyrus was somewhat eccentric.
What you mean is plain cuckoo.
Young man, have you no respect for a dead relative?
None whatever, unless of course he happened to make me his sole heir.
I doubt that.
Cyrus always professed a great weakness for me.
Yeah, you said he was eccentric.
Say!
There it is, just as Mr. Norman put it there 10 years ago.
Exactly as he put it there.
Hello, this envelope has been tampered with.
Both of them.
Somebody must have opened the safe and read the will.
How could they? Nobody knows how to open the safe but you.
Well, I didn't do it.
You aren't suspicioning me, are you, Mr. Crosby?
Well, if anyone tried to change it, he wasted his time.
I made a duplicate of the will, at Mr. Norman's request, and put it in the vault of the
Trust Company in New Orleans.
Someone at the front door.
See who it is.
And mind you, say nothing about this.
Good evening.
So, you're still here.
Hello.
Wait.
Huh?
I know Miss Tilbury, and you,
Miss Cicily, but who are you?
Fred Blythe, one of the family.
You must be the old boy's housekeeper they talk about.
I was very devoted to Mr. Norman, which is more than his family can say.
Really?
I don't think I'm going to like it here.
Shh. Don't say a word.
Are we the first to arrive?
Lawyer Crosby is in the library.
What happened?
Sometimes they get into the machinery.
Sometimes who gets into the machinery, Aunt Sue?
How should I know?
Oh, so it's you,
Miss Tilbury. Cicily.
Evening, Fred.
Hello.
Excuse me.
Hello. Hello, Charlie, nice to see you again.
Thanks, Mr. Crosby.
Same here.
He's pretty, isn't he?
Does he belong to us?
Yes, dear, second cousin twice removed on his father's side.
Hello, Aunt Susan.
Charlie.
This is your cousin Cicily.
I'm so glad.
How do you do?
And here's Fred.
Oh...
Do we have to shake hands?
Oh, come now, boys, whatever the quarrel is between you two...
No quarrel on my side.
No?
Mmm-mmm.
All right, skip it.
When are you going to read the will?
As soon as the others arrive.
What others? Of course, there's Joyce.
Yes, Joyce Norman.
Joyce... Is she the one that draws pictures for the magazines?
Mmm-hmm. The other's
Wally Campbell.
Wally Campbell, the actor?
On the radio?
The original flutterbrain.
Well, maybe I'm going to like this place after all.
Hey!
I'm not really frightened,
I'm just naturally nervous.
Eating in restaurants all the time, up half the night playing Chinese checkers.
Besides, this is my first sea voyage.
You seem like the jolly type,
Clarence. Do you like jokes?
You don't mind if I ramble on, do you?
It kinda keeps my mind off the malaria germs.
Anyway, here's one.
A farmer had a cow, see, but he couldn't afford to feed it alfalfa, so he fed it sawdust.
He saved a lot of money, all right, but he sure wasted plenty of time getting the splinters out of the milk.
Doesn't that just...
Splinters, milk.
Don't you get it?
Hmm. Heard it last year.
Jack Benny Program.
Yes, Cyrus Canby Norman died in that room across the hall, hating all his close relatives.
Well, he certainly didn't hate me.
And if Cyrus turned against any of us, I know where to put the blame.
It was the influence of that...
What is it,
Miss Lu?
Mr. Campbell is here.
Introducing your favorite and mine, Wally Campbell.
May I join the party?
I was invited.
I hear old Uncle Cyrus's ghost is holding bank night.
Oh, I'm sorry, just a pleasantry.
Hello, Mr. Crosby.
Hello, Wally.
This is your cousin,
Miss Susan Tilbury.
I'm charmed. How do you do? He's the actor.
Your cousin,
Cicily Young.
How do you do?
Fred Blythe and Charlie Wilder.
Nice to see you.
Thanks, thanks.
Well, where's the leading lady?
Leading lady?
Young man, did you inherit the streak of insanity that runs in this family?
What was that leading lady crack?
Oh, nothing really, but all this, midnight, the alligators...
I mean, the heirs, and the family lawyer all gathering to hear the reading of the will.
It reminds me of a lot of melodramas and murder mysteries I played in.
It does?
Thanks.
And in every one of those plays, there was a leading lady, young, beautiful, modern, charming...
Would you take this for me, please? Thanks.
Well, I got here.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry to be so late.
Oh, dear Aunt Susan.
And Cicily. Well, this is like old times.
Charlie, they told me you weren't coming.
It's good to see you.
And, Fred.
Hello, honey.
And...
Well, of all people,
Wally Campbell.
Well, don't you remember?
The little girl you took to a high school dance and deserted.
You used to call me the twerp.
The twerp?
Joyce Norman! Say, when did you grow up and get pretty?
Have I kept you waiting?
I'm so sorry.
That's all right, my dear.
Now, shall we proceed?
What a house.
Isn't it?
That's Uncle Cy.
Hello, Uncle Cy.
They tell me he was so crooked that when he died, they had to screw him into the ground.
Shh. Quiet.
Oh, sorry. Here you are, Joyce.
Thank you,
Charlie.
Now as soon as we're all comfortably settled, we'll begin.
Here.
Thanks.
Mr. Norman made his will in two parts.
I will now read the contents of envelope number one.
Oh, tell me. Tell me.
Miss Lu? Miss Lu?
Tell me the name, Master.
The name.
Miss Lu!
What?
What was that noise, like a gong?
It's the warning.
It came just before the master died.
You know, I've been thinking there's no use in my staying here.
After all, I've never inherited anything, except hay fever.
So if nobody objects, I think
I'll swim back to the mainland.
You're going to stay right here...
Yeah, but I can...
I have a million questions to ask you.
Yeah, well, ask her one for me about those seven bells.
They are the spirits.
They mean seven may live.
There are eight people in this room.
One will die before morning.
I feel very faint.
Yeah, well, it's been nice knowing you all but honestly, it's hot in here,
I have to get some air. I...
Now, wait, wait.
Stop all this, Miss Lu.
Do you want to frighten these ladies out of their wits?
There's not much danger of that.
It has happened.
The insane asylums are full of people who've lost their minds through fright.
Oh, may we hear the will, please?
Yes, let's hear it.
I'll bet you two to one that Joyce is the heir.
What's that?
Oh, did I speak out of turn?
What was at the back of your remark?
Oh, why, nothing.
Come on, you know something.
Oh, nothing really.
Well, it's just that in practically every mystery play I've been in, the leading lady turns out to be the heir.
You have the power.
Yes, I... Me?
There are spirits all around you.
Well, could you put some in a glass with little ice?
I need it badly.
Don't you ever stop babbling?
Attention, please.
Usual date and so on.
"I, Cyrus Canby Norman, being of sound mind and body,
"do hereby bequeath all my money, bonds, securities and estate
"under the following provisions.
"Whereas I believe a streak of insanity to be in the family,
"in the event that the heir hereinafter named
"should prove to be of unsound mind,
"or if said heir should become insane
"or should meet death within a month of inheriting,
"then my estate is to be given to the person
"whose name is contained in envelope number two."
Was that his idea or yours?
What's wrong with it?
Well, that will is practically an invitation to commit murder.
Murder?
Certainly.
What's behind that "meeting death or insanity within a month of inheriting"?
That's easily explained.
Mr. Norman was afraid that the shock of inheriting the fortune might prove too much for an unbalanced brain.
And it's also a strong encouragement to the number two heir to do everything possible to unbalance the brain of the number one heir.
Fred, come off. You're talking a lot of nonsense.
Yeah? Murder is committed frequently for less money than old Cyrus left.
That, gentlemen, is precisely the reason why the name of the alternative heir was sealed in this envelope, so that no one should know his identity.
Yeah?
You know who it is, don't you?
Naturally, I drew the will.
"I therefore will that my entire estate be divided equally
"among such descendants of mine of sound mind and body
"who are assembled in my library at midnight
"on the 10th anniversary of my death,
"who bear the surname of Norman."
Norman?
Well, I'm the only one here with that name.
What did I tell you?
I knew it.
It becomes my pleasant duty to proclaim you the sole heiress of the Norman fortune and the new mistress of this old house.
And I sincerely trust that this second envelope shall never be opened.
Thank you.
Oh, it's wonderful,
Joyce, I'm so glad.
Thanks, Charlie.
I congratulate you with all my heart, Joyce.
Well, that's sweet of you, Fred.
It's so unexpected,
I can hardly believe it.
I wish I couldn't believe it.
I'm sorry, Cicily.
You're not a bit sorry.
I know I shouldn't be if I were the heir.
Well, I congratulate you, dear, with definite reservations.
Oh, thanks, darling.
Well...
Well, aren't you going to congratulate me?
Oh, sure. I'll do more than that.
I'll recommend a nice, quiet bombproof cellar to you for the next 30 days.
Thanks.
Here are the keys to the house, Miss Norman.
Oh, well, won't you remain as my housekeeper?
Mr. Norman told me to give this letter to the heir after the will was read.
How did he know you'd be here?
I told him I would be.
It's the first
I've known of it.
Well, what do you suppose...
That's probably about the buried treasure.
Buried treasure!
What are you talking about?
Yeah, well, there's always a buried treasure, isn't there?
You know a pot of gold, or a diamond necklace, or a...
Don't pin me down.
It's very peculiar that you should mention a necklace.
Yeah? Why?
There was one.
See!
Well, did somebody tell you about it?
Now let me think. Oh, it must have been my mother.
The last time you saw your mother, you were three years old.
Yeah, I was just...
I doubt if you'd remember the conversation.
What sort of a necklace was it, Aunt Susan?
Diamonds and emeralds, worth a fortune.
After Cyrus had it made, it was stolen.
Who stole it?
Well, don't look at me.
I just got here.
I've never believed it was stolen.
I always thought Mr. Norman hid it here in this house.
Why would he do that?
Because he was a nut.
There's food in the dining room.
I don't want anything to eat.
Personally, I've changed my plans and I'm leaving.
That's impossible, there are no more trains out until morning, even if you could get to the mainland.
Why can't we get to the mainland?
Because of members of Local Number
2 of the Bayou Canoe Paddlers and Putt Putt Pushers Union won't putt after midnight.
You mean we've got to stay here whether we like it or not?
I arranged it that way and I think you'll all be very comfortable.
So shall we eat, drink and be merry?
For tomorrow, we...
It's on the house.
My house, come on.
Cicily.
I could use a drink.
Yeah, I could, too.
I think I could stiff.
Might as well be a live stiff as a dead stiff.
Since we are all to be prisoners in this terrible house until tomorrow morning,
I suggest that you and I sleep together.
I suggest we all sleep together.
Miss Lu knew we'd have to stay here and...
Oh, Miss Lu.
I don't know much about the house yet, but are there rooms for everyone?
Yes, Miss Norman. The main bedroom, your bedroom, is here.
Mr. Campbell, at the head of the stairs, Lawyer Crosby...
What happened?
They do that when you don't pay your bill. Are you all right?
Yes, of course, but...
Well, how am I?
I'm all right, I always shake this way. Don't...
Well, what in the world's the matter, Miss Lu?
Miss Lu?
Did you have to break one of those old crystal glasses?
I didn't break it.
It was knocked out of my hand.
Come on.
Don't take it so big.
Go ahead.
Keep your shirt on.
I'm just telling you, you keep away from Joyce.
What's the matter? Not afraid of a little healthy competition, are you?
I'm not afraid of anything you've got to offer. I'm just warning you.
Yeah?
What's this all about? I wouldn't know.
Better ask Fred.
Why blame it on me?
Two grown men, it's too absurd.
Fred, I want to talk to Charlie.
Oh?
I'll just be a minute.
Same old Casanova.
Well, I'll be in the dining room, if you need me.
Now, Charlie, once and for all...
Joyce, why do you hate me?
I don't hate you,
Charlie, I...
You were in love with me once.
No.
Yes, you were.
Darling, can't we...
We had this all out a long time ago, Charlie.
Give me another chance, Joyce.
I won't fail you this time,
I swear I won't.
You can forget that girl.
No, it wasn't just that, it was...
We can't thrash it out tonight.
Tomorrow, then.
Tomorrow is better.
Yes, tomorrow is much better.
Here you are, Cicily.
Oh, thank you, Wally.
You know, I've always wanted to be an actress and now, just think of it, some of the same blood that flows through my veins flows through yours.
Yeah, it's gruesome, isn't it?
Let's change the subject.
I may not see you people in the morning,
I have a luncheon engagement in New Orleans.
I have to get up early.
Early? Well, you certainly don't expect to sleep in this terrible house.
Don't big, empty houses scare you?
Not me, I used to be in vaudeville.
Oh...
Here.
Oh, Wally, you give me such a comfortable feeling.
First this old house gave me the creeps.
But with you here,
I don't know what fear is.
That's right, nobody's afraid of an old house except a coward.
Turn out the lights.
What is it?
I don't know.
He's coming toward the house.
Oh, Cicily.
What are you doing?
It's the only way to stop a scream.
Oh, is that so? With me, it's for sneezing.
With me, it's for screaming.
Oh, I didn't...
I got it. Hold it.
Cicily!
She's all right.
She's okay.
We thought we heard some shots.
We thought we did, too. Well, hadn't we better investigate?
Say, maybe you're right.
You may be wrong, though.
Well, I want to go, too.
No, you'd better stay here with Cicily. Come on, Wally.
Oh, no. I'm awfully sorry.
I screamed...
What is it?
Could I talk to you a moment, sir?
Well, come in.
I don't want to alarm you folks, but...
But what?
I'm the head guard over at Fairview.
Fairview?
The insane asylum?
Yes, ma'am. One of our patients got away from us this afternoon.
That's all we needed.
Well, anyway, he'll feel right at home here.
Is he a dangerous maniac?
Yes, ma'am, he's...
He's a killer.
Oh!
How did he escape?
I wish I knew.
We followed him into the bayous, but then we lost him.
But you took a couple of shots at something out in the garden.
I thought I saw him, but the shadows fooled me.
What does the poor fellow look like?
Say, don't waste any sympathy on him, mister.
He'd just as soon rip you wide open as not.
Oh, please, please. There are ladies are present.
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am.
We're still waiting to hear what he looks like.
Oh. Well, he's about 40, but strong as a tiger.
He has sharp teeth and long fingers and fingernails like claws.
And when he's violent, he crawls around on all fours like a...
Like an animal?
Yes, sir, like a cat.
What some guys won't do for a laugh.
Look!
Scat!
That's a good joke on us, all right.
Yeah, I'll say.
That's better.
Well, I guess
I'll be moving on.
Maybe he isn't even around here.
But if I were you,
I'd stay in the house and be sure that all the outside windows and doors are locked.
I agree with you, locked and nailed. I'll handle that.
Won't we?
I'll be around the neighborhood and let you know if we get the Cat.
The what?
Uh, the Cat. That's what the other inmates call him, but they're all crazy.
Well, good night.
Good night.
Listen, I don't think we better say anything about this to Joyce or Cicily.
That's right, there's no use in frightening them, too.
That's a fatheaded suggestion of yours.
If there's any danger, they ought to know it.
Well, somebody ought to go down and lock the cellar doors and windows, anyhow.
Yeah, well I'm going.
I'm... Don't rush me.
I'm going to ask you all not to tell the girls.
Have I your promise?
Good heavens, do you think I'm the type that can't keep a secret?
It's understood, then?
Hey, what's going on?
What are you all talking about?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Well, I'm going to bed.
Good night, all.
Good night.
If you're going to lock up the cellar, you'd better do it now.
That's right.
Oh, that's right.
Is anything the matter?
No, nothing's the matter.
Except there's a maniac loose in this house and we'll all be murdered in our beds.
That a girl. Hold it right there. Stay there.
Well, where's that cellar?
Oh, say, in case I don't come up in about five minutes, better make it four, or even three, you...
Is there a Brother Elk in the house?
I'm not an Elk, but I used to be a Girl Scout.
Oh, good, then you can start a fire with sticks in case our feet freeze.
Come on.
Well, everything's fine.
Well, don't you people want anything more to eat?
Uh-uh.
What's going on?
Oh!
Why...
You go ahead. I'll be with you in a minute.
Listen, Joyce...
Uh-huh?
You know how it is in a play, when just before the first act is over somebody always comes to the beautiful heroine and tells her that she's in great danger, and sometimes she is?
What are you talking about?
Yeah, I know it sounds kind of silly, but...
Keep your eyes open, baby.
Thanks.
Well...
Say, why don't you go to the library? It's much nicer in there.
The library, nicer?
What are you...
Well... Well, there's a lamp there.
It hasn't got the jitters like these lights.
Can't do more than explode.
Hey! I'm scared.
Aren't you coming?
Did you find out? Can we go through that way?
Uh-huh.
Oh, well...
Well, I'll be seeing you, I hope.
This is the door all right, but it won't open.
The key, honey.
One turn...
Oh.
Here's a switch.
Won't switch.
You want to go first?
Yeah! No, no.
Certainly not. Ladies always go first.
Oh.
Go ahead.
Thanks.
I think it was awful funny what Miss Lu said about the spirits being all around you.
What's funny about it?
Well, I mean, I'm psychic, too. I was in a trance once.
I know, I know. When are you coming out of it?
Just kidding.
It's awful spooky down here.
Do you believe in reincarnation?
Huh?
You know, that dead people come back?
You mean like the Republicans?
Shh, listen.
What's the matter?
That noise.
Well, what kind of a noise?
It sounds like wheels going around.
Shh. Watch that step.
Watch that...
Hey!
Hold my nose.
I'm screaming!
I can't.
Why can't you?
It's got me. It's got my hands. It's got me.
What?
It's got me. I...
Cheese!
You're not hurt?
No, this one here.
Look, look.
Hurry, hurry.
Oh.
My knee.
Oh, you're not hurt. Come on. We've got work to do.
That window's barred.
I like that.
I hear it now.
What? That noise you just heard.
It's in there.
Oh, that's it.
A home electric plant.
They're nothing but trouble.
How come you know?
We had one down on the farm.
I used to fix it so the lights would go out when my boyfriend was calling on me.
Oh, yeah? Did anything happen when the lights went out?
He always went to sleep.
Wally?
Oh, Mr. Crosby.
Hello, Joyce.
You here alone?
I don't want to worry you, but there's something you ought to know.
Well, won't it keep until morning?
Tomorrow may be too late.
You know, Mr. Norman was a very eccentric man, and I've just made a discovery.
I've been going through some old papers of Mr. Norman's and I...
And I've found something which... Well...
It convinced me it would be dangerous for you to be left here alone.
Mr. Crosby, really.
Don't laugh, Joyce. I know what
I'm talking about, believe me.
I'm alarmed.
I want you to take me seriously.
Joyce, you're in danger, great danger.
Thank heaven I can tell you who they...
I've heard so much about ghosts and spirits tonight that I...
I'm getting jittery.
I'd rather not hear...
Mr. Crosby?
Mr. Crosby?
Oh. Where did
Mr. Crosby go?
I haven't seen him, miss.
But he must have passed you in the hall.
I haven't seen anyone.
Wally. Charlie! Aunt Susan! Wally Campbell.
Coming.
Did someone call?
Are you sure Mr. Crosby wasn't in the dining room?
Positive.
And you didn't see him as you came downstairs?
I did not.
What's wrong?
Well, it's unbelievable.
A few moments ago
I was sitting there,
Mr. Crosby was over there talking to me and suddenly he...
He vanished.
Vanished?
But, Joyce, people don't just vanish.
Well, Mr. Crosby did.
I ran to the door and Miss Lu was there.
I swear nobody left this room.
Are you sure he was in here?
Well, of course.
You must've heard him talking to me.
I only heard you, talking to yourself.
Well, I'm afraid the strain of excitement's been too much for you, Joyce.
When a woman starts talking to herself, when she sees people vanish right in front of her...
Oh, good heavens, what am I saying?
You're inferring rather plainly that Joyce is losing her mind.
Really? Oh, dear.
You mean you don't believe me?
Why, certainly we do.
Certainly.
But you do believe Mr. Crosby disappeared in front of me?
Well, if that's my imagination, where's Mr. Crosby?
Well, he's probably out in the garden with Fred.
Come, Cicily, let's go to our room, pile the furniture in front of the door and go to bed.
With a house full of maniacs, what good is the bed?
There must be some explanation.
Look, where was Crosby standing when he disappeared?
Exactly where Wally is now.
Can you still see me?
Wally, do go outside and see if Mr. Crosby's with Fred.
Outside?
I'll go...
Oh, but, don't you think I... I'll go.
Charlie, you look upstairs in Mr. Crosby's room.
All right. We'll find him. Don't worry. Yeah?
"You will open this envelope tonight in my room, where you are to sleep."
That's the room where he died.
Oh, I didn't hear you come in.
The room is ready for you, if you aren't afraid to sleep there.
Unpack my bags, please.
I'll be right in.
Have they found
Mr. Crosby?
Nobody's going to find Mr. Crosby.
The demon in this house has got him.
Don't say such things.
Fred?
Oh, Fred?
Is that you, Fred?
Are you catching cold? Your voice sounds a little hoarse.
Fred?
Oh, it's you.
What do you want?
I was...
Hello. Have you seen Crosby?
No.
When did you come in from the garden?
Who told you
I was out there?
Well, I was just...
Why, everybody.
Everybody was wrong.
What's your game,
Campbell?
My game?
Well, I shoot between 90 and 100.
I used to hook my drives but now I slice my putts.
Have you tried that...
Whatever you're trying to do, keep away from Joyce.
Let her alone, see?
Just let her alone.
I'll put these in the top drawer, miss.
Thank you.
When did Uncle Cyrus give you this?
Ten years ago tonight, just before he died on that bed.
It's no use, miss, trying to keep it to yourself.
Keep what to myself?
The thing that frightened you just before you ran in here.
Oh, that was only my imagination.
It was a warning.
I don't believe in spirits, Miss Lu.
You're afraid.
You're afraid the demon that got
Mr. Crosby is coming after you.
Why, that's absurd.
What is it?
Hello.
Oh, Charlie, what is it?
Well, it's...
Miss Lu, aren't you through in here?
Yes.
Well...
Joyce, you'd better lock your door tonight.
Why?
Oh, just to be on the safe side.
Perhaps I'd better sleep in the library.
Oh. Why should you do that?
In case you need me.
Why should I need you?
I don't know.
You might get nervous or something.
What about? Everyone seems to be acting so strangely,
I'm beginning to think
I'm losing my mind.
Well, anyway, if you want me, call.
Thanks.
Oh, and, Joyce, don't forget your promise to...
See you tomorrow.
Oh.
Don't worry about a thing.
You don't have to lock it, I'm here.
No, I'm rather glad you are here, Wally.
Oh, really?
Yeah, it's nice seeing each other again like this after all these years.
Mmm-hmm.
How you feeling?
Oh, I'm all right.
I'd feel better if they'd find Mr. Crosby.
Wally, tell me, what's going on?
What are you all driving at?
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know.
But whatever it is,
I just want to tell you that I'll protect you.
There isn't anything living that I'm afraid of, hardly.
Oh! It's only the clock.
Oh.
Oh, I thought my time had come.
I'm awfully sorry. I guess this house is getting me.
Now what was I saying? Oh, yes.
I'm not afraid of...
You know I'm lying, don't you?
I'm scared stiff.
But I'm always like that.
I'm always nervous just before I go into action, so scared or not, you're gonna get protected.
You always did fight for me, didn't you, Wally?
Even back there in Wickford.
Remember when you used to carry my books to school?
Yeah, what a racket that was.
Yes, and the time Big
Jim Daley pulled my hair and you flew at him and what a terrible beating...
He gave me.
I'll never forget it.
Seems I always got licked fighting for you.
Well, maybe it was worth it.
Cicily!
Oh, listen, Joyce, if there's a rumpus or anything, don't come out.
You just sit tight and yell like the devil.
Well, what will you do?
Why, I'll...
I'll run and get help.
Don't worry.
I don't worry when you're around, Wally.
Oh, really?
Mmm-hmm.
Thanks. Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
It just makes my heart ache to see her.
I'm afraid she's beginning to break.
Who, Aunt Sue?
Joyce.
All she needs is one more shock.
A remark like that wouldn't sound very well, in case you happened to be the second heir.
If Cyrus hadn't been utterly incompetent,
I'd have been the first heir.
What's that?
Mr. Crosby?
No, sir. This is
Hendricks, from the asylum.
Can I be of any service to you?
I thought you'd gone.
I can't leave, ma'am, till my men come back for me with the boat.
Oh. Well, have you seen Mr. Crosby?
He's the grey-haired gentleman you were talking to a while ago.
No,
I haven't.
He disappeared.
He couldn't have gone far, unless he went swimming.
Would you mind looking about the grounds for him? lt'll be a pleasure, ma'am.
Thank you so much.
Well, if you need me, just call.
My room is right up there.
Thanks, Fred. I guess
I'll be pretty safe tonight with all the men guarding me.
Charlie just told me the same thing.
So he was here.
Leave it to him to get anywhere first.
Shh!
I wouldn't do that if
I were you, beautiful.
Do what?
Entertain any more people in your room tonight.
I won't.
Have you read the letter?
No, I haven't.
Wally, come in here a minute.
"You will open this envelope tonight in my room,
"where you are to sleep."
Don't do it.
Why not?
I don't know. My Aunt Minnie brought me up to always bite half dollars.
Look, Miss Lu says that
Mr. Norman gave this to her.
But how do we know he did?
Maybe Miss Lu is in cahoots with someone who wants to know exactly where he can find you tonight, while you're alone.
But who would that be?
Well, the person whose name is in the envelope that Crosby has.
Whoever it is would become the heir, in case you were out of the way.
Wally, that's a horrible thought.
Yes, it is, isn't it?
I got goose pimples.
Even my goose pimples have goose pimples.
Let's get a gulp of fresh air.
I'll bet there hasn't been any fresh air in this house for a long time.
There. That's better.
Yes.
Oh, you're going to...
I thought I would as long as you're here.
"To my unknown heir, man or woman,
"because I can take no earthly possessions with me
"I am compelled to leave them to you.
"Your hour will come, too."
"In your brief span of life,
"enjoy the glittering symbols of the world, which I now renounce."
Ooh, that gives me the creeps.
Here's a verse. It's a little more cheerful.
"Find the number beneath the vine.
"The sparkling gems will then be thine.
"O love, what number rhymes with mine?"
It's a silly little verse.
Yeah.
Say, Wally, it's the key to the necklace.
Yeah.
"What number rhymes with mine?"
Well, it ain't 10.
Nine. "Beneath the vine."
That must be outdoors in the garden.
Why does he say "o love"?
What does love have to do with it?
Love, affection, Venus, the goddess of love.
Say, is there a statue of Venus around this joint anywhere? I don't know.
Wait.
Look.
The fountain.
Cupid. Sure. Venus' little problem child.
Let's go.
Let me get my jacket.
Wally.
Hmm?
Look.
How funny.
How comforting.
Come on.
Which way?
Up there at the end of the hall.
Shh.
There's someone in
Mr. Crosby's room.
Maybe it's
Mr. Crosby.
What are you doing in there?
Waiting.
What's she waiting for?
Certainly will be glad to get out of this terrible house.
Well, here's love.
The vine. The vine.
Beneath the vine.
Yes, the vine.
Do you suppose we have to dig it up by the roots?
I don't see any number nine.
Look, look, the knobs.
Yeah. Maybe he meant the ninth knob.
Where do they start? I don't know.
One, two, three, four, five...
Six, seven, eight, nine.
Wait a minute. Here's one that's loose.
Now that we got it, what are we going to do with it?
I don't know.
Turn it, pull it.
Nothing happens.
Well, Uncle Cyrus was left-handed.
Would that make any difference? No.
Well, maybe.
No, I guess the old boy was kidding.
It's no good.
Oh, dear.
Hey, look.
Say...
What's the matter?
Something soft.
Here, I'll get it.
No, I... Let me.
Say...
Wow!
I bet there's a catch in this somewhere.
Oh, Wally!
Say, wouldn't it be a good idea to put it back in there where it'll be safe until daylight?
Well, I don't know... No, I think it'll be safer with me.
Come on, let's go.
Isn't it terrific?
Terrific.
Thanks for everything, Wally.
Uh, say, if you're gonna sleep with those pebbles tonight, you'd better take the gun.
You used to be quite a shot with an air rifle.
Remember the time you shot the hole in old Scrooge's silk hat?
I haven't fired a gun since...
Did you know this was empty?
Empty?
How do you like that?
Hey, wait a minute, I was out there all alone.
Never in my...
Oh. I guess I'm beginning to see things.
What is the matter?
I don't know, only...
I guess, I think.
What's that?
Think nothing of it.
Now, what were you saying?
Keep talking.
It wasn't important.
It was only that I think every woman is happier when she has a lot of...
Oh, be careful.
A cat.
Of all the ridiculous things I ever saw in my life.
You with the chair, creeping up to the window.
Wham! And a cat.
Take it easy.
Joyce! Joyce!
Aunt Sue is loose again.
Joyce! Joyce, are you there? Open up.
Yes. In a minute.
Come on.
Wait. My mother brought me up never to be caught twice in the same lady's bedroom.
Joyce!
Joyce, what happened?
Just a minute.
Open the door, Joyce.
Are you all right? Oh, yes, I am all right.
It was so silly.
What?
I wanted to get a breath of fresh air and the window stuck.
I broke it just as I was trying to open it.
Oh, is that all? How did you get the...
But then I got all tangled up in the curtain with the cat.
The cat. Miss Lu, will you please take your cat?
Now I promise to go straight to bed and I won't disturb you any more.
Well, that window is barred, so I guess it's all right.
Good night.
Oh, wait for me, Fred. Good night, dear.
Good night.
Did you say the window stuck?
Yes, it stuck.
Okay.
Wally. Wally!
Come in.
Pretty good, huh?
Ouch!
Riding boots.
I suppose your Aunt Minnie taught you that cute trick.
No, I got that one from her boyfriend.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, I guess
I'll run along.
Do you want me to lock the shutters?
No. Just don't make any more noise.
Oh. Well, good night.
The road's clear. Be sure and lock the door after me.
Don't worry,
I will.
Good night, beautiful.
I didn't mean to be cross.
I'm getting so nervous, I could holler.
Would you like something to quiet you? A sleeping powder?
No, thanks. I have one in my bag.
Well, how about letting me have it?
Good night, Wally.
Never mind the powder.
Who wants to sleep?
Open! Please!
Please, Wally!
Joyce, open up.
Open the door.
Haven't you got another key?
It's locked on the inside. What's happened?
We don't know.
She's alive, thank heaven.
Miss Lu, get a little brandy.
Please help! Please, oh, please! Help me! Wally!
What happened, baby?
I don't know. My eyes were closed.
It was a hand! It came from the dark.
I felt it.
For heaven's sake, do try to be coherent!
Well, it touched me!
The necklace.
It's gone.
What necklace?
Well, the necklace.
Wally and I, we found it in the garden.
Hanging from a tree, I suppose.
It's true, we did find it.
But it's gone.
The hand took it.
Hand. What hand?
Oh, I don't know.
Just a hand.
It came out of the wall.
Oh. We'd better send for a doctor.
An alienist would be better.
The poor child's gone stark staring mad.
Shut up.
Every one of you thinks just the same as I do, that Joyce has lost her mind.
But I haven't.
You must believe me.
How can we, Joyce?
After all, when someone starts concocting a story about a hand coming out of a wall...
You can't...
You don't really think that I...
Susan's right.
Every one of you feels exactly as she feels about me, only...
Only they haven't got the courage to say it.
I don't.
I know you don't, Wally.
I've been through enough tonight to drive anyone mad.
But I'm not.
Now listen.
Wally and I found the necklace that Cyrus left me in the garden.
Then he said good night to me and I got ready for bed.
Someone was watching me. I know that now.
Someone who was trying to frighten me.
Then...
Just as I was falling asleep,
I felt somebody in the room.
I opened my eyes, a long claw-like hand came out of the wall!
And it came nearer and nearer to me...
I couldn't move and it touched me.
Very sad.
You'd all like to prove that
Joyce is crazy, wouldn't you?
Because that would give you another chance at old Norman's dough.
That's pretty rotten talk, Wally.
Well, that's the way I feel.
Personally,
I believe Joyce.
You believe that fantastic story?
Haven't you clucks ever heard of secret passageways and panels?
Panels.
Well, how else could the hand that Joyce saw come through the wall?
Let's see this.
It came from right there, Wally.
Well, there's nothing here.
Wait a minute.
This is loose.
Hey, what's this?
Listen, baby, don't be surprised if we discover an old skeleton in here.
Crosby.
He's dead.
What a terrible thing.
Poor Mr. Crosby.
It might just as well have been any one of us.
Can you imagine being in bed with a hand reaching for your throat?
Quiet! Where's Joyce?
Miss Lu and Wally took her into the dining room.
The poor kid. What she's been through.
Isn't anybody going to do something?
Well, if you mean isn't anybody going into that dark passage to argue with a maniac, the answer is no.
You know, I doubt very much that it was a maniac.
Whoever it was in that secret passage acted quite sanely.
That's right.
What would a lunatic want with a necklace?
Don't ask me.
You've got to be loony to answer that question.
Just what's in your mind, Fred?
Well, I...
Wait a minute.
If somebody's trying to drive Joyce out of her mind, it's no impromptu affair.
Well, one of our little family party has called the turn on everything that's happened here tonight.
Uh-huh,
Wally Campbell.
That's a lot of hooey.
Yeah? Don't you remember he wanted to bet you that
Joyce would be the heir?
Yeah.
Well, he was with Joyce when she located the necklace.
But he wasn't with her when it was taken.
And he knew where to find that secret panel in the wall, too.
If you're hinting that Wally
Campbell murdered Mr. Crosby,
I don't believe it!
Neither do I.
Oh, darling, are you better?
Yes, I'm all right but what were you saying?
Go on. I want to hear it.
Well, I was just...
Go ahead, Fred.
I'm just saying, suppose Wally knew that his name was in that second envelope. As the alternate heir?
Well, that's ridiculous. How could he know?
How could anyone?
Someone knew.
Both envelopes had been opened before Lawyer Crosby got here tonight.
Now I know what happened to Crosby.
There must be an entrance to that secret passageway from this room.
What?
Yeah.
Crosby knew the danger Joyce was in, and while he was warning her...
Somebody pulled him in behind the panel and strangled him.
The explanation is so obvious to anyone with an ounce of brains.
You don't have to get insulting about it.
It was a pleasure.
Maybe you and I had better finish this conversation outside.
All right. Fine.
Hey, now. Cut it.
Listen, you gave Wally plenty of reason for any crack he could think of. Now cool off!
A fight won't prove who killed Crosby.
That's the important thing right now.
There's that clock.
It isn't the clock.
Oh.
Five.
Six.
The warning has come again.
Oh.
Nothing can stop it.
Oh.
Last time that gong rang, Mr. Crosby...
All right, take it easy, Cicily.
I'm going to my room.
If Charlie will walk upstairs with me.
Certainly.
And we'll be glad to have you,
Joyce, if you care to join us.
Thanks.
Listen, everybody, until we can notify the police, nobody, under any circumstances, is to go into that room where Mr. Crosby is.
Who wants to?
Whether you want to or not, that's the law.
Meanwhile, I'll try to find Hendricks and send him for the police.
You know this whole thing has a phony ring to me.
A killer who thinks he's a cat.
Have you ever seen a man who looked and acted like a cat?
A woman, yes.
But a man...
Anyway, how do we know a lunatic escaped from an asylum?
Well, the guard,
Hendricks.
Yeah, but how do you know he is a guard?
Just because he wears a cap and a badge?
You can rent them at any costumers.
All right. But why?
To frighten you out of your beautiful wits, baby.
Yes. But why should he?
Why should he?
I don't know.
I wish I knew who that next heir is.
Maybe it's a woman.
Let's see. What women have we?
There's Miss Lu.
Miss Lu, how about her?
She must know a lot about that secret panel.
Why has she lived here all these years if she didn't expect to...
What's the matter?
I'm going into that bedroom and get that envelope out of Crosby's pocket.
The name of the second heir is in that envelope, and the name of the second heir is the name of the murderer.
Oh, if it turns out to be my name, I'm only kidding.
Wally, please don't go in there.
Suppose we've been overheard?
Suppose the murderer knows you're on the right track?
What good would an empty gun be?
But it isn't empty now.
I found the bullets.
Where?
In Miss Lu's room. Here.
You keep it. Well...
Well, legs, let's get going.
Oh, Wally, how can you joke?
I always joke when I'm scared.
I kind of kid myself into being brave.
Ain't that silly?
Uh-huh.
Oh, easy, baby, easy.
I remember a situation almost like this in an old play called The Fatal Hour, or She Should've
Known Better.
At the end of the second act, the leading man takes the heroine in his arms and kisses her.
Then, filled with new courage, he starts out after the villain.
And of course, he comes back in the third act?
Oh, sure.
No, in the third act he's found dead in the bathtub.
Oh, well, that was just a play.
I'll leave the door open.
Say, if anybody comes down, don't let them know what I'm doing.
Wally!
Wally, what is it? Wally!
Somebody please! Wally.
What's happened now?
I don't know.
I don't know. Look, is he badly hurt?
He's got a swell bump.
It's hard to say whether somebody hit him or whether it came from a fall.
What was he doing in here?
He came to get the... To get my jacket.
Charlie?
Hmm?
It's gone.
What?
Crosby's gone.
Oh.
Who could've done such a thing?
The one who killed him.
The law can't convict you of murder if there's no corpse.
Help me up.
Who did it?
I haven't the smokiest idea. I was just...
What became of Crosby?
Are you sure you don't know?
I'm not sure of anything.
Just when I get the whole thing figured out, it goes and gets itself all balled up again.
We saw Crosby fall to the floor, didn't we?
Yes. He was dead, wasn't he?
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Ah-ha!
What is it, Wally, what is it?
How do we know he was dead?
He was, wasn't he?
Well, I suppose he was, but that doesn't prove it.
I couldn't swear he was dead, neither could you.
Could you? What are you getting at?
Maybe the whole thing was only a plant.
Maybe he was faking all the time to frighten you and waiting in there to wallop me.
Oh, no, Wally.
No. You don't think much of that?
No.
Neither do I.
Oh, Charlie, did you find Hendricks?
Yes. He said the police can't reach here until morning.
He's still waiting for his own men.
They're lost somewhere in the bayou.
The telephone.
Either you don't know the nearest telephone is 20 miles away or else you should know more about this thing than is good for you.
Who? Me?
Same place.
Why don't they have a telephone?
People going around here bopping each other on the head, they need a phone.
What is it?
Nothing, I just wanted to make sure you were all right.
Thank you, Charlie.
I can't stand another minute.
Oh, that's just what they're hoping for, honey.
But you can take it. Come on, roll with the punches.
Let's go over here by the fireplace and relax. There.
You know, what this party needs is more drinks and more laughs.
I'll tell you.
I'll bring a bottle of
Scotch from the dining room and we'll sit around here and drink Scotch and make wry faces.
You get it?
Scotch and rye?
Here. I don't need a gun with jokes like that.
Look, you play Jesse James and I'll play, well...
Well, I'll play like I'm getting a bottle of Scotch.
Come on, relax.
All right.
Whoever it is, speak or I'll fire.
Speak or I'll fire.
I knew it. Joyce!
Joyce!
Joyce, look here.
Wally?
Wally, where are you?
Wally?
Wally!
Joyce, I found it, the clue. I...
Joyce.
Joyce!
Joyce!
No, you don't.
One killing is enough.
Bringing guns and scaring women's one thing, murder's something else.
I'm all washed up.
Where's that necklace?
That's all I want out of this.
Joyce!
I wouldn't do that if I were you, Charlie.
Charlie!
Don't move.
You robbed me of my inheritance.
I was the old man's favorite.
I should have been his heir.
I am the next heir.
Stop.
I've waited 10 years for this.
You poisoned old man
Norman's mind against me.
I've always hated you.
And now
I've got you.
Don't come any closer.
Don't take another step.
Joyce! Joyce!
Wally!
Where are you, Joyce?
Joyce, are you all right?
Yeah, she's all right.
Oh, boy. Some fun.
Hold it. Miss Norman, tell me...
Oh, don't ask me questions, boys.
Wally, Mr. Campbell here, is the real hero.
Mr. Campbell, what was the clue you found?
Hold it.
You'll get a better picture of me from a front angle, Rembrandt.
I knew all the time that whoever killed Crosby was the second heir.
And you found the second envelope?
I found it in the coat that was covering Crosby's body in the secret passage.
It was Wilder's coat.
Say, you better get a couple of shots of Miss Norman and me together.
You're liable to need them very soon for your page of social events.
Yeah?
Congratulations.
How did you know... Do you intend to live in your house,
Miss Norman?
No, it's
Miss Lu's now.
I'm giving it to her.
How did you know the
Cat was Charlie Wilder?
Well, I found something earlier in the night on the floor in the hallway.
What, a weapon?
Patience.
You know,
I always suspected that the
Cat was wearing a make-up.
As an actor I've often used sponge rubber in putting on a character make-up.
So, gentlemen, when I found this piece of sponge rubber...
Sponge rubber?
Have you got it?
Let me get a picture of it. Of course, my good man.
Shove off.
There they go.
Why don't we get started?
Bye.
Goodbye, Joyce.
Bye, Wally.
Goodbye. Bye.
Wally. This rubber, it must have fallen out of my coat.
It's the eraser I use when I'm sketching.
What was that?
What did you say?
Oh, that's funny. She says that's the eraser she...
Huh? What?
Not so high on your left string.
Faster. One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Careful. They are virgins.
The applause is deafening.
Applause? I don't hear any.
I've been having a little trouble with my ears lately, though.
I took some pills for it but they didn't work very well.
Well, probably you didn't put them in the right place.
Use your imagination.
Wood.
[ Loud scream! ]
Stop .. stop ..
What you do?
You stay home!
Bring down the curtain.
I'll teach you. You come home at once.
Fedor! Fedor, what you do?
Fedor!
Come back here, I tell you.
Come back here.
Fedor. Come back here.
Fedor. I'll break every bone in your body.
You devil!
Where do you hide from me?
If he is, the devil must be a mountain goat.
He runs just like one, doesn't he.
At least I imagine he does.
I've never met a mountain goat personally.
Oh, what legs he has for dancing.
Look at him .. like a deer.
Where are you going, you good-for-nothing?
Come back here! I charge you!
Quick. Out of sight with him.
Fedor.
I'll break every bone in your body.
Fedor .. Fedor!
Good evening.
Where goes that boy?
What boy?
He just ran in. You must have seen him.
I'm sorry. Karimsky.
Yes, sir?
Have you seen a strange boy around here tonight?
Tonight? No.
On Friday night there was a strange boy.
He was quite an old fellow though.
We've seen no boy. You must be mistaken.
He's here, I tell you.
Oh, my dear friend. Look for yourself.
He's away from home. With what?
Hidden him safely?
I'll be lucky if I can find him again myself.
He must be some place.
Ah, but my friend, there are so many places.
Fedor. Fedor. Fedor!
Come to me. Where are you?
I'll kill you when I find you.
What the devil are we going to do with that boy?
Pack up quick! We get out.
Bring me that.
Here.
Quick.
Simon!
- Yes, Vladimir.
Hitch up the horses.
Come on. Your fingers are like feet.
Close it up.
Now go to sleep, Fedor.
Go to sleep. Don't worry about anything.
Yes, not a bad name for a dancer.
A dancer?
- That's what I said.
Nature fashioned him for that.
Thighs like steel, yet plastic.
That's the body I should have had.
With my soul.
A dancer's soul.
The heritage of my mother.
- Your mother?
Ah, you never saw her dance.
Like a bit of thistle-down.
She used to say to me "Ivan .. "
"You have more than I.
You have the genius."
Genius? Pah!
It's been a curse to me.
A nightmare.
Twist my dreams with torment.
It's strange you know ..
The dream I always had.
Ever since I was a little boy.
A great, shining figure.
White and beautiful.
Would come to me with wings.
Big, shimmering wings.
And put them on my back.
And beckon me.
And when I start to fly.
Oh, so happy.
My heart would almost break.
A great claw ..
Grasped my foot.
Pulled me down.
Down into the swamp.
Black, bubbling.
And I'd scream and wake.
Aye, it was a very pretty little dream.
You give me the creeps when you talk like that, Ivan.
Yeah, I make my own blood run cold my friend.
When I think of what I might have been.
And what I am.
Making little wooden dolls dance.
For simple peasants.
And I should be ..
Don't look like that, Ivan.
Have you ever heard of the Golem?
Made of mud.
And given a human soul.
Of Frankenstein.
The monster created by man.
Or the homunculus.
The pale being. The product of science.
These are all dreams.
Brought to life by mortals.
I will create my own being.
That boy.
That boy will be my counterpart.
He shall be what I should have been.
I will mould him.
I will poor into him my genius.
My soul.
In him, all my dreams ..
All my ambitions ..
Will be fulfilled.
I will make him.
The greatest dancer of all time.
Stop! Time.
Wrong, wrong. Do it all over again.
You are out of line. The effect is lost.
Come on.
It is all wrong!
We have to do it all over again.
Just what I would have said.
You've got to watch that there, with the way you've got those ..
Lines .. all crooked.
Do it all over again. You want to want to watch that rhythm, too.
Ahh!
Now, bear that in mind.
Ready.
One .. two ..
I beg your pardon, sir.
Count Renaud is here.
I hope I'm not disturbing you, Tsarakov.
My dear friend, you are far too rich ever to disturb anybody.
Sit down.
That premier dancer of yours hardly shares your opinion, I'm afraid.
Every time I come here to the theatre lately, he watches me like a cat.
You mean Fedor?
- Look at him now.
He's stopped dancing.
- Why shouldn't he?
It's the end of his number.
That wasn't the case last night.
He stopped right in the middle of the show.
Oh, he's nervous my friend. You don't understand the artistic temperament.
If you had seen him ten years ago, you'd say it was a miracle.
Just a disjointed little bag of bones.
- Really?
Nothing to recommend him at all ..
But his mad ambition to dance.
I made that ..
Magnificent specimen you see there.
Just as surely as God made this world.
That little girl over there.
Nana Carlova.
She's worthwhile.
Hmm. But a little beyond anyone's reach I'm afraid.
Oh, that reminds me my dear friend.
She .. wishes to return your gift.
Oh. Didn't she like it?
She's not used to getting such expensive presents.
They frighten her.
Besides, the design is very crude, my friend.
Something more simple, maybe?
There could be nothing more simple.
Than giving diamond bracelets to Nana Carlova.
I have no sentimental value.
For Nana's virtue, but ..
As it happens, she is reserved for Fedor.
Fedor?
- Hmm.
He seems to like her, so I have arranged that he shall have her.
Just as I've arranged that he should have every other woman he wanted.
I don't understand you, Tsarakov.
My dear Count.
An artist must have his relaxation.
He must be inspired by many beautiful women.
Nana! Your cue.
Don't stand around and gab. Your cue.
What an old wolf you are.
Suppose he falls in love with one of those beautiful women?
For a man like you, there is nothing wrong with it.
For an artist, it is fatal.
He must have his whole soul, his whole being in his art.
Nothing else.
Nana seems to take up a great deal of his time.
As long as he's happy, I'm satisfied.
Don't disturb him, my friend.
Then I suppose, I am just to burn up with desire.
There are so many other ladies, my dear Count.
To the devil with the other ladies.
That's exactly what I am suggesting.
But not Nana Carlova.
Fedor, please.
Let's go.
Good evening, Maestro.
You're a hard worker, huh?
- Thanks.
You are new, aren't you?
I haven't seen you about.
What's your name?
- Olga Chekova.
Ah.
You want to be a ballet dancer?
Yes.
Do you want to be a great ballet dancer?
Yes.
Come to my office. Three o'clock.
Oh no! What are you doing here?
Standing around?
Come back to your places. Quick!
We'll have to do it again.
What's the matter, Serge?
You look tired.
- Oh ..
Nana .. you're the only one that worries about me.
The others drive me crazy.
Look at them. Stepping on each other's feet while they are dancing.
I'm going mad. I tell you,
I cannot stand it any longer.
Oh now, Serge. Don't take it so hard.
You'll be alright. I know you will.
Oh ..
My Nana.
Go on. Take your place.
Dancers .. one .. two.
Ivan.
Will you see me for a moment?
If it isn't taking up too much of your time.
How can you treat me like this?
Aren't you human at all?
Is it impossible that you forget that I once took advantage of your propinquity?
You made me think you cared once.
If you hadn't done ..
I know. You never would have made your first false step.
The music cue.
I know the truth now.
I meant no more to you than ..
Than that chair.
Well .. that was once a very comfortable chair, probably.
And you could always sit in the chair afterwards.
Come darling. Run away or Serge will bite you.
No good! There is something wrong!
Oh, I can't stand it.
Hey!
What's the matter with you?
- They are no good.
The whole morning, everyone has done as they pleased.
Why, you fool. I've been directing them myself.
They were working like the devil.
What's the matter with you?
Are you crazy?
I cannot wait for tonight.
I must have some more. Now!
I have none here.
- It is a lie.
I know you always have some on you in case I ..
No!
I haven't slept since the rehearsals started.
They keep going around in my head.
The people moving.
The music, the dancer's feet.
Until I feel as though, every nerve in my body had a voice that was screaming.
How can I stand it unless you give me all I need?
Not in the theatre.
- Then I cannot go on.
I cannot think with that terrible sensation of screaming.
No sound. Still that sensation of screaming.
Shush!
I cannot go on. Please ..
Quiet ..
Everything is fine, yeah.
Get ready. Let's go!
One .. two ..
Thanks Karimsky.
I appreciate your suggestions.
That's alright, Fedor.
In fact, I'm utterly satisfied ..
With the analytical and psychological construction of your work in the ballet.
However, there in the second act of Cleopatra.
You know, when you leap through the window?
Well .. leap a little higher and ..
Make sure that the window is open when you leap through there.
I will.
I'm fully convinced though, Fedor.
That your greatest achievement will be in the ballet story that I've written.
I'd like to have you read that.
Anything important?
There is another letter from the mother of that girl in Vienna.
Personally, I think ..
- Personally, you can't think!
Put it in a file with the others.
Well how are you Fedor?
How do you feel, huh?
Alright.
You sound tired.
Maybe you were out late last night, huh?
- I was. With Nana.
Aha .. well?
You heard what I said: well?
Nana isn't like that.
She's very different.
Different .. well that sounds wonderful. Tell me about it.
That isn't what I mean.
Nana has an innocence. A sweetness.
Ah.
You know, I can think of nothing more revolting.
Than a human being licking envelopes.
Post them.
And take a brisk walk.
You look terrible.
I don't believe I'll walk very much.
My feet hurt me today.
Get out.
An amazing character.
Well, everything alright, Fedor?
I wouldn't change places with anyone on earth.
Ah, that's good to hear, my son.
Real gratitude. Very rare.
Oh, it isn't just gratitude.
It's much more than that.
I owe everything I have and am, to you.
Why you .. you've been a father to me.
You can be one of the greatest artists ..
In the world.
What more can anyone ask?
Nothing.
Right .. you are right.
Have ..
Have I ever been wrong in my dealing with anything that ..
Concerns your happiness?
- No. Never.
Then what was the matter last night?
Why did you make that long pause?
I just found out. It was Count Renaud.
As he came in the box just now I had the same feeling I had on stage last night.
Only this time I knew what it was. I hate that man.
What for?
He seems to think he has only to look at any girl and she will ..
Well, unfortunately they do.
Any number of them have.
- But not Nana Carlova.
Wouldn't you think that even he could see that she's different?
Ah, you seem very sure for one so young.
How many times have I told you never to place any woman too high?
It always saves so much fuss when ..
Things grow stale.
Here, have a drink.
- No, thank you.
You will like it. It's very good.
I just got it from Bavaria.
Thanks.
- Sit down. Sit down.
I .. I don't wish to pry into your private affairs, my son.
But ..
Just what do you and Nana mean to each other?
We've always been friends.
Hmm.
Oh, that's an amiable relationship.
As far as it goes.
But it's a little childish when it interferes with your work, isn't it?
I admit I've been worried about her.
Since she is above temptation.
What harm can Count Renaud do her?
If she isn't .. then she's scarcely worthwhile worrying about, is she?
But she is above it.
Well, in that case Renaud is automatically eliminated, isn't he?
Huh?
Why ..
Well, of course.
I believe you could clear up anything.
Now I must get back to work.
Alright, boy. Oh, by the way.
I want you to come to supper with me tonight, after the performance.
I want you to meet a charming little recruit.
No thanks.
I think I'd better go home.
Hello.
Friedrichshafen neun sieben.
Hello? Hello, is that you, Renaud?
You just got home, huh?
I've just been talking to a little friend of yours.
Nana Carlova. She just went out.
I know. I've changed my mind about that.
I tell you what you do.
Send her back the bracelet, huh.
And attach a little bunch of violets to it.
You know. It is modest, sweet, simple.
She likes simple things.
Don't give up the ship, Renaud.
Remember the battle has just begun, huh.
Alright. Not at all.
Not at all, my friend.
Stage manager.
Send Olga Chekova in my office.
By the way.
The man at the store says there's something wrong with the letters.
What?
We have to put stamps on them.
Now you have a little time, I'd like you to read the ballet story I've written.
I would rather have you lick envelopes.
[ Door knocks ]
Come in.
Take off your hat.
- I was just thinking of that.
Come in. Come close.
But it isn't three o'clock.
Yes, the time is alright.
Don't be nervous. Sit down.
Sit down. I have something very important I want to tell you.
Yes?
Someone is very much interested in you.
Yes .. who?
Fedor.
- Fedor?
Why, he's hardly ever looked at me.
He will.
Listen.
Why, you are here early.
You are a hard little worker, huh?
Well .. was I right about Fedor?
No .. not exactly.
Oh my dear child. Don't be embarrassed in front of me.
I understand these things.
I went to his room, as you told me.
- Yes?
I knocked on his door.
- Yes.
He came to the door and I did what you told me to.
Yes, yes.
He laughed in my face.
No.
He did.
I think you were playing a joke on me, Maestro.
No, my dear child.
The joke was on him.
Come to my office tomorrow at three o'clock.
Ah .. make it two-thirty.
You'll take me seriously one day.
I must hurry and get dressed.
Goodbye, darling.
Hurry up.
- Hmm .. I will.
Get Serge.
Serge isn't here. At least I haven't heard anyone yelling.
What do you mean "he isn't here"?
On opening night?
He must be here, you fool.
I am here.
Even you are here. Go get him.
Count Renaud sent you these violets.
- Count Renaud?
Aren't they lovely?
Yes .. they're every pretty.
You know me, this is our opening night.
I am very nervous, I am very busy.
I cannot spare one minute.
Sit down. I want you for something.
Don't be nervous. Don't be nervous.
Get me out a Form Of Release.
Two copies.
Take down this letter.
Address it to me.
My dear Director.
I send you this letter tonight.
So that you may consider it carefully.
Before you interview me tomorrow.
I believe Nana Carlova ..
Has a very pretty talent.
But the role that she is at present rehearsing.
Is far beyond her capabilities.
Her experience of life.
Is perhaps too limited.
For her to invest ..
The part with the requisite sophistication.
And it is absolutely vital to the success of the ballet.
That we replace her with someone else.
That's all. Leave it unsigned.
I hope she doesn't recognise my typewriting.
Go to Nana Carlova's dressing-room.
Tell her to come to my office as soon as she has her costume on.
And wait outside, please.
What was that you just dictated?
This is the letter you sent me this evening.
I .. ?
You know very well I never wrote such a thing.
You must have. Here it is.
And I've decided to follow your advice.
Preskoya dances Carlova's role beginning with tonight's rehearsal.
After her performance.
Sign it, please.
No .. you cannot make me do this.
I've already told you I wasn't quite sure of Carlova's work.
And this letter from you verifies my judgement.
Sign in.
- No! I tell you, no!
No?
- No.
What are you going to do?
That depends entirely on you, my friend.
No ..
In a second.
There will be no more of this ever again.
If you permit me to drop this in the fire.
You're the devil.
The devil!
Or an angel, perhaps?
Who is giving you a chance to redeem yourself.
Why do I carry this filthy stuff at all?
Because you feel you can't live without it.
And I need you in my work.
If I drop this.
You will be free.
Oh, you will suffer of course.
But in the end ..
You will be happier than you could ever dream.
Drop it.
No, no, no!
If I put this back in my pocket.
You must pay for it.
Put it back.
Ah, my poor friend.
You know it is an ill wind that blows nobody any good.
Go tell Preskoya the news.
[ Door knocks ]
Come.
Ah my dear child. Come in.
Come in.
My, how sweet you look.
That's very becoming.
- Oh. Thanks.
Sit down, dear. Sit down.
Nana?
Nana!
But I .. I don't understand.
Serge has always been so nice to me.
But why shouldn't he be, my dear Nana?
He likes you, as we all do.
But he is first of all, an artist.
But .. you are not going to take me off?
My dear child, what can I do?
I hate to appear unjust or cruel.
But in these circumstances.
I'm afraid I will have to ask you to give up your role, Nana.
You .. you mean?
That after all I've ..?
- Listen.
I intend to save you every possible mortification.
Our contract is dissolved by mutual consent.
No-one need ever know that you didn't leave us.
Because of other plans.
But .. where will I go?
Well, I hate to advise people, my dear.
It seems to me that ..
You have the best chance of success possibly by ..
Placing yourself somewhere where ..
Only youth and beauty ..
Are necessary.
You mean .. Count Renaud?
My dear child .. I am not so inhuman.
That I would close one career to you.
Without .. opening up another.
But .. but, Fedor?
Fedor is like my son.
Bound to me by the great future I have planned for him.
There is no room in his life for anyone ..
Who jeopardises that.
You ..
Haven't been foolish enough to fall in love with him, have you?
Answer me. Have you?
Does he reciprocate your feelings?
Has he ever spoken to you at all .. of love?
No.
But I know he cares.
In that case, if you love him at all.
If you really love him.
You will go away.
And not murder the career of a genius.
But what about .. me?
Ah ..
I said those same words once.
And the woman I said them to laughed in my face.
It at least enabled me to find myself.
My dear Nana.
You must laugh in Fedor's.
Oh but I .. but if I ..?
- Here.
Here is the release.
Will you sign it my child?
Do you really believe in Fedor's future?
Oh yes, indeed I do.
- Then you will sign it.
Believe me, what I'm asking you, Nana.
I know it's the best for the both of you.
Here.
Trust me.
Ah, that's a brave girl.
A brave girl. I'm proud of you.
Now, where is your contract?
In my trunk.
- Just destroy it.
Destroy it my dear.
Here. Here is the release signed by me.
In case you wish again to take up dancing.
How could I?
Oh my dear child. In a new life.
New surroundings, new interests.
In a little while you will smile at all this.
And you know, you are very pretty when you smile.
Nana, wait a minute.
Help me out, please.
- No. I won't let you go away. I ..
So you listened.
I overheard enough to know I had a right to listen.
I love you, Nana.
That's all that matters now.
You mustn't ..
I don't want you to love me.
- Nana.
No!
- Nana.
Fedor!
Let her go, my son.
If she goes, I go.
Ah, don't be a fool, Fedor.
If only you hadn't listened.
It makes so much more for us to wipe out.
How can you wipe out love?
Women seem to have found a way.
There isn't a woman alive ..
Who wouldn't deceive and hurt the man who loved her.
Nor the man she loved .. for a price.
You may think that's true, but you can't make me believe it.
Must you find it out for yourself, my son?
Don't you understand? I only want to save you from suffering.
How can you say that?
After what I just heard behind that door.
I worshipped you.
As some people worship an idol.
You were my father and God in one.
Do you think it didn't hurt to find you cruel, and ruthless?
You had no right to break Nana's heart.
To kill all her hope in her work.
Ah, what is her work, but part of the setting for you?
I could get a thousand "Carlovas".
There is only one "Fedor".
Who made him?
I made you.
I recreated myself as I wanted to be.
I'm a very jealous God.
Who's risen from a hell of his own through you.
You didn't know that ..
When I was four, I couldn't walk.
When I was six ..
I could hobble about.
With a little crutch.
That crutch made my mother hate me.
My mother.
The premier danseuse at the Imperial Russian Ballet.
One day, she didn't come home.
No, she didn't go away with my father.
The Grand Duke Ivan.
My birth to him was just a pleasantry.
A little accident.
I never saw her again.
But she left me one heritage.
The mad desire to dance.
With an iron brace to hold me from it.
Like a vice!
Don't you see I'm living the life
I couldn't live, through you?
Who haven't got this ..
Useless thing of flesh and bone.
That my mother hung on me.
You think you owe me nothing?
Your very life is mine.
And if I give it up, I lose my own.
I am you .. and you are me.
Just as though we were one being.
If you had only told me this before.
But don't you understand?
Until tonight, I would gladly have cut off my right hand had you asked it.
But now ..
Something has happened inside of me.
When I heard you .. lying .. scheming.
Cruel.
- No.
I only did it to save you.
I love Nana Carlova.
You cannot control that.
I will control it!
My whole life's work to be ruined.
On account of this doll-faced little fool.
You are the marionette that dances to my will.
I pull the strings.
- But you forget one thing.
This marionette has a heart.
Blood in its veins.
You didn't think about that, did you?
Well, now you know.
Nothing matters to me but Nana. My love for her is stronger than you, Tsarakov.
Ah, you young fool!
What can you do without me?
You are a puppet! A piece of clay.
You can't think. You can't move.
Unless I direct it!
You think so? We'll see.
Fedor!
Fedor, Fedor. You are not dressed.
Time for your cue.
You'll be on in a minute.
- I'm not going on.
Oh, the pity of it.
Karimsky! Bring down the curtain.
How are you this morning?
Are you going to sing for me? Come on.
Going to sing for me?
That's a good birdy.
Morning.
- Oh, Fedor.
Open this door.
Oh, what lovely flowers.
- Nah, nah.
I went all the way to Matelan for these.
They're going to cost you something.
I know. A kiss.
There.
Listen, Fedor. Listen.
Who can keep from singing on a morning like this?
Oh, I love Paris. It's so beautiful.
I never want to leave.
- It's going to be wonderful.
Fedor. Are you really happy?
Why, of course.
I'm so happy, I could dance forever .. I'll show you.
What are you doing? Put me down!
Let me down!
- That's how happy I am.
I will not let you down. I'm going to hold you like this for 2 years anyway.
Now, kiss me.
- Oh.
Something is burning.
It's the breakfast!
- Who cares?
I have to. Come on.
- No. I don't want any breakfast anyway.
[ Russian music ]
How is that Ivan, huh?
Wonderful, darling. Wonderful.
Same old Olga.
Same old Sonya.
- It's like old times, huh?
Preskoya never changes.
Wait .. please, no more now.
Wait, wait.
I'll be back in a moment.
Karimsky, my old friend. Come here.
Come here. Sit down.
I'm glad to see you. Have a drink.
No, wait. We'll wait for some fresh Champagne .. Preskoya!
Bring some fresh Champagne.
Do you know, it's funny your coming here like this, Karimsky.
I was just thinking about you.
Do you know, I've been looking for you all night. All over town.
I'm glad you found me, my old friend.
We talk about old times, huh?
Have a drink.
We wait for the fresh Champagne.
You know ..
I've been thinking a lot about you lately, Karimsky.
And I'm going to raise your salary.
I know. You've been overworking.
Perhaps you need a holiday?
Huh?
From now on.
You have Fr 87.50 a month.
Probably just a few days in the country will fix you right up again.
There is another thing
I want to tell you.
That suit.
You know that suit you wear in the daytime, every day, all the time?
It isn't becoming to you, Karimsky.
You look like a wet string-bean in it.
You get another suit. I pay for it.
Perhaps now you'll have a minute to hear the story I wrote for the next ballet.
I love to hear it, Karimsky.
I've been waiting to hear your story.
Tell me about it.
Well, the story takes place in Spain.
All the girls are dancing with shawls.
On account of it taking place in Spain, it would be good to have Spanish shawls.
Well, the music is playing.
It's Spanish music.
That is on account of the scene taking place in Spain.
A Spaniard and his girl walk in over here.
He says "Hello" and the girl says "I suppose so".
It gets into a pretty hot argument there.
Oh, then he turns to her and he says:
Well, you go to your church and I'll go to mine.
That clears up that part of it.
This fellow here with the pearl-grey derby, he hasn't said anything.
He's just standing there, see.
He walks forward and takes of this pearl-grey derby.
And from thirty to forty pigeons fly out.
That gives the audience an idea that anything could happen from now on.
Now.
During this time, the girls are dancing in front of these little Spanish shawls.
They're dancing there with Spanish music.
But in the centre, there is a very large shawl.
You keep wondering, what on earth could be behind that large shawl.
Well, the girls keep dancing behind these little shawls.
And some men come in, and they take away that big shawl.
And you discover what was behind that shawl .. is a girl, too.
But it's a big girl.
Well, that completes the ballet.
Personally, I think it teaches a great lesson.
It's incredible.
It's unbelievable.
That there should be any human being living.
Who is such a stupid ass.
I like it.
What are you doing here anyway?
Well, I brought you the contract.
What contract?
You know. Fedor's contract.
I found it in the trunk as you said.
Yes.
Leave that alone.
- I'll wait for fresh Champagne.
Get out.
Go away.
Oh, pertaining to that raise in salary.
Does that start this month?
Huh?
What are you talking about?
Have you gone crazy?
Get out before you're fired.
There's a possibility he's been drinking.
Wait.
Get me my coat.
Ivan! Ivan, wait a minute.
Where are you going?
We were going to have some more wine.
Ivan .. Ivan!
Look what you're doing.
- I know what I'm doing.
Mind your coffee.
- What?
Say, this was a fine breakfast.
I want you to promise me that ..
Well, what's the matter?
- Oh, I don't know.
I'm almost afraid.
Well, what's there to be afraid of, as long as we've got each other?
That's right, dear. Now come and eat your breakfast, and hurry.
No, I'm finished. I've had plenty.
What time is your rehearsal?
How can I remember anything when you look so adorable?
Oh, don't tease me, Fedor.
Drink your milk and hurry.
- There is plenty of time.
You know, Fouché's ballet is the best in Paris.
I was lucky to get the contract.
- And so was Fouché.
You will be a bigger star than you ever were in Berlin.
Thank you, darling.
Now come on, you must dress.
- Alright, dear.
Goodbye, darling.
I'll see you tonight.
- Alright, dear.
I'll come home after rehearsals.
- Best of luck.               - Thanks.
Nana.
- Yes.
Don't burn the dinner.
- Oh no ..
Paragraph one.
Martinelli Agents. Rue Blondelle. Paris.
This is to inform you ..
That Fedor Ivanoff ..
Is under exclusive contract to me for the next eight years.
It is absolutely impossible for him to appear under any other management.
Paragraph.
Circulate in Paris.
The International Agency of New York.
Genaro, Rome.
Artist's Agency, London.
I'll put him back in the mud.
Where I got him from.
Also send this to Klauber, Vienna.
Say, I have seen this Fedor Ivanoff.
He is a great dancer.
Yes.
Such is life. Here today, gone tomorrow.
Here. Take the strip over to Tsarakov.
Come on now, snap into it.
Wait a minute. Whoa. Hold it, Louis.
Terrible.
For the love of Mike, what do you call that?
If you ever did that over in Jersey they'd give you a barrage effect.
And they told me you were a dancer.
Well, I try. But ..
I don't understand.
That's the trouble with you foreigners.
You have no idea of rhythm.
Get and eyeful of real rhythm.
Go ahead, Louis.
Watch that.
That's what you got to do.
Now try and get it.
And if you don't, you get the gate.
Come on, Louis. Let's go.
Da, de, da, da, de ..
Oh, baby.
[ Singing: ]
"You've got that charm, that certain charm."
"That makes young farmers leave the farm."
"Oh, oh red-hot Mama."
"Do-de-do. Boopy doop. Red-hot Mama."
Nana.
- Yes, sweet?
Why .. I must have fallen asleep.
Been home long?
- Just came in this minute.
Tired, dear?
- Not now.
Your skin feels hot and dry.
Like a fever .. you should see a doctor.
You are all the doctor I need.
Why do you play at being happy, Fedor?
I understand, dear.
He is here.
Tonight ..
You should be dancing .. as a star.
But because of me, you're ..
- Nana! No, no ..
No.
Oh, I love you.
Oh, my darling.
That faraway look in your eyes always goes when you kiss me.
Do you want to kiss me so often because of that?
We mustn't talk like this.
The only way to be happy is to forget everything, but our love.
How can we forget Tsarakov?
Sometimes, I almost think I could admire him.
For the very power that should make me despise him.
Like some ignorant savage, before a hideous God.
Wanting to run, but staying to worship.
With his face in the mud.
- Fedor.
Your voice. The way you said that.
Why, it might have been Tsarakov.
Tsarakov?
Don't laugh like that! I've heard the same thing before.
As though you were suddenly him.
Tsarakov!
Fedor.
You are not going without your dinner.
Perhaps I had better begin to learn what starvation means.
Business has been very bad at the cabaret.
Fedor!
Name and address?
Nina La Vernier. Rue De Terriere.
Quarante-deux.
It's a little out of my neighbourhood, but I'll mark it down anyway.
Esmeralda O'Brien. Theatre Odeon.
Hey.
You're a foreigner, huh?
O'Brien?
- Uhuh.
And you want to be a ballet dancer?
- Yes!
You want to be a great ballet dancer?
- Yes!
Come to my office, three o'clock.
Oh ..
There is a lady to see you.
She says it's very important.
What's her name?
- Nana, Carlova.
Who?
- Nana Carlova.
Show her in my office.
Martinelli.
[ French language ]
Don't forget, three o'clock.
Make it four o'clock.
Ah .. my dear Nana.
You are surprised?
- Surprised?
I am delighted.
It warms my heart.
You haven't forgotten old Tsarakov, huh?
I read that the ballet was in Paris.
And so you came. I'm so glad.
Wouldn't you have been better pleased if someone else had come?
Oh, you mean Fedor?
Oh, poor Fedor.
Yes, I often think of him.
Is he still dancing?
Why ..?
Oh, I remember.
Oh, yes.
Too bad. Too bad.
Does it please you to hurt me that way?
What makes you think
I wish to hurt you, Nana?
You asked me that question, when all the time you know everything about Fedor.
Hmm.
Yes, as a matter of fact I do.
Fedor!
Dancing in the Montmartre Cabaret.
Who sent him there?
Why my dear child, you did.
Who made him break his contract?
You did.
How could I help his loving me?
Why did you come to see me, Nana?
I ..
I want you to .. take him back.
Hmm. Are you willing to give him up?
Give him up?
How else can I take him back?
But I love him.
Oh, you don't know what love means.
I think Fedor knows what it means.
He ought to by this time.
He sacrificed everything for it.
What have you sacrificed in return?
I can visualise your life together.
With Fedor as a grocer's clerk or a waiter.
Deadening his nerves with the excitement of your love.
No!
Using it as a drunkard uses liquor until there isn't any left.
No. No, stop.
Before such a thing.
I'll do anything. I'll go away.
Go away?
That would only make your image the size of a mountain.
To do him any good at all, you've got to tear yourself out of his heart.
What do you mean?
- Listen, my dear Nana.
You know the story of Camille, huh?
Why yes, of course.
- Play her role.
You mean .. another man?
That's an excellent remedy for a broken heart.
And Count Renaud is in Paris.
Renaud?
- Listen to me.
I am willing to purge my soul.
To sacrifice every element of decency and truth.
And push them in the mud.
To show the world this boy's genius.
You, who love him so.
What are you willing to do, huh?
He kissed me such a little while ago.
I feel his arms still around me.
Oh, it would be horrible.
- Ha! I can't argue with you.
He is in your hands.
- Wait!
I will go on one condition.
- There are no conditions.
Renaud is leaving tonight for Berlin.
You must leave with him openly.
But if I ..
- Listen to me!
Do you want to help this boy or not?
- Yes.
Then you will do what I tell you.
Don't cry. Sit down. Hello.
We'll help him out together. Hello?
Champs Elysée. Cent quarante-six.
Shush. Don't cry. Sit down.
We'll help him between us.
Hello, Renaud.
Shut up. Shush.
Hello? Yes. Tsarakov.
Shush.
I have something amusing to tell you.
Hush!
Aha? You are leaving tonight?
You don't want to travel alone do you? No.
Nana.
Nana!
Nana!
Nana.
What are you doing here?
You are late, Fedor.
She is gone.
What do you mean?
What I say. She has gone to Berlin.
With Count Renaud.
That's a lie.
You think I deliberately lie to you?
To see you suffer?
Haven't I told you there wasn't a woman alive ..
Who didn't have her price?
If she's gone with Renaud, you forced her to it.
You made her believe it was her duty.
Is there any power on earth that could make you treat her in such a fashion?
To leave without warning, with another woman?
Is there?
Answer me .. is there?
No.
But Nana loved me. I know it.
- I know.
And her price .. is to be rid of fear.
Fear of the day when you realize your mistake for yourself.
You think my ambition is small and mean.
But the force of it ..
Reaches to the stars!
The force of her love ..
Reaches only to Renaud.
Come, my son.
We've work to do.
We have work to do.
Ha-ha. This one is good.
Listen to this one, Nana.
It was their wedding night.
The timid bride knelt by the bedside saying her prayers.
The groom waited patiently beside her.
At last, she said:
"And now I lay me down to sleep."
And the groom said:
"Oh, yeah?"
Have you heard it?
Stop it. Stop it I tell you!
I can stand no more.
Serge.
You prance around like cows.
Serge. You expect me to appear with a herd like that?
But Fedor, what's wrong?
Ah, you sicken me.
Get out if you don't understand what I want.
Go on with it.
No good!
It's all wrong!
Tsarakov, where is Tsarakov?
Why do I have to endure such clowns?
And you!
- I know. I'm fired again.
Where is Tsarakov?
I cannot stand this any longer.
You want me, my son? What's wrong, huh?
I can't go on this way.
What do you want changed?
- Everything. Dismiss everybody.
I must have new people. New scenes.
I won't appear in this town.
But my dear son, the bills are up, the whole house is sold out.
Well, tear them down.
Call the tickets back.
I'll open the ballet in
Berlin or not at all.
But .. that is impossible.
Impossible? Nothing is impossible.
I must get away while I can breathe.
I've said all there is to say.
We open in Berlin.
Quiet, quiet.
What's going to happen?
Isn't he magnificent, huh?
What temperament .. what an artist.
What a genius, huh?
But don't pay any attention to him.
We open tonight as scheduled, of course.
Now, in your places. We do it all over again, to see what's wrong.
What are you doing here?
I lost my collar button.
Pah!
Concentration!
Go right through it when you're ready, Serge.
[ Door knocks ]
Come in.
Good morning, fair flower.
Oh, it's you, Robert. Good morning.
Gracious lady.
Deign to accept my humble gift.
Observe. They have been kissed by the dews of the morning.
Yet the blooms wait for the caress of your breath and the touch of your hand.
Once nestled in your bosom, they will again lift up their fairy heads.
And smile like the hope of heaven ..
On a field of grey.
Robert, you are very poetic this morning.
Oh no. It's just a song I heard at the Café Casanova.
Nevertheless it was thoughtful.
And the flowers are very lovely.
It's easy to think of you, my dear.
There it is .. that faraway look again.
What are you thinking of?
Tell me, Nana.
You don't really love me, do you?
What do you think?
I don't think you do.
Robert. You are the dearest, sweetest man in the world.
You've been simply wonderful.
- Yes, yes. I know, I know, I know.
Let's talk of other things.
By the way.
Did you know that Tsarakov is opening his new ballet here in Berlin next week?
I know. I read it in the paper.
You would like to see Fedor?
Did you think I couldn't guess that?
Look.
I've already reserved a box for the opening night.
Robert, you darling!
Yes, yes. Let's talk about the weather.
Isn't he marvellous? The greatest dancer in the whole world, that boy.
He'll even be greater when he appears in the story I've written.
Say, if you have a little time between now and the next fire.
I'd like to have you read this over.
The whole scene takes place in Spain.
Forget about it.
Morning girls. In your places.
All ready for the next act.
Fedor. Fedor!
Oh, my son you were great!
You were magnificent.
You drove them wild!
Keep it up. In this next act ..
You'll show them you are the greatest artist they've ever seen.
There isn't going to be any next act.
Ha? What do you mean?
I mean, I'm not going on. I'm through.
I saw her, Tsarakov.
Nana's out there.
I knew she was there before I saw her in the box.
What can she mean to you?
She belongs to Renaud.
I love her .. I've always loved her.
When I saw her in the box just now.
When I saw her face.
I knew that she loved me.
Ah .. you're excited my son.
The opening night.
I know now.
You've always tried to keep us apart.
That's why she left me in Paris.
You made her.
You forced her to leave me.
I was crazy to ever give her up.
I was crazy to trust you all this time.
I was weak.
But I'm not weak any longer.
I tell you I'm not going on.
I'm through.
Now listen to me.
For fifteen years.
I've devoted my entire life to you.
I've poured my soul, my brain, into you.
I've sacrificed everything in the world.
Everything, do you hear?
For your career.
I've lied ..
I've cheated ..
I've crushed ..
I've even crushed myself.
So that you should appear greater than I.
I thought I'd given you strength enough to rise above everything.
You haven't risen, you've fallen.
You're not strong.
You're weak.
But all of me is in you still.
All the strength I've poured into that weak soul.
So you can't fail me now.
If you fail me now.
I'll kill you.
I'll kill you.
Now, get on your clothes for the next act.
Don't you understand? It's the climax of our great career and all our work!
You young fool!
You can be a flame that will dazzle the world.
Come on.
Next act!
Last act!
In your places.
Places.
Places.
Dead ..
Plaster.
What are you doing? What you do?
Are you mad?
Look at it!
It is cardboard. It is plaster.
It is dead.
It should be alive.
It should be squirming with blood oozing from its veins.
It should be a human being.
You .. you are the Idol!
If you have any blood.
I don't need to look for it.
I've got it.
I've taken it.
Tsarakov!
Look .. it's Tsarakov!
Fedor.
Oh, Fedor!
Nana.
Fedor.
- Nana.
Kiss me.
Nana.
My darling.

Look!
- He's dead. His neck's broken.
- Ohh.
What's been going on here?
- Murder, my friend.
- Murder?
- Did you do this?
- No.
The body of the man who killed him lies in there.
- "Body"?
- You mean to say there's two of 'em?
- Oohh.
- Albert, keep an eye on this old cove.
I place him in your custody for the time being.
- I'd rather go with you.
- Chicken-hearted.
How do you expect to win your stripes?
I shan't run away.
[ Grumbles ]
- What was in there?
- A gentleman with a stake driven right through his heart.
- Ooh-ooh-ooh.
- Do you know anything about this?
Yes. I did it.
- Who is he in there?
- His name was Count Dracula.
How long's he been dead?
- About 500 years.
- Five--
Albert, hand me them handcuffs.
- Those won't be necessary, Constable.
- So you say.
One bloke a-weltering in his blood with a stake driven through his heart.
A gentleman lying here with his neck broke.
By the way, who is he?
- A poor, harmless imbecile who ate spiders and flies.
- 'Armless?
Whoa.
This is a case for Scotland Yard.
Come on.
I had no choice.
Naturally, I destroyed him.
Well...
I've heard a great many fantastic stories in my time, Professor Von Helsing...
- but, if you'll forgive my saying so, this one--
- I know.
But surely, surely, you can't expect to face an English jury with such a defence.
It's my only one, because it's true.
It's utterly mad!
"Mad," or unbelievable?
Oh, very well, in deference to your position in the scientific world, let's say "unbelievable."
The strength of the vampire, Sir Basil, lies in the fact that he is unbelievable.
Vampires, vampires-- oh, why do you persist?
Professor Von Helsing, would you mind explaining to me, as you must explain to your jury... just what you mean by "vampires"?
- The undead.
- "Undead"?
Creatures who have never died... who prolong their unnatural lives by draining the blood of the living.
At night, they leave their graves and roam abroad like wolves seeking their prey.
When daylight comes, they must return to their graves... or die.
And this Count Dracula is one of those-- those fabulous creatures?
Is that what you expect me to believe?
Yes, yes!
He came to England from his ancient castle in Transylvania. bringing with him boxes of earth from his native grave.
Using Carfax Abbey as his base, he descended upon London for fresh victims.
There were many mysterious attacks... each person found drained of blood.
I was able to trace those attacks to their source... locate Dracula's hiding place and drive that stake through his heart.
Professor, whom have you decided to retain for your defence?
There is only one man who might understand, my friend,Jeffrey Garth.
Garth? Why, Garth's not an advocate.
He's a psychiatrist.
He alone will understand.
Professor Von Helsing, you may, of course, use your own judgement... but I advise you to consider, carefully... you have admitted to killing a man in a very horrible manner-- by driving a stake through his heart.
That is the only way a vampire can be destroyed.
And, as head of Scotland Yard,
I must warn you... that there are only two courses which can be taken: either to formally charge you with murder and send you to the gallows... or to have you committed to an institution for the criminally insane.
Sir Basil, listen to me and believe me, I implore you.
In destroying the monster, Dracula,
I performed a service to humanity.
- Beg pardon, Sir Basil.
- Yes, yes, Squires, yes?
That constable's on the wire again, wants to know what's being done about the bodies.
What constable?
What bodies?
The constable at Whitby, sir, about the bodies of Count Dracula and the man Renfield.
Oh. Well, tell him I am sending for them this evening on the 10.00... and tell him to keep guard over them and let no one near them.
[ Clears Throat ]
I wish that bloke'd hurry up and get here from Scotland Yard so we could go home.
9.30. Hmm.
Better get started for the station.
- Right-o.
- Not you.
You heard orders.
Keep 'em under guard.
You don't mean to say you're gonna leave me here alone with them?
Someone's got to meet the train.
- That's etiquette, that is.
- All right, I'll meet the train.
After all, this is your jail.
You can't meet a sergeant from Scotland Yard.
You've no official standing.
- Oh. What's that?
- [ Scratching ]
- [ Scratching Continues ]
- I didn't hear nothing.
In there! Listen!
- Not a peep.
- You'd better have a look.
You heard the noise.
- You have a look.
- [ Clears Throat ]
Here. Take this.
[ Clears Throat ]
Oh!
- What is it?
- A rat.
There's never been no rats in Whitby jail.
There is now.
Here.
Give me that light.
I'll have a look.
Not a rat in sight.
You're worse than an old woman, you are.
[ Scratching ]
[ Shivers ]
Not a single rat... and nothing but two corpses.
I'd better be getting to the station.
Uh, here-- in case they get up and start walkin'.
- Who?
- Them corpses.
[ Stammers ]
And, Albert, remember...
England expects every man to do his duty.
Right.
[ Clears Throat ]
[ Door Rattles, Opens ]
- Are you in charge here?
- Yes, ma'am.
I've come to see the body of Count Dracula.
Sorry, ma'am, it ain't allowed.
- I must.
- Why?
To make sure that he's dead.
You'll have to take my word for it, ma'am.
- He is.
- Where is he?
- In there?
- Sorry, ma'am, you can't go in there.
It's against orders from Scotland Yard.
They'd never know if you didn't tell them.
Orders is orders.
What can I do to persuade you?
Can I offer you money?
I'd rather you wouldn't, ma'am.
Or something more precious than money?
Look.
You've never seen a jewel as beautiful as this... nor as compelling.
You will remember nothing.
Well, here we are, Sergeant.
What about a little drop of the "all right," just to keep the chill off the bones?
- Where've you got the bodies?
- In there.
Albert, this is Sergeant Wilkes of His Majesty's Scotland Yard.
Well, well.
Where's your manners?
What's the matter, lad?
What is it, lad? What's the matter?
Wake up! Wake up!
- Sergeant!
- Here, something's happened to him!
- There's only one body in there.
- What?
See for yourself.
- He's gone!
- Who?
- Count Dracula.
- But you were--
[ Howling ]
[ Howling ]
Unto Adonai and Azrael... into the keeping of the lords of the flame and lower pits I consign this body... to be forevermore consumed in this purging fire.
Let all baleful spirits that threaten the souls of men be banished... by the sprinkling of the salt.
Be thou exorcised, O Dracula... and thy body, long undead... find destruction throughout eternity in the name of thy dark, unholy master.
In the name of the all holiest, and through this cross... be the evil spirit cast out until the end of time.
Free-- free forever.
Do you understand what that means,
Sandor? Free to live as a woman-- free to take my place in the bright world of the living...
- instead of among the shadows of the dead.
- Perhaps.
- What do you mean?
- This night is almost gone.
Who knows what another will bring?
Quick. We must be in
London before dawn.
- The night is here.
- Why are you looking at me that way?
I'm remembering last night... and waiting.
You think this night will be like all the others, don't you?
Well, you're wrong. Dracula's destroyed.
His body's in ashes. The spell is broken.
I can live a normal life now, think normal things. even play normal music again.
Listen.
[ Plays Lullaby ]
A cradle song-- a song my mother once sang to me long, long ago...
- rocking me to sleep as she sang in the twilight.
- Twilight.
Quiet. Quiet.
You disturb me.
Twilight-- long shadows on the hillsides.
- Evil shadows.
- No.
No, peaceful shadows... the flutter of wings in the treetops.
The wings of bats.
No.
No, the wings of birds.
From far off, the barking of a dog.
Barking because there are wolves about.
- Silence! I forbid you!
- "Forbid"?
- Why are you afraid?
- I'm not.
I'm not.
I found release!
- That music doesn't speak of release.
-  [ Accelerating ]
No. No!
You're right!
That music tells of the dark-- evil things, shadowy places.
- Stop. Stop! Stop!
-  [ Stops ]
Sandor, look at me.
What do you see in my eyes?
Death.
[ Door Slams ]
Hurry. Hurry, it's almost daylight.
There's blood on it again.
When did he have the last transfusion?
About four hours before he died.
What do you think caused his death?
An unnatural loss of blood which we've been unable to determine.
If we only knew what caused those two sharp punctures over the jugular vein.
Well, at any rate, a good tramp over the moors and the smell of the heather... may help me forget London and case histories of neurotic ladies.
[ Brogue ] Aye, but remember:
You're not here to doctor the birds, but to shoot them.
There are a few "birds" in London I'd like to shoot, and they haven't feathers either.
- [ Both Chuckle ]
- All right,Jock.
[ Horn Honking ]
It's my assistant,Janet Blake.
I left her in London with orders to forget where I'd gone.
-Jeffrey!
- Well, what in the name of--
Excuse me.
- Well, what do you want?
- You. Come on. Get in.
- You're going back to London.
- Oh, no. I have an appointment with several grouse.
You have an appointment with Scotland Yard.
What for?
I haven't killed anybody.
No, but a friend of yours has-- a man named Von Helsing.
Von Helsing? Professor Von Helsing?
He's in Budapest.
No, he's in London.
He needs help badly.
They tried to reach you here by phone yesterday, and ended by my planing to Edinburgh... and driving from there all night.
- I'm in no mood for an argument!
- Jeffrey, we've barely time to reach the positions.
- Miss Blake, Mr Graham.
- How do you do?
You'll have to forget about me.
Got to dash back to London.
Here, Angus. I knew I had no business buying it in the first place. Keep it for next year.
Besides, I don't trust myself with it at the moment.
- Forgive his bad manners, Mr Graham.
- Never mind my bad manners!
- I'll drop you a line. Good shooting!
- Goodbye.
Just because you're a baronet's daughter, you take liberties an ordinary secretary wouldn't think of.
The ordinary secretary wouldn't have intelligence enough to think of it.
[ Scoffs ] Well, you're driving.
Go ahead.
You want them to hang the man before we get there?
I'm a psychiatrist,
Professor, not a lawyer.
I'd do anything in the world to help you, but what?
You must convince them of my sanity.
If I do that, they'll hang you for murder.
You can't murder a man who's been dead for five centuries.
Talking like that won't help.
When you were a student under me in Vienna,Jeffrey, you had a far more open mind.
My mind is just as open as it ever was, Professor... but it's a scientific mind, and there's no place in it for superstitions.
Superstition?
Who can define the boundary between the superstition of yesterday... and the scientific fact of tomorrow?
In the history of your own profession, psychiatry... a century before, hypnosis was looked up as black magic.
Today it is accepted as commonplace, even used in anaesthesia.
What would have happened to a man a hundred years ago... who advanced the present-day theories of the subconscious?
Oh, I know, I know.
Do you, as an intelligent scientist, dare to dismiss as superstition... the principles underlying
Tibetan magic...
- voodooism, thought transference...
- No.
- Well, there you are.
- Oh, wait, Professor, wait.
Arguments of this sort are all right in academic circles.
You're up against stern reality.
You can't defend yourself by quoting folklore.
There isn't a jury in England that will believe you... and, if I had the most brilliant legal mind in the world,
I couldn't make them.
Then I must stand alone,Jeffrey.
No, Professor. I'll help you.
I don't know how. I haven't the faintest idea where to start.
But I'll stake my reputation against the facts... if there's a way to clear you, I'll do it.
Who did this?
A Hungarian. She just arrived in London a few weeks ago.
- She's charming.
- What's her name?
Countess Marya Zaleska.
Excuse me,Jeffrey.
My dear, how sweet of you to come.
Don't you know it's very rude to stare at strangers?
Thought I'd gotten rid of you for a while.
Not while there's a dangerous-looking brunette like that around.
You know, my guests are dying to meet you.
Countess Zaleska,
I want you to know Jeffrey Garth...
- one of my most intimate friends.
- How do you do?
And Janet Blake... who doesn't like your painting very much.
- No.
- Oh, he doesn't like it, either.
He says that--
- Quiet.
- Sherry, Marya?
No, thank you.
I never drink... wine.
You didn't stay in Scotland long, did you,Jeffrey?
No. Didn't fire a shot... never even saw a grouse, thanks to Father's little helper here.
Oh, that Von Helsing thing.
I've been reading about it in the papers.
That vampire case?
Yes, the man who was known as Count Dracula.
Rum sort of thing.
Seems this fellow, Von Helsing... shoved a stake through this Dracula fellow's heart.
- Do you know him,Jeffrey?
- Mm-hmm. I studied under him.
- I owe most of my success to him.
- What are you going to do?
Well, I don't quite know yet.
One thing I'm pretty sure of... they won't press the murder charge.
They haven't been able to find Dracula's body.
Maybe one of his vampire friends flew in and spirited him away! [ Laughs ]
Well, strangely enough, Von Helsing takes his vampires quite seriously.
Why not? Possibly there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of... in your psychiatry, Mr Garth.
I'm sure we'd all be interested to know what modern science has to say about vampires.
Go on,Jeffrey.
But surely you don't believe that preposterous rot, old fellow, what?
But I believe in Von Helsing.
He's gone much deeper into these things than most of us.
Perhaps he's taken them too literally. Such researches can easily lead to obsession.
You mean like people imagining they're Napoleon?
More or less, and like any disease of the mind, it can be cured.
We have to discover what brought about the obsession in order to effect mental release.
- Release?
- Yes, release.
Sympathetic treatment will release the human mind from any obsession.
I'm-I'm interested in what you've been saying, Mr Garth.
I'm wondering if we might... talk about it one evening soon... just you and I.
I'd like to... very much.
You seem to be having quite a lot of trouble.
All I ask is a little cooperation from this blasted--
Ah-ah-ah.
Careful, Doctor. You know what you tell Lady Anstruther about high blood pressure.
Listen, it's after office hours.
Will you go home?
- I'm worried.
- Worried? About what?
- You, tonight.
- Why?
Oh, call it what you like.
All the same... you were the only person at
Lady Esme's party to whom she paid the slightest attention.
- Perhaps I'm intelligent.
- [ Scoffs ]
[ Giggles ]
But odds are you're not getting it tied for at least 40 minutes.
Well, you might help me.
I beg your pardon?
I said, will you tie this tie or won't you?
You just hated to ask me, didn't you?
Well, come on, come on, come on!
You know, really, Doctor,
I've never seen you in such a dither.
I must have underestimated the lady's attractions.
Still, I don't know what you'd do without me.
There.
Goodnight, Doctor.
Good hunting.
Hey!
- What is it, Dr Garth?
- Haven't you noticed?
I've been having tie trouble all evening.
[ Chuckling ]
It looks all right to me.
You know, this is the first woman's flat
I've been in that didn't have... at least 20 mirrors in it?
- I'm glad you're not your friend,
Professor Von Helsing.
- Why?
He'd probably attach some occult significance to my lack of mirrors.
- Occult?
- Well, I seem to remember an old Hungarian legend... that a vampire casts no reflection in a mirror.
[ Chuckles ]
And you being the lady in question?
- Yes, what is it?
- Telephone, for him.
In the hall, Dr Garth.
Thank you.
Yes, Dr Garth speaking.
Well, who is this? What do you want?
[ Affecting German Accent ] Please come right away. This is the zoo speaking.
The what? The zoo?
Ja. One of our elephants is seeing pink men.
All right, now. Now, listen to me,Janet.
This has gone far enough.
There's nothing funny about it.
I'm in the midst of a very serious--
- [ Laughing ]
- Hello!
I don't think that'll happen again.
May I have a cigarette?
Dr Garth...
I ask you here tonight because I need your help.
As a psychiatrist?
As a man of strength and courage.
Well, I'm afraid that places me at a disadvantage.
Do you believe that the dead can influence the living?
Well, in what way?
Could you conceive of a superhuman mentality influencing someone...
- from the other side of death?
- No.
- There is such a one.
- Mm-hmm. Well, go on.
Someone-- Something that reaches out from beyond the grave... and fills me with horrible impulses.
Well, how can I help you?
Use my brain, my will, for an instrument as he has used them, but for release.
- Your mind has the power to do that.
- No.
Your strength lies within yourself.
- Put it to a test.
- A test?
Well, for example--
You know what we do with alcoholics?
We give them liquor, make them sit for hours alone without touching it... make them meet their craving, beat it back-- that is, if they have the will to be free.
- I have.
- Then do this.
The next time you feel this influence, don't avoid it.
Meet it, fight it, score the first victory.
- That's the secret.
- Life against death... the strength of a human mind against the powers of darkness.
I'll help you.
You must. You must-- your strength against his.
Not another phone call.
A woman?
No, a man.
He says it's important.
Oh.
He can help me, Sandor.
This time I'm sure.
Now, look here. I'm tired of being annoyed after office hours.
If you don't stop calling me, I'll come over there and, regardless of your sex...
I'll smack you in the nose!
But... this is Dr Beamish!
Oh, yes.
It's Dr Beamish now, is it?
Well, Doctor, how would you like to go back to the zoo and find a nice empty cage?
I beg your pardon!
This is Dr Beamish of St. Mary's Hospital!
Oh-- Oh, I say, Doctor.
I'm profoundly sorry.
I-- You see, I-- What?
- I've called about Lady Anstruther.
- Oh.
I would like you to go and see her immediately.
That is, if you're in condition to do so.
Well, I'll-I'll come directly.
Right-o.
[ Exhales ]
Would you get my hat and coat, please?
- I'm sorry. I must leave immediately.
- Oh, no.
An obsession case I've been handling has become a bit violent.
But you don't understand.
You must hear me out tonight, now.
Come to see me at the hospital tomorrow afternoon about half past 4.00, hmm?
- I can't do that.
- Oh, but surely, if this is so vital to you--
But you don't understand.
It's-It's impossible.
Can you see me tomorrow at night?
Well, I'll let you know. I think so.
Goodnight, and don't worry.
Are we going out?
We're going to the studio.
Tonight I paint... and I will need a model.
- Wait.
- Leave me alone! I haven't done anything to anybody.
The river is cold and dark.
I know where there is warmth and food and money.
- I don't want your kind of money.
- My mistress is an artist.
She will pay you if you will pose for her tonight.
There's nothing to fear.
Come.
Don't be afraid, my dear.
It was him I wasn't so sure about, ma'am.
Make yourself comfortable over here.
- What's your name?
- Lili.
That's very pretty.
You have beautiful hands, but they're so white and bloodless.
They're cold, ma'am.
- You came here willingly?
- No, not at first.
- Do you know where you are?
- Yes, in Chelsea.
Have you ever seen me before?
No. No, I haven't.
Help yourself, Lili.
Have you ever modelled before?
- No, I haven't.
- I'm doing a study of a young girl's head and shoulders.
You won't object to removing your blouse, will you?
No, I guess not.
You can get ready behind that screen.
Thank you.
I'm ready now.
- I suppose you'll want these pulled down, won't you?
- Yes.
Finish your wine. It'll warm you.
Stand by the fire for a moment.
You mustn't catch cold.
Why are you looking at me that way?
Won't I do?
Yes, you'll do very well indeed.
Do you like jewels, Lili?
This is very old and very beautiful.
I'll show it to you.
I don't think
I'll pose tonight. I--
I think I'll go, if you don't mind.
Please don't come any closer!
[ Screaming ]
[ Siren Wailing ]
[ Policeman's Whistle Blowing ]
[ Bystanders Chattering ]
Can you think of one good reason you shouldn't be dismissed immediately?
Yes, an excellent one.
Of all the childish, thoroughly unpardonable impertinences--
Last night, those phone calls... causing me to tell the chief of staff to go back to the zoo.
Well, so he should. And who was responsible for my phone ringing... every half-hour, all night long?
I was. I told the nurse at the switchboard... to see that you didn't have a wink of sleep!
I thought as much. I only came down this morning to tell you... that you can look for a new assistant.
- My resignation.
- Accepted... with the most ineffable pleasure.
Excuse me, Dr Garth, but Dr Graham wants to know if you will see an emergency patient...
- in 32.
- What for?
An amnesia case.
Something quite unusual.
Unusual, eh?
- Get your notebook and come along with me.
- Oh, no. I'm leaving.
Don't quibble. Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[ Sighs ]
Oh!
Strange case here, Doctor.
We think it's quite hopeless.
Loss of blood, and apparent amnesia.
- What treatment?
- Two transfusions.
- Any response?
- Very little.
- It's not amnesia.
- What is it, then?
Posthypnosis.
What does that chart say?
"Picked up near Curzon St.
No signs of violence.
Rambling, incoherent talk.
Spoke of woman."
Woman? What woman?
What'd she say?
Something about blood; then she lapsed into unconsciousness... and we haven't been able to rouse her since.
I think you've done everything possible.
What about those marks on her neck?
- What marks on her neck?
- Two little punctures... near the jugular vein, like insect bites.
There.
Open that shade a little.
We must bring her out of this coma, if only for a few moments.
Give her adrenaline, and if she rallies, let me know instantly.
- Yes, Doctor.
- What do you think those marks mean?
I'd rather not say.... until I've had a chance to talk with the one man in London... who might explain them--
Professor Von Helsing.
The loss of blood.
The marks on the neck. Hmm.
I don't understand, gentlemen.
I don't see how it can be, but those are the marks of the vampire.
It becomes increasingly evident, owing to the disappearance of Dracula's body... and the subsequent evidence, that he isn't dead at all.
No vampire can survive the stake.
He may have given the appearance of death.
During the day the body lay at Whitby and come to life at night--
Oh, dash it all! You've got me talking this gibberish now.
Dracula had many victims,
Sir Basil... into whose veins he infused his own tainted blood... making them creatures like himself.
Hmm. Sounds very much to me as if you were trying to build up your own defence... if you'll forgive my saying so.
What about the man they found last Friday night... near the embankment?
"Marks: two small punctures, near jugular vein. Resembling pinpricks.
Swollen slightly.
Faint discoloration."
Exactly the same.
You must do something about these attacks, Sir Basil.
- There will be others.
- But of course there'll be.
People are always being attacked in a fog.
That doesn't prove that London is hagridden with vampires.
It's preposterous.
I think you two are trying to pull my leg.
Well, as soon as that girl's in a condition for a posthypnotic examination...
- we'll have something definite to go on.
- How soon will that be?
Tonight.
I'm using the Letelier test.
Find out where the attack took place, and you'll have your vampire.
Well, uh, how will I know whether it's a vampire in good standing... or just... another maniac?
There'll be a box of earth somewhere near at hand,Jeffrey-- a box of its own native soil-- to which the vampire must return at the end of each night.
And another thing:
- There will be no mirrors anywhere about.
- What?
Because a vampire casts no reflection in mirrors.
[ Scoffs ]
Well.
- Well! You might say, "Good evening."
- Good evening.
What are you doing here?
I thought you'd severed all connections with the hospital.
[ Sighs ]
I changed my mind.
I detest vacillating women.
Well, you might as well run along,Janet.
I'm examining that girl we looked at presently.
Tell Aubrey that
I may drop by later.
Who is going to tie your tie?
[ Chuckles ]
My dear child,
I've tied my own tie since I was 16... and if I should have any difficulty,
I'm quite sure that Miss Peabody--
Uh, Miss Peabody?
- Miss Peabody? Would you tie my tie, please?
- Yes, Dr Garth?
I-I'm not sure that I can--
Oh, come, come.
Anybody can tie a tie.
Miss Peabody... um, th-the short end loops over.
- Over.
- Oh, I see. Thank you!
Oh! Uh--
Oh, for goodness'sakes.
-Janet, I assure you--
- Quiet!
There.
Stout fellow.
- Is this--
- Perfect!
Well, why didn't you tie it this way last night? Janet?
- [ Door Slams ]
-Janet!
- Oh, good evening, Miss Blake.
Is Dr Garth here?
- I'm sorry. He's just left.
Oh.
May I go to supper now, Dr Garth?
[ Garth ]
Yes, yes. By all means. Go ahead.
Why was it necessary to lie?
Dr Garth asked me to come this evening.
[ Miss Peabody ]
Well, he-- Go right in, miss.
[ Weakly ]
Thank you.
- Countess Zaleska!
- I had to come.
You-- you said you'd help me.
You're trembling.
Your hands are like ice.
Come. Sit down.
Dr Garth, I--
I can't go on, that is, without you.
You're the one person who stands between me and utter destruction.
I'm leaving London tonight, forever.
- What?
- I-I know the truth now.
There's nothing ahead for me but-- but horror!
You must control yourself if you expect me to understand what you're talking about.
When you left me last night...
I determined to put myself to a test, as you suggested.
I failed!
It came over me again, that overpowering command-- wordless, insistent-- and I had to obey!
- What was it?
- I--
I can't tell you.
It's too-- too ghastly!
I have something here that... may help to steady your nerves.
A mechanical means of inducing hypnosis.
Come here, please.
This little light... shines against the disk... reflected by the mirrors.
- No!
- Why not?
It's too late for experiments.
I'm afraid you're right.
I came to ask you to go with me.
- Go with you?
- Yes, tonight-- to the continent.
Oh, I know it all sounds mad. It is!
But you must do this for me. I'll make any concession, but you must come with me.
- You know that's impossible.
- No, no. Don't say that.
You're a great doctor-- a doctor of minds, of souls.
I need you, Dr Garth.
I need you to save my soul.
How can you expect me even to listen to you... when you're concealing the truth about yourself?
But I have told you all I can now.
You mean, you've told me all you dare.
- [ Telephone Ringing ]
- Pardon me.
- [ Ringing ]
- Yes?
The girl is ready now, Dr Garth.
All right. I'll be there at once.
Pardon me.
I want you to wait here for me.
I'll be back very shortly.
A patient--
I want you to sit down very calmly... and make up your mind exactly how you're going to tell me the truth--
- the entire truth.
- But--
When I come back, we'll decide what can be done... if anything.
Meanwhile...
I wouldn't plan on leaving London tonight, if I were you.
- [ Door Closing ]
- I'll leave... and you'll go with me.
- Where's Dr Garth?
- He'll be back presently.
Won't you sit down?
I'd like to talk to you.
[ Scoffs ] Well, I'm sure we've nothing to discuss, Countess Zaleska.
We might talk of Dr Garth.
He's interested in... both of us.
I'm quite aware of his interest in you, Countess... as a psychiatrist.
Sandor.
[ Gasps ]
- Take her to the car. This way.
- [Janet Screams ]
Lights.
- Don't be afraid.
Nobody's going to hurt you.
- No. No, please!
Let me alone!
Oh, that light-- hurts my eyes.
- Now, now, now, dear. Now.
- Wait.
Just relax. That's better.
Just as though you were going to sleep.
Sound asleep.
That's more like it.
You are sleepy.
It's hard to keep your eyes open... with that light in them, isn't it?
But look at it again... as long as you can.
That's better.
You're almost asleep now.
I want you to try to remember--
Remember.
There are little pictures in your mind-- pictures behind your eyes.
You can see them if you try.
Try. Try!
- You must remember.
- No.
No! No!
Shh. Nothing to be afraid of.
Nothing to fear.
We're here to protect you.
Take it away from my eyes.
- It hurts.
- The light?
The ring.
The ring on your hand.
- Whose hand?
- Your hand, ma'am.
Your eyes.
I don't want to pose.
"Pose"?
Think I'll go, if you don't mind.
Please.
Please let me out, I--
Where are you?
You know.
You remember now.
Your studio.
What studio? Where?
In Chelsea.
I know that.
I used to live here.
Whereabouts in Chelsea?
- You must remember.
- The bookshop's closed.
I don't want to go up those dark stairs.
Let go of my arm.
You're hurting me!
Please!
She's dead.
I think I know where to find the one who's responsible.
Countess Zaleska!
[ Thunderclap ]
- Closing for the night.
- Scotland Yard.
That's different.
What can I do for you?
I'm looking for the studio of a woman who calls herself Countess Zaleska.
Dark, aristocratic.
There's a woman with a place on the third floor.
That ain't her name, but there's some strange goings-on up there.
- Let me use your telephone.
- On the desk. There.
- Beg pardon, sir.
- Yes, Hobbes, yes, what is it?
Can't you see I'm busy?
Dr Garth on the wire, sir.
He says--
Oh, don't stand there telling me what he says. Give me the telephone!
- Yes.
- And Hobbs? Just have a look in that lot there, will you?
See if you can find my Bolivian Blue?
Hello, Hello,Jeffrey.
Yes, yes, what is it? What is it?
- What do you want?
- Take down this address, and bring Von Helsing with you.
Chelsea? Well, what on earth are you doing in Chelsea at this time of night?
- Running down a vampire.
- Vampires. Oh, my--
- Are you drunk?
- Not likely. Will you hurry, please?
All right. All right.
I'll get there as soon as possible... but it's all a pack of nons--
- The Bolivian Blue, sir!
- Idiot, that's a Guatemalan Red.
- Clear away this stuff, will you?
- Yes, sir.
Will you take your barley water now, sir?
Barley water, barley water.
Get me my heavy topcoat and revolver.
- I'm going out after vampires!
- Vampires?
Vampires!
Ha, ha, ha!
Well, I always understood you went after them with checkbooks, sir.
Hobbs, don't be facetious.
N-N-No, sir.
It took you longer than I expected.
- What's all this mean?
- As I told you, I'm leaving tonight... and you're going with me.
No.
- You're coming with me... to Scotland Yard.
- I think not.
I've just come from the bedside of the girl you brought here last night.
Well, she's dead.
What a pity.
She seemed so healthy.
Another victim, last week-- a man.
You're no longer the sympathetic
Samaritan, are you, Dr Garth?
Now you're a policeman.
Nevertheless, you can still help me.
- And you shall.
- Then you must be insane.
Desperate, rather.
There isn't anything I won't do now... to enlist your aid in freeing me of the curse of the Draculas.
- "Draculas"?
- Yes.
I am Dracula's daughter.
Miss Blake.
- What about Miss Blake?
- Do you know where she is?
Yes, Sir Aubrey Bedford's.
- Are you quite sure?
- Positive.
She returned to your study after you left.
We talked, but not too long.
I don't believe you.
Why don't you telephone and find out?
- There's one in that desk.
- Very well.
Hello,Jeffrey, old fellow. Where have you been? When are you coming over?
Pretty soon.
- Is Janet there?
- No, she phoned, about half an hour ago--
What?
- She did what?
- I said, she phoned about half an hour ago.
Said she was meeting you somewhere in Chelsea, of all places.
Some studio or other. I say, what's it all about? Have you found a better party?
Countess Zaleska!
[ Sir Basil ]
Well, this must be the place.
Look here,Jeffrey.
Just what new piece of asininity is this?
She's gone.
She's taken Janet with her.
- Gone? Who's gone?
- Countess Zaleska.
- Dracula's daughter.
- "Dracula's daughter"?
Now, look here, you two.
If you're still playing games with me... if you routed me out of my bed in the middle of the night... to dash down here on some confounded hoax, I--
This is no hoax, Sir Basil.
- Exactly what happened?
- She came to the hospital tonight.
Said she was leaving London.
She begged me to go with her.
- Go with her?
- Well, I refused of course.
Later, after I had examined the girl and traced Zaleska here... she still insisted-- she said she'd force me.
How she got hold of Janet I don't know, but we've got to find them!
Janet's in danger!
Think of what happened to those others.
No, wait. As long as this woman wants to control you...
- she won't harm her.
- What are you standing there for? Do something!
They're still in London.
Send out a general alarm.
Throw a dragnet around the city.
- Where's the telephone?
- In there.
- Zaleska has a flat in Russell Square.
- Oh, she won't be there.
If she manages to slip out of England tonight... there's only one place in this world to which she'll go-- her castle in Transylvania.
[ Sir Basil ]
Hello, hello, hello! Scotland Yard?
Sir Basil Humphrey speaking.
Yes! Get me Squires.
I want a general broadcast.
[ Morse Code Beeping ]
Scotland Yard requests reports about the following--
Uh, I knew I should have turned off my telephone last night.
Yes, well?
What about it?
- What did you find? Oh.
- Nothing, sir.
Nobody at the Russell Square flat, everything torn up--
- no letters, no nothing.
- Huh.
- Dr Garth was there.
- Where is he now?
I don't know, sir.
He went away somewhere in his car.
- [ Ringing ]
- Hello. Yes.
Hello? Uh-- What?
Well, why wasn't it followed?
Somebody'll lose his skin for this, all right.
Dover reports an unidentified plane, no lights, taking off across the Channel an hour ago.
Of course, she'd have made all preparations.
- [ Clicking Phone Switch ]
- Get me the Paris police headquarters.
Well, what are you standing there for?
We must find Jeffrey, and break the news as gently as possible.
-Just came, sir.
- Thank you.
More good news.
Listen to this.
"Chartered plane leaving for Transylvania.
Will keep in touch.Jeffrey Garth."
Stop him!
He's going to his death.
Get me Croydon Airport!
At once, you hear? At once!
[ Folk Tune ]
[ Laughter, Chattering ]
Well, Zoltan, Magdalena-- a fine wedding!
Uh, soon, it will be night.
- [ Howling ]
- A wolf!
[ Howling Continues ]
[ Slows, Stops ]
[ Howling Continues ]
[ Coffin Lid Thumps ]
- [ Townspeople Chattering ]
- The castle!
- The light!
- Dracula!
He's come back!
[ Panicked Chattering ]
The light in the castle--
Dracula!
- What is this?
- The inn, mein Herr. As far as we dare go until morning.
- What?
- The vampire. She walks tonight with her unhallowed father!
- Are you quite sure? Let's get along.
- Ja, ja!
You're just in time. In a few minutes, the doors will be barred until daylight.
I tell you what I'll do.
I'll give you... five pounds... if you take me as far as Borgo Pass, no farther.
- But not further than Borgo Pass!
- That's more like it.
There. And I'll ride in the front seat with you.
- Will you take care of my bag until I come back?
- Yes, sir.
Come along.
He must be mad.
- Beautiful... and helpless.
- Yes.
Why have you left her unharmed?
It's the only way
I can be sure of Garth.
What do you want of Garth?
Release? Still, release?
No, I know that's impossible now.
- I want him.
- What do you mean?
His life, in exchange for hers.
- His death.
- No. No, not death.
Life-- eternal life-- with me.
Have you forgotten your promise that I was to have eternal life?
There is death for Garth if he comes here-- death, not life... and destruction for you.
Get out.
- You won't wait long.
- No, not long.
Up there.
Goodnight, my friend.
Who's there?
[ Gunshot ]
- Where's Janet?
- Safe... so far.
- If you've harmed her--
- You're not in London now,
Dr Garth, with your police.
You're in Transylvania, in my castle.
Never mind all that.
Where is she?
- In there?
- Wait.
Get out of my way.
Very well.
[ Chattering ]
- [ Rattling Doorknob ]
- [ Sir Basil ] Rap on the door.
[ Both Speaking German ]
- What's he saying? What's he saying?
- He's gone to the castle.
- There isn't a moment to be lost.
- Well, let's get on with it.
- Hypnosis, eh?
- Something older... and more powerful.
Whatever it is,
I'll bring her out of it.
Like the other one... who died?
Her pulse is weak,
Dr Garth, growing weaker.
All your skill cannot help her now.
She's under a spell that can be broken only by me... or death.
Well, then, break it!
The great Dr Garth-- helpless...
- as she lies there dying before him?
- She's not dying.
I won't let her die.
Janet--
Your life for hers.
- What are you talking about?
- Remain here.
- Remain--
- Yes, with me among the undead-- one yourself, as only
I can make that possible-- never to know death, as men know it.
- You're insane!
- "Insane"?
To offer you eternal life?
I don't believe in your spells and your magic!
Then let your science save her, or--
- Or what?
- Or agree to remain here.
All right. Release her.
[ Gasps ]
[ Tyres Screeching ]
[ Gunshots ]
- Can it-- Is she?
- She's all right...
- And Countess Zaleska?
- Out there.
Janet, open your eyes.
Oh,Jeffrey!
There's your vampire, Sir Basil.
The arrow-- a wooden shaft through her heart... just as I drove the stake through his.
[ Sir Basil ]
The woman is beautiful.
[ Von Helsing ]
She was beautiful when she died-- a hundred years ago.
Looks like a burial.
In the road?
Driver, what is it?
It’s a funeral, Mademoiselle.
They are afraid of the men who steal dead bodies.
So they dig the grave in the middle of the road where people pass all the time.
Well, that’s a cheerful introduction for you to our West Indies.
Do you know where is the house of monsieur Beaumont?
Zombies! Aller vite! Allez!
It felt like hands touching me!
Why did you drive like that, you fool?
We might have been killed!
Worse than that, Monsieur.
We might have been caught.
Caught? By whom? Those men you spoke to?
They are not men Monsieur, they are dead bodies.
Dead?
Yes, Monsieur. Zombies.
The living dead.
Corpses taken from their graves who are made to work in sugar mills and fields at nights.
Look! Here they come!
Look! Look!
Excuse me please, have you got a match?
Did I frighten you? Ha, I’m sorry.
I’m oddly enough I suppose.
No, it wasn’t you.
Something happened back on the road there.
We stopped to speak to some men.
Our driver told us that they weren’t men at all. He said they were corpses.
Corpses?
Surely you don’t believe it, do you?
No. But I don’t know, Haiti is full of nonsense and superstition.
They’re always mixed up with a lot of mysteries that will turn your hair grey.
I’ve been a missionary here for, oh, thirty years, and at times I don’t know what to think.
Come, let’s go in the house.
Oh, yes, come, dear.
Is Mr. Beaumont in?
You are expected, Dr. Bruner.
Yes... I’ve been sent for to marry someone.
Maybe you...
How long is it that you’ve known Mr. Beaumont?
Oh, only a few days.
Madeline introduced him on the docks in Port-au-Prince.
Ah, and you?
I met him on the ship coming from New York.
He was very kind during the voyage.
Madeline and I planned to be married the moment she arrived, but Mr. Beaumont persuaded us to come here.
And he promised to take me out of the bank at Port-au-Prince and send me to New York as his agent.
Strange.
Very strange.
You...
I’ll tell Mr. Beaumont you are here.
It’s all right, isn’t it, doctor?
Oh, I guess so.
You see I, I’ve only met
Mr. Beaumont once or twice.
But he never struck me like the man who would take the trouble to play fairy godfather to a young couple like you...
Unless...
Unless what, sir?
I suppose you’ll think
I’m a meddling old fool, but...
You know, I’d feel a good deal better if you’d clear out of this place after you’re married, and have nothing more to do with Mr. Beaumont.
The young people have arrived sir, and Dr. Bruner.
They are waiting in the reception hall.
Show them to their rooms, and tell them I’m out.
No wait.
Perhaps I’d better see them.
It might look odd if I didn’t.
Very odd, sir.
Especially as Dr. Bruner is a trifle skeptical as to your... motives, sir.
Nevermind my motives.
Has that other person sent word yet?
No, sir. Not yet.
He’s twenty-four hours late.
I wish you’d keep away from that man, sir.
He'll make trouble for you.
You needn't worry about that.
I'm not affraid of him.
I'm not easily frightened, sir.
You should know that.
But what you are planning is dangerous.
Don’t you suppose I know that, Silver?
You don’t seem to realize what this girl means to me.
Why, I’d sacrifice anything
I have in the world for her.
Nothing matters if I can’t have her.
I think, ah, I think you’ll like Haiti.
Most people that...
Madeline! I’m delighted to see you!
Neil, you’re more than welcome.
Thank you, sir.
Doctor, it is very kind of you to come.
I know what a busy man you are.
No, ah, not at all. There is a native family live out here that I’ve been trying to see for a long time.
After this young couple are safely married, I'll leave.
But surely you will stay for dinner after the ceremony?
No, no, no. No, I must run along.
That’s a great pity. We have something very special prepared for this occasion.
It was very good of you, Madeline, to humour the whim of a lonely man.
There was so little time to prepare,
I couldn’t do half the things
I wanted for you.
You’ve done more than enough already
Mr. Beaumont, for a comparative... giving Neil a position in The States.
Neil?
Yes. Yes indeed.
Oh, yes of course! I’m sure Neil will make a very good agent.
But you must be tired after your drive.
You get some rest.
Silver!
Silver will show you to your rooms.
This way please.
Delighted to see you again, monsieur Beaumont!
Please.
Please.
I’m sorry to have kept you waiting, monsieur.
I’ve been on a journey seeking men for my mills.
Men?
They work faithfully...
They are not worried about long hours.
You... can make good use of men like mine on your plantations.
No.
That’s not what I want.
Then perhaps we should talk about the young lady who came to your house this evening?
You’ve seen her? When?
The road, tonight.
There was a young man with her.
They are to be married, tonight.
You waited too long to do anything.
What do you want me to do?
If she were to disappear, for a month...
What do you hope to gain by her disappearance?
Everything...
Everything?
Do you think she will forget her lover in a month?
Just give me a month.
One little month.
Not in a month. Not even a year, monsieur.
I looked into her eyes. She is deep in love. But not with you.
They are to be married within an hour!
There must be a way!
There is way.
The cost...
The cost is heavy!
You give me what I want, and you may ask anything.
No! Not that!
Only a pin point, monsieur Beaumont, in a glass of wine or perhaps a flower.
Take it.
The time is very brief.
You must do your share if
I am to help you.
Keep it, monsieur.
Keep it.
You may change your mind.
Send me word when you use it.
- I’ll find another way.
- There is no other way.
They are driving away evil spirits!
Close it, close it!
Mademoiselle!
I love you, Madeline, more than anything else in this whole world, dear.
Heaven or hell lies in this little moment for me.
You could raise me up to paradise or you could blast my world into nothingness.
I can make you the envy of every woman.
I’d give my life to make you happy!
Oh, listen to me dear before it’s too late!
Don’t, please.
Don’t go into that room.
We can be in Port-au-Prince in half an hour.
There’s a boat sailing at midnight.
You’ve been so wonderful.
Don’t spoil everything now.
One last gift before I lose you forever!
We are gathered together here in the sight of God, and in the face of this company, to join together this man, this woman in holy matrimony.
This is the night of nights!
A toast to the bride!
To beauty’s queen!
Gladly, My Lord!
Leave but a kiss within the glass.
Fair gypsy, read my fortune.
What do you see in the glass?
I see happiness...
I see love, far more than you can bear.
Is that all?
No.
I see...
I see...
What is it?
I see death.
Madelin!
Madeline, what’s wrong?
Madeline my dear, please.
Oh, no...
Madeline?
Madeline?
Can’t we do something?
Please, please.
Madeline!
Not my wife. My wife!
Praise of our lord and saviour and the love of god and the fellowship of his angels.
Be with us ever more. Amen.
Neil, Neil...
Neil...
Neil...
Neil...
Neil...
Look!
Zombies!
Yes.
They are my servants.
Did you think we could do it alone?
In their lifetime they were my enemies.
Ledot, the witch doctor.
Once my master.
Secrets I tortured out of him.
Von Gelder, the swine.
Swollen with riches.
He fought against my spells until the last.
In him I have a struggling type.
His Excellence, Richard.
Once minister of the interior.
Scarpia, Brigand Chief.
Marcquis, Captain of Gendarmerie....
And this, this is Chauvin, the high executioner, who almost executed me!
I took them just as we will take this one.
But what if they regain their souls?
They would tear me to pieces.
But that, my friend, shall never be.
Madeline!
Madeline!
Madeline!
Madeline!
There’s two explanations that strike me, either the body was stolen by the members of a death cult that use human bones in their ceremonies, or else...
Or else what?
She’s not dead.
Not dead?
Are you mad?
I saw her die, the doctor signed the certificate.
I saw them bury her.
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute,
I’m not mad.
But I’ve lived in these islands for a good many years, and I’ve seen things with my eyes that made me think I was crazy.
There are superstitions in Haiti that the natives brought here from Africa.
Some of them can be traced back as far as ancient Egypt, and beyond that yet, in the countries that was old when Egypt was young.
Yes, but what has that to do with Madeline?
I kissed her as she lay there in the coffin.
And her lips were cold.
Let me explain.
Now, just a minute, I’ll explain.
Wherever there is a superstition, you will find there is also a practice.
Now, do you remember what your driver told you the night that he took you to Beaumont’s house?
Oh, about those horrible creatures we saw?
He said they were corpses!
Taken from their graves.
Yes - that’s the superstition!
Now for the practice.
The ghouls that steal the dead corpses from their graves, are supposed to put them there in the first place.
Do you mean that
Madeline was murdered so that somebody could steal her dead body?
Aagh! Nonsense!
No, no. Not her...
Her body, yes. But not her dead body.
That’s what I meant.
Well, surely you don’t think she’s alive, in the hands of natives?
Oh no, better dead than that!
Excuse me please, have you got a match?
Thank you.
You don’t believe that, do you?
Say, there’s been lots of people that’s been pronounced dead that came alive again and lived for years.
Now, if nature can play pranks like that, why isn’t it possible to play pranks with nature?
Oh, I don’t know.
Your driver believed he saw dead men, walking.
He didn’t. What he saw was men alive and everything but this and this.
Oh, the whole thing has me confused!
I just can’t understand it.
Um, I don’t blame you...
I don’t blame you.
I’ve been trying for years to get to the bottom of these things.
To separate what you call fact from fiction.
The law!
The law of Haiti acknowledges the possibility of being buried alive.
Here it is in the penal code.
I’ll read it for you.
It’s in French, do you speak French?
No.
Excuse me please, have you got a match?
Right here, here’s one.
Oh, thank you. I didn’t see it there.
I’ll translate it for you.
If you could spare me.
Article...
Article 2.49.
The use...
The use of drugs or other practices which produce lethargic coma, or lifeless sleep, shall be considered attempted murder.
Attempted!
Yes I see.
If the person has been buried alive, the act should be considered murder no matter what result follows.
Beaumont!
Say, you said you couldn’t understand why he was so interested in us.
Do you think he did this?
No. No, I think his natives would.
Natives would be right.
Of course if you want to, we could go to Beaumont’s house first.
If I could get my hands on the devil that’s responsible for this,
I’ll make him such an example that every witch doctor in Haiti would be shaking in his sandals.
But we can’t do this alone.
Can’t the authorities help?
The authorities, Neil, my boy, you don’t know these islands.
The native authorities are afraid to meddle.
I am not. I’ve got friends among the natives.
They’ll tell me things that no gendarme could ever get out of them.
Because I am a preacher.
They think I am a magician.
Before we get through with this thing, we may uncover sins that even the devil would be ashamed of.
Oh, these witch doctors...
Madeline...
Foolish things, they can’t bring back the light to those eyes.
I was mad to do this, but if you had smiled on me,
I’d have done anything for you, given you anything.
I thought that beauty alone would satisfy, but the soul is gone...
I can’t bear those empty staring eyes.
Oh, forgive me, Madeline.
Forgive me!
I can’t bear it any longer,
I must take you back.
Back to the grave,
Monsieur?
No, you must put the life back into her eyes and bring laughter to her lips.
She must be gay and happy again!
You paint a charming picture,
Monsieur.
One that I should like to see myself!
You must bring her back.
Aren’t you a trifle afraid,
Monsieur?
How do suppose those eyes will regard you when the brain is able to understand?
Better to see hatred in them than that dreadful emptiness.
Perhaps you’re right.
It would be a pity to destroy such a lovely flower.
Let’s drink to the future of this flower.
A glass of wine!
Silver, bring wine!
We have a toast to drink.
To the future,
Monsieur!
Only a pin point,
Monsieur.
In a flower... or perhaps in a glass of wine?
You devil!
What are you trying to do to me?
I have other plans for Mademoiselle.
And I am afraid you might not agree.
I have taken a fancy to you,
Monsieur!
Silver! Silver!
Don’t, don’t!
To the future,
Monsieur!
The vulture, you...
No. Not that.
Not that!
We ought to be picking up an old witch doctor around here pretty soon.
His name is Pierre, I’ve known him for years. Bright old fellow.
I don’t know just where we’ll find him.
Come, son.
There are evil spirits in the road.
I will give you an awonga.
And here, this one for the ox.
Young man is sick with distress.
Well hey, wait a minute, we can’t afford to have you sick.
Neil, why don’t you go over there, we've got a hard day before us tomorrow.
Now, now then Pierre, come on.
He’s gone. We can talk.
It is a dangerous thing you ask me to do.
Well now listen here you know, we're old friends, you and me, and I want to go on.
Turn back before it is too late!
Oh, no. I’ve come too far to turn back now.
I’m too old to go all this way with you.
Well listen, can’t you get somebody to go with us?
My people all afraid of the mountain.
Why?
Because it is called the land of the living dead.
Well, have, have you ever been there?
I am the only man that has ever come back from there alive.
There is an evil spirit man that is called Murder.
Come, I will tell you all about what he did.
Vulture.
Just as old Pierre said.
A cloud of vultures always hovers over the house of the living dead.
Madeline...
Is she there?
Oh, I must go and see her.
Neil, my boy, please, please lie down and rest. Please.
You’ll feel stronger in the morning.
You rest.
Let me go up and see what I can do.
Why is she so restless tonight?
Perhaps she remembers something?
They never remember anything when they are like that.
No?
Because she’s cut off.
Madeline!
Madeline!
No, no, I can’t,
I can’t!
You must, it’s your turn.
Let’s run away!
He might hear you!
No way. I can’t stand it.
I am going to run away!
He will find you and make you like her.
Can you still hear me?
It is unfortunate you are no longer able to speak.
I should be interested to hear you describe your symptoms...
You see, you are the first man to know what is happening.
None of the others did.
You refused to shake hands once.
I remember.
Well, well.
We understand each other better now.
Madeline!
Madeline!
Madeline!
Madeline!
I found you!
You’re alive.
Alive!
What’s the matter?
It’s I, Neil.
Oh my darling, what have they done to you?
Who are you?
And what are they?
For you, my friend, they are the angels of death.
Come! Zombies!
Duck!
Look!
Madeline, don’t you know me, dear?
It’s Neil.
I could swear, for a moment she recognized you.
Come on, don’t let him get away!
Madeline, my darling!
Neil, I...
I dreamed?
Excuse me please, have you got a match?

- Well, Doctor?
- An heir, my lord, and a brother for him.
Twins.
Twins?
- A toast. Let's drink to it.
- No.
Don't toast this birth. Please.
Do you all know how our family began?
With twins.
Brand and Wolfram.
And it will end with twins.
Brand, the younger, murdered his brother.
This house began with murder.
It will end the same way.
"I end as I began. "
My eyes. Lieutenant Hassel, would you please?
Certainly, sir.
"And after that night,
Wolfram was never seen again,
"either within the castle or without.
"And all men knew that he had been slain
"by his younger brother in the Black Room. "
Even if it were true, there's no younger and no older.
- They're twins.
- You're wrong, Lieutenant Hassel.
One is always older than the other.
Your boys were born a minute apart, my lord.
The prophecy must fall on my children.
The older will inherit the title and the lands. The younger bitter...
The younger will have greater reason than that for bitterness, my lord.
- His right arm is paralyzed.
- Paralyzed?
I'm sorry.
But, your lordship, you're not really going to worry about this barbaric prophecy.
A thing that has been believed in for hundreds of years?
Read. Read further.
"And the wise have thought that once again there shall be twins
"and the younger shall slay the older.
"That is the meaning of the motto of the house of de Berghman. "
- But you can't believe in this, sir.
- I do believe it.
This murder will happen again. In the Black Room just as it did before.
No, no, don't open it.
My friends, this tragedy may not happen for 20, 30, 50 years.
I will be dead then. We all may be.
What can I do now to prevent this prophecy from ever being fulfilled?
Your lordship's living in the past. We don't believe...
I do.
Something must be done.
May I offer a simple suggestion?
You believe that the younger brother will kill the older in the Black Room?
Yes, I do.
Then the prevention is simple, seal it up.
And there won't be any Black Room.
If you'll permit me to say so, your lordship, your parents' graves are in a disgraceful condition.
I know. I know. But now that my brother's returning,
- we can take care of it together.
- Good.
The Budapest post arrives at the inn in an hour.
You're sure you don't want to meet him there?
There've been so many attempts on my life of late,
I don't want to be seen in public places. Hurry him to me at the castle.
I only thought as you haven't seen your brother, Anton, in 10 years...
That's why I want to meet him alone.
Don't be afraid, say it.
The Baron is a tyrant.
He's worse than that. He's a fiend.
There is only one way to protect ourselves from him.
That won't be so easy. He keeps to himself.
You're afraid, that's the trouble. You're cowards.
We begged the authorities for help. A lot of good it did us.
What does he have to do to us till we strike back?
It's easy to talk, but who's going to do it?
Just give me a chance. Put him in reach.
The coach from Budapest.
Has the Baron's coach arrived?
Oh. Some sherry, please.
He looks like the Baron.
Say, he does.
Didn't the Baron have a brother who left here long ago?
Yes. What's he come back for?
One de Berghman is enough.
There's the Baron's coach now.
- Anton.
- Why, Colonel Hassel.
- I'm glad to see you.
- And my brother? Gregor?
Gregor is at the castle.
I am to bring you to him.
Come, Thor.
You'll find things changed.
If Gregor's letter hadn't been so insistent, I should never have returned.
I couldn't believe that he'd write to me like that.
It wasn't an invitation.
It was a plea, an entreaty.
You should never have left.
It was unbearable here before. I had to leave.
- Because of a superstitious legend?
- No.
Because of what hearing so much about it did to me.
I began to believe in the prophecy, in spite of myself.
Every time I looked at
Gregor, my own brother, he seemed to expect me to kill him.
That was meant for your brother, Gregor.
- Welcome home, sir.
- Oh, Peter, how are you?
Very good, sir. Thank you.
Thanks for bringing me, Colonel.
My niece and I are expecting you and your brother to dinner tonight.
- You remember Thea?
- Why, of course, I remember Thea.
- A lovely little girl.
- Only now she's a lovely big girl.
- We'll be there.
- Thank you.
We are all happy you are back, sir.
The castle will be more cheerful, sir.
It is a gloomy place. 10 years almost made me forget it.
- Now it all comes back.
- One does feel the gloom, sir.
"Principio et finem similia. "
Anton.
This is good.
Let me look at you.
You're looking good.
- Enjoy your years in Budapest?
- Oh, very much. It's gay there.
But how are you, Gregor?
If my subjects hadn't been so unruly,
I'd have proclaimed a great festival in your honor.
They don't deserve a feast, much as you do.
Sit down, Anton.
I've ordered some wine for you.
Thanks for coming back to our home.
It's been lonely for me here. But now we can divide the responsibilities.
Come in.
I brought wine from the south vineyards.
- I remembered Mr. Anton was fond of it.
- Thank you, Peter.
Drink it.
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yes, your lordship.
Why do you do this, Gregor?
All right. That's all.
Surely you don't think he poisoned it?
Think? I know. Those swine will do anything.
They don't know what they want. I can't trust my servants or anyone.
My life's not my own anymore.
Gregor, on my way here today, I was shot at.
They mistook you for me.
- But what is it they have against you?
- Lies. It's not worth talking about.
But you must deny them, Gregor, or I will.
Fine, Anton. That's why I sent for you.
The Black Room and its prophecy have stood between us long enough.
A solid wall of brick stands between it and us.
We can forget it. What do you say, brother?
With all my heart.
Then we've nothing to torment us except the Colonel who's expecting us to dinner.
Shall we go?
Max, Ludwig, Emil!
They'll kill you, Anton. Out of the way. I'll take care of those swine.
Let the dog alone. Let the dog alone!
Don't stop him. Don't stop him.
- Kill him, Thor.
- You want him torn to pieces?
Thor. Thor.
Now, what's the meaning of this?
Ask him what became of my sister.
- Your sister?
- Yes, and the other women.
Ask him becomes of all the women.
Why are they never seen again?
Take him away. I'll deal with him later.
No, wait. I've got to get to the bottom of this.
Stop. I give orders around here, not you.
Take him away.
Why do you look at me like that?
This is how it was before I went away.
It's nothing, my dear Anton. Come, we mustn't be late for dinner.
I'm so anxious to have you see Thea. She's extraordinary.
Come.
Love is like music
Beautiful music to my heart
Sweet music from nowhere
You'll never know where love may start
It may come to you while you're dreaming
While the silvery moonbeams are gleaming
Love is like music
Beautiful music to my heart
- Lovely. Lovely.
- Yes.
She's a lovely child.
I think your lordship's brother was referring to the music.
I think I meant both.
Thank you.
If you will excuse me, sir, I must leave.
- Good night, sir.
- It's a great pleasure to know you.
Thank you. Colonel Hassel.
- Good night, Thea.
- I'll see you to the door.
Tonight?
You know you don't have to leave so soon. What's the matter?
Thea, darling, it's enough watching him paw you but suddenly when he looked at you...
I don't mean to frighten you,
Thea, but that Gregor is a monster.
- Don't you feel it?
- Every time he comes near me.
My blood turns to ice when he touches me.
It's all I can do to keep my heart from stopping.
I'd give anything if you didn't have to suffer all this, but there's no way out of it for us yet.
I swear to you, we'd be happier away from here.
- Do you believe me?
- I do.
I tell it to myself a hundred times a day. Oh, don't worry about me, Albert.
And now, dear,
I think I ought to go back.
Don't be frightened, Thea. But
I must ask you to do one thing.
Never allow yourself to be alone with him for a minute here in his castle.
Always have somebody with you. Will you promise me that?
Of course, dear. Good night.
- Good night, Thea. I love you.
- I know you do.
You know, my dear, if I ever decide to marry,
I can think of no one who would make a more charming Baroness than you.
- Thank you.
- Don't you agree with me, gentlemen?
Mashka.
Mashka.
- Beran, what are you doing here?
- Watching you.
You attend to your own business.
I don't need any watching.
- I won't have you going to the castle again.
- So, you followed me?
- You used to want to be with me all the time.
- Well, I don't now.
- You're not going.
- It doesn't concern you.
Let go of me, you fool.
Sweet music from nowhere
You'll never know where love may start
It may come to you while you're dreaming
While the silvery moonbeams are gleaming
Love is like music
Beautiful music to my heart
Don't I play as well as she does?
Didn't you listen?
- Don't you want to kiss me?
- A pear is the best fruit.
Every time you see her, you want to be rid of me.
Lots of juice in a pear.
Well, you'll find I'll not be got rid of so easy.
- Do you hear what I say?
- Adam should've chosen a pear.
You got it all planned, haven't you? You're gonna marry her.
You're gonna make her your wife, your Baroness.
I like the feel of a pear. And when you're through with it...
Well, you're not going to marry her. I'll put a stop to it.
You will? How?
You needn't feel so safe.
I'll tell her you asked me up here to play for you.
Her future husband, the Baron, talking with a servant, listening to her sing.
- I'll lie. I'll tell her worse than that.
- Oh, don't be foolish, child.
If you were in my place, who would you choose?
Colonel Hassel's niece or you?
All right, who would you choose?
A sweet little innocent who plays the harp or someone who knows the other door to the Black Room?
Someone who's seen you carry heavy things in there late at night.
- You've been spying me.
- Oh, I didn't mean to.
I didn't mean to really.
- Who is it?
- It's me, your lordship, Peter.
- Is there anything you want?
- No. Nothing. Nothing.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night. Good night.
Is there anything I can do for you, sir?
No, thank you, Peter. No.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Peter. Good night.
- Oh, it's you, your lordship.
- Yes.
Good night, Peter.
Are you sure there is nothing I can do for you, sir?
Quite sure. Good night.
Yes, sir. Good night, sir.
Quiet. Quiet, Thor.
And that is the last that was heard of her.
She served dinner at the Colonel's house.
- The Baron was there.
- And who else was there?
Yes. He's never far away when something like this happens.
She came out and I tried to stop her, but she wouldn't listen.
She broke away and she went into the castle.
- I don't want to get into any trouble.
- You won't get in any trouble.
- I'm afraid the Baron will kill me.
- Come on.
- What have you found out?
- This.
That's hers.
That's the shawl Mashka was wearing the night she went to the castle.
Where did you find it?
- Come on. Where did you find it?
- At the head of the stairs.
- Outside his lordship's room.
- I thought so.
Now do you believe the Baron killed Mashka?
I do for one. But what are we going to do about it?
Appeal to the authorities again?
- We can't let him go on like this.
- No more murders.
- I'll do anything.
- We have to stop this one way or another.
- There's only one way.
- Come on, let's go to the castle.
- Yeah.
- We're all here.
Come on, then.
Follow me.
You may be indifferent if you like, your lordship, but the peasants are aroused.
Are you so filled with your own importance you think nothing can happen to you?
Would you mind if the peasants took my life, Colonel?
Have you ever seen a man torn to pieces by a mob, your lordship?
No, and I won't.
When trouble comes, I'll meet it my own way.
Well, I have warned you. That's all I can do.
You're getting old,
Colonel. You worry too much.
Thank you.
If you worried a little more, you might live to be old.
Come, my dear, we are leaving.
Let me see you to your carriage.
Now what can I do to bring you here more often?
- You know we need such loveliness here.
- Thank you.
- Why are they coming here?
- I've been expecting this.
But what do they want?
I've warned your brother. Quick, take Thea inside, she's not safe here.
- Why, I could...
- I'll manage them.
- What is this?
- We want the Baron.
- What do you want with him?
- I'll tell that to him.
You can talk to me. I'll deliver your message.
- You can't storm in here like this.
- We're going in. Get out of the way.
- But look here, my friend, surely we can...
- Come on. Follow me.
Thor. Thor.
Here he is, in here.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
I've been expecting you.
Come in, come in. Don't stand on ceremony.
- We have come...
- For me. I know.
You're the ring leader, aren't you?
Well, what are you looking so sheepish for?
You came here to dictate terms to me, didn't you?
Sit down. Sit down. You'll find it very comfortable.
You've come to get rid of me, haven't you?
- Yes.
- We have.
Wait. I know how you feel, but you must do this in an orderly way.
- Sure, orderly. But we get rid of him.
- As long as he is here, we won't be safe.
But don't you understand?
The government won't tolerate your taking authority into your own hands this way.
- The government doesn't care about us.
- But can't you see? I'm trying to help you.
We want safety for our sisters, our wives, and our sweethearts.
But my brother has done nothing. What proof have you?
If you harm him, you will answer to me.
Don't interfere, we don't want to harm you. We respect you.
But that butchering brother of yours has carried off our women before you ever came here, and it ends right now.
As long as you all feel so kindly towards my brother,
I have a suggestion.
I renounce my title in favor of my brother.
- Are you in earnest?
- I am.
In fact, that's why I brought my brother back.
I knew you were dissatisfied.
I knew you wanted somebody else to govern you.
Well, you have him. My brother, Anton.
It's ridiculous. I won't hear of it.
I think it's an excellent idea.
I was sure you'd approve, Colonel, and you're all very generous to spare my life.
I will not forget.
Can I have a little time to settle my affairs before I leave the country?
I'm sure my good friend, the Colonel, will take over the tedious business of transferring the estate.
- Won't you, Colonel?
- It will be a pleasure.
Come, Thea.
Your worries are over, too. You won't have to be the Baroness after all.
Come, Thea.
No more responsibility.
I shall be what you were.
A student, a wanderer.
A free man.
Here's the steward's account of this year's crops.
Inventory of taxes, Baron Anton.
Sounds well, doesn't it, brother?
No? Well, don't let it upset you.
I'm the one to feel badly about it, not you.
Oh, there is just one more thing that you should know before I leave.
Come here, brother.
You're surprised.
You thought no one had been in there for 40 years.
Well, that was true till I decided to have a look at it.
And it's nothing. Centuries of fear for nothing.
Come in.
Still worried about that stupid legend? Don't be foolish.
According to the legend, you're supposed to kill me.
Careful of your head, Anton.
The Black Room.
It is black.
The walls are onyx.
What's that?
The pit.
Our ancestors used to throw their enemies there and left them till they rotted and died.
That's where Brand killed
Wolfram and the legend began.
Why, there are bodies there.
Yes.
And this knife. There's blood on it.
Yes.
Is that a woman?
Yes. Mashka.
Then the horrible things they say about you are true.
Yes.
Why have you brought me here?
Why not?
No one will know it.
No! No!
Gregor.
Did you really think I meant to turn the title over to you?
I've been getting ready for this for months. I knew they wanted to be rid of me.
Now when I appear before them as the kindly Anton, no one will oppose me.
Not even Thea.
Goodbye, brother.
There's nothing to fear now.
The prophecy can't be fulfilled.
It will be fulfilled.
Perhaps you will come back from the dead to kill me?
Even from the dead.
Will you announce Baron Anton?
Good evening, Colonel Hassel.
My dear Thea.
You play a remarkably bad game of chess, my dear Anton.
Your attack is as weak as your brother Gregor's was brilliant.
Chess, by the way, was the only virtue I ever discovered in him.
I received a letter today from him from Warsaw.
Most of it was devoted to begging me to send his love to you, Colonel.
His love to me?
Well, if I have to accept it,
I'd rather have it by post than any way I can think of.
He also asked to be kindly remembered to Thea.
He loved her, Colonel.
The very thought of my child being loved by such a fiend, I...
I beg your pardon, Anton.
I forgot for the moment I was speaking of your brother.
You are so unlike him. Forgive me.
Don't let it disturb you, Colonel. No one knows Gregor any better than I do.
I believe it's your move.
There's one subject however on which my brother and I agree.
Thea would make a charming Baroness.
- This is a surprise.
- An agreeable one, I hope.
It'd be a happy event uniting our houses.
I can see no obstacle to it.
I trust Thea shares your kindly feelings.
I know what he's doing here. He wants you.
You think everyone wants me just because you do.
- I've seen the way he looks at you.
- Oh, come now.
- I'm sure you're just imagining.
- I'm not.
Your uncle is probably flattered by the idea of your marrying a Baron.
Before when his brother asked for you, there wasn't any danger because the Colonel didn't like him. But this time...
- You're not gonna get into any quarrel.
- I will if I have to.
I've thought of nothing else since my retirement.
- May I have her answer soon?
- I'll give you her answer now.
- Her answer is no.
- Please, Albert.
What?
She's going to marry me.
I assure you, Colonel, I had no idea when I spoke...
Well, now you have.
Young man, are you presuming to tell me what to do?
I'm not presuming, sir.
But if anyone should try to take her from me,
I'd put a foot of steel through his body.
How dare you?
I beg your pardon, Colonel
Hassel. I forgot myself, sir.
You did, indeed.
- You mustn't leave in this storm.
- Well, I'm not wanted here.
May I have my hat?
- No.
- Why not?
Because if I give you your hat, and you go out wearing it in this storm, you won't catch cold, or get pneumonia and I won't be able to bring flowers to the hospital or wear beautiful black clothes to your funeral.
And besides, I think your temper is recovered enough so you can go back and apologize to your superior officer.
- I've said nothing to apologize for.
- I know it.
Do it anyway just because
Uncle's such a sweet old dear.
Don't go, dear.
A soldier must be in the barracks by midnight.
You're like that little man on the music box, always showing himself to his lady and always dancing away again.
Except that I always leave the Baron for you.
Don't, dear.
Let's talk about ourselves while we can.
What's the use, Thea?
Your uncle and he are in the study right now arranging for him to marry you.
They're doing nothing of the kind. You saw them take the table in the study.
They're in there playing the same game of chess they started this afternoon.
So, you see, Anton, I was greatly pleased when you asked for Thea's hand.
According to this, you've made me Thea's guardian.
Yes.
You'll live for a good many years yet, Colonel.
And if not, I shall rest easy.
You've given me complete control of all Thea's property.
I shall have the same authority that you have.
- Exactly.
- There may be complications.
- You know how I regard Thea.
- Why should that interfere?
- The young Lieutenant?
- Puppy love.
Her interests shall be my first duty.
- Then you accept?
- Gladly.
I knew you would.
Sign, Anton. Here.
- But don't you want to think about it a little?
- No, no.
Sign and let me know this dream has come true.
- But surely you want to talk to Thea?
- No, no, come.
Sit here. We'll tell her when it's over.
- There's ink on it.
- Oh...
This is so formal an act,
I feel that we should drink together to... To complete the ceremony.
By all means.
Why not some of Thea's favorite cordial?
- A sweet liqueur?
- What could be more appropriate?
- Would you mind, Colonel?
- Not at all.
I gave this liqueur to Thea's mother when she was married.
On various ceremonious occasions she used to take a few drops of it.
Thea tasted it for the first time when she was confirmed.
How much sweeter it'll be to her now that her wedding agreement will be sealed with it.
- Now sign, Anton.
- It's signed.
While you were getting the cordial.
So it is. Good.
I've never been happier in my life. I'm a very fortunate man.
- To the union of noble houses.
- Thank you.
Thea's mother was a queenly woman.
And speaking of queens,
I think I can place a guard on yours.
Guard.
- Guard your queen.
- Very good.
I'm afraid I'll have to check your king.
Watch this.
Out of my check, your king and queen.
Splendid! Masterful!
You made exactly that same move three weeks ago.
- But we didn't play three...
- I saw you sign that paper.
Gregor!
What have you done with your brother? Where's Anton?
Have you killed him, too?
Don't you jump to conclusions?
You have killed your brother.
Why don't you notify the authorities?
Do you imagine that I won't?
I'm not afraid of you, Gregor.
It's my duty to arrest you.
Thank God I can save Thea from you.
Go in, dear.
All right, Thea.
- Good night, Albert.
- Good night, my darling.
Colonel Hassel?
Colonel Hassel?
Have you seen Colonel Hassel?
- Isn't he in his study, sir?
- I was just in there and the room's empty.
Then he must have gone to bed, sir.
- Thank you, Anna. Good night.
- Good night, sir.
We shall endeavor to prove that this man, Albert Lussan, did, in a fit of insane jealously, murder Colonel Paul Hassel.
First witness, the footman, Michael.
All I know is, I heard Lieutenant
Lussan shouting at the Colonel.
What did he say?
He said he wouldn't let anyone separate them.
Next witness. The butler, Raoul.
He said if the Colonel interfered, he'd put a foot of steel through his body.
Next witness, the housekeeper, Anna.
Lieutenant Lussan came out of Colonel Hassel's study.
- Did he say what he was doing there?
- He said he was looking for Colonel Hassel.
- What did he do then?
- He left the house.
Next witness, the house maid, Marie.
What did you find when you entered the study next morning?
I found the Colonel's body.
He had been stabbed.
Next witness.
Yes. Yes, they did quarrel.
- Did you see him enter the Colonel's study?
- Well, no,
- I didn't exactly see him go in.
- Did he say he was going into the study?
Well, yes. He said he was going in, but...
Next witness, Baron Anton.
I ask to be excused from testifying.
I was so friendly to the young Lieutenant. I don't wish to injure his reputation further.
You're found guilty of the murder of Colonel Hassel.
It is the sentence of this court, that one month from this day, you will be shot till dead in accordance with the laws of the land.
Don't you think you come here too often, Thea?
It's not good for you.
- It's so hard to realize he's gone.
- Yes.
He's gone.
They're all gone.
They?
All who were there when I was born. My parents, my family.
He was the last. I'm left alone.
- But your brother.
- Oh, yes, my brother.
I'm sorry. I beg your pardon.
I've so much on my mind.
Come.
Did you see Lieutenant Lussan?
Yes, I saw him at the prison today.
- Did he speak of me?
- Yes.
He said he didn't want to see you.
There, there, my dear, don't cry.
I loved him.
Of course, you did. We can all be mistaken in people.
You're the only real friend I have now.
Your uncle set all his hopes in us, Thea.
It was his last wish that you should be my wife.
And it's mine, too.
I wish I loved you.
Won't you try?
Give me time, Anton.
Please.
Certainly, dear.
- You must be very happy.
- You make a beautiful bride.
You're lovely, even for a Baroness.
Baroness.
What's wrong, your ladyship?
When I used to dream of being married, it was never as a Baroness.
There, your lordship, I think it is most becoming, if I may be permitted to say so.
Your bride will find you most attractive.
- Excellent.
- Excellent.
- Exquisite.
- Magnificent.
- Wonderful.
- Wonderful.
I'm very well pleased. You may go.
Never use your right arm again.
Never stretch it out.
Never embrace Thea. Never even defend yourself with it.
It's paralyzed till death.
Yes.
You're dead, Anton.
Good and dead.
You're going to be married today.
But you won't be there.
- Emil.
- Yes, your lordship?
Didn't I tell you to get rid of that dog?
I tried to, your lordship, but he always comes back.
Poison him. Drown him. Do anything, but get rid of him.
Yes, your lordship.
I can't understand.
He always was so fond of the dog.
- Come on. Come on! Come back!
- Thor! Thor!
- Thor! Come here!
- Come back here! Come back.
- Thor!
- Thor!
But you can be across the border in a few hours, Lieutenant.
No!
Everyone's at the wedding.
They won't miss you for hours.
- No!
- You'll be out of the country by then.
Why should I run away from something I didn't do?
But if you didn't do it, why don't you save yourself? Get away.
At least then you'll give yourself a chance to prove that you didn't do it.
Thea believes me guilty.
Not even one word from her since I've been here.
- I don't care about the rest.
- You're wrong, Lieutenant.
I know she's asked about you many times.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
But I was told...
- I've changed my mind, Beran. I'm going.
- That's fine, sir.
I'll get out of here, anyway. Then we'll see.
If my lady will follow me, I will show her where she is to wait.
My lady.
I'll show you to the antechamber, my lady.
Thea.
Albert. How did you get here?
My dear!
I had to see you, Thea.
Tell me you believe me.
I do. I do. But, please, dear, they mustn't find you here.
Hold me close, darling.
Oh, my dearest, you can't marry him.
What am I doing? You can't stay here. You must go.
I love you so. Nothing, nothing will ever dim my love for you.
Nor mine. All my life there'll never be anyone else.
Only, I'm so afraid for you.
Please go before they find you.
Your ladyship.
Hurry.
God bless you and... And...
Your ladyship.
Yes.
The Baron is waiting. Everything is ready.
I'm coming.
If anyone knows any reason why these two should not be joined in holy wedlock, let him speak now or forever hold his peace.
Then I now pronounce you man and...
- Gregor.
- Look, he moved his right arm.
There is the man who murdered Colonel Hassel!
It's Gregor!
Look, there must be an opening in there.
Both of them.
The older brother killed by the younger brother's knife.
Then the prophecy has been fulfilled.
Hogan! , Cookie! , Go see who it is!
- , Go see who it is!
- ? Who?? I? , S ي, t! , Come back there!
- Who to come?
- , Come back there!
The big boss came through the forest to talk to you.
Matawomba?
- What was his path?
- Less than one moon.
It's fine, send it to me.
And welcome him.
Cast the rest of those children out of my entrance.
Do you speak to me? ,Come on! Wait a minute.
Thinking better, we will give each one a piece of sugar.
I learned this observing the missionaries.
It takes a lifetime to
Christianize a native... and I can undo everything in two minutes with a sugar cube.
Times are changing.
I never saw the chief come here unless you called him.
- Do you know what I think?
- No, and I do not care.
You are discovering our cheap magic.
Black magic for the Womba. , For the Womba!
I think maybe another new white man would come, huh?
Before you see another white man the quinine and water will run through your veins. , Not even you will be interested!
Cor name... "Queen of May".
With all the men you've met, have you ever seen an Adonis like that?
Smile, little rat in the forest, smile.
- Are you already preparing your things?
- , Yes, hurry!
The old boss has said that
Gregg communicated... that he would give him 50 fangs if he allowed him to trade within Yuyu's circle.
Tula... make great talk.
Matawomba...
Matawomba... great yuyu.
I hate seeing good gin wasted on that parched monkey.
That's not gin, I gave it to her.
It's kerosene.
He saved us by the hair, Chief.
- When I want your compliments I will ask for them.
- You duped them.
Catch t too.
I told him that Gregg was at the bottom of this. , 50 ivory tusks! , For 1,000 ivory tusks...
I could not go into the circle anymore than you can get out!
I'm getting very nostalgic!
As nostalgic as Scotland
Yard is for you.
Why do not you hand out the ivory as you said you would... and we get out of here?
You can always promise to take me to
Zanzibar and buy me bracelets and bracelets.
Oh, stop whining!
Save those things.
Close the doors.
A month closer, Gregg.
You're almost at the end of your rope.
With his foot in my column, he scoffed.
You are not as popular with the king as you were before.
Cookie, bring me a cigarette.
Do not you think he's smarter than us? ,Do not!
I know men.
Give me the "grandma" which you stole.
He learned that I stole it and returned it.
This is what I got.
I would like to have seen him when he did it to you.
I've never seen him whip a white man.
It is as big as a demon. , You do not have your guts!
I have half a bottle.
Enough for you and for me.
Why do you let him intimidate you like that?
Why do not you spit on his forehead?
Well, it's bigger than me.
But one of these days I'll get it.
My little bat!
You have the courage of a lion!
I have some liquor, but I was not going to tell that guy.
When they both sleep,
I'll sneak up the stairs.
I do not and I in the light of the moon.
I am going. I go wherever it is with you.
When you stroke my head like...
I feel like a kitten... with her belly full of milk.
Hears...
I wonder what would happen to you if "dead legs" found out.
Go back to your kennel.
Enough so that I and
I have a good drink.
And that makes us forget. , You pray them first!
Come here.
Hogan!
I want you to upload. , He loves you!
Why nobody...
It has been up there... before? , Maybe they are! , Maybe never come down! ,Goes up! ,Goes up! , Climb that rope!
Well, you've always wanted to know why I was here so long.
I created a yuyu with the natives to form a circle of 130 Kms... where no white or black man could enter or leave... without my authorization.
Well, I'm going to tell you because I need you.
I'm going to let you out of the circle.
- They are gone.
- But they will come back.
You're going to Cape Town, to a convent and you're going to bring a girl here.
- ? A girl?
- A woman.
Old enough to realize what is happening to him.
For 18 years I have built a fence around you.
A clean environment in body and soul... preparing it for this.
You're going to bring her back to her father.
A pr spera plantation of rubber.
She will be anxious enough to come!
He did not write to me any clingy and maudlin letters... full of desire to see his father. ,His father! ,His father!
Does that mean he's going to bring his own daughter here?
My daughter, not his, the man who stole my wife.
The man who kicks my column. , The man who mocks! , I know I became... half man!
But I followed them.
She died without recognizing me.
I caught the baby.
His baby, and he followed him.
Once I reached it.
Why do not I kill him?
Why would I give him a godly death?
That is what I expected. , You will suffer all that I have suffered!
You're flesh and blood, Gregg!
Degraded, corrupted! , Your name burning from
Camer n to Zanz ي bar!
- Gregg?
- That's why I lived here. , That's why I lived in this mud! , Rubbing your nose with those dirty natives! , Making my religion my own! , Being part of them! , Everything to be able to live on its own threshold... without him being able to see me!
Do you understand?
When do you want me to leave?
As soon as we get porters.
I could take some of our ivory and sell it.
Oh, no, friend...
There are tons of ivory down... and half will be yours when you bring her here.
But suppose she does not come.
I have planned all the details.
You are a great friend of your father.
A missionary from Rhodesia.
This will be your appearance.
We're going to miss Ann a lot.
How will I miss her!
But finally I'm going to see my father.
I'll be waiting for you with open arms.
All these years, dear friend...
He has been killing himself to work... to be able to provide... the sweetness of life to your child.
I have always wondered why he has never come to see me.
I will never forget the beautiful letter
I wrote to this convent 10 years ago... explaining that, with God's help, he was fertilizing the world, alone.
You, as a missionary, Mr. Babcock, he will realize the difficulties that means.
Yes, it's true.
But we can be happy... what your father, and my friend, has conquered for civilization.
Well, I have to go and say goodbye to everyone.
I hope my father loves me.
Fuzzy, listen to Big Boss.
Morning moon in Pantano Eight
Palmos come great convoy.
Great convoy Gregg.
A lot of ivory.
No white boss.
I do not speak.
"Ozeebee", great devil.
Scare a lot of black boys.
Big Boss send porters to bring ivory.
- Not speak.
- Not speak.
Big Boss eyes on
Fuzzy all the time. , Hide in forest!
Come here! , Hurry!
T pillar... white tongue.
I caught a lot of white tongue.
- Do not talk?
- Not speak.
Do not give me much sugar.
A lot of smoke stick.
Much exchange.
The Big Boss gives you...
- Do not talk, huh?
- Not speak.
I give you ,Calm! ,Calm!
Hears... , Never plug a waiter!
- Why do you plug it in?
- Use your eyes, he's a thief.
Let it serve as a warning. ,And you!
He will never see him again.
Hang it in the room as a warning to all blacks.
Then take it to the tribe.
Go, go!
I thought you had fled!
Do you want to tell me that you do not like pretty, cool swamps?
I admit there's no way out of this sewer.
You should know that I have tried it often.
Flint, I need a drink. , D ل melo!
Give a drink to the orita.
- You give it to me without thinking?
- Of course I do, my dear!
What is the reason for this sudden outburst of generosity?
Attrib it to my dearest.
Go ahead, be happy.
Now break that glass.
?What do you mean?
Who wants to drink after you?
I should have known that it was another trick to humiliate me!
- Break that glass!
- I will not break it! , If you knew how I hate you and despise you! , Night and day I thought about revenge, disgusting mat n!
My dear, for those sweet comments you can have another drink.
How proud I would be to your father if I could see you!
Your mind is more twisted and deformed than your body!
I am deformed in body and soul. , The swamp is healthy compared to you!
Hogan, put her in your room. , Let's cure your desire to flee!
It will hit you., It's half crazy!
One hundred lashes for each carrier who left the convoy.
They found this in a spear stuck in the throat of a carrier.
Gregg, if you want your ivory, come for it.
It's time to meet. Flint. , Flint!
I would like to put your hands on you.
It's only once!
Finally, I want to keep an eye on him.
This note means that you will let me pass.
- You will not risk...?
- , Even if it's the last thing you do!
I'm going to get that crippled thief out.
You can not do it if you have the entire Sholi tribe at your back.
130 Kms. Of ambushes and yuyu.
The young men will flee like flies.
Your only problem, Carl, is that you're a coward.
You're weak with the tools,
I want you to tie me up.
An ata d?
How much do you measure?
Is it for me? Around 1.50...
It's okay, make it 1.80.
Yes, 1.80... Who is it for?
He's not going to bury that native, right?
You will want to burn it as they always do.
I would not stand to be one of your women who are burned alive.
Do you ever stop gossiping?
Here, I want you to prepare this trick.
This will give the old pig and his rabble something to think about.
Where do we get a skeleton?
They never leave more than ashes.
It depends on you.
Get the skeleton.
An ax in the creek water could make your job easier.
The vultures will do the rest.
I'm getting very nostalgic!
The drums...
They come here all the time.
- Yes, he'll be here soon.
- ? ة I?? Who?
Some day I'm going to cover that mouth of yours and I'll put a nice tag inside.
Come on, clean that!
?Who is coming?? Who?
They have made the signal to the drum that a new white man has entered the circle.
Oh, a white man!
?Who is he?
That's what I want to find out.
That's why I sent him to be allowed to pass.
Do not you think maybe Gregg tries to pass me by to take me back?
- You like Gregg, huh?
- Oh, no, no!
I do not like it.
Devil, half of you is fire and the other half is lies.
Give me a little kiss, huh?
You're not mad at me, huh?
Come on come on...
We make peace, a lot of love...
Many new bracelets, huh?
I've already given you enough junk to open a store.
Tula wants more.
Tula always wants more.
T give me new facial creams, give me many new bracelets... and give me...
It's enough, it's too hot!
Get out of here.
Other men do not find too much heat for Tula. ,Outside!
Give me a drink! I want brandy.
- Who are you looking at?
- That's what I'm going to find out.
Where am I? This is Lapunga?
You are not less than 100 moons.
Only whites who flee the law come to this place.
What is your scam?
?Who are you to ask questions?
You think I'm drunk.
No, I've lived too long in the Congo for that.
You have been chewing roots of byang.
You are a drug addict.
And what if I am?
A man has to have something.
You have signs of a gentleman.
A professional, maybe. , M.D.! , F.R.C.S.!
How much it means in a dunghill like this.
So...
You're a doctor, huh?
In a village like this we need a doctor.
You are knocking on the wrong door.
Very unreliable.
Walking through the clouds one day... and crawling through the swamps in search of byang to the next.
How have you got here?
I came to help the government fight against drugs.
One day, I just stopped fighting.
Here I am.
Give him some brandy.
Thank you.
My name is Harris.
I am the cook.
My name is Kingsland and I am a disaster.
When you feel better, doctor,
I want you to prescribe me.
I have a kidney floating.
That's right, during the day it's fine, but at night he lets go of his anchor.
Can I prescribe now?
Suck lemons. , That's very weird!
Absolutely, citric acid is a cure for the floating kidney.
Well, if it heals me, I...
- I'll suck all the lemons in the jungle.
- Come on, get out of here.
Well, how are you feeling now, Doc?
That is what I needed.
It clears a little head.
Hey, what's your name?
In this territory it is my privilege to ask questions, not answer them.
Since you're so polite, I want a bed!
And porters and provisions to get to Lapunga.
Of that nothing.
You are going to stay here.
You'll see if you can do something with these things that...
They were called legs.
- How long have you been like that?
- 18 a.
- It's hard.
- I do not expect a cure.
But every now and then a pain hits me.
- I can alleviate it, but...
- , Pleasure!
Do I see visions or is it a white woman?
Portuguese.
Eight months without seeing a white woman.
I did not expect to find one here.
Once I was the only white woman in this place, but then came the woman with the disgusting hair.
Go back to your room.
I can choose to talk to the woman... , Go back to your room!
It's fine, I'm leaving.
- Well, a little hard, no, friend?
- I'm the only law here.
While you are my guest, remember it.
Tomorrow I'll be on my way to Lapunga.
Tomorrow the root will be gone and you will not have the strength of a rabbit.
There will be a burning hole in your lungs that only the root of Byang can heal.
That will be your fee, Doctor.
The root in payment for the services rendered.
Galen heals you, huh?
Do you know what I am?
I am a Siamese twin doctor.
I am a doctor and patient, all in one.
Today... the patient wins.
But tomorrow... tomorrow...
Ma ana never arrives.
?What happened to it?
When they begin to chew these things are finished. , I will cut off the tongue to the one who gives root of byang to this man!
I'll give him enough so he does not go crazy... until I finish what I need.
You will find lots to have fun here.
After tomorrow you will see a native burial of fire.
- The sacrifice of a living woman.
- ? What?
When a man dies, his closest wife, daughter or relative is buried with him.
- Do you allow that?
- Allow it?
I encourage it.
I have made them believe that
I am part of their religion.
?Why?
Because the voodo will bring me what I want.
I do not understand your purpose.
Even I have difficulties to understand myself.
?Who is she?
Go back to the ground, which is your place.
Cookie, give him your paper there.
- , Go there!
- That's no way to treat a lady.
?A lady?
This earth degrades men, but I'm not so rotten to see treating a white woman like that.
Are you going to become the hero?
No, just the remnants of manhood that I have left.
- Well, what are you going to do?
- I could give you a hand in the jaw!
Spirit, huh?
That is a novelty on this earth.
Very good, Doc.
Let's not talk more about that.
But I am very demanding with whom I eat.
I am also very demanding with whom I eat.
She will not like it. It's crazy!
Do you mind that I accompanied her?
What are you doing here?
It will be better for you if... if I do not speak.
I am your medical advisor.
I want to take a look.
I do not have much to brag about, more than port in a storm.
Malignant black fever.
- What are you taking for that?
- Brandy.
When can I get it?
- It's the only thing that keeps me alive.
- The worst possible thing for you.
I think I can help her.
It seems that our orita is going to have another romance!
He has already had many, one more will not be noticed.
Ann, come here!
Take this bottle of brandy and go back to your room. ,Just a moment!
Brandy will raise fever, will provoke the delirium and finally kill her.
- Here I make the recipes.
- Not while I'm here. , Cookie!
Bring another bottle of brandy.
?Why? I can have everything I want.
He says I can. ,Silence!
This thing will kill her.
- Has he sent you here?
- No, he has not sent me.
Well, why have you come? , Say it and go!
I have come to help her.
?Do you listen me?
Please, believe me.
There is something monstrous in all this.
You know, you asked me
I will help her.
?I?
Sometimes I reach the moon.
When I'm sober, which is not often.
- Where did you come from?
- Cape Town.
What are you doing here?
He sent me to find me.
I was going to see my father.
A missionary brought me.
- A missionary?
- , S ي! , The holy man!
Hogan... disguised.
Maybe I'm just running.
I'll wake up and go to the chapel.
I will see the nuns and the walls of the convent. , I have permission for this! , Listen, you must not!
How much does it make you were in the convent?
- , I do not know, two years!
- Calm calm.
- Have you been here since?
- Do not.
There was a house...
From a convent to a house in Zanz ي bar. ,I graduated!
Please, do not make me dig up the old graves! , I'm going to get her out of this! , And to get her away from that manic!
Have you heard me?
- , I do not believe you!
- Oh, yes, please!
- Hey, and who are you?
- I'm a doctor.
A fugitive , This is no more than a new kind of torture!
Give me hope a minute or two. , Another trick!
- No, I want to get her out of here.
- Sounds easy, does not it?
Well, it's better to be clear.
The cripple can prevent someone from leaving the yuyu circle.
I know, I've tried.
How is it called?
Ann Whitehall.
Knows...
Everything is easy in life, except death.
We played hide and seek, death and I, for a long time.
Ann, so cheme.
There was something in here that had been dead a long time.
That which was dead has risen from the moment I saw it.
And I'm going to get her out of here.
?He believes me? , Sure, I believe you!
- What is the use of believing a madman?
- Oh, give me a chance!
When I have a few days here
You will know what an opportunity is.
Let him not know that he wants to help me or give him food to the jungle.
Ann, I swear, I'm going to cure her! , And we will escape together!
You know, despite everything you have suffered... there is something, something infinitely sweet in you.
Something sweet, huh?
I already told you that I graduated.
But you're a friendly fool, and that's a novelty.
Maybe the rest is not so unpleasant.
What was that?
It sounds like the monkey waving its chains.
Do not let them catch you here!
Come on, I'll see if I can give you back a little health.
Can you give me back my respect?
If I know how to judge people, there is something you have never lost.
Good evening, Ann.
Doctor, please, quickly, quickly.
I think maybe a scorpion or centipede bit me., Look!
That does not look much like a bite.
I wake up with terrible pain.
There is no piercing, it is more like an ara azo.
So, how could it happen?
Maybe with this, huh?
You know women, huh?
You are very smart. ,But I like you a lot!
Goodnight.
?You do not like me?
There is no reason not to like me.
Then, why are you going to see her?
Why do not you come to me?
- That girl is very sick.
- Tula is also very sick.
He has heart problems for you.
That's very flattering, but I'm afraid I can not prescribe a cure.
Since you came here my heart goes like that.
Relája. ,Listen out!
I can get you a lot of byang root.
? Yes?
I'm not interested in those things anymore.
I've finished.
So you go crazy! Look... , I get it for you! ,I do not want it!
Maybe you'll take it tomorrow.
I told you I finished!
Keep him. You do not have to use it if you do not want to.
Good...
Maybe I should not... cut already.
- I do it easily, huh?
- , Clear!
Now you pay me...
You give me a kiss.
?All ready?
Everything ready, I pray.
Oh, poor Yorick, I knew him well.
I know that voice.
It's Harris, the cook.
It's fine, come on.
Let's see how you move.
They are going to give me chills under the skeleton.
Come on, come out., Turn it around! ,Close the door!
T and I are the only ones who know this.
If someone else finds out, it will be very bad for you.
You will have the dust at hand and
I will terrify those sweetbreads.
Everything seemed to work well.
All right, okay, except the palpitations of my intermittent heart.
Open that door.
Damn bárbara...
Why do not they avoid his misfortune?
It is a tender habit voodoo. Never burn a woman until the moon rises.
They are coming. , D ل melo! , If you ever find out, you'll kill me!
Have mercy, give it!
Take it, c gelo.
You know, we deal with it later, huh? , Now back!
Come here!
Do you know what they're going to do out there?
They are preparing for an ancient voodoo ceremony.
His religion is based on superstition.
They believe that by burning that woman, she will join her closest relative... purifying the spirits.
T, as a white man, you should stop him.
Stop it? No, dear,
I'm part of it.
I'm waiting for the day to sacrifice a white woman. ,You are a demon!
I wanted you to see this, dear.
It is part of your education. , I'm going to give you a whole bottle!
So you can join in spirit.
I'm not going to touch your brandy.
I do not want more!
That doctor has been influencing you, huh? , He at least has a spark of decency!
? Yes? Also a spark of skill.
That's why I keep it here.
I want to be as good as possible when your father arrives.
I wonder how it will be after all these years.
I wonder if that contempt will still be drawn on his lips.
- The sorcerers... They come!
- Bring my headdress!
They are sorcerers... Hogan!
Come here!
It's going to be a wild night, Hogan.
Enter the spirit.
Do you hear that Rago? , Cookie and you can take a bottle each!
All right, boss.
Where are you going, dear? Come here! , I wanted to give you a little drink!
- This will make you feel better, huh?
- , More!, More!
Later.
I thought you had lasted, huh?
The only man I need and you gorge on him.
I do not, I do not!
Go ahead, lie. It will be a long time until you speak again.
- Give me that wire!
- Oh, please, no! I will not do it anymore! , Get out!
- , Leave her alone!
- Hurry up or you'll be next.
Come here!
Come on, open your mouth.
Stick out the tongue. ,Come on! , S ل cala! , Stop, miserable!
Stop or I'll liquidate you! , Drop it, Flint, or fly your rotten head from your half dead casing! , Drop it!
I guess you've learned that from the natives.
Twisting a girl's tongue, right?
I think I'm going to enjoy the sound of lead crossing your skull, Flint.
A brave man. Look at him!
Hogan, I think you're going to be the first.
- Well, how about now, Doc?
- , it's okay with me!
If I did not need you, I would break your crazy head and throw it into the lime dump.
My messengers are already on their way to
Tuko with the medicine you want for me.
When you arrive here, you will operate.
I would not advise you to leave me near you with a knife.
No, not the way you are now.
But I'm going to cure you.
I'm going to get you up to the neck in the mud of the swamp... so that the leeches suck you until you're sober.
I'm going to puncture you and let the leeches do the rest. , Az car!, Az car!, Az car! ,The demon! How can you do this to a human being? ,Water! ,Water! , If you knew what that means! ,Water!, More water!
You should not have come.
Flint will find out and then... , Listen to the drums! , I know they miss me!
- , You have to go back!
- I do not care what happens to me.
I can not let you try to help me and not try to help you.
Oh, it was my duty, that's all.
Neither leeches matter anymore.
My body is Setting in motion.
You must go back before they find you here. ,Please!
No, I'm going to stay here.
No no... Oh, bless you to come!
It is a memory that I will carry until the day of my death.
Hurry, go there...
The drums are almost here.
No, I'm not leaving!
Eight men are coming.
When they entered the circle there was 23.
It seems that you are defecting.
By the time I get here
He will be almost alone. , Træme the 45, Tula!
Fuzzy say tribe...
"Father of white girl come".
Fuzzy say tribe...
"Father of a very sick white girl".
Fuzzy to say Motawamba...
"Great Chief Flint stay by tribal rules."
"If white father die, surrender girl to fire".
Fuzzy practice a lot with stick boom.
- Fuzzy, good man.
- Fuzzy, good man.
You feel better, right?
Yes, thanks to you.
The fever has almost disappeared.
Your hands have done it.
You know, they make me think about when I was child.
The hands of my mother.
I never knew mine.
In the convent, when the girls left with their families...
I was very melancholy.
I did not know why, since
I had never been outside.
So I invented an imaginary mother.
At night she would come talk to me.
I can hear it here now.
But now I feel sorry for me.
And that's not a nurse's privilege.
Thank you.
I think I'm going to sit down.
- She is with him again.
- Even better.
You will recover your strength and I will need you.
And if my kidney gets worse, maybe she'll take care of me. , Get out of here!
I'm on your last cross, Gregg.
Do not go.
I was going to close the shutters.
The sun will hit you in the eyes.
They only see you.
Ann... ,You know I love you!
S ي.
You shouted it a hundred times while you raved.
Y...
?Y?
It made me very happy.
And very sad for you.
For me?
I told you my life in... in Zanz ي bar.
?Your life?
I'm not worth cleaning your shoes.
We are an insignificant and desperate couple, right?
It is not what we have been.
It is what we are going to be.
You know, those nasty leeches, as horrible as they were,
They have taken away that terrible desire.
Now I want to be close to you, to do you well.
See you smile.
Love is a rare thing.
That's what I thought, hour after hour, while I watched you writhing with fever.
My heart almost drowned... praying for you to recover.
Ann, you do not love me!
You know what I know. ,I'm so happy!
Poor girl, you're exhausted.
You must go to rest.
You know, I should be taking care of you.
With my brain clear, I can see that you have done me a favor.
So I'm going to operate on you.
You are aware that you can not be cured.
I know. I want you to relieve this pain.
All right.
You are not doing this out of love. ,Not much!
I do not use you, Flint, you know.
You are a sick man and I am a doctor.
Have you taken the bath that I told you?
S ي.
I took it this morning.
Thanks for Remember.
I had not bathed this month and today we are at 31.
Well, as soon as the serum arrives here
I will be prepared.
Ten minutes from the pool now.
Fuzzy is on its last curve.
I have the hot water, sir.
I've scraped all the fat from above as you told me.
It's fine, put it on the counter.
- Where do you want me, Doc?
- At the same place.
I do not want it.
- How do you feel?
- All right.
- This is going to hurt.
- Hogan, give me a cigar.
Well, you're willing, that's for sure.
How long will I be prostrate?
34 hours.
?I'll lend you a hand?
The pain will disappear as soon as I relieve that pressure.
- Ann!
- , I do not need it!
I know, she has guts.
You can deal with sponges.
God knows that his hands are cleaner than Cookie's!
Oh, I do not know!
Ann, I'm going to need your help.
Take my instruments out of the mat.
I'm going to operate on Flint.
If I had known, I would have let them rust.
How he loves you!
You will have many reasons before I finish.
You are overpowering her!
- Correct 100%, Doc.
- , Deliberately!
?Why?? Why?
It is none of your business.
Steril ي zalos there.
Let's get rid of that vest, Flint.
Oh, I've never seen him so naked! , Fuzzy... good man!
He has lowered his record by 3 hours to go to Tuko and return.
How's it going for work, Doc?
To pick the mouth.
Here you have your medicine, Ann.
?What have you said?
- You already heard me.
- Your medicine?
- Exactly.
- Is not it for me?
Do not.
Everything I need for your job...
It's this knife.
- , Damn me!
- , It will be!
- The medicine was not for me?
- , Do not!
You deliberately lied! ,I hate liars! ,I also!
Well, I like your independence.
You are my kind of animal.
And I will keep this as my fee.
Well ahead. Let's do it.
- Give him a drink of brandy, Cookie.
- It's not a bad idea.
- Here, in my hands.
- A good brandy? ,Just a moment!
Take, ah...
Do you like to pray, Flint?
Ahead.
- I'm going to cut you right there.
- Very good, short!
Let me cut you.
He has always been very kind to me.
I would love to cut him. , Get out, parrot is asking!
I was kidding him not to think about the pain.
Tula, the light here.
Keep it firm.
Prepare with those sponges, Ann.
Blimey, I feel a frozen finger... counting from top to bottom the vertebrae of my column.
Now do not move. ,I already have it!
What would he have... stick boom?
Fuzzy keep two eyes on new white man all the time.
Two eyes, all time.
New white man entering.
If he tries to leave...
Fuzzy... shoot. , Boom! ,Kill!
Fuzzy watch.
- All time.
- All time.
Gregg is here, bending the last curve of the river.
When I get here
I want to be alone.
Keep Tula and the doctor out of the way.
I'm Gregg.
I am Flint.
Well, I'm glad to meet you.
? Yes?
Yes, you are t.
You are here to erase me from the map.
I've waited a long time for you to call me, Gregg.
What's your game, Flint?
If I explained it, the mystery would end, the fun would disappear.
I do not want that.
Are you going to hurt me?
I tried to retaliate more than once, but here you are invulnerable.
You can also try to roll back
Victoria Falls with your hands... if the suffering is here.
I've stopped your slave traffic.
Take away the ivory trade from your sector...
He made you renounce the native mutilators.
And so you wiped my pocket and put me in a lire with my government. , Exactly as I planned it!
- I'm curious to know why.
- Naturally.
You did not stop me for pitying the natives.
Purely egoistic motives.
Return the favor to the blacks.
That goes against the black-white law.
You know it's a dangerous game to put blacks against white people.
You're not white, Gregg.
The color of your skin does not count for me.
No n black made me the filthy of the white man.
Do you think I'm going to let you get away with this?
I hope not.
That would be like killing domesticated rabbits. , Enough to play cat and mouse n!
Come on, let go!
- Half of my body is dead.
- What a lame!
I want to show that half of m ي
It's better than t in full.
How outrageous is that contempt?
He has been my ally for years.
I have a purpose in life, to see that contempt give way to fear.
You still have not understood me, have you, Whitehall?
I will stand up.
It may stimulate your memory.
S ي...
Your eyes are the same.
But you have changed considerably.
You were pretty slender. , Rutledge! , After all these years!
The light begins to be made.
Oh, revenge?
No, revenge, no.
It's a dark, dark and disturbing effect.
?You see it?
"He is mocking."
Yes, I have it always in front of me.
Punish you became in an obsession.
Not for taking my wife.
Not to paralyze my spine with that kick.
Yes, you did it, my good friend!
I did not languish for the woman you took from me.
I did not claim revenge for your head. ,No no!
But you left me there, helpless, helpless... ,You made fun!
Gregg, with that mockery you made a weapon that will tear your heart out.
- , You are crazy!
- , Yes, a monoman!
Tied to an idea.
When you put your base in Imbimbia, I followed you and settled down in Lapunga.
I associated with the power that you can not resist.
You're going to get resistance in large doses.
In Imbimbia I am as powerful as you are here.
- , You'll never see Imbimbia again!
- Why, bandit half dead? , Pull your hand away from the gun or I'll tear your eyes out!
Oh, you have a battle in your hands!
Eight of my best Sholi are surrounding your house.
I know.
You made a mistake discovering yourself before me.
The next time I'll paralyze the rest.
Are you one of your Sholi?
S ي.
Ah ي hangs the skin... of a Sholi.
But my Sholi...!
It is gone.
Ann, come here!
I want you to smile at this man.
- Pretty, right, Gregg?
- Yes, but...
Beautiful eyes, delicate skin, wonderful figure.
- ? What does that have to do with me?
- You'll know soon.
For 18 years I kept her in a convent.
Safe, protected from sleaze.
Cleanses body and soul.
Then the Congo.
Obliged to the filth of a night house in Zanzibar.
Dragged to here through the swamps, by waters full of germs, soaked in brandy and here it is before you... , Full of fever, desperate, degraded!
I've done it, Gregg, do you hear it?
- , I've done!
- Flint, you're a hellish beast!
Remember it when your turn comes.
- ? Because you did?
- Still no answer.
Yes, there is!, You're going to tell me!
- , There is still no answer!
- , I'll find out, yeah!
I have to know what is behind this that sinks me like a weight...
Crushing my life.
You just called me a degraded woman, Flint. , In name I am, but in my heart never! , All the men I've met were beasts!
Only one has helped me,
He has shown me kindness.
It has made it possible for me to survive.
Although, why do I talk to you?
Kingsland believes in me.
- , I'm going to take it off!
- , Do not! , I will fight for that!
I will fight, do you hear me?
Kingsland is mine, all my love! , I will crawl to him on his knees and he will lift me up!
It's mine! Nobody can take it away from me! ,You can not!
You have deliberately turned me into what I am. , You are responsible!
That's it, smile!
That's why he fell to the ground to drag you like a snake.
You started a scorching hole for me.
The first night, the noise of the jungle. , Rain dripping and dripping in the tent!
Hot hairy hands touching and mistreating me!
Then the nightmare, that house!
- , You sent me to that!
- Yes, dear!
Do you think you can continue and continue with your atrocities without being returned?
Well, I will!
You will pay for it! ,I will revenge!, There will be a form, there will be a form!
Your daughter, Gregg.
Your daughter with my wife.
?My daughter? , This is what I expected!
And if something happened to you, there is a sacred native law... which says that the girl must be delivered to burn her at your funeral. , Your daughter, Gregg! ,lt's yours!, Yours! , The lies are not going to save you!
So I believed your wife when she told you she was going to give birth to a son of mine.
She said it to get revenge because you called her...
I called her exactly what she was!
I never saw your wife or you until the end of July... and that baby was born after Christmas Day.
- Lies and more lies!
- She is not my daughter.
It's yours, all yours, and I can prove it!
What more proofs can you want?
In your blind fury you did not stop to reason.
Your wife told me that I was going to give birth to a son of yours, but I took her away from you anyway.
Did you find out when I was born?
- Yes.
- Come on, I want the truth., The truth!
December 25.
Funny, if it was not so tricky.
My child.
My daughter.
She should never know.
He has suffered enough without knowing...
That his father is an irrational monster. , Something that deserves to crawl! , You are still responsible for this!
No, friend, it's your rotten, twisted mind.
You hit yourself.
The whole fight has left you... and I do not have to be afraid of you anymore.
I get out of here. ,Just a moment!
I've had enough!
- , Do not go out that door!
- , I do not accept your orders! , Do not go out that door! ,They are going to kill you! , Stay here!
Do not go out that door, do you hear me?
?Do you hear me? , Fuzzy! , Fuzzy!
I can not do it anymore!
The sordidness and humiliation of all this.
My brain is spinning in circles.
I can not think anymore!
What possible satisfaction...
Do you need to degrade me in front of that other man?
And what does he care?
You know how much I love you.
Maybe Gregg, the merchant, could help us.
Best, dear.
I feel that the end of the road is in sight.
Come on. , Reg ل licks a smile! , That's my girl! I like how you raise your mind.
I'm going to need your help tonight.
You have sent the message to
Fuzzy that the white man...
Must I have a safe conduct to Imbimbia?
I sent a messenger, but he has not returned.
I want to talk to you.
Have not you already said enough for a day?
How do you feel now, Ann?
You care how much I feel.
Ann, I'm going to send you away from here.
Time heals all.
It will help you to forget.
Do not trust me, right?
Hell, I do not blame you.
But I'm going to make him confide in me.
You still tremble.
Hogan!
Tripe brandy.
Take this, it will help you.
Leave that, you scoundrel!
You try to kill her with that thing.
The love of a woman, Doc...
There is no greater power.
When did you discover that?
When I killed him.
Have you become sentimental?
Do not...
It's just a pause to greet a sweet memory.
Fuzzy good man.
Do as Big Boss say.
Kill father of white girl.
How has the Almighty allowed something like this on this earth?
Look, that man is alive! ,Leave her!
Save the life of that man and save her to her... if you do not want to deliver it to the burial fire. , Man ي aco! ,Do what I say! , It's your only chance! Hogan!
Take him to that room., Hurry!
He is dead.
That means you will burn it and the girl goes too.
The natives will never catch it if I kill Flint.
He goes first.
My child.
My baby.
If I knew some day that you have forgiven me...
This is the first...
And last time I'm going to have you in my arms.
She's fine, Doc.
Before he comes back in s ي
I want to give you something.
Uncut gemstones valued at 20,000 louis.
T bad for her.
- She would not want your money.
- You will never know where to proceed.
C mprale a little happiness. , Drums of death!
- It's Matawomba.
- Yes.
How have they found out?
He has just exhaled his last breath.
- , Do not let me touch!
- Easy, Ann, nothing's wrong.
Recover your composure, dear.
We want to take a white man to fire.
Agree.
Let them take it. , Fuzzy!
They are going to take it to you!
They're going to burn my father!
It's okay, Ann, do not say anything.
Ann, please..., Esc chame! , You have to listen to me!
Ann...
I swear...
He is not your father.
Where is my father?
Your father is...
Your father died years ago.
Come on. Everything is fine, dear.
Hogan!, Cookie!
We're not going to give the girl to the blacks.
You already know what it means. ,Dynamite!
We will not have any chance.
There is an opportunity, I am going to give it to them.
Go with Cookie to where the ivory is stored.
Take Tula with you and wait to hear me.
White girl.
Say that you are ready.
Bring tribal advice here.
They're going to come for her.
Stop them, tell them the truth.
It's too late.
You would not believe me.
Give us rifles and we'll go for it.
I would not cross the premises.
All eyes are fixed on you.
S you have a chance to escape.
Below is a tunnel that leads under the river... in the heart of the swamp, unguarded native.
No human can live near him.
Fuzzy is the only one who has crossed it.
That is your only chance.
Bring Fuzzy and we'll start.
No, you have to stay here and celebrate the tribal ceremony.
They have to see it, they have to believe it.
I will try to delay them until you have a lot of smoke.
I explained to Ann that she must do everything I say.
Agree.
You have to do what Flint says... and celebrate the first part of the ceremony.
No, no, it's just another trick, more lies.
He swears he will help us to escape...
He has convinced me.
You also have to believe him.
How can I believe in him?
From the first day he had me in his corral.
Do you think I would risk... if I did not know he wants to get you out of this hole?
He is risking his life to get you out of here. , It's our only chance!
Everything ready for white girl.
Big Boss does not give girl for fire.
Fuzzy take white by t nel.
By poisonous swamp.
- , No no no!
- , Yes, Fuzzy must do!
Matawomba kill for this. , Big Boss do Fuzzy I ي der!
Give many rifles. Make rich.
For Great Chief I will do.
Take packages. Wait for ivory.
- Are you going to stay here alone?
- I'll have a lot of company.
- And when they discover that he's gone?
- Use your imagination.
You do not know fear,
I admit it to you.
Fear died with my legs.
Tell Ann I want to say goodbye to her.
Did he tell you what you have to do?
S ي.
If you stay here you have no chance.
It's one against a thousand to survive.
But it is an opportunity.
It is your only hope.
You have to keep fighting.
Fighting.
While I try to retain them.
I have caused you many bitter memories, but...
I hope you can forget. ,Good luck!
?Voucher?
I will try to remember what your value is.
Close the door.
You have to get out of here. I will tell you that you are not a believer.
Oh, God, if there is a God, just take it.
That girl with whom I have violated all Your laws and teachings.
Put her safe.
Give me the strength to stop them.
In the name of godliness, in the name of Your Son...
Amen.
Of course it's a small place on the coast of Sicily,
Nestled between cold hills... and where you can see an incredibly blue sea.
There is peace there. Oh, what peace!
What do you think, Ann? ,Horrible!
All right, I know.
The captain says he can do it.
- ? For real?
- Yes.
The engineer has a Bible, but he thought it was a dictionary.
?And good?
What do you think, Ann?
How do you do?
Mr. Carl Laemmle feels it would be a little unkind to present this picture without just a word of friendly warning.
We are about to unfold the story of Frankenstein, a man of science, who sought to create a man after his own image without reckoning upon God.
It is one of the strangest tales ever told.
It deals with the two great mysteries of creation, life and death.
I think it will thrill you.
It may shock you.
It might even horrify you.
So, if any of you feel that you do not care to subject your nerves to such a strain, now is your chance to...
Well, we've warned you.
Amen.
Down! Down, you fool!
Now.
Come on.
Hurry, hurry.
The moon's rising.
We've no time to lose.
Oh, careful!
There we go.
Here he comes!
He's just resting, waiting for a new life to come.
Here we are.
Look. It's still here.
Climb up and cut the rope.
No!
Go on. It can't hurt you.
Here's the knife.
Look out!
Here's the knife.
Here I come.
Is it all right?
The neck's broken.
The brain is useless.
We must find another brain.
That will do, gentlemen.
And in conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, here we have one of the most perfect specimens of the human brain that has ever come to my attention at the university.
And here, the abnormal brain of the typical criminal.
Observe, ladies and gentlemen, the scarcity of convolutions on the frontal lobe, as compared to that of the normal brain, and the distinct degeneration of the middle frontal lobe.
All of these degenerate characteristics check amazingly with the case history of the dead man before us, whose life was one of brutality, of violence and murder.
Both of these jars will remain here for your further inspection.
Thank you, gentlemen.
The class is dismissed.
Herr Victor Moritz.
Victor.
I'm so glad you've come.
What is it, Elizabeth?
Oh, you've heard from Henry.
Yes. The first word in four months.
It just came.
Victor, you must help me.
Why, of course I'll help you.
I'm afraid.
I've read this over and over again, but they're just words that I can't understand.
Listen.
"You must have faith in me, Elizabeth. Wait.
"My work must come first, even before you.
"At night, the winds howl in the mountains.
"There is no one here.
"Prying eyes can't peer into my secret."
What can he mean?
What does he say then?
"I am living in an abandoned, old watchtower,
"close to the town of Goldstadt.
"Only my assistant is here to help me with my experiments."
Oh, his experiments.
Yes, that's what frightens me.
The very day we announced our engagement, he told me of his experiments.
He said he was on the verge of a discovery so terrific that he doubted his own sanity.
There was a strange look in his eyes, some mystery.
His words carried me right away.
Of course, I've never doubted him, but still I worry.
I can't help it.
And now this letter.
All this uncertainty can't go on.
I must know.
Victor, have you seen him?
Yes. About three weeks ago.
I met him walking alone in the woods.
He spoke to me of his work, too.
I asked him if I might visit his laboratory.
He just glared at me and said he would let no one go there.
His manner was very strange.
Oh, what can we do?
Oh, if he should be ill...
Now, don't worry.
I'll go to Dr. Waldman,
Henry's old professor in medical school.
Perhaps he can tell me more about all this.
Oh, Victor, you're a dear.
You know I'd go to the ends of the Earth for you.
I shouldn't like that.
I'm far too fond of you.
I wish you were.
Victor.
I'm sorry.
Good night, Victor, and thank you.
Thank you.
Good night.
And don't worry. Promise?
I won't.
- Victor?
- What is it?
I'm coming with you.
But, Elizabeth, you can't do that!
I must! I'll be ready in a minute.
Herr Frankenstein is a most brilliant young man, yet so erratic, he troubles me.
I'm worried about Henry.
Why has he left the university?
He was doing so well, and he seemed so happy with his work.
Well, you know, his researches in the field of chemical galvanism and electro-biology were far in advance of our theories here at the university.
In fact, they had reached a most advanced stage.
They were becoming dangerous.
Herr Frankenstein is greatly changed.
You mean, changed as a result of his work?
Yes, his work.
His insane ambition to create life.
How? How?
Please tell us everything, whatever it is.
The bodies we use in our dissecting room for lecture purposes were not perfect enough for his experiments, he said.
He wished us to supply him with other bodies, and we were not to be too particular as to where and how we got them.
I told him that his demands were unreasonable, and so he left the university to work unhampered.
He found what he needed elsewhere.
Oh, the bodies of animals.
Well, what are the lives of a few rabbits and dogs?
You do not quite get what I mean.
Herr Frankenstein was interested only in human life.
First to destroy it, then recreate it.
There you have his mad dream.
Can we go to him?
You will not be very welcome.
Oh, what does that matter?
I must see him.
Dr. Waldman, you have influence with Henry.
Won't you come with us?
I'm sorry, but Herr Frankenstein is no longer my pupil.
But he respects you.
Won't you help us to take him away?
Very well, Fräulein. I've warned you.
But if you wish it, I will go.
Fritz!
Hello.
Have you finished making those connections?
Yes, they're done.
Well, come down then and help with these attachments.
We've lots to do.
Look out.
Fool!
If this storm develops as I hope, you will have plenty to be afraid of before the night's over.
Go on. Fix the electrodes.
This storm will be magnificent!
All the electrical secrets of heaven!
And this time we're ready, eh, Fritz? Ready.
Why, what's the matter?
Look!
There's nothing to fear. Look.
No blood, no decay.
Just a few stitches.
And look, here's the final touch.
- The brain you stole, Fritz.
- Yes.
Think of it.
The brain of a dead man, waiting to live again in a body I made with my own hands.
With my own hands.
Let's have one final test.
Throw the switches.
Good.
In 15 minutes, the storm should be at its height.
Then we'll be ready.
What's that?
There's someone there.
Quiet.
Send them away.
Nobody must come here.
Here! Cover this.
Whoever it is, don't let them in.
Leave them to me.
Of all times for anybody to come, now!
Think I'm going to let these people in?
Not much.
I'll show them, messing about at this time of night.
Got too much to do.
Wait a minute! All right! All right!
Wait a minute. I'm coming.
It's Dr. Waldman, Fritz.
You can't see him. Go away.
All right, knock, but you can't get in.
- Henry!
- Frankenstein!
- Henry!
- Frankenstein!
Henry!
- Open the door!
- Let us in!
Who is it? Who is it? What do you want?
You must leave me alone now!
It's Elizabeth. Open the door!
- Henry!
- Henry!
- What do you want?
- Open the door.
- Let us in!
- You must leave me alone.
Henry, at least give us shelter!
- What's all this nonsense of locked doors?
- Henry!
Elizabeth, please. Won't you go away?
Won't you trust me, just for tonight?
Oh, you're ill. What's the matter?
Nothing. I'm quite all right.
Truly, I am.
Oh, can't you see
I mustn't be disturbed?
You'll ruin everything.
My experiment is almost completed.
Wait a moment. I understand.
I believe in you, but I cannot leave you tonight.
You've got to leave!
Henry, you're inhuman!
You're crazy!
Crazy, am I?
We'll see whether I'm crazy or not.
Come on up.
Are you quite sure you want to come in?
Very well.
Forgive me, but I'm forced to take unusual precautions.
Sit down, please.
Sit down!
You too, Elizabeth.
Please.
A moment ago, you said I was crazy.
Tomorrow we'll see about that.
Don't touch that!
I'm sorry, Doctor, but I insist.
Please.
Dr. Waldman, I learned a great deal from you at the university about the violet ray, the ultraviolet ray, which you said was the highest color in the spectrum.
You were wrong.
Here in this machinery,
I have gone beyond that.
I have discovered the great ray that first brought life into the world.
Oh, and your proof?
Tonight you shall have your proof.
At first, I experimented only with dead animals and then a human heart, which I kept beating for three weeks.
But now,
I'm going to turn that ray on that body and endow it with life.
And you really believe that you can bring life to the dead?
That body is not dead.
It has never lived.
I created it.
I made it with my own hands from the bodies I took from graves, from the gallows, anywhere!
Go and see for yourself.
You, too.
Dead, eh?
Quite a good scene, isn't it?
One man crazy, three very sane spectators.
- Is everything ready?
- Yes!
Get the batteries.
Look. It's moving.
It's alive. It's alive.
It's alive.
It's moving. It's alive.
Oh, it's alive!
It's alive! it's alive!
It's alive!
Henry, in the name of God.
In the name of God!
Now I know what it feels like to be God!
Henry is well, but he's very busy.
He said he would get in touch with you soon.
Don't worry about him, Baron.
He'll be home in a few days.
You two have it all arranged, haven't you?
You think I'm an idiot, don't you?
But I'm not.
Anyone can see with half an eye that there's something wrong.
And I have two eyes, pretty good ones, at that.
Well, what is it?
You're quite mistaken, Baron.
What's the matter with my son?
What's he doing?
He's completing his experiments, that's all.
Why does he go messing around an old, ruined windmill, when he has a decent house, a bath, good food and drink and a darned pretty girl to come back to?
Will you tell me that?
Oh, Baron, you don't understand.
I understand perfectly well.
There's another woman, and you're afraid to tell me.
Pretty sort of experiments these must be.
Oh, but you're wrong.
And how do you know?
If you please, Herr Baron, the Burgomaster.
Well, tell him to go away.
But he says it's important.
Nothing the Burgomaster can say can be of the slightest importance.
Good day, Herr Baron. Fräulein.
Well, what do you want?
If it's trouble, go away.
I have trouble enough.
Oh, there's no trouble, sir.
What do you mean, "No trouble"?
There's nothing but trouble.
I brought you these flowers.
Thank you, Herr Vogel.
Both in my private and official capacities as Burgomaster...
Yes, yes, yes, yes, we know all about that, but what do you want?
Well, what I really want to know is, when will the wedding be, if you please?
Unless Henry comes to his senses, there'll be no wedding at all.
But, Herr Baron, the village is already prepared!
Well, tell them to unprepare.
Oh, but such a lovely bride.
Such a fine young man, the very image of his father.
Heaven forbid.
But, sir, everything is ready!
I know that.
Don't keep on saying so, you idiot.
There's nothing to cry about.
Good day, Miss Elizabeth.
Good day, Herr Moritz.
Good day, Herr Vogel.
Good day, Herr Baron.
And good riddance to you.
There you are.
You see how it is.
The whole village is kept waiting.
The bride is kept waiting.
And I am kept waiting.
Henry must come home, if I have to fetch him myself.
- No, no, Baron.
- What do you mean, "No, no"?
What about his work?
Stuff and nonsense!
What about his wedding?
There is another woman, and I'm going to find her.
Oh, come and sit down, Doctor.
You must be patient.
Do you expect perfection at once?
This creature of yours should be kept under guard!
Mark my words, he will prove dangerous!
Dangerous?
Poor old Waldman.
Have you never wanted to do anything that was dangerous?
Where should we be if nobody tried to find out what lies beyond?
Have you never wanted to look beyond the clouds and the stars, or to know what causes the trees to bud, and what changes a darkness into light?
But if you talk like that, people call you crazy.
Well, if I could discover just one of these things, what eternity is, for example,
I wouldn't care if they did think
I was crazy!
You're young, my friend.
Your success has intoxicated you.
Wake up and look facts in the face.
Here we have a fiend whose brain...
Whose brain must be given time to develop.
It's a perfectly good brain, Doctor.
Well, you ought to know.
It came from your own laboratory.
The brain that was stolen from my laboratory was a criminal brain.
Oh, well. After all, it's only a piece of dead tissue.
Only evil can come of it.
Your health will be ruined if you persist in this madness.
I'm astonishingly sane, Doctor.
You have created a monster, and it will destroy you!
Patience, patience.
I believe in this monster, as you call it, and if you don't, well, you must leave me alone.
But think of Elizabeth, your father.
Elizabeth believes in me.
My father never believes in anyone.
I've got to experiment further.
He's only a few days old, remember.
So far he's been kept in complete darkness.
Wait till I bring him into the light.
Here he comes.
Let's turn out the light.
Come in.
Come in!
Sit down.
Sit down!
You see? It understands.
Watch.
Take care, Herr Frankenstein!
Take care!
Shut out the light!
Sit down.
Go and sit down.
It understands this time.
It's wonderful.
Frankenstein! Frankenstein!
Where is it? Where is it?
Quiet, you fool!
Get away with that torch!
Quick!
Fetch the rope. Quick!
Stop kicking!
Get him to the cellar!
Shoot it! It's a monster!
Quiet. Quiet!
Cooperate!
You'll have the whole countryside on us!
Come away!
He has the strength of 10 men.
This is madness. Give me that.
Oh, come away, Fritz.
Leave it alone. Leave it alone.
Listen. What's that? Who's there?
It's Fritz!
Come on, Doctor. Quick. Hurry.
Get back.
Get back. Get back.
Quick. Quick!
He hated Fritz.
Fritz always tormented him.
Come, come. Pull yourself together.
What can we do?
Kill it, as you would any savage animal.
We must overpower him first.
Get me a hypodermic needle.
- It's murder.
- It's our only chance.
In a few minutes he'll be through that door.
Come quick. Hurry.
- Got it?
- Yes.
Here it is. It's very strong.
Half-grain solution.
Good. Now, then.
You stand there.
When he goes toward you,
I will make the injection in his back.
Right.
- Ready?
- Yes.
Get back. Back!
Dr. Waldman? Dr. Waldman!
Are you hurt?
No, no, I'm all right.
It's nothing.
See who's at the door.
What's happening here?
Elizabeth and your father are coming up the hill to see you.
- You must keep them out.
- Too late.
They must not see that.
Here, quick, give me a hand.
Quick.
Down here.
Henry, you better hurry upstairs and get that blood off your face before your father and Elizabeth get here.
All right.
Well, pretty sort of place for my son to be in, I must say.
Is that the front door?
Yes, this is it.
Why,
I don't like it, but here goes.
Why, that...
There doesn't seem to be anybody in the place.
God!
What a forsaken place here.
You're trying to burn it down?
What's that for, eh?
What's the matter with you?
You look as though you've been kicked by a horse.
- Where's Henry?
- Why...
Well?
He can't be disturbed just now.
Oh, can't he?
I'll soon settle that nonsense.
Victor, where is he?
This place seems to drive everybody crazy. I...
Good heavens, what's that?
I beg your pardon.
I am Dr. Waldman.
Oh, are you?
I'm Baron Frankenstein.
Perhaps you know what all this tommyrot's about.
I'll be shot if I do.
I would advise you to take Henry away from here at once.
What do you suppose I'm here for, pleasure?
Where are you, my dear?
Oh, there you are.
Let's go and see what's up the awful stairs.
I don't know how the deuce
I'm going to get up them.
Just watch me. Do the trick.
Leave them alone.
No banisters or anything else.
God bless his soul.
How much further?
Come in.
Henry.
Elizabeth.
Henry!
Victor, Dr. Waldman, come quickly!
My dear, what have they done to you?
Poor, poor, Fritz.
It's all my fault.
- Get him on the sofa.
- Come on.
Oh, my boy.
Thank you.
Have you got any brandy?
- I did it.
- Quick, quick, quick, quick.
Here, I'll do that.
Come on, boy.
Now, now, now, drink. Drink this.
There. There, that's better.
I'm going to take you home with me, Henry.
No, I can't. My work.
What will happen to the records of my experiment?
We will preserve them.
- And... 
- I will see that it is painlessly destroyed.
- No.
- Yes, yes. Leave it all to me.
Poor Fritz. All my fault.
There, Henry.
You can't do any more now.
You must come home until you get well again.
You'll soon feel better when you get out of here.
It's like heaven, being with you again.
Heaven wasn't so far away all the time, you know.
I know, but I didn't realize it.
My work...
Those horrible days and nights.
I couldn't think of anything else.
Henry.
You're not to think of those things anymore.
You promised.
All right. Let's think about us.
When will our wedding be?
Let's make it soon.
As soon as you like.
For three generations, these orange blossoms have been worn at our weddings.
Your great-grandfather wore this, Henry.
Looks as good as new now, eh?
- Thank you. 
- And here.
Here's one to make the best man look still better.
Thank you, sir.
Thirty years ago,
I placed this on your mother's head, Henry.
Today you'll make me very happy by doing the same for Elizabeth.
And I hope in 30 years time, a youngster of yours will be carrying on the tradition.
And now, how about a little drink, eh?
Come on.
My grandfather bought this wine and laid it down.
My grandmother wouldn't let him drink it.
Oh, bless her heart.
Here's to your very good health.
Well, you all full?
Yes? Come along.
Here's a health to a son of the house of Frankenstein.
A son to the house of Frankenstein.
Here's a jolly good health to young Frankenstein.
Young Frankenstein.
Here, Hyde.
Give the servants some champagne.
This stuff's wasted on them.
Well, well, well, well.
Go on, mop it up, mop it up.
It'll do you good.
To the house of Frankenstein.
To the house of Frankenstein.
Thank you.
Now, then, now be off about your business.
Listen. Listen to them.
The boys and girls are busy, my dear.
It's extraordinary how friendly you can make a lot of people on a couple of bottles of beer.
Tomorrow they'll all be fighting.
No doubt.
They're calling for you, Baron.
Well, I suppose I'd better show myself.
Make a little talk.
Quiet!
Thank you all very much indeed.
I am very pleased to see you all, and I hope there's plenty of beer.
At all events there's lots more where that came from.
You stay here, Maria.
I'll just take a look at my traps.
Then we'll go to the village and have a grand time, huh?
- You won't be long, Daddy?
- Oh, no, no.
If Hans comes by, tell him I'll be back soon?
Daddy, won't you stay and play with me a little while?
I'm too busy, darling.
You stay and play with the kitty, huh?
Bye, Daddy.
Goodbye.
Be a good girl now.
Come on, kitty.
Who are you?
I'm Maria.
Will you play with me?
Would you like one of my flowers?
You have those, and I'll have these.
I can make a boat.
See how mine floats?
No, you're hurting me! No!
They're having a wonderful time, aren't they?
Henry.
Elizabeth.
Oh, how lovely you look.
But you shouldn't be here.
I must see you for a minute.
Well, what's the matter?
Could you leave us for a moment?
Why, of course.
Well, what is it?
Oh, I'm so glad you're safe.
Safe? Of course I'm safe.
But you look worried.
Is anything wrong?
No.
No, forget my foolishness.
It was just a mood.
There's nothing the matter.
Of course there isn't.
Henry, I'm afraid, terribly afraid.
Where's Dr. Waldman?
Why is he late for the wedding?
Oh, he's always late.
He'll be here soon.
Something is going to happen.
I feel it.
I can't get it out of my mind.
You're just nervous.
All the excitement and preparation.
No, no, it isn't that.
I felt it all day.
Something is coming between us.
I know it. I know it!
Sit down and rest.
You look so tired.
If I could just do something to save us from it.
From what, dear? From what?
I don't know.
If I could just get it out of my mind.
Oh, I'd die if I had to lose you now, Henry.
Lose me? Why, I'll always be with you.
Will you, Henry? Are you sure?
I love you so.
Sure.
How beautiful you look.
Henry! Henry!
- What's that? What's that?
- Henry! Henry!
-Henry! Dr. Waldman! Dr. Waldman!
- What about Dr. Waldman?
Henry, don't leave me.
Don't leave me.
No, darling, you stay here.
Henry. Henry!
Dr. Waldman's been murdered in the tower.
The monster?
He's been seen in the hills terrorizing the mountainside.
He's in the house.
He's upstairs!
Oh, God!
It's in the cellars.
It's Elizabeth. Come on.
Someone open the door!
Elizabeth.
Where is it?
- Don't let it come here.
- No, no, no, darling.
- Don't let it come here.
- It's all right.
Don't let it come here.
It's all right, darling.
It's all right.
Oh, look! Look, Maria!
Silence! Silence!
Silence. What is it? What is it?
Maria, she's drowned.
My poor man, why do you bring her here to me?
But she has been murdered.
Silence! I'll see that justice is done!
Who is it?
How is Elizabeth now?
I don't know.
She's still in a daze.
Just looks at me and says nothing.
- It's maddening.
- Easy, old man. She'll be all right.
- Our wedding day.
- Steady.
Your wedding will only be postponed a day at most.
A day? I wonder.
What do you mean?
There can be no wedding while this horrible creation of mine is still alive.
I made him with these hands, and with these hands, I'll destroy him.
- I must find him.
- I'll go with you.
No. You stay here and look after Elizabeth.
I leave her in your care, whatever happens.
You understand? In your care.
Quiet! Quiet!
Quiet!
Ludwig, you will search the woods.
Those are your group.
- We'll get him.
- Quiet!
Herr Frankenstein, you will take to the mountains.
Those are your people.
I will lead the third group by the lake.
Remember, remember, get him alive if you can, but get him!
Quiet!
Search every ravine, every crevice, but the fiend must be found!
- Are you ready?
- Yes!
Then light your torches and go!
- Stop! 
- Stop, men.
Frankenstein, mountains. Ludwig...
Lake party, this way!
Come on, men!
Come on, boys. Keep together.
Now, you search there.
The rest, come with me.
Go over there! Go on.
Come on, men! Come on! Come on!
Herr Frankenstein! Herr Frankenstein!
Come on, men!
Hurry up. This way.
Which way?
Which way did he go?
Hans, which way did he go?
Tell me. Tell me!
Over there.
You stay here and take care of him.
The rest, follow me.
Come on. Come on, quick!
Come on! Come on!
No, come back. This way!
Herr Frankenstein!
Herr Frankenstein! Where are you?
I think he's up there.
Come on, follow him. Follow him.
Follow him. Quick!
Hello!
There.
Fire. Fire!
Help! Help!
Listen!
- Help!
- It's Frankenstein.
That way!
This way. Come on.
Hurry. Hurry!
There! Turn the hounds loose!
Come on! Come on!
Once more.
There he is! The murderer!
Kill him!
Frankenstein?
Bring him down to the village, and let's take him home.
Burn the mill!
Burn the mill. Burn it.
- Have you got it?
- Yeah. Come on. Hurry.
Hurry up.
Quiet, quiet.
Well, go ahead and knock.
Well, well, well.
What's all this?
What do you want, eh?
What's this?
If you please, Herr Baron, we thought that Mr. Henry could do with a glass of his great-grandmother's wine.
Fine old lady, my grandmother.
Very foreseeing of her to prevent my grandfather drinking this.
Mr. Henry doesn't need this.
Well, as I said before,
I say again.
Here's to a son to the house of Frankenstein.
Indeed, sir. We hope so, sir.
How beautifully dramatic.
The crudest, savage, exhibition of nature at her worst, without, and we three, we elegant three, within.
I should like to think that an irate Jehovah was pointing those arrows of lightning directly at my head.
The unbowed head of George Gordon,
Lord Byron, England's greatest sinner.
But I cannot flatter myself to that extent.
Possibly those thunders are for our dear Shelley.
Heaven's applause for England's greatest poet.
- What of my Mary?
- She is an angel.
- You think so?
- (thunder)
You hear?
Come, Mary. Come and watch the storm.
You know how lightning alarms me.
Shelley, darling, will you please light these candles for me?
Mary, darling.
Astonishing creature.
- I, Lord Byron?
- Frightened of thunder, fearful of the dark.
And yet you have written a tale that sent my blood into icy creeps.
Look at her, Shelley. Can you believe that lovely brow conceived of Frankenstein?
A monster created from cadavers out of rifled graves.
- Isn't it astonishing?
- I don't know why you should think so.
What do you expect?
Such an audience needs something stronger than a pretty little love story.
So why shouldn't I write of monsters?
No wonder Murray's refused to publish the book. His public would be shocked.
It will be published, I think.
Then, darling, you will have much to answer for.
The publishers did not see that my purpose was to write a moral lesson of the punishment that befell a mortal man who dared to emulate God.
Whatever your purpose was, I take great relish in savouring each separate horror.
I roll them over on my tongue.
Don't, Lord Byron.
Don't remind me of it tonight.
What a setting in that churchyard to begin with!
The sobbing women, the first clod of earth
on the coffin. That was a pretty chill.
Frankenstein and the dwarf stealing
the body out of its new-made grave.
Cutting the hanged man down from
the gallows, where he swung in the wind.
The cunning of Frankenstein
in his mountain laboratory,
picking dead men apart and
building up a human monster
so fearful and so horrible that only
a half-crazed brain could have devised.
And then the murders,
the little child who drowned.
Henry Frankenstein himself
thrown from the top of the burning mill
by the very monster he had created.
And it was these fragile white fingers that penned the nightmare.
Ah! You've made me prick myself, Byron.
It's bleeding.
There, there. I do think it a shame, Mary, to end your story quite so suddenly.
That wasn't the end at all. Would you like to hear what happened after that?
I feel like telling it.
It's a perfect night for mystery and horror.
The air itself is filled with monsters.
I'm all ears. While heaven blasts the night without, open up your pits of hell.
Well, then, imagine yourselves standing by the wreckage of the mill.
The fire is dying down.
Soon the bare skeleton
of the building rolls over,
the gaunt rafters against the sky.
(yelling)
Well, I must say, that's the best fire
I ever saw in all me life.
- What are you cryin' for?
- It's terrible.
I know. But after all them murders and poor Mr Henry being brought home to die,
I'm glad to see the monster roasted to death before my very eyes.
It's too good for him.
It's all the devil's work, and you'd better cross yourself quick before he gets you.
Come along, come along. It's all over.
Get back to your homes and go to sleep.
There it goes again.
It ain't burnt out at all.
- There's more yet.
- Isn't the monster dead yet?
It's high time every decent man and wife was in bed.
That's his insides caught at last.
Insides is always the last to be consumed.
Move on. You've had enough excitement for one night.
This strange man you call a monster is dead.
Monster, indeed!
You may thank your lucky stars they sent for me to safeguard life and property.
Why didn't you safeguard those drownded and murdered?
Come, now. We want no rallying, no riots.
- Who's riotin'?
- Move on, move on.
Good night all, and pleasant dreams.
Ah, pleasant dreams yourself.
Thinks he's everybody just because he's a burgomaster. Huh!
Poor Mr Henry. He was to have been married today to that lovely girl Elizabeth.
Cover him up. Someone must break the news to the poor girl.
Ride as fast as you can to the castle, and tell the old Baron Frankenstein we are bringing his son home.
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, shut up.
Come home, Hans.
The monster is dead now.
Nothing could be left alive in that furnace.
Why do you stay here?
I want to see with my own eyes.
Oh, Hans, he must be dead.
And, dead or alive, nothing can bring our little Maria back to us.
If I can see his blackened bones,
I can sleep at night.
Come back, Hans!
You will be burned yourself!
Maria drowned to death and you burned up! What should I do then?
No!
(growls)
Hans. Hans!
Where are you? Hans!
Are you all right?
I hear you. Here, give me your hand, Hans.
Here.
(screams)
(growls)
(screams)
(bangs on door)
Oh, heaven, what is this?
Henry? Tell me.
Oh, milady, how can we tell you?
Bring him in.
- Albert.
- What do you want?
It's alive. The monster, it's alive!
- Ah, shut up, you old fool.
- I saw it.
It ain't turned to no skeleton at all.
It lived right through the fire.
Ah, go bite your tongue off.
We don't believe in ghosts.
Nobody'll believe me.
All right, I'll wash my hands of it.
Let 'em all be murdered in their beds.
- Speak to me, Henry.
- Oh, milady, he'll never speak again.
I was foretold of this.
I was told beware my wedding night.
Oh, look, milady! He's alive!
Henry, darling.
Elizabeth.
Oh, what a terrible wedding night.
You can go to bed now, Mary.
- You'll soon be better.
- I feel almost myself again.
When you're strong enough, we'll go away and forget this horrible experience.
Forget? If only I could forget.
But it's never out of my mind.
I've been cursed for delving into the mysteries of life.
Perhaps death is sacred, and I've profaned it.
For what a wonderful vision it was.
I dreamed of being the first to give to the world the secret that God is so jealous of.
The formula for life.
Think of the power to create a man.
And I did. I did it. I created a man.
And who knows? In time I could have trained him to do my will.
I could have bred a race. I might even have found the secret of eternal life.
Henry, don't say those things. Don't think them. It's blasphemous and wicked.
We are not meant to know those things.
It may be that I'm intended to know the secret of life.
It may be part of the divine plan.
No, no. It's the devil that prompts you.
It's death, not life, that is in it all and at the end of it all.
Listen, while you've been lying here, tossing in your delirium, I couldn't sleep.
And when you rave of your insane desire to create living men from the dust of the dead, a strange apparition has seemed to appear in the room.
It comes, a figure like Death. And each time it comes more clearly, nearer.
It seems to be reaching out for you, as if it would take you away from me!
There it is. Look.
- There.
- I see nothing, Elizabeth. Where?
There's nothing there.
There! There! It's coming for you!
Nearer! Henry! Henry! Henry! Henry!
(laughs hysterically) Henry!
(banging on door)
Albert! Drat the man.
He's never here when he's wanted.
- What's the good of footmen anyway?
- (bell rings)
All right. All right!
Don't knock the castle over!
We're not all dead yet.
- There's nobody at home.
- Let me in, my good woman.
I know the young
Baron Frankenstein is at home.
He's sick. He's in his bed, where all decent folk should be at this time of night.
Tell him that Dr Pretorius is here on a secret matter of grave importance, and must see him alone, tonight.
Dr Pretorius?
Pretorius?
- What was it? What was the name?
- Dr Pretorius.
There ain't no such name.
Now, you stay there.
- Who's there?
- It's Minnie, milady.
(Henry) Oh, come in.
It's Dr Pretorius.
He says he wants to see the master. Most insistent.
Pretorius?
He's a very queer-looking old gentleman, sir.
And must see you, on a secret, grave matter, he said.
Tonight. Alone.
- Bring him in.
- Henry, who is this man?
Dr Pretorius.
Baron Frankenstein now, I believe?
Won't you come in, Doctor?
I trust you will pardon this intrusion at so late an hour.
I would not have ventured to come, had I not a communication to make which I suspect may be of the utmost importance to yourself.
This is Professor Pretorius. He used to be
Doctor of Philosophy at the university.
- But, uh...
- But was booted out.
Booted, my dear Baron, is the word.
For knowing too much.
Henry's been very ill, Professor.
He shouldn't be disturbed.
I am also a doctor, Baroness.
Why have you come here tonight?
My business with you, Baron, is private.
Elizabeth, please.
I do hope he won't upset Henry.
- What do you want?
- We must work together.
Never. This is outrageous.
I'm through with it.
I'll have no more of this hell-spawn.
As soon as I'm well,
I'm to be married, and I'm going away.
I must beg you to reconsider.
You know, do you not, that it is you, really, who are responsible for all those murders?
There are penalties to pay for killing people.
And with your creature still at large in the countryside...
Are you threatening me?
Don't put it so crudely.
I had ventured to hope that you and I together, no longer as master and pupil, but as fellow scientists, might probe the mysteries of life and death...
Never. No further.
...and reach a goal undreamed of by science.
I can't make any further experiments.
I've had a terrible lesson.
That is sad, very sad.
But you and I have gone too far to stop.
Nor can it be stopped so easily.
I also have continued with my experiments.
That is why I am here tonight.
You must see my creation.
Have you also succeeded in bringing life to the dead?
If you, Herr Baron, will do me the honour of visiting my humble abode,
I think you will be interested in what I have to show you.
After 20 years of secret scientific research, and countless failures,
I also have created life, as we say, in God's own image.
I must know. When can I see it?
I thought you might change your mind.
Why not tonight? It is not very late.
- Is it far?
- No, but you will need a coat.
I think your coachman had better wait here.
Won't you sit down, Herr Baron?
Before I show you the results of my trifling experiments,
I would like to drink to our partnership.
Do you like gin? It is my only weakness.
To a new world of gods and monsters.
Creation of life is enthralling, distinctly enthralling, is it not?
I cannot account precisely for all that I am going to show you.
But perhaps now that you are my partner, you can.
My experiments did not turn out quite like yours, Henry.
But science, like love, has her little surprises, as you shall see.
Good heavens, Doctor. What are these?
There is a pleasing variety about my exhibits.
My first experiment was so lovely that we made her a queen.
Charming, don't you think?
Then, of course, we had to have a king.
Now he's so madly in love with her that we have to segregate them.
Now now. I have to be very careful with the king.
Now, behave.
My next production looked so disapprovingly at the other two that they made him an archbishop.
He seems to be asleep.
I must wake him up.
The next one is the very devil.
Very bizarre, this little chap.
There's a certain resemblance to me, don't you think? Or do I flatter myself?
I took a great deal of pains with him.
Sometimes I have wondered whether life wouldn't be much more amusing if we were all devils, and no nonsense about angels and being good.
Oh, there's the king out again.
Even royal amours are a nuisance.
(squeaking)
(blows whistle)
Poor Archbishop. He has his hands full.
There. That'll keep you quiet.
My little ballerina is charming, but such a bore.
She'll only dance to
Mendelssohn's "Spring Song", and it gets so monotonous.
My next is very conventional, I'm afraid.
But you can never tell how these things will turn out.
It was an experiment with seaweed.
Normal size has been my difficulty.
You did achieve size.
I need to work that out with you.
But this isn't science.
It's more like black magic.
You think I'm mad. Perhaps I am.
But listen, Henry Frankenstein, while you were digging in your graves piecing together dead tissues,
I, my dear pupil, went for my material to the source of life.
I grew my creatures, like cultures.
Grew them as nature does, from seed.
But, still, you did achieve results that I have missed. Now, think.
What a world-astounding collaboration we should be, you and I, together.
No. No, no, no.
Leave the charnel house and follow the lead of nature, or of God, if you like your Bible stories.
Male and female, created He them.
Be fruitful and multiply.
Create a race, a man-made race upon the face of the earth. Why not?
I daren't. I daren't even think of such a thing.
Our mad dream is only half realised.
Alone you have created a man.
Now together we will create his mate.
You mean...?
Yes, a woman.
That should be really interesting.
(cries out)
Please don't touch me!
- There she is! Quick!
- (screams)
There he is. Shoot.
Run to the village, quick.
It's the monster. Tell the burgomaster.
- What is it now?
- The monster! He's in the woods.
Get the bloodhounds. Raise all the men you can, lock the women indoors and wait for me.
Now then! Monster, indeed!
I'll show him. Follow me.
(growls)
Where is he?
Bind him securely.
I don't want anything slipshod.
Tie his feet first. His feet first!
I get no cooperation. None at all.
Have you got him? That's what
I want to know. Have you got him?
Of course we've got him, my good woman.
A good job too.
Mind he don't get loose again.
He might do some damage and hurt somebody.
- Bring him down when you've bound him.
- You want any help there? I'll bind him!
Now take him down to the old dungeon and put him in chains.
There you are.
Find some rope and tie him up.
Come on, then. Get back to your work.
Keep still.
That's quite enough. Come and lock your doors. We can't take all day over this.
I'd hate to find him under my bed at night.
He's a nightmare in the daylight, he is.
Get away, there! Clear that window!
Hah! You mind your own business and see he doesn't get out. He's dangerous.
Now I can get back to more important duties.
- Way past our hours.
- Hm?
- The night, sir.
- Monster, indeed.
Tush, tush.
(growls)
He's loose! Shoot him!
Help! He's loose!
Go to your homes.
Just an escaped lunatic.
Merely wanted someone to handle it, that's all. Quite harmless.
Shoot him! Why don't you shoot him?
Where's Frieda?
Frieda! Frieda!
- Frieda? Where's Frieda?
- She just left.
- Oh, look!
- (screams)
Frieda! Oh, what have they done to you?
(terrible scream)
Mrs Newman. Oh! Come on!
(moaning)
- Poor old Newman.
- Where's his wife, Frau Newman?
Frau Newman.
- Frau Newman!
- Frau Newman!
Frau Newman!
(moaning)
There's another one in there.
- Frau Newman.
- (gasps)
Aurora, you stay close to me.
We'd better get away from these parts.
- It isn't safe.
- Why?
I'm frightened. The monster.
Ah, there's no danger. He's safe in jail and they'll keep him there.
Where's the pepper and salt?
We got no pepper and salt.
All right, Mother. I'll get it.
Don't worry. You shall have your meat.
Ah.
(sniffs)
- (grunts)
- (screams)
Get away from there.
(cries)
(growls)
(# violin plays Schubert's "Ave Maria")
(small grunts of pleasure)
Who's there?
(growls)
Who is it?
You're welcome, my friend, whoever you are.
Who are you?
I think you're a stranger to me.
I cannot see you. I cannot see anything.
You must please excuse me, but I am blind.
(small grunts)
Come in, my poor friend.
No one will hurt you here.
If you're in trouble, perhaps I can help you.
But you need not tell me about it if you don't want to.
- What's the matter?
- (growls)
You're hurt, my poor friend.
Come.
Sit down.
Now tell me, who are you?
(faint moans)
I don't understand.
Can you not speak?
It's strange.
Perhaps... perhaps you're afflicted too.
I cannot see and you cannot speak.
Is that it?
If you understand what I'm saying, put your hand on my shoulder.
That is good.
No, you stay here.
I'll get you some food.
We shall be friends.
I have prayed many times for God to send me a friend.
It's very lonely here, and it's been a long time since any human being came into this hut.
I shall look after you, and you will comfort me.
Now you must lie down, and go to sleep.
Yes, yes, now you must sleep.
Our Father, I thank thee, that, in thy great mercy, thou hast taken pity on my great loneliness.
And now, out of the silence of the night, hath brought two of thy lonely children together, and sent me a friend to be a light to mine eyes and a comfort in time of trouble.
Amen.
And now for our lesson.
Remember, this is bread.
Bread.
Bread.
And this is wine... to drink.
- Drink.
- Drink.
Good. Good.
We are friends, you and I.
- Friends.
- Friends.
- Good.
- Good!
And now for a smoke.
(laughs)
No, no. This is good.
Smoke. You try.
Smoke.
Good, good.
Good.
Before you came, I was all alone.
It is bad to be alone.
Alone.
Bad.
Friend. Good. Friend. Good.
Now, come here.
And what is this?
This is wood for the fire.
Wood.
- And this is fire.
- (growls)
No, no. Fire is good.
Fire no good.
There is good and there is bad.
Good. Bad.
Good.
Music?
(knocking)
Can you tell us how to get out of this wood? We've lost our way.
Come in, friends, and rest a while.
- Look.
- It's the monster.
(growls)
What are you doing? This is my friend.
Friend? This is the fiend that's been murdering half the countryside.
Good heavens, man, can't you see?
Oh, he's blind.
He isn't human. Frankenstein made him out of dead bodies.
(growls)
My friend. Why do you do this?
Friend.
Look.
(screaming)
(growls)
Which way did he go?
This way! He's gone this way!
Friend.
(tapping)
(rattling)
- I can smell the ghosts already.
- I never could stand graves.
Shut up and follow me.
Read the inscription. What does it say?
"Died 1899. Maddalena Ernestine, beloved daughter of..."
Oh, never mind that. How old was she?
"Aged 19 years, three months."
Well, that's the one. Get to work.
- What are you waiting for?
- Mercy on us.
- You want me to send you to the gallows?
- Could be no worse than this.
- Well, are you ready?
- Yes.
Here goes.
Pretty little thing, in her way, wasn't she?
I hope her bones are firm.
- It seems lighter now.
- Yes.
Well, Doctor, I guess that's all for tonight.
- Can we go home now?
- Yes. I shall wait here for a bit.
I rather like this place.
- Be careful nobody sees you leave.
- We know.
- And leave me that lantern down there.
- All right, all right.
If there's more like this, what do you say, pal?
We give ourselves up and let 'em hang us?
- That goes for me too.
- This is no life for murderers.
(laughs)
I give you the monster.
(laughs)
Oh.
I thought I was alone. Good evening.
Smoke.
- Friend.
- Yes, I hope so.
Have a cigar. They are my only weakness.
Good, good.
Drink. Good.
Good.
You make man like me?
No. Woman.
- Friend for you.
- Woman?
Friend. Yes.
I want friend. Like me.
I think you can be very useful.
And you will add a little force to the argument, if necessary.
Do you know who Henry Frankenstein is?
And who you are?
Yes. I know.
Made me from dead.
I love dead.
Hate living.
You're wise in your generation.
We must have a long talk, and then
I have an important call to make.
Woman. Friend.
Wife.
That Dr Pretorius is here again, sir.
There, I knew it.
- Send him away. I won't see him.
- I certainly will.
Good evening, Henry.
Baroness, I've not yet had the opportunity of offering you my congratulations on your marriage.
- Pray accept them now.
- Dr Pretorius.
I don't know what your business is but, whatever it may be,
I tell you frankly that I am not frightened of it or of you.
Henry's been very ill. He's in no state to be alarmed or annoyed.
Your visit now is most unwelcome.
Henry, I heard the carriage drive up.
I'll see that the baggage is put in.
Then we're leaving.
I think you know why I am here, Henry.
All the necessary preparations are made.
My part in the experiments is complete.
I have created, by my method, a perfect human brain - already living, but dormant.
Everything is now ready for you and me to begin our supreme collaboration.
No, no. Don't tell me of it.
I don't want to hear.
I've changed my mind. I won't do it.
I expected this.
I thought we might need another assistant.
Perhaps he can persuade you.
- Nothing can persuade me.
- We shall see.
- No! Not that!
- Oh, he's harmless, except when crossed.
Frankenstein.
Yes, there have been developments since he came to me.
Sit down.
- What do you want?
- You know.
- This is your work.
- Yes.
I'll have no hand in such a monstrous thing.
- Yes. Must.
- Get him out.
I won't even discuss it until he's gone.
Go now.
(Iow growl)
Go.
- Must do it.
- Nothing can make me go on with it.
(growls)
Now.
Put the bags in the carriage and I'll be out in a moment.
Go and tell the master to hurry,
Minnie, or we shall lose the train.
Excuse me for being so nervous, milady, but I don't like leaving you alone.
- Oh, nonsense, Minnie, I shall be all right.
- I hope so, milady.
Is that you, Henry?
(screams)
Henry! Henry, help!
(screams) Henry!
Milady!
(screaming)
- Elizabeth.
- (Minnie screams)
What is it? What's the matter?
Oh, sir, she's gone!
The monster, he's got her!
I saw it. The baroness is gone!
This is Pretorius' doing. Quick, search parties. There's not a moment to lose.
(crash)
I charge you, as you value your mistress' life, to do nothing and say nothing of this episode.
I assure you that the baroness will be safely returned, if you will leave everything to me.
Nothing, that is, except what he demands.
I can find no trace of Elizabeth.
Oh, I admit I'm beaten.
But if you can bring her back,
I'll do anything that you want.
Are you ready to complete with me this final experiment?
- What about Elizabeth?
- She is well, and will be safely returned if you will proceed.
- I'm ready.
- Ah.
Mind the steps.
They're a bit slimy, I expect.
I think it's a charming house.
It is interesting to think that once upon a time we should have been burnt at the stake as wizards for this experiment.
Doctor, I think the heart is beating.
Look. It's beating.
- But the rhythm of the beat is uneven.
- Increase the saline solution.
- Is there any life yet?
- No, not life itself yet.
This is only the simulacrum of life.
This action only responds when the current is applied.
We must be patient. The heart is more complex than any other part of the body.
Look. The beat is increasing.
Yes...
- It's stopped.
- Shall I increase the current?
This heart is useless.
I must have another.
And it must be sound and young.
Karl.
You must go to your friend at the accident hospital.
What we need is a female victim of sudden death. Can you do it?
If you promise me a thousand crowns.
It will be well worth it, and the baron will pay.
- Yes, yes. Go and get it.
- I'll try.
There are always accidental deaths occurring.
Always.
I'll get your heart.
I'll go into that room, I'll go into that room and I'll take my knife out.
I'll get her. I'll hold her down and there she'll be.
Where, I ask you? Where will she be?
A thousand crowns.
It's beating perfectly. Just as in life.
- Oh, if only I can keep it going until...
- It was a very fresh one.
(crash)
Where did you get it?
I gave the gendarme 50 crowns.
- What gendarme?
- It was a...
- police case.
- Yes, very sad.
Only, we can't bother about that now.
Can I do anything?
No, no, no! I can work better alone.
(growls)
- Work.
- Where's Elizabeth?
- Have you brought her?
- She wait. I wait.
I'm exhausted. I must get sleep.
Work. Finish. Then sleep.
But I can't work like this.
He must go away. Send him away.
I'll settle him for a little while.
Drink.
Drink.
Good.
(drops glass)
(Pretorius laughs)
That'll keep you quiet.
Elizabeth - she's dead.
Elizabeth is alive and she is well.
- I don't believe you.
- I have proof.
- Proof?
- In a few moments from now, she will speak to you from where she is through this electrical machine.
- Where is she?
- Not far from here.
(buzzing)
Speak, and she will hear you and answer.
Yes, yes, this is Henry.
Henry, yes, I'm safe. But, oh, Henry, how long? Come for me. I'm in...
Elizabeth? Elizabeth!
- She's gone.
- That is all now. But you heard her.
Yes, she's alive.
As soon as our work is completed she will be returned to you.
The heart is beating more regularly now.
Yes, it's been beating for nine hours.
Not yet, but soon...
- And the brain?
- Perfect and already in position.
- Then we are almost ready.
- Almost.
Shall we put the heart in now?
- Yes.
- Ludwig.
It's beating quite normally now.
Bring it over.
(thunder)
- The storm is rising.
- All right.
The air is heavy with electricity.
It's going to be a terrific storm.
We shall be ready.
Isn't it amazing, Henry, that lying here within this cowl is an artificially developed human brain?
Each cell, each convolution ready, waiting for life to come.
(thunder)
Look. The storm is coming up over the mountains.
- It will be here soon.
- The kites. Are the kites ready?
- Yes.
- Send them up as soon as the wind rises.
- Hurry, hurry!
- The kites, the kites, get 'em ready.
Ludwig!
He wants the kites!
Stand back.
Careful on the roof!
The big diffuser!
Wires! Slip down your wires!
All right. Stop your winches.
I'm coming up!
- Now, off with the kites!
- You take number two, Ludwig.
- Have you made your connections?
- Yes.
Stand by!
Let go of number one!
Let her go!
It's coming up!
- Go back. Go back down!
- (growls)
Go back!
No! Get away! Frankenstein!
Get away! Get away!
(wild screams)
Don't come near me!
Get away! Don't! No! No!
Don't! Don't!
(screams)
Raise the cosmic diffuser.
Remove the diffuser bands.
(Iow moan)
She's alive! Alive!
The bride of Frankenstein.
Friend?
(strangled sound)
Friend?
- Stand back. Stand back.
- (growls)
She hate me. Like others.
- Look out! The lever!
- Get away from that lever!
You'll blow us all to atoms.
Henry!
Open the door! Henry!
- Get back! Get back!
- I won't unless you come!
But I can't leave them! I can't!
Yes, go! You live!
Go!
You stay.
We belong dead.
(growls)
(hisses)
Darling, darling.
We didn't lie to you, folks.
We told you we had living, breathing monstrosities.
You laughed at them, shuddered at them... and yet, but for the accident of birth... you might be even as they are.
They did not ask to be brought into the world... but into the world they came.
Their code is a law unto themselves.
Offend one... and you offend them all.
And now, folks, if you'll just step this way... you are about to witness the most amazing... the most astounding living monstrosity... of all time.
Friends... she was once a beautiful woman.
A royal prince shot himself for love of her.
She was known as the peacock of the air.
She's the most beautiful big woman l have ever seen.
Why, Hans, how you talk. l should be jealous pretty soon.
-Don't be silly.
-Don't be silly? l've seen these women making eyes at my Hans.
Of course, l ain't jealous.
Frieda, my dear... l have eyes for only one woman... the woman l asked to be my wife.
Fräulein Frieda?
Are you laughing at me?
-Why, no, monsieur.
-Thanks. l'm glad.
-Why should l laugh at you?
-Most big people do.
They don't realize l'm a man with the same feelings they have.
Thank you.
You are so kind, monsieur.
-Nice.
-Don't.
You must come to see me sometime, and we'll have a little wine together.
Thank you, Fräulein Cleo.
You're getting old, Jean.
Probably, last night you had too heavy a dinner, and now your imagination is--
But, Monsieur Duval, at first l could not believe my own eyes.
A lot of horrible, twisted things, you know, crawling, whining, laughing--
Be done, Jean.
What were you drinking last night?
Nothing, monsieur, l assure you.
Monsieur, there must be a law in France to smother such things at birth...
-or lock them up.
-All right, Jean. lf there's anything like you say on my grounds, we'll have it removed.
-Come on, let's go.
-All of you! Tout de suite!
Go away, all of you!
Don't you know trespassing is the same as stealing? l'm sorry, monsieur. l am Madame Tetrallini.
These children are in my circus.
Children? They're monsters.
Your circus. l understand.
So you see, monsieur, when l get a chance... l like to take them into the sunshine... and let them play like...children.
That is what most of them are.
Children.
Please forget what was said, madame.
You are welcome to remain.
Au revoir. Come, Jean.
Thanks a thousand, monsieur.
A thousand thanks, monsieur.
Shame!
How many times have l told you not to be frightened?
Have l not told you...
God looks after all his children?
-Good evening, Madame Tetrallini.
-How are you, Madame Tetrallini?
Big crowd tonight.
There she goes, taking them out to exercise.
Nurse to a lot of mangy freaks.
" Just as they are represented on the banners...
" you will see them on the inside.
" Living, breathing monstrosities.
" Josephine Joseph, half-woman, half-man."
Have a cigar, Joseph.
You dropped your lipstick, Josephine.
Don't get her sore, or he'll bust you in the nose.
Come on. Hurry up. That's a boy.
You're all wrong. l didn't do it.
What are you trying to do, be funny?
You just don't understand.
A Roman lady....
Getting off the bull and scratching yourself.
Can't a Roman lady itch?
-Why don't you take a bath?
-l did, but it's the bull that needs the bath. l think she likes you... but he don't.
Those flowers you sent to me, they were beautiful.
But not much beautiful as you.
Thank you.
And Hans, l don't like to ask... but may l have the loan of another 1,000 francs... until my money from Paris arrives?
-With pleasure, Fräulein.
-Thank you. l'll bring it to your wagon tonight.
Forget it.
-Maybe l was just fooling.
-Fooling?
" Come, little girl, l want to take care of you."
And l fell for that.
Forget it.
So, you're quitting. ls that it?
Maybe l'm only fooling.
You are not quitting me!
Because l'm kicking you out!
No, you don't. l gave you this.
Why, you cheap....
Don't you come around crying tonight, trying to get back in. l'm through wasting my time and money... on things like you.
Yes. Your time, but my money.
Ungrateful little tramp.
That is fine.
What are you staring at?
Didn't you ever see a lady move before? l guess you've been listening to every word he said.
That's it.
Go ahead and laugh. lt's funny, ain't it?
Yeah. Women are funny, ain't they?
They're all tramps, ain't they?
Yeah. Except when you can get money from them. l'll be....
Who do you think you are, shooting off your head?
This is Phroso you're talking to.
Not any of those thugs you've been chasing around with.
-Now, you listen to me.
-l didn't mean you.
-l had to take it out on somebody.
-Yeah, you dames are all alike.
You're sharpshooting, you're cheap... and how you squeal when you get what's coming to you.
Easy, kid. Cut it! lt's my own fault.
What gets me so cockeyed sore at myself... is that l fell for that big hunk of beef.
So you finally got wise to yourself, did you?
The funny thing about you women is most of you don't get wise soon enough.
You wait until you're so old, nobody wants you.
Nobody does, most of the time.
You ought to be tickled to death you're washed-up with him.
You're not so hard to look at.
Give yourself a tumble.
You'll make the grade.
-Your breaks is coming.
-Coming? Gone, you mean.
Now you'll sit there feeling sorry for yourself.
No, l ain't.
Don't you ever accuse me of that.
All right.
But one thing, don't go out filling your hide with booze, celebrating...
'cause fun what's got that way never done no one no good.
Get me? l got you.
You're a pretty good kid.
You're darn right l am. You should have caught me before my operation.
-Hello, Phroso.
-Well, well, well.
-Tomorrow night's the big night, Daisy?
-Yes, the sister's getting married.
-And l'm thrilled to death.
-She thrills at anything.
-Roscoe's a good kid.
-She's only joking.
She'll like him lots after she knows him better.
That reminds me.
Close your eyes, Violet.
Go ahead, close them.
-What did l do?
-Pinched Daisy's arm.
What do you know about that?
Her master's voice is calling.
Getting fresh? l don't like it one....
Come on, you'll have to hurry.
We haven't much time.
So you were flirting with that cheap clown, were you?
-No, l wasn't.
-He was doing a trick with me.
You shut up. l'm marrying your sister, not you.
-l saw him getting familiar with you.
-Come on, Daisy.
No, you don't.
She's going to stay right here.
No, she isn't. l got to go.
You're always using that for an....
For an alibi.
Where are you going?
You don't look at others so much, do you?
Yes, l have seen you.
So that's how it is.
You got to be caught.
Well?
Come on in.
Help yourself to a drink.
That is fine.
Feel like eating something?
Always.
Prosit.
How many? l'm not very hungry. About six.
How do you like them?
Not bad.
But you are strong.
You are squeezing me to death.
And you'll like it.
You are taking my breath away.
You....
Now, here's something for your eye.
But, Hans, my Liebchen, you have not been listening... to a word l have been saying.
-Hans.
-Yes, Frieda?
-You have not been listening to me.
-Yes, l have, Frieda. l have.
Then what was l saying?
You were saying.... What were you saying? l was saying, tonight you must not smoke such a big cigar.
Your voice was very bad at tonight's show.
Please, Frieda, don't tell me what l do.
When l want a cigar, l smoke a cigar. l want no orders from a woman.
This is the first time since we have been engaged... you have spoken to me so.
Why is it?
Friedchen, l'm sorry. l....
-Here's our coffee.
-There it is.
-Five lumps of sugar in each.
-What? Five lumps?
The little ape sent to Paris for this?
Yes, Paris. We're doing very well.
But l don't like fruit.
You should eat a lot. lt's good for you.
Next time, l tell him l like champagne.
-Who is it?
-lt's Hans.
-Who?
-lt's Hans.
My darling, your basket of fruit was lovely.
But l am...taking a bath now.
-Can't you come back later?
-Yes, Fräulein.
Thank you, dear.
You'll spoil everything if he hears you.
What's the matter?
You ain't singing as usual.
This morning l have such a big washing to do.
How's Hans? l said, how's Hans?
Hans is fine. Danke, he's fine.
Frieda, something's wrong. What is it?
Nothing. Only....
That Cleopatra woman.... My Hans....
-l cannot tell it.
-She's still after Hans, ain't she?
Yeah. Always she's smiling by him.
Well, if she smiles by somebody l know... she'll have to buy herself a new set of teeth.
Why is it we women always has got to worry? lt's always been that way. l guess it always will be.
Yeah. And, by me, she has no shame.
Always, when l can hear it, she says to him:
" Many thanks, my darling, for the flowers.
" Thanks, my darling," for this... and " Thanks, my darling," for that.
Always something he has given her.
Don't you worry, Frieda.
He doesn't love her.
That big horse.
Yes, but she keeps after him.
That's why l worry.
Why not pink tights?
You know. With spangles all around. lt will show her figure off more.
Nein. No tights.
Without tights.
You know, that soft, flimsy, what-you-call-it stuff.
Where the figure shows through.
Why not like Lady Godiva?
Ja, that's it. And l'll hire her to ride the back of my bull.
Dummkopf! What have you on your shoulder for heads?
Swiss cheese?
-What's the matter, Cleo?
-l think l strained my shoulder last night.
Give a rub, will you?
Farther.
Down.
Over. lt's so good to be rubbed.
-Our cards, lady.
-What for?
A couple of rubbers from Berlin.
That reminds me. l had a swell dream about you last night.
-You did?
-Yeah.
You were standing in a bathing suit on a rock. You know, like a statue.
The wind was blowing through your hair, the waves were washing around you.
And your figure. How it stood out. lt looked great.
Say, you have got a good figure.
Do you think so?
-Sure.
-Phroso.
Did you try that gag l told you about?
Yeah, l did, and it was a wow.
Get up here, Johnny. l'll show it to you. l did what you told me, and it laid them right in the sawdust.
Watch this, Venus.
-Hello, Venus.
-Hello, Johnny.
Phroso, what else did you dream?
Then the dream changed. We was in Paris.
-Paris?
-Yeah, at the opera, right in the front box.
-We were all dressed up.
-What did l have on?
And did l look swell.
Everybody was pointing at me.
They were saying,
"That's Phroso, the clown."
And was l embarrassed.
-Did they say anything about me?
-Sure.
-What did they say?
-Hit me.
Go ahead. Hit me.
On the head. Hit me.
That's how it is. You don't think it's funny. lt's sad, is it? lt will just panic them, that's how sad it is.
No.
When? Come on!
Come on, Venus.
The bearded lady's baby's born!
-Ain't it cute? What is it?
-A girl.
Oh, boy, that's great.
And it's going to have a beard.
-How's the proud father?
-Fine.
-What was it?
-A girl.
Better luck next time.
You may get a couple of Smith Brothers. l'm trying.
Please, Violet, don't quarrel with him anymore. lf he's going to say anything, let him say it.
Don't let him " p-p-p" for an hour.
You're going to do as l say. l'm the boss of my home.
-Half of it, you mean.
-Please, Violet.
Listen here. l don't want those tramps you go with... hanging around my wife.
Be quiet. Hook up our dress. lf it isn't your dress l'm hooking up, it's something else.
And another thing. You got to cut out getting drunk every night, too.
-ls that so?
-Yeah. l'm not going to have my wife laying in bed half the day with your hangover.
Daisy, let's get out of here.
No, she don't.
She's going to stay right here.
Come on. l got to go.
You're always using that for an....
For an alibi.
Cleopatra ain't one of us.
Why, we're just filthy things to her.
She'd spit on Hans if he wasn't giving her presents.
Let her try it.
Let her try doing anything to one of us.
You're right.
She don't know us, but she'll find out.
There you are. l peeked out of the corner of my eye... and caught Madame Tetrallini giving us the once-over. l guess she knows she's got a good act.
One of the best in the business. lt isn't only our act that gets them.
We've got personality.
We know how to sell the stuff.
Same way in the last town.
Never heard such applause in your life.
Let me tell you something that everybody around here don't know.
We're only killing time with this circus.
We've got bigger time to follow, and we can do it, too.
Catch our act tomorrow night.
We got something new.
Yeah? Can you do anything with your eyebrow?
Schlitze, what a pretty dress.
How beautiful you look tonight.
You're just a man's woman.
You know what l mean? You. lf you're a good girl, when l get to Paris l'll buy you a big hat... with a long, beautiful feather on it.
-Hello, Elvira.
-Hi.
Hello, Jennie Lee. Look.
Hasn't Schlitze got a beautiful dress? lsn't that pretty?
When l get to Paris, l'm going to buy her a big hat with a long feather on it.
And if you're good girls, l'll buy you a hat with a bigger feather on it.
Why, Schlitze, what's the matter? l'm sorry, Schlitze.
Did you see him?
He was out there again tonight.
He followed you from the last town. l know it, and if Eddie sees it, there'll be a fight.
-lt ain't your fault.
-There you are, Frances.
-Thought you'd gone to bed.
-Hello, Rollo.
Hear that crowd out there again tonight? l bet you thought the tent was on fire.
Well, it wasn't.
Just the Rollo Brothers panicking them again.
But then, we do it in every town.
We're so used to it, it's getting monotonous.
You want to take a look at our act tomorrow night.
Careful. Don't waste any of it.
-Look how it sparkles.
-Like your eyes.
Dancing, gay, like bubbles. lt's delicious.
Nice. lt comes by the finest vineyards of France.
And you sent for it especially for me?
For the most beautiful woman in all the world.
Darling.
Hello there, baby.
Where have you been so long?
You're a funny guy, Phroso.
-Sometimes, you panic me.
-Don't l know it? l panic the world because l use my noodle. l think up funny gags. l make the world laugh.
With me, clowning is an art.
Why the hat? The head cold?
-Thought you and me had a date to go out.
-l forgot all about it.
Well, l'm into this now. l've got to go through with it.
Make it snappy, will you? l'm all dolled up for the occasion.
Sorry, kid. Can't do it now.
We'll make it some other time.
Don't feel that way about it. l just got this idea all of a sudden. l've got to finish it.
-Funny gag, isn't it?
-Yeah, l'm laughing myself sick.
Come on.
Honey, come on.
Now, now.
That's much better.
That's the first time you've ever done that.
-Ain't the first time l felt like doing it.
-Yeah? l don't mind telling you l've wanted to do this for a long time.
-We're all set now, Venus?
-Yeah.
-All set now.
-Yeah.
Please do.
Don't you want to make me happy?
-Yes, but l don't know what to say.
-Just say yes, dear.
Will you?
-Yes.
-Violet.
What are your kicking about?
You've got a good wife. You're happy. lt's that sister-in-law of mine.
She wants to sit up half the night, reading.
-That's tough.
-Tough? You....
-Good night, darling.
-Good night, Fräulein.
Cleo's gone on a diet.
-lt's awfully sweet of you to say that.
-And l know Violet will be happy.
Here's Roscoe.
-Hello.
-Roscoe, this is Mr. Rogers.
Glad to meet you.
-Violet and he are engaged to be married.
-Yeah?
Yes, and you must come to see us sometime.
Thanks.
You must come to visit....
Come to see us sometime, too. l certainly will. Thanks.
Who is it? lt's Frieda, Hans.
May l come in?
Yes, Frieda.
Now that l'm here, l don't know how to say it... how to make you understand. lf you knew how l feel, Hans... to come to you about her.
Frieda, l'm so sorry. l don't want to hurt you, but ich kann es nicht helfen. lf you could be happy, Hans... l would not care.
But l am happy, Frieda.
Never in my life was l so happy.
No, Hans. You think it only.
For you, she cannot bring happiness.
Frieda, you don't know.
But l do, Hans.
You think because she's so beautiful and l'm just--
Don't, Hans. Please.
To me, you're a man.
But to her, you're only something to laugh at.
The whole circus.
They make fun by you and her.
Let them laugh. The swine. l love her. They can't hurt me.
But they hurt me.
Frieda, l have been a coward. l should have come to you in the beginning.
Please forgive me.
Yes, Hans, l forgive you. lt is only that you should be happy l want.
You won't worry now, will you?
No, l won't worry.
Nice. Very nice. lt's platinum.
Say, where do you think that little polliwog is getting his money?
Listen at him. Getting so particular.
What do you care where the money comes from?
How much it's worth?
We got $500 for the bracelet, but this looks like thousands. l think next time l'll take a fur coat.
Say, that little ape's got ideas about you.
-Jealous?
-Me? l'd squish him like a bug.
That's his knock. l'll get rid of him. Go quickly.
Come in.
What do you want? lt's about Hans.
Well? l'm listening. lt's behind his back.
Everybody's laughing because he's in love with you.
Go on. l know you just make fun... but Hans, he does not know this. lf he finds out... never again will he be happy.
What makes you think that l am just making fun?
You're big. So beautiful--
And Hans is so little... so cute.
Well, maybe l'm going to marry him. lf you marry, it will be at you they laugh and stare.
That's good. Nothing like being different.
Cleopatra... queen of the air, married to a dwarp.
-A dwarf.
-A dwarp!
Then it's not for Hans you care.
-lt's the money.
-Money?
You little mind reader.
He has told you of the fortune he has inherited.
Always he swear to me... to tell no one until after we leave the circus.
A fortune?
And fancy you knowing about it, too.
Well, l can't be angry at him for that.
No. You cannot do this.
You wait and see.
Please. You can't.
A fortune. l bet the little ape's worth billions!
A fortune. Can you beat that?
A fortune. And l have him like that.
Shrewd little Hans.
He knew enough to keep his mouth shut. l could marry him.
Yes, he would marry me.
Midgets are not strong.
He could get sick.
How? lt could be done.
Done. l know it.
Come on, my little precious.
Come on, let's drink.
Big, happy drink. Come on.
Quiet! Please be quiet.
Hey, Koo Koo, give somebody else a chance.
All right!
All right, professor.
A waltz, please.
Show him up, volcano. Burn him up.
Our wedding night.
What a thrill.
Never before did l think l should be so lucky.
Lucky? l am the lucky one.
My little Hans.
My Cleo's happy.
-Happy.
-Happy? l am so happy. l even could kiss you, you big, homely brute.
My little green-eyed monster.
My husband is jealous.
He loves me.
Come, my little lover.
Drink to the happiness of your loving wife.
Attention!
We'll make her one of us.
A loving cup.
We accept her, one of us
We accept her
One of us
They're going to make you one of them.
My, big luck.
We accept her!
One of us!
They're going to make you one of them, my dear.
You dirty... slimy freaks!
Get out of here!
You! Out!
Get out! You heard her! Get out!
You filth!
Make me one of you, will you?
Well, what are you going to do?
What are you, a man or a baby?
Please. You make me ashamed.
Ashamed. You?
Holy jumping Christmas!
What must l do?
Must l play games with you?
Must mama take you horsy-back ride?
That's it. Horsy-back ride.
Come, my little flyspeck.
Mama is going to take you horsy-back ride.
-Come on.
-Giddyap.
Forget it, Hans.
She is sorry. l'm sorry.
Didn't l told you she was drunk?
Didn't l told you we was only having a little fun?
Please. l understand.
-Everything.
-No, you don't. l tell you, there's nothing between me and Cleo.
Be quiet.
Haven't you done enough damage for one night?
Don't you realize what l'm being accused of? l ain't going to be blamed for something l have not done. l don't blame you, Cleo. l don't blame Hercules.
Only me.
Myself.
Now you're talking.
-Talking like a man.
-You fool.
Always l should have known... you would only laugh at me.
My sweet, l'd rather fall from the trapeze and break my neck... than hurt your feelings.
Do you understand now? lt was only joke.
Our wedding... a joke?
Now l know how funny it is.
Hans the midget.
Hans...the fool!
Tell the divorce court. They'll laugh.
Everywhere, they're laughing.
-You give him too much.
-No, l haven't. l know what l am doing.
Come on, pick him up.
Doctor, what is it?
What caused it?
Poison.
A very bad case of ptomaine poisoning.
Doctor, did l do wrong, then?
Giving him mustard water?
No. Probably saved his life.
Never before did he drink like that... but she kept making him, and making him.
Drink?
You better get Cleo to tell the doctor what she put in that wine last night.
-What you're talking about?
-The stuff she put in the wine.
You're crazy.
You can't get away with it. l'll tell the coppers.
So, tell on your own people?
My people are decent circus folks.
Not dirty rats what would kill a freak to get his money.
You dirty little....
Your imagination's getting the best of you.
Yeah, maybe it is.
But coppers don't have imaginations, so l've been told.
Don't make me have to go to them.
-Cleo.
-Yes? lt has been a week tonight... since we have been married.
A week, since l have said...
-all those things to you.
-Don't!
Never can l forgive myself for what l've said. l've forgotten it.
Nothing matters except for you to be well.
So good you are by me, Cleo. l must fix your medicine, or l'll be late. l'll be soon back, my little.
Don't be lonely. l'll never forget what you are doing for me, Cleo.
But it's what l want to do, my darling.
Now l must hurry.
-Cleo.
-Yes?
Will you leave the door open, please?
Yes, my darling.
-Tonight.
-They will be ready.
All right. You come to my wagon.
" l must hurry now and fix your medicine, my darling...
" or l will be late."
" Dirty...
" slimy freaks."
-He's waiting.
-Fine.
Soon we go.
-You're imagining things.
-No.
Then l hear Hercules tell Cleo:
"Venus knows too much."
-Hercules? Venus?
-Yes.
Thanks, Frieda.
My little, you must go to sleep.
Your friends better go now.
-l like them here.
-No, Hans.
They can come back tomorrow. l will give you your medicine and get you off to sleep.
Go on, all of you. Quick.
-What's this?
-Give me that little black bottle.
Bottle.
You got this bottle of poison...to kill.
Phroso!
Get out, Venus!
Do l have to bust you in the jaw to make you get out?
Get out, Venus!
Help me!
Mrs. T!
Help! Please, help!
How she got that way will never be known.
Some say a jealous lover. Others... that it was the code of the freaks.
Others, the storm.
Believe it or not, there she is.
But, sir, they insist on seeing you. ln all these years, l've seen no one.
Have l not told you that?
-Send them away.
-Very good, sir.
-l can't see no one.
-Excuse me, sir. You can't come in.
-No, sir. l have my orders.
-Who's going to stop me? l'm in, ain't l?
Yes, you can, Hansie, old boy.
There's someone you've just got to see.
Why did you come here?
Please, Hans. Don't be angry.
Venus and Phroso have been so kind by me.
Please go away. l can see no one.
But, Hans, you tried to stop them. lt was only the poison you wanted. lt wasn't your fault.
Don't cry, Hans.
Come to me, my Liebchen.
Don't cry.
Don't, Hans.
Don't cry. l love you.
English
You've got to save my daughter's life.
But, my dear sir, we...
You see, judge Thatcher...
Jerry, if you love Jean, do something.
The root nerves at the base of the brain, something has impinged on them.
It's impossible knowing...
Stop telling me that!
Jerry.
= vollin.
Dr. vollin.
Can we get Dr. vollin?
- Dr. vollin?
- Dr. vollin?
= get Dr. vollin here.
Suddenly there came a tapping, as of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
Open then I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, in there stepped a stately raven.
The raven is my talisman.
= curious talisman.
Bird of the ill omen.
A symbol of death.
Death is my talisman, Mr. Chapman.
The one indestructible force.
The one certain thing in an uncertain universe.
Death.
Dr. vollin, the museum that I represent will pay you a very handsome price for your poe collection.
Yes, yes, I know, but will you tell Dr. vollin this is a matter of life and death?
Oh, if you'll hold the line just a moment, sir.
What is it?
Excuse me, Dr. vollin, Dr.
Halden is on the phone, sir.
I've told him you didn't wish to be disturbed, sir, but he says it's very urgent.
Yes, Dr. halden?
But.
You know that I've retired from actual practice and I'm doing only research.
Who is on the case?
Well, I'm satisfied.
They can handle it as well as 1.
- But Dr. vollin, I...
- Let me, Jerry.
Dr. vollin, this is judge Thatcher speaking.
It's my daughter.
She's, she's met with a serious accident, and none of the doctors in attendance can...
That's very flattering, but no.
No, judge Thatcher.
I'm sure they can handle it as well as 1.
I'm sorry.
He's hung up.
What's his home address?
- Hillview heights.
- Why?
I'm going there.
Mr. Chapman, I don't like to ask you to go, but I'm tired.
When you come again sometime,
I will show you those models I built.
They are down in my cellar.
= t should like to see them.
= next time.
Yes, I've actually built, you know, several of those torture and horror devices that poe described in his tales.
The pit and the pendulum.
That's the thriller, isn't it?
Well, I certainly look forward to seeing them.
Imagine building those things.
A very curious hobby.
It's more than a hobby.
Good night, Mr. Chapman.
Good night, doctor.
But you can't say no.
= t have said it.
I'll pay you any amount of money, Dr. vollin.
Money means nothing to me.
But someone is dying.
Your, your obligation as a member of the medical profession.
I respect no such obligation.
I'm a law unto myself.
But have you no human feeling?
My daughter is dying.
Death hasn't the same significance for me as it has for you.
But you're the one chance she's got.
Doctors cook and Hemingway are competent doctors.
Competent.
It seems that competence is not enough.
Cook and Hemingway and halden, they say that you're the only one.
So they do say I'm the only one.
Yes, I, I beg you for my daughter's life.
Very well, I will go.
Start the anesthetic.
You're not only a great surgeon, but a great musician, too.
Extraordinary man.
You're almost not a man.
Almost...
A god?
Yes.
A god with the taint of human emotions.
The scar is almost gone.
I'm so glad.
When I touch it, does it still hurt?
No.
A month ago, I didn't know you.
But now, I owe my life to you.
I wish there were something I could do.
= there is.
= tell me.
The restraint that we impose upon ourselves can drive us mad.
I don't know what you mean.
Jerry, Jerry halden tells me you've made him your assistant.
It means we can be married that much sooner.
Now, I owe you another debt.
You owe me nothing.
I did it to give him something, to take the place of what he's losing.
They're expecting me to dinner.
I, I think I'd better run along.
You're coming to see me dance tomorrow night?
Nothing can keep me away.
Thanks to you, I'm able to dance again.
I'm going to have a surprise for you.
Surprise?
Tomorrow night.
Goodbye.
Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered, weak and weary, over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore while I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, as of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
"Tis some visitor,” I muttered,
"tapping at my chamber door.
"Only this, and nothing more."
Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December and each separate dying Ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow, vainly I had tried to borrow from my books surcease of sorrow, sorrow for the lost lenore.
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore.
Did they really like me?
No, not much, they only called you back 12 times.
Oh, darling, isn't it wonderful?
I can dance again.
All our children will be dancers,
I can see them, the 14 dancing haldens.
That's what you think.
Here, dear, take my slippers off for me.
= of course.
Never so swell in my life.
Oh, Jean, you were darling.
We mean it, you were most charming.
Not only charming but dramatic as well.
Thank you so much.
That was marvelous, dear.
Dad.
What do you call that dance?
You've never done that before, have you?
I call it the spirit of poe.
So that was your surprise.
Was it a great surprise?
Whom the angels call lenore.
I told you never to come into this room unless I send for you.
I'm sorry, sir.
Judge Thatcher is here.
Judge Thatcher here.
Yes, sir.
- All right, send him in.
- Very good, sir.
Good afternoon, Dr. vollin.
Good afternoon.
Will you step in? - Thank you.
You were expecting my daughter.
You see, last night, while Jean was dancing,
I, I observed something that, that worried me.
Later on, in Jean's dressing room,
I, I felt the same thing.
Then I, I questioned Jean, and she made a confession.
She's in danger of becoming infatuated with you.
Of course, I can understand that.
You, you saved her life, Dr. vollin.
You think it's only gratitude she feels?
Oh, don't say it that way, Dr. vollin.
Don't cheat us of the right to be grateful to you.
Come to the point, Thatcher.
Well, I made it about as plain as I can without, er.
Look here, you, you know that Jean's engaged to young Jerry halden.
Now we can't let her get any ideas about you, can we?
You are saying, judge Thatcher, that Jean has fallen in love with me.
No, I'm not quite saying that.
That you do not approve.
You disapprove yourself, Dr. vollin.
You don't want a young girl like Jean falling in love with you.
Dr. vollin, I, I came to you once and asked you, when death was near, to save Jean.
I come to you again.
But this time, instead of from death, you want to save her from me.
= oh.
I never realized, vollin.
I'm sorry you feel like this.
Now that you know, you still say that your greatest wish is for her to marry halden?
More than ever.
There's no point in saving Jean's life if we're going to sacrifice her happiness.
You mustn't see her again.
You driveling fool.
Stop talking.
Be careful, vollin.
Not see her again?
Listen, Thatcher,
I'm a man who renders humanity a great service.
For that, my brain must be clear, my nerves steady, and my hands sure.
Jean torments me.
She has come into my life, into my brain.
Forget it, man, forget it.
Judge Thatcher, there are no two ways.
Send her to me.
Do you know what you're saying?
There are no two ways, send her to me.
You're mad. =I am mad.
And I tell you, the only way you can cure...
I can't talk to you, vollin.
I came here with a perfectly reasonable objection and expected you to be reasonable.
Instead I find you stark, staring mad.
Good day, Dr. vollin.
Send her, judge Thatcher.
I warn you.
Dr. vollin.
Home, hillview heights.
= t want to see Dr. vollin.
What do you want to see Dr. vollin about?
=-i am Dr. vollin.
I want to see you.
Come this way.
Come into my office.
Come.
You're Edmond Bateman.
Who told you?
Your picture in the papers.
That's no disguise.
That's why I'm here.
He said you could do, what was it he called it?
I want you should change my face.
But I'm not a plastic surgeon, Bateman.
He said you could do it.
That is unnecessary, Bateman.
Put it away.
I can do it, I can change your face.
= then do it.
It isn't plastic surgery, but there is a way.
Any way, it's all right with me.
First, you must do something for me.
Like what?
It's in your line.
Like what?
= torture and murder.
That's not my line.
My line is...
You shot your way out of San Quentin.
Two guards are dead.
In a bank in Arizona, a man's face was mutilated, burned, a cashier of the bank.
Well, he tried to get me into trouble.
I told him to keep his mouth shut.
He gets the gag out of his mouth and starts yellin' for the police.
I had the acetylene torch in my hand.
So, you put the burning torch into his face.
Into his eyes.
Well, sometimes you can't help things like that.
This job I want done is in your line, Bateman.
Accept my word for it.
I want you to do this for me.
Then, I change your face.
I got money, I'll pay for it.
No money.
I don't want to get into no more trouble.
And they're after me now.
=I can take care of that.
You can stay here after the job is done.
I'll tell you something, doc.
Ever since I was born, everybody looks at me and says, you're ugly.
Makes me feel mean.
Why are you telling me this?
I am not interested in your life story.
I'm saying, doc, maybe because I look ugly.
Maybe if a man looks ugly, he does ugly things.
You are saying something profound.
A man with a face so hideously ugly.
Don't ask me to do this job for you, doc.
I don't want to do them things no more.
Fix me so I look good, will you?
Then maybe I could...
All right, Bateman.
You'll do it, doc, you'll change me?
- Yes.
- When?
Now.
What's that?
You don't need that.
Give it to me.
No, you don't.
I'll keep this.
I'm taking you where if police or anyone should come, they can't find you.
Oh, oh, I see what you mean.
It is to protect you, Bateman, come.
You go first.
Of course, I show you the way.
The operation is very simple.
In 10 minutes, it's done.
= is that all it takes?
The nerves, the nerve ends, Bateman, the seventh cranial nerve, which has its root here, from this come the nerves that control the muscles of the face.
If something happens to these nerve ends, it alters your expression.
In other words,
I, who know what to do with these nerve ends, can make you look anyway I choose.
Now, loosen your collar, lie down.
I will not need you until Monday.
Thank you, sir.
Have a pleasant holiday.
Thank you, sir.
Ah, you're doing fine, Bateman.
I will take a look.
= it's hard to talk.
That's to be expected.
It will disappear.
Do, do I look different?
Yes.
Something's the matter.
My eye.
That will pass, Bateman.
My mouth.
I want to see myself.
All right.
Just wait here.
= no!
Bateman.
Are you ready to do it for me, Bateman?
Fix my mouth.
You're monstrously ugly.
Monstrous ugliness breeds monstrous hate, good.
I can use your hate.
You will do this for me, Bateman.
Fix my mouth.
I'll fix your mouth, Bateman.
Do it, change me.
I'll change you, Bateman.
You will look good.
The way you wish.
Make me look good.
First you must do this job for me, Bateman.
I can't use my hand to do it.
Your hand is used to torture.
Your hand must do it.
My brain, your hand.
Speak up, Bateman.
Do you wish to remain the ugly monster that you are?
No, no.
Then you will do this job for me, will you?
You must speak now, yes or no?
Yes.
Good.
Wait.
Put on these clothes, and report to me for further instructions.
Be quick about it.
In an hour, my guests will arrive.
I wonder if dad will be very angry.
Why should he?
He distinctly said no when we got the invitation.
- Why?
- Well...
Don't go into that again.
We've been all over that before.
Well, I do agree with him that Dr. vollin is a little mad.
Well, aren't we all?
What of it?
You know, uh, you're taking quite a chance persuading me to go.
How?
= he kind of likes me.
Yeah, I'll bet.
All right, what will you bet?
I'll bet you.
All right, place your bets.
They're off!
Please notify my horse the race has started.
Oh, isn't it exciting, pinky?
Yes, quite.
I like my horse, he has such a kind face.
The quarter.
Come on, number five!
Number three, number three!
Come on, number five!
Number three, number three, number three!
Doesn't my horse look like your father, pinky?
I hadn't noticed the resemblance, my love.
Come on, azucar!
Lady's man.
They're on the home stretch.
I will not let myself get excited.
- Oh!
- Oh, there they are!
Oh, has mine come, I'm afraid to look.
Who's winning?
= number five wins.
= that's me!
I'm the winner.
Wasn't mine the brown horse, pinky?
No, no, yours was the white, my love.
= oh.
I've been rooting for the wrong horse.
Oh, Jerry, you idiot, what're you doing?
I'll be a mess, you fool, stop it.
Next race, place your bets.
Now, I'll have to go upstairs and fix my hair.
I'm a sight, I know.
Well, don't forget you owe me two bits.
You know, I like horses,
I, I grew up with them.
Yes, I can see that when I look at you.
Does anyone want any more horse races?
Not me.
It's too exhausting a game for me.
Let's go and get a drink.
Feel this, my pet.
Just what am I supposed to feel?
My pulse, it's beating.
I'm going to ask Dr. vollin's advice.
Doctor? - Yes, colonel.
I get the most peculiar sensations, uh, pains you might call them.
Not exactly pains, but they come and they go.
What would you say they were?
You eat too much, colonel.
I'm asking Dr. vollin, my pet.
You're always trying to get free advice.
Now, now, my pet.
You know, the other evening we met Dr. thayor, and he turned out to be a veterinary.
My pet, he gave me some very good advice about my dogs.
Oh!
Man to see you.
Excuse me.
Oh, please, don't stand there.
Yes, move away, my man, like a good fellow.
Never stand behind people.
Most unfortunate looking fellow.
I'm so glad you have come, judge Thatcher.
Dr. vollin, is my daughter here?
Judge Thatcher, I'm genuinely sorry for all the stupid things
I said to you the other day.
I want you, please, to forget.
One can't forget a man saying...
But I was under a terrible strain, and if you can feel in anyway indebted to me, clear your debts by forgiving me for what I said.
Well, I suppose a man can...
Oh, I, you do forgive me.
Now let's go and join the others.
Go upstairs and tell miss
Thatcher her father is here.
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
Hello, judge, I was wondering whether you'd arrived.
That's from upstairs.
Oh, dad, I'm so glad you're here.
What happened?
What's the matter?
I just had a terrible fright.
What was it?
I was standing in my room looking in the mirror when the door opened and an awful looking man came in.
Oh, you mean, my servant, the poor fellow.
Come on, let's sit down.
I will tell you about him.
Come.
I'm sorry, miss Thatcher, that my servant scared you.
Please be seated.
All of you, please.
Poor fellow.
He can't help the way he looks.
He served in my regiment.
Arab bandits took him a prisoner.
They mutilated him and tortured him.
They have a genius for devising torture.
It's almost the equal of Edgar Allan poe.
= Dr. vollin is keen about poe.
Yes, I've noticed.
Why your extraordinary interest in poe, Dr. vollin?
That poem of poe's, the raven.
I say, what is the raven?
It's a bird, pinky.
A pretty thing to have around the house.
But isn't the raven the symbol of death?
It always has been.
What is your interpretation of the raven?
I will tell you.
Poe was a great genius.
Like all great geniuses, there was in him the insistent will to do something big, great, constructive in the world.
He had the brain to do it.
But he fell in love.
Her name was lenore.
Longing for the lost lenore.
Longing for the lost lenore.
Something happened.
Someone took her away from him.
When a man of genius is denied of his great love, he goes mad.
His brain, instead of being clear to do his work, is tortured, so he begins to think of torture.
Torture for those who have tortured him.
My interest in poe, the way I speak about torture and death, you people, being laymen, perhaps do not understand.
As a doctor, a surgeon, I look on these things differently.
A doctor is fascinated by death and pain.
How much pain a man can endure.
But I disagree with you, Dr. vollin.
That's not why I'm a doctor.
You're a doctor because you want to do good.
Yes.
Please let's change the subject.
Let's go to bed.
Why, colonel, where are your company manners?
I'm sleepy, my pet.
I'm sleepy, too, pinky.
Let's all go to our nice warm beds on this cold, windy night.
Well, if it isn't rude to our host.
On the contrary.
I am flattered that you act as if you were at home.
Thank you.
Thank you, doctor.
I'm so sorry.
Sorry?
You came into the room so suddenly.
Please believe I wouldn't have been frightened otherwise.
Oh, Jean?
Coming.
Jean!
Come on, darling.
This is your room, judge Thatcher.
Thank you.
Dr. vollin, may I see you for just a minute?
I would like to know about the drafts in this house.
You know, I'm very sensitive about drafts.
I'm certain you'll be comfortable.
- Thank you.
- Please.
Allow me.
After you, sir.
This man, vollin is stark, staring mad.
Why, dad.
Now, you came here against my wishes.
All right, it's done.
But now let's get our things together and go home.
- What?
- Let's go home.
But why?
= well, in the talk I had with him the other day, he said some things that absolutely convinced me that he's not in his right mind.
And just now, the way he talked about poe and, and torture.
Oh, talk, that's all it was.
He was being amusing.
Well, I'm afraid there's something wrong with my sense of humor.
I tell you, it's dangerous to be under this man's roof.
Oh, dad, he's not going to cut our throats while we're asleep.
Well, I think it's entirely possible.
Grown-up people.
When a perfectly reputable and distinguished surgeon talks about poe, why get scared?
There's absolutely nothing to be afraid of.
= come in.
Get out of here.
Judge Thatcher.
Bateman!
What are you doing here?
Go downstairs.
You mustn't be frightened.
The poor fellow means nothing.
Probably came up to see if there's anything he could do for you.
Are you comfortable?
Quite, thank you.
Yes, thank you, Dr. vollin,
I'm sure we shall be very comfortable.
Good, then I leave you now.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Goodnight.
You're worried about Jean, aren't you?
Yes, I am.
You're afraid that in the middle of the night, he might.
Don't you think it would be a good idea if I changed rooms with her?
And what about you?
Well, he certainly isn't coming into my room.
Well, let me do that then.
Come on, I'll go change rooms with Jerry.
All right.
Will you take my bags, dear, please?
All right.
Come along, Bateman.
The most unique museum of torture.
Rare old pieces, all of them.
But I warn you, ready for use.
This device is from one of poe's stories.
The pit and the pendulum.
A man was thrown into a pit and tied to a slab like this.
Suddenly, he hears some peculiar noise coming from above his head.
He looks up, sees a knife flashing, swinging rhythmically, as it gradually descends.
These things here are manacles, which are controlled by that lever.
Clasped around the wrists and ankles, they hold a man on the slab.
Helpless, he cannot move.
In 15 minutes, the knife reaches the heart.
Got you.
Come on, Bateman, release me.
Release me, Bateman.
And please try to remember, should anything happen to me, you remain the hideous monster that you are.
Come on, Bateman.
It's all quite simple, isn't it, Bateman?
Jerry, oh, I'm afraid!
What, what's the matter, what's happened?
Look in my room.
All right, come on then, if you're afraid.
Darling, that's nothing.
The wind's blown a tree down, it's fallen against your window, that's all.
Here, put your robe on or you'll get cold.
Jerry, I saw a man coming up through the floor.
Darling, I can understand you imagining all sorts of things, but not a man coming up through the floor.
I'm not imagining it.
I'll tell you what you do.
You sleep in your own room, come on.
Now you hop right into bed.
You've got to get some sleep, you know.
I guess daddy was right after all.
We probably should have gone home.
Don't be silly.
There.
You all right now?
Yes, dear.
Not frightened anymore?
= mm=-mm.
Good night, my sweet.
Good night, darling.
What do you mean sneaking up through the trap door?
Don't compel me to treat you like an animal.
You were looking for the girl, weren't you?
Answer me.
Yes.
The girl does not concern you.
Why did you try to go to her?
Answer me, why?
Who is that?
= it's the colonel.
My wife wants a sleeping powder, Dr. vollin.
She woke me out of a sound sleep and told me to go down and get a sleeping powder.
You know, there-there's nothing worse than being wakened from that first sweet sleep.
I doubt if I shall fall asleep again.
Certainly, just wait a moment here.
Oh, pardon me.
I, I'm so sleepy.
Here are two powders.
Two?
One for you.
For me?
Huh, Dr. vollin, I don't know how to thank you.
Such a nice man, so thoughtful.
= it's now 11:00.
The job begins.
Oh!
Let me go!
Let me go, help!
Help me, help me!
Let me go, help, help!
Let me go, help, help, Jerry!
Help me, help me!
Jerry!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Greetings, judge Thatcher.
What's the meaning of this, vollin?
My servant is a little uncivilized, so I ask your forgiveness.
Now, I see you can hardly stand on your feet.
Bateman, see that judge
Thatcher lies down.
Make him comfortable, Bateman.
What's that thing?
= a knife.
What's it doing?
Descending.
What are you trying to do to me?
Torture you.
Oh, try to be sane, vollin.
= I'm the sanest man who ever lived.
But I will not be tortured.
I tear torture out of myself by torturing you.
15 minutes.
There's the clock, you can see it.
Torture waiting, waiting.
Death will be sweet, judge Thatcher.
= no!
Daddy, help!
Jerry!
Jerry!
= do not be alarmed.
I've a pleasant surprise for you.
Jerry, Jerry!
Help me, Jerry!
- Jean!
- Jerry, Jerry!
Jerry, Jerry!
Geoffrey, Geoffrey!
Wake up, Geoffrey!
They've got Jean!
I say!
What is it, old boy?
They've got Jean, wake Grant.
Jerry!
I couldn't wake either the colonel or Mrs. Grant.
They seem to have been drugged.
Where's judge Thatcher and Jean, old boy?
They took Thatcher through this panel.
They must have Jean, too, I can't open it.
Here, let me help you, old chap.
I've looked everywhere.
I'll call the police.
Hello, hello, operator, operator.
The line's dead.
- What's that?
- What's what?
Look!
Oh, pinky!
= it's a steel shutter.
There is now no way of getting in, no way of getting out.
Help me, Jerry!
Jerry, please!
Jerry, please!
We can't hear the wind anymore.
= it's as if we were all in a tomb.
We've got to get through that panel.
Do you mind if I smoke?
Jerry, Jerry!
Help me, Jerry!
Jerry!
Please, stop, Jerry!
Bateman, tell her to stop.
Oh Jerry, help me!
Help me!
What're you going to do to Jean?
Oh, I have the most delightful plan for her.
Help me, Jerry, Jerry!
He said stop.
Yes, I'm ugly.
He did it.
Dr. vollin? = yes.
Oh, he's mad.
What will he do to me?
He won't hurt you.
Will you help me?
You will help me, won't you?
You'll help me get out of here?
No, no!
Vollin is going, fix my face.
I tell you he's mad.
He won't help you, I'll help you.
Bateman.
Please get me out of here.
I swear, I'll help you.
Bateman!
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!
I'm going through.
That's what they want you to do.
It's a trap!
Going through all the same.
We've got to follow him.
Oh, oh pinky!
You know what to do, Bateman.
Dad, Jerry!
Please come, Jerry!
You!
Jerry, oh, Jerry!
= it's Jean!
The switch, to open this lock.
=- it's locked.
The servant must have the key.
Jean, Jean, Jean!
Stop Jerry, he'll kill you!
Bateman, bring him here.
Jerry.
You are just in time to be witnesses to a wedding ceremony.
Now the ceremony begins.
Too bad, judge Thatcher cannot be with us.
But if we speak loudly enough, perhaps he can hear us.
At any rate, we can hear.
At least let my father go.
We will dismiss the question of your father.
Consider it well disposed off.
See here, vollin, things like this can't be done.
It's no use, Geoffrey.
Look at his eyes.
I'll soon be rid of my torture, rid of it!
And I'll be the sanest man who ever lived.
Now, I have a pleasant surprise.
Bateman.
Do as I order, Bateman, the switch!
My gift to you two.
The place in which you will live.
A humble place, but your love will make it beautiful.
All right, go in.
Go in.
You will live in this place forever and ever.
It will be the perfect marriage.
The perfect love.
You will never be separated.
Never, Bateman!
Bateman!
Come on, Bateman, close it!
Forever and ever.
What a torture.
What a delicious torture, Bateman.
Greater than poe.
Poe only conceived it,
I have done it, Bateman.
Poe, you're avenged!
What happens in that room?
Another one of poe's devices, Bateman.
It's the room where the walls come together.
Darling.
There's nothing we can do.
It doesn't take long, Bateman, until they're crushed, dead.
That girl, dead?
Why not?
You've killed in your time.
You monster, you like to torture.
Yes, I like to torture.
You've done nobly, Bateman.
Now, I'll do nobly by you.
You, you'll fix me?
Yes.
She crushed to death?
Yes.
No, no!
What are you doing?
First, I let her go.
If you touch that switch, Bateman.
I'll not fix you.
No.
You'll stay the way you are, Bateman.
= no!
If you touch that.
Stop!
Bateman!
Bateman!
I'll get the key.
You go to Thatcher.
Come on, Geoffrey!
I've got the key.
Get that thing out of the way.
Gotcha. = oh.
- Come out.
- Oh!
Daddy!
It's all right.
It's all right, don't worry.
No, it's all my fault.
No, it's not your fault, dear.
Don't blame yourself.
I'm so sorry.
We're all safe now.
What is it, my pet?
= the colonel.
We've forgotten the colonel and his wife.
Poor Bateman.
He gave up his life.
Yes, darling, he saved us from being crushed, all right.
Yes.
I think I'd better finish the job, don't you?
Only a little more gently.
So you're the big, bad raven, huh?
THE GHOST GOES WEST
Based on a novel by Eric Keown
CAST
18th Century Scotland
- What are we waiting for? - We're not to be denied by the Glouries!
If they refuse to open, we'll break down the door!
Wist, lads!
I tell you again, we will see the accursed Glourie.
And if you don't open the door, we'll break it down.
Aye? Aye? But you daren't disturb the Glourie!
Here, your medicine, Glourie.
The physician said...
Never mind what the physician said!
My medicine has always been whisky.
But I tell youGlourie, he said that it would kill you!
I will not die.
I will not die until I seen my son go to the war!
- What was that?
- The MacLaggan!
Here's the Glourie!
And what business have men of clan MacLaggan with me this day?
Give me my bonnet.
Gavin Glourie, we come to tell you that me and my five sons and all the men of clan MacLaggan, are marching to fight the English for the glory of Scotland. and we rejoice that in the battle there will not be one fighting man that bears the hated name of Glourie.
I am too old and too ill to fight this day, but if, by accident, any of you MacLaggan should happen to stray near the front line of battle, you will see there my son Murdoch!
Your son Murdoch, eh?
Ay!
We saw him just now in a field playing with women. Young women!
A better occupation for a Glourie than war!
Fetch me my son!
He will repay you for this insult!
He'll have his chance on the battlefield, but let me tell you, for the last time, that the Glourie are a clan of craven cowards, and we MacLaggans, being men, despise you!
Men? I tell you, one Glourie is man enough to thrash
50 MacLaggans!
- That's an insult, Father!
We'll revenge it! - No!
It's a waste of strength to bicker with the last poor feeble relics of the clan Glourie!
- Come on, lads.
- Get out, before my son comes and slays you all!
Give me that...
Bring me another glass.
- Whose turn is it now?
- Mine!
- Later.
- Mine! - No!
- Mine.
- No, no, it's Jean's.
What's the difference betwixt a thistle in the heather and a kiss in the dark?
If you can't tell me by the time
I've spelt "Killiecrankie", you must pay the forfeit.
K-I-L-L-I-E...
- I give it up.
- Wait now, C-R-A-N-K-I-E.
Well, you pay the forfeit.
- What is it?
- You know very well it's a kiss, it's always a kiss, come here.
- Murdoch!
- What is it?
Forgive me, but your father is wanting you.
What for?
I think he's wanting you to be going to the battle.
Oh, aye, the battle.
But first I must claim the forfeit!
Murdoch!
Fare thee well, lasses!
I'll be back soon!
Murdoch!
When you meet any of the clan
MacLaggan on the battlefield, strike him down!
But I thought I was supposed to fight the English?
You're a Glourie.
You fight the MacLaggans first!
You can attend to the English later.
- Goodbye, my son.
- Goodbye, Father.
Remember! You must not pause for one moment until you've avenged that insult!
- Now Glourie, you must rest.
- I'll rest...
My son's a man at last!
I can die content.
...When I finish this whisky.
Glourie, Glourie!
- What's happened?
- He's ill.
- Aye, very ill.
- But we'll send for the physician!
No, it's too late now.
May Heaven receive the soul of Gavin Glourie.
Good morning, my bonny lass!
- Remember Murdoch, your father said you mustn't pause.. - Be quiet.
Tell me lassie, which is the way to the battle?
The second turning to your left, and then bear right until you come to men fighting. And that'll be it.
Well if the battle doesn't start on time, I'll be back. Wait for me.
That cannon looks as though it's seen great service!
Hey, it's been fighting for
Scotland for over a hundred years.
But how many cannons have the English?
A dozen or more, but they're all brand new.
No match for Old Terrible here.
Wait till you hear him!
I'll be glad to, but first
I've an account to settle with the accursed MacLaggans!
But what do you want with them?
They've insulted the name of
Glourie, which I'm proud to bear.
- Are you one of the MacLaggan?
- Me? No, no, I hate them too!
- Have you aimed Old Terrible?
- Ay, sir!
He's all ready to blow the English off the face of the earth!
- Then fire!
- Come, alack!
Come back! Alack!
Come on! Fire!
I think you've made a slight mistake in your aim.
You addle-pated fools!
You've wasted a good cannonball!
Never mind! I saw where it fell.
I'll bring it back to you.
Come on, lads.
The battle's started!
Forward till we meet the Redcoats, and then we'll chase them out of Scotland!
Forward!
- MacLaggan? - Don't interrupt us, we're advancing.
But Murdoch Glourie is looking for you.
A Glourie?
Here on the battlefield?
Where is he?
- At the cannon.
- You lads go and find him!
- But the battle!
First we must settle this important matter!
About turn!
March!
It must have rolled in there.
I'll leap over.
Here, hold my claymore and tarts.
Why my dear young lady, what's the matter?
This horrible battle.
Oh, it can't be as bad as all that.
My lover is there fighting and he'll be killed.
You mustn't think of him.
He's a hero.
We're all heroes.
There, there...
You're a kind good man and
I thank you for comforting me.
It's a pleasure, my dear.
Tell me, do you know the game of Spell Me a Riddle?
You see I tell you a riddle, and if you can't tell me the answer by...
Murdoch!
Remember, your father said that you mustn't pause.
Away with you!
I'll be out in a moment.
- There's the Glourie!
- That's his groom.
- He'll know where Murdoch is.
- Let's ask him.
- I give up.
- Well you must pay the forfeit.
- What is it?
- It's this.
Murdoch!
There's always some cursed interruption!
Oh, I see! Forgive me lassie,
I'll be back soon!
- Murdoch!
- Here, stop!
- There he is!
- Look at him!
- Bold Glourie, the fighting man!
- With a woman, as usual!
- My cannon will stop your laughing!
- Come and get it yourself.
We'll return it, through your body!
- Hand it over!
- You've met your match, Glourie!
- Come on!
- Get that cannon, Glourie!
We'll get it!
Just a minute, just a minute!
I have to have a sword!
Will someone lend me a sword?
GUN POWDER
Shoot!
May Heaven receive the soul of Murdoch Glourie.
Murdoch, my son, can you hear me?
Father, where are you?
Where am I?
In limbo,
the empty place between
Heaven and Hell.
I died with honor, and you died a coward's death.
Do you realize that?
Yes Father, I suppose I did.
Then you can never be welcomed among your ancestors in Heaven.
Never?
You will be an earth-bound ghost,
doomed to haunt the dark halls of Glourie Castle...
The Lord preserve us!
It's a ghost!
It's come back!
It's the ghost!
It's the ghost!
Father?
Yes, my son?
How long do I have to go on with this nonsense?
I mean, frightening people like that.
You promised to avenge our honor and you failed.
You will remain the phantom in this castle
until that promise is fulfilled.
When you twist the nose of one of our enemies,
and make him kneel before you, and admit that one Glourie
can thrash 50 MacLaggans.
But suppose I can never find a MacLaggan?
A promise is a promise.
Every night at midnight,
you will awaken and walk through the halls of this castle,
until you've found a MacLaggan
and forced him to bow down before you in humble apology.
Then and not till then,
will you be permitted to ascend from limbo
and join your noble ancestors in Heaven.
Farewell,
Miserable ghost of a Glourie.
20th Century
FOR SALE
GLOURIE CASTLE
INQUIRE WITHIN
- Hey!
- What?
Excuse me, but I'm looking for the owner of this place.
Aye. So am I.
He's hiding somewhere around this castle, and I propose to find him!
Well you'll not find him here, so I would thank you to take your sour faces out of my kitchen!
Donald Glourie owes me about 150 pounds for ales, wines and liquors furnished during the past seven years.
And he owes me upwards of
200 pounds for provisions.
And what about my loan?
Aye, aye. We know how much he owes you skinflints, and you know how much chance you have of being paid before the day this castle's sold.
- And when will that day come?
- I just could not say.
I will not wait for it.
We'll get the bailiff and take possession ourselves.
Possess away then, but get out of my sight, the lot of you!
What's more, there's someone else in the house after him!
- Who? - I don't know.
- Where?
- In the hall.
- Oh, I...well...
They'll not be there long!
How did you come here?
I just walked in that front door.
It was open.
That's no reason. The lock of that door's been broken for 200 years.
What do you want?
I saw a sign that this place was for sale.
That's still no reason.
You know the price?
You'll not be thinking of buying it, are you?
Master Donald!
- Master Donald!
- What is it?
It might be a purchaser.
- Do you think he's serious?
- It's a she, and young too.
But she's got a queer kind of speech.
I'll try to understand her.
The debts of Donald Glourie come to a grand total of 2374 pounds, 18 shillings and 4 pence half pence.
And he hasn't even the half pence to pay us!
Do you think he'll ever sell this old ruin?
Not while the Glourie ghost walks these halls.
'Tis the curse that's been on his family for 10 generations!
Ghosts or no ghosts, debts are debts and must be paid.
Come on, we'll search the castle till we find the renegade.
And when you find him, don't let him out of your sight!
This is Mr. Glourie, Miss.
How do you do?
My name is Peggy Martin.
- Oh...mine's Donald.
I hear you're interested in selling this castle.
Why yes, I might be interested.
Will you sit down?
No, I think I'll just stand.
I'd like to walk around a bit.
I'm kind of nervous.
That's funny, so am I.
Oh, that's too bad.
It doesn't really matter.
I break something every day just for the pleasure of putting it together again.
Are you an American?
- Yes, how'd you guess it?
Why do you keep staring at me like that?
Have you never seen an American before?
Oh yes, several.
Where, in the zoo?
Please forgive me, it's just that...well...
We don't often get anything worth staring at in this...
Mr. Glourie, there is a financial matter to discuss.
Oh yes, of course. Do sit down.
I'm not at all sure I do want to sell this castle, but I'll be glad to show you around.
Of course, some of the panelling's falling to pieces because it needs to be repaired.
I love it!
You've no idea what it means to us to see something that isn't new.
Here is the room that
Mary, Queen of Scots slept in.
Hey!
He's in that room!
How do you do?
It probably sounds silly to you, but I guess every American has a hankering for this kind of... romance, beauty, and peacefulness.
Who are all those cheerful-looking men?
Oh them.
They're just businessmen.
Do they want to buy the castle?
Yes, they're very keen to get possession of it.
- I think it's lovely.
- Yes, lovely.
I'm sure you'd hate to part with it.
I'd hate to let any of them have it.
We haven't said anything about the price!
Oh no, there's no need to mention that.
I'll leave that to my father.
Would it be all right if
I brought him here?
And my mother too?
- Of course.
But perhaps they'd...
Perhaps you'd bring them for dinner here this evening.
Have you any other relatives?
- No.
I mean no husbands or anything like that?
Not even one.
What time shall we be here?
- As early as possible. I mean...
And if for any reason your parents can't come, come anyway, won't you?
Oh don't worry,
I'll have them here.
Goodbye, Mr. Glourie!
- Goodbye, Miss...Miss...!
And who's to furnish this fine dinner?
And the champagne?
And who's to serve it?
You'll furnish the meat, Mr. Ross.
I think we'll have grouse.
And the champagne from you,
Mr. MacKaye, and Mr. Crawford we'll have some of your best salmon.
And all of you will help to serve it!
- What?
- The insolence of a woman!
We'll see you in jail first, and him too.
Come into the kitchen and we'll all have a glass of whisky and talk it over.
We will not!
We're self-respecting tradesmen and we'll not.
You had the talk just now, didn't you?
Aye, we did, but...
"Aye, but"!
The lass is an American, and all
Americans are filthy with money.
- Is that not so? - I've heard of some that used to be.
That whisky was furnished by me and I'm still owed for it.
Come, come now, Mr. MacKaye.
Even if it isn't paid for, it's still whisky.
I know Master Donald owes you all, especially you, Mr. Ross, you flint-hearted moneylender, but the only chance you have of being paid is for him to sell the castle to these Americans.
What about the Glourie Ghost?
At midnight he'll be appearing.
And there'll be no sale.
- They'll see no ghost.
We'll give them a good dinner and long before midnight they'll have agreed to buy the castle and we'll be rid of them.
Maybe.
Come on my lads, we must give this matter some thought.
Good gracious! Have you not finished that yet?
It'll never be ready tonight!
Will you stop that hideous noise while I'm cooking?
We're needing practice.
Well off you go to the piggery.
It'll sound more natural there.
What are you waiting for?
I must say you look a rich man in your fine clothes.
Thank you, Fergus.
I can assure you that the tailor who made this dinner jacket also hopes the castle will be sold.
Don't forget that you borrowed that shirt stud from me.
It's an heirloom in my family, and everyone admits it's solid gold.
It must be returned.
It will be returned, in good condition.
- Is everything ready?
- Everything but your guests.
They're late.
And I warn you,
I'll not be here at midnight to see the horrible specter that frightened my grandmother out of her wits!
I'll keep my eye on that clock.
You know I'm in the retail grocery business, chain stores all over the United States.
Over 20 millon customers!
Quite a responsibility knowing that every day you have
20 millon stomachs to fill.
- Oh, yes!
- He's drunk the whole bottle.
- Open another.
- Remember it's 22 and 6 a bottle!
And remember also that's my stud!
This place seems very antique.
It's 600 years old, Mother.
I knew I could feel a sense of the past here.
Is it by any chance haunted?
Mother's scared to death of ghosts, but I'm not, I'd love to meet one.
Well I've no desire for dealings with the other world.
Is there a ghost, Mr. Glourie?
Well, I suppose there are legends about every old place.
I'll answer your question, Gladys.
There isn't any ghost here or anywhere else because ghosts simply don't exist outside of mystery stories.
If you don't mind, I'll have some more of that duck.
- Duck? That's grouse.
- What's the difference?
11 shillings and 8 pence.
Thank you.
Ever since I had my nervous breakdown,
I have been extremely psychic.
And if there were a ghost here,
I should see him and hear him.
What's that?
What is it?
It's only the bagpipes Mr. Martin, an old Scottish custom during dinner.
An old Scots custom, eh?
Sounds great.
I'll have some more champagne, please.
Some more champagne.
8 pounds, 3 shillings and a penny.
Gather up the rest of the whisky,
Mr. MacKaye. I'll take the cigars.
They must be away.
- First I must get back my stud!
There's little time left.
I've heard it right here by this table.
The monster comes into view each night.
It certainly is old, but aren't you ever afraid that it might fall to pieces?
- It does need a little reconstruction here and there... - Yeah.
- What time is it?
- It's early, Mother.
We ought to get home before midnight.
It's what they call
"the witching hour" for departed spirits.
If you don't stop talking about ghosts, you'll be dreaming about them all night.
Maybe I'm dreaming.
I'd have sworn there was a decanter of whisky on that table a moment ago.
Some whisky for Mr. Martin.
- We're going now, Mr. Glourie.
- Why?
We have no wish to be here when the ghost comes.
My butler tells me there's a bad storm coming up.
I think it would be safer if you started before it breaks.
You see these Highland roads are treacherous and...
But we can wait a few more minutes.
It's almost midnight!
Midnight?
We better leave at once!
- There she goes again!
- Tell her, Mr. Glourie.
Tell her there's nothing like that around here. Unfortunately!
Oh...yes.
Fergus!
Have you ever seen a ghost in Glourie Castle?
Never have I seen one.
And never do I intend to!
I think we better move into another room. It's getting cold in here.
Oh, yes.
I think it would be better.
- Just a minute, Mother.
I counted only 11 strokes.
- But the clock says 12.
I hope I haven't broken anything very valuable.
Sorry, I bumped into one of your ancestors.
It's all right, can I help you?
Are you hurt?
I'm all right, but I suggest that you get a little reconstruction here and there on that chair!
It's quite all right, Mr. Martin.
You see? It's after midnight and nothing happened!
- I'm sort of disappointed.
- The only thing that's happened is somebody sneaked away with the whisky again!
Come on Gladys, we'll take you home.
Goodnight, Mr. Glourie.
Thank you for a nice quiet evening.
Maybe tomorrow we can get together and talk a little business.
Goodnight.
You want to go first, Peggy?
No, you go ahead, Dad.
I'll follow you.
Goodnight, Mr. Glourie.
You've been very kind.
- You will come back, won't you?
- Oh I'll come back, you may be sure.
- Goodnight.
Murdoch Glourie... for the first time in history you've been considerate.
You've done me a good turn, and for that I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Don't thank him, Master Donald.
Thank me.
- You?
- When you were at dinner,
I set it ahead an hour.
That's the right time now.
It's all right, Murdoch. Come forth whenever you please.
Hello! Is anybody awake?
- Who is it?
- That American, Peggy.
I'm terribly sorry to disturb you like this...
Have you forgotten something?
No. I just wanted to tell you about your clock downstairs. It's fast!
- Is it?
- One hour.
But that's not the real reason
I came, Donald.
You don't mind my calling you Donald, do you?
Oh no Peggy, I don't mind.
Well...
The fact is you never really get to know a place until after you've stayed in it a bit.
So would it upset you awfully if
I were to spend the night here?
Oh no, of course not!
But...
- Any old bedroom will do.
But they're all so terribly uncomfortable.
I don't mind.
- And so cold. - But we can light a fire, can't we?
It's not easy to sleep in this castle. You may hear noises.
- What kind of noises? - Sometimes they might be like footsteps.
Sometimes like moans.
- It sounds sort of scary.
Oh, no, no.
It'll just be the wind whistling through the cracks in the walls and rattling the old boards.
Tell me, Mrs. MacNiff...
Is there anything to all this talk about a ghost?
I tell you, Miss:
Whatever you hear, it's only the wind.
Murdoch!
Murdoch Glourie!
I want to ask you a favor.
Be quiet, just this one night.
Come in.
Who is there?
Why, it's Mr. Glourie!
- It is.
Oh, you scared me!
For a moment I thought you were a ghost.
I am a ghost.
I am the famous Glourie ghost, that haunts this castle through the darkness at night searching, searching for a despised MacLaggan.
So that's the explanation!
And I always thought you Scotch people had no sense of humor.
- So you don't believe me?
- Of course I do.
And I think you look marvelous in that fancy dress costume.
It's just what I happened to be wearing on the day of my death and my disgrace.
Your death?
And when did that happen?
I forget the exact day, but...
It must have been about
200 years ago.
200 years?
You look so young.
Don't you know that we never age?
Or aren't you used to us?
No, this is my first encounter.
And I'm surprised that I'm not terrified of you...Donald.
Why do you call me Donald when my name is Murdoch?
Because I'm no more frightened of
Murdoch than I would be of Donald.
I'm glad of that.
I should hate to alarm such a pretty young girl.
And you're the first I've met since the day of that ill-fated battle.
It was a shepherdess then.
I believe.
I'd just started teaching her a game, and she was enjoying it very very much.
- And what sort of a game was it?
- Spell Me a Riddle.
Do you know it?
- No. How is it played?
Well you see, I ask you a riddle.
And if you can't answer by the time I spell "Killiecrankie", you must pay a forfeit.
Now this is the riddle:
What is the difference betwixt a thistle in the heather and a kiss in the dark?
Now you must answer.
K-l-L-L l-E-C-R-A-N
K-l-E.
- I give up.
You must pay the forfeit with a kiss.
No, but first you must tell me!
What is the difference between a thistle and a kiss?
- The forfeit comes first.
- Oh no it doesn't!
- I tell you it does!
- And I tell you goodnight.
Murdoch, my son!
I know, Father.
I must never again let a pretty face divert me from my true purpose.
But it's been such a long long time since I saw one as nice as that...
Everything's all right.
The American came back.
He's in there with Master
Donald now. Fergus is with them.
- Good morning, Donald.
- Hello.
- Is my father still there?
- Yes. You want to see him?
Wait.
I'd like to have a few words with you first.
I like people who do crazy things.
- Crazy things?
Like dressing up and pretending to be a ghost.
You know, you had me almost scared for a minute last night.
Oh, had I?
And when I saw you in that magnificent costume, with the tartan over your shoulder and a big silver buckle...
A silver buckle?
Oh yes, you thought he looked...
I looked well in that?
Oh, much more handsome than you do now.
And gayer, too.
Are you going to tell me the answer?
- To what?
- The riddle you asked me, about the kiss and the thistle?
Oh, no, no, I can't tell you now.
I guess I'll never know the answer until I pay the forfeit.
Well...Here it is!
And now what's the answer?
Oh no, you can't have the answer yet.
But I paid for it!
Do you think one kiss is enough for the secret mysteries of Glourie Castle?
Oh no. That's only the beginning of the thought.
But what else must I do?
Well you'll find out later, Peggy.
Only now I'm busy. Go and talk to your father, he's in there.
Later.
Plus 9 pounds, 3 shillings and
6 pence for last night's dinner.
Plus 4 pounds for my shirt stud.
Remember it's an heirloom of solid gold!
Here's the grand total.
Oh yes. I see.
But you can ask for a bit more than that.
The difference will be yours.
Don't you think just once how marvelous it will be for us to have a real old castle of our own?
All right. But I won't go one penny over 10,000 pounds.
Fine!
I'll go tell Donald!
- No.
I'll tell him.
- Mr. Martin, I thought it over...
Don't make it too hard, Donald.
I want it so much.
- I know you do, Peggy.
But I'm afraid my last price can't be lower than...
2,388 pounds.
- How much did you say?
Here it is.
Well...
That's pretty steep.
But I'll take it.
When can we start tearing it down? - Tearing what down?
Why, the whole works!
We're going to crate it up, stone by stone, and panel by panel, and ship it to America.
You can't do that!
Glourie Castle belongs here, where it's always been!
I'll tell you what I'll do:
I'll give you a contract to come to America and supervise every detail of the reconstruction.
Then...
- No!
I'll never sell it on those terms.
- Donald, please accept the offer.
- I can't.
- Come to America.
- No!
- With us.
No.
This is the castle I was telling you about. I'm taking it back home, stone by stone, and panel by panel.
In fact, I've got some of the paneling crated up right here on this ship.
A much finer specimen than that dinky little chateau of yours.
Oh, Donald!
Shake hands with Mr. Bigelow.
- How do you do. - How do you do.
I was just looking for Peggy.
She's around here someplace with that young Count.
Mr. Bigelow is the man I was telling you about. He bought a chateau.
Mr. Glourie used to own my castle.
So you're the castle salesman, huh?
Congratulations.
And if you ever want a job in my sales force, it's yours.
Thank you very much. If you'll excuse me, I'll go and find Peggy.
What's the idea of congratulating him and then offering him a job?
I'm always on the lookout for brilliant young men who can sell anything.
That darn dog!
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm all right.
By the way, have you met?
- Mr. Donald Glourie, Count Olivero.
- How do you do.
- How do you do.
That wretched dog has run loose again. Donald, would you mind?
Certainly.
- You play ping-pong? - No, my brain could never work fast enough.
No, your game is Spell Me a Riddle!
What's Spell Me a Riddle?
You know better than I do.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
Listen to me, Ed Bigelow! I'll tell you something about this castle.
It's said to have a ghost.
- Said to have?
Yes, sir. And I'll bet that's more than you've got with that little old chateau of yours.
- And have you seen the ghost?
- No, but...
- And do you know anyone who has seen it? - No, but I can...
I knew it. Very clever the Scotch.
Very clever indeed!
COSTUME BALL

The Best Costumes
Yes, Father, yes.
But I don't know where I am.
Father, father!
What is this strange place?
Where am I?
On board ship, my son.
On your way to America.
But Father, I don't want to go to America!
I don't want to become a confounded colonist.
You have to go my son,
with the old Glourie Castle which you dishonored,
even to America.
Donald.
When you've rebuilt
Glourie Castle in Florida...
- Yes?
- Why not live in it?
You'll want to live there yourself, won't you?
And more.
Peggy, do you know at this moment I'm a pauper?
What's a pauper?
A man who wants something terribly and can't afford even to say so.
Terribly, Donald?
More than that.
Oh I think it's lovely...
I mean, awful.
Poor Donald.
Hasn't it got cold?
You like a rug?
I'll ask you a riddle!
Yes?
What's the difference betwixt a thistle in the heather and a kiss in the dark?
Now you must answer.
K-I-
L-L-I-E
I give up Donald, and
I pay the forfeit.
Murdoch! My son!
It's really too cold out here.
I'm going in.
- You like to play a game?
- It all depends.
Well I'll ask you a riddle, and if you can't tell me the answer by the time
I've spelt "Killiecrankie", you must pay me a forfeit.
Now what's the difference betwixt a thistle in the heather and a kiss in the dark?
Now wait a minute, my dear, give me time to think.
K-l-L-L- l-E-C-R-A-N-K-l-E.
- I've seen you before.
- Yes, I think you have.
We played games together.
Yes, you're very fond of games, aren't you?
- I love them. - But you always seem to play the same one.
It's only a means to an end.
I understand, and I apologize.
- Apologize for what, dear lady?
- For having misjudged you.
- Your champagne, Peggy.
- Oh yes. Let's go inside.
It's suddenly become very cold. I'm shivering.
Goodbye, Donald.
- But I'm not Donald!
No, you're not the Donald
I thought you were.
Now go tell somebody else the answer to a riddle!
Oh look! Look!
Look at the Scotchman, isn't he marvelous?
Who are you, beautiful Highlander?
I am a ghost.
I am the ghost of Glourie Castle.
If you please sir, look this way!
Won't be a moment.
Now, smile!
Smile? Why?
Take that infernal machine away!
- What happened?
- I don't know.
- Where is he?
- He's disappeared!
- What the... - The most amazing thing I've ever seen!
Wake up! The most unusual thing has happened!
Elmer! Wake up!
The man that appeared in the ballroom, they say he's a ghost!
I just saw him disappear!
Why did you wake me up after midnight with a silly story like this?
Isn't it All Fools Day today?
I haven't touched liquor the whole night.
He walked right through me, I tell you!
Donald! I don't want you to come in here! Get out!
I'm sorry Peggy, but I can't wait any longer to explain that...
I told you there's nothing to explain! Get out!
Now listen to me, Peggy.
One thing I will not accept, and that is your complete misunderstanding of what has happened.
Did you see someone in an ancient Scottish costume?
- I saw you in hurdle!
- No you didn't!
I know it isn't easy to believe, but what you really saw wasn't a man of flesh and blood at all, it was...
A ghost!
A ghost!
There's a ghost on this ship!
- Where?
Of course there is, Mrs. Martin.
I won't have your horrible castle!
You can take back every one of your cursed stones!
- Mother, be quiet!
- And you can keep the money too.
- It's all you wanted of us.
- Come on...
- What's the trouble?
- Ask him, ask him!
- Your wife's seen the ghost.
- Nonsense.
Let's have a drink.
- It's the truth, Mr. Martin.
The ghost of Glourie Castle's on this ship.
And that Miss Shepperton tells me that she saw him too!
Out of consideration for your wife's feelings,
I think we better call the deal off.
What? Just because a couple of nervous women thought they were seeing something?
But they did!
You've got to believe it!
I'll believe it when I see the ghost myself.
Now you run along Donald and leave Mrs. Martín to me.
All right.
- I'll fix everything.
- All right.
Excuse me, sir. Can you tell me where the ghost is?
- You'd really like to see him?
- Yes, sir.
Newspapers all over the world will be wanting photographs.
I'll do my best.
Murdoch!
Now get your camera ready.
He may be here at any moment.
Good evening, Donald Glourie.
Good evening, Murdoch.
Are you afraid of me?
I haven't been afraid of you since I was a child.
I want to tell you that
I'm gravely dissatisfied with that which has come to pass.
You are dissatisfied?
I suppose you know you've ruined my one chance to do something with my life.
Your life? Ha!
Wait until you've been through some centuries, as I have.
Haunting, looking for something, and never finding it.
Say, Donald, I want to...
Say.
Now I'm seeing things!
No, Mr. Martin.
There really are two of us.
Allow me to introduce my ancestor, Murdoch Glourie.
Ancestor?
Yes, my good man.
I am the Glourie ghost.
No.
You're kidding!
Who is this strange spoken fellow?
This is the new owner of Glourie Castle.
He's going to rebuild it in America.
Aren't you, Mr. Martin?
Yes. Stone by stone, and panel by panel.
Good. It will be pleasant to have a home again.
Goodnight, my friend.
Here, Mr. Martin.
Sit down, sit down.
Have a drink of the best.
Yes, a drink of the best.
Try another whisky.
But Mrs. Martin thinks differently, so there's nothing to do but tear up the contract.
Breaks my heart to do it, but my wife's wishes are sacred!
Mr. Glourie, again
I congratulate you.
And you too, Joe. The wireless is humming with news of the phantom.
It'll be a big story in New York, but don't think you can fool me with any publicity stories about your haunted castle!
It isn't publicity, and it isn't my castle anymore.
I've given it back to him.
- Is this true?
- Yes, I'm afraid it is.
- My wife made me do it.
- Well...
I don't mind telling you,
Mr. Glourie, that I'd be interested in buying your castle!
And your performing ghost.
Really? For how much?
Have a cigar.
Wait! I accept, but no one ever paid so much for a front-page story about a ghost.
Front-page story?
What are you doing?
The whole of America is going to learn that a ghost has crossed the Atlantic to advertise the superior merit of the Bigelow chain...
What? You want to use the ghost of my castle for your nasty cheap publicity?
Tough luck Joe. You never should have let it go.
- Have you sold it to him?
- I thought you didn't want it.
Who says I didn't want it?
How much is this crook willing to pay you for it?
100,000 dollars precisely.
Some will say I've been over generous, but that's the way I am.
- I'll give you 125,000!
- Look here Joe, you can't do that.
See here: My daughter discovered this place, and I won't have her discovery exploited to advertise Bigelow's chain groceries!
But your wife will never consent.
My wife has nothing to do with this now. This is business.
All America will soon know that a ghost just crossed the Atlantic to advertise the superior quality of Martin's Fine Foods!
CITY WELCOMES HAUNTED SHIP
WILL HEALTH DEPT PUT
GHOST IN QUARANTINE?
THREE GHOSTS SEEN ON BOAT
GHOST INVASION FROM THE OLD WORLD
The Congress of the United States of America has the duty to call
the attention of every
American citizen to this outrage.
To import a ghost into our progressive country,
to allow a spirit to pervade the free air of the United States
which might be acceptable
in the effete atmosphere of the British House of Lords,
but not here.
Yes, my noble Lords.
The fairest flowers of
Scottish architecture
are being uprooted from their native soil
to be replanted in an alien land
where the very spirit of Scotland has been prohibited for years.
Not enough this, my noble Lords,
not only our castles, but also our ancestors,
who are being shipped over to please the fancy of a millionaire
who apparently has no ancestors of his own.
Not enough gentlemen, the importation of an alien building,
but an alien ghost is also being imported.
What do our immigration authorities say about this?
What does the great city of New York say?
They accord a civic welcome to this relic of medieval superstition...
BIGELOW GROCERIES
Watch out!
Hey! What are you doing in here?
Hands up or I'll shoot!
Father!
Yes, my son?
I don't like America.
It's worse than the day of the battle.
Then I will allow you to remain invisible
until the opportunity comes for revenge.
But if it never comes?
That is your eternal misfortune.
WELCOME TO SUNNYMEDE,
FLORIDA'S LITTLE PARADISE
THE SCOTCH GHOST SNUBS AMERICA
THE GHOST IN A KILT FAILS TO APPEAR
AFTER HIS SHOWY ARRIVAL
I never dreamed they'd be able to make it look so nice and new.
But I only hope that horrible old ghost hasn't found out where they put it.
Don't worry. He'd never be able to recognize it with all those palm trees.
There's Father!
Hello, Dad!
Don't I look like a real
Scotsman now?
Well, almost.
You're pretty good at controlling your enthusiasm, but I'm glad you changed your mind and came down to the big inaugural ceremony.
I didn't come down for that.
I came to see you.
But what's the idea of the gondola?
That's just sort of a
European touch.
Look at that chandelier!
I had it made especially in
Bridgeport, Connecticut.
It's a lot better than all those old smelly candles, eh?
Don't you think we've done a wonderful job of the reconstruction?
Yes Donald, I think you've done fine.
The modern improvements were all Mr. Martin's idea.
But have you really got rid of that ghost?
We've done much better than that!
We've trained him.
Eh, Donald?
Even so, I do not want him in my house.
What's that?
Nothing to be scared of,
Honey. Here.
It's a radio.
Kind of cute, eh, Donald?
I'm afraid I don't fully understand the meaning of the word "cute".
Say, you sound to me like another one of those enthusiasm controllers.
Like Peggy.
She don't like my hat.
- Is Peggy here?
- Yes, just arrived.
Well, come on Gladys.
I'll show you around.
It's going to be absolutely the most magnificent illumination in the history of Florida.
Are you coming, Donald?
Thanks, I'll join you later.
What are you saying?
Open the window!
You were right, Peggy!
I should never have let them turn this castle of mine into an advertisement for groceries!
I've made a fool of myself Peggy, and all because I love you!
If I could talk as well as Murdoch,
I'd have told you long ago that
I love you, but now I must go, and all I'll be able to say is "goodbye".
But I want you to hear that!
What was that, Donald?
What were you saying?
Well...I was...
Donald, the moat is leaking into the wine cellar.
Come and have a look.
All right, Mr. Martin.
I was only trying to tell you that tomorrow I must go.
Donald!
WILL THE GHOST SHOW HIMSELF?
CASTLE INAUGURATION TONIGHT.
PSYCHIC SOCIETY INVITED TO VERIFY
THE EXISTENCE OF JOE MARTIN'S GHOST.
Now we better rehearse that again.
Now you understand?
When I say, "Silence, dont you hear a strange noise?"
- Yes, sir.
- Careful.
Silence!
Don't you hear a strange noise?
That sounded perfect, Bondsdale.
Donald, you stop behind that chair...
Yes? What do I do then?
You say something like...
"Joseph J. Martin and guests,
I greet you."
I'm sorry Mr. Martin, but the
Glourie ghost wouldn't come here especially to extend greetings.
Well okay, say whatever you think's suitable.
But you better run on along and get dressed now, because it's 10:30, and the supper will be starting soon.
And remember! You don't come in until you hear the tray fall, on the line:
"Don't you hear a strange noise".
That's right. You've got it.
- Who is it?
- Are they going to stop?
Mr. Bigelow, do you care to make a statement?
- What kind of a statement?
- We're going to broadcast these events tonight. - Very interesting.
The radio audience wants all possible angles on the ghost.
I'll tell you boys, my angle is this:
When my good friend Joe Martin bought this castle from
Mr. Donald Glourie, it was understood that a ghost went with it.
You see, Mr. Donald Glourie is a Scotchman, and the Scotch are a clever race.
Then I can quote you with saying that the ghost is a fraud?
I'm not saying that.
Not precisely that.
Mr. Martin, if you don't mind my saying so,
I don't think that costume is quite appropriate to a serious scientific meeting like this.
Why, what do you mean?
I have to be faithful to the spirit of this old castle, don't I?
And besides, I know of no one in the United States who has a better right than me to a geniuine Scotch costume.
- Good eveining, Joe.
- Hello, Ed.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Mr. E. L. Bigelow, who does not believe in ghosts.
Say, why did you put on a disguise?
In honor of your friend, the ghost!
Let me tell you, Ed Bigelow,
Tonight's meeting is scientific.
It is not a fancy dress party.
I'm quite aware, Joe, of the importance of the gathering, but why your own disguise?
I've just been explaining that no one in the United States has a better right.
And now folks, we're going to hear some real Scotch music!
Dad!
Hello. Oh, you're all dressed up.
Are you coming downstairs?
I might come down later.
Is Donald there?
No, he's...gone.
Gone? Where?
I don't know. Away.
But he didn't tell me he was leaving tonight.
You see, he was in a hurry.
And so am I.
Are you really coming down?
No, I don't think I will, now I...
I think you're right.
It will be terribly dull.
Goodnight, Peggy.
- Goodnight, Dad.
Well Donald, they're all here, including Ed Bigelow.
We're going to have a fine time.
- Fine for you perhaps but for me...
All you've got to do is come in, look like the ghost, and then leave.
I know. But it makes me feel such a fool.
You're not backing out, are you?
Oh no. I promised to do it and I shall do it, to the best of my ability.
I have a little present for you here. Look.
Oh yes. Thanks very much.
But I haven't been able to get any whisky out of it.
I don't believe you examined it very closely.
Nice idea, isn't it?
You like it?
- Oh yes, I love it.
I can hardly wait to see Ed
Bigelow's face when you blow in!
Now that's enough!
That's enough!
The music is beautiful, but we mustn't have too much of it.
That's true, but why do you have any at all?
You don't know about that.
You see, it's an old Scots' custom during dinner.
- I don't see Mr. Donald Glourie.
- No, he's...he's gone away.
I see. I thought perhaps that empty chair at the end of the table had been saved for him.
That chair has been reserved for our guest of honor:
Murdoch Glourie, who died 200 years ago.
Murdoch!
Murdoch Glourie!
Aren't you afraid of
Murdoch Glourie?
I couldn't be afraid of anyone
I've known for such a long time.
I'd like to talk to you,
Murdoch Glourie.
And what can a beautiful young girl have to say to a dreary old ghost?
When I first saw you that night in the old castle,
I didn't know what...
Who you were.
Do you remember?
- Yes, I remember, Peggy.
That's the first time you've called me by my name.
But when you say it, it sounds as if you're really Donald.
But if he were speaking to you, you wouldn't listen.
He won't speak to me again.
He's gone.
He wasn't very much interested in me.
- I think you're mistaken, Peggy.
- How do you think that?
Well, because I know him.
He's one of those stupid men who are afraid to be sincere.
He thought you were laughing at him.
I guess I was stupid too.
I couldn't say what was in my heart.
But if he were to come back and say what's in his heart, that he loves you?
If he loved me, he wouldn't have gone away without saying a word to me.
But he wants to say a lot of words to you, and he may not be very far from here.
What would you say to him, Peggy?
I would tell him that I love him.
But he won't come back.
He will come back Peggy!
I promise you!
Silence!
Don't you hear a strange noise?
He's seen him!
The butler's seen him!
Look sharp everybody, he's about to appear.
- Quiet, please be quiet.
- I don't see a thing!
- No, but you will.
- I've got my glasses on, but I don't see anything unusual.
- Where is he?
That's funny,
I distinctly heard sounds like rattling of chains and moaning.
- Chains and moaning?
- Yes, possibly the ghost was just passing near here.
But he'll be back later.
Maybe the phantom's wristwatch is slow and he doesn't know it's past midnight.
Why don't you send one of the servants to page him?
We are bringing you a broadcast
of the big reception for the famous phantom of Glourie Castle.
Outstanding amongst the guests is Mr. E. L. Bigelow,
who expresses the opinion
that the whole ghost story is no more than a gigantic hoax.
Mr. Bigelow has made personal investigations
which indicate that the Glouries are not really a great Scotch family.
Mr. Bigelow follows this
with several other accusations against
Mr. Martin and Mr. Donald Glourie.
He has asked us however
not to make these public until the end of tonight's experiment...
What's the matter, Joe?
Do you hear some more groans or moans or clanking?
The ghosts is here somewhere, but I guess he got lost.
I'll go and find him myself.
- Try whistling for him.
Why, Donald!
I thought that you were gone.
There's been some mistake.
In fact, a rather serious mistake.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I think I can inform you that we shall see no phantom tonight.
Forgive me Mrs. Martin, but there's something I must say to Mr. Bigelow.
Go ahead and say it my friend.
I'm listening.
It had better be said outside.
Then I'm afraid you'll have to wait until I'm ready to leave.
I see that you and Joe are wearing the same tartan.
Do you belong to Martin's
Fine Foods' clan?
Don't you talk to him about tartans! He's a real Scotsman.
Possibly, but I happen to be connected with a family far more important than the Glouries.
I've never heard of the clan Bigelow.
No, this tartan belongs to the clan of my mother's ancestors, of which I am the last representive.
It's the tartan of the distinguished clan MacLaggan.
- Did you say MacLaggan? - Yes,
MacLaggan. Take your hands off me!
Murdoch! Murdoch!
Did you hear that?
Where is this MacLaggan?
Right there.
The fellow with the kilt.
Very good joke, Mr. Glourie.
Very amusing, indeed!
Get away from me!
MacLaggan!
I told you to get away from me!
I don't like practical jokes!
You're not scaring me.
Turn, MacLaggan!
Now, will you have the goodness to repeat these words after me?
Yes sir. Yes sir.
Anything you say, sir!
In the name of every MacLaggan whoever disgraced the fair name of Scotland...
In the name of every MacLaggan whoever disgraced the fair name of Scotland...
I humbly apologize for the insult to my superiors, the Glouries.
I humbly apologize for the insult to my superiors, the Glouries.
And I freely admit that one Glourie can thrash 50 MacLaggans.
Can thrash 50 MacLaggans.
Now, touch the floor with your nose.
Farewell, last of the MacLaggans.
Father! Father!
Is that enough?
Yes, my son!
Your mission is fulfilled,
and now if you wish,
you may join your noble ancestors in Heaven.
I do wish, for I have grown very very weary of this earth.
Thank you Donald, for finding me a MacLaggan.
It was a pleasure, Murdoch. And now I suppose you'll be leaving us.
Yes, I'm very happy to go.
I leave you now to defend the honor of our great name.
Farewell, last of the Glouries.
Farewell, kinsman.
Now smile, smile.
The reporters are here.
They want you to make a statement about that famous fraud, the Glourie ghost.
Is it true that you saw it,
Mr. Bigelow?
What did he look like?
- Did he say anything?
- Did he do anything?
Leave him alone, he's not feeling so good.
Come now, I want you to see absolutely the finest display in the history of Florida, provided by Martin's Fine Foods.
And now Donald, why don't you tell me the answer to the riddle?
I can't tell you the answer, but for the honor of the Glouries,
I must give you back the forfeit. subs by ironhills for KG
Ripped, corrected & synched by Fingersmaster. Enjoy!
Here’s a toast to you, Paul.
You’ve torn my Pierre away from his books and made him enjoy himself for once.
Oh, don’t thank Paul.
It was for you I came.
Then I must drink a toast to Camille.
Oh, no, Paul.
You’ve had four glasses already.
That’s nothing.
For last year’s carnival night, I had 14.
Dupin, Paul!
Look at the Arab dancers.
This way. This way.
See the naughty nautch nymphs.
The adorable Arab angels.
Come, we must continue our studies of anatomy.
Yeah, much nicer than... than visiting a morgue.
...marvelous performance of dancing.
We have Lady Fatima!
Lady Fatima’s snake imitations...
Do they bite?
Oh, yes, but you have to pay extra for that.
Mignette, do you think you could learn to do that dance for me?
No.
No?
Well, then...
I guess I’ll have to join the show.
See, Pierre, how brown they are.
Is that their real color, do you suppose, or have they painted themselves?
Shall I find out for you?
Don’t you dare.
Introducing
Col. Ha-ha from America!
Bloodthirsty savages from the wilds of America!
See the redskins scalp their victim.
First time in Paris.
They are Apaches, my friends,
Apaches.
Like our own waterfront rats.
Just as wild.
That’d be a good name for our bandits.
Apaches.
Ha, Apaches, why, splendid.
Would you like to try whether they are real?
I?
And leave you unprotected?
Never.
Oh, Pierre.
Let’s go in there.
Attention, attention, ladies and gentlemen.
Step closer. Closer.
Behind this curtain is the strangest creature your eyes will ever behold.
Erik, the ape-man!
The monster who walks upright and speaks a language even as you and I.
The ruler of the jungle, whose giant hands can tear a man in half.
Erik, the ape-man.
The beast with a human soul.
More cunning than a man and stronger than a lion.
Step up, ladies and gentlemen.
Step right in.
Shall we go into this one?
All right.
Soldiers and children, half-price!
Step up, ladies and gentlemen.
Don’t miss this opportunity.
That’s good.
Let’s go down there.
Oh! Let’s sit over there, love.
No, mademoiselle, not there.
Take a seat in front so that you can see everything.
This gorilla killed six men, you see.
What a funny-looking man.
He’s a show in himself.
Did you notice his accent?
I wonder where he comes from.
I never heard an accent like it.
Silence.
I’m Dr. Mirakle, messieurs, mesdames.
And I am not the sideshow charlatan.
So if you expect to witness the usual carnival hocus-pocus, just go to the box office and get your money back.
I am not exhibiting a freak, a monstrosity of nature, but a milestone in the development of life.
The shadow of Erik, the ape hangs over us all.
The darkness before the dawn of man.
It’s all right.
Don’t be afraid.
It’s only a baboon.
I-I’m not afraid.
Neither am I.
Listen to him, brothers and sisters.
He is speaking to you.
Can you understand what he says or have you forgotten?
I have re-learned his language.
Listen.
I will translate what he says.
My home is in the African jungle, where I lived with my father and my mother and my brothers and sisters.
But I was captured by a band of hairless white apes and carried away to a strange land.
I’m in the prime of my strength.
And I am lonely.
Here is the story of man.
In the slime of chaos there was the seed that rose and grew into the tree of life.
Life was motion.
Fins changed into wings.
Wings into ears.
Crawling reptiles grew legs.
Eons of ages passed.
There came a time when a four-legged thing walked upright.
Behold, the first man.
Heresy!
Heresy?
Heresy?
Do they still burn men for heresy?
Then burn me, monsieur.
Light the fire.
Do you think your little candle will outshine the flame of truth?
Do you think these boards and curtains are my whole life?
They are only a trap to catch the pennies of fools.
My life is consecrated to a great experiment.
I tell you, I will prove your kinship with the ape.
Erik’s blood shall be mixed with the blood of man.
What does he mean?
I wish I knew.
Mesdames et messieurs if any of you wish to make the acquaintance of Erik, come forward.
There’s no need to be afraid.
He is behind bars and cannot hurt you.
Let’s go up.
Oh, no, Pierre,
I’m afraid.
I’m not afraid.
He likes you, Camille.
Look, he wants your bonnet.
Erik is only human, mademoiselle.
He has an eye for beauty.
You have made a conquest, mademoiselle.
Pierre!
Erik! Erik, get back!
You fool, do you want to be killed?
Oh, but he has ruined your bonnet.
I will replace it, mademoiselle.
I will send you a new bonnet with Erik’s compliments.
Will you tell me where you live and what your name is?
Never mind, monsieur.
It was an accident.
But I insist.
Where do you live, my child?
It is not necessary, monsieur.
Come, dear.
Follow her.
I must know where she lives.
You liked her, didn’t you, Erik?
Sweetheart.
Have I ever told you that I love you?
Camille, I love you.
Let me look at you.
You’re like a flower, soft and fragrant.
Pure and beautiful.
Darling.
And you’re like a star, too.
A white morning star.
And your hair, it’s full of stardust.
You’re like a song the girls of Provence sing on May Day.
And like the dancing in Normandy on May Day.
And like the wine in Burgundy on May Day.
Oh, Camille, I love you.
And I love you, too, Pierre.
No!
No! No!
No!
A lady in distress?
Who are you?
Come with me.
Where?
My carriage.
No! No!
Why are you trembling at my touch?
Your hand is cold.
It chills me.
Come.
I will help you.
No.
Come.
Be patient.
Are you in pain, mademoiselle?
It will only last a little longer.
Ah, you are stubborn. Hush!
It will only last one more minute, then we shall see.
We shall know if you are to be the pride of science!
Oh, hush, hush!
Now, mademoiselle.
Now.
The clots.
The black spots.
Rotten blood!
You.
Your blood is rotten.
Black as your sins.
You cheated me.
Your beauty was a lie.
Dead?
You are...
You’re dead.
Janos, Janos.
Get rid of it.
Get it away.
Will my search ever end?
Three this week.
Three.
Women, all of them.
Life is hard.
The river is kind.
The river is soft.
It rocks them to sleep.
And asks no pay.
Three women.
Always small.
Always young.
A man?
A woman.
Age?
Oh, any, 1,000 or 30.
Cause of death?
Drowning.
Profession?
Yes.
Identification?
None, she was naked.
Number 13.
Well, Monsieur Dupin, what brings you here so late?
The two women.
What about them?
Monsieur, would you be good enough to show them to me once more?
If you wish, Monsieur Dupin,
I will show you three.
Three?
You mean, there’s been another one?
Yes.
Let me see her.
Yes.
There’s the body.
The same marks.
Marks?
See them?
They’re on the others, too.
Monsieur, you must let me take a specimen of this woman’s blood.
Impossible.
Since that whole body disappeared last week, the inspector is very strict about medical students.
Then you bring it to me.
It’s against all regulations.
Tomorrow night, huh?
Good night, monsieur.
The macaroni’s ready.
And the coffee’s getting cold.
Aren’t you going to eat your lunch?
You give five francs to that old ghoul down at the morgue and... and I have to turn magician and pull a loaf of bread out of my nose so we can eat.
Dupin, you might at least have the decency to come to the table.
Pierre?
Why don’t you go down to the morgue and live there, instead of making a morgue out of our home.
Vampire.
Vulture.
Body snatcher.
Say something.
Come in.
Speak of the devil.
Good morning, monsieur.
You’ve got it, eh?
Yes, monsieur, I’ve got it.
But who knows, at the price of my job, perhaps.
I am a married man, monsieur.
I have children.
And if the police should even suspect that I was holding anything back from them,
I should be put behind bars.
No use, no use, we haven’t a centime.
Yes, monsieur.
I must owe you the money.
The morgue must give us credit.
Then, I will trust you.
Monsieur, the Morgue Keeper, perhaps you have an extra slab for my friend here.
Why not take him in?
He eats nothing, he doesn’t talk.
He never changes his position.
I’m sure he’d make you a very fine tenant.
I’ll pack his things and send them down.
You don’t live badly here, monsieur.
I had to hurry myself up here without lunch.
And now you have to hurry back for your lunch.
Boy, that’s too bad.
Good appetite to you and your quiet guests.
Goodbye.
Good day, monsieur.
If you’d pay half as much attention to your studies as you do to this nonsense, what grades you’d get.
What did you find out?
After the carnival last night,
I performed an autopsy.
The victim didn’t die of drowning.
There was no water in her lungs.
Oh, so that’s what you were up to.
I thought you were with Camille.
Hmm?
Of what did the victim die?
Paul, here it is again.
What?
The same foreign substance in the blood of each victim.
Look, Paul.
All three died from the same cause.
Some strange poison perhaps.
Something introduced into the blood streams that caused their death.
What could it be?
I don’t know.
That’s what
I have to find out.
Oh, Pierre, you must pull yourself together.
Why, you’re becoming fanatical.
Look at yourself in the mirror.
Your eyes are getting glassy.
Just like that old charlatan’s.
Dr. Mirakle, eh?
What did you make of him?
Oh, he’s a faker.
Did you pay attention to what he said?
You mean about us being the product of evolution?
Yes.
Hmm.
Has it occurred to you that he might be right?
Eat your lunch.
Dr. Mirakle.
He’s a strange man.
Pierre!
Mother. Mother!
See what the concierge has just brought up.
Mother, come quickly.
I’m coming. I’m coming.
For pity’s sake, what is it?
What are you so excited about?
See what just came.
A new bonnet.
A bonnet!
Oh, it’s lovely.
Are you sure it’s for you?
My name’s on the box.
Isn’t it pretty?
Oh, now, who could have sent it?
Maybe it’s from Pierre.
Oh, where would Pierre get money enough to get a present like that?
Maybe there’s a card inside the box.
It’s from Dr. Mirakle.
And who is Dr. Mirakle?
You know, I told you.
The funny old man at the sideshow who owns the ape.
Oh, I see.
The ape took your bonnet, and the gentleman’s replacing it.
Well, that’s very nice of him.
It’s a beautiful bonnet.
Shall I wear it to the picnic?
Why not?
I wonder how he found out where we lived.
But didn’t you tell him?
He wanted to know.
But Pierre wouldn’t let me tell him.
That’s funny.
Well, anyway, you have a new hat.
Camille? Camille?
There they are.
Hello.
Ah, there she is.
Everybody, ready.
One, two.

Florette,
I am absolutely mad about you.
No, no, no.
Years ago I gave up believing in students.
But, Marie,
I mean what I say.
And here’s to a truthful student, though the animal doesn’t exist.
But, Mignette,
I give you my word.
You will speak to my parents tonight?
But it’s you I love, Susette, not your family.
Whee!
Don’t I look different to you today?
Different? How?
You’re a blind donkey.
Something new I’ve got on.
It’s my bonnet.
Oh, of course, it’s beautiful.
And it’s a gift.
A gift? Well, well.
Who from?
Guess.
Honoré, that poet.
Guess again.
That butterfly collector,
Moreau?
Oh, Pierre, you’d better give up.
It’s from Dr. Mirakle.
Mirakle?
Mirakle.
Yes. Wasn’t it nice of him?
Did he bring it himself?
No, but he sent a note.
So he found out where you live, after all.
And I can’t imagine how.
He must have had us followed.
What did the note say?
He asked me to come to his tent tonight.
That’s strange.
What could he want?
You mustn’t go.
Why not?
I wonder what Dr. Mirakle is up to.
Paul calls him a faker, but he isn’t.
He isn’t an ordinary man.
I’ll go see your Dr. Mirakle tonight.
Very well, Pierre.
Get them poles down to the hallway.
Move this box back.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
How about a little help here, boss?
Lay that over on the way.
Go on, move it, move it.
Get this box over here.
Get this box over here.
That’s right. Now move it.
What’s the matter, Erik?
Are you restless?
Be quiet.
What is the matter?
So, we have a caller.
Dr. Mirakle...
No show tonight, young man.
The carnival is over.
I’ve already seen your performance
Doctor.
I wanted to talk to you.
First, the young lady to whom you sent the hat wants me to thank you for her.
Then she is not coming?
She sends her regrets.
Very well.
Good night.
Are you going away?
Yes.
We move to Munich in the morning.
Excuse me.
I must attend to my work.
I’m a medical student.
And the things you said in your lecture were very interesting.
Have you experimented,
Doctor?
Yes.
Have you written any papers?
None to be shown.
I had hoped you would let me come to see you.
Have you a house in Paris?
No.
I sleep here.
This tent is my home.
Good night, young man.
No, no.
That’s Dr. Mirakle’s stuff.
He’s not going with us.
He’s going to stay in Paris.
Load off.
Pull ahead.
All right, go in the corner.
Erik. Erik.
Let me get this for you.
He got out with the ape, and I’ll swear they were talking to each other.
They went inside, and after that there was no sign of life.
Not a sound.
So you went home?
Well, I dropped in at the morgue.
Pierre.
Pierre, what will you come to?
Why are you always visiting that horrid old place?
Don’t you worry, darling.
Look.
There’s all of our Paris, spread out before us.
I like to see the little lighted windows, twinkling like stars.
Wouldn’t it be fun to know all that was going on inside those houses?
Perhaps it’s just as well that we don’t know.
Think of what all those walls are hiding.
Broken hopes and bodies and hearts.
Absent dreams.
Starvation, madness.
Crimes of the streets.
And tragedies of the river.
Paris. My city.
I hate to leave you alone tonight.
Hold me tightly, Pierre.
I could hold you forever,
Camille.
Good night, dear.
Good night, Pierre.
By the way, you always keep your door bolted at night, don’t you?
Not always, Pierre.
Be sure and lock it tonight, dear.
Will you promise?
If you say so.
Good night.
Good night, dear.
Good night, mother.
Pierre?
Yes.
Mademoiselle, you will pardon the late hour.
But I had to see you.
What do you want, monsieur?
Don’t be alarmed, mademoiselle.
I’m leaving Paris tonight.
And there is something
I have to tell you.
May I come in?
Oh no, monsieur.
My mother has gone to sleep.
My carriage is downstairs, mademoiselle.
We can drive to a café and talk.
Oh, that’s impossible.
But it is of greatest importance.
Please go away.
Mademoiselle, you must come.
Please. Do me this favor.
Let me close the door, or I’ll call for help.
But I have a message for you from Erik.
He talks only of you.
He can’t forget you.
There is something you must know.
Are you insane, monsieur?
Erik! Erik!
There, Erik.
She’s up there.
Gorilla.
Gorilla.
Paul, Paul, Paul, wake up.
Wake up.
What’s... What’s the matter?
What?
I’ve found it.
It’s the blood of a gorilla.
Gorilla?
Those women, don’t you understand?
They died because a gorilla’s blood was injected into their veins.
Camille!
Camille!
Oh, darling, what is it?
What’s the matter?
Tell me, what happened to you, please?
I’ll get you a glass of water.
Oh, my baby!
Mother. Camille!
Camille!
Camille!
Mother.
Hurry up. Give the man a hand.
Someone help me break it down, please.
Help! Help! Help!
What have you got?
What is it, violence?
What do you think?
Uh.
Money. Jewels.
This is not a robbery.
And there’s no body, so it isn’t a murder.
He’s carried her away.
She’s gone.
Who are you?
Where do you come from?
He’s her sweetheart.
He... He comes here every night.
Ah-ha.
Sweetheart.
You may wait for the prefect.
But we must find Camille.
Let me go, you fool!
It’ll be too late.
You may tell all that to the prefect.
Now, what is your name?
Pierre Dupin.
Now, where do you live?
Oh, don’t you understand?
Her life is in danger.
I understand.
Where do you live?
Oh, you fool.
You stupid fool!
So, your name is
Victor Albert Adolph
Jules Hugo Louis Duborg?
Eh?
Yes, sir.
Why did you not investigate when you heard the first scream?
I... I was afraid.
Stupid, incredibly stupid.
Yes, sir. I...
Stupid.
What is your name and business?
I am Franz Odenheimer.
I own a restaurant.
Odenheimer.
In your own way, tell us what happened.
You see,
I was just going to bed.
Then suddenly,
I heard a scream.
Right away,
I ran across the street.
And I was one of the first ones to enter this room.
On the way upstairs,
I heard a voice.
And that voice was speaking Italian.
Do you speak Italian?
No.
Were you ever in Italy?
No.
How do you know it was Italian?
Because I am sure it was Italian.
Ah.
Thank you, sir.
Alberto Montani.
What do you know of this affair?
Well, I, I also heard the voice.
But it was not Italian.
I’m Italian. I speak Italian.
When I ran up the stairs with the others,
I heard the voice.
It’s not Italian, no.
It was Danish.
Do you speak Danish?
No.
Were you ever in Denmark?
No.
How do you know it was Danish?
My intuition.
It was not Danish.
Oh.
I beg your pardon,
Your Honor.
I am a native of Denmark.
Danish is my native tongue.
I heard the voice, but it was not Danish.
It was German.
Italian, not German.
Danish.
German.
I say it was German.
Silence!
Italian.
Danish.
German.
Silence.
Bring in the young man.
Monsieur, the prefect will question you now.
Now, you might as well come quietly.
Don’t try and make any more trouble.
Young man, what is your name?
My na...
Oh, I can tell you who committed the murder and where you can find him.
Who?
An ape.
He’s out of his mind.
If you don’t listen to me now, you’ll be guilty of the second murder.
Second murder?
So you know there has been one?
Yeah.
If you’ll only listen to me,
I’ll explain.
Very well, tell us what you know.
There were two women in this room.
The only door was locked and bolted.
Everybody heard screams and the sound of a terrible struggle.
Within two minutes, the door was broken down.
No one was here.
One of those women was carried away.
I tell you, the other one was murdered.
And her body must be somewhere in this room.
Mother.
Young man, you know too much.
I arrest you for the murder of...
Yes, and another murder may be happening now.
It’s a confession you wish to make?
No. An accusation.
Dr. Mirakle in the Rue Morgue is guilty of four murders so far this week.
And by now, perhaps a fifth.
Do you accuse this doctor?
Dr. Mirakle has a captive ape.
It committed this crime.
No one man could have done this.
Three men couldn’t have pushed that body up the chimney.
I tell you that ape killed her.
And carried her daughter off through the window.
You’re insane.
Come on.
Wait!
Here is proof.
That is not human.
It’s the hair of an ape.
Ape.
Her blood is perfect.
That’s the house, monsieur.
Open.
This is an empty house.
No one lives here.
But it’s not empty,
I tell you.
We must break in.
There’s another door at the side.
We’ll try it.
Police.
I cannot stop now.
Hold them off, until I am ready.
Come, Erik.
Erik.
Erik.
Back into your cage!
Back to your cage. Erik.
Somebody’s barring it.
Open.
In the name of the law, open!
Hurry!
Camille?
He’s dead.
Why, look! There it goes.
It’s an ape!
You fool!
Pierre! Pierre!
Camille.
Name?
Mirakle, I believe, or something like that.
Number 2.
Number 2.
Age?
Oh, any age.
It doesn’t matter.
Profession?
They say he was a scientist or something.
Death caused by?
An ape.
-- English --
Diana?
Yes, mother rukh.
Janos is still in the laboratory, of course?
Yes, he's checking his equipment before the people from england arrive.
I'm to let him know when I see the lights of the car.
It was on such a night that janos first caught his ray from Andromeda.
Your father worked the guides.
I held the detecting lens, and never saw again.
= dear mother rukh.
My son will not learn until too late, I fear, that the universe is very large, and there are some secrets we are not meant to probe.
Janos says the electricity will help the demonstration.
He is wrong to demonstrate to these people.
Who are they?
Pygmies that scoff at a giant, who have said that he is only a visionary, unscientific, a charlatan, huh.
He's greater than all of them.
He sent for them.
If he had waited, one day they would have begged, begged to come to him.
T see the car now.
I'll tell janos.
Janos?
Janos?
= Diana.
They're coming up the grade.
= sir Francis Stevens and the great Dr. benet from the university of Paris.
What do they know?
What will they ever know?
I'll take them somewhere they've never been.
Back into time.
It will work well tonight.
I'm sure and I'm ready.
They'll never laugh at me again.
= janos.
They'll be here any minute.
You must prepare to meet them.
Come.
Yes, yes.
= I'm Diana rukh.
My husband will be here presently.
I'm lady Stevens.
This is my husband, sir Francis.
How do you do?
= and this is Dr. benet.
Madame.
How do you do?
And this is my nephew, Ronald Drake.
How do you do?
May I present you to my husband's mother, frau rukh.
How do you do?
Oh, what a lovely fire.
I hope you didn't have too bad a time coming up.
It really is rather a terrible trip.
Oh, I don't mind anything, but my poor sit-downish husband minded it.
- Brandy?
- Oh, thanks.
That will help.
Thank you.
Would anyone ever expect to find anything like this on top of the carpathian mountains?
No.
= sir Francis.
To see you again after so many years is interesting.
Dr. benet, we meet at last.
But we already know each other.
True.
You've come to see me fail, but you'll be disappointed.
I have come to see that sir Francis isn't deceived.
Your doubts are very flattering.
They are mutual.
We have never seen eye to eye.
That is because I've always looked 200 years ahead of your theories.
= Dr. rukh?
You haven't met me.
Oh, lady Stevens.
Nor my nephew, Ronald Drake.
And you too are a scientist, sir?
No, I'm afraid not.
He doesn't know a thing about science.
But he's one of the three living men who crossed the mountains of the moon, made maps of the country.
And since that's where we're going, he'll come in useful.
Very commendable work, sir.
Good man.
I've seen him tested in Africa.
I read that you were going to Africa.
That's why I asked you here.
Because what I have to show you after dinner concerns Africa, and the claim I made many years ago.
= all of this makes a man like me feel quite small and useless.
But you've gone into uncharted places, too.
Oh, my explorations have all been on this planet.
They reach into space.
= this is the nebula in Andromeda.
A ray from this nebula will be caught here and electrically transferred to the projector in my laboratory.
There I will recreate what is recorded on that beam of light.
From Andromeda?
From Andromeda.
Three-quarters of a million light-years distant.
= can he do that?
Yes.
He will not fail.
He must not.
It would kill him.
Have you seen it?
= no one has seen it but janos.
= you'll wait here a few minutes.
I'll prepare the projector.
He seems very confident.
Yes.
Of course, the theory of reproducing vibrations from the past is not new.
But if proved, would be. = yes.
This may be very interesting.
Yes, very.
Doesn't all this sort of thing ever affect you?
Oh, no, I'm used to it.
My father was assistant here.
When he died three years ago, I married Dr. rukh.
Oh, I see.
I am ready.
A new development of barium crown glass which will protect you from all dangerous rays.
To reproduce what is written upon the beam from Andromeda, we must travel out into space upon that ray of light until we reach a point at which we turn and look back upon our own planet.
We approach the moon.
Dead ashes, where there is no air or water.
In the shadows, colder than our arctic.
In the sunlight, hotter than any desert of the earth.
Saturn we pass, with its twirling rings.
A vast cloud of tiny movements, each moving in its own orbit.
Another constellation speeds towards us.
The great nebula of Orion.
500 light-years distant.
But we travel at a speed far greater than light, the pace of electric magnification.
Otherwise it would take a million lifetimes to reach our goal.
We move by this chaotic mass and see Andromeda, our nearest neighbor among the island universes of space.
The light which we see left there before man existed, before our earth had cooled.
We speed towards this nebula and stop at a point where we will see our own planet, the earth, as it existed long ago.
Years ago, sir Francis, I voiced a belief that a great meteor bearing an element even more powerful than radium, struck an uncharted spot somewhere in the continent of Africa.
If you will bear with me for a moment,
I'll show you how 1 know this to be a fact.
That is all.
=- a trick?
No.
Reality.
But where has it gone?
Back into space.
What did we see?
What you saw tonight actually occurred a few thousand million years ago.
J see.
A tour in time.
Exactly.
Everything that ever happened has left its record on nature's film.
Every sound since eternity began still vibrates, recorded somewhere in outer space.
The cataclysm you witnessed tonight traveled back to us on the ray from Andromeda.
Well, I'm dazed.
Dazed, that's all I can say.
You have demonstrated something that I have always regarded as an unsupported theory.
I'm at a loss for words.
I congratulate you.
Perhaps you'd all like some Brandy.
Oh, thank you, that would be most acceptable.
I'll join you in a few moments.
Well, I, for one, am just beginning to recover from what we've seen.
= t don't think I ever shall.
It was unbelievable.
Well, sir, your discovery is breathtaking.
When do you plan to release it to the world of science?
Oh, not for some time.
It's not nearly ready yet.
And if there should be this meteoric deposit of an unknown element in Africa...
= there is.
It'd be interesting to discover what it is.
Very.
Will you consider joining forces with us and accompany our expedition?
You ask me to join forces with you?
But you forget I have no standing with your scientific congress.
I believe I have even been called unorthodox.
Oh, nonsense.
Our expedition isn't under the auspices of any association.
You will be doing us an honor.
Yes, I'll go with you.
Why not?
No, janos.
Why?
It will not be wise for you to go.
I'm listening, mother.
Even though you may make a great discovery, you'll not be happy.
You are not used to people, janos.
You never will be.
Your experiments are your friends.
Leave people alone.
Where do you suppose that madman rukh is, anyway?
After all, it is his own business if he wishes to go off on an exploration of his own.
See, Stevens, the little creature is going to live.
See his flesh glow.
He moves his arm with much more strength.
Very interesting.
This proves, I think that human organisms are only part of astrochemistry, controlled by radial forces from the sun.
Oh, I never doubted your theory.
What have you been using?
= zithilium.
One milligram, drawn directly from the spectrum of the sun.
Turn it off.
Interesting.
But I must admit I'm quite ready to leave Africa the moment that your experiments are completed.
After eight weeks of this,
I admit that I'm fed up.
I know every wheeze and every crack of every record.
Glad to see signs of rhino about.
We'll go out after them tomorrow.
Yes, you've only got six to your credit.
Oh, well, they're such nasty-tempered beasts, it's a pleasure to dispose of them.
This must be lonely for Diana.
= of course.
It's your fault.
Why do you say that?
Oh, Ronnie, the way you two avoid each other is most pointed.
Why can't you be pleasantly friendly with her as you were at first?
Well, if you must know, I don't dare to be.
Becoming interested?
Yes.
I thought so.
You're in love.
Well, what could be more natural?
An African moon, two healthy young animals.
Oh, stop it.
We're not animals, and that's just it.
And it isn't too easy, so please don't make us into fiction for your book.
Well, you are interested.
Oh, so you're back, Arabella.
Yes, we got an antelope and a fine leopard.
My ankles are worse.
I tell you, I'm getting heartily sick of Africa.
And I don't see any use in waiting for rukh any longer.
It's evident he has elected to desert us.
Well, we can't go and leave his wife here alone, even though he's forgotten she came along.
After all, she is rukh's affair, not ours.
She is my affair.
I'm fond of her.
Well, I'm not fond enough of anyone to make this my permanent abode.
Temba, more water, please.
Ah, ah!
Choco.
The small package.
Boss, put on hat, very hot here.
Boss found place he look for many days now, maybe?
= there's no doubt of it.
No doubt of it.
Safari boys no like this place, boss.
Why not?
Look in pit, fall in, many devil.
= pick me out a runner.
I want to send a letter to the main camp immediately.
Me do.
This boy go.
He very fast.
= hold box.
How long will he take to reach the main camp?
This time tomorrow night, he get there.
All downhill. =- good.
Boss, wants him to wait, bring back answer paper?
Yes.
Now, give this to the young mistress.
Don't say a word about where we are.
And make sure he understands.
Francis, are you asleep?
No, my dear, I was merely trying to imagine myself at home.
I'd give 10 pounds for...
Antelope stew again.
Take it away.
I'm not up to coping with it.
Oh, stop feeling so sorry for yourself.
What new secrets did you draw from the sun today, Dr. benet?
Proof that the sun is the mother of us all.
Is she?
I wonder why she bothers about us.
What are we all about anyway?
Astrochemistry, my friend.
Astrochemistry.
= it's from janos.
Excuse me.
He says very little.
But we're not to expect him back for some time yet.
Where is he?
He doesn't say.
He hopes he's on the trail of an interesting new discovery.
Runner boy want take paper back.
Yes, tell him to wait.
Will you all excuse me, please?
- But your dinner, dear.
- I'm not really hungry.
I want to see the runner boy in my tent.
You come, too, and talk for me.
I'll be ready in an hour.
I want three boys for safari.
Diana?
What are you going to do?
There's only one thing to do.
I'm going to him tonight.
Tonight?
= it's cooler.
Besides, there's a moon.
You're going alone?
I can't stay here now.
Why?
He's a great man, Ronald.
I'm his wife.
He needs me, and I can't let him down.
No, you wouldn't.
You're not the sort to let any man down, ever.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Diana.
Power.
More power than man has ever known.
Well, what do you want?
Safari boys want go away this place.
No like him.
So, they want to leave me, do they?
Me wanna go, too.
= indeed.
Do you see that rock?
Yes, boss.
I want you to keep your eyes on that rock.
Tell the boys to do so, too.
Watch.
No, I sorry, boss!
You can all go if you want to, but you won't go far.
All that will be left of you will be like that.
Me stay, boss.
We'll all stay.
All right, then get back to work.
Take the lamp inside.
Draws the pests.
It's poisoned me.
Dead.
Boss house there.
Me take you.
No, I'll go alone.
Janos?
What are you doing here?
You must go away at once.
At once, do you hear?
= but it's Diana.
You shouldn't have come.
I wrote you I had important work to do.
I don't want to be bothered with anyone.
Oh, you must be ill.
What's happened to you?
Nothing's happened to me.
What makes you think anything's happened to me?
It's been weeks since you left.
Don't you want to see me?
I don't want to see you here.
This is no place for you.
You must leave here at once.
My place is where you are.
I won't be a bother.
I suppose you'll have to stay the night.
My headman will find shelter for you.
But I want you out of here the very first thing in the morning, do you understand?
Yes, I understand.
I'm leaving as soon as it's daybreak.
Yes, missy.
Me tell your boys.
Thank you.
Benet.
Benet. - Rukh?
Don't let anybody know I'm here.
You're exhausted.
= don't touch me.
What has happened?
I made the runner guide me here.
I've traveled day and night.
But why?
I found the place where the meteor fell.
I've discovered an element a thousand times more powerful than radium.
But it's done something to me.
Something horrible.
Horrible?
Look at me.
Look at me in the dark.
Why, you're poisoned.
Poisoned.
And everyone I touch is poisoned.
They die.
= die?
Yes, I khow.
Let's get back into the light.
Perhaps the metal cloth did not protect you.
No, no, it gave me complete insulation.
I must have been careless somehow.
Benet, you know more of the chemistry of the body than any man alive.
Something must be done for me so that I can go back and solve the power of this element.
There is a counteractive for radium poisoning derived from radium itself.
Have you a sample of this new element?
Yes, yes.
There.
Do you think I can be helped?
I can't say until I deduce the atomic structure of this.
I've done that.
You'll find my calculations there.
All right.
Then I'll begin at once to work out the counteractive.
No one must know what's happened to me.
Is there any place where I can hide myself?
Oh yes, there's a little tent in back where I store my instruments.
You can keep out of sight there.
I'll show you.
Wake up, rukh.
Wake up.
You've been asleep for an hour.
Look at yourself.
I gave you the counteractive exactly at midnight.
My hands are not glowing.
No, your hands aren't glowing, nor your face.
I can touch people now?
Yes.
But remember what I've told you.
Nothing can ever cure you.
At best, your state of poisoning can only be checked, suspended.
And now that a counteractive has gone into your bloodstream, you can only live if you use a small amount of it at regular intervals each day all the days of your life.
Here's the formula.
And if I exceed the time, what happens?
Your body again becomes the deadly machine it was.
Your touch will kill.
Shortly after that you will become deadly to yourself as well.
If you do not use the counteractive in time, you will literally crumble to an ash.
Remember, I told you all the conditions.
You accepted the risks.
Yes, yes.
But at least after each treatment, I should be immune.
Normal.
As I told you, I don't know enough yet to say what effect the violent surcharge of poison and antidote will have upon the brain.
Yes.
I took that risk.
= this is the counteractive.
Guard it carefully.
And what do you plan to do now?
Go back to my camp, complete my tests, and return here as quickly as possible.
Tell no one of this.
Promise me.
I promise.
There's no use pretending any longer.
You know that I love you.
I've known it for a long time.
That's why I have been afraid.
= of me?
No, of us.
Oh, Diana, why fight something that's so much stronger than we are?
We must.
Do you love him?
My father idolized him.
When he died, I promised him that I would marry janos.
What are we going to do?
= tt don't know.
Dinner.
We must go.
Yes.
- Yes, boss.
- Where's Dr. rukh?
Boss tent there.
Oh, yes, I want to see him.
= Dr. benet.
How did you find this place?
We listened to the drums.
They talked of a white man who made magic in the mountains.
How are you feeling?
No ill effects so far?
So far, none.
You'd better get out of the sun.
= huh?
Oh, ves, yes.
Some water? = there.
They expected you back in camp long before this.
Yes, I khow.
There was always one thing more to do.
Days passed, and before I knew it, weeks.
I have harnessed it at last, benet.
I could crumple up a city a thousand miles away.
I could destroy a nation, all nations.
You have harnessed its power to destroy.
Have you harnessed it to heal?
That will come later, when I devise a filter to curb its power.
But in the meantime, it's mine to experiment with.
Stevens and I felt that would be your attitude.
That was why we decided your discovery was too important to be in the hands of one man.
Just what do you mean?
Stevens is now on his way to the international scientific congress that opened in Paris last month.
He's taking with him the specimen you left with me.
Why, you thieves!
Thieves!
You forget we came to
Africa for a common purpose.
= it discovered it.
= oh, the credit will be given you for the discovery.
Never fear.
Oh, thieves!
Thieves!
We couldn't wait for you forever, rukh.
Besides, your wife has been quite ill, so we decided to break up camp and go.
My wife? = yes.
She is on her way to Europe with Stevens.
I join them at lake nyanza.
Diana gone?
Stevens' wife is looking after her.
She asked me to hand you this letter.
She doesn't believe I love her.
She loves someone else.
Drake?
Yes.
To come like thieves in the night and steal everything from me.
Get out of here, benet!
Get out before I...
Don't move, mother.
Sit quite still.
In a few moments, we will know.
Look.
Hand, hand.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, I see.
T can see!
You see everything?
More clearly than I ever saw before.
Oh.
I am frightened by what I see.
I have harnessed it, harnessed it.
It's mine at last.
You have work to do that will take you all your life.
Tomorrow I leave for Paris.
No.
No, stay here and work.
I must go, mother.
You will find tragedy there.
I know.
In case I do find tragedy,
I leave my secret with you.
It is all there.
More power than man has ever possessed.
Power to heal, power to destroy.
Guard it for me.
Don't be afraid, my dear.
You will be all right.
= I'm not afraid.
= that is fine.
Load it, please.
I'm Dr. janos rukh.
Come, please.
Baby, baby.
Can you see me?
Yes, mommy, I can see you.
Oh!
My baby.
Where does one find Dr. benet?
I am janos rukh.
= janos rukh?
Dr. benet is in his laboratory.
I will show you there immediately.
Now you must go, make way for the others.
Prepare the next patient.
Thank you.
My baby can see.
My baby can see.
- Yes, mommy, I can see.
- Oh, baby, baby.
= rukh.
I seem to have arrived at an interesting moment.
You have arrived to see what your discovery has done for this little one.
She was blind.
It has made her see.
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, doctor, thank you.
= that's all for now.
It seems, as usual, I am a little late.
No, all Paris is waiting to pile honors on you.
You know, of course, the nobel prize was awarded to you.
Yes, yes, I know, I know.
Everybody considers you and sir Frances Stevens very generous men.
I wondered about your health.
= the counteractive is still effective.
And Diana?
Oh, she is well.
She has become lady Arabella's secretary.
She and Drake plan to marry, of course?
They are in love, but she declares she will do nothing until she hears from you.
She will hear of me, shortly.
I will not stand in the way of their happiness.
This is very fine of you, rukh.
Well, I must leave you to your ministrations.
You see, I was right, rukh.
Your discovery is too great for one man to control.
Some day you will realize that you haven't even scratched the possibilities of radium x.
And I am still the only man to control it fully.
Yes, you'll do.
Same height, same width.
What do I want?
I want to do you a benefit.
Yes.
The greatest benefit one man can do another.
Those who have never seen the moonlight over the African veldt have missed a thrilling vision which can be witnessed in no other land.
A lion caught in the Thorn bush and...
Milady.
Briggs, you have been instructed never to interrupt me when I am at dictation.
- But the paper, milady.
- The papers?
You know I never read them.
This is important.
Oh, very well.
What is it?
With all my worldly goods I thee endow.
With all my worldly goods I thee endow.
Whom god hath joined together, let no man put asunder.
- Goodbye, dear.
- Goodbye, darling.
- Ronnie, dear.
- Goodbye, dear.
I'm sure you'll both be very, very happy.
- Bon voyage.
- Goodbye, my boy.
Goodbye.
Six.
Six of us.
Are you the manager? = yes.
Have you a room vacant?
A front room? - A room?
Providentially, sir, I have.
Step this way, sir.
It's Mrs. legrand, sir, I'm
British to the backbone, though misfortunes and a French husband has brought me to Paris lodgings.
You'll like the room.
It's a lovely fireplace and it don't smoke, and the bed is excellent.
Me poor husband, he died in it so comfortable.
= I'll take the room.
And I'd like the Paris herald every morning.
Yes, sir.
That will be 50 francs a week, sir.
Oh, oh.
Thank you, sir.
Sir Francis Stevens, thief.
Have you ever seen anyone so incredibly happy as Diana and Ronald when they started on their honeymoon?
I hope they will be happy.
We should be late if
Francis doesn't hurry.
Go to sir Francis' room and tell him
Dr. benet and I are waiting.
Poor dear.
When he came from his lecture tonight at the university, he was so utterly exhausted that I told him to lie down.
He is feeling better since we returned from Africa?
Oh, yes.
He has even forgotten to complain about his ankles.
What's that?
Celeste, Celeste.
Speak, you fool.
What is it?
Dr. benet, come up please, at once.
- Pierre.
- Sir Francis.
Sir Francis!
= oh!
Oh.
This is awful.
Look at his eyes.
What hideous thing did he see, do you think?
The police must be sent for at once.
But before they come,
I would like to try an experiment.
It must be done before the eye tissues glaze.
Yes.
= is there an ultraviolet camera here?
Yes, I'll get it for you.
Please.
Rukh.
I knew it.
In New York, in Rome.
= come in.
Good morning, sir.
Good morning, Mrs. legrand.
Oh, there's more excitement.
Yes.
What has happened across the street?
Vandals, sir.
They come in the night and they smashed the entire one of them figures.
They didn't leave nothing but a little pile of melted stuff.
But that's impossible.
That's what everybody says.
But a fact's a fact, sir.
If you'll excuse me, sir,
I'll just pop across and see what the latest is.
Yes, Mrs. legrand.
Do come back and tell me more.
Well, I'll find out, sir.
I won't be a second,
I'll find out all I can.
Lady Stevens, matchmaker.
= radium x claims third victim.
Paris edition of the New York herald.
Radium x claims third victim.
Radium x claims third victim.
Radium x claims third victim.
Radium x claims third victim.
No, please.
It will be better, I think, if you take Diana away.
I will answer any questions.
We'll be downstairs if you do need us.
Now I will explain why I insisted the medical examiner and his assistants wear insulated gloves when they touch the body.
Will you turn out the lights?
Look closely at the neck of the victim.
Lights, please.
You observe those finger marks cannot be seen in the light.
It is phosphorus, possibly?
No.
Radium x.
Inflicted by the grasp of someone contaminated by the poison.
Do you know such a person?
Only one, he is dead.
But there is a story behind all this.
And I am going to ask you to listen to some facts.
= there's some curse.
Diana, my dear, there are no such things as curses.
Well, they needn't look any farther for the murderer.
Here she is. - Stop it!
I won't let you talk like that.
If I hadn't left him, they would all be alive today.
Janos, sir Francis and Arabella.
Stop it.
We loved each other.
We belong to each other.
You never belonged to him.
And no law of nature or man can make it anything but right for us to have done what we did.
He shan't reach out of his grave and spoil our lives.
I'll fight it.
But what are you going to fight?
Something you can't see?
Something you can't reach?
Something you can't touch?
Oh, darling.
Hold me tight.
We're going to need each other so very much.
Yes, I have feared something like this ever since the day he left my laboratory.
And I always doubted his death.
So now you know all I have to tell you.
You believe that the man who was buried as Dr. rukh was not Dr. rukh?
Yes.
I believe that rukh is alive and in Paris.
I believe that this city is at the mercy of a madman whose body is an engine of destruction.
I talked to his mother on the telephone a little while ago, and it is also her belief that rukh is alive.
We will take immediate steps to locate him.
Gentlemen.
A figure melted while a crowd of people watched.
Only one element on earth could have done it.
Diana and I were married at that church, and there were six of us in Africa.
Do you suppose rukh's crazy brain drew some analogy between that fact, and the six figures of the saints on the church?
He killed two of us and destroyed two of the six figures.
= a man and a woman in each case.
You and your wife must go into seclusion immediately.
Also you, Dr. benet, while we comb Paris for this madman.
It might be simpler to get him to come here.
How do you propose this?
Ask him for dinner?
No, not quite.
But that's the general idea.
Let the newspapers give out a story that the three remaining survivors of our African expedition are leaving Paris immediately for an unknown destination.
But before departing, there will be a meeting here.
What sort of meeting?
Well, what do you think would draw him, doctor?
A lecture concerning my recent experiments with radium x, and a chance to reach you and me.
You are both willing to take such risk?
= of course.
Yes.
I will invite a limited number of scientists, to be admitted by card only.
Do you think it's fair to expose them to the danger?
There are only two people he wants to destroy.
Two, or perhaps three.
My men can check the list of invitations at the gate and maybe capture him there.
Also mingle with your guests.
Exactly.
I will set the hour of midnight for the lecture.
At that time his luminosity will be strong as he will delay taking the counteractive, hoping for a chance to use his deadliness upon Drake and me.
If your men fail to capture him at the gate, and darken the entire house.
His face and hands will appear like, like phosphorus, regardless of any disguise.
And if he touches anyone?
They die.
- Professor lemaire.
- Professor lemaire.
- Professor gothe.
- Professor gothe.
- Dr. benet.
- Professor reinhardt.
A very strange hour for such a meeting, don't you think?
Perhaps.
But radium x is a very strange subject.
Benet has his reasons.
Undoubtedly.
He must have something of importance to show us.
Even the president of our congress is here.
Professor meiklejohn, if I am not mistaken?
Yes, I am meiklejohn.
Who are you, sir?
Jones, of the university of wales.
We met once, but perhaps you don't recall me.
= t think I do.
One meets so many people.
I shall never forget your treatise on radiation, sir.
Oh, you remember that, huh?
No doubt you are on your way to Dr. benet's demonstration.
= it should indeed.
I understand that no one is to be admitted without a card.
Yes.
Oh, that reminds me.
Yes, yes, I've got it.
Forgetful sometimes.
Well, under the circumstances.
= of course.
A nasty night.
Most disagreeable indeed.
I think I've caught a chill.
Napoleon Brandy, sir.
I believe a sip or two would help us on our way.
I suggest that we step in here, out of the rain.
I am not very much on spirits, but considering the night, why.
Dr. Reno. = Dr. Reno.
- Dr. Fergie.
- Dr. Fergie.
- Professor meiklejohn.
- Professor meiklejohn.
All are here, except one name.
To be admitted instantly.
Beaudine, you will stand at the main house switch.
It is to be thrown at exactly 12:00 o'clock.
No stranger has tried to come in, and all invitations are accounted for.
Perhaps he won't come.
He will be here.
Probably he's here now.
Monsieur le president.
Oh, Dr. benet.
If you will be patient for just a few minutes longer,
I will make final adjustments in my laboratory and be ready.
We expected you.
T knew that.
Five thieves.
Two are gone, three are left.
Do you intend to kill us all?
Yes.
I felt it was better to let things alone when you were first poisoned.
I warned you about your brain.
It began to affect my brain almost immediately.
I could feel it coming, crawling for cells.
Aren't there ever moments when you think as you used to think, when you were human?
Not often now, not often.
= and because of that we must die.
No, because you are thieves.
Five thieves, all thieves.
It will be easiest just to shake hands.
It will all be over in a second.
My wife?
In her room with Mrs.
Noyer, as you desired.
But she's nervous, sir.
So am I.
Still, it will soon be over, one way or the other.
Yes, sir.
One way or the other.
I know something awful has happened.
Try to compose yourself, madame.
I can't stand this any longer.
Find Mr. Drake and tell him I must see him, if only for a moment.
= t was ordered to remain here.
Oh, please go.
Oh, as you say, madame.
Madame rukh.
It's good of you to come.
It's my duty to be here.
Where is Diana?
Oh, she's upstairs in her room.
= Ronnie.
Ronnie!
= Diana.
= janos!
Strange Dr. benet doesn't return, don't you think?
Yes, very strange.
Dr. benet?
Dr. benet!
He isn't here.
Yes, he is.
And so is rukh.
Don't go any closer!
Max, Louie, the front stairs.
No, I can't kill you, I can't.
But he must die.
No, janos!
Mother.
No.
= t must have time.
I must go on to reach one more.
Drake.
= don't fire.
My son.
You have broken the first law of science.
Yes, you are right.
It's better this way.
Goodbye, mother.
Dianal
Diana.
My darling, you're safe.
Madame rukh, permit me to pay you my homage.
Janos rukh is dead, but part of him will go on eternally working for humanity.
It's probably a series of coincidences, but the home office is kicking and I'm handing the kicks on to you.
I'm told we're indifferent, complacent, lax, and unimaginative.
That we never move until public opinion makes us and then it's usually too late.
And there's some truth in the accusations.
Five insured persons have been found drowned in the last eight months and not one of you has brought in a scrap of evidence as to who benefited, though all the claims, heavily underwritten, have been met.
What can we do without a lead from the so's office?
They can't move without evidence.
You will have to work alone.
Persuade where you can't command.
Who's got e area?
I have.
Three of the five cases are yours.
You'll have to go through your insurance companies with a fine toothed comb.
Yes, sir.
That's all.
If, as I say, it is simply a series of coincidences, let me have something definite enough to publish.
All right.
Oh, uh, holt.
Yes, sir?
The extradition of the man grogan from America.
He arrives the day after tomorrow and I've made my arrangements, sir.
They think so much of your prodigy in America that they've sent a lieutenant O'Reilly from the Chicago police department along with him.
He'll be staying a while to study our antiquated methods.
I'll attach him to you, then he won't learn anything.
Yes, sir.
Hello, extension seven?
Send me up a pot of tea.
Dr. orloff, I can only be terribly grateful to you for this loan.
I know you for an honest man, Stuart.
I can read it in your eyes, so I trust you.
You do know that in the event of my invention being accepted by the government,
I'll be wealthy again.
If you'd like me to sign a...
Yes.
You might do that.
Would you care to make over your life insurance to me?
I am not insured.
But you should be.
That's the insurance broker speaking, the businessman.
The most charitable man I know.
And the greatest of these is charity.
Yes.
Now, all I want you to do is to sign this simple note to pay me back the sum I am so happy to lend you.
You're a very good man, Dr. orloff.
I wanted to be, Stuart.
I wanted to devote my life to the healing of mankind.
I wanted to be a doctor.
But they got together, those narrow minded, prejudiced medical men to see how they can rule me.
Brilliant, but unbalanced, that was the verdict.
And so I serve the blind.
You mean you...
Here in greenwich, Mr.
Dearborn, himself blind, runs a home for blind vagrants.
If you would like to express your gratitude for the little thing that I have done, send him a donation.
Or better still, go and see his home yourself and learn the joy of giving charity.
I will.
Here.
Here is the address.
Call on him tomorrow evening.
I'll let him know that you are coming.
I most certainly will.
Do.
Goodbye.
Goodbye and thank you again.
Grogan arrives the day after tomorrow under police escort.
He will be allowed bail, pay it.
You're dumb Lou, aren't you?
Good luck to you.
Send this in all the evening papers.
And open the window.
Get out.
Dr. orloff?
Yes.
I am Dr. orloff.
I'm a detective inspector from Scotland yard.
How can I help you?
Well, for certain purposes, we are making a check on all recently insured persons.
May I ask with what object?
Well, it's a formality concerning a case under investigation.
They're asking the cooperation of all insurance companies within a certain area.
Only too willing to help you if I can.
Thank you.
May I see your books?
Uh, certainly.
We don't do a great deal of business.
We have only very small connections, you know.
Any particular name you are looking for?
Yes, ingle.
Ah, yes, a sad case.
Why ingle should take his life...
The verdict was found drowned.
Was it?
I had forgotten.
Ingle was insured for 20,000 pounds.
Yes.
Who was the beneficiary?
A woman, I think, not his wife.
It was all quite in order.
Where is she to be found?
I can give you an address, but I have a notion she went abroad.
I'd like it, please, together with his surrendered policy.
Oh, certainly.
Did you insure a miss Ursula sable?
Yes.
She was found drowned too, wasn't she?
Yes, an extraordinary coincidence.
Am I being suspect of foul play?
No, Dr. orloff, but in the public interest, cases like these must be investigated.
Oh, I appreciate that.
Who benefited in the case of miss sable?
Actually, I have to look that up.
Yes, Saul, Samuel, sable.
Oh, yes, Mr. Carlo hesher, a Romanian, I think.
The policy was drawn up as a guarantee for money left.
Well, has Mr. hesher returned to Romania?
His last address was the midland hotel in Manchester.
Well, thank you, Dr. orloff.
Have you all the information you wanted?
I may have to call on you again.
I am always willing to help.
Thank you.
Answer it, Jake.
Hmm, you've been a long time, Lou.
Darkness spread over the earth and neither was the light in the heavens nor on the waters of the earth.
The eyes of men were blinded because of their inequities and the hardness of their hearts, so they remained for seven days that were seven nights and voices of mankind arose, lamenting, give unto us a sign that we may see for we repent our sins and will not trespass again.
And on the seventh day, the sun shone in the heavens, giving light on mountain and on valley, on river and the multitudinous sea.
And they who were blind did see again.
Oh, hello, Lou.
I wish to see Mr. dearborn.
Why, what's this?
Stuart, I'm glad I'm here.
Mr. dearborn has been called away on an errand of mercy.
The pleasure of showing you around will be mine.
Come this way.
Here's where they are taught useful occupations.
Dearborn believes that by contributing to their own keep, they will preserve their independence and self respect.
See how nimbly they work, their fingers are their eyes.
Through there are the kitchen and the dormitories.
It's a splendid work.
Something I'd like my daughter to see.
Daughter?
What daughter?
I thought you had no relatives.
Where is she now?
On her way back from America.
Will she live with you?
I suppose so, for a while, anyhow.
Well, that's surprising.
Uh, where were we?
Oh yes, yes, I wanted to show you my special department upstairs, the medical clinic.
It's odd, Mr. Stuart, isn't it, how life has compensated me.
Compensated?
Oh, yes, with the care of these poor creatures.
Ooh!
I'm very sorry, have I hurt you?
No more than a steamroller would have done.
Nice work, flat foot.
Hey, uh, are you holt?
I'm O'Reilly, Chicago police department.
Hello, hi.
Go on, well educate him.
I say, I'm sorry about that girl.
Ah, she'll get over it.
Here's your man, grogan.
Oh, good to have you back, grogan.
Yes, I'll bet you are.
I won't keep you a minute.
Hey, wait a minute.
I say, I really am awfully sorry.
Is there anything I can do?
No, thanks, I'm taking no more risks.
Taxi?
Oh, I say, wait a minute.
Hey, you wait a minute.
Ha, ha, ha.
Home, James.
Well, grogan, how are you?
Colossal.
I hope you've lost the perishing key.
Yes, where is the key?
Key, oh, I've got it here.
I had it, uh, somewhere...
Is it in your trouser pocket?
Um, you try.
Hey, wait a minute, I know where it is.
Where?
The captain has got it back in Chicago.
I could sock you right on the nose.
I got a good mind to let you.
Well, and who's supposed to be looking after you two?
Oh, that's all right, officer, this is my way of being a joker.
I'm inspector holt of Scotland yard.
Oh, and who's he supposed to be, Dr. Watson?
Come on.
Now, listen to me, will you and...
Hey, wait a minute tell him who we are.
You'll look very silly when I get back to the yard, sergeant.
I'll look pretty silly if you don't you'll be missing a couple of them if you don't look after him a bit better.
I think your english police are wonderful.
You've done very well.
I always said you'd go far.
My only fear was how far.
With the greatest difficulty, I have kept your lower form antics out of the public papers.
Lieutenant O'Reilly, I have to inform you that the yard is a dour, soulless place of business, where hijinks, jitterbugs, and horseplay of the more imaginative kind are severely discouraged have a cigar, commissioner.
I don't smoke cigars.
I understand that bail for the man, grogan, has been offered and will be accepted by court tomorrow.
You want to hold him?
No, sir, not as long as he's under observation.
Very well.
Yes, this is the commissioner.
Yes.
What?
Oh, it's for you, holt.
Hello?
Yes, holt speaking.
British emergency call coming through.
Hello, river police, you're through.
What's the place?
Surrey, old stairs.
All right, don't touch anything.
Yes, I'm coming now, yes, instantly.
Exchange, transfer me.
I want transport m1, another river case, sir.
Holt speaking.
I want a car at the front entrance in four minutes.
In case he should forget to make a mess of it, you'd better go along with him.
Yes, sir.
Anything been touched?
Not a thing, sir.
Step back.
Hey, what is this, quicksand?
Take a dredger a couple of weeks to get that up.
Tailors, hillingram and Curtis.
Name, Henry Stuart.
142 billingham mansion.
Part of a broken cuff link, it's marked hs.
You can't make a homicide case out of half a cuff link.
Ambulance is coming, sir.
All right, have him taken to the mortuary tell the doctor run the rule over him.
Aye.
Keep back, keep back, please.
Make way there, come on, get back.
Fenton, issue the usual notices and try and get him identified.
You're taking a lot of trouble with this case.
Well, perhaps I think it's worth it.
Well, maybe I got a thing to learn.
Maybe you have.
That'll be all.
You can cover him up now.
What do you make of it, doc?
Oh, simple case of drowning.
Mucus froth about the nose and mouth, water in the air passages and lungs, about a pint of it in the stomach.
No marks of violence?
None whatsoever.
It ain't even murder class b.
It's either an accident or suicide.
How long has he been dead, doctor?
About three hours.
Was the water you found in the stomach muddy?
I haven't had time to analyze it yet.
Oh, let me know when you do, will you?
A relative has just arrived, sir, to identify the body.
Well, you wait here, will you?
Right.
- Miss?
- Stuart.
Do you remember me?
I remember.
What's happened to my father?
There's been an accident.
He's dead?
Well, it may not be your father, but we have to make sure.
You must be brave.
Are you ready?
Yes.
Tis?
He was found drowned in the thames.
I think he died quite painlessly, miss Stuart.
I can't believe it.
Perhaps you can help us to throw some light on it.
I can't now.
Can't she take it, that girl?
Without a whimper, too.
Yeah, she's plucky, all right.
For her sake I hope we get an accident verdict.
Sergeant Harris just found this, sir.
It was tucked away in the bottom of the deceased's pocket.
What've you got now?
Looks like a bit of braille writing to me.
Coming?
What I'd like to know is how that cuff link got torn away.
Yes, I'm coming.
Say, what do you guys think this place is?
Sorry, grogan, we've had a busy night.
We're sleeping 'em four in a bed in some places.
Josie just got him a bunk.
Sleeping?
How can anyone sleep next to that laughing jackass?
We all got our troubles, friend.
Ah!
Put a sock it in, chum.
What you in for?
I'm a disgrace.
A disgrace to the family.
Well, that's nothing to laugh about.
What you been up to, murder?
No.
Drunk and incapable.
Well, what's wrong with that?
I'm charged with drunk and incapable and they won't change it.
Hmm.
What do you want to be charged with, highway robbery?
No, I want to be charged with drunk and disorderly.
Then you're in a tough spot.
There you are, my dear, drink that and you'll feel better.
Inspector holt can't be long now.
I'll see if he's arrived.
No, I don't go out for that much either.
Give me a gun and a bunch of hijackers and I'm okay.
Hey, wait a minute.
Tell me I'm seeing things.
What is that?
Hey, that's beautiful.
You fellas get one each, huh?
Miss Stuart's waiting in your room, inspector.
Oh, thank you.
Lieutenant O'Reilly, this is police constable griggs.
Glad to know you, babe.
You certainly gave me a shock.
Lieutenant O'Reilly thought that you were here to supply love and comfort to overworked detectives.
Yeah, that's me.
Then it may interest lieutenant O'Reilly to know that my main duty lies in the promotion of public morality.
Morality, what's she mean by that last crack?
I'm sorry I had to keep you waiting.
Pull up a chair, O'Reilly.
I need hardly say how deeply
I sympathize with you.
May I say at once that I know my father couldn't have committed suicide.
Won't you sit down?
You're sure your father wasn't worried about anything?
No, I don't think so.
Was he in any kind of difficulty?
Not that I know of.
Well, it wasn't an accident.
You mean it was either suicide...
Or murder.
Had he any enemies?
I don't know, but I'm going to find out.
Did he know anybody who was blind?
I don't think so, not to my knowledge.
Could he read the writing of the blind?
Braille, I mean.
Why do you ask?
I don't know.
Probably lead nowhere.
Now, look here, I don't want you to communicate with any stranger without first letting me know.
You don't think I'm in any danger.
I don't know what I think yet, but I'd like you to do as I ask.
Very well.
Oh, Jackson, show miss
Stuart out, will you?
And ask sergeant Morrison to come in.
Goodbye.
Bye.
Your bag, miss Stuart.
So that's why you're so interested in this case.
We're not all like you.
What do you mean?
Oh, ask a policewoman.
Well, did he fall for it?
He did.
Hey, what's going on around here?
He's been spending the night in the cell with grogan.
Did he steal anything?
Made a grab for me paper.
What'd he want?
The agony column.
This.
G-r-Oo j-u-h-h-b-i-d.
Hey, what is this?
Ask codes what they make of this, will you?
Right, sir.
And I'll have grogan up now.
Do you want me again, sir?
No.
Send up 249, please.
Now, holt, this is where I come in.
Just leave that bird to me for a few minutes and I'll have him talking faster than Max Miller.
There's no third degree in this country, O'Reilly.
We catch our crooks by kindness.
You'll see.
Ah!
Listen, you can't do this to me, holt.
Take it easy, grogan.
I'm entitled to a night's rest the same as anyone else.
All right, Fred, I'm gonna see you're made more comfortable.
Look, holt, let me have this guy for just two minutes.
Now, listen, Fred, I don't want to press this charge against you.
When you go up in front of the beak in the morning,
I'm not going to oppose bail.
Why don't you give him a civic reception?
Who's standing your bail, grogan?
Just a friend, a loving friend.
Oh, you don't feel like telling me.
Not when I'm going to let you out in the morning?
Just put yourself in my place, inspector.
All right, grogan.
And you won't oppose the bail?
No, no, I won't oppose it.
If ever I have a son, which is extremely unlikely,
I'll name him Larry.
Come on, Fred, back to bye-bye.
There's no need to use your hands.
This is no police station, it's a sanitarium.
There's always tomorrow, O'Reilly.
Come in.
Oh, did they make anything of it?
Yes, schoolboy code.
Gro, obviously grogan, written in plain to attract his eye.
The rest is simple code.
The first letter in this case, g, is a.
H is b and so on.
What's the message?
Gro communicate orloff.
Orloff?
Doctor orloff.
Any good?
Well, I don't know.
Except that grogan's strong suit is forgery.
And that piece of paper I found in Stuart's pocket was a message in braille.
Come along, St. Patrick, we will see what the photographers have made of their end of it.
Oh, grogan's going out on bail tomorrow morning.
Have him tailed from the moment he leaves the courts.
Very good, sir.
Call me every four hours unless it's something hot.
Yes, sir.
You've got the prints of the Stuart's exhibit?
Um, yes, they're just through.
Project them, will you?
Uh, Mr. porthrow, project these.
Put another one in, will you?
Have you got a table of the tides?
Now, the pathologist's report says that Stuart died three hours before we found him, near high water Mark at 10:00.
What was the time of low tide on the night of the fifteenth?
6:30, sir.
Then Stuart was drowned near high water Mark, five and a half hours before the tide reached there.
Sure, sure, but the poor palooka was drowned, wasn't he?
And there are no marks of violence.
Thames water is muddy, O'Reilly.
Well, don't I know it, I lost a presentation cigar case in that mud.
Hello, give me extension five, will you?
Dr. wiley there?
Inspector holt.
Dr. wiley.
Hello?
Yes?
It has just been analyzed.
I've got the tube here before me.
The water in the man's stomach was just clean, clear tap water.
Thanks, Andy.
Send up the sample, will you?
Tap water, not river water.
Stuart wasn't drowned in the thames, he was drowned somewhere else and dumped there afterwards.
Well, for the love of Pete!
Extension eight, please.
Hello, Mr. Slade?
Oh, hello, Tim.
Have you had the report on the braille writing?
Oh, good, I'll come along.
Oh, and Tim, order some tea, will you?
Have those sent up to my office, will you?
Hello, Tim.
This is lieutenant O'Reilly.
Lieutenant O'Reilly,
Chicago police department.
Where's the tea?
It's coming.
What'd you make of that braille writing?
Very little.
The water's obliterated the greater part.
The first three letters are m-u-r.
Is that all?
That's all.
Well, there are very few words beginning with m-u-r and one of them is...
Murder.
You said it, big boy.
I'll keep that, Tim, and you can drink my tea.
Remember Tim, Chicago police department.
Goodbye, Mr. o'brien.
Say, honey, you don't have to take care of my morality in the daytime, do you?
Here, it's done.
And you wouldn't have made me do it if I hadn't needed the money.
It's not the first time you've signed a signature that wasn't your own.
It's the first time I've signed one of a guy what's been murdered.
There is no question of murder.
Oh, yes there is.
The cops are saying there is and the papers are saying so, too.
So, you won't be able to come near me over price amounts, will you?
Are you threatening me, grogan?
No, no, I'm not threatening you.
Don't you worry, I won't squeal, I'm not that kind.
No, you won't squeal.
I'll see to that.
Here, what about the dough?
I'm not in the habit of breaking promises.
Put your things away.
Taking out a policy, grogan?
You know Mr. grogan, inspector?
Yes, I do.
How can I help you this time?
Listen, I thought you was gonna lay off me.
What's this man doing here?
I don't understand you, inspector.
I don't like hearing meself talked about, so I'll just hop it home...
All right, O'Reilly let him go.
In case you are not aware of it already, Dr. orloff,
I think you ought to know that grogan's out on bail and that his specialty is forgery.
Taxi!
Milligan Avenue, mate.
Yes, I know all about grogan, inspector.
My volunteer activities include the vice presidentship of the prisoners relief association and grogan was asking my help in his defense.
The nerve of that guy, asking you to put up the
Jack for his mouthpiece.
Your colleague is a foreigner.
I'm not a foreigner, doc, I'm an American.
Over here for a nice little rest and the first thing I run into is a murder.
Murder?
Man named Stuart, found drowned in the thames.
Oh, yes, I read that.
Poor Stuart.
But surely it wasn't murder?
You knew Stuart?
Er, not intimately, but enough to know that he was in a hopeless financial mess.
I did try to help him.
Was Stuart insured with your company?
He was, yes.
And you enter your clients alphabetically in your ledgers?
You mean you didn't see his name entered on the same list with miss sable's.
Mr. Stuart's policy is in a different category.
If Stuart was in financial difficulties, how'd he pay his premiums?
As a matter of fact, uh,
I've paid the last two for him myself.
Perhaps you would like to see the policy.
Will you be good enough to find Mr. Henry Stuart's life policy?
Uh, by the way, I have finished this.
You may return it.
Who benefits by the policy?
Stuart's daughter?
Uh, no, inspector, I'm the beneficiary.
You see, Stuart made over the policy to me when he couldn't meet the premiums, in return of the loan of 2000 pounds.
This is the policy and this is the receipt for the loan.
Suspecting a forgery, inspector?
You mind if I fill my pen?
Uh, this is copying ink.
Use this.
I hope you are satisfied.
As satisfied as a detective ever is.
Thank you.
Don't hesitate to call on me whenever I can be of assistance.
I won't.
So long, doc.
Give me the list of the underwriters covering the Stuart policy.
General life, 9,000.
Chapman and underhill, 5,500.
Approved annuities, 5,500.
All together 20,000 pounds.
Claim on them at once.
And uh, find me poor Stuart's number in the phone book.
I want to communicate with his daughter.
Here, whatcha?
Oh, blimey!
No!
Hey, you're wearing me out.
Where are we headed for now?
We interview Mr. grogan on the fascinating subject of forgery.
You're working too fast, what about the murder?
Grogan?
Grogan.
Grogan?
Lord almighty.
All right, do what you can with the poor devil.
I'm afraid we're too late, though.
Don't they ever shoot anybody in this country?
Now listen O'Reilly, we're onto something, we ought to work fast.
You mean faster.
Put the light on, will you?
Hello, give me whitehall
1212, quickly, please.
Poor old Fred.
Hello?
Hello, send a doctor round to grogan's pad at once, please.
And listen, you can take the men off his tail, he's slipped past you for good, I'm afraid.
Now I want...
What?
When?
No, don't do anything,
I'm coming along now.
Diana Stuart's gone over to orloff's house.
How do you know?
She telephoned.
That girl wants her so and so smacking.
Nice work if you can get it.
Miss Stuart, I asked you to visit me because in a way I feel a certain responsibility for your welfare.
Thank you, Dr. orloff, but there's really no need.
I have a little money of my own and I shall work.
What do you intend to do?
First of all, find the man who killed my father.
You're very determined.
Wouldn't you feel the same?
Of course.
But don't let your sorrow dwell on your mind.
Work will help to heal it.
Now, I have a very dear friend, runs a home for the blind.
He himself is blind, needs a secretary who can see to help him.
Oh, I should be very grateful, Dr. orloff.
Then I will arrange it now.
You are very kind.
Dearborn, this is orloff.
Oh, the young lady I spoke you about.
Yes.
She's very interested.
Yes, yes, she's ready to commence work right away.
Quite right.
Yes, goodbye.
There.
Thank you, Dr. orloff.
And the question of salary you can safely leave to me.
And now I'll say goodbye.
My man has a taxi waiting for you.
Now, don't brood on the past.
Think on the future.
See miss Stuart to her taxi.
Goodbye, miss Stuart.
Goodbye.
Where to, miss, please?
Bellingham mansions, palace gate.
Bellingham mansions, palace gate.
Driver, stop, you're going the wrong way.
All right, miss Stuart,
I know my way about.
You!
And the I on the back is for Larry.
Didn't I tell you...
And I phoned your office.
And Dr. orloff wanted to talk to me about father, so...
Now, listen.
Another man was killed tonight because he knew something about your father and it might just has easily have been you.
Oh, but that's awful.
But it couldn't have made any difference to me seeing Dr. orloff.
All he wanted to do was to help.
He's found me a job with Mr. dearborn at his home for blind men.
You've got plenty of guts, haven't you?
And you want to see this thing through?
You know I do.
Right.
Now, somewhere between orloff's office and the dearborn place is the answer.
That's all I know.
Now, you go there, keep your eyes open and keep in touch with me.
I'll never be far away from you.
All right.
And now, where to, lady?
Bellingham mansions, please.
Whoa!
I devoted my life to this work, miss Stuart.
But I cannot help these poor fellows as much as I would like to.
My own blindness prevents me.
Hard to believe you're blind.
You move about so easily.
Haven't you heard of the sixth sense of the blind?
Every sorrow in the world has its compensation.
Now, come, let me show you these poor fellows.
Listen, men.
I want to introduce miss Stuart to you.
She is going to work here and help us.
Are her eyes dark like ours?
No, she can see.
See?
All right, men.
Go back to your work.
We'll ask the doctor,
Lou, what it is.
I'll ask him.
This is our little hospital.
It was given us by Dr. orloff.
If anyone gets ill, he comes here and attends to them.
Well, how's the patient?
What's wrong with him?
Nothing serious.
Dumb Lou is a very good musician, miss Stuart.
I should like to hear him play one day when he feels a bit better.
Lie still.
Lie still and rest.
Come, miss Stuart, we shouldn't disturb him anymore.
You heard what he said,
Lou, you must lie still.
Somebody's here.
Who is it?
I'm inspector holt of cid.
I had an inquiry to make, so I took the Liberty of coming right in.
I'm at your service, inspector.
Here is a piece of paper.
On it is written a message in braille,
I wonder if you'd be good enough to read it to me.
The first letter is m.
I can't tell you what the rest are.
They are not decipherable.
That's a pity.
What is the import of the paper?
They were found in the pocket of a drowned man.
You distress me, inspector.
So unless you wish my help further,
I will ask you to excuse me.
Certainly, Mr. dearborn, and thank you.
Ring him at six.
All right.
Thank you.
Miss Stuart, after you've prepared the paying in book for the bank tomorrow, you may go.
And should Dr. orloff arrive, please tell him I'm very anxious that he attends to Lou without delay.
Very well, Mr. dearborn.
You think the old boy was foxing?
What ever gave you that idea?
All right, let's head back.
How is he?
Did my injection have the desired effect?
Try to find Mr. dearborn, Jake.
I shall have to make another experiment.
Sit up.
You have been very foolish, Lou.
You have been writing on little bits of paper.
The police have been here.
They might come back, Lou.
They might ask you questions.
You're blind and you can't speak, but you can hear and that will never do.
What? What, what was that?!
Hello, Dr. orloff.
Good evening, miss Stuart.
Lou is all right now, I have been attending him.
Good evening.
Goodnight.
You know where the young lady lives, Jake.
She's a difficult young woman, Jake.
Perhaps you'd better see her safely home.
It's ironic that Stuart should be carrying in his pocket a message that was to cause his own death.
A message sent to a blind man yes?
Investigation bureau.
Henry Stuart was insured by the greenwich insurance company for 20,000 pounds.
Three firms underwrote the policy for the full amount.
Got him.
Who?
Orloff, Dr. orloff.
You mean that nice doctor guy?
Now, listen, I've been checking up on that nice doctor guy.
Doctor, I thought it was bogus, but it isn't.
He'd be a practicing physician today if a megalomaniac streak hadn't got him into trouble years ago.
Now he runs an insurance company.
He takes out bogus policies, forges the signatures of carefully selected people and lays off to some of the underwriters.
Yeah?
He waits a reasonable time in paying the premiums and everything is straight and above board.
Then neatly bumps them off.
Collects the money from the underwriters, makes a fictitious entry in his book saying the money has been paid out to persons who don't exist.
Hello?
Hello, Diana, yes, I'm glad you rang.
Listen...
You listen.
Just before I left, I had to go through dearborn's accounts and I found a check from my father that hadn't been paid in attached to a letter saying that Dr. orloff was arranging for him to pay a visit to the home.
Does it say when he was going?
Yes, he was to go on the evening of the fifteenth.
The evening of the night before we found him.
Does it say anything else?
No, what do you want me to do?
Just a minute, something's happened to the lights.
Hello?
Hello, hello?
Diana, what's happened?
Diana!
What's the matter?
I don't know what.
For god's sake, get me a car and hurry!
Bellingham mansions, palace court.
Come on, let's bust.
Right, ready?
It was Jake!
Jake, the man from the blind home.
Larry, you don't want me to go back there now, do you?
I can't, I daren't!
Yes, you dare.
I've got to have sufficient proof that orloff's a murderer and his last victim was your father.
All right, I'll do it.
But you will be near, won't you?
I will.
Ah, I missed him.
There's a fire escape out there.
Still, it was good to hear the old music box again.
Well, what next, Sherlock?
Well, as the walrus said to the carpenter, the time has come.
We'll call out the squad and surround orloff's office.
Atta baby!
I'm coming with you.
You bet your life you are.
All right, stay with miss Stuart,
I'll call you if I want you.
Search that room!
Boy, oh boy!
Well, it looks like he beat you to it.
Yes.
What a payoff.
He won't get far.
Hello, Scotland yard.
Hello, holt speaking.
Get this over to the hue and cry.
Wanted for murder, doctor orloff,
48, hair graying, blue eyes.
In spite of a nationwide search, orloff has so far managed to evade capture.
Every hour reveals the magnitude of the insurance crimes he so diabolically engineered.
It's incredible this man, who is our benefactor, should have murdered your father.
Come in.
Uh, who is it?
Inspector holt.
Oh, I remember.
What is it this time, more braille?
No.
Tell me what you know about Dr. orloff.
Dr. orloff, as I knew him, he was one of the kindest men I ever met.
He was our most generous supporter.
Oh, no, he wasn't.
He used you.
He gave money to your institute in order to get the blind men here as dupes.
Mr. holt!
I shall like to see this hospital of his.
I will take you there.
You didn't say anything about Jake, did you?
No.
Don't.
Holt wants to keep him on the sidelines.
One of our inmates is a patient in the hospital at the moment.
We shouldn't disturb him any more than we can help.
I'm investigating a murder case, Mr. dearborn.
Yes, I understand that.
This is the man, Lou.
What's the matter with him?
Some nerve trouble.
There's a gentleman here to see you, Lou, a police inspector.
He wants to speak to you.
Lou.
Lou.
Lou!
Is he deaf as well as dumb and blind?
No, no, he should be able to hear quite well.
Who fitted this place up?
Dr. orloff.
One of his many charities.
Well, what's this?
You have me at a disadvantage, inspector.
I'm not familiar with any object unless I handle it myself.
It's an iron tank.
You can run water into it.
What's it for?
I'm afraid only Dr.
Orloff could tell you that.
I have no medical knowledge.
Lou.
Lou!
What's the matter, Lou?
I'll send along a doctor to see if he can do the man any good.
Oh, by the way, have you got a machine here for the writing of braille?
Oh, yes, inspector.
I want the man Lou to answer some questions.
If the poor devil can't see, hear, or speak, he can still feel.
So if you will have these transcribed into braille, then he can write down the answers.
Miss Stuart and one of the men can do it right away.
I'll be seeing you later, Mr. dearborn.
You ready, O'Reilly?
Goodbye, inspector.
I'm pleased we can be of assistance.
Thank you.
Miss Stuart?
- Yes.
- Oh.
Here is a list of questions to be transcribed into braille.
You can read it out and one of the men will take it down on the stainsby machine.
The machine is kept in the cupboard by the window.
This is the key.
Mr. dearborn sent me.
Yes, for the braille.
I was just getting out the machine.
There.
Thank you.
Just a minute.
I want you to hurry, men.
Faster, faster.
At what time did he perform the operation?
Who is it?
Henry Stuart's daughter.
What is it, my dear?
This belonged to my father.
How did it get into this house?
I don't recollect ever seeing it before.
Seeing it?
How could you see it, Mr. dearborn?
Blind.
You're no more blind than I am.
You're a fake!
And you're shielding the man who killed my father.
Since you are so interested, I'll tell you.
Yes, I am the man who disposed of your father.
And for the same reasons
I must now dispose of that poor fool on the bed.
Both got in my way.
No one can hear you!
Please get off!
Please don't.
Let me go!
Inspector holt knows that I'm...
That stupid policeman.
He stood there and asked me what the tank was used for.
Now I will show you.
What you going to do?
You'll see.
Oh, please don't!
Don't!
Don't!
No!
Now.
This building was once a warehouse and the floor we're on now overhangs the river.
Below there are mud flats which have proved most useful.
Eventually, the tide releases them the rest you will understand.
In your father's case, unfortunately, we couldn't follow this procedure.
Jake carried him to the river.
Listen, orloff, I'm to meet holt at 6:00.
If I am missing he'll come straight here.
My dear young woman, I shall soon be sailing down the river.
I have my own yacht.
They'll know.
The men downstairs know nothing, they are blind.
Who else will be alive to tell them?
Jake!
River police emergency call.
Report inspector holt.
Dropped anchor off the dearborn home.
River police calling inspector holt.
Craft anchored off the dearborn home.
Right.
Hey, what is this?
We've scared him into action.
Make no mistake this time, Jake.
Goodbye, miss Stuart.
Don't, Jake, please!
Don't, listen to me, Jake!
Listen to me!
Hurry, men, hurry.
Don't!
Don't, Jake, don't!
Please, Jake, don't!
Jake!
Where's Lou, Jake?
Lou?
He's gone, Jake.
Orloff got rid of him like he got rid of all the others, out of this window into the river.
Lou!
Lou!
What's the matter?
Stay where you are.
Get on with your work.
Lou!
Lou!
Lou!
Jake!
What are you waiting for?
Do as I've told you.
You killed Lou!
I shall have to settle with you myself.
Holden put a cord around the house, O'Reilly get the door.
Come on, search the place!
All right, keep calm, keep calm.
Get that man some help!
Alright, come on!
Go back!
I'm orloff!
You'll get half the money!
Thank god you're safe!
I hope that guy has sense enough to look for my cigar case.
Has he gone?
When a dog goes mad, he has to be destroyed.
Goodbye, kid.
Goodbye.
Bye.
Oh, yeah, I can see that's the routine, alright.
Put me down for a couple of bucks for the wedding present.
Hello, morality.
Okay, I'll go quietly.
Quietly back to Chicago for a rest cure.
