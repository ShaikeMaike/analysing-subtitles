{2496}{2551}Now listen, friend.
{2553}{2615}The railroad's gonna come|right smack through your land...
{2618}{2691}and there ain't a thing in the world|that you can do to stop it.
{2693}{2798}But, mister, a dollar a acre?|Why, I paid $15 a acre for it.
{2800}{2873}And then there's my home|and the barn and the crop.
{2876}{2923}Well, take it|or leave it, friend.
{2925}{3007}But if you won't sell,|all we gotta do is call in the government.
{3010}{3082}They'll confiscate your land,|and then you won't get nothin'.
{3085}{3142}But if that's the way|you want it.
{3205}{3283}- What'll I do?|- I don't know.
{3285}{3355}- Mister! Mister!|- Here he comes.
{3358}{3425}- Mister!|- Well?
{3428}{3515}I reckon if that's the way|they're gonna do it-
{3517}{3614}Now you're talkin' sense.|Can you write?
{3617}{3680}- No, sir.|- Here.
{3683}{3749}Put your mark right there.
{3853}{3906}I'm telling you like a friend, lady.
{3908}{3965}If you won't sell,|the government will take it from you.
{3968}{4045}You can save yourself a lot|of trouble by just signing now.
{4048}{4134}It's- It's so little-|two dollars a acre.
{4137}{4235}But... well,|if that's the way-
{4237}{4293}Don't sign it, Ma.|Please don't.
{4296}{4369}- Let's see a lawyer first.|- Oh, you're wasting your time.
{4371}{4469}Let's see one anyway, Ma. We can go to town|this evening and see Judge Harvey.
{4472}{4550}- He'll tell you what to do.|Wait till you see him, please.|- Oh, what's the use? Right here.
{4553}{4670}- Oh, please, Ma!|- Well, I suppose it can't hurt|to talk to somebody first.
{4673}{4761}You don't mind waitin'|till tomorrow, do ya?
{4764}{4858}Well, it won't do you any good,|but whatever you say, ma'am.
{4930}{4995}No hard feelings, son.
{4998}{5046}Why, no, sir.
{5081}{5143}Trying to hold us up, huh?
{5146}{5236}- Leave him alone!|- Tryin' to jack up the price, are ya?
{5239}{5321}No, no, please! Leave him alone!|Don't hurt him! I'll sign!
{5324}{5390}- I will right now.|- Don't sign it, Ma!
{5393}{5446}- I will.|- My arm. Please let go.
{5448}{5505}- Right there, ma'am.|- Ma!
{5672}{5721}Whoa.
{5724}{5772}Howdy, bud.
{5857}{5929}- Sir?|- I just said howdy.
{5932}{5995}Oh. Howdy.
{5997}{6093}- What's your name?|- James. Jesse James.
{6095}{6161}Do you own this farm?
{6164}{6214}No, but my ma does.
{6217}{6271}- Where is she?|- Up at the house.
{6274}{6327}Thanks, bud.
{6695}{6796}Whoa.
{6909}{6966}Mornin'.
{7008}{7074}Oh, good mornin', ma'am.
{7145}{7198}Are you the lady|that owns this farm?
{7201}{7261}- Yes, I am.|- My name's Barshee.
{7263}{7346}I'm with the railroad. Now, we're comin'|through this way, you know?
{7348}{7396}Yes, I heard so.
{7398}{7448}I wanna get this deed|signed up.
{7451}{7506}Now, if you'll just put|your name right there.
{7509}{7571}- For nothing?|- No, no.
{7574}{7632}We're payin' a dollar an acre,|just like everybody else.
{7634}{7703}That's the law. Everybody's gettin'|the same thing-dollar an acre.
{7705}{7756}Seems mighty little, don't it?
{7758}{7831}I can't help that, lady, but|that's all you're gonna get.
{7834}{7926}- So you might as well sign up now as later.|- You mean right this minute?
{7929}{8022}Now look, lady.|We ain't got all day to hang around here.
{8024}{8105}Now, you either take what I'm offering|everybody else, or you'll get nothin'.
{8107}{8158}We'll get your land just the same.
{8161}{8263}I wouldn't dream of signing a thing like that|till I talk to some lawyer about it.
{8265}{8348}Are you gonna waste my time|with some jackleg lawyer?
{8351}{8412}Your land ain't any different|than anybody else's.
{8414}{8510}Well, there's no use talkin'.|I'm not gonna sign that thing right now.
{8513}{8591}Now look, lady.|I don't wanna have any trouble with you.
{8593}{8683}Didn't you hear her say no?|She said she wasn't gonna sign.
{8687}{8763}- Who are you?|- That's my son, Frank.
{8765}{8862}Ah, well, if you're so smart,|how'd you like...
{8865}{8942}for the government to condemn this land|and take it for nothin'?
{8945}{9022}- Wouldn't like it.|- Then you better understand...
{9024}{9096}that I'm doin' you folks a favor|when I offer you a dollar an acre.
{9099}{9150}I don't want no favors.
{9152}{9215}Well, maybe you'd like|to go to court about it.
{9218}{9278}I might at that.
{9280}{9344}Well, you folks|have it your own way.
{9347}{9484}All right, son. No hard feelings.
{9486}{9552}Frank!
{9554}{9625}Kinda tricky, ain't ya?
{9658}{9708}Yeah.
{9761}{9824}- Get him, boys.|- Frank! Frank!
{9827}{9908}I ain't a-scared.
{9910}{9965}Ya ain't gonna all|jump on him, are ya?
{10074}{10167}Back against the wall, you fellas.|Keep your hands out of your pockets.
{10170}{10227}- Wanna fight him, Frank?|- Please, Frank, don't.
{10229}{10286}Keep them others|from runnin' up my back.
{10288}{10342}They ain't gonna do|anything. Are ya, fellas?
{10344}{10412}- Jesse, stop him! Stop him!|- Sorry, Ma. He started it.
{10415}{10487}Oh, please, Jesse,|don't let him.
{10490}{10571}Frank!
{10741}{10815}Oh, Jesse, stop him.|Stop him!
{10970}{11026}He's gonna get hurt.
{11191}{11255}Looks to me like he's got enough.
{11298}{11350}Who's next?
{11352}{11413}Think you can lick 'em all?
{11416}{11511}I'll fight 'em or wrestle 'em if they'll|come at me and pile 'em up under the tree.
{11514}{11582}You'll do nothin' of the kind.|You men, get away from here!
{11584}{11631}Jess!
{11662}{11712}Well, if he ain't|the tricky one.
{11714}{11823}Now, get off this land.|All of you! Move along!
{11865}{11912}And jump!
{12037}{12115}But we're still gonna get|this land just the same.
{12235}{12306}Jesse!
{12308}{12355}- I'm all right, son.|- What happened?
{12358}{12421}Well, I don't know.|It went black.
{12423}{12471}- What's happened, Ma?|- She fainted.
{12473}{12546}- No, I didn't. I just gotta lay down.|- You better get Doc Hall.
{12548}{12596}Pinkie!
{12624}{12685}- Pinkie!|- Yes, sir?
{12688}{12737}Get on your mule|and go after Doc Hall.
{12740}{12773}- Tell him to hurry.|- Yes, sir.
{12775}{12810}- And, Pinkie?|- Yes, sir?
{12813}{12846}After you get him started...
{12848}{12895}get to all the farmers|this side of Liberty-
{12898}{12951}Mr. Crump, Mr. Clayton,|Mr. Thompson, all of them.
{12954}{13007}Tell 'em we're gonna have an|important meeting here tonight.
{13010}{13059}Tell 'em to come as soon|as they knock off work.
{13062}{13109}Yes, sir.
{13216}{13283}And furthermore...
{13315}{13396}if the St. Louis Midland...
{13398}{13491}don't know|the way its agents...
{13494}{13566}are swindlin' the farmers...
{13568}{13662}it's high time|they found out.
{13663}{13731}Uh, comma.
{13733}{13800}Because it's|the goldangedest...
{13802}{13884}dag-blastedest,|"consangulest" outrage...
{13886}{13961}ever perpetrated|on a law-abiding citizenry...
{13964}{14030}in the whole history|of the world.
{14033}{14080}Paragraph.
{14083}{14142}Uh-oh.
{14290}{14356}Trouble, by gravy.
{14358}{14406}- Uncle Rufe.|- Huh?
{14409}{14461}You want me to take those|cuss words out, don't you?
{14463}{14511}Oh, I guess so.
{14639}{14708}You mean you want to swear out|warrants for their arrest?
{14710}{14800}I'm charging both Frank and Jesse James|with assault with attempt to murder.
{14802}{14850}- Too bad they didn't finish it.|- Jesse?
{14853}{14912}Yes. While my back|was turned.
{14914}{14988}Nice shootin'.
{14990}{15085}If you'll swear in me and my men as deputies,|we won't bother you anymore.
{15087}{15165}We'll bring in these|buckaroos ourselves, tonight.
{15227}{15276}It's Jesse.|He's in trouble.
{15278}{15352}No! What did he do?|Uncle Rufe!
{15355}{15460}You know them cuss words|I told you to take out? Put 'em back in!
{15527}{15607}Uncle Rufe! Uncle Rufe!
{15610}{15702}What we gotta do is chip in some money,|whatever we can afford...
{15704}{15770}and send down to St. Louis|for a lawyer.
{15772}{15837}We bought our land, built|out homes and raised our crops.
{15839}{15912}If we have to give 'em up,|we got a right to a fair price.
{15914}{15962}- You're right.|- I'm glad somebody done something.
{15964}{16036}- We don't want any trouble, Jesse.|- Not unless they start it, Ma.
{16039}{16087}What we need is somebody|that knows the law...
{16089}{16137}to tell us our rights|and how to protect 'em.
{16139}{16200}- Jesse's right. We need a lawyer.|- Jesse! Frank!
{16203}{16288}Jesse! Frank!
{16329}{16411}Jesse! Frank! You boys|gotta get outta here.
{16414}{16497}They already got a warrant for you,|and they're headed here now.
{16499}{16576}So you gotta skip out, both of you.|I told Pinkie to get your horses ready.
{16579}{16638}- Ain't nobody gonna arrest me.|- I ain't gonna run.
{16641}{16708}- Now, listen, Jesse!|- Oh, listen to the major, Frank.
{16710}{16775}Don't you understand|you ain't got a chance?
{16778}{16835}The St. Louis Midland's|got this whole state hog-tied.
{16837}{16893}They got the police. They got the courts.|They got everything.
{16895}{16943}A trial right now would be a joke.
{16946}{17024}The railroad's got too much at stake|to let two farmer boys bollix things up.
{17026}{17081}- We got a right to defend ourselves.|- Jesse!
{17083}{17147}- Well, sure, Ma.|- Do what the major says. He's right.
{17150}{17255}All you gotta do is hide out till I can get|the governor to give you a fair trial.
{17257}{17334}- But if we run away-|- Jesse, please go like the major says.
{17337}{17395}If you don't, it'll mean trouble.|I know it will.
{17397}{17445}I couldn't stand it.|I'm not well enough.
{17447}{17495}- Massa Frank.|- Please go.
{17498}{17560}The horses are ready|at the back gate.
{17563}{17635}All right, Ma, if it'll|make you feel any better.
{17638}{17692}Oh, be awful careful, Son.
{17694}{17761}- Don't worry, Ma.|- Take care of him, Frank.
{17763}{17846}- Yes, Ma.|- Bye, Jesse.
{17849}{17921}- Good-bye, Ma.|- Major, Pinkie'll know where we are.
{17998}{18046}Pinkie.
{18048}{18122}Yes, sir.|I knows where it is.
{18125}{18216}Be careful, boys.|Be careful.
{18593}{18687}- Now, ladies, you all go|down the road a piece and wait.
{18690}{18767}There's apt to be a fracas here,|and just let us men handle it.
{18770}{18837}Go on. Step along now.|Just get right down there.
{18919}{19012}Now, men, listen to me.|Let me do all the talkin'.
{19014}{19062}Yes, Major.
{19065}{19137}Here they come.
{19291}{19339}Evenin', gentlemen.
{19341}{19407}- Where's the James boys?|- We got a warrant for them, Major.
{19409}{19496}They ain't here. They're gone. And if you|wanna know who got 'em away, 'twas me.
{19499}{19560}- Easy, Major.|- Get outta the way!
{19563}{19655}Just a minute, Mr. Barshee.|You have my word for it. The boys are gone.
{19658}{19712}Your word.
{19715}{19772}Come out,|Frank and Jesse James!
{19775}{19830}Come out, or we'll come in|and pull you out!
{19833}{19928}Their mother's that sick in bed,|and her heart won't stand you|stompin' through the house.
{19931}{19987}Are you gonna let this old goat|make a fool out of you?
{19990}{20036}- He says they ain't there.|- They ain't!
{20039}{20142}Well, I got a way to find that out.|Lynch, bring me that mush melon.
{20145}{20212}- Major!|- The major's tellin' the truth.
{20214}{20302}If you ain't outta there in one minute,|I'm gonna blow you out.
{20305}{20383}- You think I'm lyin'?|- Major! Major!
{20386}{20458}They can come in!|Let 'em!
{20531}{20618}- Look! There's somebody|in there! What'd I tell you?|- It's the mother, I tell ya!
{21088}{21172}There's no use. She's dead.
{21174}{21266}This is bad. Mighty bad.
{21269}{21324}I'm sure sorry.
{21357}{21415}Well, I'm sorry too.
{21417}{21522}Oh, I wasn't talkin'|about her. She's gone.
{21525}{21593}It's you I'm sorry for.
{21835}{21886}Whoa. Whoa.
{22069}{22117}Zee!
{22120}{22167}Frank.
{22169}{22218}- Frank!|- Yeah?
{22221}{22290}- It's Zee!|- Zee?
{22380}{22439}- I couldn't hardly believe my eyes.|- Zee!
{22442}{22511}- Frank.|- How are you, Zee?
{22514}{22577}I've worried so|about y'all.
{22579}{22627}- About us?|- How's everybody?
{22630}{22683}How's everything|at home? How's Ma?
{22684}{22764}- Jesse.|- Ma?
{22766}{22848}- What happened?|- Barshee-
{22934}{22982}You mean she's dead?
{23066}{23117}Oh, Jesse.
{23215}{23291}Well, let's go.
{23377}{23426}Bye, honey.
{23429}{23476}Oh, Jesse, don't you go.
{23479}{23541}- I've got to.|- Oh, no, Jesse! Please!
{23543}{23600}I can't help it, Zee.|I've just got to.
{23602}{23672}- Let Frank.|- Sorry, honey.
{23674}{23763}- Frank, make him!|- Take care of her.
{23765}{23852}- What about me?|- I'm the one he did it to, 'cause I shot him.
{23855}{23923}Go ahead. If you|don't get him, I will.
{23925}{23982}It might be a long time|before I see you again, Zee.
{23985}{24036}- I can wait.|- Bye, honey.
{24039}{24086}Bye, Jesse.
{24630}{24710}Just keep anybody|from bothering me. That's all.
{25128}{25182}Keep your hands in sight.
{25185}{25271}Bartender,|count three and duck.
{25274}{25334}- Yes, sir.|- Now, wait a minute, Jesse.
{25337}{25385}It was an accident.|I swear it was.
{25388}{25451}- Count.|- No, no. I can explain it.
{25453}{25510}I didn't know she was there.|I swear it.
{25512}{25578}Keep your hands|in sight. One!
{25580}{25647}- No. No! Jesse!|- Two.
{27117}{27183}Now, stand still.
{27185}{27276}One, two, three,|four, five.
{27277}{27343}- Thank you, gentlemen.|- All aboard!
{27345}{27402}Thank you, Mayor.
{27405}{27495}All aboard!
{30367}{30438}Hands up!
{30440}{30518}Keep right on driving|until I tell you to stop.
{30520}{30567}What you aimin'|to do, partner?
{30570}{30671}I ain't aimin' to do nothin'.|I'm doin' it. I'm holding up this train.
{30673}{30756}- The whole train?|- Slack up at this next curve.
{30759}{30841}Stop her just this side of that|clump of trees around the bend.
{30893}{30946}It's your funeral, partner.
{31565}{31642}Unhitch it!
{31644}{31722}If you don't know what this is,|folks, it's a holdup.
{31725}{31798}Stay in your seats! Keep your hands in sight.
{31800}{31860}The gent who just throwed his|pocketbook in the spittoon...
{31862}{31931}will kindly take it out and wipe it clean|before we get to him.
{31933}{32007}- No jewelry, folks. Just cash.|- That's every cent I've got in the world.
{32010}{32081}This'll teach you not to ride on the|St. Louis Midland Railroad. Thank you, sir.
{32084}{32142}No, ma'am. No jewelry.|Thank you just the same.
{32145}{32216}That's very nice of you, sir.|That's a fine-lookin' pocketbook.
{32219}{32310}Thank you very much, lady. Don't forget|to sue the railroad for everything you give us.
{32313}{32377}It's responsible.|Thank you very kindly, sir.
{32380}{32466}Just drop it in the sack,|and nobody'll get hurt. Thank you, brother.
{32469}{32543}Have your wallets ready|by the time the gentleman gets to you.
{32545}{32616}- Don't take all day. Thank you, brother.|- Sit down.
{32618}{32676}Thank you, sir.|Thank you kindly.
{32679}{32770}You'll hear about this!
{32772}{32855}No back talk. Thank you, brother.|Thank you, brother.
{32921}{33021}Everybody sit quiet, and nobody'll get hurt.
{33024}{33078}All right. Let's go. Lights out.
{33703}{33798}And then he stuck a pistol|as big as a cannon right there and says...
{33800}{33861}"Brother, we want that mail safe."
{33864}{33954}Where was the protection|we're entitled to? Where was the law?
{33956}{34012}Just a minute, cap.|I'm just the law in Liberty.
{34015}{34103}I don't cover the whole United States.|If you wanna give me a description of these men-
{34106}{34188}You know as well as I do|who it was. Jesse James!
{34190}{34278}Who else picks on my road?|Who else would have the nerve?
{34281}{34350}Sure, it was. But you don't|have to yell about it.
{34353}{34400}I'm not deaf.
{34769}{34832}What's that?
{34904}{34973}Look! It's him!
{35139}{35221}- Well, you crazy son of a gun.|- How are you, Major?
{35224}{35276}Oh, Jesse, you're just|asking to be caught.
{35279}{35366}- Don't you know they're looking|all over the county for you?|- Sure. How about a cup of coffee?
{35369}{35439}The marshall's got 30 men|out lookin' for you, son.
{35441}{35507}In all this rain too. Tsk, tsk. Poor boys.
{35510}{35582}- It's no joke, Jesse.|- Oh, it's all right, honey.|I ain't gonna stay long.
{35584}{35656}The way I figure it out,|as long as they keep runnin' around out there...
{35659}{35711}in here is the safest|place for me.
{35713}{35799}- Go on. Set down. Leave the man alone.|- But he's taking chances!
{35802}{35900}If I could just think of some way|to let you know how wrong you are.
{35902}{35975}It's no use, honey.|It's just like I always told you.
{35978}{36055}I hate the railroads. When I hate,|I've gotta do something about it.
{36057}{36122}- That's the stuff.|- Can I get you anything?
{36124}{36188}People ain't hatin' like they used to.|They're gettin' soft.
{36191}{36286}I've got to admit that I like a man|that hauls off and hates good and hard.
{36289}{36366}It's the lawyers are|messin' up the whole world.
{36369}{36462}Ten years ago here in Liberty,|we didn't have no lawyers and got along fine.
{36465}{36530}A man killed somebody,|then somebody killed him.
{36533}{36596}The marshall shot 'em all,|and that was the end of it.
{36599}{36686}But look at it today. Right here in Liberty,|we got hundreds of lawyers-
{36689}{36759}thousands of' em-as far as the eye can see,|nothin' but lawyers.
{36761}{36836}Uncle Rufe, there are|only two lawyers in Liberty.
{36838}{36931}Huh? Two? Is that all?|Then they run around too much.
{36933}{37020}Goldang it, I'm gonna write me|an editorial about that.
{37022}{37070}- Roy!|- Yes, sir?
{37072}{37142}Take an editorial|on lawyers.
{37144}{37262}- "Liars"?|- That'll do. We'll begin easy.
{37264}{37311}Paragraph.
{37314}{37442}If we are ever to have|law and order in the West...
{37445}{37571}the first thing we gotta do|is take out all the lawyers...
{37574}{37658}and shoot 'em down|like dogs.
{37714}{37753}Paragraph.
{37755}{37822}They're bound to get you|someday, Jesse.
{37995}{38111}That's why I hate to see you|go out that door-
{38114}{38212}because I keep thinking of you|all the time out there in the hills...
{38215}{38290}just going on and on|to nowhere...
{38293}{38372}just trying to keep alive.
{38374}{38486}And everybody after you,|wanting to kill you to get that money.
{38488}{38637}And, Jesse, sometimes at night|when it's cold and rainy...
{38639}{38711}I wake up crying...
{38712}{38785}because in a dream I saw you|lying dead in the mud.
{38822}{38884}Oh, Jesse, I'm so scared.
{38994}{39101}You're the only one that it matters to,|Zee, one way or the other.
{39103}{39168}You're the only one|that means anything to me.
{39205}{39299}I know it was a fool thing|to come here, but...
{39302}{39383}I never knew how much|I did want to see you...
{39386}{39433}until I saw you.
{39589}{39684}The dag-blamedest|outrage ever-
{39686}{39760}- Hi, Horace Greeley.|- Oh, hello, Will.
{39837}{39903}- I thought you was-|- I was.
{39906}{39963}Is, uh, Zee inside?
{39965}{40013}Well, she's-
{40015}{40093}- Evenin', Zee.|- Evening, Will. I thought|you went out with the posse.
{40094}{40156}I did. I just got back.
{40159}{40212}Did you catch him?
{40308}{40371}Uh, this is|Mr. Howard, Will.
{40374}{40438}Mr. Thomas Howard,|an old friend of ours.
{40441}{40492}This is a United States|Marshall, Mr. Wright.
{40494}{40548}- How do you do, Mr. Howard?|- How do you do?
{40551}{40620}- Uh, Mr. Howard's from St. Louis.|- Yes?
{40622}{40674}I used to live|in St. Louis.
{40677}{40752}Uh, what business|are you in, Mr. Howard?
{40755}{40834}Guns.|Guns and horses.
{40837}{40934}Guns and horses, eh?|No, we didn't catch him.
{40937}{41010}You couldn't find a white|elephant on a night like this.
{41013}{41073}Zee used to know Jesse James.|Did she ever tell you?
{41075}{41172}They kinda grew up together. She's told me|so much, I almost feel I know him myself.
{41175}{41252}- You do?|- Good biscuits. You make 'em, Zee?
{41254}{41303}Uh, uh-huh.
{41306}{41365}Try one, Mr. Howard.
{41462}{41526}I don't mean that we|ain't after him, understand.
{41528}{41600}I'm still a peace officer.|If we ever come on each other...
{41603}{41681}in the right place, it's just gonna be|me or him, one or the other.
{41684}{41759}Yes, I, uh- I understand.
{41762}{41881}What I'm hoping is, either he'll|stop messing around my district|or else keep out of my way.
{41884}{41963}'Cause it'll save Zee|some hurt either way.
{41966}{42021}You know your job, I guess.
{42024}{42071}I know it,|and I'm good at it.
{42074}{42133}I'm just as good at my job|as he is at his.
{42135}{42232}That's why next time, I'm either gonna blow|his head off, or he's gonna blow mine.
{42235}{42292}I, uh, got a little business|up the road a piece.
{42295}{42363}Take me about an hour. Maybe I'll|drop in again later if your light's on.
{42366}{42414}- All right, Will.|- Good night, Horace Greeley.
{42415}{42487}Uh, huh?|Oh, good night, Will.
{42490}{42593}I, uh, don't expect|I'll be seeing you again.
{42596}{42679}No, I don't expect so.
{42682}{42731}Take care of yourself.
{42947}{43032}You got a better grade|of law than it used to be.
{43035}{43101}Don't waste time, Jesse.|Go now.
{43146}{43197}I think I'd better|go that way.
{43270}{43343}Will you blow out that light?|I don't want to be a target.
{43346}{43408}Yes.
{43570}{43617}Zee.
{44098}{44157}Is that why|you won't marry me?
{44215}{44271}I can't help it, Will.
{44515}{44597}Well, let's load him on a horse|and take him to town.
{44970}{45052}Hey, one of you fellas|come here and give me a hand.
{45054}{45124}Get outta the way, you young 'uns.|This ain't no place for you.
{45127}{45179}Get over on the other side.
{45181}{45241}- Is... that-|- No, ma'am.
{45243}{45314}We didn't get the jackpot this time.
{45316}{45366}They keep on|running up that price...
{45369}{45429}one of Jesse's own men's|liable to take a shot at him.
{45432}{45507}Yeah. Some of them fellas|would scalp their own ma...
{45509}{45564}for a lot less than $5,000.
{45625}{45683}Let him down on this side.
{45924}{45984}Are you really as pretty|as I think you are?
{45987}{46061}Oh, Jesse, read this.|Read it!
{46138}{46201}Will arranged it.|I asked him to.
{46235}{46301}- I can't do that, Zee.|- Why not?
{46304}{46399}L- I trust Will, but-
{46402}{46508}He's given his word. He's promised.|He'll see that it works out all right.
{46511}{46586}Jesse, listen. It isn't only now...
{46588}{46637}although that's bad enough.
{46640}{46702}It's what's going|to happen to you.
{46704}{46792}Inside of you.|You understand?
{46795}{46862}I mean, right now|you're a hero...
{46864}{46937}to yourself and a lot|of other people too.
{46939}{47028}It's a fight you're in,|and it's the railroad that started it.
{47031}{47107}But that's not gonna last, Jesse.
{47109}{47181}The more luck you have,|the worse you'll get.
{47184}{47253}Shooting and robbing.|It'll get in your blood, Jesse.
{47255}{47369}You'll get like a wolf,|just doing it because it's your nature.
{47371}{47462}It'll be your appetite|for shooting and robbing...
{47498}{47577}until something happens to you.
{47580}{47658}And if anything ever|happened to you, Jesse...
{47660}{47731}it'd be like it was|happening to me too.
{47770}{47848}Oh, darling,|there's only one way out.
{47851}{47937}Come in. Give up.
{47939}{48016}Let me draw a free breath again.
{48190}{48294}I can't, Zee. I'd go crazy in prison.
{48335}{48410}L- I couldn't do it.
{48412}{48473}But if we went away now-
{48476}{48541}That's all there is to it, Jesse.
{48599}{48647}Good-bye.
{48649}{48711}- But, Zee, please!|- Good luck.
{48996}{49056}Zee, you said you'd wait.
{49058}{49106}However long it took.
{49108}{49168}Well, would you|marry me now, before?
{49171}{49233}Today, if you want me to.
{49235}{49293}Then that's the way, I guess.
{49295}{49343}The only way.
{50237}{50337}And then the Prodigal Son...
{50340}{50418}come home to his ma and pa.
{50491}{50561}Welcome, brothers and sister.
{50564}{50611}Thank you, sir.
{50614}{50671}Sit down.
{50674}{50734}Just find a seat anywhere.
{50782}{50831}Could, uh, we get hitched?
{50944}{51004}- Huh?|- Uh, married.
{51007}{51065}You ain't eloping, are you?
{51068}{51124}- How's that?|- Oh, no, sir. I'm grown.
{51127}{51183}We're in a kinda hurry,|if you don't mind.
{51186}{51244}- Oh, uh, your brothers?|- I have no brothers.
{51246}{51328}- Sorry. What's your name, sister?|- Zerelda Cobb.
{51331}{51389}- And yours, son?|- Jesse Woodson James.
{51390}{51484}Jesse Wood-|Jesse James!
{51486}{51522}- Thank the Lord!|- Sit down.
{51524}{51580}Yes, sir, and we don't|want no trouble.
{51582}{51633}Trouble? Why, son...
{51635}{51730}you're as welcome|as rain to the flowers.
{51732}{51854}Do you realize, boy, that I had a farm|giving 900 bushels of corn...
{51857}{51928}until that railroad|had taken it from me?
{51929}{52052}Why, I'd given up preaching and was|making an honest living off the land...
{52054}{52179}until that dag-swinged railroad|swindled me out of my own home.
{52182}{52272}- Us too, Mr. James.|- By golly, son...
{52275}{52344}do you know|I had a big house...
{52346}{52421}two barns,|three outhouses...
{52423}{52541}until that goldanged|railroad "honswoggled" me?
{52543}{52598}Amen. Amen.
{52600}{52676}All right.|We're gathered here...
{52678}{52772}to join Zerelda Cobb|and Jesse Woodson James...
{52773}{52825}in the bonds|of holy matrimony.
{53010}{53086}- Howdy, Jesse.|- Howdy, Will.
{53089}{53169}I, uh, guess Zee|explained things.
{53171}{53240}She said they're|willing to go light.
{53241}{53313}From the way they talk,|they're so glad to get rid of you...
{53316}{53383}they're liable to make you|a conductor on the road.
{53385}{53439}- What do you think I'll get?|- Two, three years.
{53442}{53513}Maybe five. It won't be much.|All they're charging you with...
{53516}{53600}is that little old depot at Pine Hills|that you knocked over last April.
{53603}{53674}That one they got proof on.
{53676}{53743}I'm much obliged|for all you've done.
{53746}{53793}Don't mention it.
{53840}{53888}Shall we go?
{54335}{54423}Is it all right, Jesse?
{54426}{54473}Jesse!
{54826}{54896}- Howdy, Jesse.|- Howdy.
{54899}{54984}- Howdy, Jesse.|- Judge. Major.
{54987}{55034}Jesse.
{55084}{55138}You ain't got no more guns|on you, have you?
{55140}{55188}- No.|- All right.
{55190}{55243}- You're doing the wise thing, son.|- Am I?
{55246}{55334}Judge Mathews here is gonna try your|case, son. You can trust him, all right.
{55336}{55392}I'm aiming to go as light|as the law allows.
{55395}{55448}When you come out,|the slate will be clean.
{55450}{55512}- The past will all be forgotten.|- Thank you, Judge.
{55514}{55594}- Well, Jesse, if you're ready.|- Well, I-
{55653}{55714}All right, Jesse. Go ahead.
{55868}{55933}You ain't worried,|are you, kid?
{55936}{55993}- I could do it on my head.|- Good boy.
{56166}{56243}Oh, my darling. My wife.
{56246}{56293}My husband.
{56382}{56479}Oh, I'm proud of you, dear.|Proud of you.
{56535}{56603}Bye, Zee. Good-bye.
{56786}{56833}I'll be waiting.
{57698}{57759}Yes, sir.|You can go right in.
{57840}{57932}- Mr. James?|- Oh.
{57935}{58001}I'm Mr. McCoy,|president of the railroad.
{58003}{58060}Ah, yes. I know|who you are, Mr. McCoy.
{58063}{58159}I just want to welcome you and tell you|how glad I am to see you here in jail.
{59022}{59096}- From this point-|- What's all this soldier business?
{59098}{59157}Oh, this is Mr. Wright,|peace officer here.
{59160}{59225}- Mr. Clarke, the state prosecutor.|- How do you do? Well?
{59228}{59294}Well, we're gonna try to hang|our lawless friend, of course.
{59296}{59348}Before or after the trial?
{59351}{59439}- Well, the penalty for murder is death.|- That wasn't the idea.
{59441}{59513}- The idea?|- That wasn't the idea you|gave me, James or the girl.
{59516}{59610}Now get this straight, Wright.|When you're dealing with|a criminal, anything goes-
{59613}{59661}anything that'll trap him.
{59662}{59714}James is a thief|and a murderer...
{59716}{59781}the most notorious bandit|and outlaw in America.
{59783}{59898}He has burned my property, robbed my trains|and scared people out of riding in my cars.
{59900}{59977}Three years ago,|I swore he'd hang for what he done...
{59980}{60057}and by the Almighty|he is going to hang.
{60059}{60115}That still ain't the way|things are done around here.
{60118}{60188}- You're a peace officer, aren't you?|- But not a skunk.
{60191}{60270}- Did you explain all this to Judge Mathews?|- It won't be necessary, my boy.
{60271}{60327}He's been superseded|by Judge Rankin of St. Louis...
{60330}{60413}who's not so sentimental|about train robbers.
{60415}{60482}He arrives tonight.|The trial's tomorrow morning.
{60485}{60581}- Anything else?|- A nice frame, eh?
{60583}{60637}And while we're|about it, Marshall...
{60641}{60729}it might be better for you if you dropped|this role of attorney for the defense...
{60732}{60780}and confined yourself|to the duties of your office.
{60782}{60873}- Who, me?|- Any interference on your part-
{60876}{60946}- It ain't me you gotta worry about.|- What do you mean?
{60949}{61020}Suppose Jesse|don't wanna be hanged.
{61199}{61258}Roy, stop the press.
{61260}{61318}Take a new editorial|on railroad presidents.
{61321}{61383}- Yes, sir.|- Paragraph.
{61386}{61498}If we are ever to have law|and order in the West...
{61500}{61624}the first thing we gotta do|is take out all the railroad presidents...
{61626}{61677}and shoot 'em down like dogs.
{61680}{61728}- Paragraph.|- Where's Zee?
{61731}{61798}- Where've you been?|- Up to Pine Ridge. Where's Zee?
{61800}{61848}- Zee? She's out.|- Out where?
{61851}{61937}Well, she set out-
{61939}{62012}I wouldn't want this to go|any further, you understand?
{62015}{62094}- I understand.|- Well, she set out for the hills.
{62097}{62162}- Alone?|- Not exactly alone.
{62165}{62287}She was being guided by a darky|named Pinkie on a mule named Stinky.
{62290}{62337}I see.
{62384}{62408}Whoa.
{62409}{62431}Whoa.
{62629}{62706}- Halt! Who goes there?|- It's me- Pinkie.
{62708}{62764}All right, Pinkie.|What do you want?
{62767}{62848}- I got a letter here for Mr. McCoy.|- Give me.
{62851}{62919}- A letter for Mr. McCoy!|- Is you sure he'll get it, sir?
{62922}{62968}- He'll get it.|- Yes, sir.
{62971}{63046}- For Mr. McCoy.|- Mr. McCoy.
{63049}{63096}For Mr. McCoy.
{63099}{63175}We want the trial to get started|as early as possible.
{63270}{63352}Judge, read this.
{63507}{63569}Listen.
{63572}{63669}"Mr. McCoy, if Jesse ain't|out of jail by midnight...
{63671}{63745}I'm a-comin' in and get him.|Frank James."
{63807}{63863}Well, that gives us|an hour and a half.
{63865}{63933}The nerve of him!
{63966}{64014}What ails you?
{64016}{64064}- It's this note.|- What about it?
{64066}{64137}I don't know if you gents|know it or not, but, well...
{64140}{64189}both these James boys|does things.
{64192}{64278}- What are you driving at?|- I've known Frank James a long time.
{64279}{64373}When he says he aims to do somethin',|he's liable to come good near doin' it.
{64375}{64428}Now, what on earth|do you think he can do?
{64431}{64495}He says he's gonna take|Jesse outta here.
{64497}{64568}I wish he'd try it.|We'd grab him too.
{64571}{64629}Of course we would.|You're crazy.
{64631}{64695}He's a mighty set man,|Frank is.
{64943}{64990}Hello.
{64993}{65069}Have you heard about|this ridiculous note?
{65072}{65143}- The word's got around.|- You mean everybody knows about it?
{65144}{65263}Everybody I met. They all regard it|as a very interesting situation.
{65266}{65342}Interesting?|Why, it's preposterous.
{65345}{65418}What do they think a few|ragged-pants bandits can do?
{65421}{65477}Don't they know|this is a brick jail...
{65480}{65544}surrounded and guarded|by United States soldiers?
{65547}{65626}Don't they know we could hold this jail|against an army of outlaws?
{65629}{65711}They do. That's what|makes it so interesting.
{65714}{65788}But they know, too, that both the James boys|are mighty set in their ways.
{65791}{65860}- Mighty set.|- That's what I told him.
{65862}{65946}Didn't I tell you to shut up?|How many deputies have you got?
{65948}{66040}Six on call, but I could swear in|as many more as you want.
{66043}{66090}That's it.|That's what we'll do.
{66093}{66156}We won't wait for the rascal.|We'll go out and get him.
{66159}{66233}- We could try.|- Do you think he'll really come?
{66236}{66340}- Well, don't you?|- Oh, sure. He wouldn't fool|around about a thing like this.
{66342}{66420}- He's probably on his way now.|- Well, let's not waste time.
{66422}{66488}Swear in some good men|and surround the town.
{66491}{66553}Tell them to take him|dead or alive.
{66556}{66613}Tell them to shoot first|and ask questions later.
{66615}{66694}- Tell them-|- Am I telling you how to run your railroad?
{66696}{66785}- What do you mean?|- Don't try to tell me how to take a man.
{66787}{66883}Just a minute, Marshall.|Where are you going?
{66886}{66969}- I'm going to swear in some good men.|- Wait. I'll go with you.
{66971}{67043}I'm not a bad hand|at picking men myself.
{67046}{67114}Whatever you say, cap, is|exactly what I'm going to do.
{67116}{67168}Turn out all your men.|Cover the whole town.
{67171}{67218}It's an utterly|ridiculous situation...
{67221}{67274}but by crikey I'm not|gonna take any chances.
{67276}{67320}Mighty, mighty set.
{67408}{67414}Five dollars. One-to-three he will.
{67415}{67476}Five dollars. One-to-three he will.
{67478}{67601}Ten dollars he won't.|Twelve dollars even money either way.
{67603}{67680}I've got $10, one-to-five...
{67683}{67774}that Frank James will bite|Mr. McCoy in the leg.
{67843}{67922}Bartender!
{67993}{68065}Gentlemen!|I want some deputies...
{68068}{68168}some volunteer deputies,|who've gotta be able to shoot straight|the first time... or else.
{68171}{68238}- For Frank?|- For whoever I say.
{68239}{68293}But if anybody|has got a mercenary streak...
{68296}{68385}Mr. McCoy here is talking about doubling|the pot for whoever rings the bell.
{68388}{68452}- Ten thousand dollars?|- All right, boys.
{68455}{68528}Line up at the bar|so we can get a look at you.
{68531}{68605}You and you. Ed, you're all right.|Bill, get over there.
{68608}{68693}You and you and you and you.
{68696}{68764}- Charlie, you're a good man with a gun.|- I don't like him.
{68766}{68833}- What's the matter with the big fella?|- Nothing that I know of.
{68836}{68895}- Then him.|- All right. And you.
{68898}{68973}- And these two.|- All right. You're the doctor.
{68976}{69088}All right, men. Face me,|raise your right hands and take the oath.
{69091}{69149}Up a little higher. One,|two, three, four, five, six...
{69152}{69209}seven, eight, nine,|10, 11, 12, 13-
{70252}{70306}Wild goose chase.
{70309}{70424}I don't care how many he brings.|He won't be able to get into|town, much less this building.
{70426}{70492}- The whole thing's a bluff.|- Well, it's 12:00.
{70495}{70577}- Nothing's happened-|- You!
{70580}{70669}- You-|- I couldn't help it. I'm|just nervous. That's all.
{70672}{70756}Frank said he was gonna give you|till 12:00 to let Jesse out...
{70758}{70806}and if he wasn't out by then-
{70860}{70911}- That's Jesse.|- Well, stop him!
{70914}{70974}I'll stop him,|but it won't do no good.
{70977}{71030}It's dead certain|Frank's comin' now.
{71033}{71133}And Jesse feels it.|That's the way them boys is.
{71232}{71354}No matter what happens|tonight-fire or flood-
{71356}{71471}I'm gonna have that man|fired tomorrow.
{71682}{71761}Major! Zee!|They got him!
{71763}{71834}- Frank?|- Yeah. They jumped him in the woods.
{71836}{71897}- Who? Who got him?|- Two of them deputies.
{71900}{72010}Oh, them goldanged, dag-blasted,|gol-burned deputies!
{72012}{72060}- Roy!|- Yes, sir.
{72200}{72324}Ah, I just want to thank the young men|for simplifying one of our worst problems.
{72326}{72392}Take him in there.
{72497}{72571}I sure am sorry, Frank.|Any guns on you?
{72573}{72690}- I got it.|- I sure wasn't lookin' for this. Come on, son.
{72692}{72736}Frank.
{72903}{72963}- Sorry.|- That's all right, Marshall.
{73007}{73078}You understand this ain't|any of my doing.
{73080}{73134}I just want you|and Jesse to know...
{73136}{73230}that all the honor and credit for this victory|of law and order goes to Mr. McCoy.
{73232}{73305}- We understand.|- Is that all, Marshall?
{73308}{73358}That's all. Thank you.
{73361}{73425}Get outta here.
{73428}{73485}Get out and stay out.
{73487}{73564}For a peace officer,|your attitude has been incredible...
{73566}{73664}and make no doubt it'll be reported|to the governor tomorrow.
{73667}{73738}You mean, you won't want me|anymore tonight?
{73741}{73802}Neither tonight or|any other day or night.
{73805}{73853}- Is that official?|- It is.
{73855}{73928}Sorry, Will. We didn't aim|to get you over a barrel.
{73931}{73978}Forget it, son.|The way I figure...
{73980}{74066}that barrel's gonna be mighty crowded|before this night's over.
{74069}{74122}Good night, everybody.
{74156}{74210}Good night, Marshall.
{74260}{74328}Pretty smart, aren't you?
{74330}{74401}- You ought not to have done this, Mr. McCoy.|- No?
{74404}{74508}You ought not to have tried to trick|Jesse and me when we were trustin' you.
{74511}{74597}- You ought to have kept your word.|- The way you're gonna keep yours?
{74600}{74673}- Sir?|- You said you were gonna|take Jesse out of here.
{74675}{74726}But I am.
{74830}{74902}- Hey, Jesse.|- Is that you, Frank?
{74905}{74962}It's me. You all right?
{74964}{75017}You're a cool one.
{75020}{75066}Gettin' along|just fine, Frank.
{75069}{75175}He'll be glad to see you too.
{75202}{75249}Lock the door, Tom.
{75252}{75324}- Soldiers!|- Take it easy, boys.
{75386}{75478}Now untie me.|No noise, understand?
{75553}{75669}We don't aim to kill a soul if we can help it,|but the first man that hollers-
{75672}{75757}All you gotta do is to keep your hands up|and your mouth shut.
{75760}{75814}Everything's gonna be all right.
{75817}{75889}You'll never get away|with this in the world.
{75892}{75943}I knowed it, and I told you.
{76001}{76065}Lay down.
{76145}{76207}Lay down or be shot down.
{76369}{76466}- What happened?|- Mr. McCoy was kind enough|to deputize Tom and Hank.
{76469}{76555}- On purpose?|- Guess he just didn't have any better sense.
{76665}{76714}What is this? A game?
{76716}{76774}Grown men playing|on the floor like children.
{76777}{76850}- Ain't it the truth?|- They wouldn't have it any other way.
{76984}{77033}Remember that?
{77136}{77184}Remember it?
{77187}{77284}Don't- Don't kill me.
{77287}{77385}I ain't. Not with a gun.
{77387}{77468}But, brother,|I'm gonna worry you to death.
{77507}{77553}Now, chew.
{77556}{77655}See how it tastes. And swallow.
{77657}{77714}Chew!
{77776}{77845}You look like a man|that's got good sense.
{77847}{77898}Just name it, friend, and I'll do it.
{77901}{77964}You'll do it if you don't want|your pants full of lead.
{77966}{78020}All you gotta do is name it.
{78023}{78105}Give him a glass of water as soon|as we're gone to wash it down.
{78108}{78206}Everybody set? All you gotta do|is throw that door open and then step back.
{78209}{78281}- You don't have to tell me to step back.|- Don't hurt nobody.
{78284}{78374}Don't forget to throw a few rounds|down the street just for the fun of it.
{78376}{78429}Ready? Open it.
{78718}{78796}Stop them! Stop them!|Hurry! Hurry!
{78799}{78877}Get over there!|Get after them!
{78925}{78988}Get after them!|Come on! Everybody!
{79099}{79184}- Good-bye, Uncle Rufe.|- Good-bye, honey.
{79186}{79240}I don't blame you.
{79322}{79416}Jesse played fair.|He did everything he promised.
{79417}{79486}So you gotta keep|your part of the bargain.
{79489}{79604}And stick to him, honey, 'cause you're|the only hope there is for him.
{79606}{79672}- I'll stick all right.|- Miss Zee?
{79674}{79728}Is we|got everything?
{79731}{79785}Oh, I-
{79788}{79845}- I-I think so, Pinkie.|- Yes'm.
{79847}{79908}- Good-bye, Uncle Rufus.|- Good-bye, honey.
{79910}{79967}Let's go.
{81024}{81077}Come on, son. Play Pony Express.
{82418}{82501}Well, I guess they'll be|busy there for a while.
{83250}{83300}- Darling!|- Oh, Zee.
{83303}{83353}Oh, darling!
{83354}{83403}Darling.
{83559}{83608}Just let me|look at you.
{83743}{83834}You like the curtains?
{83837}{83901}Why, they're just as pretty|as they can be.
{83904}{83953}I made them.
{84007}{84063}Oh, my goodness, Zee. L-
{84066}{84141}I never expected ever|to have a house as nice as this one.
{84144}{84231}- I made that too.|- "God bless our home."
{84234}{84293}That's better than you|can get in a store, Zee.
{84295}{84360}- That's a mighty pretty frame too.|- Oh, Pinkie made that.
{84362}{84444}- Oh? Good work, Pinkie.|- Thank you, Mr. Jesse.
{84447}{84553}Oh, it sure is fine,|Zee. The whole place.
{84555}{84626}I'm just as proud of you|as I can be.
{84628}{84678}Git.
{84836}{84916}Whoa. Hello!
{85057}{85106}Hello.
{85164}{85225}- Uh, evening, ma'am.|- Good evening.
{85227}{85286}I'm lookin' for the Wilsons.|Do you know where they live?
{85289}{85338}About a mile|on up the road.
{85341}{85397}Thank you, ma'am.|Giddyap.
{85462}{85511}- Pack.|- Yes'r.
{85514}{85566}- Jesse.|- Pack. We're getting out of here.
{85568}{85629}- But it was only a farmer.|- How do you know?
{87148}{87280}- How is she, Doc?|- She's weak, of course, which is only-
{87282}{87373}- You're a friend of Mr. Howard's, aren't you?|- You might say so.
{87376}{87454}- Have you any idea where he is?|- He travels a lot.
{87455}{87533}- Salesman?|- Uh, something like that.
{87536}{87585}You can tell him for me...
{87588}{87676}any husband who would stay away|from a wife at a time like this...
{87679}{87729}I can't say I've got any use for him.
{87732}{87826}- There's a lot in what you say.|- You can go up, but don't stay long.
{87903}{87971}Ain't he|the dag-blamedest...
{87974}{88029}cutest little cuss|that ever-
{88167}{88309}Now, honey, you mustn't blame Jesse|for not gettin' here.
{88312}{88408}Maybe he just couldn't|get away, and, uh-
{88410}{88482}- It doesn't matter.|- Well, you-
{88484}{88556}You shouldn't feel|that way about it.
{88559}{88608}I can't help it.
{88611}{88691}I'm too tired to care.
{88785}{88839}This is the way|it always is.
{88887}{88986}We live like animals,|scared animals.
{89027}{89121}We move.|We hide.
{89124}{89204}We don't dare go out.
{89206}{89263}All day and all night,|we just sit.
{89306}{89363}Scared of a shadow|on a window.
{89404}{89486}Scared of a footstep|on a porch.
{89489}{89538}Scared of a door opening.
{89588}{89642}And when he's away,|it's worse.
{89679}{89741}All I can think of is,|is he dead?
{89744}{89832}- Is he lying dead in the mud in the woods?|- Shh. Shh, shh, honey.
{89899}{90006}Maybe he's dead now.
{90008}{90077}Oh, Uncle Rufe,|I wanna go home.
{90138}{90228}You're home, Zee.|This is your home-yours and Jesse's.
{90231}{90339}I mean home with you,|back to Liberty.
{90375}{90446}- Will you take me?|- But, honey-
{90449}{90547}Doggone it, I-|But Jesse promised.
{90550}{90617}Oh. Yes, I know.
{90651}{90700}And I used to believe him.
{90735}{90812}But he'd never change.
{90815}{90905}Jesse will be an outlaw|as long as he lives.
{90908}{90957}I know it now.
{91000}{91050}He's wild, Will.
{91053}{91124}He's like a horse|you can't break.
{91126}{91176}He's crazy with wildness,|and there's nothing...
{91179}{91278}either you or me or him|or anybody else can do about it.
{91343}{91425}That's why all last night|I wanted to die.
{91427}{91482}I prayed and prayed|that I'd die.
{91484}{91561}And my baby. L-
{91564}{91614}I prayed that he'd die too|and end it all!
{91742}{91792}Oh.
{91795}{91852}My darling.
{91855}{91936}Mommy didn't mean that, honey!
{91939}{91988}Oh, my precious baby!
{91991}{92058}Mommy didn't mean that,|honey.
{92061}{92138}That's-
{92140}{92238}That's-|That's all right, honey.
{92240}{92297}I'll-
{92299}{92371}I'll take you home.
{92373}{92422}I'll-
{92745}{92794}- Hi, Pinkie. Zee!|- Howdy, Mr. Jesse.
{92796}{92846}- Oh, Mr. Jesse.|- Yes?
{92905}{92986}- She's gone.|- Gone? Gone where?
{92988}{93038}- Herand the baby, they've gone-|- The baby?
{93041}{93092}- Yes'r.|- Was she-Were they all right?
{93095}{93161}Oh, yes'r.|They's all right, both of' em.
{93163}{93213}But she gone now.
{93215}{93285}The major come and took' em away|back to Liberty.
{93288}{93354}This here's a letter she gimme|to give to you, sir.
{93932}{93981}Poor kid.
{94030}{94090}I tried to get here, Pinkie,|but I- I just couldn't.
{94093}{94182}They got after me, and-|Did you see him?
{94184}{94269}Mr. Jesse, he's the cutest|little ol' thing I ever did see.
{94272}{94347}Just yellin' and a-hollerin'|so it'd nearly bust your ears.
{94350}{94452}I bet he's the loudest-yellin'|baby that ever was born.
{94455}{94520}- What color eyes he got, Pinkie?|- Blue.
{94522}{94604}Great big ol' blue eyes, big as a saucer.|Lookin' right at you, sir.
{94607}{94658}Does he look like Zee?
{94661}{94719}- Like you.|- Naw!
{94722}{94772}He's the spittin' image|of you, Mr. Jesse.
{94774}{94824}Well, I'll be doggoned.
{94826}{94905}'Ceptin' he's bald.|He's bald as a peeled egg.
{94908}{95012}But, my goodness, Mr. Jesse,|that sure is one cute little ol' baby.
{95015}{95067}Well, I'll be doggoned.
{95069}{95143}Just yellin',|wavin' his little ol' arm.
{95186}{95260}- Doggone.|- Yes'r, we was all mighty proud of that baby.
{95263}{95348}Lord, Lord.
{95350}{95408}I guess we'd better go after them, Pinkie.|When did they leave?
{95410}{95472}- They left Monday.|- On the train?
{95475}{95528}No, sir.|In the major's buggy.
{95531}{95598}Oh. I don't like that.
{95600}{95650}We'll have some supper,|and then we'll go after them.
{95652}{95704}- But, Mr. Jesse.|- Yes?
{95707}{95816}- I don't know if I'd go after' em right now.|- No? Why not?
{95818}{95869}They got that Mr. Wright|with 'em.
{95912}{96023}- Wright?|- Yes'r, the police marshall. He come too.
{96147}{96212}I see.
{96215}{96273}Never mind the supper, Pinkie.|We'll start right now.
{96275}{96363}- You mean after' em?|- Yes. Right now.
{97019}{97078}What did she say|about being unhappy?
{97080}{97148}It was just like|I told you, Mr. Jesse.
{97151}{97244}She said she's scared all the time,|and I know she cried a lot.
{97247}{97325}She said she don't know|how she could stand it.
{97328}{97377}I see.
{97523}{97608}- I guess I can't blame her.|- That's just what she says.
{97651}{97700}I guess it was|pretty bad for her.
{97736}{97795}Yes, sir, I guess it was.
{97938}{97992}Pinkie, I'm not going|any further.
{97995}{98066}You mean you ain't|goin' after' em?
{98068}{98136}I've changed my mind.
{98138}{98242}She's right. There ain't any happiness|to be found with me.
{98245}{98344}If she can find it at all,|it's- it's without me.
{98347}{98418}- Yes'r.|- Tell her that.
{98420}{98476}Tell her I ain't gonna|bother her anymore.
{98478}{98568}If she can be happy now,|I'm- I'm glad.
{98570}{98641}Tell her that... too.
{98643}{98692}Yes, sir.
{98724}{98816}- And, Pinkie, tell her-|- Yes, sir?
{98905}{99006}Tell her not to let the baby|know anything about me. I won't mind.
{100044}{100102}- Roy!|- Yes, sir.
{100104}{100161}Take an editorial|on dentists!
{100164}{100224}Yes, sir.
{100227}{100297}Paragraph.
{100300}{100378}If we are ever to have|law and order in the West...
{100412}{100472}the first thing|we've got to do...
{100475}{100524}is take out|all the dentists-
{100527}{100585}Choo-choo! Choo!
{100587}{100641}Clang! Clang!|Choo! Choo!
{100644}{100705}Choo! Choo!
{100707}{100801}Help! Help! Save me! Save my life!
{100804}{100905}...and shoot 'em down|like dogs.
{100992}{101070}- Save me! Save me!|Don't let him get hold of me!
{101073}{101148}- Help! Help!|- Stop it! Both of you!
{101151}{101209}Stop it. Stop it.
{101212}{101261}Stop it.
{101264}{101358}- He's worse than the child.|- Ah, but they're great fun.
{101360}{101426}How old is he?
{101429}{101516}- Just five.|- You don't say? Mine's going on three.
{101518}{101590}Wait a minute.|Here.
{101592}{101642}- Can he have a piece?|- Uh, yes.
{101745}{101804}- Ah. Say, "Thank you, sir."|- Thank you, sir.
{101807}{101886}Ah, you're welcome.|Wonderful child.
{101888}{101954}- Thank you.|- Are you the editor, sir?
{101957}{102048}I am, sir. What can I do|for you, my friend?
{102051}{102113}- I want to run this card in your next issue.|- Eh?
{102116}{102180}"George Remington.|Remington Bluing Company, Philadelphia."
{102183}{102233}- "Now at Dixie Belle Hotel."|- Mm-hmm.
{102236}{102312}- How much, sir?|- Oh, I guess about a dollar will cover it...
{102315}{102380}- Mr. Remington.|- There you are.
{102382}{102430}- Thank you, sir.|- And thank you very much.
{102433}{102509}- Good-bye. Good-bye.|- Good-bye. Roy! Set this-
{102511}{102621}By the way, didn't that fella Jesse James|come from somewheres around here?
{102623}{102727}He did. Why?
{102729}{102826}Then I suppose you're protesting against|this amnesty offer by the governor, aren't you?
{102829}{102939}- What amnesty offer?|- Haven't you heard?
{102941}{102997}Well, sir, it's an outrage.
{102999}{103097}In Jefferson City the other day, a friend|of mine, a banker, was telling me about it.
{103100}{103157}The governor has promised amnesty-|a clean pardon-
{103160}{103232}to any member of the James gang|that will kill Jesse.
{103235}{103286}And that's in addition|to the reward.
{103288}{103342}- Are you sure of that?|- Positive, sir.
{103345}{103407}But that makes the state|a party to murder!
{103409}{103523}- Exactly what I said.|- Why, the dirty rotten things they-
{103525}{103625}- Thank you, sir. Thank you for the news.|- Not at all, sir. Not at all.
{103628}{103725}- I'll just have time to get it|into this week's edition.|- Zee.
{103728}{103781}- And an editorial!|- Please.
{103784}{103834}That don't prove anything.|He might've got it all wrong.
{103837}{103899}It doesn't matter.|It doesn't matter to me.
{103901}{103969}- That's all over now.|- Roy!
{103972}{104041}- You got that editorial|on dentists started yet?|- Yes, sir.
{104044}{104092}Well, change it|from dentists to governors...
{104095}{104162}and finish it like the one|I did last week on horse thieves.
{104164}{104213}Except this time, it's governors.
{104525}{104614}Whoa. Morning.
{104672}{104754}- Nice day, isn't it?|- I don't wanna buy nothin'.
{104756}{104852}I'm not selling anything.
{104855}{104906}You're Mrs. Bob Ford,|aren't you?
{104967}{105053}I'm Mrs. Ford, all right, but if'n it's|about my husband, I don't know anythin'.
{105056}{105110}I ain't see'd him in months.
{105112}{105180}He rid off|with them James boys...
{105183}{105238}and I ain't see'd|hair nor hide of 'im since.
{105241}{105326}It's not him I was looking for,|Mrs. Ford. It's you.
{105329}{105380}I got this here|Liberty paper yesterday...
{105383}{105441}and it's got some news in it|that might interest you.
{105444}{105521}And, uh, here's my card.
{105524}{105612}That's all.
{105966}{106016}- Here.|- What is it?
{106018}{106068}You know I can't read.
{106288}{106336}What's it say?
{106720}{106770}Well?
{106961}{107046}The bank at Northfield, Minnesota,|is the strongest bank in the Northwest.
{107049}{107113}It's wide open for us.
{107115}{107165}They've got $50,000 in gold|in the safe...
{107168}{107240}and all we gotta do is walk in|with a shovel and help ourselves.
{107243}{107306}So that's what|we're gonna do.
{107360}{107408}Well?
{107456}{107530}Well, uh,|as a matter of fact, Jesse-
{107533}{107592}- Well?|- Well-
{107595}{107644}Say, what is this|anyhow?
{107647}{107745}For more than a month, there's been|something funny goin' on. Now, what is it?
{107746}{107815}Well, to tell you|the truth, Jesse...
{107817}{107898}we don't exactly know|if we like this idea or not.
{107900}{107974}For one thing, that's|a mighty strong bank at Northfield...
{107977}{108049}and it's a long ways away.
{108051}{108116}- And for another-|- Yeah, go on.
{108119}{108224}Well, I been talkin' it over|with some of the boys, and, uh-
{108227}{108276}and, uh-
{108279}{108344}Well, you're taking chances,|Jesse, that we don't like.
{108347}{108399}Now, I ain't no coward,|and you know it...
{108402}{108459}but some of the things|you've got us into, it-
{108461}{108512}It scared|the livin' daylights outta me.
{108515}{108563}- You're takin' too many chances.|- Shut up!
{108566}{108649}- Go on.|- We all know you got your troubles.
{108652}{108766}- Forget that.|- Maybe you don't care if you get|shot full of buckshot or not.
{108768}{108833}But the way we feel about it-
{108836}{108912}We got a lot of respect for you,|Jesse, and you know it.
{108915}{109022}But the way you're goin' on is just like|you was tryin' to commit suicide.
{109115}{109188}- And just who do you think you are?|- Now, listen, Jesse-
{109191}{109245}Go on! Reach!
{109360}{109412}So you talked things over, did you?
{109414}{109497}And who are you,|the captain of this band?
{109499}{109569}Who's handling these jobs,|you or me or somebody else?
{109571}{109621}Well, I'll tell you|if you don't know. It's me!
{109622}{109734}I'm doin' it, see. And I'll ride up|the capitol steps if I feel like it.
{109841}{109935}So you talked it over, huh?|Without me.
{109937}{110066}Well, I don't like it, and it ain't|the way I aim to have things.
{110069}{110121}If that's the way you want it,|I give you leave now-
{110124}{110174}all of you-|to talk it over again.
{110177}{110264}Now. Outside.|Go on! Get out!
{110296}{110346}Now listen here, Jesse.
{110348}{110404}Yes, and you too.
{110407}{110456}You talked it over with 'em.
{110459}{110537}You think I need you-any of you?
{110539}{110619}You think I can't get a thousand men|to come in tomorrow morning with Jesse James?
{110621}{110690}Well, if you don't,|you're crazy. Now get out!
{111116}{111183}He acts like he's going crazy.
{111186}{111238}Ah, he gets worse every day.
{111240}{111305}I'll kill him for that,|if it's my last act.
{111364}{111438}Wait for me down at the creek.|I wanna talk to him.
{111800}{111849}Well?
{111852}{111902}In the first place, Jesse,|I just want you to understand...
{111904}{111977}I ain't a-scared of you|and I ain't a-scared of your guns.
{111980}{112029}So if you get to feelin'|like shootin'...
{112032}{112086}you just start drawin',|and I'll start drawin' too.
{112088}{112142}- Is that what you came back to tell me?|- No.
{112145}{112243}- That's to clear your conscience|if you get to feelin' ornery.|- I'll remember.
{112245}{112328}What I come back to tell you|was, you're a skunk.
{112420}{112534}- Wanna draw?|- Go on.
{112536}{112642}You're mean, Jesse,|and you're gettin' meaner every day.
{112644}{112726}I don't know if you're goin' crazy or not,|but sometimes it looks like it.
{112729}{112819}Ever since you come back from St. Joe,|it's been lookin' like it.
{112821}{112878}For one thing, there ain't enough money|in the world to take the chances...
{112881}{112952}you been makin' us take|the last year or two.
{112955}{113019}And for another, you wouldn't be slappin'|an old friend like Tom-
{113021}{113106}and him a slow draw-|if you was in your right mind.
{113109}{113180}So you're either crazy|or you're a skunk.
{113229}{113295}Go on.|Draw if you feel like it.
{113345}{113426}You go on.
{113429}{113497}You're my brother, Jesse. You're my|kid brother, and I reckon I love you.
{113547}{113621}But it ain't provin' anything|to let you get my head blowed off...
{113624}{113674}or your own.
{113675}{113752}I know how you feel about what happened|after the baby was born.
{113792}{113854}And I know you don't like|to get talked to this way...
{113857}{113971}but it's either this or see you get|"blammed" right outta your pants.
{113974}{114038}Somebody had to tell you|before it was too late.
{114104}{114166}So, what do you figure|you wanna do about it?
{114272}{114320}I'm sorry, Frank.
{114367}{114461}- Want me to fetch 'em back?|- Can you?
{114463}{114513}Sure, I can.
{114515}{114577}- Frank.|- Hmm?
{114580}{114656}- Much obliged.|- You're welcome, kid.
{114870}{114950}- Jesse.|- Bob?
{114953}{115016}- It's me.|- Come in.
{115146}{115233}- Where is everybody?|- They'll be back after a while.
{115597}{115696}- What's the matter with you?|- Nothing.
{115699}{115782}- Sit down.|- Nothing's the matter.
{116051}{116130}- I been to see my wife.|- I know.
{116300}{116370}- Hi, Bob.|- Hiya, fellas.
{116371}{116453}- I'm sorry.|- It's all right, Jesse. I understand.
{116456}{116518}Northfield's|all right with us.
{116521}{116591}Good. We'll get going|at daylight.
{116594}{116670}Northfield's 450 miles from here.|We oughta make it by Friday.
{116672}{116755}We'll hole up just outside of town|overnight and jump the bank|about noon on Saturday.
{116757}{116873}If it's as rich as they say it is,|why, maybe we can all retire then.
{116875}{116933}Sound all right to everyone?
{116935}{117003}That's fine.|Very fine.
{117371}{117428}- Thank you.|- You're welcome.
{117431}{117480}- Mr. Layworth?|- Right over there, sir.
{117483}{117532}Thank you.

{118279}{118329}- What does it mean?|- It's the James gang.
{118332}{118418}- They're on their way here.|- Here? The James gang?
{118421}{118487}- Mm-hmm.|- The James gang!
{118489}{118539}- To rob my bank?|- That's it.
{118542}{118596}Great thunderin' hallelujah!|That's ruin!
{118599}{118671}They'll take everything!|I've got $50,000!
{118673}{118743}Shh. Easy, easy.|There's no danger.
{118745}{118795}Don't you see?|I'm here.
{118798}{118847}Yeah, but-but-but-
{120619}{120668}Why, Cousin Bushrod!

{122568}{122643}I'll have to get the money from the safe.|Will you wait, please?
{123017}{123106}- Holy smoke.|- Come on!
{123368}{123418}- Tom. Come on, Tom.|- It's no use.

{125658}{125715}We gotta keep goin', son.|Hold on.
{125717}{125795}Hold tight, Jesse,|'cause there's only one way outta here.
{125798}{125847}Are ya holdin' on?
{125924}{125973}Giddyap!
{126343}{126420}Jesse!|Jesse!
{126832}{126906}Hurry up, boys. Hurry up.|He's in here somewhere.
{128354}{128470}"Of the eight bandits who attempted|the raid on the Northfield bank...
{128472}{128535}"two are dead|and four are prisoners.
{128538}{128631}"But of the two leaders,|there is less definite news.
{128634}{128764}"Reports yesterday indicated|that Frank James had made good his escape.
{128766}{128850}"But of Jesse James,|there is no news at all.
{128852}{128937}"The beliefis|that he was drowned.
{128940}{129035}"But if he escaped,|he is thought to be badly wounded...
{129037}{129087}and unable to travel far."
{129089}{129182}Holy dag-blasted...
{129185}{129245}goldang city police!
{129248}{129297}- Roy!|- Yes, sir?
{129300}{129379}I'm gonna write me|an editorial!
{129414}{129469}"If he escaped."
{129545}{129619}- You gotta stop it, Zee. You got to.|- I know it.
{129622}{129676}He ain't the Jesse|you knew and loved.
{129678}{129739}That fella's gone,|gone a long time ago.
{129742}{129811}I kinda liked him too.|But not this fella. Not this bad one.
{129813}{129902}This one, I could-|Well, if I ever come on him again-
{129904}{129973}- If he escaped-|- Can't you understand, Zee? He's no good.
{129976}{130025}It's like I told you that time.
{130028}{130077}Once you let yourself go,|the way he did, you can't stop.
{130079}{130170}He ain't a knight anymore fightin'|a bad railroad. He's a wild animal.
{130172}{130223}You can't love him. Nobody can.
{130226}{130341}Why, everybody that liked him,|he's done wrong to.
{130343}{130425}And with his men gone,|he hasn't a friend left...
{130428}{130481}not a friend in the world.
{130484}{130538}That's right too, isn't it?
{130602}{130653}Not a friend in the world.
{130886}{130935}Ho.
{131157}{131260}Hey. Hey, you. You. We're here.
{131450}{131508}Thank you.
{131616}{131674}- Keep your mouth shut.|- Thank you. Thank you very kindly.
{131743}{131796}- Do you think you can make it?|- Yeah.
{131902}{131976}- Do you need some help?|- No. I'm all right.
{131978}{132030}- You go ahead.|- Giddyap.
{133877}{133954}Oh, my poor, poor darling.
{133956}{134015}My poor, hurt darling.
{134157}{134261}Zee? Is it really you?
{134264}{134359}I knew, if you could,|you'd come here.
{134362}{134429}That's why I came.
{134432}{134481}I knew you'd come.
{134511}{134567}What's left of me.
{134608}{134672}But... I'll get you well.
{134701}{134761}Wait.
{134821}{134871}Jesse.
{134873}{134940}Hurry, Pinkie.|Hurry.
{135425}{135483}Well, I'll be doggone.
{135696}{135745}It's Daddy, dear.
{136016}{136064}My son.
{136106}{136184}Oh, Mommy.
{136186}{136241}Daddy's been hurt, dear,|but he'll be all right.
{136298}{136352}Well, I'll be doggone.
{136445}{136504}Doggone.
{136537}{136587}Don't you think|he's big for five?
{136759}{136846}Does he- Does he|know anything about me yet?
{136849}{136912}No, not yet.
{137102}{137168}Oh, Zee.
{137170}{137271}Is it-|Is it too late?
{137273}{137359}Could we-|Could we still go away?
{137362}{137423}To California?
{137426}{137489}No, it isn't too late.
{137492}{137542}We'll go just as soon|as you get well.
{137545}{137600}Pinkie's gone|to get the doctor now.
{137633}{137723}Oh, Jesse,|I do love you so.
{138304}{138362}Jesse.
{138365}{138423}- You mustn't do that.|- Oh, go on. I'm all right.
{138425}{138508}But Pinkie will take care|of all that, darling.
{138510}{138595}Ah, Zee.|Kinda happy, ain't ya?
{138597}{138650}Aren't you?
{138653}{138771}Oh, Jesse, if we were|just leaving today, this very hour.
{138772}{138846}- Nothing's gonna stop us, honey.|- Oh, I hope not.
{138906}{138959}But I'm scared, Jesse.
{138961}{139052}I'll be scared every second|until we're on our way...
{139054}{139126}maybe until|we get to California.
{139129}{139194}Well, we-we won't have|any money, remember.
{139196}{139298}- That money I hid in the hills-|- I don't want you to talk about that anymore.
{139301}{139380}We'll make money-|money we won't be ashamed of.
{139382}{139448}- I wasn't ashamed of that mon-|- Stop it, I say.
{139451}{139533}Mr. Howard.
{139536}{139597}- Yes?|- There's two gentlemen to see you, sir.
{139692}{139756}- What do they want?|- You knows 'em, sir.
{139788}{139880}Oh. All right.
{139882}{139936}He's human, ain't he?
{140081}{140130}Well, hello, Bob.|How are ya?
{140132}{140183}I'm all right, I reckon.|How are you, Jesse?
{140185}{140261}I'm still totin' some lead around|inside of me, but it doesn't bother me any.
{140264}{140333}- This here's my brother, Charlie.|- Hello, Charlie.
{140336}{140386}Oh, Pinkie,|get us some coffee.
{140388}{140436}- Yes, sir.|- Sit down, Bob.
{140498}{140557}Looks like|you come a long way. It's hot.
{140617}{140690}I escaped. They couldn't hold me.
{140693}{140755}Me and two fellas you don't know|jumped over a wall.
{140758}{140825}How'd you know where I was?
{140828}{140896}We seen Frank. He sent us.
{140898}{140948}That's what we come|to see you about.
{140951}{141007}How's Frank? Where is he?
{141009}{141103}He's fine. He's up in the hills.
{141106}{141156}He's aimin' to come down pretty soon.
{141159}{141210}That's what he wanted us|to see you about.
{141213}{141255}Jesse.
{141348}{141415}- Are you going to be long?|- You remember Bob Ford, honey.
{141418}{141512}- That's his brother, Charlie.|- Howdy, Miss Zee.
{141514}{141569}- Are you going to be long?|- Go on now. Stop your frettin'.
{141572}{141644}I'll be up in just a minute.
{141748}{141850}What Frank wanted us to tell ya|is if you feel strong enough,|he wants you to meet him.
{141853}{141972}- He's at the Platte Bank.|- No. I'm going to California.
{141974}{142087}- Frank's mighty anxious.|- Sorry. My mind's made up.
{142090}{142167}There ain't even a marshall in town.|There's a farm payroll there on the seventh.
{142170}{142218}Frank's got three men|that know their business.
{142221}{142299}He don't figure it'll be any trouble at all.|Just walk in and take it.
{142794}{142843}No.
{142906}{142956}If you got plenty of money|to get a start in California...
{142958}{143010}you don't even need|to think about it.
{143012}{143076}But if you was to need|a bankroll, why-
{143185}{143275}I haven't got much money,|hardly any money at all.
{143578}{143627}What else did Frank say?
{143667}{143721}He says it's the easiest|job he ever seen.
{143724}{143786}He says it won't take|more than a day to look it over.
{143787}{143861}And then if you're set on goin'|to the coast, you got some money.
{143901}{143950}We sure could use|some money.
{143952}{144027}The way this is, it's just like pickin' it|up off the ground.
{144080}{144138}- When did he wanna meet me?|- He says right away.
{144140}{144198}Daddy! Daddy!
{144201}{144270}I wanna come in!|I wanna come in!
{144273}{144322}He can't go in.|He'll spoil the game!
{144325}{144414}All right. Come in,|but stop that hollerin'.
{144417}{144499}Frank figures we oughta clear|about 2,000 apiece.
{144560}{144628}Sure could use $2,000.
{144630}{144725}- Daddy! Daddy!|- Oh, those kids. Just a minute.
{144777}{144871}- Oh, excuse me, Mr. James.|- Howard.
{144873}{144926}Are you gonna walk around|outside with them guns?
{144929}{145006}No. You're right.
{145008}{145100}Bang! Bang! Bang!
{145102}{145187}Bang! Bang!|Bring him down!
{145406}{145504}- We didn't hurt him, Mr. Howard.|- We just killed him. That's part of the game.
{145506}{145557}He's such a little fella.|You shouldn't play so rough with him.
{145560}{145617}- That's the way you gotta play outlaw.|- He's Jesse James.
{145620}{145707}- He's gotta die.|- I'll die, but they stick me with sticks.
{145709}{145776}- Just shoot me. Don't stick me.|- Bang! Bang!
{145778}{145847}- Bang! Bang!|- You're Jesse James. You're dead.
{145849}{145898}I'm dead.
{146074}{146123}Go home, boys.
{146877}{146950}Get him ready.|We're catching the afternoon train.
{146952}{147012}Pinkie can follow|with whatever we can't carry.
{147043}{147091}That suit you?
{147140}{147190}Oh, thank goodness, Jesse.
{147404}{147487}I'm sorry Bob. Tell Frank I'm sorry.|I'll write to him from California.
{147488}{147562}- You mean you ain't gonna come with us?|- That's it.
{147565}{147634}- What'll Frank say to that?|- It can't make much difference what he says.
{147637}{147686}I ain't goin' to him,|and that's all there is to it.
{147689}{147738}Bye, Charlie.|Nice to meet ya.
{147741}{147823}Bye, Bob. I'm sorry you had to come|all the way up here for nothing.
{147826}{147875}What'll we tell Frank?
{147878}{147974}Tell him he'd better come join me|while the joining's still good.
{147977}{148035}#Oh, Mr. Howard|We've got to run #
{148038}{148139}- # For we're going to California-#|- #With a banjo on our knee #
{148198}{148259}Ah, Zee.
{148261}{148315}- Honey, what can I do to help?|- Oh, Jesse, that.
{148318}{148374}Oh, you can|bet your life. Zee.
{148414}{148472}#'Cause we're going|to California #
{148474}{148553}#On a train this afternoon ##
{149192}{149243}Jesse!
{149310}{149388}Pinkie!
{149390}{149471}Oh, Jesse.|Jesse.
{149504}{149567}Oh, Jesse!
{149618}{149673}There ain't no question|about it.
{149676}{149794}Jesse was an outlaw,|a bandit, a criminal.
{149796}{149918}Even those that loved him|ain't got no answer to that.
{149921}{150005}But we ain't ashamed of him.|I don't know why...
{150008}{150119}but I don't think even America|is ashamed of Jesse James.
{150122}{150198}Maybe it's because|he was bold and lawless...
{150201}{150290}like we, all of us,|like to be sometimes.
{150293}{150368}Maybe it's because|we understand a little...
{150371}{150426}that he wasn't|altogether to blame...
{150429}{150478}for what his times|made him.
{150481}{150547}Maybe it's because|for 10 years...
{150550}{150620}he licked the tar|outta five states.
{150623}{150742}Or maybe it's because he was|so good at what he was doin'.
{150745}{150820}I don't know.|All I do know is...
{150822}{150916}he was one of the|doggonedest, goldangedest...
{150918}{150978}dag-blamedest buckaroos...
{150981}{151107}that ever rode across|these United States of America!
{151217}{151279}"In loving remembrance...
{151281}{151331}"Jesse W. James...
{151333}{151409}"died April 3, 1882.
{151412}{151520}"Aged 34 years, 6 months,|28 days.
{151522}{151606}"Murdered by a traitor|and coward...
{151608}{151716}whose name is not worthy|to appear here."
{3612}{3673}Ah!
{3675}{3726}{y:i}Ja! Wunderbar!
{4116}{4163}Look at that, Karl.
{4401}{4455}Well, Roy, you seem|to like my country.
{4456}{4522}Like it?|I think it's marvelous.
{4524}{4595}Say, I wish we were|staying here two years|instead of just two weeks.
{4597}{4669}But you know, Karl,|it does sound funny hearing you|call it "your country. "
{4671}{4717}I keep forgetting|you're not English.
{4719}{4802}Oh, sometimes I...|Well, I feel almost English myself.
{4804}{4882}Well, that's natural.|After all, you can't be|at Oxford three years...
{4884}{4941}without feeling|slightly British.
{5301}{5356}I wish Helen were here.
{5358}{5415}After all you've said about her,|I don't blame you.
{5528}{5588}Your brother is not coming|today, Herr Rutledge?
{5590}{5679}Oh, yes, he'll be along soon, Gretchen.|Nothing can keep Monte away|from this good beer.
{5681}{5738}Nothing except|a good-looking woman.
{5740}{5795}{y:i}Jawohl.
{5797}{5872}That brother of yours,|he's a naughty boy,
{5874}{5920}but I like him.
{5922}{5968}He has a way with them,|hey, Gretchen?
{5970}{6079}You, you don't know|half of it.
{6081}{6151}Another conquest for Monte.
{6152}{6263}Yes. I don't know why|he wants to mess about|with every woman he meets.
{6265}{6335}Yeah, but you have Helen.
{6337}{6397}I'm not at all sure.
{6399}{6482}I'm not half good enough|for her.|She must be a wonderful girl.
{6484}{6567}Oh, she is.|She's marvelous.
{6568}{6615}You'll have to meet her|when we get back to Oxford.
{6616}{6703}- I'd like to.|- Would you like to see|what she looks like?
{6705}{6802}Yes. I didn't know|you had a photograph of her.|Yeah, and neither does Helen.
{6804}{6871}I took it myself|when she wasn't looking.|Really?
{6978}{7024}Oh.|Stunning, isn't she?
{7026}{7067}Why, she's marvelous.
{7202}{7248}Cheerio, you blighters.
{7250}{7296}Hello, it's Monte.
{7298}{7355}Meet the countess.|Step up, gents,|to the one and only...
{7357}{7403}Now, Monte, don't, please.|Oh, it's all right.
{7405}{7454}This little pretzel|doesn't understand|a word of English.|No?
{7456}{7518}Gretchen!|Ja!
{7689}{7752}Found her at the museum.
{7754}{7831}Yeah, she's a work of art,|all right.|You should have left her there.
{8054}{8131}Shh! Quiet!
{8171}{8217}I say, Monte, why do you|bring around this sort?
{8219}{8313}Bring her?|Good heavens,|I can't get rid of her.
{8352}{8407}Go home, will you?|Go home.
{8495}{8542}You see, I'm stuck.
{8544}{8610}Hello. Who's the dowager?|That's Helen.
{8612}{8695}Oh.|But, of course, that's only a snapshot.|Wait till you meet her.
{8728}{8778}{y:i}Oh, yeah?|Yeah.
{8780}{8835}Go away!
{8900}{8983}I say.|This is getting serious.|I've got to get rid of her.
{8985}{9058}Oh, you know, I have|a very important engagement|in just 15 minutes.
{9060}{9135}I say, you chaps,|be... be sporting|and take her off my hands.
{9137}{9212}But after all, Monte...|We may be sporting,|but we're not feeble-minded.
{9214}{9274}Well, you can do|what you please with her.|I'm going.
{9275}{9394}{y:i}Hey, listen, Monte...|Auf Wiedersehen.
{9515}{9561}Here, just a minute now.|Please.
{9563}{9616}Leave her to me.|I'll get rid of her.
{9618}{9683}Please. Yes.
{9685}{9736}{y:i}Ja.
{9738}{9833}{y:i}Nein. Nein. Nein. Nein.
{9835}{9914}{y:i}Roy! No! Roy!|No, carry on. Carry on.
{10408}{10503}Pretty boy,|you please me very much.
{11337}{11383}What's that?
{11436}{11555}It is nothing.|I am not at home to anyone|except my husband.
{11556}{11606}And he is away|on army business.
{11608}{11665}He will not be home for hours.
{11667}{11713}So, you see...
{12103}{12149}Charming.
{12392}{12444}But really, I-I say|you mustn't think that...
{12446}{12515}Your name?
{12517}{12587}My name is, uh,|Rutledge, sir.
{12589}{12645}You are stopping in Munich?
{12647}{12701}At the Hotel Bayrischer Hof, sir.
{12937}{13019}{y:i}My seconds|will call on you later.
{13020}{13067}But I say you...
{13068}{13151}There is nothing further|to discuss.
{13482}{13571}Sailing, sailing|over the bounding main
{13573}{13654}Where many a wintery wind shall blow|'ere Jack comes home again
{13656}{13717}Hello. Where you going?|Sailing, sailing|England.
{13719}{13812}England? Why, we're not|going back for 10 days.
{13814}{13893}{y:i}What's wrong?
{13895}{13952}Baron Von Kranz.|Who's he?
{13954}{14006}Oh, he's just a friend of mine.|Really?
{14007}{14091}Quite a social success, aren't you?|How do you meet these barons?
{14093}{14156}Well, unfortunately,|I met this one through his wife.
{14204}{14283}And this means...|A duel.|Can you imagine it?
{14309}{14369}Running away?|Oh, don't be an ass. Roy.
{14371}{14453}You don't expect me|to go through with a farce like this.|It's the only thing you can do.
{14455}{14542}Oh, there you go again.|I suppose when a woman's no good|and her husband finds it out,
{14544}{14599}I've got to get shot,|just because it's|the honorable thing to do.
{14600}{14673}Well, what do you think|people will say?|You'll never live it down.
{14675}{14727}What do I care|what people say?
{14729}{14787}Well, you can talk|all you like, Monte,|but you can't walk out like this.
{14789}{14842}Can't I?
{14843}{14908}Good-bye.|See you at Oxford.
{15125}{15174}Hello, Roy.|Hello, Karl.
{15201}{15250}Well, what's up?|Where's Monte?
{15252}{15295}He's gone to England.
{15297}{15371}England?|Well, what's the matter?
{15422}{15476}Oh, nothing.|But I say...
{15644}{15712}Herr Rutledge?
{15782}{15828}Herr Rutledge?
{15830}{15902}Yes?|Von Richter.
{15904}{15954}Von Schlieben.
{15956}{16023}We represent|Colonel Baron Von Kranz.
{16024}{16071}Yes.
{16072}{16119}Have you chosen your second?
{16260}{16359}According to custom,|we have selected|the time and place.
{16360}{16415}You have the choice of weapons.
{16520}{16566}What is your choice?
{16932}{16979}What is this?
{17033}{17091}Golden Aue.
{17093}{17169}Why, that's a famous|dueling place near here.
{17213}{17285}It says at 4:00|tomorrow morning.
{17287}{17337}4:00 in the morning.
{17339}{17385}Well, how did this happen?
{17427}{17523}I- I'm sorry, Karl.|I- I lost my temper|with one of your officers.
{17525}{17591}But, Roy...|Say, Karl, do you know|how to be a second?
{17943}{17990}Wait here, Roy.
{18258}{18307}{y:i}Bitte.
{18843}{18889}Good luck, Roy.
{20048}{20130}Did you ever see a lassie|a lassie, a lassie
{20131}{20181}Did you ever see a lassie|go this way and that
{20183}{20246}{y:i}Hey, will you cut it out?
{20309}{20363}Hey, did anybody|see my green socks?
{20364}{20438}{y:i}Check in the garbage.|Hello there, Roy.
{20440}{20490}Hello, Elliot.|Glad to see you.|I'm certainly glad to see you back.
{20492}{20539}Thank you.|And where's your German accent?
{20540}{20598}Well, I couldn't get it|past the Custom officials.
{20600}{20655}Oh, I say, what have|you done to your arm?
{20656}{20716}Oh, nothing.|It's just a little scratch.|I was hunting in Germany.
{20718}{20764}I'll see you at dinner?|Righto.
{20766}{20805}Good.|See you later.
{20807}{20858}Why aren't you getting dressed?|Aren't you coming to meet Helen?

{22032}{22100}She's expecting us.|Would you care to wait?
{22125}{22171}Yes, thank you.
{22712}{22759}Fine reception.
{22936}{22983}Oh.
{23244}{23308}Roy, maybe she's forgotten.
{23310}{23365}Not Helen.|She's not that sort.
{23367}{23413}Oh.
{23807}{23916}Roy, I feel sick.|I- I think I'd better go.
{23918}{24004}- Monte, will you sit down?|- Oh, I've got an awful headache.
{24006}{24066}{y:i}I think I'll go to the chemist|and get something for it.|Monte.
{24332}{24397}- Roy!|- Helen!
{24399}{24459}Oh, terribly sorry.|Mother's fault. Shopping.
{24461}{24517}I simply flew|My, isn't it hot?
{24519}{24590}You shouldn't have hurried so.|Oh, but I wanted to.
{24592}{24659}Roy, you've no right|to look so cool.|I'm broiling.
{24661}{24709}Feel.
{24711}{24757}Yes, you are, aren't you?
{24759}{24806}No, not one.
{24807}{24864}Well, you're so marvelous,|I- I hardly dare.
{24866}{24912}Oh, silly.
{24984}{25031}Well, that's better.
{25032}{25095}Cigarette, Roy?
{25097}{25166}I thought your brother|was coming.|Went out with a headache.
{25167}{25227}Poor boy.|It must be the heat.
{25463}{25567}{y:i}Extry, extry! All about the war!
{25936}{26017}Well, they've done it.|I never thought they would.
{26048}{26128}I still can't believe it.|Well, it must be true.|It's official.
{26130}{26175}Oh, shut up.|I'm trying to think.
{26176}{26228}It's terrible.
{26230}{26311}Karl, you won't|have to go, will you?
{26312}{26388}Me? Oh, Roy, I hope not.
{26390}{26474}Oh, they can't want me.|I'm not a soldier.
{26476}{26546}What use would I be|to them?
{26547}{26638}I couldn't... kill anyone.
{26639}{26687}They couldn't make me do that,|could they, Roy?
{26689}{26738}Oh, I think it'll all be over|in a couple of weeks.
{26769}{26871}I'm not so sure.|I wouldn't worry about it.
{26872}{26949}Then suppose|England comes in.
{26951}{27017}Why, Roy,|that'd be horrible.
{27019}{27078}I never could do that.|Why, I love England.
{27080}{27147}Oh, will you shut up?
{27149}{27244}Monte, Germany's|declared war on France.
{27270}{27335}Hmm? Oh.
{27336}{27426}Oh, Roy,|how do you spell "ecstatic"?
{27487}{27533}Hmm?
{27783}{27843}Special delivery letter|for Karl Arnstedt.
{28418}{28492}What's the matter, Karl?|Someone ill?
{28837}{28883}Karl.
{29210}{29329}May I ask the Prime Minister|if he has any information|he can give us today.
{29331}{29455}Our ambassador at Berlin|received his passport|at 7:00 last evening.
{29456}{29511}And since 11:00 last night,
{29513}{29620}a state of war has existed|between Germany and ourselves.
{29719}{29769}Seven?
{29771}{29842}What size?|A seven and a half|if you please.
{29899}{29955}I- I'm afraid it's a bit small, sir.
{29957}{30026}Move along, there.|Move along.|You'll grow into it.
{30102}{30163}Present arms!
{30165}{30226}Come on there.|Come on.
{30228}{30290}Present arms!
{30315}{30362}Give it to him,|you bloody fool.
{30363}{30443}Hey, what's wrong with you?|Sleeping sickness?
{30444}{30557}Here, here.|Let go of that gun,|you clinging vine.
{30559}{30605}Let go, do you hear?
{30607}{30680}God, you're enough|to turn a man's stomach.
{30682}{30734}Hey, you with|the fallen arches...
{30771}{30831}I've enlisted, Monte,|in the Royal Flying Corps.
{30833}{30885}You're a fool, Roy.
{30946}{31023}Really? How lovely.
{31025}{31100}My grandfather was in the guard|during the Revolution.|Oh, he was?
{31102}{31166}Oh, Roy, you look marvelous|in uniform.|Thank you.
{31167}{31214}Doesn't he?|It's ripping.
{31215}{31292}Where?|Tell me, what have you joined?|The infantry?
{31294}{31352}No, the Royal Flying Corps.|Oh, of course.
{31405}{31489}And all the misery in this world|has been caused...
{31491}{31571}by and for capitalism!
{31573}{31623}Why should we fight this war?
{31625}{31707}For capitalism?
{31708}{31759}You will die!|You will die!
{31761}{31852}{y:i}All your sons will die|for capitalism!
{31854}{31933}Down with capitalism!|Down with war!
{31935}{31991}Down with the anarchists.
{31992}{32063}{y:i}That's right.
{32459}{32539}Get back now.|Who do you think you're shoving?
{32563}{32610}There's the man|I'd like to kiss.
{32611}{32665}{y:i}What's the matter?|Afraid of a kiss?|Maybe he's yeller!
{32667}{32732}Go on, you.|Go on and fight for your country.
{32734}{32781}{y:i}Slacker!
{32783}{32820}Come on.
{33275}{33330}But really,|you don't understand.
{33331}{33397}I didn't mean to do anything.
{33399}{33462}Say, I'd rather marry the girl.
{33984}{34064}You'll never get|your wings that way.
{34066}{34120}Hi. How are you?|Oh, boy.
{34122}{34192}Say, listen, that first solo flight|certainly is a great thrill.
{34194}{34240}It certainly felt great.
{34366}{34414}I will.
{34467}{34529}{y:i}Wonder who that is out there.|That was a fine landing.
{34583}{34650}{y:i}Look at him come out of there.
{34738}{34791}Look, boys, it's Monte.
{34910}{34998}Hey, how'd it go, Monte?|Oh, great.
{35760}{35826}Well, tonight's|the night, Monte.|Yeah.
{35827}{35902}Say, listen, be more cheerful.|You have a treat in store|meeting Helen.
{35903}{35951}Must be Friday the 13th.
{35952}{36015}Gee, I-I wonder if she'll wear|her canteen uniform.
{36017}{36100}If she does,|you can count me out.|Oh, she looks stunning in it.
{36102}{36196}Who wants to be stunned?|I'm only going as a favor to you.
{36198}{36244}You and I don't like|the same kind of girls.
{36246}{36304}Hurry up, will you?
{36306}{36380}Oh, it's a waste of time|to polish these.
{36382}{36463}She'll probably step all over them|the first dance anyway.
{36495}{36541}Safer to sit it out.
{36543}{36611}Quiet little corner|and a have a chat|about votes for women.
{36652}{36687}Hello there.|Hello.
{36688}{36735}Whose window|are you warbling under tonight?
{36736}{36820}Lady Randolph's Charity Ball.|Wash your neck and come along.|Oh, but I haven't been invited.
{36822}{36906}That's all right.|I'm on the committee.|No, I don't think I'll go.
{36908}{36958}A smart boy.
{37891}{37941}I wonder where Helen is.|She should be here by this time.
{38049}{38096}How do you do, sir?
{38289}{38363}There's she is.|Don't point. It's rude.
{38365}{38411}Oh, Helen.
{38413}{38457}Roy!
{38548}{38588}Hello.|Hello, old thing.
{38590}{38636}You're frightfully late.|I was afraid you weren't coming.
{38638}{38749}Oh, Helen, this is Monte.|How do you do?
{38751}{38819}How do you do?
{38821}{38903}Well, that's done at last.
{38905}{38961}You know, you two have been|avoiding each other for weeks.
{39005}{39063}Helen, may I have|this next dance?
{39065}{39119}What? Oh, of course.
{39144}{39223}Oh, Roy, there you are.|Good evening, Lady Randolph.
{39224}{39288}I must say, you take your duties|on my committee very lightly.|I'm sorry.
{39290}{39355}Where have you been?|You've completely disarranged|my program.
{39356}{39418}There are no end of things|to be done. Helen dear,|you don't mind, do you?
{39420}{39469}Come along, Roy.|Come at once.|I'm sorry, Helen.
{39471}{39559}Uh, Monte, would you take|this next dance with Helen?
{39561}{39621}Oh, how do you do, Monte?|How do you do?|Now come along.
{39710}{39756}Well?
{40290}{40371}Ahem.|Oh. Hello, Roy.
{40373}{40468}I- I really must go and find,|uh, Jimmy Kerrigan.
{40470}{40532}He has something|most important to tell me.
{40534}{40580}I...
{40646}{40692}Who is this Jimmy Kerrigan?
{40694}{40771}Kerrigan?|I've never heard of him.
{40773}{40819}Oh.
{41166}{41222}What are you thinking of?
{41223}{41303}If you must know,|I was thinking of Monte.
{41304}{41354}Do you like him?|Yes, I like him.
{41355}{41406}He's a marvelous dancer.
{41446}{41506}Well, Monte does|all those things well.
{41616}{41679}Helen.|What?
{41681}{41727}May I?
{42183}{42253}Oh, Monte.|Oh, hello there.
{42255}{42301}Come sit down.
{42356}{42418}You having a better time|than you expected, Monte?
{42419}{42491}Marvelous. Been dancing|with a beautiful brunette,|name of Eleanor.
{42492}{42576}She's perfect.|Oh, Eleanor Madden.
{42578}{42631}You don't really think|she's beautiful?
{42633}{42702}Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty?|Stop it.|I'm not a cat.
{42703}{42750}Yes, you are.
{42751}{42827}Well, if I'm a kitty,|I'm a thirsty kitty.
{42829}{42885}Roy dear, will you please|get me a glass of punch?
{42887}{42936}Why, of course I will.|No, I'll go, Roy.
{42938}{42984}No, I'm the committee.
{42986}{43066}You stay here|and look after this wallflower.
{43067}{43167}But really, I...|Oh, if you'd rather not...
{43169}{43235}Well, I-I didn't mean...
{43367}{43427}Don't you like wallflowers?
{43834}{43899}I shouldn't have done that.|Oh, you're not sorry, Monte.
{43901}{43963}Awfully sorry.|I had no right to.
{43965}{44029}What if I'm glad?
{44031}{44120}But what about Roy?|Isn't that my business?
{44147}{44205}I suppose so, but...|Hush.
{44323}{44396}Compliments of the committee.|Thanks awfully, Roy.
{44398}{44444}Well, has he been|properly charming?
{44446}{44515}Me?|More than charming.
{44516}{44563}Good for you, Monte.
{44597}{44643}Taste?
{45680}{45735}She loves me.|She blisters you.
{45737}{45790}It's worth it.|Is she worth it?
{45791}{45854}Depends on who she is.
{45919}{45965}- Hello.|- Hello.
{45967}{46043}Well, thank goodness Lady Randolph's|lost sight of me for a minute.
{46044}{46114}Roy, you've been|neglecting me shamefully.
{46115}{46199}Oh, I'm terribly sorry.|You see, it's this beastly committee.
{46201}{46247}Lady Randolph|won't let me alone a minute.
{46249}{46317}{y:i}Oh, Roy, there you are.|Yes, here I am.
{46319}{46415}Do you mind? Where is that list?|Would you mind finding Sir John for me?
{46417}{46524}It's about my Canteen Unit.|I must have the queen's signature.|It's so important.
{46526}{46615}My dear, why don't you|get into your uniform?|You look so pretty in it.
{46617}{46668}And, Monte, shouldn't you dance|with Mary Blunt?
{46670}{46748}Yes, why don't you?|And, Roy. Roy,|will you find Sir John?
{46750}{46802}I want you to lead|the grand dance for me.
{46803}{46850}And really,|there are so many things|you've got to do.
{46851}{46923}Yes. L-I'm terribly sorry.|Uh, back soon.
{46925}{47008}You see, those girls|have been looking for you.|But, Lady Randolph, I'm supposed to...
{47070}{47147}So, you've really joined|Lady Lizzie's Canteen Unit?
{47148}{47198}Rather.|Chance of a lifetime.
{47200}{47273}We go to France in two weeks.|Two weeks?
{47275}{47342}Well, Roy says|you're sailing the 15th.
{47391}{47442}Is that so?
{47571}{47625}Bored?
{47627}{47698}Tired.|Take me home, Monte.
{47699}{47746}Home?|It's not far.
{47747}{47828}I've taken a flat in town|near Canteen Headquarters.
{47830}{47921}But, I mean,|Roy will be quite upset|to find you gone.
{47923}{47994}That's what he gets|for being on committee.
{47995}{48082}But, really...|Very well.|I'll find someone else.
{48084}{48131}Oh, I didn't mean to be rude.
{48132}{48196}Well, come on then.
{48523}{48616}Are we here?|Well, it's number 27.
{48618}{48676}Wanna come up|for a cigarette and a drink?
{48678}{48740}Oh, really,|you must be awfully tired.|No, I'm not.
{48742}{48827}Come see my room.|I've only had a place of my own|for a week.
{48829}{48901}It's a new toy.
{48903}{48971}What a baby you are.
{48972}{49040}Alley-oop.|All right.
{49267}{49316}Well, this is jolly.
{49318}{49364}Sit down|and I'll get you a drink.
{49366}{49412}Thanks.
{49563}{49619}Say when.|Whoa.
{49620}{49667}When! When!
{50235}{50299}Would you be shocked|if I put on something more comfortable?
{50301}{50364}I'll try to survive.
{51679}{51741}Well, are you|more comfortable now?
{51743}{51800}Yes, are you?
{51835}{51882}Oh, yes.
{51915}{52019}You know, it seems strange|being here like this after hearing|Roy rave about you for months.
{52021}{52086}Does Roy rave?|Oh, rather.|He idolizes you.
{52087}{52173}Oh, I do wish he wouldn't.|It makes me feel guilty.
{52175}{52258}I can understand|his raving now.|Oh, don't be silly.
{52303}{52349}You're not a bit|like Roy, are you?
{52351}{52424}I should say not.
{52426}{52507}Roy's frightfully high-minded.|He doesn't approve of me.
{52509}{52611}He wouldn't approve of me either|if he knew what I'm really like.
{52612}{52683}Doesn't he know?|No.
{52685}{52766}When I'm with Roy,|I'm the way Roy wants me to be.
{52767}{52844}That's caddish, isn't it?|But I can't help it.
{52846}{52907}I understand.|Roy wouldn't.
{52967}{53015}May I ask you|a very personal question?
{53017}{53095}Yes.|Do you love Roy?
{53144}{53227}No, not really.|Not the way Roy|wants me to love him.
{53229}{53313}I can't. Roy's love means|marriage and children...
{53315}{53368}and never anyone but Roy.
{53370}{53434}I couldn't bear that.|I wanna be free.
{53436}{53483}I wanna be gay|and have fun.
{53484}{53570}Life's short,|and I wanna live|while I'm alive.
{53572}{53688}I know, that...|that's the way I feel too.
{53742}{53788}I...
{53860}{53907}I think I'd better go.
{53932}{53988}Must you?|I really should.
{54022}{54068}Pull.
{55507}{55566}Cold in here now,|isn't it?
{55707}{55757}Have you a match?
{56145}{56191}Why so gloomy?
{56343}{56390}God, I'm rotten.
{56391}{56440}I can't see it.
{56471}{56556}Can't you?|Well, then you're rotten too.
{56558}{56627}What do you mean?|And Roy worships you.
{56628}{56675}You!|Well?
{56676}{56755}Don't you make yourself sick...|you and Roy.
{56756}{56817}God, that's funny.|Get out of here!
{56819}{56863}Don't worry.|I can't get out fast enough.
{56865}{56914}Get out!
{56916}{56985}{y:i}And stay out!
{57380}{57423}Where have you been?
{57471}{57552}Oh, I, uh...|I stopped at a...
{57554}{57611}at a bar|after I took Helen home.
{57612}{57676}Oh.
{57678}{57735}How'd you like her?
{57736}{57780}Oh, she's all right.
{57782}{57853}Pass in a crowd, eh?
{57855}{57934}{y:i}I daresay she would.
{57935}{57993}Just what do you mean by that?
{58044}{58097}Listen, Roy, let me tell you something.|Even if it hurts.
{58099}{58147}Yes?
{58149}{58217}I wouldn't be so idealistic|about Helen if I were you.
{58219}{58273}And why not?
{58275}{58355}Well, I...|I just wouldn't, that's all.
{58357}{58423}{y:i}Well, why not?|Oh, I don't know.|Forget it.
{58425}{58474}Never mind crawling.|Out with it.
{58507}{58554}Listen, Roy, I tell you.|Women are all the same.
{58556}{58628}You look at every woman|as a barmaid.
{58630}{58677}You don't know anything|about decent women.
{58679}{58725}Oh, all right.|You know it all then.
{58727}{58774}Oh, you've said enough.|Shut up.
{60355}{60445}Karl. Karl!
{63489}{63543}Zep overhead!
{63602}{63665}- South by east.|- Righto!
{63891}{63942}Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Right.
{63968}{64035}All lights out, sir.|Lights out, quick!
{64289}{64371}{y:i}Zeppelin overhead!|Zeppelin overhead!|Everybody out!
{64373}{64429}{y:i}Hey, come on, Monte.|Zeppelin overhead.
{64431}{64477}Come on, Monte.|What's the matter with you?|Get up.
{64479}{64543}We don't all have to go.|I'm tired.|Oh, shut up.
{64545}{64626}- Come on. Let's go.|Hurry up. Come on.|- Be right with you, Elliot.
{64627}{64680}Come on, Monte. Get up.|Come on. Let's go. Hurry.|All right.
{65670}{65736}Karl...
{66743}{66789}Karl.
{67130}{67187}{y:i}Danke.
{67710}{67776}Well, so long there, Tommy.|All right, old chap.|Good luck, Elliot.
{67813}{67859}Go get 'em, Monte.|Good-bye.
{67861}{67922}Good luck, Roy.|Right.
{71525}{71619}Perfect.
{73691}{73748}Look, Roy, there she goes.
{74043}{74104}Let's go.
{76947}{76994}{y:i}Kapitän?
{77327}{77404}{y:i}Kapitän. Kapitän!
{77602}{77674}{y:i}Kapitän! Kapitän!
{81115}{81161}{y:i}Jawohl!
{84841}{84896}Hey, Roy, they've hit our motor.
{84934}{84995}Cut the gas.|We'll burn to death!
{85122}{85181}Roy!|Oh, shut up!
{86147}{86193}Well, this is a mess, all right.
{86195}{86257}Yeah, just our luck.|Lucky we weren't both killed.
{86259}{86315}Well, we're through.
{86359}{86405}{y:i}Herr Kapitän.
{87851}{87915}Look at it, Monte.|Roy, it's falling!
{88087}{88135}Look at that, Roy.|Great, isn't it?
{88374}{88422}They're done for.
{88743}{88797}Look out! Run!
{95127}{95178}Just a minute.
{95243}{95306}Why the blazes don't you|look where you're going, sir?
{95308}{95356}I'm sorry, sir.
{95358}{95434}Isn't it customary to salute|one's superior officer?
{95459}{95534}Thank you.|What is your name, sir?|Lieutenant Roy Rutledge.
{95536}{95583}Make a note of that.|Yes, sir.
{95696}{95780}{y:i}Would you like to try it|and find out?
{95852}{95932}{y:i}They are. They glisten in the sun.
{96033}{96124}What the hell you trying to do?|It took me three hours to write that.
{96126}{96206}{y:i}You're nothing but a pest anyhow.|Sit down.|Oh, don't, Bruce.
{96207}{96315}You shouldn't smoke so many.|What difference does it make?
{96317}{96393}You know it's bad for you.|Buy a chocolate, miss.
{96460}{96568}Change, miss.|Please.
{96570}{96641}That's a good boy.|What a life it would be|married to you.
{96643}{96718}Oh, you don't fancy it?|Beastly.|No smokes.
{96720}{96781}Think of all the money we'd save.|What would we spend it on?
{96783}{96875}Oh, a diamond dog collar.|For me?
{96876}{96980}No. I'd buy a muzzle for you.|You wouldn't spoil|my beautiful mustache, would you?
{96982}{97096}No. We'd keep that|in the parlor under glass.
{97173}{97241}Hello, Helen.|Oh, hello, Roy.
{97279}{97359}Roy, I'd like you to meet|Captain Redfield. Lieutenant Rutledge.
{97361}{97437}How do you do?|How do you do?
{97439}{97495}Beastly weather.|Yes, isn't it.
{97496}{97596}- You'll get used to it.|- Thanks.
{97598}{97674}Gee, it's great to see you again, Helen.|It's been four whole days.
{97676}{97723}Really?
{97750}{97819}- Have you been over long?|- Three weeks.
{97821}{97905}Oh. Three weeks.
{97969}{98018}Everything all right|up your way?|Oh, yes.
{98020}{98096}Your squadron near here?|Twenty miles up the line.
{98098}{98198}Twenty miles. That far.
{98199}{98279}- You chaps have it rather soft,|haven't you?|- Do you think so?
{98281}{98368}Well, I mean to say being able to|dash about the countryside and all that.
{98370}{98416}Wish I'd picked the R.F.C.
{98418}{98478}Well, why didn't you?|Roy.
{98503}{98571}Well, I must be going.|Oh. Don't go.
{98635}{98686}I think I'd better.
{98719}{98811}Good-bye, Helen,|and don't forget your promise.|I won't.
{98935}{99022}Who's that bag of wind?|Would you mind not talking|about my friends like that?
{99024}{99092}Oh, now, Helen, please.|Oh, you were perfectly beastly to him.
{99094}{99206}I'm terribly sorry.|Guess my nerves are a bit raw.
{99207}{99263}Things haven't been so easy|this last week.
{99265}{99333}Oh, you've been fighting?
{99335}{99422}Did you shoot down any Boche?|Yes. I managed to get a couple.
{99424}{99486}Really? How thrilling.|Tell me about it.
{99488}{99572}Well, there's really|nothing much to tell.|Three bars of chocolate, miss.
{101142}{101242}Oh, Jymes.|Oh, Jymes. Bread, Jymes.|We want bread.
{101244}{101320}{y:i}We want bread!
{101322}{101398}Coming, sir. Coming!
{101399}{101447}{y:i}Did you ever try hurrying, Jymes?
{101449}{101529}Sorry, sir, but I stopped to dig|a few of the cockroaches out of it, sir.
{101531}{101620}Well, put it down.
{101710}{101801}Well, where's the bread?|Did you ever try hurrying, sir?
{101803}{101905}Jymes, more bread.
{101907}{101990}Drown the cockroaches this time.|Yes, sir.
{102051}{102143}Jymes, what's the taste in this soup?|I can't say, sir.
{102144}{102216}{y:i}It's not soup, it's soap.|I think it's shoe polish.
{102218}{102310}Sorry, sir. Cook said the soup|was a bit weak tonight.
{102311}{102403}Maybe you taste|the disinfectant in the water, sir.|Oh.
{102479}{102559}Well, strike me blind,|it's a hair.
{102561}{102650}{y:i}Wash it off and wear it, Baldy.
{102805}{102893}Hello, you chaps.|Hello, Monte. How goes it?
{103020}{103100}Still no news of Harry?|No.
{103102}{103166}Somebody always gets it|on the night patrol.
{103167}{103215}What do you think, Marryat?|You saw it happen.
{103217}{103293}{y:i}Is there any chance|he got down alive?
{103295}{103370}No, I don't think so.|The searchlights got him.
{103372}{103456}We were flying low and they heard us.|We started to climb, but it was too late.
{103458}{103562}Shrapnel began bursting all around him.|Two bursts caught him and he started to drop.
{103563}{103700}It was awful to see him down there,|twisting and diving... crippled,|always dropping.
{103702}{103782}Trying every way to get clear of|those lights. Then another burst got him.
{103783}{103855}We could hear him screaming...|Stop! I can't stand it.
{103857}{103937}{y:i}Good thing he took your place, Rutledge.|You might've got it instead of him.
{103939}{104026}Oh, I'll get it sooner or later.|We'll all get it.|Isn't there any end to this?
{104028}{104088}Oh, shut up.|You're always whining.|Shut up yourself.
{104090}{104150}Who'll make me?|I'll make you.
{104255}{104350}Sit down, Jack, and be quiet.|All right. What's the matter|with you fellas?
{104352}{104443}Would anybody like to take|Monte's place on tonight's patrol?
{104444}{104490}Lay off.
{104491}{104524}{y:i}No more soup.|We need some.
{104526}{104596}No more soup.|We need some soup.
{104598}{104690}{y:i}Jymes! Hurry it up.
{104691}{104787}{y:i}Splendid.
{104811}{104891}{y:i}Splendid, Jymes.
{104893}{105013}{y:i}Splendid.|That's what comes from hurrying.
{105015}{105102}What was dinner|before you dropped it, Jymes?
{105104}{105204}A tasty bit of salmon, sir.|Sewer trout again?
{105206}{105254}Hasn't the cook anything else?
{105255}{105339}Well, sir, there's that tin|of pork and beans.|No, we don't want that.
{105341}{105438}Can he do anything with the garbage?|Oh, well, never mind.|We aren't hungry, are we?
{105440}{105509}Coffee, Jymes.
{105511}{105558}{y:i}Yes, sir.|And, Jymes.
{105559}{105605}{y:i}Yes, sir?|Don't let anything hurry you.
{105607}{105661}No, sir.
{105733}{105817}{y:i}Drinking again?
{105893}{105953}You dirty louse!|Hey, Baldy.
{105955}{106043}The sooner you get shot down,|the better.|Baldy, darling.
{106045}{106156}{y:i}Now that didn't hurt, Baldy.
{106266}{106338}Monte!|What's the matter with you?|Attention.
{106398}{106445}As you were.
{106533}{106601}The following officers|will report for night patrol.
{106603}{106659}Drayton.|Yes, sir.
{106660}{106695}{y:i}Fuller.|Here, sir.
{106697}{106854}{y:i}Maloney.|Oh, no. Not an old baldheaded man|like me up there in the cold, cold air.
{106856}{106948}Perhaps Fritz|will warm it up for you.
{106950}{106995}{y:i}Neville.|Here, sir.
{106996}{107055}Monte Rutledge.
{107057}{107117}Monte Rutledge.
{107233}{107341}I don't feel very well tonight, sir.|That's all right, boy.|None of us feel well.
{107343}{107438}But you don't understand.|I think I do, Rutledge.
{107440}{107564}But I say, sir. You don't understand.|Th-There seems to be|something the matter with me.
{107566}{107630}I know what's the matter with him.|He's yellow.|Oh, shut up.
{107631}{107699}Oh, let's say it.|Didn't Harry go west last night|because he took this man's place?
{107701}{107738}Keep quiet, Jack.|I will not keep quiet.
{107740}{107832}{y:i}He's yellow and we all know it.|That's a lie!|I'm not yellow.
{107834}{107930}I can see things as they are, that's all.|I'm sick of this rotten business.
{107931}{107987}You fools. Why do you|let them kill you like this?
{107989}{108105}What are you fighting for?|Patriotism. Duty. Are you mad?
{108107}{108238}Can't you see they're just words?|Words coined by politicians and profiteers|to trick you into fighting for them.
{108240}{108332}What's a word compared with life...|the only life you've got.
{108334}{108446}I'll give 'em a word. Murder!|That's what this dirty rotten|politician's war is.
{108447}{108535}Murder! You know it as well as I do.|Yellow, am I?
{108537}{108605}You're the ones that are yellow.|I've got guts to say what I think.
{108607}{108717}You're afraid to say it.|So afraid to be called yellow,|you'd rather be killed first.
{108719}{108802}You fools! You poor, stupid fools.
{108804}{108891}Oh, Monte.|Now, pull yourself together, will ya?
{108893}{108957}Stand up, Rutledge!
{108959}{109075}I've taken a lot of shirking from you|since we came out here,|but this is a bit too much.
{109076}{109141}Sir, he really is ill.|You're a disgrace to your squadron.|Go to your quarters.
{109143}{109190}Yes, sir.
{109673}{109733}Have a cigarette.
{109735}{109798}You don't think I'm yellow,|do you, Roy?
{109800}{109892}Why, of course not.|You're just more sensitive|than the rest of us.
{109894}{109966}I wonder.|Well, stop thinking about it.
{109967}{110023}I wish I could.
{110025}{110101}Haven't I been up twice|on the night patrol?|I'm trying to do my share.
{110103}{110154}Of course you are now.
{110156}{110232}You... You must be pretty well|fed up with me after all this.
{110234}{110334}Oh, that's rot.|I- I'm not yellow.
{110335}{110407}I'm not!|Oh, now, Monte.|Come on. Pull yourself together.
{110519}{110570}Staff Colonel.|Everybody out.
{110595}{110663}Come on, Monte.
{110664}{110718}Stand easy.
{110821}{110953}Well, men, I don't like|what I have to say, but let's face it,
{110955}{111038}you all know|the central munition dump at Spraug.
{111040}{111109}You've tried three times|to bomb that depot without success.
{111111}{111183}{y:i}No fault of yours, of course,|they've guarded it too closely.
{111219}{111315}That munition depot at Spraug|must be destroyed tomorrow morning.
{111339}{111446}Now, then, today a German bombing plane|was forced down within our lines.
{111448}{111533}{y:i}We were lucky enough to capture it|before they had a chance to destroy it.
{111535}{111598}We've fixed it up so it'll fly.
{111600}{111696}We want to use this plane|to bomb the Spraug depot.
{111698}{111770}There's no question that|the venture will succeed this time.
{111771}{111867}The enemy won't suspect|one of their own planes|until after the depot is bombed.
{111869}{111912}Then when they discover the trick,
{111914}{112006}{y:i}well, you... you may have|a little difficulty in getting back.
{112074}{112150}{y:i}I need two men to fly this plane.
{112198}{112254}I'll go, sir.|Are you sure you wanna go?
{112255}{112294}Quite sure, sir.|Very well.
{112295}{112346}I'll go with him, sir.
{112348}{112434}Who are these men?|Lieutenants Monte|and Roy Rutledge, sir.
{112436}{112528}Brothers, eh?|Dismissed.
{112576}{112627}Now, young men,
{112683}{112759}I want you to realize|how important this is.
{112761}{112881}The Seventh Brigade has been ordered|to go over the top in a surprise attack|tomorrow evening at dusk.
{112905}{112997}The brigade doesn't know it,|but I- I'm afraid they're|going to be slaughtered.
{112999}{113055}There's too much artillery|in front of us.
{113056}{113115}If you destroy that munition depot|early tomorrow morning,
{113117}{113197}it will weaken the enemy artillery,|and we may be able to get through.
{113199}{113286}Hundreds of lives|depend on you.
{113288}{113336}Do you understand?|Yes, sir.|Yes, sir.
{113338}{113410}Now, another thing.|The plane you are to fly...
{113411}{113499}is far too dangerous|a piece of armament|to let the enemy recapture it.
{113501}{113573}It must return|or be destroyed.
{113575}{113650}If you were captured,|you'd be shot as spies anyway.
{113652}{113699}Baldy. Oh, Baldy?
{113700}{113800}{y:i}You'll take the morning patrol|in towards Spraug as far as you can.
{113802}{113854}{y:i}You might possibly help them|get back.|By all means.
{113855}{113906}Yes, sir.
{113908}{113984}You'll get your maps|and final instructions|just before taking off.
{113986}{114075}Report to the field at 3:00 a. m.|Until then, let them do as they please.
{114077}{114129}- Yes, sir. 3:00, you two.|- Yes, sir.
{114131}{114182}Good luck.|Thank you, sir.
{114183}{114231}Thank you, sir.
{114391}{114467}- What time is it, Monte?|- Ten past 9:00.
{114469}{114549}{y:i}Helen's canteen closes at 10:00.|We’ve just enough time to get there.
{114551}{114640}- Do you think they'll|let us have the motorcycle?|- Why, of course. We're "it" tonight.
{114642}{114704}Yeah. We're "it" all right.
{114763}{114826}Not sorry, are you?|Oh, let's not talk about it.
{114828}{114908}I'm not even gonna|think about it until 3:00.
{114910}{114970}What's your program?|Wine, women and song?
{114971}{115043}{y:i}Oh, perhaps I'll do without|the song tonight.
{115459}{115539}- See you at Grosson's?|- Either there or at Jacques|across the street.
{115540}{115614}- Wherever you hear the most noise.|- Don't you wanna come in with me|to see Helen?
{115616}{115715}Oh, I better not.|Righto.
{115780}{115856}Where's Helen?
{115858}{115942}She's gone out.|Oh.
{115943}{116027}Was she expecting you?|No.
{116029}{116097}Would you care|to leave a note?
{116099}{116146}Yes, I think I will.
{116148}{116236}Pen and ink on the table.
{117896}{117980}You'll see that she gets this?|Oh, yes.
{117982}{118096}Thank you. Good night.|Good night.
{118546}{118638}Hello. What's up?|She isn't in.
{118662}{118750}That's tough.|Wanna come along with me?
{118751}{118807}Where to?|Grosson's.
{118809}{118843}Righto.
{118898}{118982}Your switch on?
Call off your ungodly dogs!
Down!
Quiet! Down!
Are you Mr. Heathcliff?
Well, I'm Mr. Lockwood, your new tenant at the Grange.
I'm lost. I--
Can I get a guide from amongst your lads?
No, you cannot. I've only got one, and he's needed here.
Well, then, I'll have to stay till morning.
Do as you please.
Quiet! Down!
Thank you for your hospitality.
Could you extend it to a cup of tea?
- Shall I?
- You heard him ask for it.
Thank you.
I presume the amiable lady is Mrs. Heathcliff?
Would it be taxing your remarkable hospitality if I sat down?
I hope my hospitality will teach you... not to make rash journeys on these moors.
As for staying here, I don't keep accommodations for visitors.
You can share a bed with one of the servants.
Thanks. I'll sleep in a chair, sir.
No. A stranger is a stranger.
Guests are so rare in this house that I hardly know how to receive them.
I and my dog.
Joseph, open up one of the upstairs rooms.
Here's a room for thee, sir.
Bridal chamber.
Nobody slept here for years.
It's a trifle depressing.
- Can you light a fire?
- No fire will burn in yonder grate.
Chimbley's all blocked up.
Very well. Thanks.
Good night.
I said good night.
Heathcliff!
Let me in!
I'm lost on the moors!
- It's Cathy!
- Help! Mr. Heathcliff!
There's somebody out!
Oh, Mr. Heathcliff!
There's someone out there.
It's a woman. I heard her calling.
She said her name.
Cathy. That was it!
Cathy?
Oh, I must have been dreaming.
Forgive me.
Get out of this room.
Get out!
Get out, I tell you!
Cathy! Come in!
Cathy, come back to me.
Oh, do come once more.
Oh, my heart's darling!
Cathy. My own--
My--
Where's he going in the storm?
She calls him... and he follows her out onto the moor.
He's mad! He's like a madman.
He seized me by the collar and flung me out.
You see, I had a dream.
I thought I heard a voice calling.
I reached out to close the shutter, and something touched me.
Something cold and clinging, like an icy hand.
And then I saw her.
A woman.
Then my senses must have become disordered because the falling snow... shaped itself into what looked like a phantom, but there was nothing.
It was Cathy.
Who is Cathy?
A girl who died.
Oh, no, I don't believe in ghosts.
I don't believe in phantoms sobbing through the night.
- Poor Cathy.
- I don't believe life comes back... once it's died and calls again to the living.
No, I don't.
Maybe if I told you her story, you'd change your mind... about the dead coming back.
Maybe you'd know, as I do... that there is a force that brings them back... if their hearts were wild enough in life.
Tell me her story.
It began 40 years ago... when I was young... in the service of Mr. Earnshaw...
Cathy's father.
Cathy's father.
Wuthering Heights was a lovely place in those days... full of summertime and youth and happy voices.
One day Mr. Earnshaw was returning from a visit to Liverpool.
- You'll not catch me!
- Yes, I will!
Cathy, go wash! I don't want your father to see you in that dress.
You too, Hindley.
Hurry up, now.
I don't want to get washed!
Come along! I'll tell your father not to give you the present he's bringing.
- What's he bringing?
- Go along upstairs.
Joseph says his horse is coming over the hill.
Evening, Mr. Earnshaw.
- Hello, Joseph.
- Hello, neighbor Earnshaw.
- How are you, Dr. Kenneth?
- Back so soon?
What in the world have you got there?
A gift of God.
Although it's as dark as if he came from the devil.
- Quiet, me bonny lad, we're home.
- He's a dour-looking individual.
Aye, and with reason.
I found him starving in Liverpool... kicked and bruised and almost dead.
So you kidnapped him.
Not until I spent two pounds trying to find out who its owner was.
But nobody would claim him, so I brought him home.
- Giddap!
- Here, here!
Come on, you young imp of Satan.
Off with ye.
- Cathy, Hindley!
- Welcome home. The children are coming.
Don't look so shocked, Ellen.
He's going to live with us for a while.
Give him a good scrubbing... and put some Christian clothes on him.
Food is what he needs most,
Mr. Earnshaw.
He's as thin as a sparrow.
Come into the kitchen, child.
Cathy! Hindley!
- Father, what did you bring me?
- Hello, Father!
There you are.
It's what you've always wanted.
A riding crop.
Be careful how you use it.
- Oh, it's wonderful!
- I'm so glad you got back soon.
- It's wonderful!
- Ow! Father, make her stop!
No, children.
This is Hindley's violin.
One of the best in Liverpool.
Here. Fine tone.
And a bow to go with it.
Here you are, Paganini.
Who's that?
- He was hungry as a wolf.
- Oh, children.
This is a little gentleman I met in Liverpool who will pay us a visit.
He-- He's dirty.
Oh, no. Don't make me ashamed of you, Cathy.
When he's been scrubbed, show him Hindley's room.
- He'll sleep there.
- In my room?
He can't. I won't let him.
Children, you may as well learn now that you must share what you have... with others not as fortunate as yourselves.
- Take charge of the lad, Ellen.
- Come along, child.
What's your name?
We'll call him Heathcliff.
Heathcliff, I'll race you to the barn.
The loser has to be the slave.
Come on!
Faster!
Come on!
Whoa. I won!
You're my slave! You have to do as I say. Water my horse and groom it!
Oh, that's not fair!
It's too real.
- What do you want?
- This horse.
- You can't have him. He's mine!
- Mine's lame. I'm riding yours.
Give him to me or I'll tell Father you boasted you'd turn me out when he died!
That's a lie!
I never said such a thing.
- He didn't!
- You never had a father!
You gypsy beggar!
You can't have mine!
Stop that!
- Heathcliff, look out!
- Don't come near me!
Let him go!
You killed him!
I'm going to tell Father.
He'll punish you for this.
You can't go near him till he's well.
- You heard Dr. Kenneth!
- Are you hurt badly?
Talk to me.
Why don't you cry?
Heathcliff, don't look like that!
How can I pay him back?
I don't care how long I wait... if I can only pay him back.
Come. Let's pick harebells on Penistone Crag.
You can ride Jane.
Please, milord?
- Oh, Heathcliff.
- Whoa, Jane.
- You're so handsome when you smile.
- Don't make fun of me.
Don't you know that you're handsome?
Do you know what I've told Ellen?
- You're a prince in disguise.
- You did?
I said your father was the emperor of
China and your mother an Indian queen.
It's true, Heathcliff.
You were kidnapped by wicked sailors and brought to England.
But I'm glad. I've always wanted to know somebody of noble birth.
All the princes I ever read about had castles.
Of course. They captured them.
You must capture one too.
There's a beautiful castle that lies waiting for your lance, Sir Prince.
You mean Penistone Crag?
Aw, that's just a rock.
If you can't see that's a castle, you'll never be a prince.
Here, take your lance and charge!
See that black knight at the drawbridge?
Challenge him!
Charge!
I challenge you to mortal combat,
Black Knight!
Heathcliff! You've killed him!
You've killed the black knight!
He's earned it for all his wicked deeds.
Oh, it's a wonderful castle.
- Heathcliff, let's never leave it.
- Never in our lives!
Let all the world confess, there is not a more beautiful damsel... than the Princess Catherine of Yorkshire.
But I'm still your slave.
No, Cathy.
I now make you my queen.
Whatever happens out there, here you will always be my queen.
How is he, Doctor?
He is at peace.
Send for the vicar, Joseph.
My dear, wild little Cathy.
You may come up and pray beside him now.
You're not wanted up there.
My father is past your wheedling.
Go and help the stable boys harness the horse for the vicar.
Do as you're told.
I'm master here now.
And as the children grew up, Hindley was indeed master of Wuthering Heights.
It was no longer the happy home of their childhood.
- Joseph, bring me another bottle.
- That's the third, Mr. Hindley.
The third or the twenty-third, bring me another.
Wine is a mocker.
Strong drink is raging, Master Hindley.
Stop spouting scripture and do as you're told, you croaking old parrot.
Yes, Master Hindley.
Sit down, Cathy, till you're excused from the table.
Joseph, fill Miss Cathy's glass.
Oh, my little sister disapproves of drinking.
Well, I know some people who don't.
Heathcliff, saddle my horse.
Be quick about it, you gypsy beggar.
I told you to be quick.
Look at this stable. It's a pigsty.
Is this the way you do your work?
Clean it up. I want this floor cleaned and scrubbed tonight.
Don't stand there showing your teeth.
Give me a hand up.
I want your work done when I come back at dawn, do you hear?
Oh, you're hoping I won't come back.
You're hoping I'll fall and break my neck, aren't you?
Aren't you?
Well, come on, Heathcliff.
Heathcliff, where are you going?
Come back!
- Did Joseph see which way you came?
- What does it matter?
Nothing's real down there.
Our life is here.
Yes, milord.
The clouds are lowering over Gimmerton Head.
See how the light is changing?
It would be dreadful if Hindley ever found out.
Found out what?
That you talk to me once in a while?
I shouldn't talk to you at all.
Look at you!
You get worse every day.
Dirty and unkempt and in rags.
Why aren't you a man?
Heathcliff, why don't you run away?
Run away? From you?
You could come back rich and take me away.
Why aren't you my prince like we said long ago?
- Why can't you rescue me?
- Come with me now.
- Where?
- Anywhere!
And live in haystacks and steal our food from the marketplaces?
No. That's not what I want.
You just want to send me off.
That won't do.
I've stayed here and been beaten like a dog.
Abused and cursed and driven mad, but I stayed just to be near you.
Even as a dog! I'll stay till the end.
I'll live and I'll die under this rock.
Do you hear?
Music.
The Lintons are giving a party.
That's what I want.
Dancing and singing in a pretty world.
And I'm going to have it.
Come on. Let's go and see.
Come on!
Isn't it wonderful?
Isn't she beautiful?
That's the kind of dress I'll wear.
You'll have a red velvet coat with silver buckles on your shoes.
Oh, will we ever?
Quick.
- Hold him, Skulker, Flash!
- Call off your dogs, you fools!
Stay where you are.
There's nothing to be alarmed about.
- Who is it?
- I don't know.
Please, back into the ballroom.
- Let me go!
- Hold that man.
Hold onto him!
- Who is it Edgar?
- Catherine Earnshaw, Father.
- Who's this with her?
- Their stable boy.
She's bleeding. Bring hot water,
Isabella, and bandages.
- Yes. How badly is she hurt?
- Can't tell.
Send Robert to get Dr. Kenneth in the shay. Hurry.
- You'll pay for this!
- Hold your tongue, insolent rascal!
- Get out of this house.
- I won't go without Cathy.
Father, please, she's in pain.
Go on. Run away.
Bring me back the world.
- Pack this fellow off.
- I'm going.
I'm going from here and from this cursed country both.
Throw him out!
But I'll be back in this house one day,
Judge Linton. I'll pay you out.
I'll bring this house down in ruins about your heads.
That's my curse on you!
On all of you!
And so Cathy found herself in this new world... she had so often longed to enter.
After some happy weeks, Mr. Edgar brought her back to Wuthering Heights.
Welcome home, Miss Cathy!
How do you do, Mr. Linton?
Don't stir!
I'll get Joseph to carry you.
Carry her?
She runs like a little goat.
Ellen, I've been dancing, night after night!
Oh, how beautiful you look! Wherever did you get that beautiful dress?
Mr. Linton's sister lent it to me.
Isn't it wonderful?
Edgar, do come in for tea.
As soon as the horses have been seen to.
I'll find someone.
Is he here?
He came back last week with great talk... of lying in a lake of fire without you-- how he had to see you to live.
He's unbearable.
Where could he be, the scoundrel?
Why did you stay so long in that house?
I didn't expect to find you here.
Why did you stay so long?
Why? Because I was having a wonderful time.
A delightful, fascinating, wonderful time... among human beings.
Go and wash your face and hands, and comb your hair... so that I needn't be ashamed of you in front of a guest.
What are you doing in this part of the house? Look after Mr. Linton's horses.
Let him look after his own.
- I've already done so.
- Apologize to Mr. Linton at once.
Bring in some tea, please.
- Cathy.
- Yes, Edgar?
I cannot understand how your brother can allow that gypsy in the house.
Don't talk about him.
How can you, a gentlewoman, tolerate him under your roof?
A roadside beggar giving himself airs of equality. How can you?
What do you know about Heathcliff?
- All I need or want to know.
- He was my friend long before you.
- That blackguard?
- Blackguard and all, he belongs here.
Speak well of him or get out!
- Are you out of your senses?
- Stop calling those I love names!
Those you love?
Cathy, what possesses you?
Do you realize the things you're saying?
I'm saying that I hate you.
I hate the look of your milk-white face.
I hate the touch of your soft, foolish hands.
That gypsy's evil soul has got into you.
- Yes, it's true!
- That beggar's dirt is on you!
Yes! Now get out!
My dear.
Leave me alone.
Forgive me, Heathcliff.
Make the world stop right here.
Make everything stop and stand still and never move again.
Make the moors never change and you and I never change.
The moors and I will never change.
- Don't you, Cathy.
- I can't.
No matter what I ever do or say, this is me now.
Standing on this hill with you.
This is me forever.
Come.
When you went away, what did you do?
Where did you go?
I went to Liverpool.
One night I shipped for America on a brigantine going to New Orleans.
We were held up by the tide, and I lay all night on the deck... thinking of you and the years and years ahead without you.
I jumped overboard and swam ashore.
I think I'd have died if you hadn't.
You're not thinking of that other world now.
Smell the heather.
Fill my arms with heather.
All they can hold.
Come on.
You're still my queen!
And as time went by...
Cathy again was torn between her wild, uncontrollable passion for Heathcliff... and the new life she had found at the Grange... that she could not forget.
I got the soap in my eyes!
Where's the towel?
- Oh, it's hot!
- No, it's just--
- It's hot!
- Don't do that!
Ellen, haven't you finished yet?
Supposing you're not ready when he gets here. Keep still.
Any young man that will come sniveling back after the way you treated him... you can keep waiting forever.
What's wrong with him, sending you perfume? Hasn't he any pride?
I sent my apologies, didn't I?
I can't believe this change in you,
Miss Cathy.
Yesterday you were a harum-scarum child with dirty hands and a willful heart.
Look at you.
Oh, you're lovely, Miss Cathy.
Lovely.
That's a very silly lie.
I'm not lovely.
What I am is very brilliant.
- I have a wonderful brain.
- Indeed?
It enables me to be superior to myself.
There's nothing to be gained by just looking pretty like Isabella.
Every beauty mark must conceal a thought and every curl be full of humor... as well as brilliantine. as well as brilliantine.
Such prattle. We--
Since when are you in the habit of entering my room, Heathcliff?
I want to talk to you.
Go outside, Ellen.
I will not! I take orders from
Mistress Catherine, not stable boys.
Go outside.
All right, Ellen.
Now that we're so happily alone, may I know to what I owe this great honor?
- He's coming here again.
- You're utterly unbearable.
You didn't think so this morning on the moors.
- Well, my moods change indoors.
- Is he coming here?
- Of course not. Please go away.
- You're lying!
Why are you dressed up in a silk dress?
Because gentlefolk dress for dinner.
Not you. Why are you trying to win his puling flatteries?
I'm not a child.
You can't talk like that to me.
I'm not talking to a child.
I'm talking to my Cathy.
- Oh, I'm your Cathy?
- Yes!
I'm to take your orders and allow you to select my dresses?
You're not gonna simper in front of him, listening to his silly talk!
I'm not?
Well, I am. It's more entertaining that listening to a stable boy.
- Don't you talk like that.
- I will. Go away.
This is my room, a lady's room, not a room for servants with dirty hands.
Let me alone!
Yes.
Tell the dirty stable boy to let go of you.
He soils your pretty dress.
But who soils your heart?
Not Heathcliff!
Who turns you into a vain, cheap, worldly fool? Linton does!
You'll never love him, but you'll let yourself be loved to please your vanity.
Loved by that milksop with buckles on his shoes!
Stop it and get out!
You had your chance to be something else.
But thief or servant were all you were born to be, or beggar beside a road.
Not earning favors, but whimpering for them with your dirty hands!
That's all I've become to you: a pair of dirty hands.
Well, have them then!
Have them where they belong!
It doesn't help to strike you.
Good evening, Ellen.
I hope I'm not too early.
- Miss Cathy will be down in a minute.
- Thanks.
If you'll go into the parlor,
I'll tell Miss Cathy you're here.
Half past eight.
Unholy hour.
Doesn't he know, young fool, when it's time to go home?
That's Mr. Edgar now.
Go and fetch his horse.
- Take these apples into the larder.
- Yea, Lord.
Spare the righteous and smite the ungodly.
Stop your pratter.
- Good night, Joseph.
- Good night, sir.
Has he gone?
Your hands! What have you done?
Linton. Is he gone?
What have you done to your hands?
What have you been doing?
I want to crawl to her feet, whimper to be forgiven... for loving me, for needing her more than my own life... for belonging to her more than my own soul.
Don't let her see me.
I wondered whether you were still up.
I have some news!
The kitchen is no place for that.
Come into the parlor.
Come here.
Sit down. Listen!
Can you keep a secret?
Edgar's asked me to marry him.
- What did you tell him?
- That I'd give him my answer tomorrow.
Do you love him, Miss Cathy?
- Yes! Of course.
- Why?
Why? That's a silly question, isn't it?
No, not so silly.
Why do you love him?
He's handsome and pleasant to be with.
- That's not enough.
- Because he'll be rich someday.
I'll be the finest lady in the county.
Now tell me how you love him.
I love the ground under his feet, the air above his head... and everything he touches.
What about Heathcliff?
Oh, Heathcliff.
He gets worse every day.
It would degrade me to marry him.
I wish he hadn't come back.
It would be heaven to escape from this disorderly, comfortless place.
Well, if Master Edgar and his charms and money...
Well, if Master Edgar and his charms and money... and parties mean heaven to you... what's to keep you from taking your place among the Linton angels?
I don't think I belong in heaven.
I dreamt once I was there.
I dreamt I went to heaven, and it didn't seem to be my home.
I broke my heart with weeping to come back to earth.
The angels were so angry, they flung me out in the middle of the heath... on top of Wuthering Heights.
I woke up sobbing with joy.
That's it, Ellen!
I have no more business marrying Edgar than I have of being in heaven.
But Ellen, what can I do?
You're thinking of Heathcliff.
Who else?
He's sunk so low. He seems to take pleasure in being brutal.
And yet... he's more myself than I am.
Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same.
Linton's is as different as frost from fire.
My one thought in living is Heathcliff.
I am Heathcliff.
Everything he's suffered,
I've suffered.
The little happiness he's ever known,
I've had too.
If everything died and Heathcliff remained... life would still be full for me.
Hey, Heathcliff!
Where's thee going?
Heathcliff!
Come back!
He must have been listening.
- Listening to us?
- Yes.
Where?
How much did he hear?
I'm not sure, but I think... to where you said it would degrade you to marry him.
There's no use in calling.
He's run away on master's best horse.
Come out of this storm!
You'll catch your death of cold!
- He won't come back!
- Last time he did!
This time he won't.
I know him.
- Which way did he go, Joseph?
- Yonder. Right on west moor.
- Come in! You must come in.
- The fool.
He should have known
I love him. I love him!
Heathcliff, come back!
- Thank heaven you've come home!
- I told Joseph to stay awake!
- Do I unsaddle my own horse?
- You've got to go out again!
Miss Cathy's gone! They're looking for her-- Joseph, everybody!
- Gone where?
- Out in the storm, hours ago.
Heathcliff ran away. He took a horse, and she went running after him.
- Oh, she did?
- Yes.
Don't stand there with your mouth open.
Fetch me a bottle and we'll celebrate.
Master Hindley, she'll die on the moors.
- You've got to help.
- Do as I tell you!
If she's gone off with that gypsy scum, let her run.
Let her run through storm and hell.
They're birds of a feather.
The devil can take them both.
Get me a bottle.
- Take her into the library.
- Get a fire in the east room.
And some brandy.
Turn this around to the fire.
- The brandy, Miss Isabella.
- Get some dry towels. Quickly.
- Where was she?
- The rocks on Penistone Crag... the life almost out of her.
Twenty drops in a glass of claret, well warmed.
Then add a lump of sugar.
There's nothing else I can tell you... except keep her in the sun and give her plenty of cream and butter.
In another month you'll be feeling like new.
- Good-bye, dear.
- Good-bye, Dr. Kenneth.
She'll be going home soon, Doctor.
What's needed is peace and orderliness in her life.
That's not to be found at Wuthering Heights.
- Has she mentioned him at all?
- Not since the delirium passed.
Sometimes fever can heal as well as destroy.
I made some inquiries in the village of the people who knew him.
- What did you hear?
- No sign nor hint of Heathcliff.
- He's disappeared into thin air.
- Heaven hope.
"...days and yon pursuits."
- Hello, Edgar.
- Isabella. How's our invalid?
- Much better I think.
- Let me have a look at her.
Where have you been all day?
I've missed you.
Oh, this time of year every tenant has something to complain about.
I've been arguing with old Swithin... whether we'd build him a new pigsty.
Yes?
He decided we should.
I saw Hindley in the village this afternoon.
He wanted to know when you'll be coming home.
I wasn't very truthful. I told him
Dr. Kenneth said it would be months.
Give me that.
It's time for her medicine.
What did Dr. Kenneth say?
Twenty lumps of sugar in a glass--
No. I'll go and ask Ellen.
Yes. Go and ask Ellen.
She's such a darling.
But you've all been so nice to me.
That's all I think about, how nice you are to me.
But still, I can't stay here forever.
Why not, Cathy... if I can make you happy?
You have made me happy, Edgar.
You've given me so much of your own self, your strength.
Darling, let me take care of you forever.
Let me guard you and love you always.
Would you love me always?
Yes.
It's so easy to love you.
Because I'm no longer wild and blackhearted and full of gypsy ways?
- No. I--
- Of course you were right, Edgar.
What you said long ago was true.
There was a strange curse on me.
Something that kept me from being myself.
Or at least from being what I wanted to be-- living in heaven.
How sweet you are.
I've never kissed you.
No one will ever kiss me again but you.
No one.
I'll be your wife and be proud of being your wife.
I'll be good to you and love you truly, always.
White heather for good luck,
Miss Catherine.
Come along, Cathy.
What is it?
A cold wind went across my heart just then-- a feeling of doom.
You touched me, and it was gone.
Oh, it's nothing, darling,
I'm sure.
Oh, Edgar, I love you. I do.
Good-bye.
And I, too, felt a cold wind across my heart as they rode away together.
And I, too, felt a cold wind across my heart as they rode away together.
But as the years went on, they were really in possession... of a deep and growing happiness.
I wish you could've seen Miss Cathy then.
She became quite the lady of the manor and was almost overfond of Mr. Linton.
For Isabella, she showed great affection... and presided over Thrushcross Grange... with quiet dignity.
It looks as though you've fallen into a trap, Father.
Yes, it does, doesn't it?
There you are.
Checkmate.
- Thank you, Father.
- Well, I'll go and dress for dinner.
What's wrong with the dogs?
Probably a servant coming back from the village.
I talked to Jeff Peters this afternoon about that new wing of ours.
It doesn't look as though we'll marry Isabella off for another decade.
It's a brother's duty to introduce your sister to some other type... than fops and pale young poets.
- You want a dragoon?
- Yes, I do. With a fiery mustache.
Poor Isabella. I'm afraid I got the only prize in the county.
Thank you, darling.
For me, heaven is bounded... by the four walls of this room.
Yes, we're all angels, even my little petit point hero.
I'm just putting wings on him.
Speaking of wings,
I'll show you those plans.
- Miss Cathy?
- What is it?
Someone wishes to see you.
- You sound as if it were a ghost.
- It is. He's come back.
Who?
- What does he want?
- He wants to see you.
Tell him-- Tell him
I'm not at home.
Not at home, Cathy?
To whom are you not at home?
It's Heathcliff.
Seems he's come back.
Well, that's news.
Where has he been?
America, he said. He's so changed
I hardly recognized him.
- For the better, I hope.
- Oh, yes. He's quite the gentlemen.
- Fine clothes, a horse.
- Go tell him I don't wish to see him.
Oh, nonsense, Cathy.
We can't be as cruel as that.
He's come a long way, and he's a fine gentleman, so Ellen says.
Let's see how America's managed to make a silk purse out of Master Heathcliff.
- Show him in.
- Yes, Master Edgar.
It's chilly.
Why be nervous?
The past is dead.
It's nonsense to tremble before a little ghost who returns-- a dead leaf blowing around your feet.
Darling... you may smile at him without fear of offending me.
It's my wife who smiles-- my wife who loves me.
Yes.
I was silly.
Thank you, Edgar.
Well, Heathcliff.
- Mr. Linton.
- How are you?
Hello, Cathy.
- I remember this room.
- Come in. Sit by the fire.
Have a whiskey?
No, thank you.
I've never seen such a change in a man.
I wouldn't have known you.
You seem to have prospered since our last meeting.
Somewhat.
Ellen said you'd been to America.
Yes.
We all wondered where you went.
Have you met my sister, Miss Linton?
What brought about this amazing transformation?
Did you discover a gold mine in the New World... or inherit a fortune?
The truth is, I remembered that my father was an emperor of China... and my mother was an Indian queen... and I went out and claimed my inheritance.
It all turned out just as you once suspected, Cathy... that I had been kidnapped by wicked sailors and brought to England.
That I was of noble birth.
Are you visiting here long?
I mean, in the village?
The rest of my life.
I've just bought Wuthering Heights-- the house, the stock and the moors.
Hindley has sold you the estate?
He's not aware of it as yet.
I'm afraid it'll be somewhat of a surprise when he finds... his gambling debts and liquor bills paid off by his former stable boy.
Perhaps he will merely laugh at the irony of it.
I don't understand how this could've happened... without Mrs. Linton hearing of it.
Modesty compelled me to play the Good Samaritan in secret.
By heaven. This is the most underhanded piece of work I've ever heard of.
If I'd only known. I knew Hindley had financial difficulties... but not that his property was being stolen from him by a stranger.
I'm neither thief nor stranger.
Merely your neighbor, sir.
- Now I'll say good night.
- Wait, Heathcliff.
Edgar and I have many neighbors whom we receive with hospitality and friendship.
If you are to be one of them, you're welcome to visit our house... but not with a scowl on your face or an old bitterness in your heart.
Thank you.
It occurs to me that I have not congratulated you on your marriage.
I've often thought of it.
Allow me to express my delight over your happiness now.
Good night.
- I think you behaved abominably.
- What?
You, too, Cathy. I'm dreadfully disappointed in both of you.
- What are you talking about?
- You could have been civil to him.
I conducted myself perfectly, and so did Cathy.
- You dismissed him like a servant.
- And you thought him otherwise?
- I thought him distinguished.
- I hope I misunderstood you.
It's impossible my sister could think of Heathcliff... as anything but a surly, dressed-up beggar, a lout and a boor.
I shall make sure that you never see him again.
Now go to dinner.
Joseph.
Yes, Master Hindley?
- Where's the key?
- Is it in the door?
No, and I want it. He's left, and it's our chance. I'll lock him out this time.
If he tries to get in,
I'll kill him.
Find that key, and bring me a bottle of wine.
- You've had a bad night.
- A bad night, you call it?
How can I stay sober with that vulture's beak inside me?
He stabbed me in the dark.
He robbed me of my home and gold.
- Where's the wine?
- Dr. Kenneth has forbid it.
- Blast Dr. Kenneth!
- Get him what he wants.
Dr. Kenneth has forbid it.
What difference to the world whether he's drunk or sober?
Or to Dr. Kenneth?
Do as I tell you.
Get out.
It's too early in the morning to look on the devil.
Your ingratitude makes me almost sad.
All I have done to you is to enable you to be yourself.
My money has helped you drink and gamble and enjoy the world as you wished.
Now that you're without a home
I remember that you gave me... a place to sleep when you might've turned me out.
I allow you to remain... and even provide you with solace... against the doctor's orders.
I'll have Wuthering Heights back.
I'll be master here, and I'll turn you out as I should have done years ago.
We're just in time, Joseph.
Mr. Hindley is beginning to whine and stutter.
He needs fire in his veins-- a little courage with which to face his unhappy life.
I'll have my gold, and I'll have your blood, and hell can have your soul!
Laugh now, Heathcliff.
There's no laughter in hell.
All you have to do is to shoot.
They'll thank me for it.
The world will say I did right ridding it of a rotten gypsy beggar!
Yes! They'll say that.
Shoot, and you'll be master here again.
The whole county will resound with your courage.
Go on, shoot, you puling chicken of a man... with not enough blood in you to keep your hand steady!
You remember that time you hit me with a rock?
The times you shamed and flogged me as your stable boy?
You were a coward then, and you're a coward now.
Take him out.
Find someplace for him to sleep.
Aye. I'll put him to bed.
Not in the master's room.
I'm master here now.
- His pistol.
- Aye. I'll hide it.
A gentleman must not be deprived of his weapons.
I prefer that he have it by him always as a reminder of his cowardice.
- Master Heathcliff.
- What is it?
- A lady to see you.
- A lady? From where?
The Grange, sir.
The Grange?
Why didn't you tell me?
Out of my way.
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
Not at all.
I was riding behind the Heights on the moors, and my horse went lame.
- And you brought him here.
- Yes.
That was very wise.
Shall we look at the animal?
That isn't necessary.
I've put him in the stables.
He's being taken care of.
I see.
Won't you come in?
Get on with your work.
I was furious with my brother, and Cathy too. I told them so.
I thought they acted most shamefully.
Let me give you a chair.
Your brother didn't send you with these apologies?
Oh, no. He's forbidden me to--
To speak to me?
Yes.
And Mrs. Linton?
She's also very angry with you.
So in all the county you are my only friend.
I would like to be.
Well, let us celebrate our new friendship by a gallop over the moors.
Oh, but my horse is lame.
My dear, your horse is not lame, and it never was.
You came to see me because you are lonely... because it is lonely sitting like an outsider... in so happy a house as your brother's-- lonely riding on the moors with no one at your side.
You won't be lonely anymore.
Good evening, sir.
Good evening, Ellen.
I was afraid you wouldn't come. Tonight would've been ruined if you hadn't.
Good heavens.
Is that Heathcliff?
Yes, it is.
I can't believe it.
Cathy having him here--
Not Cathy. It's my sister.
It's just a young girl's fancy, but one must not inflame it... with too much opposition, but let it spend itself harmlessly in a few dances.
Madam Eilers is going to play the harpsichord. Come and sit down.
I shall let you hold my hand underneath my fan.
Thank you very much.
Oh, it's a waltz.
Heathcliff, will you?
You see, we can hold each other, and no one can object... because that's the way it's danced.
That's the way gypsies dance.
I'm surprised to see such abandoned ways creep into so fine a house.
Father used to say it'd undermine the whole of society... and turn us into profligates.
- May I have the pleasure?
- Thank you, but I don't think I can.
Nonsense. Let me see you waltz.
- Will you watch me?
- Of course.
I'm ready.
You're not dancing this dance.
Thank you. I'm nearly exhausted.
Will the moonlight and a breath of air refresh you?
Always.
Excuse me, please.
Are you enjoying yourself,
Heathcliff?
I've had the pleasure of watching you.
You're very grand, Heathcliff.
So handsome.
Looking at you tonight I could not help but remember how things used to be.
They used to be better.
Don't pretend life hasn't improved for you.
Life has ended for me.
How can you stand here beside me and pretend not to remember?
Not to know that my heart is breaking for you?
That your face is the wonderful light burning in all this darkness?
Heathcliff, no.
I forbid it.
You forbid what your heart says?
- It's saying nothing.
- I can hear it louder than the music.
Oh, Cathy.
I'm not the Cathy that was.
Can't you understand?
I'm somebody else. I'm another man's wife, and he loves me. And I love him.
If he loved you with all his soul for a lifetime... he couldn't love you as much as I do in a single day.
Not he. Not the world.
Not even you, Cathy, can come between us.
You must go away. You must leave this house and never come back.
I never want to see your face again as long as I live.
You lie.
Why do you think I'm here tonight?
Because you willed it.
You willed me here across the sea.
Cathy, have you seen Heathcliff?
Oh, there you are.
They're going to play a schottische.
Come along.
It's quite suitable to your high moral character.
What's the matter? Has Cathy been behaving horribly again?
If she weren't my sister-in-law,
I'd say she was jealous.
Come along.
Come in.
- I want to talk to you.
- What about, Cathy?
- About Heathcliff.
- It's very late.
I have no desire to discuss Heathcliff with you anyway.
- You behaved disgracefully tonight.
- In what way?
It was bad enough your asking him here, but to make a spectacle of yourself.
Catherine, be careful of what you say.
You fool. You vain little fool.
I'll not be silent any longer.
I'm going to tell the truth.
- Let me go.
- Not till I open your eyes.
My eyes are quite open, thank you.
Don't you see what he's doing?
He's using you to be near me... to smile at me behind your back... to try to rouse something in my heart that's dead.
I'll not have it.
I'll not allow you to help him.
It's you who are vain and insufferable.
- Heathcliff loves me.
- It's a lie.
It's not a lie. He's told me so.
He's kissed me.
He's held me in his arms.
He's told me that he loves me.
- I'm going to your brother.
- Go! He's asked me to marry him.
We're going to be married.
Heathcliff's going to be my husband.
You can't.
Heathcliff's not a man... but something dark and horrible to live with.
Do you imagine that I don't know why you're acting so?
Because you love him.
Yes! You love him! And you're mad with pain at the thought of my marrying him.
You want him to pine and dream of you... die for you, while you live in comfort as Mrs. Linton.
You don't want him to be happy.
You want to make him suffer.
You want to destroy him!
But I want to make him happy, and I will!
I heard your voices.
We were just discussing the ball.
There's plenty of time for gossip tomorrow.
You ought to come to bed, darling.
You look tired.
Good night.
- Good morning, Joseph.
- Mistress Cathy, I mean.
Mr. Hindley's away.
It's Mr. Heathcliff I wish to see.
Oh.
Oh, aye.
I'll try and find him.
Leave us, Joseph.
What brings you to Wuthering Heights?
Does Edgar know?
I doubt he'd approve.
Heathcliff, is it true?
- Is what true?
- That you asked Isabella to marry you.
It is true then.
Oh, Heathcliff, you must not do this.
She hasn't harmed you.
- You have.
- Then punish me!
I'm going to, when I take her in my arms-- when I promise her life and happiness.
If there's anything human left in you, don't do this.
Don't make me a partner to such a crime.
It's stupid. It's mad.
If you ever looked at me with what is in you, I'd be your slave.
If your heart were stronger than your fear of God and the world...
I would live silently contented in your shadow.
But no.
You must destroy us both with that weakness you call virtue.
You must keep me tormented with that cruelty you think so pious.
You've been smug and pleased with my vile love of you, haven't you?
After this, you won't think of me as
Cathy's foolish and despairing lover.
You'll think of me as Isabella's husband... and be glad for my happiness... as I was for yours.
- Drive to the village. Get Mr. Linton.
- Very well, ma'am.
Marry? It's preposterous.
Isabella and Heathcliff?
It's true.
What will you do about it?
Do? I'll put her under lock and key if need be.
- We must go after them.
- Going after them is useless.
We must go after them while there's still time. They mustn't marry.
Don't disturb yourself.
There's nothing I can do.
But you must, Edgar.
Get your pistols.
Go after them. Kill him!
But stop them from marrying.
This marriage cannot be, do you hear?
It must--
And so Heathcliff and Isabella were married.
Many months later at Wuthering Heights... during one of Dr. Kenneth's increasingly rare visits--
Why don't you hit yourself over the head with a hammer... the instant you get up in the morning?
- Why?
- If you hit yourself hard enough... you'll remain unconscious the whole day and achieve the same results... you would from a whole gallon of spirits... with much less wear and tear on the kidneys.
Don't you agree with me,
Mrs. Heathcliff?
What does it matter?
Well, I'd hoped that it did matter... that when you came here, things would change.
Only I changed.
I remember this house when it rang with laughter and love. Good-bye.
Ask your husband to call another doctor in future.
Whoever dwells in this house is beyond my healing arts.
I shall miss you, Dr. Kenneth.
I brought you into the world... but it's a world you're not going to grace very long if you stay here.
Dear child, I must tell you this.
Go back where you belong, back with Edgar for a month or two.
It would mean your salvation, and his.
Edgar's disowned me.
Nonsense. That was natural under the circumstances, but he needs you now.
He does. Why?
Cathy is gravely ill.
In fact, it's only a matter of days.
Hours, perhaps.
What is it?
Fever.
Inflammation of the lungs.
But there's something beyond that.
I don't know. I'd call it a will to die.
If Cathy died...
I might begin to live.
Begin to live, eh?
In this house with Heathcliff, nothing can live.
Nothing but hate. It's breathing like the devil's own breath on me.
And you, he hates you worse than he does me. He loathes you.
Each time you kiss him his heart breaks with rage because it's not Cathy.
- Kill him.
- I forbade you to speak about him.
- Stop it, you hear me?
- Kill him!
That's the first lucid talk I've heard out of Hindley for weeks.
It's not very Christian talk, but it's coherent.
Seemed to make some points.
- I'm delighted with your improvement.
- I tried to stop him.
Thank you, my dear wife.
Your loyalty is touching.
Your curses will come home to feed on your own heart.
Every agony you've given will return.
Why do we have him here?
I can't breathe with him in the house.
Existence would be so much less without my boyhood friend under my roof.
Don't you see?
You poison yourself with hating him.
Darling, please send him away and let love come into the house.
Why isn't there the smell of heather in your hair?
Why won't you let me come near you?
You're not black and horrible as they all think. You're full of pain.
I can make you happy. Let me try.
You won't regret it. I'll be your slave.
I can bring life back to you, new and fresh.
Why are your eyes always empty... like Linton's eyes?
They're not empty.
If you'd only look deeper.
Look at me.
I'm pretty.
I'm a woman, and I love you.
You're all of life to me.
Let me be a single breath of it for you.
Heathcliff, let your heart look at me just once.
Oh, why did God give me life?
What is it but hunger and pain?
What do you want, Ellen?
What are you doing here?
I want to speak to Miss Isabella.
You can do so in front of me.
Her brother has asked me to bring her home for a visit.
He needs you with him,
Miss Isabella.
Why?
Let go of me, Heathcliff.
Cathy. She's ill.
Yes.
Mr. Edgar wants you to come home at once, Miss Isabella.
She's dying.
You're not going.
She belongs to Edgar if she's dying.
Let her die where she belongs, in Edgar's arms.
Let her die.
Is that better?
Yes.
Isn't there a south wind?
Isn't the snow almost gone?
Quite gone down here, darling.
Just a few patches left.
The sky is blue, and the larks are singing... and the brooks are brimming full.
Will you get me something?
- What do you want, darling?
- Some heather.
There's a beautiful patch near the castle.
I want some from there.
Near the castle?
What castle, darling?
The castle on the moors, Edgar.
Go there, please.
There's no castle on the moors, darling.
There is.
It's on the hill... beyond Wuthering Heights.
- You mean Penistone Crag.
- Yes.
I was a queen there once.
Go there, Edgar.
Get me some heather, please.
I'll go. You sleep while I'm gone, and rest so you'll be better tomorrow.
You've been very dear to me, Edgar.
- Very dear.
- Sleep, darling.
Robert!
Get my horse ready.
I'm going to Dr. Kenneth. Be quick.
Yes, sir.
Come here.
I was dreaming... you might come before I died.
You might come and scowl at me once more.
Oh, Heathcliff... how strong you look.
How many years do you mean to live after I'm gone?
Don't--
Don't let me go.
If I could only hold you till we were both dead.
Will you forget me when I'm in the earth?
I could as soon forget you as my own life.
Cathy, if you die--
Poor Heathcliff. Come.
Let me feel how strong you are.
Strong enough to bring us both back to life, Cathy, if you want to live.
No, Heathcliff. I want to die.
Oh, Cathy.
Why did you kill yourself?
Hold me.
Just hold me.
No, I'll not comfort you.
My tears don't love you, Cathy.
They blight and curse and damn you.
Heathcliff, don't break my heart.
Oh, Cathy, I never broke your heart.
You broke it.
You loved me!
What right to throw love away for the poor fancy thing you felt for him?
For a handful of worldliness?
Misery, death and all the evils
God and man could've handed down... would never have parted us.
You did that alone.
You wandered off... like a wanton, greedy child... to break your heart and mine.
Heathcliff, forgive me.
We have so little time.
Oh, Cathy.
Cathy, your wasted hands.
Kiss me again.
Heathcliff, he's coming. Mr. Linton.
For heaven's sake, go! Only be quick!
It's the last time.
I won't go, Cathy. I'm here.
I'll never leave you again.
I told you, Ellen, when he went away, that night in the rain--
I told you I belonged to him, that he was my life, my being.
Don't listen to her ravings.
It's true.
I'm yours, Heathcliff.
I've never been anyone else's.
She doesn't know what she's saying.
You can still get out.
Go before they get here.
Take me to the window.
Let me look at the moors with you once more.
My darling. Once more.
How beautiful the day is.
Can you see the crag... over there where our castle is?
I'll wait for you... till you come.
Leave her alone.
She's mine.
She's mine now.
Miss Cathy.
Oh, my wild heart.
Miss Cathy.
She's gone.
You've done your last black deed,
Heathcliff. Leave this house.
She's at peace, in heaven and beyond us.
What do they know of heaven or hell, Cathy... who know nothing of life?
Oh, they're praying for you,
Cathy.
I'll pray one prayer with them.
I repeat till my tongue stiffens:
Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest so long as I live on.
I killed you.
Haunt me, then.
Haunt your murderer.
I know that ghosts have wandered
Be with me always.
Take any form. Drive me mad.
Only do not leave me in this dark alone, where I cannot find you.
I cannot live without my life.
I cannot die without my soul.
Oh, Cathy.
Oh, my dear.
I can still see and hear that wild hour...
I can still see and hear that wild hour... with poor Heathcliff trying to tear away the veil between death and life... crying out to Cathy's soul... to haunt him and torment him... till he died.
You say that was Cathy's ghost I heard at the window?
Not her ghost... but Cathy's love, stronger than time itself... still sobbing for its unlived days... and uneaten bread.
- What's the matter, man?
- I've gone mad.
- Stark raving mad.
- Dr. Kenneth.
I saw Heathcliff out in the moors in the snow with a woman.
- A woman, you say?
- Yes, a woman.
I saw her with him plain as my own eyes.
It was Cathy.
Go on, man. What happened?
No, I don't know who it was.
I was trying to get up near to them... when suddenly my horse reared and plunged, and I was thrown.
I called out to them, but they didn't hear me, so I followed them.
I tell you I saw them both!
He had his arm about her.
So I climbed up after them... and I found him.
Only him-- alone-- with only his footprints in the snow.
Under a high rock on a ledge near Penistone Crag.
Yes.
Was he dead?
No, not dead, Dr. Kenneth.
Not alone.
He's with her.
They've only just begun to live.
Good-bye, Heathcliff.
Good-bye, my wild, sweet Cathy.

To home Kinda tired, ain't you, Ma?
No, Mark.
Not very.
You can't fool this old horse trader.
I've been over these trails too many times not to know your first trip is a tough one.
But Mark, don't you think we better be stoppin' for supper?
Those youngsters back there are most likely starved.
Well, it won't take us so long to get out of the desert, Ma.
Before the yonder range we'll camp for the night.
John, this sure is lots of fun.
I wonder why Dad never took us on any of his other trips.
'Cause it ain't safe. It ain't safe for older folks, much less kids.
And anyhow, schoolin' was more important.
Aw, I don't like school none.
Anyway, I ain't seen an injun yet.
I'd like to see one. I'd shoot him right 'tween the eyes.
Put that gun down
'fore you get hurt.
I'd like to see some badmen. I'd show 'em how bad a fella could be.
I hope you like it out west, Ma.
It'll take us a little while to get settled, but, uh, we'll be gettin' in on the ground floor.
We'll make a go of it, Mark.
I'll be a heap happy to see you settling down to ranchin'... and give up this freight haulin' all over the west.
The boys are growing up, and they'll be needing you a lot more now, Mark.
I guess you're right, Ma.
I've been awful lucky. I'm gonna be glad to get out of it with a whole skin.
Ho.
Ballard, the Wyatt outfit's headed this way, across the Buckhorn trail.
- How much stock, Red?
- Oh, I'd say around 200 head.
Good beef stuff too.
Zeddie says he could use a few hundred head at a fair price.
How big an outfit with Wyatt?
Just a few hands. Oughta be easy.
Good. Get mounted. We'll hit them before they get across the desert.
Red, you and Chuck ride straight for the wagons a-shootin'.
Bronc, you and Sloppy ride out in front to head a getaway.
The rest o' ya, ride for the cattle.
We'll burn the wagons. Heel!
They're- They're trail jumpers.
Ma, take the line.
Hyah! Hyah-yah-yah-yah!
Unharness them horses.
We got every hand, Ballard. And the cattle's on their way to the camp.
Put up your hands or I'll dr-
Wait a minute, Red.
He's a spunky little critter.
Let's take him along.
- Fire them wagons.
Yah! Yah! Yah!
Let's get outa here.
Mother.
And as you gentlemen know, the discovery of gold in this state has encouraged... every outlaw and criminal west of the
Mississippi to move in here among you.
They're growing fast- stealing, destroying, murdering, and living by their guns at the expense of the decent and respectable citizens.
They outnumber law enforcement 20 to 1.
The honest people are so terrorized by them that they're leaving the country.
Unless something is done soon, the towns will be filled with nobodybutoutlaws.
Why are you so interested, my boy?
Since childhood, I've lived on the trail of bandits- hunting the men who murdered my parents, stole my brother.
If it takes the rest of my life,
I'll continue to hunt them down.
And at the same time, with the proper aid,
I can do a good service to this country.
Just what do you expect the state to do?
Only this:
I'm asking you to provide guns, ammunition, horses... and the men that I'll select.
And I promise you, I'll rid this state of every bandit that's in it... and make your trails safe to travel.
Young man, I speak for myself, but I voice the opinion of all.
Your plan is splendid, and we admire your courage, but it takes money to provide you the men and the necessary equipment you ask for.
The state treasury is without funds for such a purpose.
Our tax collections at this time are not enough to take care of our present obligations, much less added ones.
Therefore, we are powerless to accept your offer.
- I see.
- I only wish...
I could help you personally.
Thank you.
With money or no money...
I'll organize a band of men and drive every bandit gang out of this country.
Good night, gentlemen.
Howdy.
You Carter?
That's right.
And the answer, men, is... we must band together.
You, Carter, and you, Russell... and every man here has suffered from the injustice of these gangs.
And it's up to us to clean them out.
Now, my plan is this:
Every man here will ride a white horse, wear a black shirt and a white scarf, and this way we'll know each other in battle.
And I'm asking for single men only, and men who will stick.
Now, who will join me here? You can depend on me.
Me too. I'm with ya. You can count on me.
Good.
We'll call ourselves Vigilantes.
Looks like we're with you to the man, Cap'. I'm glad we are.
It's about time.

Captain looked kinda disappointed today... when he didn't locate the fellow he's after... after comin' all the way over here.
Yeah, but that won't stop him.
He'll rid the country of every outlaw gang till he finds his man.
You haven't been with us long.
Wait till you see how he works.
Who is it he's always lookin' for?
Don't know for sure.
Cap' ain't never said.
All kinds of stories, but that's a private affair with him.
When we were recruited, he said he wanted to make the west... a decent and safe place to live.
Oh, Carter.
Have the boys mount up.
We'll go into Red Bluff and spend the evening.
Maybe some of the boys would like a little sarsaparilla. Maybe they would. Me too.
I'll tell 'em.
Band of Vigilantes
Sons of pioneers
And we like to work up chasing bandits down
We are sons of tribulations to the outlaws of this nation
When we're ridin' down that rocky road to town
Seeing we're out like buckaroos
Let the outlaws hear the news
That the Vigilante men will ride them down
We are wicked to the bearer of a midnight dream of terror
When we're ridin' down that rocky road to town
Seeing we're out like buckaroos
Let the outlaws hear the news

We are wicked to the bearer of a midnight dream of terror
When we're ridin' down that rocky road to town
Get him to a doctor, men.
I'm goin' after them Singin' Riders.
They're camped just outside of town.
We'll get this gang.
Them fellas seem to be in a mighty big hurry.
Let's investigate.
Black Bart's gang has just robbed the express. That's them yonder.
We'll round the rocks, boys, and head 'em off.
Did you ever ride the
Buckhorn Trail? No. Never.
Did you ever hear of a gang that did ride it about 12 years ago?
No, never did.
Take these men in and turn 'em over to the townspeople, Carter, and see that that stolen money is returned to the express company.
What news? The Gordon herd is movin' up the Dalton Trail.
Crossed the Snake River yesterday.
Should be in Paiute Meadows in a few days. Well, good.
And I'll try and join up with 'em. I can use a herd like that for outlaw bait.
Now, you'll take the men and wait for me at the north end of Paiute Meadows.
We'll be pullin' out in the morning. Good enough.
We just trapped
Black Bart's gang.
All right, men.
Herd 'em into town.
Howdy.
You Lafe Gordon?
Yes, sir.
Who be you? Well, I might be some help to you.
I know this trail backwards. Heard you were trailin' shorthanded.
Thought I might tie up with you. Where y'all been workin'?
Well, the other side of the Snake, mostly. Rand and Richard's outfit.
Trail boss over there. Well,
I can use a good trail boss.
You know this country well, huh?
Yes, sir.
What's your name?
Uh, John Allen.
You're hired, Allen.
Thirty per and a bonus if there ain't no losses. Well, thanks, Lafe.
How's the herd holdin' up so far? Pretty good, considerin' the weather.
Well, I reckon I'll drop back and tell the boys we got a new hand.
Be seein' ya.
Hey, stupid!
Where do you think you're goin'?
Get back there with the herd, you muttonhead!
Just who do you think you're talking to? And who are you calling "muttonhead"?
Well, I, uh-
That is, uh-
- And just what are you doing here, if I may ask?
- Well, I'm the new trail boss.
Well, my name's Mary Gordon, and my father owns this outfit.
So from now on it's "Miss Gordon" to you, not "muttonhead," you- you dumbbell!
Where'd you get the new maverick, Dad?
Just dropped out of a clear sky.
He looks like a good hand to have around.
Good morning,
Miss Gordon.
Oh, good morning,
Mister... Muttonhead.
Can I saddle up for you?
Oh, I've been doing it for years.
I guess once more won't hurt me.
Well, that's right.
I agree with you. A girl that rides a trail herd... should be made to do her own work.
There we are.
All ready to go.
Any more orders? A good trail boss always rides at the head of his outfit.
Yes, Miss Gordon.
Well,
Plug Lewis just rode in. Said the
Gordon herd's movin' up the Dalton Trail.
That's what I've been waitin' to hear. Where's the kid? Outside.
Blackie, get Jim in here.
- Hey, Jim!
- Well, what is it?
Ballard wants to see ya.
What's up?
Don't know.
All right.
Well, what is it? The Gordon herd is out on the flat.
I've got 'em as good as sold. Bring 'em in. Do ya understand? Sure. Don't worry.
Say, I hear that Singin' Rider outfit is making it plenty hot for the boys down Sonora way.
Keep your eyes open.
I ain't worried none.
Don't be too sure o' yourself.
I hear they're tough- mighty tough.
Ah, forget 'em. I'll take the boys and figure things out.
Come on, men.
It's funny what a great outlaw that Wyatt kid turned out to be.
Shut up, you fool. Don't ever mention his real name again. I don't want him to remember it.
He doesn't know yet it was us that killed his folks.
Early start, Lafe. If it keeps cool, we oughta cover a lot o' ground.
Yeah, we did right well yesterday.
That's because of our new trail boss.
Allen!
Look yonder.
Come on.
Let's go.
Easy, pardner.
There.
What happened?
Held up. They stole my horse and left me to die.
Where'd they get ya?
About five miles backtrail.
I got this far, but couldn't get much further without a horse.
John, have the boys bring the chuck wagon. We'll fix him up.
Guess we'll go through Paiute Meadows sometime tomorrow, won't we, Allen?
About noon, I judge, if it's of any interest to you. Oh, no. Just wonderin'.
I thought you would be.
This Allen fella been with ya long? No. Why?
Oh, nothin'.
Thought I'd seen him someplace before.
No, he just joined up with us on this trip. He's all right. I know.
Don't be too sure, Miss Gordon.
Of course,
I ain't accusin' Allen.
But that's an old trick in trail jumpin'.
You put a man with an outfit so's he steers you right into the trap.
But John isn't that kind.
You can't tell, Mary. We don't know much about him.
Your father's right.
You don't know him.
We know him as well as we know you.
Yeah?
But I didn't come looking for a job, did I?
Say, maybe you're right.
I'm gonna keep my eye on him anyway.
Good.
You're the girl that I loved
Long ago
The girl that I held
In my dreams
When e'er castles high
I built in the sky
You were my queen
Of queens
You've the eyes?
The lips and the hair
Of my girl in my castles
Of air
Since they've faded away
I've been longing each day
For the girl that I loved
In my dreams
Oh, please sing it again.
All right, boss.
Anything you say, goes.
What's up, Jim?
Boys, we gotta change our plans.
I run into a stranger with the outfit, and I don't like his looks.
But I'll have that herd at Paiute Meadows by sunup.
Be ready to crack down on 'em.
Well, I've gotta get back so they don't get suspicious.
Well, if you'll excuse me, Mary,
I think I'll hit the hay.
I'm kinda tired.
Thanks so much.
I enjoyed your music.
Well, good night, muttonhead.
Good night, stupid.
Dad, I think you're wrong about John.
Don't worry, Mary.
We'll know better tomorrow.
Where's John Allen? Why, he's turned in for the night.
I thought so.
It's a trick.
Ain't he in camp?
I can't find him. And his horse ain't here neither.
Just as I figured. Gone to get his gang. I don't believe it.
Let's drive on tonight.
We can beat him to it.
Why, we can be in Paiute Meadows by sunup.
It's a good idea.
Tell the boys to roll the herd.
We're shoving out tonight. Right.
I think you're making a mistake, Dad.
Just the same, I'm not taking any chances.
All right, men, go get 'em!
I got the guy that plugged you, Lafe.
Good work, son.
Take care of 'em, boys!
Are you all right?
Yes, thanks to you.
You get 'em all?
Didn't miss a one.
Held this fellow for you and sweated him.
Admits he rode the Buckhorn Trail.
You used to ride the Buckhorn Trail, eh?
What of it? Do you know who trail-jumped the Wyatt family?
What's it worth to ya?
Plenty, if you know.
Just how much?
Your life.
I ain't tellin'.
Whit Ballard did it. Whit
Ballard? Well, where's he?
I don't know. Don't lie! Where is he?
You'll find him over in around Grass Valley.
All right, Carter.
You can let this man go.
Our bargain is that you clear out of the country and stay away from Grass Valley.
Now, get goin'.
Carter, you take the herd on into Grass Valley... and wait for us at the south end of town.
All right, Cap.
Why didn't you tell us who you were when you joined us?
I didn't see any reason to tell.
I thought there might be trouble and I'd lend you a hand.
Oh, I see.
Then you expected trouble.
Well, chasin' outlaws, a fella can always expect trouble.
Are you in the government service?
No. I- I organized these men for a personal reason.
Oh, I'm sorry, John. I didn't mean to be inquisitive.
Oh, that's all right. It's nothing you shouldn't know.
As a matter of fact, I'd like to have you know all about me.
For 12 years I've lived with but one thought in my mind: to get the men who killed my parents and stole my younger brother.
If he's still alive,
I'm gonna find him.
Come on, boy!
Dad, you're wounded!
Just a little nip in the shoulder.
But if it hadn't been for Jim here, they'd have got me sure. Oh, I did the best I could.
Those Singin' Riders really took care of things.
I'm sorry, Jim. I guess
I had you figured wrong.
That's all right. We all make mistakes.
And I sure was wrong about you.
It's lucky John's men got here in time to save us.
-Did you find out who jumped us?
-They've all been taken care of.
I told Carter to take the herd on into Grass Valley for you, and I think we'd better get you to a doctor.
Well, folks, if you don't mind,
I'll be pullin' stakes.
It's only 20 miles to Grass Valley, and
I'd like to get there as soon as possible.
That's all right, son. I want to thank you for the help you give us.
Just keep the horse you been usin'.
When you get to Grass Valley, leave him in the livery stable and we'll pick him up.
Well, folks, I'll be seein' you all later.
I told you to watch out for that Singing Riders crowd.
But you wouldn't listen to me.
You were too sure of yourself.
No, I wasn't.
We were outnumbered five to one.
You couldn't have done any better yourself.
They got all our boys except you and Red.
How'd he get away?
Outfigured 'em, he said.
Well, I'm tellin' you one thing.
You ain't gonna be able to do anything with those Singin' Riders outfit hangin' around.
They sure ruined that job.
Ah, forget it.
You can't cash on somethin' you ain't got.
Now, listen to this. There's over
$60,000 in gold in the Commercial Bank.
Brought in last night from that Big Creek strike.
I was waitin' for you and the boys to come back before I pulled the job, but I had to go get Dugan and his gang to help us out.
Well, you'd better strike quick and clear out. Those Singin' Riders are headed this way.
While the doctor's taking care of your father, I'll mosey on down the street.
There's someone I want to see. We'll wait here for you.
Is, uh, Ballard around?
No, he's not. He drops in every once in a while.
Thanks.
Ed.
Come in.
What's up, Hank?
There's a fellow downstairs lookin' for you.
Yeah? Who is he?
Hisrealname is Wyatt.
Wyatt?
You remember, Ballard.
- What do you mean?
- Oh, nothin' much.
Only when I was travelin' with the Cummings gang, it was Wyatt and his
Singin' Riders that broke us up.
He was lookin' for you then.
Seems that he's out to get you.
He's here now.
Jim, Hank says that Singin'
Rider fella's downstairs.
Where?
At the bar.
That's him all right.
Lucky thing I didn't go downstairs. He thinks I'm a friend.
Wait a minute, partner.
You've forgotten something, haven't you? What do you mean?
Our bargain was that you stay clear of Grass Valley.
Besides bein' a thief, you're a liar.
Listen, Hank. You go down and get the boys and handle him any way you can.
But handle him!
Don't shoot, Jim. There's too many townsmen there.
Besides, you might get one of our own men.
Why, he's just like a wildcat.
Look at him go!
He's in here, Ballard!
Break that door down!
He's got out the window! You better stop him before he gets to his men!
Come on!
He went that way!
Wait a minute, men.
Have you seen John?
Yes. Uh-
Why, he's upstairs. He's just been hurt in a fight.
Hurt?
I'll take you to him.
What's the idea?
Who's the girl?
Wait a minute. That's Gordon's daughter. I got a swell idea.
What's the girl got to do with it?
We'll never stop Allen from getting to his men now. But with her here, we can.
I'll show you.
Come on, boys!
This note will hold off Allen's riders and bring him right into our hands.
Send some of the boys to Blind Canyon.
When they finish with him, tell 'em to come back and meet us at Wild Horse Corral.
Get the rest of the boys ready to clean out the bank as soon as I get back.
Get the rest of the Dugan gang ready and the wagon quick.
Let's go.
Hurry up, man.
Get that wagon.
All right, boys.
Get mounted.
You're pretty smart, Ballard. You let him play right into your hand.
I get it.
Brother against brother.
Forget about that brother stuff.
You don't know about it, see?
Go out and get the boys.
We're movin' right away.
What about Jim? Well,
Jim's served his purpose.
When he's found out about his brother, it'll be just too bad.
The Singin' Riders will take care of him anyway.
Besides, it's one less cut on the gold.
Now, get goin'.
You men get ready to cover the town.
Rode out to get you, Allen. Just learned that Ballard's gang are holding Mary.
They sent this note.
"Allen, I'm holding Gordon's girl, and we've got a deal to make you.
"Leave your riders and come to Blind
Canyon alone if you want us to release her.
Ballard."
Carter, I'm goin' in there alone.
You keep the men here.
If I'm not back in a half an hour, come and get me.
It was the Ballard outfit.
They got all the gold.
We oughta hang every one of 'em. Have you sent out to the mine for help?
I'll go right now.
I'll go with you.
Let's get the gang together and we'll all go.
Where's Ballard? I don't know. They've gone.
And they've tricked you into double-crossing your own brother.
What do you mean?
John Allen is your brother.
John Allen's my brother?
Yes.
His real name is John Wyatt, and you're Jim Wyatt.
I overheard Ballard tell Red while I was in the closet.
John's been looking for you ever since they wiped out your family.
You've got to save him.
Look out, John!
They've trapped John in Blind Canyon.
Come on.
Thanks, Jim.
Where's Mary?
She's safe. She's gone to get your riders. What do you mean?
I framed you, John. I sent you in to this, and I'll get you out,
'cause... you're my brother. Brother?
Yes. Mary told me everything. She overheard Red and Ballard's conversation.
Ballard wanted you killed so that I'd never know.
Jim.
We've gotta get
Ballard, Jim.
Their horses are in back of us. I'll hold them off while you make a run for it.
It's your only chance.
What's your chance?
Oh, never mind me.
We'll both run for it.
That's Ballard in the wagon.
Hyah, hyah, hyah, hyah!
Jim!
Did you get Ballard, John?
Everything's squared.
Guess I ain't gonna make it, John.
You won't hold it against me, will ya?
No, Jim.
Funny. I always wanted to be a bad man, even when we were kids.
Do you remember?
I, I guess I'm gettin' what I deserve.
Over the prairies
To home?
Covered wagon
Rolling westward ho? I'm leaving tomorrow, disbanding the men.
Where are you going?
Back to my ranch in California.
It's gonna be lonesome out there.
Do you think you could ever care for a, a-
A muttonhead like you?
You guessed it, stupid.

YOUR HIGHNESS,
I REGRET
TO INFORM YOU
YOUR BROTHER
WILL NOT BE PRESENT.
WHY NOT?
THERE'S BEEN
AN ACCIDENT.
HE IS DEAD?
YES, YOUR HIGHNESS.
ASSASSINATED?
YES, YOUR HIGHNESS.
GOD REST HIS SOUL.
WHAT HAS BEEN DONE?
A NUMBER OF SUSPECTS
HAVE BEEN ARRESTED.
SHOOT THEM--
ALL OF THEM.
WITHOUT TRIAL?
THEY DID NOT GIVE
MY BROTHER A TRIAL.
WE'LL SHOW THEM
WHAT A REAL KILLING
CAN BE LIKE.
YOUR HIGHNESS,
ANOTHER WHOLESALE
EXECUTION--
YOU'VE HAD
YOUR ORDERS.
BUT, SIR, I CAN'T
OBEY SUCH ORDERS.
Man: SHH. NATASHA.
UNCLE IGOR...
PAUL...
IS IT TRUE
ABOUT MY FATHER?
NATASHA.
YES.
YOUR FIANCE
SEEMS TO SYMPATHIZE
WITH THE ASSASSINS.
DARLING, BECAUSE
THEY MURDERED,
WE CAN'T
MURDER BACK.
IT'S THE FIRST THING
YOUR FATHER WOULD
HAVE SAID.
TAKE ME TO HIM.
NATASHA, YOUR PLACE
IS HERE.
THE EMPRESS'
LADY-IN-WAITING

FOR ANY REASON,
PRINCE CHEGODIEFF.
BUT, YOUR
HIGHNESS--
PAUL.
[GAVEL RAPS]
Man: HIS IMPERIAL HIGHNESS
THE ARCHDUKE FERDINAND
OF AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.
[ORCHESTRA PLAYING]
FERDINAND, WHAT
AN ANGEL YOU ARE
TO COME SO FAR.
I WOULDN'T HAVE MISSED IT
FOR ANYTHING. YOUR MAJESTY.
FERDINAND.
AND ALIX.
YOUR IMPERIAL
HIGHNESSES.
IF THE EMPEROR
HAD BEEN WELL,
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN
HERE HIMSELF.
OH, HE WOULD NOT BOTHER
ABOUT US PARVENUS.
WHAT IS 300 YEARS
TO A HAPSBURG?
WE ARE FEELING
OUR YEARS, THOUGH, HMM?
IN CELEBRATION
OF YOUR ANNIVERSARY,
THE EMPEROR HAS
ASKED ME TO CONFER
THE ORDER
OF THE IRON CROWN
ON HIS LITTLE HIGHNESS.
OH, HOW BEAUTIFUL.
NO, NO,
AT THE TOP.
WELL, ALOYSHA,
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
WILL YOUR HIGHNESS
HONOR ME
BY EXPRESSING
TO HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY
OUR SINCERE GRATITUDE
FOR THIS GREAT HONOR?
Ferdinand: THAT'S
A BEAUTIFUL SPEECH.
WHAT A SOLDIER.
IF WE EVER HAVE
A WAR,
WILL YOU PROMISE ME
TO FIGHT FOR AUSTRIA?
YES, YOUR HIGHNESS.
GOOD.
HE WILL STAY HOME.
OH, WELL.
HA HA HA!
YOUR IMPERIAL
MAJESTIES,
I WISH TO EXTEND
THE SYMPATHY OF FRANCE
IN YOUR TERRIBLE LOSS.
THE GRAND DUKE, SIR,
HE WAS FOND OF MY COUNTRY.
PAUL.
Paul:
YOUR MAJESTY.
SERGEI--SERGEI?
YES,
YOUR MAJESTY.
I WAS LAUGHING
AND TALKING WITH HIM
ONLY THIS MORNING.
YOUR MAJESTIES,
I'M SO SORRY
I BROUGHT THE NEWS.
EXCELLENCY, WE SHOULD
HAVE HEARD SOON.
CANCEL
THE AUDIENCE.
ALOYSHA, GO WITH
YOUR SISTERS.
OH, TAKE THIS AWAY.
MY HEAD ACHES.
Woman:
YES, MAJESTY.
DO YOU WANT
THE DOCTOR, MY DEAR?
OH, NO, NICKY.
IT'S NOTHING.
I'M ALL RIGHT.
I CAN'T HELP
THINKING OF SERGEI.
HE WAS
SO FULL OF LIFE,
SO STRONG.
DO YOU REMEMBER
THAT ROSE GARDEN
AT BIALYSTOK
AND THE MARBLE
STAIRS
HE NEVER
LET ME CLIMB?
ONCE HE TRIED
TO CARRY US BOTH.
WHY DIDN'T WE
STAY THERE, NICKY?
WE WERE HAPPY--
HUMAN BEINGS.
NOBODY WANTED
TO KILL US THERE.
THERE WERE
NO SOLDIERS THEN.
THIS IS OUR DESTINY,
MY DEAR.
I KNOW.
WHAT HAVE WE DONE
TO THESE PEOPLE
OF YOURS, NICKY,
THEY SHOULD
HATE US SO?
NOTHING, ALIX.
EVERYBODY LOVES YOU.
YOU KNOW THAT.
NO...
BUT YOU LOVE ME,
NICKY.
THAT'S ENOUGH
FOR ANY EMPRESS.
[CHOIR SINGING

LIEUTENANT KARPOV,
WHO DETAILED
THE CHEVALIER GUARDS
TO THE FIRING SQUAD?
HIS IMPERIAL HIGHNESS
THE GRAND DUKE IGOR,
PRINCE.
OH, HE DID?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY INTERFERING
WITH MY ORDERS?
YOUR HIGHNESS,
THIS IS NOT
YOUR REGIMENT.
I WILL TAKE
ALL RESPONSIBILITY.
FORTUNATELY, I'VE
ALREADY DONE SO.
WE CHEVALIER GUARDS
HAVE ON OUR HELMETS
FOR FAITH
AND COURAGE,
NOT MURDER.
I COMMANDED
THIS COURT-MARTIAL!
NOBODY COMMANDS
MY REGIMENT
BUT THE EMPRESS
HERSELF.
AAH! YOU WANT TO SHOOT US
YOURSELF, YOU JUDAS!
AND I KNOW
THEIR MAJESTIES
WOULD WISH
THESE PEOPLE TO HAVE
A FAIR TRIAL.
YOU ARE
UNDER ARREST.
ANY SUCH ORDER,
YOUR HIGHNESS,
MUST COME
DIRECTLY FROM
THEIR MAJESTIES.

OH, BE QUIET.
NO ONE'S GOING TO HURT YOU.
[SPITS]
WAIT!
THAT'S
YOUR THANKS,
CHEGODIEFF.
WELL, IT, UH...
IT ISN'T BLOOD.
TAKE HER AWAY.
YOU READY,
YOUR HIGHNESS?
[CAR APPROACHING]
[TRUMPET PLAYING

[KNOCK ON DOOR]
YES.
IGOR, WE'RE SO SORRY.
YOU GOT OUR MESSAGE?
THANK YOU.
UNCLE IGOR,
TOMORROW WE'LL MEET
WITH THE MINISTER
OF JUSTICE
AND DECIDE
WHAT'S TO BE DONE.
OH, TOMORROW.
NICKY, HOW LONG
DO I HAVE TO STAND
INSOLENCE
AND INSUBORDINATION
FROM YOUR
COURT FAVORITES?
WELL, WHO IS IT
THIS TIME?
PRINCE CHEGODIEFF.
Alexandra:
SHOULD I LEAVE, NICKY?
NO, NO, MY DEAR.
AND WHAT'S HE DONE?
HE HAS
BEEN INSOLENT,
DISOBEYED ORDERS,
AND GROSSLY
INSUBORDINATE
IN THE PRESENCE
OF OTHERS!
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL PUNISH HIM.
THAT'S WHAT
YOU SAID LAST TIME.
I KNOW HE'S
YOUR LITTLE PET,
BUT IF I'M TO REMAIN
GOVERNOR GENERAL
OF MOSCOW,
I'LL NOT BE MADE
A FOOL OF
BY A COLONEL
IN HER MAJESTY'S
GUARDS.
AND WHERE IS HE NOW?
HE'S HERE.
CALL HIM IN.
COLONEL CHEGODIEFF.
YES, YOUR MAJESTY.
IF I HEAR
ONE MORE CRITICISM
OF YOUR BEHAVIOR,
I'M GOING TO RELIEVE YOU
OF YOUR COMMAND.
YOU MUST REALIZE
YOU'RE A SOLDIER
SUBJECT
TO YOUR SUPERIORS.
MAY I EXPLAIN,
YOUR MAJESTY?
NO. YOU CAN
APOLOGIZE.
AS COLONEL OF HER MAJESTY'S
CHEVALIER GUARDS,
I OFFER MY APOLOGIES
FOR INSUBORDINATION
WHILE YOUR IMPERIAL
HIGHNESS
ASSUMED THE DUTIES
OF PUBLIC EXECUTION.
I DEMAND HIS ARREST.
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT'S THIS
ABOUT EXECUTIONS?
FOR THE ASSASSINATION
OF MY BROTHER--YOUR UNCLE.
IT'S FOR ME
TO DECIDE WHAT ACTION
SHOULD BE TAKEN.
THIS CALLS
FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION.
UNDER MARTIAL LAW,
I ACTED WITHIN MY RIGHTS.
HOW MANY ARE DEAD?
I DON'T KNOW.
YOUR MAJESTY--
4 OF THEM WOMEN.
AFTER--AFTER
ALL OUR PROMISES
OF REFORM...
NICKY, THEY STARTED
THE KILLING.
PAUL LEFT ME ALONE.
YOUR GRANDFATHER
DID NOT HESITATE.
THERE WERE
NO ASSASSINATIONS
DURING HIS REIGN.
THIS IS ANOTHER
CENTURY, IGOR.
WHAT YOU HAVE DONE
HAS PUT US BACK 20 YEARS
IN THE EYES
OF EUROPE.
MY DEAR EMPRESS--
OR WOULD YOU RATHER
BE CALLED KAISERIN?
IGOR!
THE LAST EMPRESS GERMANY
GAVE US--CATHERINE--
WAS USUALLY CALLED
"THE GREAT."
I MEANT
NO DISRESPECT,
MAJESTY,
BUT YOU HAVE NEVER
UNDERSTOOD
THE RUSSIAN
TEMPERAMENT.
MODERATION
MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT
IN GERMANY,
BUT HERE
IT WOULD BE FATAL.
IT HAS NEVER BEEN
TRIED HERE.
WHAT IF, INSTEAD
OF MY BROTHER,
IT HAD BEEN
YOUR SON?
YOU REALLY ARE
A VERY CRUEL MAN, IGOR.
Nikolai:
IGOR, PLEASE.
WE MUST DO
SOMETHING AT ONCE--
SOMETHING THAT WILL
REACH THE PEOPLE
BEFORE THE NEWS
OF THESE EXECUTIONS.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
YES.
YOUR MAJESTY.
I'M GLAD
I FOUND YOU,
IGOR.
DO YOU REALIZE
WHAT'S GOING ON
OUT THERE?
YOU MEAN
THE CROWD?
THEY'RE MERELY CELEBRATING,
YOUR HIGHNESS.
WEREN'T THEY TOLD
THE CEREMONIES ARE OVER?
THEY'RE DEMANDING
THE CZAREVITCH!
IT SEEMS THEY WERE
TOLD HE'D APPEAR.
HE WINOT APPEAR.
BUT THEY'RE
GETTING UGLY!
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
WE'LL BE ABLE
TO GET RID OF THEM.
DO YOU THINK
I'LL WAVE MY SON
IN FRONT OF
THAT MOB
AFTER
WHAT HAPPENED
TO SERGEI?
ALIX!
ALIX. ALIX.
NICKY, NICKY, DEAR,
WE'RE ALWAYS
HOLDING HIM
BETWEEN US
AND THE CROWD.
WHY CAN'T YOU FIND
SOMEONE BIGGER
TO HIDE BEHIND?
HE'S NOT
A SACRED IMAGE.
HE'S MY SON--
THE HEIR
TO THE THRONE!
DEAREST ALIX, WE'RE NOT
SENDING HIM OUT.
OF COURSE NOT.
MAY I ASK
YOUR PERMISSION
TO DISPERSE THEM
AS I SEE FIT?
THEY'RE GETTING
UGLY.
I'LL DISPERSE THEM
IF YOUR MAJESTY ORDERS.
IT'S PERFECTLY SIMPLE
FOR A FEW THOUSAND SOLDIERS
TO RIDE DOWN A MOB,
BUT HOW LONG
CAN YOU GO ON, SIR?
YOU CAN'T SHOOT
160 MILLION PEOPLE,
AND GOD HELP
THE DYNASTY
IF THEY EVER LEARN
TO HATE YOU, YOUR MAJESTY.
YOU HAVEN'T
ENOUGH SOLDIERS
OR ENOUGH WALLS
TO KEEP THEM BACK.
PAUL!
YOUR MAJESTY,
PUNISH MY IMPERTINENCE
WITH DEATH IF YOU WILL,
BUT YOU'RE ON A VOLCANO
DAY AND NIGHT.
YOUR ONLY BULWARK,
YOUR ONLY SECURITY
IS THE LOVE YOUR PEOPLE
HAVE FOR YOU AND ALOYSHA,
BUT THAT LOVE COULD BE
KILLED BY VIOLENCE,
AND ANYONE
WHO PROPOSES IT
NOW--ANYONE--
IS A TRAITOR
TO YOU AND RUSSIA
AND THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE.
NICKY,
WHY DO YOU TOLERATE
SUCH IMPUDENCE?
THERE ARE
WOMEN AND CHILDREN
OUT THERE, YOUR MAJESTY.
WOMEN AND CHILDREN
HAVE NO BUSINESS
IN A MOB!
IGOR!
Alexandra: WAIT!
WAIT.
[CROWD SHOUTING]
IGOR, I AM A WOMAN.
I HAVE A CHILD.
ALIX.
NICKY, I CAN'T BEAR
TO THINK
THAT SOMEONE
WILL TELL ALOYSHA
WHEN HE'S GROWN UP
THAT HIS SAFETY
WAS EVER HELD
ABOVE THE LIVES
OF HIS PEOPLE.
TELL THE CZAREVITCH
THEY'RE WAITING.
NO! I'LL GO.
[CROWD ROARS]
[PEOPLE ALL TALKING
AT ONCE]
THANK YOU,
DARLING.
SOME FOR YOU,
MARIA?
MAMUSHKA, LOOK.
IT'S MARIA.
I THINK
IT'S CHARMING.
PAUL!
Alexandra: PAUL,
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
YOUR MAJESTIES.
PAUL, HOW LONG ARE YOU
GOING TO BE HERE?
Paul: YOU SHOULD ASK
YOUR FATHER. I'M HERE
AT HIS COMMAND.
I RECEIVED
YOUR SUMMONS, SIR.
YES, PAUL.
I'M WEARY.
THE TASK
OF GOVERNING
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
IS GETTING
BEYOND MY STRENGTH.
I WANT TO SHARE
THE BURDEN OF GOVERNMENT
WITH MY PEOPLE.
I WANT TO FORM
A DUMA, PAUL,
ALONG THE LINES
OF THE BRITISH
PARLIAMENT
OR THE GERMAN
REICHSTAG.
I WANT MEN ELECTED
TO THAT DUMA
BY POPULAR VOTE--
LEADERS WHO WOULD
HELP ME,
WHO'LL REPRESENT
MY PEOPLE.
SUCH A DUMA, SIR,
WOULD PUT US
ON AN EQUAL FOOTING
WITH ANY NATION
IN THE WORLD.
I WANT YOU
TO HELP ME FORM IT.
OH, YOUR MAJESTY.
THESE REFORMS TAKE
YEARS TO ACCOMPLISH
THE GOOD
THAT'S INTENDED.
LET'S HOPE
WE LIVE TO SEE IT.
ALOYSHA WILL,
AT ANY RATE.
Paul: YOUR MAJESTY.
WE CAN GO OVER
THE GROUNDWORK
IN MY STUDY.
OH, NICKY, THE DUMA
CAN WAIT ONE OTHER DAY.
YOU PROMISED ME
THIS AFTERNOON.
IS THE PHOTOGRAPHER
HERE?
YES, YOUR MAJESTY.
OH, ALIX.
NICKY, IF
I LET YOU OFF AGAIN,
A WHOLE YEAR
WILL SLIP BY.
SHOW HIM IN.
OH, ALIX, I'D
RATHER PLAY BRIDGE
WITH COUSIN WILHELM.
HA HA! REMEMBER,
WE ARE HIS FIRST ROYAL CLIENTS.
PAUL, DO ME A FAVOR.
DON'T WATCH THIS.
HA HA HA! NATASHA,
LET'S GO AND DISCUSS MY VICES.
I HAVE TO LOOK AFTER
THE EMPRESS' LETTERS.
YOUR MAJESTY,
MAY I, UH, HELP HER?
I THINK YOU'LL BE
A TREMENDOUS
HELP, PAUL.
I'LL DO MY BEST.
COME ALONG,
MY BROOD!
COME HERE, NATASHA.
BUT I HAVE TO SEE
ABOUT THOSE LETTERS.
MY DEAR CHILD, YOU KNOW,
THIS LETTER-WRITING'S
A MENACE. I MEAN,
YOU WRITE THEM.
SOME POOR WRETCH HAS TO
READ THEM. HE WRITES
YOU BACK AGAIN.
YOU HAVE TO ANSWER IT.
I MEAN, WHERE ARE YOU?
I MEAN,
THE WHOLE THING'S
INTERMINABLE.
IT DOESN'T MEAN
ANYTHING.
NATASHA,
WILL YOU MARRY ME?
I'M GOING TO!
I MEAN NOW.
PAUL--
LISTEN, DARLING.
IT DOESN'T HELP
THE DEAD ANY
TO STOP LIVING
JUST BECAUSE
THEY'RE GONE.
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL
ABOUT THESE THINGS.
I KNOW, SWEETHEART.
I SUPPOSE RELIGION'S
A WONDERFUL THING.
YES, I PRESUME IT IS,
BUT I MEAN,
IT CAN BE OVERDONE.
IT'S HELPED YOU THROUGH
A TERRIBLE TIME, I KNOW,
BUT IT'S
CHANGED YOU, TOO.
I CAN'T EXPLAIN, PAUL.
IT--IT'S PEACE,
HAPPINESS.
IF YOU COULD TALK TO HIM,
YOU'D UNDERSTAND.
TALK HIM?
FATHER RASPUTIN.
OH, IS HE A PRIEST?
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BE A PRIEST
TO HAVE THE POWER OF GOD.
OH, REALLY?
IF YOU TALKED TO HIM,
YOU COULDN'T HELP FEELING
THE GREATNESS OF HIS SOUL.
I THINK THE SAINTS
MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE HIM.
WELL, IF HE'S
HELPED YOU,
I'M VERY GRATEFUL
TO HIM, DARLING,
BUT--BUT IT SEEMS
I'VE LOST YOU.
THERE'S SOMETHING
I CAN'T SEE--
SOMETHING
I CAN'T FIGHT.
Natasha: PAUL.
YOU'LL NEVER
LOSE ME...
IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU STILL WANT.
OH, DARLING,
OF COURSE IT IS...
ONLY LET THE HALO
SLIP A LITTLE,
LIKE IT USED TO BE--
OVER ONE EYE.
I WILL BE
A GOOD WIFE, PAUL.
I DON'T WANT
A GOOD WIFE...
UNTIL I'M SO OLD
I HAVE TO BE GOOD MYSELF.
Aloysha: OH! HA HA!
LOOK AT PAUL AND NATASHA!
OH, MAMUSHKA!
I SAW YOU, PAUL!
I SAW YOU!
ALOYSHA, UNDER
CERTAIN CONDITIONS,
ONE OFFICER NEVER
SEES ANOTHER.
PULL HIS HAIR,
MARIA.
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
HEY, ALOYSHA,
COME ON!
ALOYSHA.
MAMUSHKA,
HE'S BLEEDING.
ALOYSHA.
PAUL, SEND
FOR REMEZOV AT ONCE.
Paul: YES,
YOUR MAJESTY.
ALOYSHA. ALOYSHA.
BUT, DOCTOR, IT'S
ONLY A SLIGHT FALL.
IT'S MORE SERIOUS
THAN THAT.
HELLO, OPERATOR,
I WANT TO TALK
TO DR. FRANZ WOLFE
IN VIENNA.
YES, PLEASE.
DID YOU EVER HEAR
OF HEMOPHILIA?
YES. THE EMPRESS'
UNCLE DIED OF IT.
AND HER GRANDFATHER.
IT'S THE HERITAGE
OF HER HOUSE.
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
WELL, THEY'RE ALL
SO HEALTHY.
THE GIRLS, YES.
IT CAN ONLY BE
TRANSMITTED
FROM MOTHER TO SON.
THERE'S AN ELEMENT
LACKING IN THE BLOOD.
IT DOESN'T--
IT DOESN'T COAGULATE.
THE SLIGHTEST INJURY
MAY CAUSE THEM
TO BLEED TO DEATH.
HERR DOKTOR?
HERR DOKTOR WOLFE?
[SPEAKING GERMAN]
[CHOIR SINGING
IN RUSSIAN]
MAJESTY.
THANK GOD. PAUL HAS
FOUND DR. WOLFE.
WHERE ARE THEY?
AT THE FRONTIER.
THEY'LL BE HERE
IN THE MORNING.
I MUST TELL NICHOLAS.
NICKY, DEAR.
HE'S THE GREATEST
PHYSICIAN IN EUROPE.
HE'S STILL BLEEDING.
SHH, HEART.
I KNOW, BUT...
BUT...
NICKY...
YOU MUST HAVE THE TRACK
CLEARED FOR THAT TRAIN.
OF COURSE.
[WEAKLY]
MAMA...
MAMUSHKA...
WILL YOU SAY
MY PRAYERS?
I CAN'T
REMEMBER THEM.
GENTLE JESUS,
MEEK AND MILD,
LOOK UPON
THE LITTLE CHILD.
IS THAT THE ONE?
YES.
PITY MY SIMPLICITY...
THERE'S SOME MORE.
SUFFER ME...
TO COME TO THEE...
AND ASK HIM
NOT TO MAKE IT
HURT ANYMORE.
[ALEXANDRA SOBBING]
DON'T, MAMUSHKA.
DON'T.
Alexandra:
NO, MAMUSHKA...
IS ONLY LAUGHING.
[TRYING TO LAUGH]
ONLY LAUGHING.
[SOBBING]
THAT'S RIGHT,
YOUR IMPERIAL HIGHNESS.
YOUR MOTHER IS HAPPY
BECAUSE YOU'RE
DOING SO WELL.
[QUIETLY]
YOUR MAJESTY,
FOR YOUR OWN SAKE--
FOR THE BOY'S SAKE.
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.
SHE MUST HAVE
SOME SLEEP.
Alexandra: REMEZOV.
Remezov: YES,
YOUR MAJESTY.
THE DOCTOR
FROM VIENNA
WILL BE HERE
IN THE MORNING.
SPLENDID,
YOUR MAJESTY.
DO YOU THINK
THIS MAN CAN
CURE MY SON?
IF ANYONE CAN,
HE CAN.
[ALOYSHA SCREAMING]
"IF." "IF."
THAT'S ALL
THEY EVER SAY.
YOUR MAJESTY,
GOD WON'T LET HIM DIE.
[ALOYSHA SCREAMS]
MAJESTY!
Natasha:
FATHER.
COME IN.
WHERE IS THE BOY?
WHO IS THIS MAN?
RASPUTIN.
WHO?
GRIGORY RASPUTIN.
HE IS A MAN OF GOD.
HE CAN CURE HIM.
HE HAS CURED MANY.
THERE WAS WOMAN
CALLED NIRUSHKIN.
SHE WAS DYING,
WASN'T SHE, FATHER?
AND THE CHILD RUN DOWN
BY HORSES.
HE HAS HEALED THEM.
HE CAN HEAL ALOYSHA.
THE DOCTORS HAVE ADMITTED
THEY'RE HELPLESS.
HE HAS THE POWER OF GOD.
LET ME PRAY
WITH YOUR SON.
ALL THE PRIESTS
IN RUSSIA ARE
PRAYING, FATHER.
I AM NO PRIEST.
I AM A SIMPLE MAN
WHO BELIEVES
GOD ANSWERS PRAYERS.
WE ARE GRATEFUL
FOR EVERYONE'S
PRAYERS.
GO TO THE CATHEDRAL.
THEY'RE ALL THERE.
THE CATHEDRAL OF GOD
IS HERE.
WHY, IF YOU COULD BELIEVE
LIKE A LITTLE CHILD,
YOU'D SAY TO ME,
"MY SON IS GETTING WELL
BECAUSE I'VE ASKED GOD
TO MAKE HIM SO,"
AND THEN GOD WOULD KNOW
THAT YOU TRUSTED HIM
AND RAISE HIM UP.
[ALOYSHA SCREAMS]
YOU TRUST DOCTORS.
DON'T YOU BELIEVE GOD
CAN DO MORE THAN THEY CAN?
IF ONLY HE COULD
BE SPARED THAT.
THERE ARE NO IFs,
MY DAUGHTER.
I CAN HEAL HIM.
WON'T YOU BELIEVE?
SAY AFTER ME,
"MY SON WILL LIVE."
MY SON WILL LIVE.
REJOICE, MY DAUGHTER.
YOUR SON WILL LIVE.
Remezov: WHO ARE YOU?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I'VE COME TO TAKE
CARE OF THE BOY.
WHO LET YOU IN HERE?
THE CZARITZA.
YOUR MAJESTY, PERMIT ME
TO FORGET THAT YOU
ARE MY SOVEREIGN.
YOU'RE A WOMAN.
THIS IS YOUR CHILD.
I AM HIS DOCTOR.
I'M GOING TO THE CZAR
AND DEMAND
THAT YOU BE KEPT AWAY
FROM HIM. THIS MADMAN
IS THE LAST STRAW.
SEND HIM AWAY.
YOU WILL GO.
YOU AND THE OTHER NURSES
REPORT AT ONCE
TO YOUR HEADQUARTERS.
IMPERIAL MAJESTY,
YOUR PHYSICIAN
IN ORDINARY
BEGS TO BE RELIEVED
OF HIS DUTIES.
HE IS ALREADY
RELIEVED.
[ALOYSHA GROANING]
MAMUSHKA.
NOW, THERE'S NO USE
CALLING HER.
SHE'S GONE.
WHAT COLOR
ARE YOUR EYES?
WHERE DID
SHE GO?
SHE WENT
TO GET A BEAUTIFUL
WHITE ELEPHANT FOR YOU
WITH PURPLE EYES
AND A SHINY GOLDEN HOUSE
ON HIS BACK.
I WANT HER.
BUT SHE'S GONE
ALL THE WAY TO THE ZOO
TO GET IT, ALOYSHA.
THAT'LL TAKE A LONG TIME.
ALOYSHA, LOOK. LOOK HERE.
LOOK AT MY WATCH.
ISN'T THAT PRETTY?
A MAN GAVE THAT TO ME ONCE
FOR MAKING HIM WELL.
HE WAS A GREAT DEAL SICKER
THAN YOU ARE, ALOYSHA.
LOOK AT IT GLITTER. LOOK.
SEE HOW IT GLITTERS?
LOOK AT IT TURN.
MAMUSHKA.
WE'RE GOING TO RIDE
IN THAT GOLDEN HOUSE,
ALOYSHA,
ON YOUR ELEPHANT
THROUGH THE BLACK,
DARK FOREST,
AND YELLOW TIGERS
ARE GOING TO BE HIDING
IN THE TREES,
AND WE'RE GOING OVER
BEAUTIFUL BLUE RIVERS
IN THE SNOW
FILLED WITH SILVER FISH.
WE'LL RIDE ON THAT ELEPHANT
OF YOURS, ALOYSHA,
ALL THE WAY
TO THE MOON, ALOYSHA.
ALL THE WAY TO THE MOON.
MAMUSHKA.
LOOK AT ME, ALOYSHA.
LOOK IN MY EYES.
THAT'S A GOOD BOY.
[SONG PLAYING]
HEAR THE BELL?
ISN'T THAT PRETTY?
KEEP LOOKING
IN MY EYES NOW.
KEEP LOOKING IN MY EYES.
THAT'S A GOOD BOY.
KEEP LOOKING
IN MY EYES, ALOYSHA.
THAT'S A GOOD BOY.
YOU DON'T FEEL BADLY
NOW, DO YOU?
YOU HAVE NO PAIN.
IT'S GONE
OUT OF YOUR BODY,
DOWN YOUR ARMS,
THROUGH YOUR HANDS,
AND OUT OF YOUR FINGERS.
NOW IT'S GOING
OUT OF THE WINDOW,
WAY UP INTO THE SKY,
AND YOU ARE GOING
TO SLEEP.
NO.
YES, YOU ARE.
YOU'RE GOING TO SLEEP.
YOUR EYES
ARE GETTING HEAVY.
NO.
YES, THEY ARE.
GOOD NIGHT, ALOYSHA.
YOU'RE GOING TO SLEEP.
LIFT UP YOUR HAND.
DROP IT.
THAT'S A GOOD LITTLE BOY.
WHO WAS IT YOU WERE
ASKING FOR A MINUTE AGO?
WHO WAS IT YOU WANTED
TO SPEAK TO?
I DON'T KNOW.
[AS ALOYSHA]
I DON'T KNOW.
[NORMAL VOICE]
AW, ISN'T THAT TOO BAD?
HE DOESN'T KNOW.
WELL, WE DON'T CARE,
BECAUSE HE'S GOING
TO SLEEP.
DEAR LITTLE BOY
IS GOING TO SLEEP.
[SONG PLAYING]
Alexandra: IT'S BEEN
A MIRACLE, DOCTOR,
A GREAT MIRACLE.
IT'S AMAZING.
I SHALL BE THE FIRST
TO ADMIT IT...
AFTER I MAKE
A SLIGHT EXAMINATION.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
OH, SEVERAL THINGS.
HAVE YOU ANY PAIN,
YOUR HIGHNESS?
HAVE YOU ANY PAIN,
ALOYSHA?
NO.
ANYTHING MORE?
YES.
I'M NOT GOING TO
HURT YOU.
DOCTOR,
I'M AN OLD FRIEND
OF HIS.
POSSIBLY, I CAN--
WELL, LIEUTENANT--
I'M SORRY, OLD MATE.
HE'S NOT
QUITE HIMSELF
YET, PAUL.
COULD YOU SIT UP,
YOUR HIGHNESS,
JUST A LITTLE BIT?
HE'LL STAUP.
HE'LL RUN
AROUND THE ROOM.
COME, ALOYSHA.
SHOW THEM
WHAT YOU CAN DO.
DON'T, YOUR HIGHNESS.
NO EXERTION, PLEASE.
YOUR MAJESTY--
DON'T YOU BELIEVE
HE'S CURED? LET GO!
PLEASE LET GO.
COME, ALOYSHA.
COME TO ME.
COME TO ME, ALOYSHA.
WE'LL SHOW THEM
WHAT TWO DAYS HAS DONE.
COME ON. COME TO ME.
COME. AH!
AH! DON'T TOUCH IT!
AH, HEY. HEY.
HA HA HA!
NOW LAUGH
AT THE DOCTOR.
LAUGH AT HIM!
LAUGH! LAUGH
AT THE DOCTOR!
LAUGH AT HIM!
ARE YOU SURE
THE DIAGNOSIS
WAS CORRECT?
YOU SAW THE RESULT
OF THE BLOOD TESTS.
I SHOULD LIKE
TO TAKE ANOTHER.
YOUR MAJESTIES,
MAY I BE ALONE
WITH THE PATIENT?
NO!
THE WAY TO LOSE
GOD'S POWER
IS TO DOUBT
HIS POWER.
DO YOU WANT
THE BOY TO DIE?
EVEN YOU SHOULD
KNOW BETTER THAN
TO TALK LIKE THAT.
GET OUT!
YOU DOCTORS HAVE
HAD YOUR CHANCE
WITH THE BOY.
YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU DID,
AND YOU'VE SEEN
WHAT GOD
HAS DONE.
NOW, WHICH
WILL YOU CHOOSE?
NO, NO.
IT ISN'T THAT,
FATHER.
WHICH WILL YOU
CHOOSE?
WE'VE ALREADY CHOSEN,
FATHER.
YOU'VE RAISED OUR SON
WHEN NONE OF YOU DOCTORS
HAVE GIVEN US ANY HOPE.
HE'S ALIVE.
I HOLD HIM IN MY ARMS.
WHO DO YOU SUPPOSE
I WOULD BELIEVE IN?
WHO DO YOU SUPPOSE
I WOULD HAVE FAITH IN?
MY DAUGHTER,
YOUR FAITH HAS
MADE HIM WHOLE.
[PEOPLE ALL TALKING
AT ONCE]
GRISHKA, SHOW THEM.
HERE'S THE HAND
THAT SHOOK THE CZAR'S.
THE CZAR SHOOK HANDS
WITH HIM.
DID HE REALLY
DO THAT, GRISHKA?
WHAT DOES HE CALL YOU,
GRISHKA? TELL THEM.
"HIS FRIEND."
Man: YOU MEAN,
HE TALKED TO YOU?
WELL, WHAT'S
SO MARVELOUS
ABOUT THAT?
HE'S JUST
AN ORDINARY
HUMAN BEING.
DOES HE REALLY
SMOKE CIGARETTES?
YEAH. YEAH.
HERE. I GOT ONE
FOR YOU.
OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL!
ONE OF THE CZAR'S
OWN CIGARETTES.
LOOK WHAT ELSE HE BROUGHT!
AW, DON'T BE SHOWING
THOSE THINGS.
AW, THEY WON'T TELL.
LOOK! LOOK AT THE EAGLES.
SOLID GOLD!
ARE YOU GOING BACK?
YES. I'VE GOT TO GO
TO THE PALACE
EVERY DAY.
Man: THIS WILL MAKE
YOUR FORTUNE, GRISHKA.
HOW MUCH
DID HE GIVE YOU?
HE DIDN'T
GIVE HIM
ANYTHING.
HE DIDN'T
GIVE HIM
A THING!
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES
THAT MAKE, YOU OLD
SHEEP'S HEAD?
THESE ARISTOCRATS
DON'T THINK ANYTHING
ABOUT MONEY.
IT WOULDN'T
SURPRISE ME
IF I GOT 200 RUBLES.
HA HA! 200 RUBLES!
HA HA! 200 RUBLES!
I MIGHT GET
500 RUBLES!
[LAUGHTER]
YEAH! I SAVED
HIS SON'S LIFE,
DIDN'T I?
[BELL RINGING]
OH, GRISHKA, YOU'RE
JUST SUCH A SWEET
LITTLE THING, YOU ARE.
AH, YOU'RE JUST
MAKING UP TO ME
BECAUSE
I'M AN IMPORTANT
MAN NOW.
NO. I LOVE YOU.
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED YOU,
GRISHKA. YOU KNOW THAT.
GIVE ME ONE--
AH, GO ON NOW! NO.
OH, GRISHKA.
GO ON.
GRISHKA!
IT'S THE CHIEF
OF THE SECRET
POLICE!
HERE. PUT THOSE THINGS
AWAY, WILL YOU?
DON'T WORRY, MY FRIENDS.
GO ON AND EAT.
GO ON. BE HAPPY.
IT'S NOTHING.
[ALL TALKING AT ONCE]
GRISHKA, I'M AFRAID.
AFRAID OF WHAT?
ARE YOU SURE YOU
DIDN'T GO TOO FAR
WITH THAT BOY?
SHH!
ARE YOU SURE
YOU DIDN'T
MAKE HIM CRAZY
LIKE THE BOY
IN KAZAN?
QUIET.
IF HE'S
GONE MAD, TOO,
THEY'LL KILL YOU.
LOOK. YOU CAN GO
OUT THAT DOOR.
I HAVEN'T ANYTHING
TO BE AFRAID OF.
I'VE DONE NOTHING.
THE BOY IS ALL RIGHT.
GET OUT OF THE WAY.
GO ON OVER THERE.
FATHER RASPUTIN?
YOUR EXCELLENCY.
I HAVE JUST COME
FROM THE PALACE.
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
MAY I, UH...
OH, YOU'RE ASKING
PERMISSION?
YOUR MODESTY
IS ALMOST CONVINCING.
YOU KNOW, FATHER,
IT HAS JUST OCCURRED TO ME
THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO HELP EACH OTHER,
YOU AND I.
REALLY?
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?
WELL, MY DEPARTMENT
HAS BEEN SUBJECT
TO A LITTLE CRITICISM
SINCE THE DEATH
OF THE GRAND DUKE SERGEI.
OH, I SEE. YOUR POST
IS IN DANGER.
WE ALL HAVE ENEMIES.
OF COURSE.
AND THE CZAR
BEING GRATEFUL
TO YOU AT THE MOMENT,
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
DROP A WORD.
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THAT I CAN INFLUENCE
THE CZAR?
OH, COME, COME,
FATHER.
YOU KNOW YOU'RE
THE MOST IMPORTANT MAN
IN RUSSIA AT THE MOMENT.
AH, I'M BEGINNING
TO UNDERSTAND.
WHAT IS THERE IN IT
FOR ME?
YOUR RECORD, FATHER,
AS FAR BACK AS TOBOLSK.
THERE ARE ONE OR TWO
LITTLE ITEMS THERE
THAT I'M SURE
YOU WOULDN'T LIKE
TO HAVE KNOWN
NOW THAT YOU'RE
WHERE YOU ARE.
MY RECORD, HUH?
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.
YOU JUST SAID I WAS
THE MOST IMPORTANT
MAN IN RUSSIA.
YOU DON'T GO
TO AN IMPORTANT MAN
AND ASK HIM
TO SAVE YOUR POST
FOR A RUBLE.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
HMM. LET ME THINK.
DO YOU KEEP
YOUR HAT ON
IN YOUR OWN HOUSE?
I BEG YOUR PARDON,
FATHER.
I'D ALMOST FORGOTTEN
ABOUT HER.
HAVE YOU GOT
THESE THINGS
ABOUT EVERYBODY?
EVERYBODY
OF CONSEQUENCE.
INFORMATION
OF THIS KIND
WOULD BE
VERY VALUABLE TO
AN INTELLIGENT MAN.
AS SOMEONE
ONCE SAID,
KNOWLEDGE IS POWER.
I'LL SAVE YOUR POST
FOR YOU.
THANK YOU, FATHER.
YES, BUT I MUST
LOOK THROUGH SOME
OF YOUR FILES.
YES. I'M GOING TO
BE MORE IMPORTANT
THAN EVEN YOU THINK.
I WON'T TOLERATE
THIS MEDDLING
IN MY DEPARTMENT.
I'M GOING TO TELL
THE CZAR.
ALL RIGHT. TELL HIM
OF THE 2 MILLION KRONEN
YOU RECEIVED FROM AUSTRIA
AND WHAT IT WAS FOR.
TELL HIM WHO PLANNED
GENERAL SABLIN'S MURDER
AND WHY YOU'RE GOING
TO MEET THE MINISTER
OF THE INTERIOR TONIGHT
AT GENERAL GADYA'S HOUSE.
I THINK YOU CAN AFFORD
TO TAKE ORDERS FROM ME,
YOUR EXCELLENCY.
AH, YOU WANT YOUR HUSBAND
PROMOTED, DON'T YOU?
YES, YES.
YES.
HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING
ABOUT GENERAL KARLOFF?
THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE DONE.
HAVE YOU OFFERED HIM
MONEY?
HE CAN'T BE BOUGHT.
HMM. YOU KNOW,
GOD HAS GIVEN ME A POWER
TO READ THE HEARTS OF MEN.
IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME
IF THIS FELLOW
HAD BEEN SELLING PLANS
OF OUR FORTIFICATIONS
TO, WELL, LET'S SAY TURKEY.
THE CZAR WOULD BE
HORRIFIED TO FIND
ANYTHING LIKE THAT OUT.
NOW, YOU TAKE SOME
OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT PLANS
AND PUT THEM
IN HIS PORTFOLIO.
THEN I'LL TELL THE CZAR
OF MY PREMONITION.
HOW DID YOU
KNOW, FATHER?
OF MYSELF,
I KNOW NOTHING.
A POWER HAS BEEN
GIVEN ME TO READ
THE HEARTS OF MEN.
IF IT HAS HELPED RUSSIA,
I THANK GOD.
[TCHAIKOVSKY'S
WALTZ OF THE FLOWERS PLAYING]
Natasha: I HOPE
YOU'RE NOT ANGRY
WITH FATHER RASPUTIN
FOR NOT COMING.
OF COURSE NOT, DARLING.
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I VERY SELDOM ATTEND
DINNERS GIVEN TO ME.
BUT I USUALLY NOTIFY
MY HOST.
HE DIDN'T MEAN
TO BE RUDE,
BUT HE LIVES IN SUCH
A WORLD OF HIS OWN
THAT PEOPLE AND TIME
AND DINNERS DON'T MEAN
ANYTHING TO HIM.
I SEE. WELL,
ALWAYS REMEMBER
I ASKED HIM.
AT LEAST
THAT'S OVER.
WAS IT SUCH AN ORDEAL,
AFTER ALL HE'S DONE
FOR ALOYSHA?
DARLING,
IF A WITCH DOCTOR
HAD HEALED ALOYSHA,
HE COULD HAVE
EVERYTHING I'VE GOT
IN THE WORLD,
BUT I DON'T
LIKE HIM,
AND I NEVER SHALL.
YOU NEVER TRIED TO.
IT ISN'T THAT.
THERE'S SOMETHING
CLAMMY ABOUT HIM.
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.
I'VE HAD
THE SAME FEELING
BRUSHING
AGAINST SOMETHING
ON A DARK NIGHT.
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S AFTER,
BUT I GET A SORT
OF FEELING OF A MAN
WAITING HIS CHANCE.
PAUL!
YOU DRAGGED IT
OUT OF ME, DARLING.
HAVE YOU EVER
WATCHED HIM
WITH PEOPLE?
HE GOES AS FAR
AS HE DARES, EVEN
WITH THE EMPRESS.
YOU DON'T LIKE HIM
BECAUSE HE'S
SO OUTSPOKEN.
YOU DON'T LIKE
HIS MANNERS.
ISN'T THAT IT?
NO, THAT'S NOT IT.
IT'S--
IT'S HIS SMILE.
IT'S LIKE
A MAN-EATING SHARK
WITH A BIBLE
UNDER HIS FIN.
PAUL, I'VE NEVER
SEEN YOU LIKE THIS
BEFORE.
DARLING,
I CAN'T HELP IT.
PAUL, I BELIEVE IN HIM,
IN HIS SINCERITY,
HIS DIVINE POWER.
NO ONE CAN SHAKE
MY FAITH IN HIM,
NOT EVEN YOU.
I KNOW IT, AND
I HATE YOUR BELIEF
IN HIM. I HATE IT.
EVERYTHING THAT'S
COME BETWEEN US
I BLAME ON HIM.
AH, WELL, DARLING...
LET'S HAVE
SOME MORE CHAMPAGNE.
Man: GRIGORY
YEFIMOVICH RASPUTIN.
HMM. THERE HE IS.
PAUL, NOTHING HAS COME
BETWEEN US.
PLEASE BE NICE TO HIM.
OF COURSE, DARLING.
I'LL BE A PEARL
AMONG HOSTS.
EXCUSE ME.
PARDON ME, GENERAL.
WE WERE WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.
WHY?
DINNER WAS
AT 8:00. WE WAITED
UNTIL 10:00.
PERHAPS I CAN
GET YOU SOMETHING
ON A TRAY.
[BURP]
NO, THANK YOU.
I JUST HAD SOME
WONDERFUL BORSCHT.
LITTLE FRIEND OF MINE
MAKES IT.
WHO ARE ALL THESE PEOPLE?
I'M ABOUT
TO PRESENT YOU.
I'LL TELL YOU
WHO I WANT TO KNOW.
OH, VERY WELL.
WELL, MY DEAR CHILD,
YOU LOOK VERY BEAUTIFUL.
IS THIS THE FAMOUS
FATHER RASPUTIN?
AM I?
YOU'RE ALL ANYONE
TALKS ABOUT.
ALL OF US CAME HERE
JUST TO SEE YOU.
I GAVE UP
A TRIP TO LONDON.
YOU SEE,
I'VE BEEN AN INVALID
FOR NEARLY 12 YEARS.
OH? WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?
NONE OF THE DOCTORS
SEEM TO KNOW.
I'VE HAD THEM ALL.
WELL,
I'LL TELL YOU.
YES?
YOU'RE A LAZY,
SPOILED WOMAN.
IF YOU WERE TO SCRAPE SOME
OF THAT ROUGE OFF YOUR FACE
AND GET BEHIND
A WASHTUB,
YOU'D BE ALL RIGHT
IN A WEEK.
SIR!
HE'S WONDERFUL!
A WASHTUB!
HOW DIVINE!
I WARNED YOU.
WHO IS THAT MAN?
I LIKE HIS FACE.
THAT'S KROPOTKIN.
HE'S A BRILLIANT
CREATURE.
HE'S HELPING ME
RESTORE THE DUMA.
COME AND MEET HIM.
PROFESSOR KROPOTKIN,
UNIVERSITY OF
ST. PETERSBURG.
GENERAL LINOFF,
OUR MINISTER OF WAR.
AND HIS EXCELLENCY
THE GERMAN
AMBASSADOR,
COUNT CARTALES.
FATHER RASPUTIN.
OH, I AM DELIGHTED
TO SEE YOU, INDEED.
THANK YOU.
SO YOU'RE
KROPOTKIN, HUH?
I'M AFRAID SO.
OH! TOBOLSK CAKES!
WHERE DID THEY
COME FROM?
NATASHA SAID
YOU LIKED THEM, SIR.
NO! DID YOU
REMEMBER THAT?
WELL, THAT'S
VERY SWEET,
MY DAUGHTER.
Paul: NATASHA.
GENERAL LINOFF
IS AWFULLY BORED.
GO AND FLATTER HIM
A LITTLE.
BUT, PAUL, I--
PLEASE.
AW, DON'T
TAKE HER AWAY.
SORRY.
EXCUSE ME.
AH, KROPOTKIN...
I WAS TALKING
TO THE CZAR
ABOUT YOU
THIS MORNING.
OH, YOU WERE?
LOOK HERE,
WHY DO YOU WANT
TO HAND OUT RIGHTS
TO A LOT
OF SLOBBERING
PEASANTS?
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN
THE FRENCH REVOLUTION?
DON'T YOU THINK
THE PEASANT HAS
ANY RIGHTS?
NO. IT'S ONE
OF THE LUXURIES
OF THE RICH
TO FEEL SORRY
FOR THE COMMON HERD,
BUT I KNOW THEM.
THEY'RE BORN TO THE LATH.
LET THEM HAVE IT.
THIS IS THE WILL
OF GOD.
WILL YOU PARDON US
A MOMENT, SIR?
FATHER RASPUTIN
AND I HAVE SOMETHING
TO DISCUSS ALONE.
I DON'T GO
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS.
BUT I WANT TO ASK
YOUR ADVICE
ABOUT THE SITUATION
IN THE BALTIC.
YOU CAN ASK MY ADVICE
ABOUT ANYTHING RIGHT HERE.
PERHAPS WE'RE,
UH, DISTURBING
THE LADIES.
OH, EXCUSE
MY PEASANT MANNERS.
THIS WAY, FATHER,
PLEASE.
WHAT'S THIS
COCK-AND-BULL STORY
ABOUT THE BALTIC?
SIT DOWN.
HAVE A CIGAR.
I TRUST
YOU DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS RUDE OF ME
TO TAKE YOU
AWAY FROM THOSE
DELIGHTFUL PEOPLE.
HA HA!
DELIGHTFUL PEOPLE!
YOU SEE, FATHER,
YOU'RE BY WAY
OF BEING
A STRANGER AT COURT,
AREN'T YOU?
YEAH.
AND ALTHOUGH
YOU'VE MADE A VERY
GREAT SUCCESS
WITH THE ROYAL
FAMILY,
YOU MIGHT WANT
A LITTLE ADVICE.
ADVICE? ABOUT WHAT?
WELL, A MAN
IN YOUR POSITION--
YESTERDAY NOBODY,
TODAY A HERO,
TRUSTED
BY HER MAJESTY,
ALMOST WORSHIPPED.
SUCH A MAN MIGHT--
I WON'T SAY
HE WOULD--
BUT HE MIGHT
LET SUCCESS
GO TO HIS HEAD,
MIGHTN'T HE?
HMM. COME TO THE POINT.
SAY WHAT YOU WANT.
WELL,
IF YOU'RE WISE,
YOU WON'T MEDDLE
IN MATTERS THAT
DO NOT CONCERN YOU.
SUCH AS?
THE DUMA, MY FRIEND.
DUMA?
THE DUMA CONCERNS ME
VERY MUCH.
SOMEDAY, I'M GOING TO RUN
THIS COUNTRY.
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
MY TOES STEPPED ON
BY A LOT
OF IGNORANT PEASANTS
WITH POLITICAL
IDEAS.
OH, THAT'S IT, IS IT?
THE POWER
BEHIND THE THRONE, EH?
YES. YOU MIGHT
AS WELL KNOW IT NOW
AS ANY OTHER TIME.
GET USED TO IT,
PRINCE.
JUST, UH, WHERE
DID YOU PICK UP THESE
DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR?
YOU THINK I'M DIRT,
DON'T YOU?
HMM.
JUST AN IGNORANT
PRIEST
TO KNEEL BEFORE
FOR A MIRACLE.
WELL, YOU NEVER MADE
A GREATER MISTAKE.
I KNOW MY DESTINY.
I KNOW MY POWER.
IT'S GROWING,
GROWING
EVERY MINUTE.
AS LONG AS THE LIFE
OF THAT BOY DEPENDS
ON MY WILL,
IT'LL GO ON GROWING
AND GROWING
UNTIL THIS COURT
OF YOURS ROTS.
THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE
AND THEIR RIGHTS!
WHY, YOU
PAMPERED FOOL!
INSIDE OF A YEAR,
IN LETHAN A YEAR,
I WILL BE RUSSIA!
DO YOU HEAR THAT?
I! RASPUTIN!
YOU KNOW,
PEOPLE WITH AMBITIONS
LIKE YOURS,
MY DEAR FATHER,
ARE SOMETIMES
RATHER UNLUCKY.
AH, INDEED?
YES. THERE WAS
A GENERAL NOT LONG AGO
WHO SHOT HIMSELF
IN THE BACK.
NO ONE COULD UNDERSTAND
QUITE HOW HE DID IT.
AH, YOU THINK
I'M FRIGHTENED BY
THREATS OF MURDER?
OH, MURDER. THAT'S
SUCH AN UGLY WORD.
WHEN THE RIGHTS
OF 160 MILLION PEOPLE
ARE AT STAKE...
THEY CALL IT PROGRESS.
YOUR HIGHNESS,
ONCE MORE PLEASE.
[SPEAKING GERMAN]
YOUR HIGHNESS,
PLEASE GIVE ME
YOUR ATTENTION.
NOW, PLEASE
REPEAT AFTER ME.
NACH FRANKREICH...
NACH...NACH...
PLEASE PAY ATTENTION
TO ME, YOUR HIGHNESS.
LET HIM ALONE.
ACH,
DU LIEBER GOTT.
BUT HIS HIGHNESS
IS FORGETTING
ALL HIS GERMAN.
GOOD! IF GOD WANTED
HIM TO LEARN GERMAN,
HE'D HAVE BEEN BORN
IN GERMANY.
BUT HER MAJESTY
IS VERY MUCH
CONCERNED.
WHO'S IN CHARGE
OF THE BOY? YOU OR ME?
I AM IN CHARGE
OF HIS HIGHNESS'
GERMAN LESSONS.
CLEAR OUT!
AND I SHALL
REPORT THIS
TO HER MAJESTY.
GET OUT, YOU KRAUTHEAD,
YOU DRIED-UP SAUSAGE.
YOUR
HIGHNESS.
GERMAN MONKEY.
WHAT CAN
A SQUIRT LIKE THAT
TEACH YOU, HUH?
NOW, WHERE IS
THAT THING OF REMEZOV'S
THAT WE WERE LOOKING
THROUGH THE OTHER DAY
WHEN WE WERE WATCHING
THE SPIDER?
THE MICROSCOPE?
HA HA! NOW
WE'LL SEE SOMETHING.
I--I DON'T WANT TO!
COME HERE!
SIT DOWN.
SIT DOWN.
NOW, TODAY WE HAVE
SOMETHING BETTER THAN
THE SPIDER, ALOYSHA--
A BIG FAT FLY.
OH! NO. IT'S AN ANT.
LOOK AT HIM
TRY TO GET AWAY,
BUT HE CAN'T.
NOW, WE COULD KILL HIM
JUST LIKE THAT,
BUT WE WON'T.
GIVE ME THE BOX.
CLOSE IT UP.
NOW...
HERE'S THE FLY,
A NICE BIG FAT ONE.
LOOK AT HIM.
HE LOOKS ALMOST
LIKE A GENERAL,
DOESN'T HE, ALOYSHA?
ALL NOISE
AND PATENT LEATHER,
OPEN IT.
CLOSE IT. PUT IT THERE.
NOW, SUPPOSE THOSE TWO
SHOULD START IN FIGHTING.
I DON'T WANT
TO WATCH THEM FIGHT.
YES, YOU DO.
YOU'RE GOING TO WATCH
AND LEARN.
LOOK.
WHO DO YOU THINK
WILL WIN?
YOU'D SAY THE FLY,
BIG GENERAL FLY,
BUT THAT LITTLE ANT
HAS POWER,
AND HE KNOWS
HOW TO USE IT.
POWER IS THE ONLY THING
IN THE WORLD,
BUT YOU MUST KNOW
HOW TO USE IT.
LET ME LOOK AT IT.
LOOK. HA HA!
LOOK AT THE BIG
JUICY FLY,
THE STUPID
ARISTOCRAT.
OH, NO, NO, NO.
BUT THE ANT HAS HIM.
LOOK.
SEE HOW HE'S MOVING
UP ON THE FLY?
THE GENERAL
IS IN FOR IT NOW.
THAT'S IT! LOOK!
LOOK! LOOK! LOOK!
HE'S FIGHTING,
BUT IT'S NOT GOING
TO DO HIM ANY GOOD,
BECAUSE
THE ANT KNOWS
HOW TO USE POWER,
AND HE DOESN'T.
POOR GENERAL.
FIRST CRIPPLE
AND THEN DESTROY.
I DON'T WANT TO WATCH!
YOU'LL WATCH
AND LEARN.
NOW...
LOOK! LOOK! LOOK!
HE'S GOT HIS WING.
HE'S GOT
THE ARISTOCRAT.
HE'S GOT
THE GENERAL NOW.
HERE. LET ME LOOK.
HE'S TAKING HIM
APART.
HE'S EATING HIM UP.
HA HA!
THAT'S THE KIND
OF POWER WE CAN
HAVE, YOU AND I,
IF YOU DO
AS I TELL YOU.
WE CAN HAVE RUSSIA!
YOU'LL REMEMBER
THAT?
YES.
THAT'S A GOOD BOY,
A VERY GOOD BOY.
WE'LL HAVE RUSSIA,
YOU AND I, ALOYSHA.
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE THE FLY,
AND I'M THE ANT,
BUT I'LL ALWAYS BE
YOUR FRIEND.
NOW, LET'S SEE.
WHERE IS RUSSIA?
I DON'T SEEM TO BE
ABLE TO FIND IT.
WHERE IS IT, ALOYSHA?
THIS IS IT!
HA HA! THAT'S IT!
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
SPIN IT! HA HA! RUSSIA!
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
THOUGHT I'D FIND OUT
WHAT WAS SO AMUSING.
WE WERE LAUGHING
ABOUT THE DUMA.
WHAT'S HAPPENED
ABOUT IT?
I THOUGHT IT WAS
TO BE SIGNED TODAY.
NEVER MIND THAT.
THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT.
HELLO, ALOYSHA.
LITTLE LIEUTENANT.
LOOK AT ME.
ALOYSHA, IT'S PAUL.
ALOYSHA!
WHAT DAMNABLE THING
IS THIS?
IT ISN'T MY FAULT
THAT HE DOESN'T
LIKE YOU.
YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING
TO HIS MIND.
ALOYSHA,
WHAT'S HE DONE TO YOU?
TELL ME.
WE'LL GO TO YOUR MOTHER.
DO YOU THINK
SHE'D BELIEVE YOU?
YOU FILTHY SWINE!
MEDDLING IN POLITICS
IS ONE THING...
BUT IF YOU'VE TAMPERED
WITH THIS BOY'S SOUL--
LET ME ALONE.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
TO HIM?!
PAUL!
Paul: MAJESTY,
ALOYSHA--
LOOK AT HIM!
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH HIM?
AH, HE'S
FRIGHTENED,
NATURALLY.
IT'S ALL RIGHT,
MY BOY.
GO TO
YOUR MOTHER.
DON'T BE
AFRAID. HE WON'T
HURT ME.
LOOK AT HIS EYES.
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH HIS EYES?
IS IT BECAUSE
HE WASN'T GLAD
TO SEE YOU?
WHAT DO YOU SAY
TO YOUR MOTHER,
ALOYSHA?
I LOVE YOU,
MAMUSHKA.
I LOVE YOU, DARLING.
MAJESTY, A MOMENT AGO,
HE WAS DIFFERENT,
SHOCKINGLY DIFFERENT!
IS IT BECAUSE
HE DIDN'T WANT
YOU TO MAUL HIM?
HE HURT ME!
ALOYSHA!
THEN HE SAID
HE'D KILL
FATHER
GRISHKA.
ALOYSHA,
THAT ISN'T TRUE!
HE DIDN'T
MEAN IT.
I KNEW THAT.
PAUL, YOU DIDN'T
SAY THAT!
MAJESTY, MAY I SAY
ONE THING?
PAUL...
THERE IS NOTHING
TO BE SAID.
PLEASE LEAVE US.
[RINGING]
[CROWD TALKING]
Woman: IS THIS
FATHER RASPUTIN'S FLAT?
Different woman:
COME IN. SIT DOWN.
I'LL GET TO YOU LATER.
TONIA.
I'VE SENT HIM WORD,
YOUR HONOR.
HE SAID HE CAN'T MAKE
A MINISTER OUT OF A MISER.
IF HE WILL
JUST READ--
TAKE YOUR TURN, COLONEL.
MY LADY WOULD
LIKE TO SEE FATHER
RASPUTIN AT ONCE.
YES. WOULD SHE?
SO WOULD A LOT OF
OTHER PRETTY SQUABS.
LISTEN HERE, THEN.
MY MISTRESS IS NATALIA,
LADY-IN-WAITING
TO THE EMPRESS.
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME? PARDON.
Tonia: YOUR HIGHNESS.
THERE ARE SO MANY
OF THE OTHER KIND
COME HERE.
I DIDN'T KNOW.
COME INSIDE,
YOUR HIGHNESS,
AND I'LL TELL HIM.
I WON'T BE
A MOMENT.
Man: FATHER WAS GOING
TO GET MY BROTHER
OUT OF JAIL.
HE'LL TAKE CARE OF
THAT. COME INSIDE,
YOUR HIGHNESS.
TONIA, PLEASE!
[WOMEN SINGING]
[CROWD TALKING]
Woman: FATHER,
LET ME TOUCH--
Tonia:
NATALIA'S HERE.
MY DAUGHTER.
[SILENCE]
[MURMURING]
WHAT'S SHE
DOING HERE?
MY DAUGHTER.
THIS WAY, MY DAUGHTER.
BLESSED AMONG WOMEN,
THIS IS THE WAY
OF HOLINESS!
CHILDREN HAPPY
IN THEIR FAITH.
Woman: FATHER,
I MUST TALK TO YOU.
THERE'S SOMETHING
TROUBLING ME THAT
I MUST KNOW NOW.
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS BLESS
THE YOUNG AND PRETTY ONES?
LISTEN TO ME. IF YOU
KEEP THIS UP, I'LL BREAK
YOUR THICK SKULL.
[WOMEN SINGING]
FATHER!
I HOPE YOU WEREN'T
UPSET BY THOSE
SIMPLE PEOPLE.
YOU LOOK ANXIOUS,
MY DAUGHTER.
FATHER, I'M SORRY
TO INTRUDE ON YOU
LIKE THIS, BUT--
NO, THANK YOU.
I HAVE TO WARN YOU.
YOUR LIFE MAY BE
IN DANGER.
MY LIFE?
CHEGODIEFF.
YES, BUT DON'T TELL HIM.
IT'S BECAUSE I LOVE HIM
THAT I CAME HERE, SO THAT
NOTHING WILL HAPPEN.
NOTHING IS
GOING TO HAPPEN,
MY DAUGHTER.
LET ME TAKE
YOUR COAT.
YOU'RE GOING
TO GET COLD.
NO, REALLY, I--
OH, I SEE.
MY HOME IS
TOO HUMBLE.
OH, PLEASE.
THAT'S BETTER.
I'VE BEEN
SO TERRIBLY WORRIED.
WELL, DON'T BE.
THEY'VE HAD
MANY A GO AT ME--
THESE ARISTOCRATS.
THEY CAN'T STOMACH
THE POWER GOD
HAS GIVEN ME.
I SEE THROUGH THEM
AND THEIR LITTLE
SCHEMES.
BUT IT ISN'T PAUL'S
FAULT. THEY'VE POISONED
HIS MIND AGAINST YOU.
HE WAS NEVER
LIKE THIS BEFORE.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
WHO IS IT?
TONIA.
HE'LL SEE EVENTUALLY,
BUT BE CAREFUL.
YES. DON'T WORRY.
NOBODY'S GOING
TO KILL ME.
NOBODY CAN.
[LOUD KNOCKING]
EXCUSE ME.
I'LL SEE WHAT
IT IS SHE WANTS.
WHAT ARE YOU POUNDING
ON THE DOOR FOR?
GRISHKA,
PRINCE CHEGODIEFF.
WHAT ABOUT HIM?
HE INSISTS
ON SEEING YOU.
GRISHKA,
HE MEANS TROUBLE.
TAKE HIM UP THE BACK WAY
TO THE KITCHEN.
HEY. PSST. YOU THERE
IN THE CORNER.
I CAN SEE YOU.
CAN YOU SEE
ALL RIGHT?
Paul:
YES, THANK YOU.
IT ISN'T MUCH
LIKE YOUR HOUSE,
IS IT, PRINCE?
SMELLS A LITTLE
DIFFERENTLY.
THIS WAY,
YOUR EXCELLENCY.
THIS WAY.
[WOMEN SINGING]
YOU KNOW, MY NECK
IS BLACK AND BLUE
WHERE YOU CHOKED ME.
HA HA!
YOU WANT
TO SHAKE HANDS?
I'M WILLING.
SORRY. I HAVEN'T
MY GLOVES ON.
OH, STILL, YOU MUST
HAVE SOME REASON
FOR HONORING
MY HUMBLE FLAT.
ARE YOU LOOKING
FOR SOMEONE?
YOU.
DO YOU REMEMBER--
I TOLD YOU ONCE
SOMETHING ABOUT
PROGRESS?
I MEANT IT.
[SHOUTING]
THIS IS FOR RUSSIA.
GRAB HIM!
[GUNSHOTS]
Paul:
I COULDN'T HAVE
MISSED HIM.
Tonia: WHAT'S THAT SHOOTING?
WHAT HAS HAPPENED?
HE TRIED
TO KILL ME,
BUT THERE'S A POWER
WATCHING OVER ME
STRONGER THAN ANY BULLET.
THAT POWER WON'T
HELP YOU NEXT TIME.
I'LL AIM AT YOUR HEAD.
[WOMEN SHOUTING]
TELL YOUR SUPERIORS
THEY CAN FIND ME
AT THE BARRACKS
OF THE CHEVALIER
GUARDS.
NEXT TIME.
Rasputin: GO BACK,
MY CHILDREN. GO BACK.
I WANT TO BE ALONE.
Tonia: GO BACK.
GO BACK. GO BACK.
NEVER MIND HIM.
A MIRACLE
HAS BEEN PERFORMED.
Women: ALLELUIA!
A MIRACLE.
[WOMEN SINGING]
HAS HE GONE?
YES.
A GREAT MIRACLE.
LOOK HERE, I'LL
REPORT THIS LITTLE
AFFAIR, NOT YOU.
YOU UNDERSTAND?
YES.
GO ON. GET OUT.
THERE HE GOES,
TONIA.
THAT FELLA
CHEGODIEFF ISN'T
AFRAID OF ANYTHING.
I'VE GOT TO
GET RID OF HIM.
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE NOT HURT,
GRISHKA?
NO. THIS WAS
A GOOD IDEA, THOUGH.
THAT FIRST BULLET
ALMOST KNOCKED
THE WIND OUT OF ME.
IT MIGHT HAVE
KILLED YOU.
IT MIGHT, INDEED.
I COULDN'T HAVE
DIED NOW, TONIA,
JUST AS I'M WITHIN
REACH OF EVERYTHING.
THERE'S GOING
TO BE A WAR.
DO YOU REALIZE THAT,
OLD CABBAGE-FACE?
THERE'S GOING
TO BE A WAR.
NAPOLEON NEEDED A WAR.
WELL, I'VE GOT ONE.
I WONDER IF YOU KNOW
WHAT A GREAT MAN
YOU'RE WITH, TONIA.
WHY DON'T YOU GO
TO THE CZAR RIGHT NOW?
OH, ONE THING
AT A TIME,
OLD CABBAGE-FACE.
THIS WHOLE
LITTLE STORY HERE
WILL FIT A MUCH
BETTER OCCASION.
KEEP THEM UP.
I HEARD A SHOT.
YES, MY DAUGHTER.
IT WAS PAUL.
[BAND PLAYING]
[DOOR OPENS]
MY DAUGHTER...
THIS CONCERNS
ALOYSHA.
HIS LIFE MAY
DEPEND ON IT.
COME WITH ME.
CONTINUE THE REVIEW
UNTIL THE END.
GENERAL STAFF
WILL FOLLOW ME.
[TRUMPETING CALL]
NICKY,
WHAT IS IT?
OUR COUSIN WILHELM HAS
ORDERED ME TO DEMOBILIZE
UNDER PENALTY OF WAR.
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?
EVERYTHING IN MY POWER
TO SAVE EUROPE
FROM THIS INSANITY.
GOD GRANT YOU
WISDOM.
AMEN.
I'LL DO ALL I CAN
WITH HONOR.
I'LL MEET THE GENERAL STAFF
IN MY STUDY.
I'VE JUST SPOKEN
WITH THE AMBASSADOR.
HE'S SURE THAT ENGLAND
WILL BE IN ACCORD BUT
CAN MAKE NO PROMISES.
EL PANKORE
WILL BE AT SEA
FOR TWO MORE DAYS.
THE KAISER HAS CHOSEN
AN AWKWARD MOMENT
FOR HIS ULTIMATUM.
Nikolai: GENTLEMEN.
GERMANY DEMANDS
THAT WE DEMOBILIZE.
OUR REFUSAL MAY LEAD
TO WAR.
WE HAVE A TERRIBLE
RESPONSIBILITY TO FACE.
I BEG YOU NOT TO LET PASSION
OR MISTAKEN PATRIOTISM
COLOR YOUR JUDGMENT.
THE PEACE OF EUROPE
RESTS WITH US.
I HAVE PRESERVED IT
FOR 30 YEARS.
WE MUST KEEP IT NOW.
YOUR MAJESTY,
MAY I SUGGEST
THAT THE BEST WAY
TO PRESERVE PEACE AT
THIS PRESENT MOMENT
IS TO SHOW GERMANY
THAT WE ARE READY
TO ENFORCE PEACE?
I AGREE WITH
THE MINISTER
OF WAR.
SO DO I.
IF WE DEMOBILIZE,
AUSTRIA WILL TAKE IT
AS A SIGN THAT WE'RE
GOING TO STAND
WEAKLY BY WHILE
SHE CRUSHES SERBIA.
INSTEAD OF
PREVENTING A WAR,
WE CAUSE ONE.
ON THE OTHER HAND, IF WE
DEMOBILIZE, IT MIGHT REMOVE ALL
THE TENSION FROM THE SITUATION.
IT MAY MOVE THIS CRISIS
BACK TO THE BALKANS,
WHERE IT BELONGS.
SERBIA'S CASE
COULD BE ARBITRATED.
NO, YOUR MAJESTY.
IT IS QUITE OBVIOUS
WHAT YOUR INFERIOR
COUSIN IS DOING.
GERMANY IS HOLDING
AUSTRIA'S COAT
WHILE SERBIA
IS DESTROYED.
THIS IMPUDENT ULTIMATUM
IS A BLUFF TO KEEP US
FROM INTERFERING
WITH THE MURDER
OF A NATION.
THE KAISER'S NOT
INCLINED TO BLUFF.
IT WILL COST US
A MILLION MEN
TO FIND THAT OUT.
NOW YOU'RE OVERRATING
THE GERMANS A BIT.
IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY,
YOU, AT ONE TIME,
UNDERRATED THE JAPANESE.
BERLIN IS ON
THE TELEPHONE NOW,
AWAITING OUR DECISION.
WHAT POSSIBLE
CHOICE HAVE WE?
YOUR MAJESTY,
I DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN
TURN OUR BACKS NOW.
WE ARE PLEDGED
TO PROTECT SERBIA.
Paul: SURELY.
WE'RE ALSO PLEDGED
TO PROTECT RUSSIA,
YOUR EXCELLENCY.
I HAVE SEEN
GERMANY'S ARMY.
WITH ALL RESPECT
TO YOUR MINISTRY,
SIR,
WE ARE NOT PREPARED.
[MEN TALKING]
YOU'RE NOT
IN THE BEST POSITION
TO KNOW, COLONEL.
[MEN TALKING]
GENTLEMEN, THE CONSEQUENCES
OF WHATEVER WE MAY DECIDE HERE
ARE MORE THAN I CAN FACE
WITHOUT THE HELP OF GOD.
I WISH TO BE ALONE
FOR A MOMENT.
MY SON...
I KNOW
EVERYTHING THAT'S
IN YOUR HEART.
IT IS VERY HEAVY.
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
IN THE WILL OF GOD.
WHY DO YOU WANT TO
BOW TO THE KAISER?
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?
YOUR EYES ARE
FULL OF IT.
MY SON, IF YOU
FOLLOW THIS COURSE,
IT WILL BE THE END
OF RUSSIA.
YOU KNOW THE KAISER'S
AMBITIONS IN THE EAST.
THIS IS THE FIRST STEP.
THE NEXT, THE TURKS WILL
CLOSE UP THE BLACK SEA.
FATHER, I NEED YOUR
SPIRITUAL ADVICE MORE THAN
YOUR POLITICAL OPINIONS.
BUT YOU YOURSELF
HAVE TOLD ME,
A GUN IS POINTING
TOWARD RUSSIA.
I FELT THAT SOMETHING
LED ME HERE.
BESIDES HEALING ALOYSHA,
I'VE BEEN ORDAINED
TO SAVE HIS THRONE.
BE FIRM, AND IT WILL
ENDURE FOREVER.
TELL THE KAISER THAT YOU
REMAIN THE PROTECTOR
OF THE WEAK,
THAT YOU ARE
STILL THE CZAR.
Paul:
OUT OF THE WAY.
FORGIVE
THIS INTERRUPTION,
YOUR MAJESTY,
BUT CIRCUMSTANCES
JUSTIFY IT.
YOUR FOREIGN
MINISTER HAS
JUST RECEIVED
ANOTHER DEMAND
FROM BERLIN,
AND YOU ARE
WITH THE MAN
WHOSE ADVICE
HAS CREATED
THE SITUATION,
THE MAN THAT
WAS UNDERMINING
YOUR GOVERNMENT.
WHAT IS THE MEANING
OF THIS?
YOUR MAJESTY,
THIS MAN WISHES
RUSSIA TO GO TO WAR.
THIS MEANS
THE DESTRUCTION
OF YOUR COUNTRY,
THE END OF
YOUR DYNASTY.
YOUR ADVISERS WILL
TELL YOU OTHERWISE
BECAUSE THEY
NO LONGER ARE
YOUR ADVISERS.
ALL THE PEOPLE
DEVOTED TO YOU,
ALL THE PEOPLE
LOYAL TO YOU
ARE GONE.
THESE MEN ARE
HIS CREATURES.
THERE ARE LIMITS
TO MY FRIENDSHIP,
PRINCE.
NO, NO, MY SON.
YOU MUST HEAR HIM OUT.
IF I AM ALL HE ACCUSES
ME OF BEING, I DON'T
DESERVE YOUR TRUST.
LET US HAVE THE TRUTH.
I SAY THAT HE IS
PLUNGING US INTO WAR,
BUT YOU MUST DECIDE.
BY WHAT RIGHT DO YOU
BURST IN HERE WITH THESE
RECKLESS ACCUSATIONS?
BY THE SAME RIGHT,
SIR, THAT I WENT TO
HIS FLAT LAST NIGHT
AND TRIED
TO KILL HIM,
THE RIGHT EVERY MAN
HAS TO PROTECT
HIS COUNTRY
AGAINST HER ENEMIES.
YOU DID WHAT?!
SIR, I WAS HOPING
TODAY YOU'D BE SIGNING
MY DEATH WARRANT,
THAT I'D BE DEAD,
BUT SO WOULD HE,
AND THE NIGHTMARE
OF THIS HOLY LEECH
WOULD BE OVER FOREVER.
YES. YES, HE
TRIED TO KILL ME.
WHY DIDN'T YOU
COME TO ME?
WITH ALL YOUR BURDENS?
IF GOD SENT ME HERE
TO SAVE ALOYSHA,
SURELY HE CAN
PROTECT ME.
YOU KNEW ALOYSHA'S
LIFE DEPENDED
ON HIM.
AND THEY COULD PLAY
THEIR LITTLE GAME
UNDISTURBED.
ISN'T THAT IT?
SIR, YOU KNOW
I LOVE ALOYSHA.
WHY DO YOU
WANT HIM TO DIE?
I DON'T,
BUT I'D RATHER SEE
HIM DEAD THAN WHAT
YOU'VE MADE HIM.
ABOVE EVERYTHING
ON EARTH,
I LOVE MY SON.
I THOUGHT
YOU DID.
OH, SIR,
IN ALL SINCERITY,
IT WAS AS MUCH FOR ALOYSHA
AS FOR RUSSIA.
I HAVE NEVER QUESTIONED
YOUR SINCERITY.
I DO, YOUR SANITY.
I HAVE BEEN SWAYED
BY MANY INFLUENCES,
BUT ONE INFLUENCE
HAS NEVER SWAYED ME--
ATTEMPTS TO ASSASSINATE
MY ADVISERS, MY FAMILY,
OR MYSELF.
YOUR RESIGNATION
IS ACCEPTED.
WELL,
WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?
GOD MOVES
IN A MYSTERIOUS WAY.
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
BELIEVED ME.
HE HAD TO REVEAL
HIMSELF.
NOW YOU KNOW
YOUR ENEMIES.
GO, MY SON.
PROTECT HOLY RUSSIA.
[BAND PLAYING]
CHEVALIER GUARDS.
Man: ATTENTION!
ALIX, AM I RIGHT
IN GOING?
YES, MY DEAR.
YES, BUT TAKING OVER
THE ENTIRE COMMAND--
THE RESPONSIBILITY
FRIGHTENS ME.
OTHERS ARE BETTER
TRAINED FOR WAR.
I HAVE NO STOMACH
FOR THE SLAUGHTER.
BUT YOU MUST
REMEMBER WHAT FATHER
RASPUTIN SAID.
IT IS ONLY YOU
WHO CAN GIVE
RUSSIA COURAGE.
YES.
YOU'LL WRITE TO ME
WHEN YOU CAN?
EVERY DAY.
LOOK OUT
FOR METCHNIKOFF.
OUR FRIEND
DOESN'T TRUST HIM.
I USED TO THINK ALL
THE MEN AROUND ME
WERE LOYAL...
BEFORE HE OPENED
MY EYES.
HAD TO BE DONE,
NICKY.
I KNOW.
EVER SINCE, I HAVEN'T
LIKED THE TASTE
OF MY HEART.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
YES?
IT'S 9:30,
YOUR MAJESTY.
I'M COMING
IMMEDIATELY.
GOOD-BYE, BELOVED.
NOT YET, ALIX.
FIGHT WELL,
MY EMPEROR.
ALIX DEAR.
FEAR GOD...
AND NO ONE ELSE.
[MAN SHOUTING]
HURRY BACK TO ME.
[TRUMPET CALL SOUNDING]
[WHISTLE BLOWING]
[ENGINE CHUGGING]
TELL ME, ALOYSHA,
HOW DOES YOUR FATHER
SIT IN THIS CHAIR?
DOES HE PUT
HIS ELBOWS ON IT,
OR DOES HE SIT
LIKE THIS?
YOU BETTER NOT LET
PAPA KNOW YOU SAT
IN HIS CHAIR.
HE'D BE TERRIBLY UPSET.
Rasputin: THERE ARE
A LOT OF PEOPLE
IN TOBOLSK
WHO'D LIKE
TO SEE ME NOW.
I WAS HUNGRY
AND COLD THERE.
COME HERE,
MY CHILD.
COME HERE.
COME HERE.
YOU SEEM AFRAID
OF ME LATELY. WHY?
ALOYSHA, GO AND FIND
YOUR SISTER.
TAKE--TAKE ANASTASIA
WITH YOU.
I WANT TO SEE
OLGA, TOO.
NO, NO. THERE'S
SOMETHING I HAVE
TO TELL YOU FIRST.
Rasputin:
WELL, GO ON!
WHAT IS IT, FATHER?
I HEARD YOU WENT
TO THE HOSPITAL
THE OTHER DAY.
YES, FATHER.
WHAT DID YOU
SEE THERE?
MOTHER AND I
TALKED TO A BOY.
THE FIRST DAY HE WAS
AT THE FRONT, HE LOST
BOTH HIS HANDS.
OH.
AND HE WAS SO BRAVE
AND BEAUTIFUL.
DO YOU LIKE
BEAUTIFUL BOYS?
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S PERFECTLY
NATURAL FOR A GIRL
TO THINK OF BOYS.
YOU MUST NEVER BE
ASHAMED OF LIFE,
MY DEAR.
NEVER.
I DON'T WANT TO BE
RUDE, FATHER,
BUT I HAVEN'T DONE
MY LESSONS,
SO IF YOU HAVE
ANYTHING TO TELL ME--
I'VE GOT SOMETHING
FOR YOU...
A LITTLE LOCKET...
[KISS]
A HOLY IMAGE
TO WEAR
AROUND YOUR NECK.
FATHER, I DON'T KNOW
IF I SHOULD.
AH, YOU SEE, YOU
ARE AFRAID OF ME.
NO, FATHER.
YES, YOU ARE,
AND YOU MUSTN'T BE.
YOUR MOTHER
WOULDN'T LIKE
THAT, WOULD SHE?
NO.
NO. WELL,
THEN YOU MUST BE
A LOT NICER TO ME.
NOW...
YOU PUT THIS
AROUND YOUR NECK...
AND EVERY DAY
YOU WEAR IT,
YOU'LL BE BLESSED.
WEAR IT
NEXT TO YOUR WARM
LITTLE HEART.
IT'S BEATING
SO FAST.
YOU KNOW...
IT REMINDS ME
OF A LITTLE BIRD
I ONCE HELD
IN MY HAND.
IT WAS SO AFRAID
I'D HURT IT,
BUT I DIDN'T.
THAT'S ALL I
WANTED TO SAY
TO YOU.
THANK YOU, FATHER.
MARIA, IT'S
YOUR BEDTIME.
Both: GOOD NIGHT,
FATHER.
GOOD NIGHT,
MY LITTLE DOVES.
[CREAK]
[CREAK]
AAH!
[WHIMPERING]
MARIA.
DARLING,
WHAT IS IT?
OH, NATASHA.
MY DARLING,
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
I DON'T KNOW.
I FELT AS IF
SOMEONE TOUCHED ME.
WHAT WAS IT?
NOTHING. IT WAS
JUST A BAD DREAM.
YOU LOOK
SO FRIGHTENED.
NO. YOU GO
TO SLEEP AGAIN.
CLOSE YOUR EYES.
I'LL BE HERE
IF YOU WANT ME.
GOOD NIGHT,
MY LAMB.
GOOD NIGHT, TASHA.
I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU.
GET OUT!
WHERE ARE YOU
GOING?
THE EMPRESS!
OPEN YOUR EYES!
NOW...CAN YOU HEAR ME?
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
YOU'RE SO FAR AWAY,
NATASHA.
YOU ARE SO FAR AWAY.
YOU'RE WHIRLING
UP IN THE SKY, NATASHA.
UP IN THE SKY!
AND THERE'S NOTHING
TO REMEMBER ANYMORE.
NOTHING TO REMEMBER.
LOOK, NATASHA.
LOOK!
THERE'S ONLY ONE STAR LEFT
IN ALL THAT BLACK SKY.
IT'S GETTING BIGGER
AND BIGGER.
IT'S GOING TO HIT US!
NOW IT'S GOING AWAY,
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS
OF MILES AWAY,
AND YOU'RE
FLOATING AFTER.
KEEP FOLLOWING IT, NATASHA.
KEEP FOLLOWING IT,
OR YOU'LL FLOAT FOREVER
IN THE COLD.
KEEP LOOKING, NATASHA.
I MUST LEAVE YOU NOW.
KEEP LOOKING,
OR YOU'LL BE LOST FOREVER
IN THE DARK.
KEEP LOOKING
AT THE STAR, NATASHA.
KEEP LOOKING.
KEEP LOOKING.
[DOOR OPENS]
[FLOOR CREAKS]
FATHER,
YOU FRIGHTENED ME.
I WAS, UH...
TALKING TO NATASHA,
AND SHE FELL ASLEEP.
WHAT IS THE CANDELABRA
DOING ON THE FLOOR?
OH.
UM, BACK IN SIBERIA
ON THE NIGHT OF
THE FEAST OF ST. JOHN,
WE USED TO LIGHT FIRES
IN THE FOREST
AND JUMP OVER THEM
SO THAT OUR PRAISES
WOULD RISE TO HEAVEN
ON WINGS OF FLAME.
I WAS SHOWING
NATASHA.
IF WE COULD ONLY
WORSHIP AS SIMPLY.
POOR CHILD. SHE'S
DONE 10 WOMEN'S WORK
IN THE HOSPITAL.
YES. DID THE CZAR
GET OFF ALL RIGHT?
YES. HE'S WORRIED.
AH. THAT'S WHAT'S
GOING TO SAVE
RUSSIA--THE CZAR.
ONE AUTHORITY.
ONE RESPONSIBILITY.
AND ONE BLAME.
BUT HE WON'T FAIL.
NO, NO.
OF COURSE HE WON'T.
WHY DON'T YOU
GET SOME SLEEP,
MY DAUGHTER?
YOU LOOK TIRED.
I AM TIRED,
FATHER.
GOOD NIGHT,
MY DAUGHTER.
I WOULDN'T
DISTURB HER.
BUT SHE CAN'T
STAY HERE.
I'LL WATCH HER.
IT'S DANGEROUS TO AWAKEN
ANYONE BY CANDLELIGHT.
HER EYES ARE OPEN.
SHE'S RIGID!
IT'S JUST
A DEEP SLEEP,
THAT'S ALL.
SOMETHING'S THE MATTER.
NO, NO.
NOTHING THE MATTER.
NOTHING THE MATTER.
GOING TO THE EMPRESS.
ARE YOU DREAMING,
MY CHILD?
I'M GOING TO THE--
Alexandra: I'M HERE.
MAJESTY!
NATASHA,
MY CHILD.
WHAT'S
THE MATTER?
HE...
HE WAS GOING
INTO MARIA'S ROOM.
WHAT?
I FOUND HIM.
NATASHA!
HE WENT TO MARIA'S ROOM.
I SAW HIM!
THAT'S A LIE.
NATASHA HAS
NEVER LIED.
MAJESTY, ON MY HONOR.
I'LL KILL HIM! I WILL!
NATASHA!
WELL?
FORGIVE ME.
ONCE I SAW YOU
WATCHING THE CZAR.
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.
ONE MOMENT.
BEFORE YOU
CALL YOUR GUARDS,
LISTEN TO ME.
STAND ASIDE.
ALL RIGHT! CALL THEM.
I'D LIKE TO SEE YOUR FACE
THE FIRST TIME ONE OF
YOUR FAITHFUL PALACE GUARDS
DARES TO DISOBEY YOU.
THEN YOU'LL FIND OUT
WIY   PUT LUBOV
IN COMMAND,
WHY STURMER IS
MY FOREIGN MINISTER.
VALENKA AND VASSILIEV
AND BARON KRASSIN
AND ALL THE REST OF THEM
GOT THEIR POSTS
THROUGH ME.
SEND OFF A TELEGRAM
TO THE CZAR. HA!
HE WON'T GET IT.
TRY TO GO OUT YOURSELF
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
I'VE GOT RUSSIA
JUST WHERE I WANT HER.
DO YOU HEAR ME?
I AM THE CZAR
OF ALL THE RUSSIAS.
GET OUT OF HERE.
GLADLY.
MY FLAT
IS THE ROYAL PALACE,
AND IT HAS BEEN
FOR 6 MONTHS.
IF YOU WANT ANY
LITTLE FAVORS,
CALL ON ME.
GOOD NIGHT,
YOUR MAJESTY.
SLEEP WELL.
PAUL.
WE MUST FIND PAUL.
MARIA, LOOK!
OH, PAUL.
WHY, PAUL!
OH, I'M GLAD
TO SEE YOU.
WE ALL ARE.
THANK YOU, SIR.
WHERE'S NATASHA?
I'LL GET HER
FOR YOU.
WAIT, YOUR
HIGHNESS.
WE HAVE PLENTY
TO DO HERE.
NATASHA.
OH, I'M SORRY.
I'VE JUST FINISHED.
ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT NOW?
MAY I TAKE HER
AWAY FROM YOU
A MINUTE, OLD MAN?
OH, NATASHA.
THERE'S NO ONE ELSE
IN THE WORLD HERE
BUT US.
WHEN YOU
SENT FOR ME,
I FELT AS IF
A COLD STONE
HAD BEEN ROLLED
FROM MY HEART.
MY BRAIN
STOPPED ACHING.
I COULD
BREATHE AGAIN.
I...
I DIDN'T
SEND FOR YOU.
THEY SAID YOU
WANTED TO SEE ME.
IT WAS THE EMPRESS.
OH.
NATASHA!
HOW LONG IS THIS THING
GOING ON BETWEEN US--
THIS THING
THAT'S TEARING
OUR HEARTS APART?
PLEASE DON'T, PAUL.
LISTEN, DEAR,
I'M GOING AWAY.
WHERE?
NOW, YOU SEE?
YOU DO LOVE ME.
LISTEN, DARLING,
THERE ARE LOTS
OF OTHER ARMIES.
I CAN STILL
BE FIGHTING
FOR RUSSIA,
AND WE'LL
BE TOGETHER.
NO.
YOU DID LOVE ME,
NATASHA.
DON'T YOU
LOVE ME ANYMORE?
I DO, PAUL.
THEN COME WITH ME.
NO.
IS IT SOMETHING
I'VE DONE?
NO.
PLEASE DON'T
ASK ME ANYMORE.
THEN WHAT IS IT?
I HAVE A RIGHT
TO KNOW.
YOU TOLD ME
WHAT HE WAS.
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.
I THOUGHT YOU
WERE PERSECUTING
A MAN OF GOD...
BUT I FOUND OUT.
GO BACK TO THE EMPRESS NOW.
SHE NEEDS YOU.
I MUST GO BACK.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
COME IN.
PAUL!
I NEVER WAS SO GLAD
TO SEE ANYONE.
MAJESTY.
SIT DOWN.
I NEED YOU.
YES, YOUR MAJESTY?
I'VE INJURED YOU,
BUT I'VE INJURED
RUSSIA MORE.
YOUR MAJESTY,
I KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU LOVE RUSSIA.
EVERYTHING
IN YOUR HEART,
EVERYTHING
THAT YOU'VE DONE--
YOU THOUGHT WAS
FOR RUSSIA'S GOOD.
MY HEART...
IS BROKEN.
WHAT ARE WE TO DO?
I THINK I KNOW...
PRECISELY
WHAT TO DO,
YOUR MAJESTY.
ALOYSHA.
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT ALOYSHA'S LIFE
IS THE PRICE
OF RUSSIA'S FREEDOM.
IF ALOYSHA DIES,
I DIE.
BUT RUSSIA MUST LIVE.
GOD BLESS YOU...
FOR YOUR COURAGE.
[MEN SINGING IN RUSSIAN]
[LAUGHTER]
HEY, BRING ME
THAT TOBOLSK CAKE!
BRING ME THAT CAKE.
I KNOW IT'S THEIRS,
BUT CAN'T I HAVE
THE CLOCK?
NO, NO, MY BABUSHKA.
DON'T BE SELFISH.
IF MARIA FOUND IT FIRST,
LET HER HAVE IT.
DID HE EAT
ANY MORE?
TWO, SIR.
TWO? THERE'S ENOUGH POISON
IN ONE OF THOSE CAKES
TO KILL 5 MEN.
THIS IS NERVE-RACKING.
ISN'T THE MAN HUMAN?
I CAN'T
UNDERSTAND IT!
ALL RIGHT.
GO BACK.
YES, SIR.
ISN'T ANYONE
DRINKING BUT ME?
HERE. GIVE IT
TO HIM.
NO, NO. PLEASE.
I'M AFRAID IT'S
BEYOND MY TALENTS.
BEYOND YOUR TALENTS?
YOU WANT TO GET
INTO MY GOVERNMENT,
DON'T YOU?
AND YOU STICK
AT A LITTLE BIT
OF CHAMPAGNE.
I WANT
MEN AROUND ME
WHO KNOW
HOW TO DRINK.
I'M GOING TO
MAKE IT A RULE.
HERE. I'LL SHOW YOU
THE WAY WE DO IT
IN TOBOLSK.
[SINGING STOPS]
[CHANTING]
THAT'S THE WAY
YOU SWILL IT DOWN.
IF YOU COULD DO THAT,
I'D MAKE YOU PRIME MINISTER.
I'LL TRY.
I'LL TELL YOU
A SECRET.
IF YOU
WANT TO DRINK,
KEEP ON EATING.
IT'LL SOP IT UP.
COME ON WITH THOSE
TOBOLSK CAKES!
HERE YOU ARE, SIR.
SIR?
"EXCELLENCY," YOU
WHITE-BELLIED PIG.
YES, YOUR
EXCELLENCY.
THAT'S BETTER.
SHOULD HAVE
SOME OF THEM.
THE CHOCOLATE-COATED
ONES ARE THE BEST.
THANKS. I THINK I'D
PREFER ONE OF THESE.
[HIGH VOICE, MOCKING]
YOU THINK YOU'D PREFER
ONE OF THESE.
YOU PREFER ANYTHING
TO THE THING I
TELL YOU TO DO.
I--
I'VE SEEN YOU BEFORE
SOMEWHERE.
WHERE HAVE I
SEEN YOU BEFORE?
I DON'T KNOW,
YOUR EXCELLENCY.
I'VE WORKED
OTHER PLACES.
NO.
IT WAS HERE.
RIGHT HERE
IN THIS ROOM!
WHERE AM I?
GRISHKA.
GRISHKA.
WHERE AM I?!
I TOLD YOU. IN THE HOUSE
OF A FRIEND OF MINE.
A FRIEND?
CHEGODIEFF.
GUARDS! GUARDS!
GRISHKA!
THERE'S A TRICK HERE.
THERE'S A TRICK HERE!
THAT WAS
A FINE BUSINESS,
TRYING TO WHEEDLE ME
AND GET INTO
MY GOVERNMENT.
FIND HIM!
BUT WHO,
GRISHKA?
CHEGODIEFF,
YOU BLOCKHEADS!
HEY! HOLD HIM,
AND IF ANYTHING HAPPENS,
SHOOT THEM BOTH.
[GUESTS SCREAMING]
EVERYTHING'S
ALL RIGHT.
WE'VE
CAPTURED ALL
THE SERVANTS.
WHAT DO I CARE
ABOUT THE SERVANTS?
FIND CHEGODIEFF!
CHEGODIEFF!
FIND HIM.
GET HIS GUN!
Man: I'VE GOT IT.
Rasputin:
OHH. YOU, TOO, EH?
WELL, THIS IS VERY
INTERESTING.
WHERE HAVE YOU
BEEN HIDING YOURSELF
DURING OUR PARTY?
HIDING? I WAS
MERELY ATTENDING
TO MY HOSPITALITY.
I TRUST YOU'RE
GETTING SUFFICIENT
REFRESHMENT.
DON'T STOP PLAYING.
THERE'S NOTHING
THE MATTER.
THIS IS A VERY
CLEVER TRAP.
IT'S NO TRAP.
I MERELY WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU.
YOU'RE RATHER
A DIFFICULT MAN
TO SEE.
YOU'LL FIND ME
MORE DIFFICULT TO SEE
THAN EVER IN A MINUTE.
GIVE ME THAT GUN!
[SHOUTING]
DON'T DO THAT!
I'M GOING TO BLOW A HOLE
THROUGH HIM!
I OUGHT TO HAVE DONE IT
LONG AGO.
GRISHKA! THERE
ARE 50 PEOPLE
IN THIS ROOM.
GET LUBOV!
HE CAN
TALK TO HIM.
GRISHKA,
LET LOOSE OF IT.
AAH!
HE WANTED A KILLING.
I'M NOT GOING TO
DISAPPOINT HIM.
COME ON, GRISHKA.
GIVE HIM THE GUN.
RASPUTIN,
A SCANDAL
LIKE THIS
WOULD RUIN YOU.
YES! IT WOULD
RUIN US ALL.
I'VE ALWAYS HATED
THAT ARROGANT SWINE!
GET HIM
OUT OF HERE!
LUBOV,
CAN'T YOU DO
SOMETHING?
GET OUT OF THE WAY!
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
WATCH!
NO, GRISHKA!
I'M YOUR VERY
BEST FRIEND.
LISTEN TO ME!
I'M GOING TO
KILL A DOG.
BUT I'M
THINKING OF YOU!
YES? AND I'M
THINKING OF MYSELF!
IT'S EITHER
THAT MAN OR ME.
OH, GRISHKA.
[WHISPERING]
HA! THAT'S
A GOOD IDEA.
THAT'S A FINE IDEA.
NOW LOOK HERE.
YOU ONCE TOLD ME NOT...
TO DISTURB THE LADIES
OF YOUR PARTY.
I THINK WE OWE THE SAME
CONSIDERATION HERE.
HOLD THOSE MEN HERE!
I'LL SEE THAT THEY GET A FAIR
AND IMPARTIAL TRIAL.
JUST ONE THING.
TONIGHT WAS ENTIRELY
MY IDEA.
Rasputin: AN EXCELLENT
IDEA IT WAS, TOO.
HA HA HA!
GO ON. LEAD ON.
GO ON THERE!
MORE MUSIC.
THE LOUDER THE BETTER.
[ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING]
WHAT ARE YOU
SMILING AT?
NOTHING.
YOU'RE NOT AFRAID
OF ANYTHING, ARE YOU?
OH, SIR! OH, SIR!
LET ME GO!
Rasputin: HOW WELL
DID YOU SEARCH HIM?
WE GOT EVERYTHING.
ANYONE DOWN THERE?
NO.
NOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
THAT LITTLE TALK YOU SPOKE OF.
MUST WE TALK
IN THE CELLAR?
THE CELLAR IS A PERFECTLY
GOOD PLACE...FOR A RAT.
HEE HEE HEE!
HEY! COME HERE.
THIS IS A PLEASURE
I PROMISED MYSELF.
AFTER YOU, PRINCE.
KEEP ON GOING.
HA HA HA!
THAT'S RIGHT.
OVER BY THE FIREPLACE.
YOU'RE GOING TO BE COALS
BEFORE LONG.
STILL SMILING, EH?
YES.
YOU'RE A LIAR.
YOU'RE SWEATING
UNDERNEATH THAT SMIRK.
[COUGHS]
WHY DON'T YOU ADMIT IT?
I MIGSHOOT YOU
IN THE HEAD,
AND THEN YOU'D
BE DEAD RIGHT AWAY.
OH. IS THIS GOING TO
TAKE A LONG WHILE?
YES, YOU
GRINNING SNOB.
I'M DELIGHTED.
YOU'RE DELIGHTED,
ARE YOU?
[MUFFLED]
YOU'RE DELIGHTED.
DELIGHTED.
[GUNSHOT]
THAT'S THE BEGINNING.
IT'S JUST A NIP.
I'M SAVING THE LAST ONE
TO PUT BETWEEN YOUR EYES.
WHY DON'T YOU
SMILE NOW, HMM?
HA HA! LIFE CAN BE
VERY SWEET.
OH, YOU DON'T
LIKE THAT, EH?
THAT ISN'T
SO FUNNY NOW, EH?
[MAN SINGING IN RUSSIAN]
AHH, THAT'S
A BEAUTIFUL SONG
TO DIE TO.
NIGHTS OF LOVE.
HA HA!
THERE'S DEATH
IN THERE, TOO.
LIFE AND DEATH
AND LOVE.
[LAUGHING]
WHAT ARE YOU
LAUGHING AT?
YOU. YOU'RE
FULL OF POISON,
YOU FOOL.
DON'T YOU
BELIEVE ME?
LOOK AT YOUR EYES.
THEY'RE LIKE
RED JELLY.
DIDN'T YOU EAT
TOO MANY CAKES,
HOLY FATHER?
AAH!
THEY WERE LOADED
WITH POISON,
AND NOW YOU
STUFFED THEM DOWN,
YOU SWINE.
IT'S THE SAME MUSIC.
LIFE AND LOVE
AND DEATH.
ARE YOU GETTING
COLD, HOLY FATHER?
IT'S THE FIRST SIGN!
HA HA! IT'S
TOO LATE FOR THAT.
LUBOV!
HE'S WITH HIS GIRL!
THAT'S WHERE
YOU'LL BE, HOLY FATHER.
YOU'LL BE WITH YOURS.
THE LITTLE CHILDREN
THAT BELIEVED IN YOU--
YOU'LL SEE THEM ALL NOW!
LIAR!
HEY THERE!
TELL THEM TO COME IN!
TELL THEM TO HURRY.
IT'S RASPUTIN!
HELP ME.
HELP! HELP!
Rasputin:
YOU CAN'T KILL ME!
YOU CAN'T! YOU CAN'T.
YOU CAN'T KILL ME.
YOU CAN'T KILL ME.
IF I DIE,
RUSSIA DIES.
DO YOU HEAR THAT?
SHE'D BE
DRAGGED DOWN...
DOWN TO
THE BOTTOMLESS PIT.
I TELL YOU THAT.
THE POISON'S WORKING.
YOU'RE TURNING BLUE,
FATHER.
AAH!
[RASPUTIN SCREAMING]
WHY DON'T YOU DIE?!
[PEOPLE BANGING ON DOOR]
Rasputin:
BABYLON HAS FALLEN.
FALLEN.
THE GREAT DAY
OF WRATH IS COME.
STOP IT!
THE CZAR ANOINTS HER.
ALL OF THEM WILL GO.
I SEE THEIR BODIES
DYING IN THE SNOW.
ANTICHRIST!
DROWN IN THE LAKE
OF HELL!
ANTICHRIST!
[MUSIC BOX PLAYING]
MAMUSHKA.
ALOYSHA.
Nikolai: COME IN.
THE ADJUTANT GENERAL ON DUTY
AND PRINCE CHEGODIEFF,
YOUR MAJESTY.
SEND THEM IN.
YOUR MAJESTY.
WAIT, GENERAL. I WANT YOU
TO SEE THAT THIS ORDER
PERTAINING
TO PRINCE CHEGODIEFF
IS PROPERLY EXECUTED.
THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION
FOR MURDER, PRINCE.
MY MINISTERS HAVE SUGGESTED
THAT YOU BE PUNISHED
WITH DEATH,
BUT I CANNOT TAKE A LIFE
THAT HAS BEEN SO DEVOTED
IN THE PAST TO MY SERVICE.
I HAVE THEREFORE ORDERED
THAT YOUR PUNISHMENT
BE EXILE.
WHO ELSE IS
IMPLICATED IN THIS?
NO ONE,
YOUR MAJESTY.
LEAVE US, GENERAL.
PAUL.
PAUL, THIS IS
HOW WE REWARD
YOUR DEVOTION.
IT HAD TO BE DONE, PAUL,
OR PRECIPITATE A CRISIS.
ALL OF RASPUTIN'S
CREATURES ARE
STILL IN POWER.
I KNOW, SIR.
I'M RETURNING
TO THE FRONT
TO REMOVE VALENKA.
KRASSIN WILL GO NEXT,
AND ALL THE REST WHEN
I KNOW WHO THEY ARE.
BUT A COUNTRY AT WAR
WILL HAVE TO GO SLOWLY.
I WISH I COULD HELP YOU,
YOUR MAJESTY.
YOU'LL SERVE YOUR COUNTRY
MORE BY LEAVING.
WHEN I'VE
CLEARED THEM ALL OUT,
I'LL SEND FOR YOU.
AS SOON
AS YOU CAN, SIR.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
PAUL, WHERE
WILL YOU GO?
TO ENGLAND. I'VE BEEN
OFFERED A COMMISSION
IN THE LINE.
HOW'S THAT, LIEUTENANT?
PAUL, TAKE NATASHA
WITH YOU.
DO AS YOU'RE TOLD.
SHE DESERVES
TO BE HAPPY.
OH, YOUR MAJESTY.
TAKE CARE
OF HER, PAUL.
I SHALL, SIR.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
YES?
COMPLIMENTS
OF GENERAL LAUDAI,
YOUR MAJESTY.
IF YOU WANT TO REACH
THE FRONT IN DAYLIGHT,
YOU'LL HAVE TO LEAVE NOW.
VERY WELL.
WE MUST LEAVE YOU HERE,
PAUL. AU REVOIR.
RUSSIA'S GOING TO NEED YOU
WHEN THIS IS OVER.
THIS TIME, ALL OUR PLANS
ARE GOING THROUGH.
I HOPE SO, SIR.
Paul: YOUR MAJESTY!
YOUR MAJESTY.
I--I NEVER BELIEVED
THAT MADMAN BEFORE,
BUT ONE THING
HE SAID IS ROARING
IN MY BRAIN.
HE SAID
WHEN HE DIED,
RUSSIA DIED.
I'M AFRAID
THE CANCER'S BEEN
REMOVED TOO LATE.
WE'RE ALREADY
DESTROYED.
NO, PAUL. RUSSIA IS
TOO GREAT TO BE DESTROYED
BY ANY ONE MAN.
PAUL, HERE IS RUSSIA.
AND HERE.
AT LEAST
WOULDN'T IT BE WISE
TO SEND
HER MAJESTY OUT
WITH THE CHILDREN
UNTIL THE STORM
BLOWS OVER?
WE HAVE NEVER INJURED
OUR PEOPLE, PAUL.
THEY WILL NEVER
INJURE US.
[GUNFIRE]
[LAUGHTER]
GET OUT OF MY WAY!
OH, HOW DO YOU DO,
COMRADE GENERAL?
DO THEY KNOW WHERE
WE'RE TAKING THEM?
SHE DOES.
WHAT MAKES YOU
THINK SO?
SHE ASKED ME
TO TELL THE CZAR
THAT WE WERE
TAKING HIM TO MOSCOW
FOR HIS SAFETY.
HA HA HA!
HE'LL BE SAFE, ALL RIGHT,
BUT NOT THE WAY HE THINKS.
ATTENTION!
Nikolai:
HE RESTORETH MY SOUL.
HE LEADETH ME
IN THE PATHS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS
FOR HIS NAME'S SAKE.
YEA, THOUGH I WALK
THROUGH THE VALLEY
OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH,
I WILL FEAR NO EVIL,
FOR THOU ART WITH ME.
THY ROD AND THY STAFF,
THEY COMFORT ME.
THOU PREPAREST
A TABLE BEFORE ME
IN THE PRESENCE
OF MINE ENEMIES.
THOU ANOINTEST
MY HEAD WITH OIL.
MY CUP RUNNETH OVER.
SURELY GOODNESS AND MERCY
SHALL FOLLOW ME
ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE,
AND I WILL DWELL IN THE HOUSE
OF THE LORD FOREVER.
AMEN.
AMEN.       AMEN.
WE ARE READY.
IS THAT
EVERYTHING
YOU'RE TAKING
WITH YOU?
WE HAVE EVERYTHING
WE NEED AT MOSCOW.
YOU'LL WANT
MORE THAN--
THAT'S RIGHT.
WELL, LET'S
GET STARTED,
COMRADE.
YES.
WHAT'S THAT? GOLD?
MAY I HAVE IT?
YOU SEE, IT'S
MY LAST ANNIVERSARY
PRESENT.
OUR 23rd.
MY ORDERS ARE
THAT NOTHING VALUABLE
LEAVE THE PALACE.
THE PICTURE'S
ALL WE WANT.
WE HAVE BEEN
HAPPY, NICKY.
YES. WE SHALL
ALWAYS HAVE THAT
TO REMEMBER.
THERE'S VERY LITTLE
TIME FOR THAT,
COMRADE.
READY, CHILDREN?
Children:
YES, MAMUSHKA.
WE'RE READY, TOO.
OH, DEAR, DON'T YOU
THINK WE'D BETTER
LEAVE HIM HERE?
WHY, MAMUSHKA?
HE MIGHT GET COLD
ON THE WAY.
AND WE CAN ALWAYS
SEND FOR HIM,
CAN'T WE?
YES. YES.
COME ON, PLEASE.
AT ONCE. MARIA?
WHATEVER YOU SAY,
MAMUSHKA.
I SAW YOU
FEEDING HIM ONCE.
I'LL TAKE
GOOD CARE OF HIM.
COME, MY BROOD.
YOU'VE DRESSED
WARMLY, CHILDREN?
WHAT'S THAT?
ALL THE REFORMS EVER
PROPOSED FOR RUSSIA
IN THE LAST 10 YEARS.
SOME OF THEM
ARE BAD.
SOME OF THEM
ARE EXCELLENT.
EVEN YOUR
REVOLUTIONARY IDEAS
ARE THERE.
WELL, WHAT DO I WANT
WITH THEM?
I WAS THINKING THAT
IF YOU COULD GET THEM
TO SOME OF THE PEOPLE
OF THE GOVERNMENT,
TSINCERE PEOPLE--
THERE MUST BE
MANY OF THEM--
IT WOULD SAVE THEM
TRAGIC MISTAKES.
ALL THE NEEDS
OF RUSSIA
ARE SO CLEARLY
OUTLINED THERE.
THEY MIGHT
FIND A BRIDGE
BETWEEN REVOLUTION
AND THE KIND
OF GOVERNMENT
THEY'RE AFTER.
I THINK WE CAN GET ALONG
WITHOUT ANY SUGGESTIONS
FROM YOU.
YOU WILL, YES.
I WAS THINKING
OF RUSSIA.
[MEOW]
[RAUCOUS LAUGHTER]
SHUT UP!
[LAUGHTER STOPS]
[TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS]
[GUNS COCKING]
[GUNS FIRING]
[SINGING IN RUSSIAN]
Who are you?
I was King of Sweden.
The Lord, in his infinite wisdom... has seen fit to deprive us of our noble king...
Gustavus Adolphus... while Sweden is in the midst of a grievous war.
For 14 years our arms have served in the field... against our enemies.
And in this dark hour, we still fight on... for the Protestant cause of our country.
Our King is dead... but his spirit still lives in us... and in his child, Christina.
Her father, our King... brought up this child as a boy... accustomed her ears to the sound of cannon fire... and sought to mold her spirit after his own.
Let's see the child.
Your Majesty...
I swore to the King, your father, to place this crown upon your head.
And now I swear by my life... to serve you as I served him.
Men do not cry.
Shall I make my speech now?
Good Lords, and Swedish men...
Queen Christina, by the grace of God...
Queen of the Swedes, the Goths, and the Vandals, promise you... to be a good and just king... to protect you all... and to guard the kingdom as our father did... to rule wisely, and with God's help... to keep the standard as we received it from our fathers.
Concerning this war, which we are bitterly waging... we promise...
To wage it with courage.
We promise to win it!
I bless you all.
The King is dead, long live the King.
Long live the King!
Your Majesty.
The arrival of Prince Charles forced me to summon Your Majesty.
The Parliament is in session, waiting to act on his victories.
After 30 years of war, Sweden now has the commanding place in Europe.
Now is the time for new, definite actions.
These I want to discuss with you.
There will be enough discussion in the Parliament.
You have reports for me to sign, my Lord Treasurer?
I have them here, Your Majesty.
Prince Charles' victory was crushing, was it not, Chancellor?
Complete, Your Majesty.
Now would be a happy moment... to announce your betrothal to Prince Charles.
He returns a national hero.
I look forward to Prince Charles' reception in the Parliament.
He will love it.
I have heard of the enemy's losses.
What were ours?
10,000 men, 4,000 horses, 200 cannon.
A few more victories like this... and we will have to hire foreigners to fight our battles.
In the end, the enemy will pay for it.
In the meantime, it would be a good moment to vote fresh monies for the war.
The Lord Treasurer will tell Your Majesty we need it.
He doesn't have to tell me.
These reports tell me.
This war is expensive.
The Parliament clamors for more war.
They clamor for a Swedish marriage for Your Majesty.
They clamor for an heir of Swedish blood.
In short, Chancellor, they clamor.
Here are your reports. This one I keep.
Thank you, My Lords.
I shall see you in the Parliament.
Your Majesty.
Yes, Count Magnus.
It's so long since I have seen you.
- I saw you yesterday.
- To me that's long since.
I am not an idle woman, Magnus.
I have a war on my hands.
Are you going to marry the national hero?
You are petulant, Magnus, and I have no time to soothe you.
The Parliament is waiting.
We are eager to greet our victorious cousin...
Prince Palatine Charles Gustavus.
Welcome, my cousin.
For the great victory you have won,
Sweden is grateful.
We will not forget.
For the fatherland, Your Majesty, and loyalty to you... and for glory, no sacrifice is too great!
Our enemy is in retreat and our standards fly over the fields of their dead.
Now, Your Majesty, would be a good time to send fresh armies... and crush these barbarians.
We want to continue what we began in your father's reign... until every enemy soldier is disarmed!
This is not an ordinary war for treasure or conquest.
It is for our faith and for our God.
God is being invoked in many lands these days, Your Grace.
What about the enemy's God?
When the enemy invokes God, that is blasphemy, Your Majesty.
I wish I had your confidence, Archbishop.
We of the nobility are willing to back our noble commander Prince Charles... to the last man!
I thank the noble Lord.
For your glory, Your Majesty,
I return to the wars with fresh courage.
You have all spoken:
You, my Nobles... you, my gallant General... you, my Archbishop... and you, my hero cousin.
I have heard all your voices.
But what of the peasants?
You peasants have fought this war.
What have you to say?
Will you not speak, father?
What is there for us to say, Your Majesty?
Unbeknownst to us, the war is started and we are sent, and we go.
You shall go no longer!
There are other things to live for than wars!
I have had enough of them.
We have been fighting since I was in the cradle and many years before.
It is enough.
I shall ask the powers to meet for a speedy and honorable peace.
There must be an end!
What? Peace now? After such a victory?
We have these heretics by the throat.
Let us have them on their knees.
Will you slaughter all of contrary faith,
Archbishop?
You are too ambitious.
But, Your Majesty, if the enemy refuses to accept our terms?
Offer them terms they will accept.
Your father, the King, must be avenged!
Not avenged, My Lord, justified!
He must be justified!
We must have compensation for our soldiers.
20 million thalers!
30 million!
I will take their last thaler!
The world rings with the fame of our armies!
And we shall win still greater glories for Sweden.
Spoils! Glory!
Flags and trumpets!
What is behind these high-sounding words?
Death and destruction!
Triumphals of crippled men!
Sweden victorious in a ravaged Europe.
An island in a dead sea!
I tell you, I want no more of it.
I want for my people security and happiness.
I want to cultivate the arts of peace.
The arts of life!
I want peace, and peace I will have.
Your Majesty.
Every morning I come to wake you... and every morning
I find you already awake and reading.
It's not right, Your Majesty, to rob your sleep.
I have so little free time, Aage, that to spend it sleeping seems a waste.
What a clever fellow is this, Aage.
- Who?
- Molière.
- What is he?
- He writes plays.
He makes fun here of pretentious ladies.
"As for me, Uncle, all I can say is that I think...
"marriage an altogether shocking thing.
"How is it possible to endure the idea of sleeping...
"with a man in the room?"
Is that good, Your Majesty?
Not bad, Aage.
They say... you are going to marry Prince Charles.
Do they? What do you think of it?
I think it's good for a queen to marry a hero.
What else do they say?
They say... you prefer the Lord Treasurer.
And what do you think of him?
I don't like him, Your Majesty.
- Why not?
- The right foot.
He's too clever.
Everybody can't be simple and heroic, Aage.
Well...
I don't like him!
Ebba, come in.
Now don't dally, Your Majesty.
You have a busy day.
Morning, Ebba.
- What are you doing up so early?
- I couldn't sleep.
That means you are happy or unhappy.
Which is it?
- Happy.
- I am glad.
- And what makes you so happy?
- No reason.
How wonderful to be happy for no reason.
Let's go for a sleigh ride.
- I can't now.
- Why not?
- Ambassadors, treaties, councils.
- How boring.
- But we'll go afterward, Ebba.
- You always say that.
But at the end of the day, you are never free to go anywhere.
You are surrounded by musty old papers and musty old men... and I can't get near you.
Today, I will dispose of them by sundown,
I promise you.
And we will go away, two or three days in the country.
- Wouldn't you like that?
- I'd love it.
The French Ambassador, Monsieur Chanut, is waiting in the council chamber.
There, they begin.
Countess, you're dismissed. Run along.
I have good news for you,
Monsieur Chanut.
Your countryman, the philosopher
Descartes, is coming here.
What happier destiny for a Frenchman than to come to you, Madame.
You are the only Ambassador,
Monsieur Chanut... who doesn't treat me like an institution.
I must confess, it's very agreeable.
That is charming of you, Madame.
But the arrival of the Spanish Ambassador makes it especially urgent... that you sign the treaty with France now.
Do not fear, Monsieur Chanut.
The Spaniard's arrival cannot disturb the natural harmony... between Sweden and France.
But the strained relations, Madame, between my government and Spain...
They can never affect ours,
Monsieur Chanut.
Madame, you are my despair.
Why?
Because you rebuff me always with such charm... that at the end of all our interviews
I find myself always in a veritable glow... of disappointment.
And I, of anticipation.
Your Majesty, our university at Uppsala is the oldest in Sweden... one of the oldest in Europe.
To admit professors from Spain and Italy might corrupt the purity of our teaching.
The danger is not so much of corruption as of staleness.
We need new wine in the old bottles.
Here is the new draft of the treaty with Cromwell, Your Majesty.
There are several important changes in it, so if you read it, please... that I may know your opinion.
I will do so, Chancellor.
Your Majesty, I must again speak to you about your marriage with Prince Charles.
This eternal talk about Charles.
I cannot tell you how it wearies me.
I do not see eye to eye with Charles about anything.
- He is a hero.
- There are varieties of heroes.
He is a hero at fighting, and fighting bores me.
- His only gift is with the sword.
- The sword has made Sweden great.
Yes, but do we not exalt that gift too much, Chancellor?
You cannot remake the world,
Your Majesty.
Why not?
Look, Chancellor, the philosophers remake it, the artists remake it... the scientists remake it.
Why not we who wield the power?
The people follow blindly the generals who lead them to destruction.
Will they not follow us who lead them beyond themselves... where there is grace and beauty, gaiety and freedom?
Europe is an armed camp, Your Majesty, not Utopia peopled with shepherds.
But Chancellor...
Snow again. Eternal snow.
Your Majesty, it is for Sweden.
It is your duty.
Why is it my duty?
My days and nights are given up to the service of the state.
I am so cramped with duty that to be able to read a book...
I have to rise in the middle of the night.
I serve the people with all my thoughts, with all my energy... with all my dreams, waking and sleeping.
I do not wish to marry, and they cannot force me.
You must give Sweden an heir.
Not by Charles, Chancellor.
You are Sweden's Queen.
You are your father's daughter.
Must we live for the dead?
For the great dead?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Snow is like a wide sea.
One could go out and be lost in it... and forget the world and oneself.
There are rumors that Your Majesty is planning a foreign marriage.
They are baseless.
But, Your Majesty, you cannot die an old maid.
I have no intention to, Chancellor.
I shall die a bachelor.
Of course, Magnus, you heard everything.
No wonder you are so well-informed.
I am rather disappointed you are not going to marry Charles.
I'd much rather him than another.
Charles spends all his time reviewing troops.
It doesn't become you to make fun of Charles.
He has risked his life for his country.
He, at least, is no opportunist.
You're serious today.
- It isn't that, Magnus.
- No? What then?
I look at you and I look at a stranger.
A stranger whom I do not altogether like.
I grant you your preferences, if you will love me.
Love you?
I wonder now, Magnus, if I have ever loved you.
I am your destiny, Christina.
Are you?
- I long to escape my destiny.
- You will long to return to it.
- Where is Countess Ebba?
- In her chamber, Your Majesty.
The Queen is selfish. It is simple for her.
She orders and you obey.
How long are you going on this way?
Every time we meet, you promise to tell her... you love me and you want to marry me and you never do.
The Queen is so dominating.
She's interested only in her own concerns.
She never asks me.
Your Majesty.
Leave us.
- Forgive me. Forgive him.
- It is you I cannot forgive, Ebba.
You needn't fear my domination any longer.
Your Majesty, please.
You pretended to be interested in me and my problems.
Your sympathy, your concern... all pretense, underneath which you resent me.
You do not understand, Your Majesty.
The difficulty is, Ebba, that I do.
Your Majesty.
What now?
I must warn you about the impending visit of the Spanish envoy.
Sweden is the great Protestant stronghold of Europe.
Therefore, with this Spaniard, you must be polite but reserved.
Very well.
What is this?
The people know that Prince Charles is visiting you here.
They are excited about it.
They want to see their Queen.
Must I smile for the masses, Chancellor?
That is not too much to do for the people.
We want Prince Charles as our King!
Christina, our Queen!
Long live Charles Gustavus!
Long live Prince Charles!
- Sweden for the Swedes!
- Prince Charles for our King!
This is what comes, Chancellor, from feeding the people a false hope.
- Aage.
- Your Majesty?
My riding coat. We go out in the snow.
- To hunt, Your Majesty?
- At least not be hunted.
Foreigners.
Spaniards.
You find this amusing, do you?
Where is that fool of a coachman?
It's not his fault.
The ditch is full of soft snow.
- It often happens like that here.
- What a country.
Aage, get the robe, put it under the wheel.
Tell the coachman to take off his robe and put it under the other wheel.
Now, all together, with a big heave.
Aage, hold the horses.
Now all together, push!
That's splendid.
How far is it to the nearest inn?
Two leagues.
You can be there by nightfall.
That is, unless you fall into another ditch.
Give the boy a thaler, Pedro.
Where is the landlord?
- There he is.
- Coming.
What can I do for you, young man?
Supper, room and bed.
I have only one room vacant.
That's the best one.
That's for people of quality, costs three thaler.
Give him 10, Aage.
Thank you, My Lord.
This way, Your Lordship.
Right up to the head of the stairs.
The best room in the house, it is, too,
My Lord.
Right here, My Lord.
I hope this place serves your purpose,
My Lord.
Looks adequate but Ionesome.
That is soon remedied... a fine young man like Your Lordship.
It is a cold night to be alone, that's certain.
I can find Your Lordship some good company if you are in the mood.
- A thorough host, aren't you?
- Thank you, My Lord.
Fascinating profession, to run an inn.
- You sit still and the world comes to you.
- Yes, My Lord.
Will you sup here?
I'll have a fire for you presently.
- I will sup below.
- Yes, My Lord.
We must have your best room.
My Lord is a great noble.
In fact, you may never again have a guest of his quality.
- You will be well-paid.
- You shall have 15 thalers.
- What does the gentleman want?
- Accommodation for the night.
Why, only now, this gentleman has taken our last room.
The best one.
Sir, I owe you an apology.
I crave your forgiveness for my mistake.
There is no need, sir.
I took pleasure in earning that thaler.
I keep it for good luck.
I am really mortified.
Of course, sir.
It was the fault of my old coat.
I hope that you will permit me a less superficial acquaintance with you.
Will you favor me with your company at supper?
Gladly.
- Lf I may be your host.
- No.
It must be my privilege to entertain you.
Besides, you come from a country that is close to my heart.
- You know Spain?
- Somewhat.
I shall like news of your countrymen.
- My countrymen?
- Yes, I shall like news of Velázquez.
Has he painted any new works recently?
What of Calderón?
He writes plays so quickly, there must be new ones.
When were you last in Spain?
I have never been there, only in my thoughts.
How wonderful.
You are a find indeed.
Landlord, come here.
This gentleman will sup with me.
Do your best, and bring something to drink at once.
Yes, right away, My Lord.
You don't know what this means to me.
Have you ever traveled?
Have you ever been far from home?
Have you ever been homesick?
I have never been out of Sweden.
Then you don't know what it is to be homesick.
You don't know what it means to feel that sense of loss.
The pain of nostalgia.
One can feel nostalgia for places one has never seen.
Yes, that's quite true.
Young man, that is the second time
I have underestimated you.
My Lords.
The foreigner, he promised 15 thalers for a bed.
When did I ever let slip 15 thalers?
To the kitchen!
Imagine, in this icecap, finding someone who knows Spain.
You understand I admire your country.
It's rugged and strong and impressive.
It has all the virile qualities.
And from all your northern fastness here, the Viking spirit has dominated Europe.
But what do the Vikings talk about in the evenings... when they come home from war and hunting?
Do they know the arts of living?
- You find us uncouth?
- Look at these people.
This is my lager.
I'll say this for them, they know how to enjoy themselves.
At home, our people are less hearty, but more graceful.
It's all a question of climate.
You can't serenade a woman in a snowstorm.
All the graces in the arts of love... the elaborate approaches that would make the game of love amusing... can only be practiced in those countries that quiver in the heat of the sun... in the still, languorous nights, where every breeze caresses with amour...
Iove, as we understand it, is a technique that must be developed in hot countries.
- Sounds glamorous and yet...
- What?
Somewhat mechanical.
Evidently you Spaniards make too much fuss about... a simple, elemental thing like love.
We Swedes are more direct.
But that's civilization.
Disguise the elemental with the glamorous.
A great love has to be nourished, has to be...
Great love?
Don't you believe in its possibility?
In its possibility, yes, but not in its existence.
A great love, perfect love, is an illusion.
It is the golden fable of which we all dream.
But in ordinary life, it does not happen.
In ordinary life, one must be content with less.
So young and yet so disillusioned.
Young man, you are cynical.
Not at all. Merely realistic.
Here you are, My Lords.
- Six!
- Nine!
- It's the truth.
- I say you are a liar.
I am in the Queen's army,
I know what I am talking about.
- Six!
- Nine!
Yonder are two gentlemen, we will ask them.
A tankard of ale that I am right, agreed?
Agreed!
- Six!
- Six is right.
Nine!
Sir, do you know the court in Stockholm?
Yes, I have been there.
Then you can settle our wager for us.
This drunken pig, who is my friend... maintains that the Queen, God bless her... has had six lovers this last year.
I claim that's a disloyal, libelous statement.
And what do you say?
I say there were nine. Six, indeed!
- Why, this is a very loyal fellow.
- Wait a minute.
I'd like to know first what the gentleman's opinion is worth.
Do you know anything about the matter?
Yes, I know something, but...
I am not at liberty to speak.
Not at liberty? I give you liberty!
- Let's have the truth!
- Yeah, the truth!
That it is six.
If you know anything, you know it's nine.
Gentlemen, this is unfair.
You can't bully him.
- You're a liar.
- Who's a liar?
Stop fighting.
I'll tell you the truth.
Gentlemen, I have the painful duty of telling you that you are both wrong... the sixes and the nines.
The truth is that the Queen has had 12 lovers this past year... a round dozen.
Long live the Queen!
Any lie will find believers as long as you tell it with force enough.
That was a gallant fight.
Tell me, is there any truth to all these rumors?
In Spain, we hear that the Queen is a bluestocking... who cares more for learning than for love.
What do they say of her in Rome,
I wonder?
In Constantinople, in Algeria?
Probably the farther from home, the nearer the truth.
I think you gentlemen are in good sympathy.
If I am not too bold,
I could suggest a way by which... this gentleman may be accommodated.
It would be very welcome.
Your room, sir, is the best in the house.
If Your Lordship would agree to share it...
I am loath to force myself upon you, sir, but I'll tell you of Toledo... and Cádiz, and the bullfights at Madrid, the dancing of Seville...
The bed, as you know, is large.
You might both lie on it and never know that you were not alone.
I feel that we have much to say to each other.
We've but broached the talk of men and countries, of love and manners.
It is true that I find talking to you very pleasant...
What do you say, sir?
I'm prepared to talk, I'm prepared to be quiet, whichever you prefer.
My sleeping manners are beyond reproach.
You would be doing a great service.
It's more I ask for than a bed for the night, it's a chance to talk of home.
I will give up my room for you, gladly.
Give up? I wouldn't hear of it.
The truth is... please forgive me, sir, but since I was a little child...
I've always disliked sharing my room with anyone.
You take the room and I'll go elsewhere.
I wouldn't hear of it, there isn't another free bed in the inn.
Well, I'll sit before the fire.
Am I so unpresentable?
Do my manners disgust you?
Does my speech bore you?
If you find me so unbearable, forgive me for having imposed myself on you.
- Good night, sir.
- Please, sir.
Say no more about it,
I shall sit before the fire all night.
No, you couldn't, I wouldn't...
- You shall share my room with me.
- Thank you very much, I'll be delighted.
If you are ever in Spain,
I'll return the hospitality.
Would Your Lordships like to retire now?
I think so, we are both tired.
Good night, Aage.
Pushing through these snowdrifts is not like... strolling under the orange trees at home.
It takes muscle.
I wish you both good night, My Lords.
I know you will be comfortable,
I've always had good reports on this room.
The room is well-behaved, is it?
I mean, My Lord,
I've never had any complaints.
Shall I help you off with your boots, sir?
No, thank you.
- What's your name?
- Elsa.
You're very pretty, Elsa.
Are you also good?
When I do not like a man, yes.
That's true virtue.
The basis of all morality in a sentence.
- Can I get you anything, sir?
- No, thank you.
The master says you are to have everything you need.
If you need anything, my room is at the end of the passage.
She prefers you.
You have the better chance.
I give her up gladly, if you are interested.
No, I am not.
Don't you think, since we are going to share the same bed... we should be introduced?
I am Don Antonio José Miguel de Prado,
Count Pimentel...
Knight of the Holy Roman Empire,
Envoy Extraordinary... from His Majesty Philip, King of Spain,
Aragon and Castile.
I am Count Dohna.
You must visit Spain.
I hope to.
You shall stay with me.
As a matter of fact, you may find our way of life very artificial.
We make a fine art of leisure.
Although we are ambitious as you are to dominate Europe... we are not so intense about it.
We like to...
We mix our ambitions with other things.
Which side do you sleep on, your right or your left?
I don't know, I never thought of it.
They say that a man should always sleep on his left side.
Keep his sword arm free.
It's hereditary. It's instinct.
Aren't you going to undress?
Yes.
Of course, it had to be.
I felt it.
A presence.
Life is so gloriously improbable.
My Lord?
- What is it?
- It is still snowing, My Lord.
Good.
They say we may not be able to move for three days.
At what hour will Your Lordship get up?
I shall not get up.
Very good, My Lord.
Will you take chocolate?
Yes, at once.
Will the other gentleman take chocolate?
Yes.
Very good, My Lord, two chocolates.
They warmed and ripened in the Spanish sun.
My hacienda is overrun with them.
In the season of the grape harvest... the air smells purple.
Purple grapes.
What are you doing?
I've been memorizing this room.
In the future... in my memory...
I shall live a great deal in this room.
You wait.
I'll show you the whole living world.
I have imagined happiness... but happiness you cannot imagine... happiness you must feel... joy you must feel.
And this great joy I feel now...
- Antonio?
- What?
This is how the Lord must have felt... when he first beheld a finished world... with all his creatures breathing, living.
And to think... a few snowdrifts might have separated us forever.
We might have been born in different centuries.
No, I never would have permitted that.
We're inevitable. Don't you feel it?
I feel it.
But you, how can you be so sure?
You know me so little.
That's true. There's a mystery in you.
Is there not in every human being?
Yes.
Tell me, you said you would... why did you come to this inn dressed as a man?
In my home, I'm very constrained.
Everything is arranged very formally.
A conventional household.
Very.
I like to get away from it sometimes... to be free.
I can understand that.
You're going to court.
What if the Queen keeps you there?
Let her try.
If half of the Queen's reputation is well-founded...
After you, she'll be tiresome!
To have found anyone in this wilderness would have been miracle enough.
But to have found you... this is too improbable.
I don't believe in you.
You're an illusion.
You'll vanish before my eyes.
Goodbye.
I shall live for our meeting.
I, too.
If you could travel with me to Stockholm...
Is it impossible?
Yes, I must go alone.
I loathe this separation.
As soon as I am quit of this court business, it won't be long.
We meet again, and then we do not separate.
You promise we'll meet again in Stockholm?
I promise.
What if I never see you again?
What if I curse myself for having let you go?
I promise you that we shall meet again.
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
Ebba.
Your Majesty sent for me.
How are you, Ebba? You look so pale.
Your Majesty, since I lost your favor,
I have not slept.
I was hurt by you, Ebba, and I lost my temper. Forgive me.
You shall marry Count Jacob.
You make me so happy, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty looks wonderful tonight.
The Spanish envoy will be dazzled.
The last one was a shriveled old man.
I hear this one's young and handsome.
Where did you hear that?
My maid met the Ambassador's valet.
And she said that he said that the Spanish envoy...
The Lord Treasurer attends Your Majesty.
Is all in waiting?
We have time enough.
I wouldn't like to keep the court waiting.
You kept them waiting for five days.
Where have you been?
The whole court has been in an uproar.
- Did you go to Sala?
- Perhaps.
You did not go there, we sent messengers.
- Then I am glad I did not go.
- Why did you leave?
- To get away.
- From me?
From all of you.
Why did you refuse to see me this afternoon?
Why? So many questions.
There would be fewer questions if there were more answers.
What's happened to you?
You've never looked so lovely as you do now.
His Excellency, Don Antonio de Prado,
Count Pimentel...
Knight of the Holy Roman Empire...
Envoy Extraordinary from His
Most Gracious Majesty, Philip IV...
King of Spain, Aragon and Castile.
Welcome, Your Excellency.
Your Majesty, I have come on a special...
Your Excellency will convey to the King of Spain... our high appreciation of the honor he does us... in sending to our court a person of your quality.
Your Excellency has the King's letter?
Your Majesty...
I have come on a special mission from His Majesty of Spain... on a matter of great public importance.
Will Your Majesty hear it now?
We will hear it presently, in private audience.
In the meantime, be assured of our warm consideration to your sovereign... and to you, his envoy.
I humbly thank Your Majesty.
We admire greatly the powers of your country.
Not only your skill in statecraft, but in the sciences and in the arts.
Your Majesty is most gracious.
The repute you have for learning is known to all Europe.
We look forward to our further meeting with you.
We would like news of your men of genius... of Velázquez and Calderón.
We will hear willingly of your cities...
Toledo and Cádiz...
Madrid and Seville.
My country could have no greater tribute than Your Majesty's curiosity.
In honoring your great men, we elevate ourselves.
The Lord Treasurer is waiting,
Your Majesty.
I can't see him.
He says it's very urgent.
- Tell him I don't want to see him.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Well, Countess?
The Queen can't see you, Your Excellency.
You mean she won't.
She won't, Your Excellency.
I trust you are well, My Lord.
I am beholden to Your Lordship.
I apologize for the rigors of our winter.
I believe the snow delayed you on your way here.
A few days. It was nothing.
I hope you found suitable shelter.
Our country inns are rough.
I did very well. Thank you, Your Lordship.
The climate here, My Lord, is fit only for those who are used to it.
It's not suited to foreigners.
I advise you to protect yourself against it.
You must be very careful.
Is this a threat, My Lord?
It's a warning.
A friendly warning.
The Queen will see Your Excellency.
Antonio.
Your Majesty.
You are angry.
I'm not angry.
I appreciate a jest. A royal jest.
However, the diversion being over... may I conclude my mission to your unusual country?
My master, the King of Spain, has commanded me to...
Must we talk about the King of Spain?
Antonio, I feel just the same.
I don't.
I feel unlucky being the thirteenth.
No, but I was lying terribly.
And now you don't love me anymore?
Don't despair, Your Majesty.
My master, the King of Spain, has the honor of asking your hand in marriage.
It isn't pleasant to have betrayed one's king... to have dishonored him in a far country.
Nevertheless, unworthy as I am, permit me to present...
His Majesty Phillip...
King of Spain, Aragon and Castile... your royal, humble suitor.
I meant no dishonor to him or to you.
Does he look like that?
I suppose he does.
I have quite a collection of royal portraits.
My suitors usually come in oil.
And I've kept them, because I love a good painting.
Why did you go out of your way to make me ridiculous?
All that idiotic talk of love and beauty.
It made my heart beat.
It made me dream like a fool and talk like one.
I thought you'd understand, when you saw me again, what had happened.
That it had been so enchanting to be a woman.
Not a queen, just a woman in a man's arms.
Yes, if you'd left my heart alone.
But I fell in love with you.
I love you, Antonio.
Look, the coin you gave me for helping you.
I've slept with it in my hand each night.
Forgive me for being a queen.
What do you want of me?
What do I want?
What?
I want back that room in the inn... the snow that fell... the warm fire and the sweet hours... beloved one.
Christina.
Just as you say, My Lord.
Go out into the streets.
Talk to your fellow citizens.
Explain it to them.
We will, Your Lordship.
This is for the good of Sweden.
Yes, My Lord.
You understand, then, our purpose?
And our motive?
Yes, Your Lordship.
We are happy to be of service to Sweden.
I tell you, Sweden is facing the greatest danger in her history.
Greater than war.
And it's a danger that hides in the highest councils of the nation... in the palace itself.
In the very chamber of the Queen.
Nay, I do not charge the queen with disloyalty.
But she is under a spell.
The spell of Spanish witchcraft.
The Spaniard is here with a proposal from Philip of Spain.
Why doesn't she send him away?
Do you want a Spanish sovereign?
No!
Do you want to give up the palace and faith... for which our fathers fought and died, to go to Rome?
No!
You're the most popular man in the kingdom.
You've only to appear in public and the mob starts shouting.
You're the only one who can demand of the Queen to send the Spaniard home.
You're the only one who can save Sweden from this calamity.
The Council awaits Her Majesty.
Her Majesty drives abroad with the Spaniard.
The business of the state may wait.
Whatever the Queen does,
Sweden will not suffer.
Send that Spaniard back home!
Send him away!
Down with the Spaniard!
Evidently, my people, who are said to love me... do not wish me to be happy.
Our Prince Charles, who has fought for us... is kept apart and scorned!
The Queen disports herself with a Spaniard!
I ask you, Swedes, will you tolerate this infamy?
No!
Then do something about it!
The Queen!
See? She rides openly with him!
Down with the Spaniard!
Come on!
And I charge you, Magnus... with having deliberately aroused the masses against the Queen.
No, the facts speak for themselves, Chancellor.
The Church will never permit such a marriage.
The Queen does not contemplate such a marriage.
Then why doesn't she send the Spaniard home?
I have been driving in the streets and I have seen disgraceful things.
How is it that we are not better policed?
In insulting our guests, they insult us.
Why is this not made clear to them?
The people resent this man, Your Majesty.
Not in his own person... but as interfering with our hopes of your marriage to Prince Charles.
You have fed them this hope... when you have known all the time that I have no wish to gratify it.
I hold you responsible. All of you.
Your Majesty is not considering to accept King Philip's offer?
No.
In that case, the presence here of the Spanish envoy is superfluous.
He could go home.
Why?
Do I peer into the lives of my subjects... and dictate to them whom they shall love?
Will I serve them less if I am happy?
What strangely foolish title is it that calls me ruler... if in what concerns me most nearly,
I'm to have no voice?
It is intolerable.
There is a freedom which is mine... and which the state cannot take away.
To the unreasonable tyranny of the mob... and to the malicious tyranny of palace intrigue...
I shall not submit.
Know this, all of you.
General?
Your Majesty, the crowd demands to see you.
They demand entrance to the palace.
Are you pleased, Count Magnus?
There's no cause for alarm.
I'm not alarmed, General.
The guards are ready and waiting.
Their guns are primed.
Shall I order them to fire?
No, General.
- Shall I arrest the ringleaders?
- No.
Then what shall I do, Your Majesty?
Let them in, General.
Your Majesty, you cannot do that.
But, Your Majesty...
Let them in.
- Let no one follow me.
- Your Majesty, you must not go alone.
I am not afraid of my subjects.
Dismiss the guards.
Right face. Forward march.
Open the doors.
Your Majesty...
Well, my subjects... is it a friendly visit?
Will not one of you speak?
No petition? No speech?
You come, then, just for a glimpse of me?
Send the Spaniard home!
You, my good man, come here.
What do you do?
I am a blacksmith, Your Majesty.
Are you a good blacksmith?
I should be.
My father was a blacksmith before me, and his father was before him.
What if I came to your smithy... and told you
I didn't like your blacksmithing?
You'd think it unreasonable, and rightly so.
My business is governing.
And I have the knack of it, as you have yours for your trade... by inheritance.
My father was a king, and his father before him.
My father died for Sweden, and I live for her.
Now, my good people... go home to your work... and leave me to mine.
My blessing on all of you.
Long live the Queen!
Too bad, Count Magnus.
Here comes that Spaniard all alone!
Kill the Spaniard!
Fortunate coincidence.
Can I be of help to Your Excellency?
You might call off your hirelings and let me proceed to the embassy.
I don't understand
Your Excellency's insinuations... but I can take no chances of complicating our splendid relations with Spain.
Therefore, I must insist on giving you my personal protection and escort.
A horse.
The protection offered a prisoner,
Your Excellency?
For your own safety.
You go to the embassy, Pedro.
You hate him.
You have incited this riot against him.
He is safe, Your Majesty, which but for my intervention... he might not have been.
I ask you to bring him here to me at once.
I should do so gladly, could I assume the risk.
Feeling is running high in the city.
There is only one safe course for Señor Antonio... that you sign the passport for his return.
You are a jealous upstart, Magnus.
You cannot endure that I love him.
If I am an upstart, Your Majesty...
I glory in it, for I owe my rise to your favors.
And to be jealous of Antonio is a high form of patriotism.
This is dangerous for you, Magnus.
Do you realize how dangerous?
Put me to death.
If I die, he dies.
My orders are in good hands.
It is inevitable, Your Majesty.
He or I.
Prepare the passport for the Spanish envoy.
My Lord Ambassador... this passport will assure your safe journey to the border.
Count de la Gardie... you are responsible for His Excellency's safety.
Permit me.
Your Excellency... you will tell your master we're deeply sensible of the honor he has done to me.
The ship Amaranta... awaits you at the harbor of Helsingborg.
I wish you... a safe journey, My Lord.
Can I be of service to Your Excellency?
I have no recourse against you here, My Lord.
I am an ambassador on foreign soil.
But if you could do me the courtesy to meet me on neutral ground...
That can be arranged, Your Excellency.
I shall provide convoy for you to the frontier.
Beyond the frontier,
I shall be at your service... to give you my personal escort.
Thank you, My Lord.
Your Excellency... from Her Majesty, the Queen.
Who's there?
It is I, Queen Christina.
I, Axel Oxenstierna.
What drives you here?
I could not go to sleep.
I, too, could not sleep.
I remember when you led me... a child, up the steps of this throne.
Your father and yourself... you two have been my life.
And if now you fail me, I fail.
That is too great a burden you put on me.
I have grown up in a great man's shadow.
All my life, I've been a symbol.
A symbol is eternal, changeless... an abstraction.
A human being is mortal and changeable... with desires and impulses... hopes and despairs.
I'm tired of being a symbol, Chancellor.
I long to be a human being.
This longing I cannot suppress.
And yet, you must.
You will.
His hand is upon you. The King's.
I have always listened to you with awe, Oxenstierna.
I respect no one in the kingdom as much as you.
Yet, something in me cries out that this cannot be true... that one must live for oneself.
After all, Chancellor... one's own life is all one has.
Yes, Your Majesty... that is all one has.
Therefore, you must give it up to your duty.
Greatness demands all.
Am I great, Chancellor?
I feel so little and helpless... and futile.
Yes, Your Majesty, when you are alone.
But tomorrow... when this great hall is filled with the pride of your realm... you will meet the occasion.
You will do your duty.
You will marry Prince Charles.
Duty.
My heritage, Your Majesty... and yours.
Her Majesty, the Queen.
My Lords... we are to hear from Her Majesty's own lips today... her decision on a matter... that is near to all our hearts.
Your Majesty...
I have served your family for three generations.
My course is almost run.
Today fulfills my work.
In your great wisdom, you have put aside all thought of a foreign alliance... however brilliant.
We are happy that the wishes of your people... are your wishes.
Only those of Swedish blood... should sit on the throne of Sweden.
The question of the succession has long been... the subject of my earnest consideration.
I am come here today... to tell you my decision.
There is among us one... who has served the state faithfully in war and peace... one who is also related to me by blood.
I speak of the Prince Palatine,
Charles Gustavus.
I believe I shall be in agreement with you... in saying that above all others... he is the man best fitted for the government of this kingdom.
The Prince has done me the honor of asking my hand in marriage.
The Prince has my answer.
I have given him the reasons why I cannot accept this offer.
In the absence of an heir of my blood... our constitution gives me the right to nominate for your approval... my successor.
I believe that no one would gratify your wishes better... than Prince Charles Gustavus.
I am resolved, therefore... here and now... to place in your hands... my abdication from the throne of Sweden.
Abdication?
No, Your Majesty, no!
Lord God, Madam.
What do you mean to do?
It troubles us to hear you speak... of forsaking those that love you as we do.
Can you be better than you are?
You're Queen of all these countries.
And if you leave this large kingdom, where will you find another?
Continue, good Madam, as long as you live.
And we'll do all we can to help you bear the burden.
Yes!
I am grateful for your loyalty.
But there is a voice... in our souls... which tells us what to do.
And we obey.
I have no choice.
Here are the emblems of power... which herewith, I present to you before God and mankind.
My Lord... will you take the crown from my head?
No, Your Majesty, I will not do it.
I swore to your father always to keep that crown upon your head.
I'll have no part in this.
And nor I think is there any here that will.
Colonel.
And now, farewell.
I thank Almighty God... who caused me to be born of a royal stock... and raised me to be a queen of so large and mighty a kingdom.
I thank, too, those nobles... who defended the state when I was a child.
And all of you... for the fidelity and attachment you've shown me.
Let me look at you once more.
And so, let me remember you... with love and loyalty... till memory is no more.
God bless you.
Farewell.
She'll be on the boat.
If the tide is full and the wind is with us, we'll sail.
- And she'll go with us?
- Yes.
- Where to?
- The islands of the moon.
Where's that?
A place I've never been.
I hope it's warmer there.
Enchanting.
- What's the population?
- Two.
But first, we have a little stop to make.
- Right across the border.
- To change horses.
To rid the world of an extremely annoying person.
- Count Magnus?
- Yes.
I'll leave Sweden a much more amiable country.
You wait here, Pedro.
Right over there, behind that clump of woods, Your Excellency.
At your pleasure, My Lord.
Goodbye, Sweden.
Aage.
Aage, where is the carriage?
Bad news, Your Majesty, there's been an accident.
The relief horses are lamed.
Impossible to get new ones till the morning.
Do we have to spend the night here?
Yes, Your Majesty.
It will do Your Majesty good to have a night's rest.
Rest.
Are you ready to sail?
Yes, Your Majesty, the boat is right here.
- Captain.
- Your Majesty.
I humbly greet you.
Antonio.
What has happened?
It was a duel, Your Majesty.
- Count Magnus?
- Yes.
Why do you stand here like this?
- Christina.
- Are you in pain?
No. Not now.
Have you said goodbye to your country?
Yes, to everything but you.
How sweet your eyes are.
You mustn't talk.
When the wind is with us, we sail.
Yes.
Spain.
My home is on a white cliff overlooking the sea.
- You'll never leave me, will you?
- No, never.
Your Majesty.
You must rest.
Rest.
Antonio?
Do you still want to sail, Your Majesty?
The house on the cliff.
Yes, Aage, we will sail.
I'll tell the Captain.
The tide is full and the wind is with us.
The wind is with us.
All hands on deck.
Let the gangway fall.

"THE PRINCE by Niccolo Machiavelli"
"In the century where treachery, cruelty, debauchery and violence... were the means of government and brute force was law...
Italy lived under the sign of the Borgias.
In 1492, a former soldier named Rodrigo Borgia... was elected pope under the name Alexander VI."
"During his youth, Borgia had several children:
Cesare Borgia, the perfect ferocious beast... without a single blemish of humanity."
Here she is, my lord.
What do you think of her?
Not much.
This is a surprise for him.
French wine.
Take it upstairs.
Now!
The child fears for her virtue.
She has good reason to.
Let go of me!
What an animal!
We need your help.
We've netted a pigeon.
Master Phillip's feathers.
What an idea, Carlo.
You're crazy!
Calm down. Don't get upset.
It can be taken care of without going against the other Signor Borgia.
That's different, but risky.
How much do you want?
I'll put it on your tab.
It's nice of you to join us for dinner.
Here you'll get everything you want.
Don't give her a hard time.
She'll soon be a friend of Cesare Borgia.
Come on, laugh, by the blood of Christ!
Watch out! Careful, sonny.
Oh yes, the Borgias, our masters... bandits who dishonored galley slaves.
Cesare, a poisoner who has insulted the name of the pope.
Let my friends go by!
They've insulted us!
You asked for it!
Beautiful.
"His brother Jean,
Duke of Gandia... favorite son of Alexander... was frivolous and refined... a supporter of the arts and more committed to beauty... than to his own glory."
Master, admire the Genoan brocade.
All the pope's kingdom will be buying from you.
I'll take it.
Let's ask for a painter's opinion.
Sire, these materials are quite extravagant.
I took a vow of poverty.
Listen to him!
It's so exalted.
- It's Sav...
- Savonarola, my lord.
You dare speak ill of our Holy Father?
Oh, sir, I forgot.
These samples...
I'll take them.
If you have more beautiful ones, show them to my sister Lucrezia.
Oh, to Lucrezia, to beautiful Lucrezia! How?
At this hour my sister is asleep, dreaming of life's gallant adventures.
Good, very good!
Is she still asleep?
No, she's waking up.
Open the curtains.
Did you have a good night?
Oh, very good.
Good morning.
- What's it like out?
- Beautiful and warm.
Did you sleep well?
Have sweet dreams?
Yes, but strange.
I dreamt that a young lord went to the Vatican... to ask my father for my hand.
When he arrived, he wasn't alone.
There were three of them.
Three husbands?
What an idea!
One would be enough for me, but he should arrive quickly!
That's my bucket!
Who's making all that noise on the terrace?
There's a match going on.
Come look.
- Hey, let's stop. It's too hot.
- You're right.
Already tired?
When you have such an attentive audience?
Come on. Make an effort!
This time they'll tear each other to pieces.
So it's we who are really the strongest.
Even though it is we who lean on their shoulders.
I pick the taller one.
He must be a knight.
They're fighting for a smile.
What asses!
How ugly he is.
All right. Come on, everyone!
Lucien, the milk bath.
Felina, the amaranth dress.
Let's hope Lucrezia's dress pleases her father.
But if it pleases him too much... he may have the whole court dress the same way!
What makes you so brash as to speak to me so frankly?
My knowledge of men, my lord.
Cesare Borgia can only dream of the power of the Papal State.
Really, Niccolo Machiavelli.
What prompts you to counsel me?
The certainty of having found the perfect model of a prince... who knows how to reign.
Go on.
Look.
These principalities, these duchies... all in the hands of your worst enemies.
You think I don't know that?
But I'm the youngest.
And the Borgias want to go on accepting the slander and insolence... while they forget the names of the Colonnas... the Orsinis, the Sforzas.
Never.
No one will be spared.
Look.
Who could believe that the pope's sovereignty... does not extend through Romagna?
Be patient.
With Romagna conquered... what would become of the small republic of Siena?
And later, of proud Florence?
And perhaps even... the kingdom of Naples?
All of Italy?
The challenge faced by the first Caesar.
Why should a second Caesar not carry on?
You are right,
Niccolo Machiavelli.
From now on, your fortune is linked to mine.
And my name to yours,
Cesare Borgia.
Give it to me.
Greetings, great Chief General of the Armies.
This is a surprise.
My brother coming to a council meeting.
No horses to train?
No poets to listen to, or clothes to try on?
Jean, Jean, you don't look well.
My father, Holy father.
Stay, Giovanni.
- His Holiness...
- I prefer "father."
So be it, Father.
Speak, I am listening.
Afterwards, it will be my turn.
I'm always pleased to hear my children speak.
News from Florence that the Dominican, Savonarola... continues to preach against us.
He reproaches me for dressing as a knight.
One must change one's appearance from time to time.
I have a plan against slander and rebellion.
Will you listen?
And I say to you, citizens of Florence... never in a Catholic state... have there been more frequent attacks.
Murder and rape have become so common... that no traveler is safe.
What is the reason for this?
The authority of Christ is under siege!
I have my father's signature.
An order that declares our enemies to be outlaws.
The Orsinis, the Colonnas, the Sforzas.
Have I followed your advice well?
I've been absolved beforehand.
There will be a few obstacles to overcome.
Or to suppress.
- Don't be afraid.
- I have confidence in you.
You have the trump card:
Your sister Lucrezia.
My God, you're right!
With her looks, an arranged marriage would be easy.
And what will you make of her?
A princess, a duchess?
The Queen of France!
To the ruin of the despised family, the Borgias!
Careful.
You're talking about the pope.
A pope who sacrifices the state to his children?
Let the Vatican live, but let the Borgias die!
We must eliminate Cesare, a murderer.
And his brother, that vain, debauched dandy!
And sweet Lucrezia.
At best, as worthy as her brothers.
It's not by force that we'll rid ourselves of those tyrants.
It's by scandal!
I'm afraid of nothing.
I propose that one of us... attempt to seduce the sister of the abominable Cesare.
That should be easy.
So, who'll take on the challenge?
Well, I will!
And tomorrow, I'll lay siege to the supposedly untouched citadel.
Yes, my dear, he went by twice looking up at the window.
Twice?
What does he look like?
He's tall, with a good build.
Going by two times.
It's a beginning.
Do you think he'll go further?
I wouldn't hesitate, if it were me.
I hope the heavens hear you!
Go with them, my dear.
Leave me alone.
- Is that an order?
- Yes.
You know I could call the guards.
Why? Am I in the harem of a great Turk?
You're in the home of a young woman on whom you've spied as she bathed.
Yes, you don't look like a stable boy.
Thank you.
But, really, I didn't see anything.
Who were you trying to get to?
One of my servants?
To Sensia?
To me?
It takes courage to run such risks.
It would mean death, wouldn't it?
There are other dangers.
You're warm.
A little, my lord.
Drink. Go ahead.
To my lord's health.
It's the right dose.
You'll bring this wine to His Eminence himself.
As if it came from one of his sharecroppers.
Leave now.
Giacobo.
There was no one like him for cleaning armor.
Oh, he was old.
Still working on your tapestry,
Penelope?
I was waiting for you, my lord.
- My beloved...
- Yes, I know.
Some hate me.
Some fear me.
And you... you love me.
Very surprising.
- I'm yours.
- Quite a gift.
But am I worthy?
That's the question.
All I know is that I love you.
To live here and see you from time to time.
Surprising.
- Here's the doctor.
- His Eminence, the Cardinal.
Oh, my lord. He has drunk a cursed wine. He is dying.
The cardinal liked good wine.
He didn't keep us waiting.
The first time... did you come to seduce me?
Yes. And now I myself am caught.
You are at my mercy.
And I can always call the guards and you'll be dead at my feet.
That's not what I'm afraid of.
No. You're only afraid that I'll refuse you.
Think what you like.
Why don't you marry me?
I'm a fine catch.
And you'd come with me to Pesaro?
We'll talk about that.
Am I to become a housekeeper and raise children?
No, no. I love you.
And I you.
Lucrezia, watch out!
There are men in the garden.
I recognized Cesare's insignia.
We've got to decide.
My dearest, if I'm assassinated...
No, don't be absurd.
A Sforza here?
My honor compromised?
Can you imagine the scandal?
What have you found?
A man with your sister.
A Sforza.
You have visitors without informing me?
Cesare Borgia, I love your sister and want to marry her.
Marry her?
How dare you? Dog!
Haven't you already married her?
You're crazy, Cesare! Do you take me for an innkeeper's servant?
I will be his wife. Do you hear?
And now, send your men away.
- What's the meaning of all this?
- The meaning?
The Sforzas, our enemies.
Exactly.
An alliance instead of hatred.
My diplomacy is better than yours.
- It's time you let me be a woman.
- Shut up!
Get rid of this pretty boy... and fast!
They'll have your hide for this!
It's all yours!
Hold it!
You mustn't yell so, Cesare... and make our lovely sister cry.
Sforza will make an agreeable brother-in-law.
Idiot! Get out of here, Jean.
This is my business.
No, Cesare, I'm the oldest... and the pope's lieutenant.
I'm giving the orders for once.
I don't want any discord here.
Do you understand?
Let Sforza swear that my sister is still untouched. If not!
Enough, Cesare!
What are you saying about young noblewomen?
You're not hurt, are you?
You must ask my father for my hand.
In private, he's an easy man... not intimidating at all.
"I, Alexander VI,
Sovereign Pope... bestow my papal blessing... upon the marriage... of Lucrezia da Croce... and Jean Sforza,
Count of Pesaro.
I, Alexander VI,
Sovereign Pope... name as rebels and outlaws...
Cardinals Orsini and Alviano and Prince Salviah.
Their castles and lands are to be destroyed."
Their earldoms of Terrasini... and the realm of Servia.
The King of France wishes proof of our friendship.
We will send him our son Cesare.
As a hostage, Father.
As an observer, my son.
And we have decided to continue the battle against our vassals.
I tell you, my brothers... that the voice of God inspires his noble servant.
The throne of St. Peter is occupied by a usurper!
The council is over.
Have I forgotten anything?
How can we fight against the worst rebels... if your son-in-law is named Sforza?
It's an obstacle to your control, at least at first glance.
My in-law is not very dangerous.
That's enough for today.
I'm tired.
And it's practically finished.
You'll model the face as you wish.
Yes, madam.
How beautiful it is!
It would be regrettable not to keep... an expression of this mortal body for posterity.
I want it at home.
To give it up...
Haven't you been paid well enough?
More than you dared hope?
The statue at home?
Giannino will recognize it!
He's not even aware of what treasures he has.
Sforza is in our way day after day.
We need an annulment, but what reason can we give?
There is no child.
Therefore, the marriage hasn't been consummated.
And that dog will be humiliated in front of all Italy.
What news?
Filippo, a young sculptor, just a whim.
Ayoung sculptor?
We'll stop his career right there.
Hunting again?
Even at night you leave us.
Our evening will be ruined, my lord.
Go ahead, Giannino.
We know what it means to be a hunter.
Go ahead.
I'll take your place.
Sir, we must hurry.
We've picked up a fresh trail and the wind is favorable.
Good-bye, Giannino.
Forgive me, Lucrezia.
Thank you, Matteo.
And make the hunt last until dawn.
Don't I know how to organize a party for my sister?
Thank you, Cesare.
And I think I've done well. Look.
I'm the one who chose the guests.
- They're all courtesans.
- Did you desire monks and nuns?
Oh, no! No formalities.
Let everyone dance and drink... and, above all, enjoy themselves.
Of course. An annulment.
Giannino will never agree.
We'll persuade him.
Enough discussion.
You have no idea where you are?
No. I followed some friends.
- I don't regret it.
- But who are you?
Donato. I've come from Ferrara to fall in love.
Your name?
Lucrezia Borgia.
She can't be as beautiful as you.
But your name isn't important.
Yes, it is. We must be discreet.
- Don't be afraid.
- Afraid? I'm only thinking of you.
Don't ever speak about this evening.
Not to anyone, ever.
You're so young.
- So very young.
- If you only knew...
Haven't you talked enough?
Your brother has put aside his fraternal feelings... for he realizes...
That Sforza is in the way.
He must accept an annulment.
If not...
Mix up politics in conjugal matters?
Don't count on me, Cesare.
And if Giannino refuses?
For the good of the state,
Lucrezia must be set free.
I'm not so sure.
Good-bye. I have two Arabian horses to try out.
What an idiot!
Your brother has left?
Forgive me, Cesare.
Get out of here, and fast!
Darling! You're hurt!
You're always right.
Because I'm the only one who's not afraid of you.
It's true.
Everyone is afraid of Cesare.
No one knows him.
Lovely invention.
Get me to sign a confession of impotence?
I'll have an heir, God willing, when I want one.
I love Lucrezia and I'm keeping her.
We can't force you, my lord... but me must follow this up.
Come in.
Mario, see that my husband's best horse is saddled up immediately.
Am I to understand, madam...
No. You are to understand nothing.
Go ahead.
That young man is delightful.
May I have him as a valet?
You may not.
Here's Sforza.
Careful, little sister.
Be dramatic.
- Greetings, brother.
- Your best horse is saddled.
- You must flee.
- What?
Don't you understand?
They want to separate us.
Any way they can.
Would they murder me?
Go back to Pesaro.
You'll be safe there.
Forgive me, darling...
And must I leave immediately?
Run your horse into the ground, if necessary.
Let's not lose our heads.
- Lucrezia, come with me.
- That's impossible!
- They want to separate you!
- That's true.
No, Giannino. I'll join you later.
Go, I beg you.
You're right. I'll get ready.
- He's going to leave?
- You're finally free!
- You're a fine brother!
- Anything for such a lovely sister.
Thank you.
No, Giannino.
Don't lose any time.
Our house is so kind to guests.
You certainly have imagination.
Do you think so, Lucrezia?
With Cesare, the threat was very realistic.
Very.
Look!
The bird had flown away.
Only Lucrezia and the duke remained.
My brother is the one who warned that dog?
Certainly.
The Borgia family is very united.
Too true.
And there are too many of them.
Another body has been pulled out of the Tiber.
It happens all the time.
He must say what he saw.
Two more turns.
Talk!
The pincers.
Stop!
I swear I'll tell everything.
- Tell what?
- I lied.
Last night
I was setting my nets.
I saw the murderers.
I saw... I swear I'll tell all.
Your Holiness.
What is it?
- Your Holiness.
- What news do you bring?
Speak!
My friends, the Duke of Gandia has just been assassinated!
Send in the witnesses... quickly!
Why?
Holy Father.
Speak.
You'll have more gold... than you ever dreamed.
Speak... or you'll be tortured again.
- Absolution, Holy Father.
- Yes, yes. But talk!
I saw...
I was casting my nets... before dawn, a troop... five or six men on horseback.
One of them carried the body slung behind him.
Go ahead, talk.
Everything, you bastard!
They stabbed him again.
A masked man apart from the other said...
"Is he finished, Michel?
Are you sure?"
You swear you heard that name?
On my salvation.
And the words, "Are you sure?"
Michel...
I request an audience with His Holiness.
Absolution, Holy Father.
Listen!
A man is coming in.
If his voice is that of the assassins' leader... say so!
And you will have total absolution.
Yes, Your Holiness.
Go in here.
Hide here.
Your salvation depends on the truth.
His Lordship, Cesare Borgia.
Holy Father, someone has dared attack a Borgia.
Cesare, you must find the criminals.
Criminals, my father?
There were several henchmen... but only one assassin.
Do you have any suspects?
The Sforzas, perhaps?
- Or the Orsinis?
- They wouldn't have dared.
Are you sure?
That's the voice, Holy Father.
The voice. It's him.
Who is this man?
He saw the murder.
Or should I say... fratricide?
I swear, Father. It's him.
You have a very loose tongue, my friend.
I'll fix that.
Help! Help!
Yes, I killed my brother.
I'll kill anyone who threatens... the Borgia's greatness!
My brother was your unworthy favorite.
Help! Help!
Come, all of you!
Come witness what I have seen!
Come see my son's assassin!
Is it true?
Are you really locking yourself in a convent?
Yes. I separated you from your Sforza.
Freed you, rather.
Dare tell me you're sorry.
It's not Sforza.
It's my brother.
He'll be avenged.
By you, perhaps?
It's rumored that the duke was murdered by his brother.
And do you know what else?
That I killed him out of jealousy.
That's how far the lies have gone.
Only our unity in public can dissipate such slander.
You didn't really kill him?
Sforza is ready to sign the annulment.
Keeping his hunting dog, of course.
Now I'm alone.
You, alone?
What if I told you I was thinking of another marriage for you?
Another husband... already?
Political reasons, of course.
No. Borgia reasons!
And what I want means nothing!
Wait until you meet him.
Who could your brother have chosen?
A toothless old man?
Or maybe a monster?
Look.
Alphonse of Aragon.
You'll make a lovely couple.
His Holiness the Pope... has named as his forces... those of Cesare Borgia... who will succeed... the Duke of Gandia.
The Duke of Gandia is dead.
No greater affliction... could strike us.
We loved him so... that even the papacy seems worthless... as does all else.
As for the assassin... we know nothing.
We are without clues.
You know why we're here.
We'll eat and drink.
Eat! Drink!
Come on, drink!
What are you waiting for, in the name of Christ!
- I can't get near you.
- I'm getting married.
What a reason!
He's delightful.
He'll still be just a husband.
But I'll love him.
It's time for you to leave.
It's dangerous to be my friend.
Not yet, please.
You were speaking of a special mission?
Yes, a young captain at my sister's house.
Poor captain!
Tomorrow he will be in a fight he doesn't understand.
Straight through the heart.
I hardly ever miss.
Once I knew a duke...
I know, I know.
- A favor.
- All right.
Give me the girl who was standing behind you.
That one?
And?
Give her to me and I'll do anything you want.
She's yours.
The poor boy. So young.
Probably some kind of fight.
All he said was "Lucrezia Borgia."
He who is sitting on the holy throne must know... that he has forgotten his sacred mission.
Injustice and disorder have led you to forget your sacred mission.
I repeat to you... injustice and disorder... have led you to forget your sacred mission.
As for you, you are unworthy.
That is what Savonarola wished to say to His Holiness.
Borgia's troops ravage Italy.
In whose name?
For what cause?
Savonarola has spoken.
The wrath of God is nigh.
I'm so happy.
I never dreamed...
You're crying.
I'm so happy with you.
Lucrezia, my love.
Why are you crying?
That you hold me in such esteem.
Am I wrong?
Why didn't we meet sooner?
If you only knew...
No. Don't finish your sentence.
I waited so long for love.
You already know I love you.
I didn't know what it was to love.
He looks like you.
He'll be a Borgia.
He looks like my husband.
Thank you, my child, for having brought me such joy.
You're happy, aren't you?
More than I ever dreamed.
May I also have an audience?
Have you come from Ferrara?
Your Holiness, I bring you greetings from the King of France... an ally of the Ferraras.
Still utterly happy?
Still, Cesare.
And, thank God, the birth of my child... will stop any dissolution of this marriage.
She's right.
Yet, one is always in too much of a hurry.
Charles VIII dies,
Louis XII succeeds him... and Alphonse of Aragon's hopes for Naples are compromised.
Poor Alphonse becomes completely useless.
At least in political terms.
I believe that for the glory of the Borgias... an alliance between Lucrezia...
I am delighted that your lordship appreciates... the advantages of this union.
Lucrezia Borgia, Duchess of Ferrara.
Of course, but as far as I know,
Lady Lucrezia is married.
True, true... but Cesare Borgia is most skillful... at making and breaking men... according to their merit.
What news of my brother-in-law, good doctor?
The duke is now out of danger.
You'll travel on a litter.
That way you'll be able to stand the trip.
Soon I could do it on horseback.
No. We must be in Naples before that.
The air in Rome is bad for you.
How I wish we were already there... in the gardens overlooking the sea.
Alone with you.
Good news, Lucrezia.
The last criminal was strangled this morning.
Did they confess?
We pulled it out of them.
- So it wasn't a plot?
- Just thieves, as I said.
Thank you, Cesare, for coming every day.
It's not surprising that
I was concerned.
Today I must speak with you.
Leave us, my dear.
There's nothing that I can't hear.
Just a word.
Cesare can talk to you later.
You're still too weak.
Just for a minute, Lucrezia.
You have something... important to tell me?
You be the judge.
All I have to say to you is this:
What happened in the morning can also happen at night.
Why do you stubbornly refuse to see what is happening?
Yesterday it was your son.
Today it is my husband.
And you do nothing.
It's your daughter who must take up arms.
If I were to meet him in the street,
I would spit in his face!
And it's you who are responsible for this!
You're going too far.
Justice will be done.
Your husband had enemies.
Perhaps out of jealousy.
You know there was only one assassin, one enemy... perhaps a jealous one.
- Believe in me.
- In you!
Who still believes in you, Father?
My master has spoken...
"Go and chase him from the throne!"
You let the one man I loved be killed.
Woe to you, Father!
Watch out!
Go down and give orders to push the filth back.
The mob is growing every minute.
My throat would be slit in no time.
They've pushed through the gates!
It's unbelievable!
They're uncontrollable, my lord.
Before God, I swear... that I think only of the glory of the Church... served through the work of the Borgias.
Through your work?
Through your crimes!
What are you doing here?
Why did you flee from Rome?
Why?
Because I was ashamed to be
Lucrezia Borgia.
Ashamed to be an assassin's sister!
And for whom is this mass?
The recently deceased?
- Your last victim.
- Alphonse of Aragon.
The husband you killed... because I loved him.
You're wrong.
This pious ceremony isn't for one dead man.
It's for all those who have possessed you.
- I only loved one of them!
- Shut up! Come here!
Look!
They're all there.
Your companions for a week or a night.
Look.
Filippo, Tybalt...
Mario, Angelico... and countless others whom I have reunited here... for eternity!
Shut up! Shut up!
Have my lord come in.
I introduce the Baron of Villeneuve.
Ambassador for His Majesty,
Louis XII.
I carry His Highness' wishes... to greet the Duchess in person soon... at your home in Ferrara.
Women rarely respond to reasons of state, my lord.
By order of His Holiness,
Alexander VI.
I will be in Ferrara, sir.
I've renounced all personal happiness.
"Savonarola, Relapsed Heretic"
Come, look at your fame, Ariosto.
The book is well illustrated, isn't it?
I'd like you to write others.
The court of Ferrara will be rich in arts and letters.
Right, my dear poet?
Right, Bembo, my dear philosopher?
Good news, gentlemen.
Niccolo Machiavelli is coming to see you.
He'll be delighted to see you.
What is in this letter?
The death of Cesare Borgia.
He died in Spain, sword in hand.
You have heard the news, gentlemen.
The court will be in mourning for three months... possibly for longer.
Clearly, the Borgias can only live in Rome.
Have you pardoned him?
Yes.
You regret nothing?
I did the best I could.
I did what I could for the arts.
I only hope that history... will revere Lucrezia Borgia as a patron of the arts.
Will I succeed?
With history and legend... does one ever know?

Present arms.
Forward march.
March.
Right face.

Column left.
Halt!
Present arms.
Forward march.
March.
Column right.
Forward march.
Forward march.
I wish to speak to His Majesty.
- Who is the gentleman serving today?
- Monsieur de Guémigny.
Please announce the arrival of the Duke of La Rochefoucauld Liancourt.
Good evening, Guémigny.
Could you announce my presence to His Majesty?
I must warn you, Duke.
The hunt was toilsome today.
His Majesty is sleeping like Hercules after his labors.
I beg you, my dear Guémigny. Hurry.
- Is it serious?
- I think so.
His Majesty is not asleep.
Please, come in.
My dear La Rochefoucauld.
Good timing.
I was awakened by mild pangs of hunger.
It was the hunt.
We chased an elk, which are quite rare.
Picard, take that little table and put it on the bed.
My dear Guémigny, give me a glass of wine.
My dear Duke, why don't you pass me the chicken that my good Picard hid from me last night.
Picard thinks that because I am King,
I have some pull.
You're wrong, Picard.
Thank you.
What's wrong?
Sir, the Parisians have stormed the Bastille.
Is it a revolt, then?
No, sir.
It's a revolution.
A VILLAGE IN PROVENCE
JUNE 1790
I saw you!
Your Highness,
I am a poor man.
Of course, it was wrong of me to shoot your pigeon, but he was devouring my harvest, and it is my only means of living.
You, over there!
Come here.
- You will be witnesses.
- I didn't see anything.
No one asked if you saw anything! Just obey.
Take him away.
The case of Anatole Roux, a. k. a. "Mountain Goat. "
He has committed larceny.
This is not the first time.
Last year, my guards caught you poaching on Rouret Hill.
You're very fortunate.
The land belonged to Mr. Giraud, the mayor of the village, who is present today.
His softness spared you from the gallows.
My Lord,
"a coalman is the master of his home. "
This is a clear-cut case.
The pigeon belongs to me, and there are witnesses.
I didn't see anything.
Lords of this village, my ancestors, have bequeathed me with the right to carry out justice.
It is a rather unrewarding prerogative, but I do believe that it is my duty to carry it out without wavering.
Above all things, we are at His Majesty's service.
My good friend, your case is beyond my expertise.
I will transfer your case to the bailiff.
Come on, my Lord!
You know how these judges are.
They have as much empathy as a rock, and they are as intelligent as an old caldron.
All they do is send you to the gallows.
Do you think it's fair to send someone to the gallows over a pigeon?
The pigeon has nothing to do with it, but it is the symbol of the order that I have to defend.
Your symbol is a little scrawny.
Once you remove the feathers, it probably doesn't weigh much.
If we let the peasants kill our pigeons, they will soon burn our castles down.
Ah, so you do admit that it is your assets and your feudal rights you're defending.
Not really
His Majesty's laws.
I am defending both.
If you eliminate these feudal rights that you bother so much, it will destroy our whole social hierarchy, based on respect for natural and divine forces.
From which you also benefit.
So little, though...
I know how the song goes.
You want to make me think that if you lose your privileges,
I will also lose the few assets that I have, right?
So if I want to keep my modest affluence,
I have to justify the exploitation that you live on.
So in the end the interest of the aristocrat who owns half of the region and that of Paul Giraud, former
Master Chief on her Majesty's vessel, should go hand in hand?
Here, I would much rather lose all my assets and...
I am trapped!
You can do what you want with me.
What are you talking about?
Are you mad?
- You're building a fireplace?
- Yes.
It's not built right.
You're not going to tell me how to build a fireplace!
I am a mason.
And I am a good mason.
I am so good that my pals call me Mortar.
What's wrong with my fireplace?
The wind comes from the west.
We're not in town here.
The wind is important.
Here, I have a big one.
Who's that?
I don't know.
By the way, who are you?
- What about you?
- We're from Marseille.
You're hiding from the King's justice?
No, from the aristocrats' justice.
Me too.
We didn't do anything wrong, we're not criminals.
- Me neither.
- We are patriots.
These days, in Marseille, they send you to jail for that.
I killed a pigeon, and it was enough to send me to the gallows.
Do you know the area?
Yes, I was born in Cadolive.
Right there, behind the hill.
The priest is a childhood friend.
So whenever he can, he brings us food.
Would you have a leather belt?
I have one.
It's a gift from my mother.
Here.
That's going to make a great slingshot.
It's the season.
Would you happen to have any string?
- What for?
- To catch some rabbits.
There are lots of rabbits around here.
You seem to be quite a hunter!
I know.
The Count seems to think so as well.
- What's your name?
- Jean-Joseph Bomier.
I am Anatole Roux, but around here they call me Mountain Goat.
- What about you?
- My name is Arnaud.
Honoré Arnaud.
I am customs officer in the port of Marseille.
- So, are you staying with us?
- I would love to.
It would be a pleasure.
But we have to rebuild the fireplace.
Oh you.
This is the good life.
You want a blackbird?
You grab your slingshot and bam!
You have a blackbird.
You want a hare?
You place a piece of string in the bushes, and you catch a hare.
It's just a matter of knowing and observing the mystery of nature, and that's precisely what makes it fascinating.
I'll tell you what.
I wonder why we couldn't stay here for the rest of our lives.
What about your mother?
You don't want to see her again?
Of course I want to see her, but when I realize how I lost my youth locked up under a roof, it gives me a stomachache.
It is as if I had lived in a closet.
I've made up my mind.
I am staying here.
What about women?
I am old.
I don't care anymore, but you two are young.
Maybe we could go get us a pretty girl?
Between all three of us, we could feed her.
And she would help with the cooking.
Yeah, and you would fight because one of you would want to have her for himself. I see.
If we bring everything we don't have here... bread, salt, liquor, women...
I am not even mentioning tobacco, which you can't do without... then it would become a city.
So we might as well go down to Marseille, get a good wash, hunt the aristocrats and the parasites and take advantage of the comfort earned by our parents' labor.
Hello, my friends!
Hi, Fayet.
Well?
Is that how you're keeping watch?
Why would we keep watch?
Nobody ever comes here.
What did you bring today?
Everything a poor priest can find... bread, cheese, tobacco.
This bread is really good.
Thank God you're Arnaud's childhood friend.
He's not doing all this because we're old friends.
No.
I do it because I am also tired of starving.
Our situation could get tears of pity out of the cobblestones where we walk with our worn-out shoes.
You have to turn it over.
It is cooked on this side.
Let me do it!
Are you cooking or am I?
Now that he thinks he's a cook, you can't say anything to him.
What if I told you that I haven't had windows in my presbytery for a year?
Meanwhile, the bishop lives in a palace.
He has mistresses, and he leads a life of debauchery that should make a servant of God blush.
A 22-year-old child.
What a pity.
A young aristocrat is not like the other youngsters.
When we have a baby with a woman, we give him the color of our hair, the shape of our nose.
But when an aristocrat makes love, without much more effort, he automatically gives his seed all the possibilities... politics, the military, the Church.
Therefore, the kid knows everything without having to learn.
We, the priests who only get a fraction of the tithe, we're like sergeants.
And just like our equals in the army, we have lost all hope of ever becoming officers.
I became a widower very early, all my children are dead and I am happy about it.
If the peasants were reasonable, they would stop having children.
This time your rabbit is cooked.
I think you're right.
- Hey!
- Over here!
Did you see the smoke?
Over there... the Pichon Castle is in flames.
And over there, it's the house of my bishop.
It is also in flames.
My children, time has come for you to leave the mountain.
We need you.
All the same, I wonder what they're going to say, those aristocrats.
If someone was burning my house down,
I wouldn't be happy.
If someone sent you to the gallows for 10 years, would you be happy?
Instead of taming us, the masters have given us bad morals.
They have made barbarians of us, because that's what they are.
They will reap what they sow.
They're like harmful animals.
It's not their fault.
God made them like that.
They have to do harm, it's in their nature.
Now that we have sophisticated weapons, we can get rid of them.
Today, I wish my children were alive.
Because y'all, the youngsters, you are going to invent a new life.
Come on.
Goodbye, my friends.
Above all, do not back down.
Goodbye, my old Mountain Goat.
Goodbye, my friend.
Bye, Mountain Goat.
I won't forget what you taught me.
Here, give me that.
You'll have weapons there.
MARSEILLE
OCTOBER 1790
Arnaud, of the Citizen Youth.
Bomier, where's your card?
What do you need a card for?
Don't you know us?
I shouldn't let you in, pal.
I don't understand this bureaucracy.
Do we need a card to participate in the revolution?
That comes from you and your comrades, the writers, the scholars.
You invented all this paperwork to feel important.
You can't bring order with disorder, my friend.
It's a shame.
People of decent background attacked the citizen Maurras, the mayor of Marseille that we just elected.
We want order in the streets!
Absolutely. The reactionaries must obey the law.
And the rich must pay taxes.
Us, conveyors of the Marseille port, we are disciplined workers and enemies of violence.
We stopped the riot when the populace wanted to vandalize the house of the farmer Rebuffet.
We condemn the cowardly attacks against public safety.
It is a way for reactionaries to show their contempt for the people's victory.
Bravo!
He's right.
We have to defend ourselves.
Therefore, you have all our support!
Citizen Moissan is going to speak.
He is going to sum up the situation.
I'm going to sum up the situation.
As the French people witness the admirable spectacle of the King and the nation united in the same love of the public good, a few conspirators are endangering the work of the revolution.
Bravo!
Down with the aristocrats!
We can see them behind the cashiers of the warehouses where they actively raise the price of our daily life.
We can see them in the administration, where they conspire against the decisions that are favorable to our fatherland.
We can see them in the army, right here in Marseille.
The forts of Notre Dame de la Garde,
Saint Jean and Saint Nicolas are in the hands of officers contesting the King's will and our deputies' will.
Shame on them!
Hiding behind the cannons they have pointed on the city, these troublemakers are in control and hunt the patriots.
Send them to the gallows!
In agreement with the new town hall, we, Citizens of Marseille, members of the new Civil Guard, members of clubs and patriotic societies, we have decided to take these forts and deliver them to the authorities that we have elected.
In novels, the sunrise is always magnificent.
That's because writers are never awake this early.
Most of the time when the sun rises, you're cold, it's gray and the colors are horrible.
I know this because I am a painter.
What do you paint?
Portraits?
No, I paint heroes of the Antiquity...
- Romans, Spartans...
- What?
Patriots, you know?
I gave up painting little shepherds and shepherdesses.
That was only good for aristocrats.
Javel, Ardisson.
- I think you can go.
- Come on.
How are you doing, Diogenes?
- Very good.
- Okay. Let's go.
Hey there!
- Open the door!
- What do you want?
We're bringing you some wine.
Wine?
Where does it come from?
From the town of Ravel.
It's a courteous gift from the town hall to the port's garrison.
Okay, I'm coming down.
Go around and use the big door.
Come on!
Come on, let's go!
Come in.
Stop! Leave the barrel here in the corner.
- Why not go further?
- It's none of your business.
Be careful. Slowly.
You're being very cautious with this barrel.
Can't you see that it's an old barrel?
You can't shake wine.
It'll go bad.
You seem to be two very odd birds.
Okay, you can go now.
Come on! Go away!
You're not very generous.
After such an effort, you could offer us a drink.
I'm telling you to go away!
I have instructions.
Come on!
Shake my hand, comrade.
Ouch!
What are you doing?
The nation has come to take the fort!
Be nice and give your guns to my comrades.
There.
You're very nice.
Yes, Javel.
Take it from him.
Can't you see he doesn't know what to do with it?
You, Ardisson, guard the door.
- No problem.
- Come here, you two.
Here, give him your gun.
Guard the prisoners and make sure they don't escape.
- And watch out, they're terrible.
- Shush. Be quiet.
This guard is in there.
Wake up!
Help! Bandits!
- Shut up!
- We are being attacked by bandits!
Don't be afraid, comrades.
We mean no harm.
Alert! Alert!
Ready your bayonets!
Let's not have a useless bloodbath.
Surrender, Citizen Sergeant.
It's better for you.
How many are you outside?
- At least 2000.
Well, in that case, let's surrender.
- Come on, everyone.
- Surrender!
I found the keys!
- Can I go get Cugulière?
- Sure.
Hey! Benjamin!
My friend!
I'm happy to see you.
I didn't know you were a soldier.
We're friends.
We're from the same village.
We're from Aubagne!
- What are you doing here?
- Can't you see?
Standing guard.
- Who told you to?
- Nobody.
I took the initiative.
- Do you have a leader?
- Yes, his name is Arnaud.
He's in there.
Come with me,
I have some tobacco.
- Who's that guy?
- That guy?
Marquis de Saint-Laurent.
He is the commander of all the forts in Marseille.
He's a nice guy.
Here.
Thanks.
Hi, Marquis.
How are you?
I have seen many odd things throughout my long career in the military, but this I have never seen this before.
- How many prisoners?
- How many for political reasons?
- All of them.
We shouldn't have abolished the King's incarceration letters.
- Are you Sir Arnaud?
- Citizen Arnaud.
I am in charge of all the forts in Marseille.
I represent
His Majesty, the King.
I ask you to surrender your weapons and leave, you and your troop.
Cugulière!
Bomier!
What's wrong with you?
My eyes hurt.
It happens to all of us in this fort.
The doctor says there is nothing to do about it.
He said it comes from the toxins oozing from the walls.
What are you doing here?
- We just took the fort.
- No way!
That's good news!
Yes, you can say that it's good news.
What about Arnaud?
Is he all right?
Don't worry about Arnaud.
He's doing better than you.
Come with me.
Long live the nation!
Long live the revolution!
You justify these actions, which I consider to be rebellious, with words that I don't understand.
The nation? Citizens?
What is all that?
The nation is the brotherly union of all French people.
It is you, it is me.
It is the people walking in the street.
It is this fisherman on his boat.
The citizens are the people who form the nation.
But I have nothing to do with these people.
It is a new religion that I cannot accept.
All I know is serving the King.
Or what you guess is serving the King.
When a King is trapped by his conspiring subjects, when he cannot rule freely anymore, his devoted servants have no choice but to guess.
Now, a question:
What are you going to do with me?
I'm going to wish you a good journey to the border, a good stay in Germany, and I wish to never see you again.
Hotel guests are asked to pay their week in advance.
O, how I remember
The pretty place where I was born
My sister, those days in France were beautiful
My country, be my love
Forever forever
My country
Be my love forever
Who will give me back my Hélène?
My mountain and my great oak?
Their memory causes me grief every day
My country, be my love
Forever forever
My country, be my love Forever.
Madame, this song really moves me.
It reminds me of our Provence.
Please, excuse me.
I have tears in my eyes every time I sing it.
Madame de Saint-Laurent, the time for regrets is over.
- You will see France again.
- When?
In three weeks, sir.
At last.
What about you,
Mr. De Boihut?
Will you campaign with your company or will you join the Prince's staff?
I have asked to remain a soldier.
One thing worries me: My shoes are starting to be quite worn out, but it doesn't matter.
To serve His Majesty, we can go barefoot.
Dear Boihut, your shoes will make it until Paris.
This little expedition will be a cakewalk.
I can already see His Highness the Count of Artois arriving in town, sitting casually between Mademoiselle
DePourprix et Madame Delage.
The doors will open in front of him and the people, on their knees, will give him the keys.
The people, delivered at last, will lovingly cheer the white flag and the lily flower.
Even if we have to fight, the revolutionaries won't hold up.
You can't fight with an army of cobblers, weavers and lawyers.
My dear friends, you're forgetting one thing.
What is that, Saint-Laurent?
We haven't always won against the French.
- They will stand their ground.
- Oh, really?
What about Rosbach during the Seven Year War?
Did they really stand their ground against the Prussians?
You've heard the four line poem about Marshall de Soubise.
Soubise says, a lantern in his hand burning,
"I am searching for my army but I do not see it.
It was here yesterday morning.
Did someone take it or did I misplace it?"
Well, today these Prussians are with us.
And the Duke of Brunswick, the winner of that same Seven Year War, is our commander.
I'll tell you what,
I love Prussians.
Since that blessed day that
I learned that they were on our side,
I do not miss an occasion to cheer for them.
I had the pleasure and the honor to get close to His Majesty the King of Prussia in Pillnitz.
I may have told you the story already?
- Oh, yes.
- What a man!
A true Achilles, or even Agamemnon!
You can feel his weight.
And after seeing him, even the most stubborn Jacobin could not say that all men are created equal.
Long live Prussia!
Long live the Prussians!
Madame, I cannot share your enthusiasm.
After claiming so loudly that we were the champions of the Catholic faith, it is a little indecent to go to bed with these heretics.
It's like a carp marrying a rabbit.
If we are rabbits, then let's not be ungrateful rabbits.
Let's show gratitude to the generous carp, without whom we would be starving.
Evidently, this hotel is not Versailles.
- No.
- No.
But without these heretics, we would be sleeping on the street.
And let us not forget that thanks to them, we are going back to France.
Precisely, that is what bothers me.
Two years ago, when we emigrated, everything was beautiful and pure.
We didn't talk about asking money from foreigners.
We wanted our ideas to win, ideas that, whether wrong or right, we consider inseparable from the greatness of our country.
We wanted to do that by ourselves.
Family feuds get resolved within the family.
If you invite the neighbors, chances are they are going to steal something.
My dear. A drowning man can give his watch to the man who saves him from the river.
Your misgivings are valid for low-class people, at best:
Peasants, craftsmen, confined within their narrow possessions.
They cannot have a larger vision.
Their biggest journey is going to the next borough, and when they marry, they marry the daughter of one of their kind.
Their children, their grand-children, will never have any other prospect.
We can understand why these people revel in the word "nation. "
You want to know what their "nation" is?
A group of scoundrels gathering against quality people.
I know another definition of that word "nation. "
I heard it in Marseille, from the man who chased me out of Fort Saint-Nicolas, of which I was commander.
His name was Arnaud.
He seemed to be honest.
And yet, he was a patriot.
If there are a lot of revolutionaries like him, we will struggle.
Monsieur de Fauguerolles and you, Monsieur de Saint Laurent, we beg you to stop your historical discussion at once.
We require your presence to solve a conflict of the uttermost importance.
Let's go.
In Versailles, during the third figure of the Gavotte, do we look to the right when we go to the right or the opposite?
It's very simple. Here.
It's unthinkable. I forgot.
Do you know, dear Saint Laurent?
Pardon me, but I am not much of an expert.
Why don't you ask Boihut?
He used to spend a lot of time at the Trianon.
- Excellent idea.
- M. De Boihut!
It's very simple.
You constantly have to look in the eyes of the person in front of you, while looking over your shoulder.
VALENCIENNES
APRIL 1792
Who's there?
Sorry, citizen.
I thought it was the Austrians.
They're not far from here.
Where do you come from?
From the Grandes Mottes village, on the road to Mons.
Sharp shooters were shooting at the Austrians, so they burned the whole village down, and they arrested all the men.
My husband was taken and hung.
Is it true they have
French people with them?
Of course. Aristocrats.
- It's the Coblentz army.
- That's not pretty.
Citizen, don't you want to rest here, with your child, by the fire?
Aren't you ashamed to rest by the fire while people are hanging my husband and burning down my house?
We really aren't protected in this war.
I wonder what the nation's army is doing.
I heard the Austrians were laughing real hard about you, seeing how weak you are.
Come on.
- Did you hear that?
- Yes.
- She's right.
- Of course.
- Is your ham cooked?
- No.
It's as dry as an old revolutionary.
- It's an old crow.
- We're lucky we found it.
If we had to count on
Lafayette's supply...
I don't like aristocrats.
They let us starve and they betray the fatherland.
What about De Rochambeau?
Don't you know him?
De Rochambeau?
The General.
No, I don't have the privilege.
I know Marat, though.
One time, he came to Rouen and I spoke to him.
Well, when us Parisians arrived at Tournai, that De Rochambeau gathered us in the courtyard.
We were coming from Douai, we had walked all day, so we weren't pretty to look at.
We hadn't shaved since Paris.
You should have seen our beards.
We looked like the Wandering Jew.
Well, De Rochambeau came out of his dwelling, and wiped his mouth with his napkin.
He must have had a real good meal.
He looked at us for a while, he really took his time, as if we also had our belly full.
And he said with an expression of contempt that I will never forget,
"What do you want me to do with you?
You're too short. "
Short? Short?
- How tall are you?
- Almost 5 feet.
- You're a handsome man.
- I'm the tallest in my profession.
- What do you do?
- I am a construction painter in a little village called Les Batignolles, near Paris.
What about you?
I am a cooper in Darnétal, near Rouen.
See, what these gentlemen don't appreciate, is the fact that we are volunteers, and we wear the blue uniform.
It's the fact that we trust the brigade's committees, our parliament,
Robespierre, Marat.
In other words, we are patriots!
Almost all the officers are aristocrats!
For me, anyone who has an aristocratic name is a traitor!
If only they were content with fighting frankly on the other side.
But if they have contempt for the nation, they have less contempt for the stipend that the parliament is stupid enough to give them.
"I take the money and I betray!"
That's their motto.
What is that?
Hussards.
They're going east.
- To surrender to the Austrians!
- You think so?
It wouldn't be the first time.
Remember.
The Berchagny regiment.
It was last Tuesday.
They gave in to the Austrians.
Men and horses.
Judas!
Rascal!
I'll shut you up.
Go away, or we're going to start shooting.
Every horse we kill will be one less horse you will sell to the Austrians.
Come on, we have no time to lose.
Old man, if things don't change soon, between the Austrians and Paris... we'll be the only ones left.
CITY OF MARSEILLE.
FRIENDS OF THE REVOLUTION CLUB
Citizens.
My name is Louise Vauclair.
I am a fish merchant in the customs neighborhood and I pay taxes.
I've come to tell you that on April 21st, near a town up north called Mons, my lover Antoine Givaudan...
That old Tony! He's my pal.
Shut up!
Go on, citizen.
- Sit down.
- My lover Antoine Givaudan... volunteer since 1791,
Sergeant in the 49th infantry regiment, was killed by the Austrians.
And the citizen
Antoine Besombes, trooper in the
16th Dragons regiment, who came back wounded to Marseille and gave me the news, told me that my lover was killed as he was running away from the enemy.
Citizens.
Some of you may have known him.
If this is the case, you know that Antoine Givaudan was not scared of anything.
If he ran away, it is because he was betrayed.
- I know Antoine Givaudan.
- Me too.
- Be quiet, my friend.
- A great guy with a good heart.
I still owe him two écus that he had loaned me.
- We don't care about your stories.
- Citizens.
I have come to ask you if we are going to continue to send our men to get killed in a war where their biggest enemy is not in front of them but behind them.
Well said.
Down with the Austrian committee!
Enough!
I am not even mentioning the aristocrats in the Church who are calling for their country's defeat, because that defeat would reinstate their privileges.
I am talking about the King, about the Queen, about the parliament!
His Majesty, Sir Veto, betrays because he's a fat coward.
Her Majesty, Madame Veto, betrays because she's Austrian... because she is arrogant and because she hates France.
She betrays because she thinks that the army of her nephew the Austrian Emperor will re-establish her absolute power.
She is forgetting that you can't rule people like a husband, and she is forgetting that we, the women, are here.
As for the parliament, they betray out of fear.
These gentlemen would like to have a revolution, but only to their benefit.
If it is to the benefit of the people, they pull the bridle and claim that it is anarchy!
Citizens.
I just want to say a word.
Is it really the role of a woman, to come here at the pulpit and say such things?
Yes!
Well, I say that a woman should remain in her home!
And you should go to the gallows!
Get him out!
They're talking about sending a battalion from Marseille up north.
They say it will go through Paris before going to the border.
But they have said so many things that we have become suspicious.
We need to be sure.
We need to know that our men, before offering their chest to the Austrian cannons, will have carried out justice on the criminal leaders!
Those criminal leaders who put the interest of their caste above the interest of their country.
If we can't be sure of that, we will stand in their way.
They will be forced to stop or step on us.
I think they will stop.
- I'm done.
- Bravo!
Down with the anarchist!
Down with Robespierre!
Long live Robespierre!
Your Robespierre has no eloquence and no dignity.
If you want to know, he's a Republican.
Robespierre?
No eloquence?
No dignity?
Wait a second. We'll see.
Silence!
Citizens, we are all free men.
I ask you to respect this place.
We are the Friends of the Constitution.
A free pulpit where
Jacobin tradition demands that everybody be able to express themselves.
I call citizen Moissan.
Citizens,
I am going to explain why the city of Marseille has decided to send up north a volunteer battalion.
This battalion, just like any other federal battalion coming from all over the country, will go and represent the will of the nation in front of the King and the parliament.
The city of Marseille will demand of every volunteer to swear to go to Paris first, to meet the patriotic groups and the authorities of other regions and to only leave the capital once the patriotic ministers are reinstated.
Severe measures against priests who refuse to comply, against foreign agents and princes, against speculators.
And other enemies of the revolution.
It is only after accomplishing this objective necessary for the sake of the fatherland, that our federal troops will leave to fight the foreign enemy at the border.
The foreign enemy to the gallows!
To answer the accusations of our opponents, who without a doubt will paint a very dark picture of us... the city of Marseille has decided to only enroll in the battalion citizens who can prove to be entirely honorable.
Volunteers will have to prove that they have never been convicted, and that they have enough resources for their family to live while they're gone.
They will have to prove that they have no debt, since this expedition should not be a way to escape one's responsibilities.
They will have to have served either in the army, the national guard or one of the civil battalions.
Citizens, we are opening the first enrollment registry.
Heroes of the South!
Saviors of the North!
Answer the call of the fatherland!
Yes, we will succeed!
We will put the aristocrats to the gallows
Yes, we will succeed
Yes, we will hang those aristos!
Yes, we will succeed!
We will put the aristocrats to the gallows
Yes, we will succeed!
Yes, we will hang those aristos!
Yes, we will succeed!
We will put the aristocrats to the gallows
Yes, we will succeed!
Yes, we will hang those aristos!
Don't stay here, Bomier.
They're waiting for us out there.
- Aren't you coming, Bomier?
- No.
- You're not leaving?
- No.
You're going to let us go to Paris by ourselves?
You're not alone.
There's 500 of you.
- It's your mother.
- It's Marie.
- Maybe.
- I don't understand.
Jean-Joseph Bomier, my old fighting companion, one of the liberators of this city.
You had so many projects.
You were dreaming of open spaces, of sacrifice to the fatherland.
Now that the moment has come to act on it, you're giving up.
You were making fun of Louis XVI's weakness for his wife, and you're doing the same thing?
You're giving up your honor and your dignity for a woman.
Farewell, Bomier.
It is as if my brother had died.
Here, we are proud to speak French
Auntie, all the young men are leaving.
- Where?
- Paris.
I heard that all the young men of Marseille were going to Paris.
I know.
- You're not eating?
- No.
But we made you some tomatoes, the way you like them.
I am not hungry.
What about you? You're not eating?
I will eat after you.
You're the head of this household, the only man in the house.
What would your poor father say if he saw a woman at the table while you're eating?
These old customs are out of date.
Please, sit down.
When you're my age, you're set in your ways.
Why aren't you eating?
Is it that you're going to Paris but you don't know how to tell me?
No. I'm not going.
I am happy to see that you've become reasonable.
Where would all this agitation lead you?
Why fight people that are stronger, richer, better armed than you?
It's David against Goliath.
Believe me, there will always be rich people and poor people.
Your friends won't change anything about that.
But then, if it isn't because you're leaving... why aren't you eating?
Are you in trouble?
Yes.
Because of that creature?
What's wrong with Clemence?
If you don't understand, then you're blind!
Only men go look for something that they already have at home.
What did she do to you this time?
- She left again?
- Yes.
But I don't care.
And she took some money from you?
She didn't take it.
I gave it to her.
She said she wanted to buy a business.
So I am in debt now.
I can't leave because they won't take you in the battalion if you're in debt.
All my best friends...
Arnaud, Cugulière, Garnier,
Moissan, Ardisson... the best men in town.
They're like brothers to me.
They are all leaving, and I am staying here.
And believe me, they are going to see a lot in Paris.
You know, strange things are going to happen there.
Meanwhile, I will be here tormenting myself, looking at these roofs, this little street, that little piece of sea over there.
I won't be able to handle it, because
I have already seen them too much.
Well, listen.
It's very simple.
Write to your uncle in Cassis.
Since he takes care of our possessions, tell him to sell our vineyard.
He has money.
Maybe he will buy it himself.
You're the head of this household.
You can do whatever you want.
Thank you, Mom.
I'm going to register right away.
There are so many of us, and they will only take 500.
Auntie.
Please close the window.
Let's dance the Carmagnole,
I love the sound of the cannon
Madame Veto had promised to cut every Parisian's throat
But her plan didn't succeed, thanks to our cannoneers
Let's dance the Carmagnole,
I love the sound of the cannon.
You swear to be committed to the revolution?
- Yes.
- You swear you have no debt?
Let's dance the Carmagnole,
I love the sound of the cannon.
- Can you sign me up?
- Hey, old pal.
- Well, hello!
- I'm here to sign up.
You have to stand in line.
Where are you going, Bomier?
Get out of here!
Quiet!
- You have your certificate?
- Yes, here.
How come you're not signed up yet?
- I was delayed.
- Me too.
I was in Avignon.
I was doing a painting for the town hall.
I painted Brutus killing the traitor Caesar.
Move move.
I painted 1500 residents of Avignon, dressed up as Roman soldiers.
You can recognize every single one of them.
I think we're right on time.
They already have 450 men.
If they weren't so picky, they could send more than 100,000 men to Paris.
Move, move.
- What's going on in there?
- I don't know.
There is a banquet to honor the Montpellier delegates.
Apparently, the federal troops are already set to go over there.
Too bad we're not leaving with them.
I heard that around Tarrascon, there is an army of 50,000 aristocrats, well-armed and lead by Capellans.
- Capellans?
- Yes, dissident priests.
You really think there's 50,000 of them?
- At least.
- Move.
Don't close the door.
We want to hear what they're saying.
Arise, you children of the fatherland
The day of glory has come...
- Who's singing?
- Mireur from Montpellier.
- What is he singing?
- I don't know.
Move move.
...has raised its bloody flag
Do you hear, in the countryside
The howling of these fierce soldiers?
- Good bye, then, Bomier.
- Good bye, Javel.
Next.
Jean-Joseph Bomier.
- You have your certificates?
- Yes. Here they are.
Do you swear you have no debt?
Do you swear your family can live during your absence?
I swear it on the nation.
Arnaud, Bomier is signing up.
Cugulière,
I am happy to see you.
I knew you would come back.
Sign up, citizen.
What are you waiting for?
Let an impure blood flow in our veins...
I like that song
Mireur was singing but it's not exactly the way things are.
Come on, Bomier.
Row to the right.
Why say, "To arms, citizens, form your battalions" when they're making it difficult for citizens to actually form their battalion just because they're poor or in debt?
Stop talking, pal.
You'll talk tomorrow.
Yeah, that's some revolution!
A revolution where the glory of serving the fatherland is reserved for citizens who pay taxes.
Let it grow a little bit, the revolution is still in its childhood.
The rich started it, the poor will finish it.
- Yes, but when?
- I don't know.
We may not live until then.
That song Mireur was singing, where does it come from?
He heard a workers choir sing it in Montpellier.
They learned it from a Jewish peddler who heard it in Strasbourg.
It's called "The Hymn of the Rhine Army. "
But who wrote it? The soldiers of the Rhine army or the Jewish peddler?
None of them. I think it's a guy called Desile, or Delisle.
He's an engineering officer.
- Where is he from?
- I don't know, pal.
Well, he's certainly not from the South.
There's something in that song that smells like the North.
Something barbaric and pretentious that I don't like.
- Well, what do you like?
- Hey, I am not a musician, but it seems to me that a song should be written
- according to the rules of harmony.
- Rules of harmony?
That's for aristocrats.
To me, that hymn was deeply touching.
It's like the echo of my own thoughts.
I don't know what you see in that song.
I think it's a passing trend, and in two weeks everybody will have forgotten about it.
To arms, citizens, form your battalions
March march!
Let an impure blood flow in our veins!
To arms, citizens, form your battalions
March march!
Let an impure blood flow in our veins!
Sacred love of the fatherland
Support and guide our avenging arms
Liberty, cherished liberty
Join the struggle with your defenders
Under our flags, let victory
Hurry to your manly tone
So that in death your enemies
See your triumph and our glory!
To arms, citizens
Form your battalions
- March march!
- You're singing?
Yes, I am singing just to join in.
- Let an impure blood...
- Gathering!
Flow in our veins!
Gathering!
At attention!
Present arms!
At attention!
Rest!
To arms!
Okay.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
Let's go.
One two three.
What do they want, this gang of slaves...
Horde, not gang!
Horde, gang...
I don't see the difference.
- Anyway.
- Come on.
One two three...
What do they want, this horde of slaves
Of traitors and conjugatorial kings?
Conspiratorial, dimwit!
Conspiratorial, conjugatorial... see?
This song is full of words that we can't pronounce.
I give up.
Sir, I am the oldest priest in town.
I wanted to tell you that I will pray for your success.
Do you see that Capellan who is talking to Moissan?
Yes.
It's the vanguard of the reactionary army.
No kidding!
His poisonous language is more dangerous than that of the sirens.
Javel, you are an incorrigible pessimist.
Why would a man be reactionary just because he is wearing a priest outfit?
You have no right to forget what the priests have done for the revolution.
We are going to charge soon.
The best soldier is the one who remains calm and collected while he charges.
If your moves are hurried, you can spill your powder on the ground.
Watch out.
One. Arm your weapon.
Your left hand is placed on the first barrel, your right hand on the handle and your arm against the butt.
Two. Open the chamber.
Three. Take the bullet.
Four. Tear the bullet.
Five. Initiate.
Just put enough powder to fill up the chamber.
May I remind you that this is what gives power to your weapon.
The powder that isn't in the chamber will not be in the barrel to push your bullet.
Then, close the paper of your bullet between your thumb and your forefinger.
Six. Close the chamber.
Seven. Put your weapon at your left side.
Eight. Put the bullet in the barrel.
Nine. Pull out the stick in two movements.
10. Move it back and forth twice in the barrel.
11. Put the stick back.
12. Carry your weapon.
Do you understand?
You need boots of the right size, and a good bundle of hay inside of them.
With that, your feet will smell like roses when you get to Paris.
What are you talking about?
If newspapers weren't so expensive... there's nothing better than paper.
All this is a joke.
The best is a good candle, nicely melted.
The most important is to grease the space in between your toes, and then you walk as if you had wings.
Look at the bushes I found.
Just like in Marseille.
We also have a federal soldier in Montalban.
There's only one, and it's my nephew.
He went to Paris.
In secret, obviously, because of our reactionary town hall.
Since you're going there, can you give him a message?
Yes, but where will I find him?
In Paris!
His name is Besson.
Jules... just like me.
He is easy to recognize.
He is tall and blond and has freckles.
Ah, okay.
And what is the message?
First, I would like you to give him these 20 francs.
Once you've crushed Sir Veto, before you go do the same thing to the Austrians at the border,
I want him to have a feast!
It will be done, I promise.
What's the second message?
I would like you to teach him the hymn of the people of Marseille, that you and your comrades were singing earlier.
Ah, the "Hymn of the Rhine Army"?
You like it that much?
Yes, and for us it will always remain the hymn of the people of Marseille.
Well, I will teach him.
I promise.
To me, the most beautiful verse is the one that was written in our honor by a good teacher in Vienne...
"We shall enter in the pit when our elders will no longer be there. "
Hey, Arnaud, you want some roasted pig?
You should have seen all those youngsters reciting what they had written the night before.
It happened in front of the temple of Augustus and Livy.
Give me some roasted pig,
Cugulière.
Here, Mr. Livy.
My friends, it was so beautiful.
Here.
I will make a painting of it.
I will call it
"The France of Tomorrow in Front of the Remains of Ancient Rome. "
What are we waiting for?
I heard a cannon had fallen in a hole.
A cannon in a hole?
That's unlikely.
They're only saying that to reassure us.
What do you think?
- I think we have arrived.
- Where?
In front of the Capellan army.
- Sure.
- Yes!
We are all sitting here on this bench, and all of a sudden, they will all come out of the forest when we expect them the least.
A cannon in a hole?
That has to be a joke.
- Maybe it's a famous hole.
- An aristocratic hole?
You're right, actually.
This is a royalist district.
They leave the roads in these horrible conditions to prove that ever since we abolished the corvée labor it is impossible to travel in France.
They always use the same tactics.
They try to show the people that the measures taken by the revolution are causing disarray in public life.
Arnaud, your pants are torn.
Give them to me,
I will sew them.
And if we have to leave, I won't have any pants... a sans-culotte!
And Javel will make a painting out of it!
Let it go!
- Go ahead!
- Sergeant!
You will be at the vanguard with Massu.
Yes, Sir.
The body is not damaged.
It's only the wheels.
If we take care of it, we can use it again.
Say, who knows what they will say in Paris when they hear our Marseille hymn?
Moissan's idea to sing it as we come into town may be very dangerous.
Dangerous?
I've always told you... this hymn will unite all French people.
It will be like a new federation.
And when the Parisians hear these magnificent lyrics, they will do what everybody else did.
They will cheer and they will sing with us!
The Queen will be terrified and go back to her country on the Danube...
- With the Croats...
- Sure, with the Crabs.
The King will remove his veto and recall the patriot ministers, and in two weeks, we will be eating sausages and sauerkraut in Vienna, the capital of Austria!
The Croats only eat candles.
How ignorant!
Say, Bomier.
Didn't you say that this hymn was a passing trend?
That everybody would forget it in two weeks?
Did I say that?
Where?
And When?
Near the Chateau d'If, the last time we went fishing on a boat, Mr. Bomier.
Precisely, Mr. Arnaud.
I do remember it quite well.
I even told you that this hymn was like the echo of my own thoughts.
How long have we been walking?
- 25 days.
- It feels like a century.
At least.
Be patient.
We'll be there soon.
Who knows? Since we left, a counter-revolution may have happened.
You think so?
What? You think that Robespierre is going to welcome you on the Faubourg Saint Antoine?
Not a chance!
In the name of our Lord, amen.
"I, Sebastian Girard, declare my will as follows:
"An annuity of $5,000 to my widow,
Agnes Girard, during her life.
"My cotton mills, plantations...
"and all my cash and securities
I leave to my sons...
"Richard, Carlos and John, as common property.
"And I direct them to enter into a most solemn compact...
"to act together for the advantage of the family.
"I appoint my son Richard and my friend
Gabriel Warburton, of Manchester, England...
"to be my executors...
"and direct that branches of our business shall be established in France and Prussia...
"by my sons, Carlos and John, respectively.
"All interests of the firm in the United States of America...
"shall be in the charge of my son,
Richard.
"And I direct that the partnership already arranged...
"between Gabriel Warburton and myself is to be completed...
"thus establishing the firm of Girard and Warburton...
"in the four principal countries of the world.
"If my will is not carried out in every particular...
"the whole inheritance is forfeit.
"Fourth day of August, 1825.
Sebastian Girard."
Are the terms of the will clear,
Mr. Richard?
Almost pointedly clear.
Your father always knew what he wanted.
I've done business with him since before the war... and I don't remember when he didn't.
Sorry I am to have missed him.
Let us get back to business.
This partnership-
I'm sure my brothers and I welcome any association... which will bring us into closer relationship with Mr. Warburton.
What's his idea, tying everything up in the family like this?
Security. Cotton's a necessity of life, thou knowest.
Why in all these different countries?
Ah! Look at the situation in Europe.
See how unstable it is.
And this mess-up over that treaty of peace. Might blow up any moment.
Why, surely people aren't so foolish as to be thinking of another war.
Trouble is, wars come without thinking.
Well, they oughtn't to, according to the Bible.
But there's a lot of money to be made out of war.
A merchant's got to be practical.
And what does the merchant's wife say to that?
The merchant's wife lost her father at Waterloo... and her brother was crippled for life in the fighting outside New Orleans.
She hates war.
You had a brother at the Battle of New Orleans, ma'am?
I was a corporal in the New Orleans militia.
I counted the British dead after the battle- over a thousand of them.
I hate war too.
There is no challenge to the terms of the will?
Are the executors prepared to undertake their duties?
- Certainly.
- Yes.
The partnership is to proceed?
And the establishment of the branches in France?
- And Prussia?
- Yes.
It is a solemn thing you are all undertaking... this family compact.
It has all the moral force of an oath.
Ah, that part don't affect Warburtons.
Oh, yes, Gabriel, we're in this too.
We blend the two families into one family.
We all solemnly swear... to safeguard the family... to deny ourselves for the family... and, in all circumstances, to put the needs of the family first.
And this shall be binding on our children... and on our childrens' children.
The family.
The family.
So it's all settled, and you're off for England tomorrow?
That's right. And glad I'll be to get back to business too.
Though it's been a grand holiday at that, thou knowest.
We shall be sorry to lose you.
I'll be sorry to go, lad.
Hearts is trumps.
Shall I be very brave, madam?
If you must.
Your husband, Mr., uh, Warburton, has been boasting about you.
Oh, you mustn't believe all he says.
Oh, I do not.
He says that you are the soul, the- the very pearl of virtue.
- But I say, how can anyone so lovely, so beautiful-
- Is this a joke?
- May I tell you in my own-
- Where's my husband?
Allow me to act for him.
My dear Girard, we can't both do that.
Charming.
Now I shall go and talk with some friends... and, uh, perhaps they will talk with you.
We must find my husband.
Oh, the matter's finished.
And I'm so ashamed it happened in my house.
Please say nothing to your husband about it.
Let me take you to my mother.
John. Carlo.
Let the Englishman fight his own quarrel.
It's not his quarrel.
They're our guests.
She was insulted here in our house.
It's our quarrel.
Gentlemen, I shall say,
"Take aim. Fire."
When I say "fire," you'll fire at once.
Ready.
Take aim.
Fire.
What's that?
You look almost like a conspirator.
I thought I'd come back and make sure you were all right.
Of course I am.
Don't you think you might find my husband?
He's playing whist.
Must we disturb him?
- No, but-
- l-
I was so anxious he shouldn't be disturbed about that little affair.
You're leaving in the morning.
He needn't be told, need he?
I suppose not.
I don't like mysteries, but if you'd prefer-
It's very hard to tell you how sorry I am you're going.
It's been a great privilege to know you, ma'am.
That sounds very formal... and very final.
Aren't you coming to visit us in England?
I don't think so.
But it was all arranged, wasn't it?
All the same,
I think it's better not.
Don't you?
I can't imagine why.
My mistake, ma'am.
I beg your pardon.
- What is that song?
- It's something my brother Carlos made up.
He's very romantic.
Runs in the family, doesn't it?
Perhaps.
Is there any more of this song?
Don't you like it?
Mr. Girard, I really must go now.
You've been much, much too kind to us both and-
What's the matter with your hand?
You're hurt.
- It's nothing.
- Those shots.
Richard.
Oh, my dear.
- It's nothing, Mary. Nothing at all.
- You-You fought that man.
Let me fix your bandage for you.
We all solemnly swear to safeguard the family... to deny ourselves for the family.
Oh, Richard.
Why were we born out of our time?
My dear. My dear.
That's good.
There's nothing left but to say good-bye.
Shall we never meet again?
No one can foretell the future.
Come, Mary, my lass.
Time you were abed.
You've all your packages to make up for tomorrow, you know.
Good night, Richard, my lad.
Come. Bustle, my dear. Bustle.
We have to be aboard by 6:00, thou knowest.
Good-bye.
I shall see you in the morning.
Please don't.
It- It's much too early.
Good-bye.
I am your humble, obedient servant, ma'am.
Hey, turn tother way, lass.
That's direction to home.
Oh, come here.
Come here.
- What is it?
- Look, the Statue of Liberty.
Turn this way, Mary.
Turn this way and look at America.
- Why, Daddy?
- Because I jolly well tell you to.
Oh, orders.
Columbus discovered America.
Did he?
Do you know any more?
Wunderbar.
They tell me the population is mostly foreigners.
- Well, so are we, aren't we?
- Ja, Papa.
Wait till you all get to New Orleans.
Dad! Where is everybody?
I beg your-
Who are you?
Mary Warburton.
Who are you?
Richard Girard.
Say, haven't we met somewhere?
Well, I was wondering that.
Have you ever been in England?
I've never been anywhere but America.
And I've never been out of England.
Well, I give it up.
I'd swear I've seen you somewhere before.
This is fun, because I feel the same.
Well, you're here for the great family reunion of course.
Yes.
Say, tell me, what are they like- the others- the foreigners?
Don't you consider
English as foreigners?
No. Do you think Americans are?
- No.
- Good.
Well, who's here, anyway?
I just got back from a vacation.
My train got in an hour ago.
I don't know a thing about them.
My father, for one.
I met him when I was a kid.
He was over here about 10 years ago, in 1904.
Oh, he's not a foreigner anyway.
Who else?
Um, Erik von Gerhardt.
He's one of your German cousins.
They changed their name from Girard to von Gerhardt... you know, when they got their title.
And Erik's father, the Herr Baron von Gerhardt.
And his mother, the Hochwohlgeboren Baronin von Gerhardt.
Anybody else?
Uh, Henri Girard.
He's French. He's one of your other cousins.
The immortal Mr. Manning-
- Did they all come on the boat with you?
- Yes.
Just my luck.
They know you already.
You don't like them, do you?
Do you usually ask as many questions as this?
When I'm-When I'm interested.
Well, never mind about them anyway.
- What'll we talk about? Do you like this room?
- Mm-hmm.
They call it the family room. It's where the firm was founded. You know, 90 years ago.
I've, uh-
I've appropriated it for mine.
Yes, it looks a little as if it might have been appropriated.
- Except for the piano.
- Well, that's mine too.
Do you like music?
I do.
Mmm.
Go ahead, play something.
This is the room where the firm was founded
Over 90 years ago
- Go on.
Have you ever heard this tune before?
Yes.
Now don't say you wrote it, because I have.
No, you haven't, all the same.
It's an old tune.
I dug up the manuscript in this house.
I can't help that. I have.
It's a song. There are words.
What are the words?
I can't remember, but I think
I'd recognize them if I heard them.
No, I guess you wouldn't.
They've never been published. Listen.
Once on a summer's day
A shepherd and-
Those aren't the words.
You're right, but how the dickens did you know?
I don't know.
I must've heard it before.
- Should she desire me not-
- Go on.
And all my dreams be vain... gladly I'd take the part...
to hold her in my heart.
Go on.
Since in my arms to lie... she doth disdain.
Since in my arms to lie...
she doth...
disdain.
My son, Richard.
- You know Sir John Warburton.
- How are you, Sir John?
How are you, Richard?
Ooh, you've grown, my boy.
A fellow does grow in 10 years, sir.
True, true.
I might have expected it.
The, uh-The Baron and Baroness von Gerhardt.
- Hello, Richard.
- How are you, sir?
- Madame Girard.
- Your cousin, Henri Girard.
- Hello, Richard.
- Hello, Henri.
- And little Jacques.
- Bonjour, cousin.
- Bonjour, Jacques.
Mr. Manning.
Very delighted to make your acquaintance, I'm sure.
You've met Mary, I see.
This is Erik.
- Hello, Richard.
- Hello, Erik.
More or less engaged, you know.
Oh, nothing public, but of course, in the family we-
This is the family room.
Richard uses it as a sort of den.
He'll have to move out for the ceremony.
Quaint.
A very moving experience.
I remember, 40 years ago...
I was called on, in this very room... to pronounce the words of our family compact.
It was the greatest moment of my life... until now... when I call upon my son Richard... to repeat our time-honored pledge.
We all solemnly swear to safeguard the family...
to deny ourselves for the family... and, in all circumstances, to put the needs of the family first.
- The family.
- The family.
Last year, 1913... was undoubtedly the most prosperous... this great family business has ever known.
Whether here in New Orleans... at our great factories in Manchester... at Lille, in France or Düsseldorf, in Germany... the story has been the same- undiluted prosperity.
At Manchester, in England, we've more than trebled our output.
This has been largely thanks to our Mr. Manning...
- the general manager.
It's a great tribute to the wisdom of our founder... that this great family enterprise... should have withstood all shocks and difficulties... and lead, preeminent, in the world.
Baron von Gerhardt.
Of the activities of our business in Düsseldorf...
I say just this:
The German dyestuffs and chemical industry... stands acknowledged at the vanguard of the world.
And the Fabrik von Gerhardt... is just as far in the lead from all other German industries.
Last year, 1913... we captured the golden...
and both the copper medals...
of the Fine Arts Fabriks
Exhibition in Vienna.
I say, with a father's pride... that we owe something of this to my son Erik... for his brilliant scientific researches.
I wish to pay tribute to our allied family house in France... because especially of the lamented death... of my dear friend Jean Girard,
Henri's father.
You must forgive this
"sentimentalish" old German to say... the one thing that consoles me... is the coming marriage of my other boy, Fritz... with Jeanne, the sister of Henri- the marriage to which you will all come, of course, this spring in Düsseldorf.
And I wish to say how welcome you all shall be.
And I wish to say again-
Ach, ja. I talk too long.
I say it not.
The health of my gallant sailor son...
Oberleutnant zur See
Baron Fritz von Gerhardt... of the Imperial German Navy and his lovely bride, Jeanne.
Their marriage is, for me, a profound symbolism...
of the future of Germany and France.
So can the peace of Europe be always secure.
- Uh, and- and when I say this I forget not England.
- Ah.
So might by some, uh...
alliance in our family house be symbolized... the age-long ties and affections... between Germany and England.
And I wish to say again that-
Ach, ja. I, uh- I talk too long.
I say it not.
Very good.
I would-
Again. The health of the bride and the bridegroom.
Oh, magnifique!
Bravo!
- Oberleutnant!
- Ja, Hans?
Au revoir, Jeanne.
Marie, c'est pour toi.
- Omen!
- Omen! Ja!
- Yes, it is an omen.
If I am lucky, we shall all soon be here together again.
Only, I shall be sitting where Fritz has been sitting, and Mary-
- Erik, don't.
- Oh, I should not speak of it, huh?
Oh, now I have let the cat out from the bag.
That's all right, my boy.
This is the most wonderful thing. I, uh-
Mary, liebchen.
- Liebchen.
It is a secret-
Aren't you going to dance, Richard?
I don't think so. Thanks.
I like this place. Don't you?
You'll like it better, I expect, when you're married to Erik and settled down.
Yes, l- I expect I shall.
When's the, uh, happy event?
Oh, I don't know.
Sometime.
We're all going down to Munich tomorrow... and then we're going down to the Austrian Tirol.
- Won't it be fun?
- Great fun.
What's the matter, Richard?
Nothing.
I said it'd be great fun.
I see you take your pleasure seriously.
I don't intend to take this pleasure at all.
Aren't you coming?
Haven't they asked you?
- Yes, they've asked me.
- Well?
I'm going to Paris with Henri. Tonight.
But why?
Well, I'm going to take my pleasures seriously.
I'm going to do a little work.
Industrious apprentice.
Not on your life. He usually ends by marrying the master's daughter.
Doesn't that depend a little on the daughter?
I'm no good at this epigrammatic stuff.
No, you prefer being a bull in a china shop.
I'm not ashamed of that.
And I don't care two hoots about the master's daughter.
Anyway, l-
I couldn't make her care two hoots about me, could I?
Of course you couldn't.
So what in the dickens we're talking about, I don't know.
Well, Erik, congratulations.
Have you fixed the happy day?
You thought of August, didn't you?
I can't imagine a better time.
Almost anything might happen in August.
Well, what about the first week in August?
Why not make it the first day in August?
- Yes, why not?
- Why not?
All right then, the first of August.
Richard, are you coming?
Yeah, sure, I'm coming.
Good-bye, Erik.
Thanks for a grand time.
I've said good-bye to your father and mother.
Oh, my dear fellow, you're- you're certainly not leaving us.
We'll never get our train if you go into that. So long, old man.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
- Oh, Erik, why did you do it?
- Do what?
Why did you make that silly speech and spoil everything?
Oh, but I thought we-
Oh.
Oh, I've been a fool.
You are in love with Richard.
Is that it?
I'm not in love... with anyone.
We must have made quite a night of it.
I'm darned if I know if it's tomorrow morning or next week.
As a-As a matter of fact, l- I think it's yesterday.
Well, something's wrong. It's broad daylight.
Must be the hunting season, I guess.
War?
I'm goin' home
I'm goin' home
No more to-
- Man, where'd y'all get them-
- Bonjour monsieur.
Where you get them suits from?
L-Lookit, I tell you, you know, that's some lodge y'all belong-
I belong to a lodge too in New Orleans.
See, I'm a Noble-
- Yeah, I'm the Noble Sons of- of the-
- Yeah, New Orleans. I'm goin' back tomorrow too.
Yeah, see, I'm over there with Colonel Collier.
You know Colonel Collier, the racehorse man?
- Yeah, racehorse.
- Yeah! Well, man, I tell you.
If I carried one of them suits back, it'll be somethin'.
You know, imagine if I carried-
How'd y'all get in-
Why don't you figure so I can join that... and I can carry one of them suits back with me?
- You see?
Yeah. I'll buy you a drink of liquor.
I'll buy you some of this cognac over here.
You been over here so long, you talk just like them.
Uh, look- I tell-
Why don't you fix it so I can join that-
Look, man, get me one of these hats.
- Bravo!
- Bravo!
Well, here's a pretty kettle of fish- at war with one of our leading customers.
What are we going to do about it, eh?
What are we going to do about it?
I thought I might see about obtaining a territorial commission.
My family's always been associated with the army and-
Obtaining a territorial grandmother.
Do you think they want potbellied old gasbags in the army?
I beg your pardon, Sir John.
I beg yours, Manning. I beg yours.
But for heaven's sake, let's talk sense.
The government has declared a moratorium.
We've got shipments of cotton all over the world... likely to be confiscated or sunk at any moment.
Now don't you realize this war is liable to bankrupt everybody?
- Sir John?
- What is it? What is it?
- I'm not to be disturbed, Clumber.
- A cable, sir.
Oh, thank you.
The stock exchange is closed.
Everything in the world is-
Manning, you'll have to go to France.
Uh, see if the French family want any money or help or any-
- Uh-
- Now listen, don't argue. Don't argue.
Mary, do you think you can take this situation calmly?
- I hope so, Daddy.
- So do I, my dear. So do I.
But can you? Can you?
That's the question.
I'm going to make you a partner in the business.
Somebody must take some of this routine off my shoulders.
Do you think that you can face responsibility?
I'll try. Daddy... is there any news about Richard?
If he's got any sense, he'll be on his way back to the States.
Allez! Allez! Allez!
Vite! Vite! Vite! Vite!
- Boy, that was a close one.
- We shall have to abandon the factory.
The Germans are closing in on the town.
Yes, I'll tell Sir John what the position is.
He's arranged for a credit at your banker's in Paris.
Well, uh, good luck, gentlemen.
- Oh, Mr. Manning.
- Yes?
Uh, Miss Warburton, is she all right?
Well, she's been suffering a little from the hay fever lately.
Heredity, you know.
Unbecoming but quite harmless.
- I'll tell her you were asking.
- No, don't do that, please.
- Well, then I'll use my discretion.
- No, Mr. Manning, please.
- Monsieur Henri Girard?
- C'est moi. Merci.
From Uncle Charles in the war office.
My class is called.
I must report at once.
Allez! Allez! Allez!
- Allons Jacques.
- Au revoir mon père.
- Au revoir mon fils.
- Au revoir cousin.
- Au revoir Jacques.
- Au revoir.
- Hurry, Mother.
The road may be closed any moment now.
Allez! Allez!
What about you?
I think I'll sort of stick around.
What? You don't understand, Richard.
This is war.
I have to go into the army.
Just the same,
I think I'll stick around.
Why are you so quiet, Richard?
- What are you thinking about?
- I'm thinking of my father.
- He's all burned up because I'm in on this.
Really, Charles, you mustn't be so severe about Richard.
The boy only did what he thought was right.
What he thought was right?
My son has no quarrel with Germany.
Come and have a drink.
Don't be so intolerant.
A man with Richard's responsibilities has no business running himself into danger.
It's all very unfortunate.
But now we're in it, we've got to go through with it.
You'll realize that when you get to England.
You talk, John, as though the United States were in it.
We're not, and we're going to keep out of it.
I hope you will, Charles. I hope you will.
Two scotch and sodas, please.
- Yes, Sir John.
- Here.
I think Europe is insane.
Six months ago, you were all at a wedding in Germany.
Well, here's fun.
- What was that?
- Whoa!
The only thing is work, Miss Mary.
You mustn't give way.
You're head of the business now, you know.
It was always your father's wish that you should take over after his... death.
I'll help you, if you'll let me.
Bless you, Miss Mary,
I'll help you any way I can.
I know you will.
Now there's another thing.
We have to try and see
Mr. Richard Girard.
Richard?
He's named in your father's will as cotrustee and executor.
But l- I thought he was in America.
- He's in the French army.
- What?
He joined up in that Foreign Legion.
He's in it... too.
Wait here, will you?
- How are you, my dear Richard?
- How are you?
I'm delighted to see you.
You're looking splendid, splendid.
Now just a minute.
Wait. Just a minute.
Now, uh-
Now, whatever you say, don't mention a word about her father.
She can't bear to be reminded of it.
It's not my favorite subject either, Mr. Manning.
Well, then you'll-you'll excuse me for mentioning it, won't you?
- Of course.
- I have to think of Miss Mary, you know.
- How is she taking it?
- Oh, wonderfully, wonderfully.
She's taken quite a grasp of the business.
- Yes, you'd be surprised.
- Um-
I couldn't have done it better myself.
- You'll remember, won't you? Of course.
- Yes.
Richard.
I'm so glad to see you.
You're looking wonderfully well.
It's quite a sanitarium where I'm living.
Come and sit down.
L- I've got just millions of things to ask you.
- Do take off that funny hat.
- Well, l-l-l-
- Oh, Mr. Manning.
- Huh?
Uh, please don't go.
Oh, uh, well-well, very well.
We, uh-We have to have a little talk, haven't we?
Well?
As you know, Richard, we have to consult you about factory policy.
Of course, Miss Mary has complete discretion.
Consult away.
What's it all about?
Well, it's about munitions.
The government wants us to make high explosives.
Oh.
I can't make munitions, Richard.
I can't do it.
But you ought to, Mary.
After all, we've got to have them.
That's what I tell her.
L-It's a patriotic duty.
Incidentally, it's a- it's a duty to the stockholders.
You can leave the stockholders out of it.
They can do without their blood money.
Oh, now, Mary, dear, isn't that a little bit far-fetched?
Is it, Richard? Do you think
I'm being unreasonable?
- I do, rather.
- But I'll do anything constructive.
- What, for example?
- Well, make bandages, surgical dressings, sheets.
Gun cotton isn't the only cotton product.
Why not let her take over some of the looms, make her surgical dressings?
Well, the trouble is... the government may want to take over the factory.
I can't help it if they do.
Well, I think you ought to do what your government wants you to.
I think I must decide for myself between right and wrong.
Of course, but-
I will not make munitions.
Well, that's that.
I think you better count me out as far as that will's concerned.
I wish you understood, Richard.
I wish I did too.
- I've gotta be getting back up the lines again.
- Not already?
My permission expires in two hours.
But won't you- won't you just stay and have dinner with us?
I can't, really. I got to make the better part of 20 kilometers jumping trucks.
Well, if- if ever you're in England... will you come and- and see us all?
You bet I will.
Sure. Good-bye, Mary.
Good-bye, Richard.
Good-bye, Mr. Manning.
Oh, Richard, why do we always quarrel?
You know, I can't understand a word that man says.
Oh, that's what it is?
I can go make that now.
Hey, get back here.
Needs washin'.
Is this what he's talkin' about?
I didn't know he wanted that razor down in there.
Can't you find no better place than this to hide?
- I-
I gonna find a place of my own, man.
Miss Warburton, I'm sure you'll understand that it's not my wish to disturb you... in the fine work you're doing.
Suppose we run over to Chilton now, Colonel?
Mmm, yes. L-I'll do that.
L-I assure you, Miss Warburton...
I only want to carry out the wishes of the ministry with the least possible friction.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, Colonel Braithwaite.
- Yes, Clumber?
- Beg pardon, miss.
There's a sort of a Tommy out here.
You know, private soldier.
- Give him a pass to the canteen.
- He's not that sort of a Tommy, miss.
He's a sort of a, you know,
French soldier.
He's asking to see you.
- Ask him to come up then.
- Very well, miss.
Richard! How on earth did you get here?
How did you manage it?
I'm so glad to see you.
I can hardly believe that you're here.
How did you get leave?
I'm convalescent.
Henri's mother worked it.
Convalescent?
You're wounded.
I've got some special bandages here.
Some elastic bandages.
They're-They're simply wonderful.
Let me re-bandage your arm for you.
Mary, please listen.
I'm in love with you.
I've always-
- Darling, if I get a special license... will you marry me right away before I go back?
With this ring, I thee wed.
With this ring, I thee wed.
And with all my worldly goods, I thee endow.
With all my worldly goods,
I thee endow.
May I help with your dress?
It belonged to my great-great-grandmother.
Somehow I seem to recognize it.
Yes, I feel I've worn it before.
Did I do that that other time you wore it?
It's a strange thing.
I don't believe you did.
Did you dream it all too?
Only, sometimes,
I couldn't believe it.
- And now-
- What?
Now I'm so afraid I may lose you.
I have a queer feeling that... we lost each other before.
Must you go back?
Be a sad ending to my convalescent leave to be shot at dawn.
I have to report back to the regiment in three days.
Of course you must.
Let's- Let's just remember that other time when we met first.
Where did we meet that time?
In the room at New Orleans, where we met this time.
I thought that too.
I knew it as soon as I went into it.
Did we love each other as much then as we love each other now?
Nobody could love anyone as much as I love you.
Richard, can't I help you?
Darling, the woman just doesn't exist that can fit all these gadgets into a musette bag.
I won't need that over there.
Let me keep it.
Gosh, it's five to!
I'll miss that train.
- Come on. You ready?
- I've been ready for nearly an hour, darling.
You'll look after yourself, won't you, darling?
And keep your feet dry and don't stand about in wet clothes.
Sure. That's in regimental orders.
Our nurse is very strict.
You'll write me every day, won't you?
And sometimes twice and three times a day.
Sure. They're very particular about the boys writing home.
Don't let the other soldiers coax you to take whiskey.
And keep away from the lassies.
You'll mind and say your prayers, son.
I'm sure you will, every night.
I'm glad we thought of walking, aren't you?
By the way, something ought to be done about notifying the French authorities... that you're my next of kin.
You're entitled to a penny a day separation allowance.
Don't spend it all at once.
It'll have to be done through the French consulate.
Or maybe you wouldn't want to be bothered about your separation allowance.
I insist on my separation allowance.
I shall keep it in a large money box as an endowment fund... for the Girards of the future.
You let me know quick if there's any chance of that.
- Do you want it to happen? Very much?
- Very, very much. Don't you?
Be sure to write to me.
Well, darling, time to say good-bye,
I guess.
Darned nuisance, this war, isn't it?
Good-bye.
I never told you. I think you were dead right not to make munitions.
- Um, you speak English, I understand.
- Ja, Herr Oberst.
- Well, let me hear you, please.
- English is just the same as German to me, sir.
Very good.
Well, you are attached to my staff... for special duties interrogating prisoners of war.
Uh, uh, please.
Now, uh, we strike tomorrow at the junction of the British and French armies.
Over here on the left is the English Second Brigade of Guards.
On the right is the French Foreign Legion... holding that big cemetery.
Now this operation is being followed very closely in Berlin.
It has a political, as well as a military, significance.
You understand what
I've been talking about?
Only too well, sir. I have two cousins in the Foreign Legion.
One of them is married to an English cousin... who was to marry me.
Well, uh, we can't be sentimental about things like that.
No, Herr Oberst. A family like ours has no business to exist when there is a war.
We have to forget about families.
We must at all times put the fatherland first.
- But, Sergeant, ain't we in a graveyard?
- No, Dixie.
- Yes, but-
- Cemetery.
Cemetery?
Cemetery.
I sure ain't gonna try to join no more lodges.
Initiating people like this, they're liable to kill 'em.
Hey, Dixie!
Dixie! Dixie!
Are you all right?
Oh, Lord, Sarge, my hand.
Looks like that's the end of the war for you, Dixie.
- Sir?
- You can go on back.
- I can leave?
- Yes, Dixie. You'll never be able to use that hand again.
Oh, that's all right.
I ain't no piano player.
- Oui.
- Here they come.
Hey-
Richard! Richard!
Richard!
Richard! Richard!
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women.
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Ri-Richard.
Richard.
Richard.
Richard! Richard!
- Richard!
- Come in.
I'm extremely sorry to intrude.
But the fact is, the ministry have turned down that Wilson Hume idea...
and insist upon taking over your premises at once.
- So?
- I beg your pardon?
I'm afraid I've got to ask you to hand over today.
- But surely, madam, it's plain enough.
- Colonel Braithwaite...
- I hardly think this is-
- I'm not accustomed to arguing with civilians, sir.
Now, my dear madam, I'm sure you aren't going to make it difficult for me.
Is anything the matter?
I've just had a telegram from the French War Office.
My husband is missing.
- Richard.
- Richard, my dear boy.
Would you like to come with us and stay in our house?
You remember, dear, Erik's house, where you came to the wedding.
And we have letters from Mary.
They came by way of Switzerland.
She's well and happy, and she says you are to get strong quickly.
And she sends you her love.
And she's waiting for you to get well soon.
And I've got an order, so I may take you on my parole to our house.
So you must get very strong very quick.
And we are so glad to see you, my dear boy.
And I wish to say again that-
These are Mary's letters.
- Jawohl.
Well, you are down today.
That's better- much better.
Still sort of rocky, I guess.
I don't seem to remember... things.
What happened to me?
You were blown up by a shell in the big battle in the spring.
What-What spring?
What year are we in?
I feel like Rip van Winkle.
It is October, 1918, Richard.
And the war is still going on.
Seems once you start a thing like that, there's no way of stopping it.
Oh, God, it's terrible. Who wanted such a thing except a few fools?
You, the Allies, have been nearly smashed.
And now for Germany, it's coming to the finish.
We are trying to make you some soup... but there is nothing- no meat, no butter, no milk.
Only ersatz- substitutes.
Straw for bread, acorns for coffee, ja, and some turnips.
And every house is like this house.
If we are lucky, one egg a week.
Coffee? Nein.
Beer? Nein.
Fleisch? Nein.
Some potatoes, perhaps.
And look in this kitchen.
Everything of rubber, commandeered.
Everything of copper, commandeered.
My copper medals.
I tell you, Richard.
Whoever wins this war, we are all ruined.
There's no longer any family.
There's no longer any Europe.
- I know you, don't I?
- Why, your cousin!
You remember Jeanne, who married Fritz.
Sure. Sure, I knew it.
What a long way back that seems.
How's Fritz?
- Fritz-
Fritz is dead.
He went down in his ship- a submarine.
So it's over... at last.
Yes, we've won the war.
We've won the war.
And between us all, we've torn down everything that matters- faith, freedom, civilization.
Richard comes back to me in a week.
Just now, nothing else seems to matter to me.
- So it's all over.
They look so sad. So sad.
Armistice Day can't be much fun for the losers.
It is terrible.
There is no longer a Germany.
- Erik!
It is inspiring to meet here tonight...
100 years to the minute... since the founding of our great family business in 1825.
Some people thought the war would break us.
But we're stronger than ever.
And we're a happier family than ever.
Henri today is taking up the life of a priest.
And we all love and respect him the more for that.
He's transferred all his rights and interests to Jacques, his brother.
Jacques has done a fine job... in preparing himself to take over our rebuilt premises in France.
In Germany, thanks to Erik, we lead, as we've always led.
In England, at Mary's wish...
I, myself, have taken over control with the able help of Mr. Manning.
Manchester seems to be holding its own, in its own peculiar way.
Aye, it is that.
In the United States, we've reached a position of power and prosperity... greater than ever before.
And that's all, I think... except to have our time-honored pledge repeated by our youngest.
We all solemnly swear to safeguard the family... to deny ourselves for the family... and in all circumstances, to put the needs of the family first.
- The family.
- The family.
All right, now.
Let's get this straight.
In Germany, we buy up Blumenthals, Moyers, and the Allgemeine Chemische Fabrik... and amalgamate as the All-German Dyestuff Combine.
- That sets us back how much?
- $48 million.
- Fifty million.
- Call it 50 million for a round figure.
Then in France, we acquire those seven firms and form the Syndicate d'Initiative.
What's that figure, Jacques?
Twenty-four million?
- Twenty-five.
- Twenty-five million.
The New Orleans figure is big.
$100 million.
But it puts us in absolute control of American raw cotton... and we're solid, because cotton's a necessity of life.
Manchester is hanging back.
I'll fix them. I'll put in Warburton's.
The rest will follow.
Do you think you should put in Warburton's without consulting Miss Mary?
Of course I'll talk it over with her.
Say, don't be such a killjoy, Manning.
We're in on the biggest and the safest deal in the history of commerce.
Sometimes I've a feeling that the real Richard isn't there at all.
It's nonsense, of course.
We don't believe that to be nonsense in my faith.
I want it to be nonsense.
It frightens me.
For an outside expenditure of 250 million, we control the world's cotton goods output.
We can write our own prices!
The banks are with us.
We can get the money tomorrow.
Oh, Mary,
I'd like to have a word with you.
Listen, darling, everything's all lined up for the world cotton combine.
It's the biggest thing ever.
We've got everybody important in Germany, France and the United States.
And I'm taking in Warburton's, of course.
- What for?
- What for?
We buy you out with corporation stock... and you sit back and look pretty for the rest of your days.
- I don't like it.
- Mary, are you crazy?
The Warburtons can't compete with the combine. It's not economic.
Mass production- that's one of the lessons of the war.
- There's no use arguing about it, darling.
- I'm not arguing, dear... but, I was just wondering.
Now, you're not going to pit your business knowledge against mine, are you?
Warburton's is coming in with us.
And listen, all this is only a beginning.
The Allied Industries Combine is the next step.
Darling, it'll make you just about the richest woman in the world.
You can buy up half of New York, and all you have to do is sit back and draw dividends.
How's it strike you, Henri?
It reminds me of someone who said...
"All this is yours if you will fall down and worship me."
You understand- shell shock.
I'll go and talk to him.
Poor old Henri.
- He's right.
- Rubbish.
All that old-fashioned nonsense means nothing in the modern machine age.
It means everything.
Oh, for heaven's sake, what's the matter with being rich?
For us, I mean.
I never see you now.
That means a lot to me.
Darling, I'm so busy.
I never look at another woman.
No, you never look at anything but your bankbook.
Well, I'm making money for you.
No, Richard. You're making money for the power that it gives you.
I suppose that's because we haven't any children.
Nonsense, darling.
Children are such a responsibility nowadays.
You once said you wanted them more than anything else in the world.
Well, you get over that sort of primitive stuff, I guess.
Does the wonderful romance of our lives mean nothing to you anymore?
It means everything.
Just you let me get this deal straightened out... and we'll go away for a grand holiday all by ourselves.
Away from all this madness?
Sure. We'll head straight back home.
I tell you what we'll do.
We'll get the yacht, fill it up with a good crowd of the boys-
Keep in touch with the markets that way-
Richard! Richard!
We've got Berlin on the phone.
That's my call to the All-German Combine.
I'll tell them Warburton's are in, Mary.
What's it now?
Here it is. American Cotton Combine- two and a half, two.
Two dollars a share!
I bought a block of 100,000 at 60 yesterday morning.
Paris on the wire for Mr. Girard.
Hello. Yes.
- Erik, Paris.
The banks have called our loans.
- But they have our stock.
- $8 million in gold, or we're out.
- Erik, get Berlin on the phone.
Tell the bankers to transfer-
- I'm sorry, Richard.
But, Erik, you've got to!
We must stand together.
That's the point of the will, to protect the family when one branch fails.
But we've all failed.
The German banks are closed.
There's no money anywhere and no credit.
Well, I've still got credit- the best in New York.
- I'll stem this tide.
- But you're $6 million in the red, Richard!
I've just come from the floor of the exchange.
The richest men in the world were there, ready with billions of dollars to stem the tide.
They saw what was happening and walked out.
Well, they've got 'em scared.
They've got everybody scared.
What is it, darling?
What's the matter?
Something pretty bad.
What is it, Richard?
What's happened?
We're ruined, I'm afraid.
Bankrupt.
It's all my fault.
- Warburton's?
- Warburton's may just pull through.
Old Manning's moved pretty fast.
The rest is... finished.
The French firm's gone out on us.
The All-German Combine's closing down.
And the banks have taken over in New Orleans.
There isn't anything illegal about it, is there?
I haven't forged or stolen anything, if that's what you mean.
Don't talk like that, darling.
I seem to have been such a prize hellhound to you all the time.
That doesn't matter. Nothing matters as long as we've got each other.
Try and get some sleep.
You look so tired and wretched.
I can't.
I haven't slept in a week.
This crack-up, it's terrifying.
It all seems to have happened in a single night.
Where's the world heading, Mary?
Somewhere beyond our wisdom, darling.
Don't fret yourself.
Come in here.
And you're so very sweet to me.
Do you really care about me still?
You know I couldn't care about anybody else.
Well, about the last time we'll ever meet together as a family.
It's each one for himself now.
This family idea's worked out, old-fashioned.
- What is a family anyway?
- The basis of our present civilization.
Hmm. That's pretty well finished too, isn't it?
Oh, come. There's life in the old girl yet.
Is there anything further before I close the meeting?
Has anyone anything to propose?
Well, speaking for myself,
I'm going to have a holiday- the first I've had since 1914.
After that, I'll- I'll see.
Cheer up, Manning.
Things will come right again.
- What's to make them?
- Faith.
In what?
What is there to believe in?
Look at the situation in Europe, in the east, everywhere.
There's hardly a country in the world that isn't drunk with nationalism.
All building armaments, all attacking each other's trade and destroying it.
Faith is not a matter of argument.
It's whether you believe or don't believe.
Hear, hear.
- Hello, darling.
- Mary.
All the same, it's nationalism that's smashed us.
Why, we couldn't even trade with each other... between the very branches of the same firm.
A lot of humbug, I calls it.
I've had the furniture and the heavy luggage taken over by the shipping agents.
They're sending it direct to New Orleans.
Is that all right?
Absolutely right, darling. Yes.
The fact is, there's no way out except another war.
It's beginning to look like that.
- What did you say?
- I said we're heading for another war.
You must be mad, Jacques.
Everything our family has labored to build for 100 years... has been crashed to bits by the last war.
How can you even think of another one?
Things sometimes get so knotted, that we have to cut our way out.
War is nature's way of eliminating surplus people.
Then what a pity to interfere with nature's other ways of eliminating surplus people.
Why not shut the hospitals and let disease have a free hand?
Why spend millions on child welfare?
So that the guns shan't go hungry?
Is that the idea?
Oh, but disease has nothing to do with it.
Disease has everything to do with it.
War is a disease- homicidal mania on the grand scale... brought on by fear and jealousy.
We know all that, but can't you understand?
Has it ever occurred to you that there are women in the world about to become mothers?
That's just sentiment.
Why generalize?
Because I happen to be one of them.
And you dare to tell me that the world is preparing for another war.
- Home.
- A bit dilapidated, but it belongs to us anyway.
Wait until we get the furniture in.
Oh, isn't it thrilling to be here?
I have a curious sense that- that we're beginning all over again... as though we were still boy and girl.
As though we just found out we care about each other.
Y'all hurry up and grow up around there...
so you can do some of this heavy work.
Don't you think I never get tired.
- Hiya, Mrs. -Welcome home, Mr. Girard.
- Hello, Dixie.
All the stuff done come.
The box stuff and the furniture-
Course, I didn't have time to do much.
You've done plenty.
Yes, sir.
I did the best I could.
Say, "Welcome home" to Mr. Girard, y'all.
Welcome home, Mr. Girard.
Say, "Welcome home, Mr. Girard."
- Welcome home.
- And smile.
That boy gonna be just like me.
Say, "Welcome home."
We're going to be so happy in this place, darling.
And here's where we'll put the nursery.
How strange it looks.
Everything's gone.
Not everything.
Lighten our darkness, we beseech thee, oh Lord.
And by thy great mercy defend us from all perils and dangers of this night.
Order arms!
After eight long years.
The curtain of separation is about to be drawn.
The military scene closed forever.
You have been valiant soldiers.
You have met every hardship.
Even the extremes of hunger and nakedness.
With extraordinary patience and fortitude.
The unbiased voice of the free citizens of the United States.
Has promised you a just reward.
The money due to you brave men.
Must inevitably be paid.
You are going forth to mingle with the great body of the community.
Some of you, through the pursuit of commerce.
Some to the cultivation of the soil.
Others, to the fisheries.
And some of you, actuated by the spirit of adventure ..
Will push on to the vast, unknown regions of the West.
It is my earnest opinion.
That upon your patriotic support of the Union.
And the federal government.
Our future existence as a nation .. depends.
And so ..
Your General offers his prayer to the God of armies.
That ample justice be done to you all.
You who have secured great blessings for others.
And bid you all.
An affectionate.
A long farewell.
Tell Colonel Hamilton
I should like to see him.
General.
─ Oh, there you are.
Well, I've parted with the men.
Yes .. I heard you.
It was a hard job saying goodbye.
But not as hard as it will be to part with you, Alexander.
No-one will ever know what you've meant to me in this campaign.
You've given me a kind of support.
Not only as a soldier but .. your advice.
It's hard to put these things into words.
But I thank you for it.
And I love you for it.
General.
Well, I suppose you'll be going back to the law?
I am not so sure.
What are you going to do?
Go back to Mount Vernon as fast as my legs will carry me.
Home.
And a garden.
And a river running along at the foot of my ground.
Thank heaven the war is over.
Over.
Well, we've just signed a treaty of peace.
Don't tell me there's another fight ahead.
You now that for you and for me ..
The struggle is only just beginning.
For you, perhaps.
But my work is finished.
While the war was on.
The 13 States were held together by a common cause.
But now, the war is over.
And we shall have 13 jealous States ready to fly for another's throats.
Ha, that's true.
Soldiers have to be paid.
You just promised them their money. Who will pay them?
Each State will try to shift the responsibility on to the other.
America will be without credit and without honor among nations.
Unless it has a great leader who has gained the country's confidence.
General Washington, there is only one man for the post.
You always were the darnedest devil for facing facts, Alexander.
Won't you let me die in peace?
General, I won't let you die at all.
Then you must stand by me.
For I don't know the way to fight politicians.
We are both tired of fighting.
But we can neither of us give up ..
Until this country has paid its debts.
At home .. and abroad.
What good did the war do us?
Independence .. liberty.
Ha .. things are worse than ever.
Where is the Army pay?
This is all I got.
"The State of South
Carolina promises to pay .."
"Harvey Taylor the sum of one hundred dollars."
That's eight years ago and they ain't paid yet.
Here is the same thing from the State of Connecticut.
Those certificates today are not worth ten cents on the open market.
Why hasn't Washington kept his word?
He promised we'd be paid.
That was before they made him President.
It ain't Washington. It's Hamilton.
What do you mean?
Washington does what Hamilton tells him.
They are both crooked if you ask me.
─ I agree.
Hello, Reynolds.
─ Hello, Zachary Whalen.
You'd agree with anyone who was willing to buy you a drink.
Melissa, some ale.
Alexander Hamilton has been made Secretary of the Treasury.
And he don't do a darned thing.
He did one darn good thing.
You had a job in the Treasury and he gave you the sack for dishonesty.
Now I can explain that.
Why don't Hamilton see that these certificates are paid?
All he does is sit in his office and put down figures.
What good will that do us?
There ain't enough money in the Treasury to pay us.
Well, why ain't there?
Because the Senators are always fighting against one another.
Alexander Hamilton and
George Washington ..
Are the only two men with brains in the country.
Oh.
What about Jefferson?
─ And Monroe, and Senator Roberts?
They'll be another bloody revolution in this country before long.
And it won't be against a foreign power.
─ Shut up, Reynolds.
Where were you during the war?
You never did a days fighting in your life.
Oh ..
Well, there is no use arguing about it.
I object to Alexander
Hamilton's high-handed ways.
Who is he to call us all here together today?
Senator Roberts.
We should have refused to come.
─ Senator Monroe.
We cannot afford to ignore
Hamilton's importance.
Although his energies are perhaps, misdirected.
Mr Jefferson.
Senator Roberts is right.
Hamilton has his finger in every pie.
And we don't want any more Kings in this country.
Kings.
Who wishes to be King?
─ George Washington does.
And Alexander Hamilton wants to be Prime Minister.
Wants to be. He is Prime
Minister at this very moment.
Prime Minister of America. Ha!
Come, come.
Don't let's lose our tempers.
Mr Hamilton no doubt called this meeting for more debate upon his Assumption Bill.
That Bill is an outrage!
Let every State pay its own debts.
Why should North Carolina pay the debts of Connecticut?
We've always blocked that Bill, and will continue to block it to the last ditch.
Yes .. Hamilton's efforts are dangerous.
Because they are always directed towards a centralization of the government.
And that would lead to monarchy. The very thing we fought to get away from.
Ah, there you are, Mr Hamilton.
Gentlemen, I trust I'm not late.
It's exceedingly kind of you to respond so quickly ..
Cut the fol-de-roll and get down to business.
Mr Roberts, I'm afraid
I interrupted you.
Won't you sit down?
That is the chair that President
Washington always sits in.
Gentlemen, what I want ..
─ We know what you want.
Your game is to keep on strengthening the federal government ..
Until the States shall eventually have no rights at all.
My game is to establish the credit of this country ..
So that it can trade with other nations.
And it is a game which requires at least four players.
Do you know, Mister
Secretary of the Treasury ..
I am opposed to any attempt at centralisation of power.
And for the same reason ..
I'm opposed to your scheme for the establishment of a national bank.
National bank? Rubbish. A wild idea.
And besides, it is not constitutional.
─ Well, it's all part of my policy.
What is your policy?
I can tell you in one word, Senator Roberts.
Honesty.
You may remember that line in your copybook : "Honesty is the best policy."
I mean, in your college days.
Before you became a politician.
I never went to college.
We can't all be aristocrats.
Mr Hamilton.
I stand on the platform of the rights of man.
The rights of the individual.
The rights of the individual States.
"Honesty is the best policy" applies to States ..
Just as surely as it does to individuals.
It is a policy for the
United States to pay its debts.
The gravest danger that threatens America today.
Rests with those men who are striving to centralize the power of the United States.
How are we going to pay our debts without a central government?
This country has no credit abroad.
It's the laughing stock of other nations.
It's paper isn't worth five cents in the dollar.
Why?
Because as a nation, we are not to be trusted.
We haven't paid the merchants who gave us credit during the war.
We haven't paid our soldiers who fought for our liberties.           ─ Soldiers?
This country will put a stop to George
Washington's coddling of the army.
He treats them as if they were his own relatives.
I'm sure you're not comfortable in that chair.
No, I'm not comfortable in this chair.
I wasn't made to occupy a throne.
Virginia paid her soldiers.
That saved the honor of Virginia, but not the honor of the nation.
Has South Carolina paid her soldiers? Has Rhode Island?
That's no affair of Virginia.
We're not going to pick the pockets of one State to pay the debts of another.
Each State fought for the common good.
Every man must be paid.
Gentlemen, we are building a nation.
Let us build strongly. Let us build on a foundation of honor.
You plead for the honor of the nation.
I plead for the rights of the individual.
Do you realize the rights of the people are at stake?
The only safety for any people ..
Is in a government that can pay the nation's debts.
You mean, by passing your Assumption Bill?
Yes, gentlemen.
That was my object in calling you together today.
With your permission then,
Mr Secretary of the Treasury ..
I will withdraw.
─ And I.
I am bound to confess.
That I consider your attempt to force this Bill ..
Nothing more than a trick to give greater power to the central body.
And to ruthlessly crush the freedom of the States.
At least, Mr Secretary of State ..
I have had the pleasure of listening with admiration to your eloquence.
Aye, you're right there.
Tom Jefferson is an all-fired good talker.
You know, Hamilton.
There are some things about this Bill of yours that ain't so bad.
Coming from you, Senator Roberts,
I consider that a compliment.
I don't know.
I might be persuaded to change my vote.
You'd like my vote, wouldn't you, Colonel?
I should indeed.
And I should like your influence with your party.
You know.
I can swing enough votes to put your Bill through.
And I'll do it. But on one condition.
Don't make it hard for me.
I won't make it hard for you. I'll make it easy.
Now .. in that copybook of yours, when you was at college.
Do you remember that line about ..
"A fair exchange is no robbery"?
I'm not sure that you and I were brought up on the same copybook.
Now listen to me, Hamilton.
The President always asks your advice.
If you will say that Tim Roberts is the right man for Minister to France.
Tim Roberts will put through your Bill for you.
Minister to France?
Oh, I see. You don't think I'm good enough.
I don't think you're fitted for it.
─ Why not?
With the revolution going on over there.
The task of our Minister is probably the most delicate ..
Oh, I ain't delicate enough? What else?
You're not making it easy for me.
─ I want your reasons.
I prefer not to give them.
─ What have you against me?
Speak up.
─ Everything!
I know your record during the war. Dishonest business.
You compelled me to speak.
The United States Minister to France ..
Must be a man of unblemished reputation.
Alright, Mr Hamilton.
You're a fighter, ain't you.
Well, so am I.
From now on, you're fighting me!
Get your Bill through if you can.
Go on.
Senator. Remember .. your copybook.
Don't forget .. there is honor among thieves.
Here is Senator Roberts.
He's a friend of the people.
Fellow citizens. You are right.
I am your friend.
And I'm going to do everything in my power .. to help you.
I've just been talking to our
Secretary of the Treasury.
I didn't get much satisfaction out of him.
Hamilton is an .. aristocrat!
Down with Hamilton. Down with him.
What made you do that?
Senator Roberts said you wouldn't help us.
He told us.
Were you a soldier?
─ Yes.
You nearly got me.
He must have been a sharpshooter.
Were any of you men at
Monmouth or Trenton?
Yes, I was there.
We pretty near got licked.
Were any of you at Valley Forge?
Yes, plenty.
I nearly froze to death. Froze my foot.
You trusted Washington.
Through those days of cold and hunger.
You must trust him now.
He's still your friend.
Just as he was then.
─ He's right.
If any man had good cause for complaint.
Washington was the first to listen to him.
And give him justice.
Wasn't he?
A cheer for Washington!
Let him go.
A cheer for Hamilton!
Hello, Zekial.
Why .. Master Hamilton.
You've come at last.
You'd better don't let
Miss Betsy see you.
You scallywag. What do you mean?
Where is your Mistress?
─ Bless my soul.
She's looking out of the window for you most of the time.
Am I late, Zekial?
─ You sure is.
You was more than late for tea, Master Hamilton.
Is that you, Amiable?
─ Here I am, Betsy.
Zekial is detaining me.
Betsy.
─ Amiable.
I'm afraid I'm late, darling.
You've got too much to do.
That's what's the matter.
Is the foreign mail in?
Yes. But there is no news of sister.
No news is good news.
Well .. how did the conference go off?
A grand success.
Why, I am so glad.
Yes. Everybody talked and nobody said anything.
Nothing was done and everybody was pleased with themselves.
Oh, Alexander.
A great deal of mud was thrown at me .. but only one stone.
And I dodged everything.
What do you mean? Not really a stone?
Well, it might have been a brick.
You see, when things are flung at the Assumption Bill ..
They have to hit me first.
Oh .. then we had music.
Music?
─ Yes.
Jefferson sang to us.
Sang?
Well .. he didn't exactly sing.
But he made fine oratorical speeches.
And he listened to the music of his voice.
How long is this going to last?
When am I really going to see something of you in our own home?
Very soon dear, I hope.
Just as soon as I can get those thirteen States to hang together.
I'm not complaining.
But I sometimes wish you didn't care quite so much for your country.
Betsy.
Zekial, where is your Mistress?
Having tea, General.
─ Alright, Zekial.
I'll go straight in.
Betsy.
Why father, what is the matter?
I've had news from London.
─ It's Angelica? Tell me.
Yes Betsy, your sister is worse.
She needs you.
Her husband is there with her.
─ Yes, but he writes me:
"She's always calling for Betsy."
Alexander, I must go.
My dear.
─ Yes, I must go to her.
When is the next boat?
─ Tomorrow morning.
The William Pitt sails at early tide.
Oh.
Come and help me pack.
That's my Betsy.
Excuse me, father-in-law.
That's my Betsy.
Come along, father.
Can I help you, father-in-law?
─ I'm alright.
A fine looking ship, isn't it.
Yes, beautiful.
Then I think you'd better go aboard.
Are you sure you've got enough food to last your Mistress the whole trip?
Yes, sir. Them's the hams ..
The smoked tongue, the dried beef, and them's the best biscuits.
Where is the tea?
─ Right in here, General.
Miss Betsy sure loves her tea.
Aye.
Be careful. Here, let me take care of those eggs.
Thank heaven they're not broken.
Them eggs won't break, General.
Won't break?
─ No, sir.
Because they is boiled.
Goodbye, Zekial. You'll take good care of your Master won't you.
Indeed I will. And you take good care of yourself, Miss Betsy.
Goodbye, Betsy.
Goodbye, father.
I ..
I'd better get down that gangplank.
Betsy.
This is from our garden.
I picked them this morning.
Rosemary.
Yes, Betsy.
For remembering.
Sweet.
All visitors ashore.
I tell you one thing, Tom Jefferson.
You've a fight on to get the capital of the United States for the South.
Yes. And I'm afraid it's a losing fight.
I hope the South don't count on it too much.
Well, Monroe will be able to tell us.
If that coach ever gets here.
Here it is now.
Late, as usual.
My luggage.
Well, howdy, Jim.
─ Hello, Monroe.
Come on, let's sit here.
Well, what's the feeling about the site of the capital?
Yes, yes. What news?
The news? The news is, I want a drink.
─ Yes, of course.
What's the feeling of the Southern States?
I've been bumped and shaken over 700 miles of the worst roads in existence.
I've visited every town.
Every plantation of any importance.
Brandy.
─ Yes, yes.
There is just subject on everybody's lips.
That is that the capital of these United
States has to be located in the South.
I thought so.
─ It will be a fight to get it.
Well it will be your last fight
Tom Jefferson, if you don't.
You don't know how they feel about it down there.
They don't care about anything else.
And they don't talk about anything else.
If you don't swing this, Jefferson ..
─ Our goose is cooked.
I've got to swing it.
But we can't get it without Hamilton.
A fine chance we have of getting him.
He'll stand out for New York of course.
But we've got to get the capital for the South.
We've pledged ourselves to our party.
And if we don't get it, we're done for.
I've heard them talk.
And I know.
Hamilton would have great influence with Congress.
I think we'll have to try a little .. persuasion.
What? Go begging to Hamilton?
Well, perhaps we'd better pay him a friendly call?
Well, count me out.
I guess it's our only hope.
Hamilton's word would have great influence with the President.
If we can only make the people believe that the Secretary of the Treasury ..
Ain't been playing fair with the nation's money.
Why, we'd have the whole country in our pockets.
He's honest, Senator.
We've tested his honesty.
Yes, we've attacked his honesty from every angle. He's always beaten us.
Well, you go if you want to.
It don't suit me to go begging or paying friendly calls on Alexander Hamilton.
So good day, Tom Jefferson.
Good day, Monroe.
Then you and I will call on him today.
A friendly call.
You know, Senator ..
More flies are caught with molasses than with vinegar.
Zekial.
Yes sir, Master Hamilton. I is wise.
Remember, I'm out.
Yes, sir. You is out.
Good afternoon, Master Schuyler.
─ Hello, Zekial. Where is your Master?
Master Hamilton? Why, he is out.
I'm in, Zekial. I'm in.
Come in, General.
Why, you rascal.
You said he was out.
He done tell me he's out when he's in and in when he's out.
I don't know where he is.
General, it's good to see you.
First of all, what news of Betsy?
Her letter gives little hope ..
Of her being home for several months yet.
Angelica is still improving?
─ Yes, but slowly.
I miss Betsy.
You should get out more. Enjoy yourself.
Let someone else run the country for a change.
By the way.
I met Jefferson and Monroe this morning.
They asked me to tell you that they'll call on you today for a friendly chat.
A friendly chat?
That sounds fishy.
They want something.
From what Tom Jefferson said, I think it's about the location of the capital.
Oh, the Residence Bill.
Well, where do they want the capital?
In Jefferson's parlor, I suppose?
Exactly.
They want the capital of these
United States to be in the South.
Well, why not?
You mean to say you'd let the capital of the United States go to the South?
Where do you think it should be?
Where? Why, Albany of course.
Your home town.
In your parlor, I suppose.
No, no General. Certainly not Albany.
Why, "certainly not Albany"?
I suppose you want it in New York?
─ No.
Where in heaven's name do you want it then?
Anywhere that is handy to get at.
So long as we have the right men inside.
Seriously .. I think it should be an entirely .. new city.
That's an original idea.
Where?
Oh .. somewhere central.
On the Potomac.
─ Ah, the Potomac.
You think it should be in the North. Why?
Why? I'll tell you.
In the first place, all our country's great and glorious and traditions ..
Cluster about the North.
─ There is some truth in that.
It was here in Philadelphia that the
Declaration Of Independence was signed.
So it was.
It was in New York where
Washington took the oath of office.
It was in New York where the government had its beginning.
And as for Albany.
Why Albany commands the commerce of the four corners of the earth.
And there isn't a plain bit of reason why the South should have it anyway.
I declare Jefferson and
Senator Monroe calling to see you.
Show them in.
And you'll give them the capital of the United States without a struggle?
General.
I wonder if they feel as strongly about the location of the capital as you do.
Why any man with a grain of ..
─ General ..
I'm going to send you outside on to the balcony to cool down.
Father-in-law.
If I could only get hold of Jefferson and Monroe.
What, to back your Assumption Bill?
─ Yes.
If you could only get hold of the moon.
Outside, and keep quiet.
I declare Jefferson and
Senator Monroe, sir.
Mr Jefferson.
Senator Monroe.
How do, Hamilton.
─ Won't you sit down.
Mr Hamilton.
We've come to have a little chat with you.
I am at your service.
If our business is private I'll mention that General Schuyler is on the balcony.
Oh, not at all.
I've already mentioned to him.
That we wished to speak to you about the location of the capital.
You know the Resident's Bill must be voted on without delay.
I understand that an immediate decision is necessary.
I will not disguise from you ..
That I consider the geographical position of the capital ..
A very vital matter.
A very vital matter.
We know you will have great influence with the President.
In arriving at a decision.
That decision, gentlemen, is a very grave and serious matter.
But I think we should have no difficulty in reaching an agreement.
I am pleased to find you are willing to meet us in the matter.
I've gone into the matter very seriously.
And I've come to the conclusion.
That there is only one possible location for the capital.
That is?
─ Albany.
Oh.
I think I heard my father-in-law call.
Albany? That old Dutch town?
─ Why Albany?
Because it commands the commerce of the four corners of the earth.
I'm afraid you don't consider ..
─ I know.
Much may be said in favor of
New York and Philadelphia.
You talk as if Albany, New York and
Philadelphia were the only choices.
You have a place in mind?
Hasn't the South as much claim as the North?      ─ Certainly not, sir.
The South could not possibly be considered.
What's your reason for the North except you're a northerner yourself?
Why .. gentlemen.
All our country's great and glorious traditions ..
Cluster about the North.
It was here in Philadelphia ..
That was signed that immortal document from your hand, Mr Jefferson ..
The Declaration Of Independence.
─ What's that to do with it?
It was in New York that
Washington took his oath of office.
It was there that the government had its beginning.
And there is nothing, no reason on earth why the South should have it anyway.
The South will put up a fight for it.
─ Is that your final word, Mr Hamilton?
My decision on this matter ..
Is just as irrevocable as your decision regarding my Assumption Bill.
Excuse me. I am sure I heard the General calling.
Did you hear what he said?
Do you think it's a bait?
He means he'll support us if we back his Bill.
We can't do that .. it's against all our principles.
We've got to do it. We dare not let the capital go to the North.
The whole party will be against us.
Forgive me for leaving you.
Although I fear gentlemen, our interview is at an end.
But Mr Hamilton.
I've always found that in settling arguments.
It is necessary to give and take.
Precisely.
To give the least and take the most.
Now, in regard to the capital.
I have a proposal to make.
Won't you sit down?
Since we cannot agree upon the selection of a city.
Why not build us a new city?
Founded on the ideals of liberty and fraternity.
Why .. that's certainly an original idea.
A new city.
On the Hudson.
─ No, not on the Hudson.
On the Potomac.
Half way between the
North and the South.
I am sorry, Mr Jefferson.
But my decision is irrevocable.
I think you said.
As irrevocable as our decision about your Bill.
Did I?
I think I did.
Suppose we make a .. concession.
Strike a bargain, you mean?
Why .. I wouldn't care to use that word, Mr Hamilton.
No? Then we won't use it.
We'll call it a "concession".
Suppose we ..
Pass your Bill ..
In return for the capital?
Gentlemen.
This is really a surprising proposal.
I'm afraid I need time to think that over.
You're a quick thinker when you like.
─ Yes. When I like the proposal.
But it seems I get the worst of the bargain. Or "concession".
We offer you what you've fought for years.
Give me a week to think it over?
─ Impossible, Mr Hamilton.
Three days?
─ No.
This must be decided now. We've pledged our word to the Southern States.
You've pledged your word?
I was not aware of that.
In that case, gentlemen.
I shall feel compelled .. to agree.
─ Good.
Shall we put it in writing?
─ No. Our oral pledge is sufficient.
Your word is your bond.
In fact gentlemen, I would rather take your word ..
Than the bond of almost any State in the Union.
Good day, Mr Hamilton.
─ Good day, Mr Jefferson.
Senator.
Alexander .. aren't you a wizard!
No, General .. but I'm learning to be a politician.
Keep quiet there, will you.
I'm selling state securities for the price of the printing.
Sit down. How can you be selling when there are no buyers?
Ah .. you don't know the value of them.
Don't any of you gentlemen want to make some easy money?
Here is a $100 state security going to the highest bidder.
What State?
─ South Carolina.
I'm selling, I'm selling, I'm selling.
Where did you get all this paper, Reynolds?
Well, if ain't Senator ..
─ Shut your mouth.
Where did you get it from?
From the poor soldiers.
You're a bad egg, ain't you.
A good family, a good education.
But you're a yellow dog.
I've been unfortunate.
─ I know. You were found out.
Lots of people are unfortunate that way.
You ain't fond of
Alexander Hamilton, are you.
No, I ain't.
And you'd do any darned thing for a ten-dollar bill, wouldn't you?
Well just as long as it wasn't anything dishonorable, Mr Roberts.
If there was only a way to shake the people's faith in him.
Pretty hard to shake the people's faith in Hamilton.
I know it.
See, Mr Roberts.
Have you ever thought about ..?
Sit down.
Excuse me, Master Hamilton.
But it's right now ten o'clock.
Well, what of it?
Why, you ain't had no dinner and now you ain't touched no supper neither.
Well, I've got a difficult job on here.
Trying to make bricks without straw.
Bricks?
I certainly do see why you might want to miss supper, Master.
[ Door knocks ]
Is you in or is you out?
Oh well .. I suppose I'm in.
Yes, sir. You is in.
Monsieur Hamilton, he is still working?
─ He sure is, your honor.
Mr Count Talleyrand, sir.
Ah bonsoir, mon ami.
Monsieur Talleyrand.
This is indeed a pleasure.
If I say I am delighted to find you at all, I tell only half the truth.
Why, what is the mystery?
My dear friend, Hamilton.
All the time I am a visitor in your country.
When I am in trouble, I come to you for advice and you have never failed me.
Tonight, I come to give advice.
What have I been doing?
─ Too much.
Today I meet General Schuyler and he tells me he can do nothing with you.
I promise him I will call.
I come here at 10 o'clock.
And I find you are still working.
Now, I will drag you out on a little spree.
Why, Talleyrand, you surprise me.
We've always met on the gravest matters of state.
And now, in the midst of your own revolution in France.
You propose a little "spree".
─ Oui.
Zekial!
Glasses.
─ Yes sir, Mr Hamilton.
I'm going to give you a toast.
Don't you drink that on an empty stomach, Master Hamilton.
Or it will go straight to your head.
To George Washington.
The first American.
A great big heart.
A great big soul.
─ And a great big nose.
Ah, c'est bon, sir.
─ Now then.
Sit down.
No, no. No, Alexander.
No more work tonight.
Come with me. A little spree, eh?
What do you call a little spree?
A little spree.
Ah, your American girls.
So .. ravissante.
I know. I know Mrs Hamilton is charming, but she is away.
She is away so long and you are lonely.
Yes.
I am lonely.
─ A little spree.
You think I deserve it, eh?
─ We are all but human.
A little spree will do you good. Come .. come.
No, no, no.
No? I cannot tempt you?
─ I'm afraid you might.
That's why I say ..
Goodnight.
Merci.
─ Bonsoir.
What's the matter, Zekial?
─ A little spree.
I figured it ought to do you sort of good, sir.
Zekial!
Well, if I'd been working the same as you ..
I reckon I'd like a little spree myself.
You old reprobate! At your age?
Well sir, that am the only thing that would prevent it.
Get out! Go home and go to bed immediately.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[ Door knocks ]
What is it?
Is this Mr Alexander Hamilton's house?
Yes. What do you want?
─ I want to see him.
Won't it do tomorrow?
─ Oh no, I must see him tonight.
Well .. alright, wait a moment.
Come in.
Are you Alexander Hamilton?
Yes.
─ Oh.
It's very late isn't it.
Were you just going to bed?
I think I was.
Oh, then I ought not to have disturbed you.
It was mighty nice of you to let me in.
What do you want?
I want money.
Money?
Why have you come to me?
Why, I'm an American.
I thought it was the place of the
Secretary of the Treasury to help me.
But ..
My father was in the commissary department during the war.
Was he?
Won't you sit down?
Yes. Mr Lewis his name was.
Well ..
What do you want the money for?
To run away.
Run away?
Yes. From my husband.
Your husband?
But you are very young.
I am nearly thirty.
I don't look it, do I.
Oh .. he's been nothing to me for a long time but ..
Tonight he came to my lodgings where I've been living and ..
Struck me.
So I thought if you could give me the money ..
That tomorrow I would go to New York.
And tonight?
Oh, I can go back to my lodgings.
He won't come there again tonight.
What did you say your name was? Lewis?
No. That was my father's name.
Maria is my first name.
At home I was always called Joy.
Joy?
Yes.
But I haven't had much joy since I was married.
Oh, but I want it.
I want joy and happiness.
Things will look brighter tomorrow.
No .. I've waited for year for things to look brighter tomorrow.
I'm afraid you're very tired.
I am.
And I've had nothing since morning.
Haven't you?
Well.
Why, neither have I.
Nothing to eat since morning?
Why .. you poor thing.
Why, you've all sorts of things here.
─ Would you like something?
No thank you.
And wine.
─ Have a glass of wine.
Oh yes, I love wine.
Oh.
Oh but I don't think
I should have had it.
I've had nothing to eat.
In that case I believe it goes straight to the head.
Aren't you going to have one?
─ Yes, I'm going to have one.
Here is wishing that joy ..
May come back into your life.
Do you know what it is to be lonely?
I do.
I've been very lonely sometimes.
I believe you are lonely now.
Have you nobody here to talk to?
Nobody.
But you.
And that is why I am going to send you away.
But first of all, how much money do you need?
I'm afraid I ought not to have come to you.
Well, I want you to understand.
The Treasury doesn't give money to individuals.
I'm not a rich man but I'm very sorry for you.
And I'm going to let you have ..
Fifty dollars out of my own purse.
Oh, thank you.
But you must regard it as a personal loan.
It had nothing to do with the treasury.
You are certainly very good to me.
And now ..
Oh .. I see ..
You don't think it's right my being here.
Well ..
─ I'll go.
Have you far to go?
─ Oh no.
It's quite close. I ..
Why ..
I don't know what's come over me.
I feel so faint.
Have some water.
Drink this.
It must have been the wine.
Feel my face.
How it's burning.
But you're feeling better, aren't you?
─ Yes.
Yes.
Just let me stay a moment.
There.
Now I'll go.
You're very trusting.
Not always .. but I'm human.
I think I'd better see you to your door.
Oh, will you?
Chilly, isn't it.
─ Yes, the night air.
Here.
Put this round you.
Oh ..
One of yours?
Yes .. it's very big for you.
It's very cosy.
May I take your arm?
This is where I live.
On the second floor.
Goodbye.
─ Goodbye.
You're feeling much better, aren't you?
─ Oh yes.
I'll wait until you're safely in.
Thank you.
It is wonderful to have been with someone who was kind to me.
Goodnight.
─ Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Oh, I have your cloak.
You got in, Reynolds.
─ Yes, I managed it.
I look quite the gentleman, don't I.
There is Hamilton now.
Finishing his minuet.
Do your job.
Make him dance to another tune.
Molly, I feel like a bride tonight, with everyone giving me such attention.
I wish I could be what you would call .. the best man.
To have the honor of kissing the bride.
Mrs Bingham, your party is the success of the season.
But oh dear me.
I must give up these violent dances.
Father, you know you love to hold the ladies' hands.
If Lady Washington would do me the honor.
This is the first time that I have ever been to a dance without my husband.
I think I will not dance tonight, General.
The President would have been here ..
Alexander sent him away.
The President did me the honor to agree with me.
That the only way to put down the whiskey rebellion in Pennsylvania ..
Was to send a strong armed force.
And he knew that he was the only man to lead the troops.
Except Alexander Hamilton.
He has plenty of fighting to do in Philadelphia.
For me, I am on the side of the whiskey rebellion.
This is a free country.
Why tax the whiskey?
Mon dieu. It was that that started our revolution in France.
Viscount, you don't drink whiskey in France.
It isn't the whiskey, it's the mixing that caused the trouble.
Mixing? What did they mix with it?
Politics, ma'am.
Hello, Mr Hamilton.
Could I talk with you for a moment?
What is it? Why?
My name is Reynolds.
I used to be employed in the Treasury.
Oh yes, I remember.
I want you to take me back again, Mr Hamilton.
I have nothing to say to you.
I see Roberts is here.
─ He's avoiding us.
He evidently resents our supporting Hamilton.
Roberts resents everything except Roberts.
I must admit. Our going over to the Assumption Bill was awkward.
Our change of front will be difficult to explain to the people.
Tom Jefferson, you can explain away anything.
Give you a pen and ink, there isn't your equal for that in the universe.
Dear, can't we slip away?
I don't want all these people. I want you.
Well, as this is given in your honor.
I'm afraid we can't slip away.
We might make a grand exit.
We'll appeal to our hostess.
Oh Mrs Hamilton, do tell us about your adventures.
Going all the way to England.
We're going to steal her from you, Mr Hamilton.
Well, what do you want to know?
Tell us about your journey.
They say that our fast sailing ships are wonderful.
You just get on the boat in Philadelphia and whizz, in 6 weeks you're in London.
You'd better listen to me, Mr Hamilton.
What is it you want?
That's rather private.
This is a strange place to choose for a private conversation.
Maybe it is a strange matter
I have to talk about.
There is a quiet corner.
Well .. what is it?
I'm hard up, Mr Hamilton.
I've got to have money.
─ What's that to me?
I want you to give me back my old job in the Treasury.
You have been tried.
You are lazy. You are dishonest.
There's no place for you in any government office.
Maybe you'll find a place for me, and find it quick.
I think you're drunk.
─ Do you?
Do you remember a lady who called on you one night?
Quite late.
You took her home.
She told you her first name was Maria.
She didn't tell you her married name.
Her married name was
"Reynolds", Mr Hamilton.
"Reynolds"?
─ Yes. My wife.
You took advantage of her being alone.
I see.
You came into her life ..
─ What do mean, "came into her life"?
You know I've never seen her since.
─ But you sent her money. I can prove it.
Are you going to give me the job?
─ No!
Maybe you'll wish you had.
What do you mean to do?
Well first of all, I should consider it my duty to tell Mrs Hamilton.
How much do you want?
Well, I don't want to be hard on you, Mr Hamilton.
But if you give me a hundred dollars.
Here is my address.
I'll send it to you.
Would you excuse us, Molly?
I'm rather tired.
Why of course you are, my dear.
Alexander has disappeared.
I've looked everywhere for him.
Why Alexander, here you are.
Molly will excuse us.
Molly, I can't tell you the pleasure you've given us tonight.
You are leaving?
So soon?
Au revoir.
I sail tomorrow for France.
And when I get back to my country and its revolution I will say ..
In America, romance is not dead.
For there is Alexander Hamilton.
And there is his Betsy.
[ Singing: ]
Why Alexander. What is happening?
How did you manage to tear yourself away from work at this hour in the morning?
I heard you singing.
And I couldn't resist coming to see if you looked as pretty as you sounded.
Amiable .. play truant today.
Let's have this day together.
Take me shopping.
But who is to look after my shop, The Treasury?
Shut it up.
Let's pretend it's my birthday.
And I declare this a public holiday.
What are we to shop with?
─ I know money is scarce.
But we won't spend much.
Father says you've no right to go on working for the government.
Your grateful country pays you $3,500 a year as Secretary of the Treasury.
And you know you could earn
$20,000 a year in private practice.
Well, after tomorrow.
When my Assumption Bill goes through, we'll think about it.
But today.
It shall be your birthday and we'll shut up shop.
You're a darling.
Alexander.
There is Roberts and Monroe, both come to see you.
I met them on the doorstep and I put them in your study.
Now, isn't that devilish?
What do you think they want?
I'm afraid that's just what I must find out.
Well I give you ten minutes, no longer.
Ten minutes.
Come along father-in-law.
Help me to get rid of them.
Gentlemen, you honor me.
Why, General Schuyler was just congratulating me on your cooperation ..
In connection with my Assumption Bill.
Yes.
I trust we shall have no reason to alter our decision on that point.
I too trust you will not find it expedient to break your word.
It isn't a matter of breaking words, it's a matter of public opinion.
I was not alluding to you,
Senator Roberts.
Everybody knows that you would never be guilty of a breach of faith.
Unless it were made  absolutely worth your while.
That remark was uncalled for, sir.
True. Tell me Senator, what have you called for?
We have called, Mr Hamilton on business of a private character.
Mr Jefferson, sir.
You must excuse me Mr Hamilton, but ..
I received a note from Senator Monroe.
Asking me to meet him here at this hour.
I trust I do not intrude.
I told Mr Jefferson the business was urgent.
Otherwise, I should not have taken the liberty.
Gentlemen, pray be seated.
Oh.
We have recently been annoyed by the receipt ..
Of anonymous letters.
Threatening exposure of some scandal concerning the Secretary of the Treasury.
We have traced these letters to a man named .. Reynolds.
Oh yes.
James Reynolds.
You know him?
Yes.
This man has placed in my hands certain papers.
Which show that he has received from you considerable sums of money.
What was that money paid for?
May I be allowed to see the documents in question?
There's no doubt you paid him the money.
There seems to be no doubt about that.
We are compelled to ask you why you paid.
Who compelled you to do that?
─ Our sense of duty.
Duty to whom?
─ To the country. To the people.
It's not to do with the country or the people.
This is my own private affair.
We know why you paid him the money.
Reynolds told us.
─ Oh, you know, do you?
Then you haven't come for information.
But merely for the love of sport.
We've got Reynolds' sworn statement.
That you paid him the money to buy State's certificates at a few cents on the dollar.
While you hoodwink us into passing your Bill.
Which would compel the government to pay you a hundred cents on the dollar.
So.
That's what he told you, did he?
That's the reason for the whole thing.
Senator Roberts, remember you've only Reynolds' word for this.
Gentlemen, let's try to be frank with one another.
You have come here today.
Not because you believe me guilty of this accusation.
But because you repent the bargain you made with me to vote for my Bill.
You're afraid of your own party.
Your courage has failed you.
You see this as a tremendous opportunity to free yourselves from your promise.
That is the true statement of facts, Mr Jefferson.
Whatever you may think to the contrary.
You dislike me. You are afraid of me.
And this is part of an organised conspiracy to force me to resign.
Time and again you're charged me with dishonesty in The Treasury.
And time and again I've proved ..
That there was no shadow of foundation to your accusation.
And you've slunk away, whipped and defeated.
And now here you are!
Yelping at my heels again.
And ready to tear me to pieces.
Had I desired to defraud The Treasury.
Should I have been driven to the need of un-kennelling Reynolds to assist me?
If I thought that you really believed this story.
I should not hesitate to give you proof of its falsity.
But you know .. that what you accuse me of ..
Has no foundation in truth.
I admit.
That I had transactions.
With that man Reynolds.
But they were of a private nature.
And I swear that my connection with him ..
Is in no way bound up with my public office.
I make an appeal.
To your sense of justice.
And I ask you gentlemen.
To drop this investigation.
If our accusation is false.
Why not tell us the facts?
Because they would be of no value to you.
And would cause great suffering ..
To some who are very dear to me.
You mean .. it's a domestic affair?
In a sense, yes.
Something .. that affects your wife?
Yes, sir. Something that affects my wife.
In that case ..
─ Mr Hamilton.
As a trusted representative of the people ..
I feel it my duty to ask you a few questions.
Yes?
Well, in the first place ..
In what way is your wife mixed up with ..?                     ─ Stop!
There'll be no more of this.
I am ashamed of the act that has led to this inquiry.
But I am more ashamed of my cowardice in begging for your charity.
You shall have the facts.
During the absence of my wife abroad.
I became intimate with Mrs Reynolds.
It doesn't matter how or where.
Since that night I have been repeatedly blackmailed by that man, Reynolds.
Alexander!
─ I have no excuse to make.
But it is now clear to me.
That this whole thing was engineered by certain political opponents.
A plot to discredit
Washington's administration.
And my office.
Excuse me gentlemen, but this is my birthday.
And I've come to claim my husband.
In a few moments, dear.
In a few moments, I'll come.
I don't think we need ask
Mrs Hamilton to withdraw.
Our business is over.
Is anything the matter, father?
─ It's alright, my girl. It's alright.
I deeply regret you should have been subjected to this.
I give you my word that not one syllable shall ever pass my lips.
I'm sorry. I was misinformed.
I apologise.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I'm not satisfied with this.
I won't be muzzled.
You must excuse me.
But I cannot stand by as Senator Roberts maintains this offensive attitude.
And I wish to express my regret.
That a representative of the Senate.
Should behave in such a deplorable fashion.
I take my leave.
Well, Jefferson's words don't alter facts.
Not with me they don't.
Your Bill is coming up tomorrow, ain't it?
Now what would you say if the newspapers came out in the morning ..
With the story that the
Secretary of the Treasury ..
Was playing crooked with the nation's money.
Is there any danger of the papers getting it?
There is more than a danger.
The Advertizer has got the story now.
And is going to publish it tomorrow unless ..                      ─ Unless?
Well, unless you deny it.
Which you couldn't very well.
Because there are the proofs that you paid the money to Reynolds.
And you can't explain why.
You've got me, haven't you.
Now, Mr Hamilton.
I you will withdraw your Assumption Bill ..
I'll guarantee that the story will not be printed.
Alexander, I don't know or care about this false charge brought against you.
But you've worked for that Bill for eight years.
No-one knows as well as
I how hard he has worked.
And you must not withdraw it.
Well, the Bill is killed, either way.
If this story of your being mixed up with this woman comes out ..
Ah well, I'm sorry. I ..
Well, what's the good of mincing matters?
Alexander.
Is it true?
Betsy.
Does anyone else .. know?
No.
Then it need never .. be known.
Then you withdraw your Bill?
No! No, I can't do it.
I've done with bargains. I've bargained with my conscience for long enough.
But I can't stand in the mud and barter America's honor.
My Bill stands!
Get out and tell your story.
And I'll tell mine.
What will you tell?
─ The truth.
The whole degrading, sordid truth.
In tomorrow's newspaper, I'll publish every fragment of evidence.
In connection with my disgrace with this woman.
If there is to be dishonor, it shall fall on me.
And not on this administration.
I'll sacrifice my name.
I'll sacrifice my home.
But by God, Betsy,
I cannot sell my country.
"Latest sensation!"
"Secretary of the Treasury confesses scandal!"
"Latest sensation!"
"Secretary of the Treasury confesses scandal!"
Hamilton?
Well.
Who'd have thought Hamilton would have got mixed up in a thing like that.
Gentlemen, I'd hate to be in his shoes.
─ So would I.
It don't make sense.
"Secretary of the Treasury confesses scandal!"
"Latest sensation!"
"Secretary of the Treasury confesses scandal!"
For remembrance.
Betsy.
He's almost packed and ready to go.
It's good of you.
To come to tell me goodbye.
But I didn't come to tell you goodbye.
You didn't really care for her, did you?
No ..
[ Door knocks ]
Yes?
Mr Jefferson and Senator
Monroe want to see you, sir.
Mr Maurice and Mr Gerald, and a lot of other gentlemen.
Alright, I'll come.
My friends.
My friends of yesterday.
They've come to tell me.
That my Bill.
Has failed.
Oh, my dear.
Betsy.
Wait for me here.
No.
Let me stand by you.
Hmm.
Gentlemen.
I am at your service.
Colonel Hamilton.
You see before you men of your own party.
As well as your political opponents.
They have asked me to speak for them.
Now, Mr Jefferson.
Let me spare you that painful duty.
I know why you are here.
You have come in advance of
President Washington's orders.
To relieve me of my office.
And to tell me .. that my
Bill has been defeated.
I must accept the verdict.
Colonel Hamilton.
I have been asked to tell you that every man in this room.
Every man in the cabinet.
Every man in the Senate.
[ Trumpet fanfare! ]
[ Trumpet fanfare! ]
I have the honor to announce the
President Of The United States.
Colonel Hamilton.
I have come to express my confidence in your integrity.
You have upheld the honor of the Secretary of the Treasury.
At the expense of
Alexander Hamilton the man.
By your courageous action you have swung all parties to your support.
Your Bill has been passed by an overwhelming vote.
Oh my dear ..
President Washington.
I am deeply moved.
By this expression of your confidence.
And by the generosity of these gentlemen.
In their judgemeñt of me.
But the passage of my Bill.
Has stirred within me a still deeper feeling.
The defeat .. or the victory ..
Of Alexander Hamilton the man.
Is of small value çompared ..
With the honor of this great nation.
By the pässing of this Bill ..
You have established the credit of the United States.
You have opened the floodgates of prosperity.
A prosperity that will reach far beyond our present vision.
A prosperity ..
That will one day make America.
The most powerful nation in the world.
T-G ö
How often do I have to tell you... that Sophia Frederica is no longer to play with toys.
She's almost seven now.
Don't smoke in here. The child is sick.
I work day and night to arrange an advantageous marriage someday, and you undo everything.
How am I to make it clear to you that
Sophia might one day become a queen?
I don't want to be a queen, Mother.
I want to be a toe dancer.
Be quiet, Sophia. You're going to marry a king if I have anything to do with it.
Stick out your tongue,
Your Highness, and say "ahh. "
Ahh.
Not as bad as I thought.
We'll build her a nice harness, and she'll have to wear it for about a year.
Put those toys away.
I don't want to see them again!
You'll grow up to be a tall and beautiful woman.
I must be off on one of my operations.
Don't let them frighten you, darling.
"A nice harness"!
What is he, a horse doctor?
You flatter him. Our learned medico is going to perform one of his operations with an axe.
- He's the public hangman.
- Hangman?
What's a hangman?
Can I become a hangman someday?
A hangman is an executioner, the man who takes heads off skillfully.
Sometimes that profession becomes the sport of titles.
I was about to read to you... of Peter the Great and Ivan the Terrible, and other Russian tsars and tsarinas who were hangmen.
Stop walking, August.
You make me nervous.
Your Highness! Your Highness!
Your Highness!
Your Highness, a letter from the king.
Your father wishes to see you at once.
Sit down, my child.
We have been honored with a communication from His Majesty... which concerns you principally.
"We, by Divine Grace Frederick, king of Prussia,
"have, after a series of negotiations,
"decided to honor your family by selecting your daughter,
"Sophia Frederica to forthwith set out for Russia...
"and there to become the bride of
His Serene Highness, Peter Feodorovich,
"grandson of Peter the Great, nephew of Her Imperial Majesty,
"and heir presumptive to the throne.
"Within the week, an emissary will arrive...
"to escort your daughter and her mother,
"Princess Johanna Elizabeth, to the court at Moscow.
" Please inform her that she is to follow dutifully...
"the advice of
Her Majesty's ambassador...
"and extend to her, as well as to your entire family, my fond greetings and affections.
Fredericus Rex. "
Grand duchess of Russia!
Not bad for this family.
I wonder what he looks like.
That unimportant detail can be settled when the ambassador gets here.
Come, August, we shall reply to the king at once.
One must strike while the iron's hot.
Come with me.
This is the countess Cecilia, a cousin on my mother's side. and this is her sister, Maria, and this-
Your Highness may now come down.
This is Count Alexei, field marshal of the Russian Army, grand master of the hunt, lord of the chamber and ambassador extraordinary... from Her Divine Majesty,
Elizabeth of Russia.
This is my daughter Sophia.
Although for a long time we've heard about your beauty, Your Highness,
I must confess, I was not prepared to see such a vision of loveliness.
Her Majesty instructed me to present a few gifts as evidence of her graciousness.
Come here.
This pipe is for you,
Prince August.
These sables are to keep your shoulders warm.
These gloves are to keep your hands warm.
This robe is to keep your feet warm.
These hot-water bottles, to keep Mother warm.
Is it then still so cold in Russia, Your Excellency?
Indeed, Your Highness, the rivers are still frozen, and will be until some time after we've arrived.
Her Majesty also asked me to give you this token of her esteem.
Convey to her my profoundest thanks.
Isn't Her Majesty beautiful!
How long will the journey take?
If weather permits, we should reach Moscow in seven weeks, where Her Majesty is impatiently awaiting us.
And when does Your Excellency require the journey be begun?
The day after tomorrow, unless it is the desire of this charming young lady... to leave at once to meet her anxious bridegroom.
- Did you bring me a portrait of the grand duke?
- I'm sorry, I did not.
- Would you like him to be handsome?
- Isn't he?
Would you like him to be better looking than all men, tall and gracious?
- Yes, I think I would.
- Well, he is all that and more.
He's the handsomest man in the Russian court, tall and formed like a Greek god, a model in fashion and deportment which all of us strive to follow.
- Are you eager to see him?
- Yes.
His eyes are like the blue sky, his hair the color of ebony.
He is stronger than a team of oxen, and sleepless because of his desire to receive you in his arms.
And he can also read and write.
So can my daughter. She can cook and sew and make her own bed if she has to.
- Can't you, Sophia?
- But I don't like to make my own bed, Mother.
- Don't speak unless you're questioned.
- You did question me, Mother.
Say good night, and go back to your room and go to sleep.
Good night, Father.
Good night, Sophia.
Good night, Your Excellency.
Good night, my little princess.
- Good night, Mother.
- Good night.
- Good night, Auntie.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
This is unexpected.
Your daughter is extremely charming... and will be by far the most beautiful woman at Her Majesty's court.
I'd be grateful if you were not to turn her head.
She's been brought up carefully, is unspoilt, and I've taught her not to flirt.
You're going on a far journey, and I may never see you again.
Remember what I've taught you.
Always to be honest and truthful; to be a faithful wife and a loyal subject of your new country.
Be kind to those who are in your service... and obedient to your husband and superiors, and strive at all times to be worthy of your glorious destiny.
Another day like this, and I'll fall apart.
When I return, I'll complain to the king about the state of his roads.
The roads are bad, aren't they?
When we reach the border, there will be snow and we shall change to sleds.
Your rooms are ready, Your Royal
Highness. Can I show them to you?
Yes, you may.
I'm prepared for the worst.
Is the journey proving too much for you too?
Oh, no.
It could go on forever... if Mother didn't mind.
Be careful with that knife.
You'll cut your beautiful hand.
Your hand is beautiful, isn't it?
- Why did you do that?
- Because I've fallen in love with you.
Now you may punish me for my effrontery.
I deserve punishment far more than you do.
We must never do this again.
It's disloyal to my future husband.
Disloyal? It's treason, and I must be careful in the future, but you must help me by not exciting me with your beautiful eyes.
I told you not to look at me.
What are you two doing?
Don't answer me. I don't want to know.
Sophia,you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
You will instantly follow me to our rooms.
Incidentally, our rooms are beneath all contempt, Your Excellency.
The stables are probably better than the quarters assigned to us.
I'm sorry, Your Highness.
If you prefer the stables,
I can arrange to have the horses quartered in your bedroom.
Barbarian!
You're going to sleep in my room tonight.
It is cold. At least you have something to warm you when you get to Moscow;
That is, if your husband isn't completely made of ice.
A basket of fruit with Her Majesty's compliments, and these flowers from the grand duke, who instructed me to ride day and night for a week to be here in time.
Welcome home, Your Excellency.
We've missed you.
So, this is Little Sophie,
Sophia Frederica.
Hardly a name for a future empress.
- You don't like your name, do you?
- I do, Your Majesty.
You will be called Catherine Alexina, a good Russian name.
We've arranged a special ceremony to receive you into our church.
- Haven't we, Simeon?
- Yes, little mother, we've arranged a ceremony.
Come here.
So, this is the mother.
You've raised a pretty child.
Your Majesty, I've come to lay at your feet feelings of the deepest gratitude... for the benefactions which your bounty has heaped upon my house, and of which many instances are given me at every step I take into your realms.
Tush, tush! Apretty speech.
What I have done is nothing in comparison with what I shall do.
- My own blood is no more dear to me than yours.
- Is that the grand duke?
Shh.
This is the order of St. Catherine.
May you both wear it in good health.
Be careful it doesn't scratch you.
Pin this on Catherine.
What do you think of Catherine?
I can only admire your judgment, Your Majesty.
That's the chancellor. Steals more money in a week than I collect in taxes in a year.
Doctor, come here.
What do you think of my taste in women?
Looks healthy, doesn't she?
Just what we need to breed sons for Russia.
With your permission,
Your Highness.
- How was the journey? Comfortable?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Are you happy to be here?
Yes, Your Majesty.
- Are you going to love your new country?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Do you promise to be a loyal subject?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Don't make too many new friends, and no intrigue and gossip. I have my hands full now.
Perfect, Your Majesty.
She will give us no trouble.
Your Highness.
Someday I'll have every doctor thrown out of the country.
Catherine, before you go to your rooms, is there any wish I can grant you?
I would like to see the grand duke.
His Imperial Highness,
Grand Duke Peter.
That's a fine way to receive your bride!
I suppose you had more important things to do.
I told you to be on time.
Go on, kiss each other.
Remember, Catherine, the first child must be a boy.
A fine, bouncing, healthy heir.
You understand me, Catherine?
These are your ladies-in-waiting.
They represent illustrious houses of our most important domains.
Step forward, Natacha.
She is the daughter of Prince Dolgoruki.
Natacha, come here.
This is your mistress of the wardrobe.
She has charge of the beds and laces.
I must show her my new invention.
I'm in a hurry.
I must witness an execution.
I suggest that you wait in the next room.
Perhaps I shouldn't have lied to you.
Forgive me, won't you?
His Imperial Highness sent me for his soldiers.
I hope I haven't disturbed you.
That's Countess Varonsoff. She's always picking up the grand duke's soldiers, which I'm beginning to suspect he leaves intentionally.
Don't bother. Don't bother.
Go on with your work.
Doesn't Sophia, I mean, Catherine, look beautiful? I always forget the new name.
Just see what's being done to her hair!
That's exactly what
I'm looking at.
How's she going to wear the headdress?
Where is the headdress?
- Where is the headdress?
- Where's the headdress?
We must make you very beautiful,
Catherine, very, very beautiful... so that my nephew will fall in love with you.
I expect you two to behave like love birds so Russia will have an heir to the throne.
Remember, I want a boy, not a girl.
Nothing less than a boy will do.
We don't want any more women on the throne.
But Your Majesty, what would we have done if you had been born a boy?
I would have had less trouble in Russia if I'd been born a man instead of woman.
We women are too much creatures of the heart, aren't we, Catherine?
Yes, Your Majesty.
"Grant them of the fruit of their bodies fair children,
"concord of soul and body.
"exalt them like the cedars of Lebanon.
"like a luxuriant vine, give them seed in number like full ears of grain...
"that they may abound in every work that is good and acceptable unto Thee;
"and let them behold their children's children like a newly planted olive orchard,
"round about their table that obtaining favor in Thy sight, they may shine like the stars of heaven. "
Blessed be this bed.
Your Imperial Majesty, before the bridal pair retire,
I wish to propose a toast... to Her Imperial Highness, the grand duchess Catherine.
May our new bride from far away be forever happy... and learn to know the love we have in our Russian hearts for her... and the hope this vast, imperishable empire has... for an heir to the throne.
You have made me very happy today, Catherine, and i hope you will continue to make me happy.
Now, I'm going to bed.
I'm very tired.
And I know that most of you... are are also very tired.
May I inquire how Her Imperial Highness deigns to feel this morning?
Her Highness feels as well as can be expected... after her romantic marriage.
And how is His Excellency?
His Excellency is distressed because you've been avoiding him for an eternity.
- I haven't been avoiding you.
- You have.
I've tried again and again to see you alone...
- and you've made it impossible.
- If you must know,
I haven't had enough time to recover from the shock... of finding my husband a trifle different than you described him.
I had a duty to my country and a loyalty to my sovereign.
Had I described the grand duke correctly, you might not have come here.
I would have obeyed my mother even if you had told the truth.
How could I have known of such a degree of filial respect?
Anyway, I would have taken no chances, because from the moment I saw you,
- I wanted you to come to Russia.
- Please, be careful.
- My husband will be told.
- Your husband doesn't mean a thing to you.
He does. I'll always be faithful to him.
Those ideas are old-fashioned.
This is the eighteenth century.
But I'm not a Russian.
I'm going now.
I told you I wanted to see you alone.
I won't wait any longer.
I'll be at the stables tomorrow when you go for your ride.
Maybe I won't care to ride anymore.
- I'll be there, and you'd better be there too.
- I will not!
Furthermore, I'm going to tell my mother all about you.
One moment more,
Your Imperial Highness.
On the reverse side of this miniature is a diamond. Don't lose the diamond.
What are you doing here sneaking around like a ghost?
- I hate my wife.
- You hate your wife?
You've only been married for a week. Why?
You'll make a fine emperor someday, you idiot!
You can't force a woman to be sweet to you. She's only a child!
Be patient with her. You know our people are waiting for you to raise a family.
- They don't care whether you like her.
- I don't want her.
I picked her for your wife, and your wife she will remain as long as I live.
Get that into your skull.
I don't want to hear any more about it.
Do you understand me?
Her Majesty is waiting for you in the council chamber.
- War with Finland?
- Yes, Your Excellency.
- How is Her Majesty?
- The last few days she's turned sour, like milk that's been standing too long.
Your Highness is so happy this morning.
- You can't be going to see your husband.
- Dear me, my husband!
I'd forgotten I have a husband.
No, I'm not going to see my husband.
If Your Highness were not so new to our court,
I'd suspect you were going to see your lover.
Lover?
And what may a lover be?
A lover's a man, not a husband, who loves you with all his heart and whom you love in return.
But, Marie, that's wicked.
Don't tell me that you have a lover!
I wish I had. Here, everyone has a lover, everyone but me.
Oh, Marie, not everyone. Her Exalted
Majesty can't possibly have a lover.
What about the young man who's always with her?
Why do you suppose she leans on him so heavily? Because she's weak in the knees?
Oh, how shocking! If anyone should hear us! Go on, get my dress.
Your highness won't tell anyone.
The empress is a devil when she's angry.
Of course I won't tell anyone, nor do I believe such nonsense.
Neither have I a lover. I'm happy because I'm going to see my mother.
- Your mother? I thought you knew.
- Knew what?
Your mother left for Germany.
Her carriage set out at midnight.
- You must be joking.
- I'm not joking.
Her Majesty ordered her to return immediately.
But she didn't say good-bye.
That's not possible.
Her Majesty's in council.
No one's allowed to enter.
No order in this palace is intended for me.
Why did you send my mother away?
What wrong had she done?
I don't remember sending for you.
I want to know why you sent my mother away.
You presume to question me?
Who do you think you are, bursting into a conference as though the palace were on fire?
You want to know why
I sent your mother away.
Well, I'll tell you why.
I sent your mother away because she didn't bring you up properly.
I was told you were an obedient, respectful child.
You're nothing of the sort!
Why do you think I had you brought from
Germany? To give you these pearls?
Or to make you a grand duchess of the Holy Russian Empire?
I had you brought here to be an obedient wife... and to supply my country with a much-needed heir to the throne.
Take Her Imperial Highness, the grand duchess, and turn her over to my mistress of the robes... with instructions that from this minute on she's to be attached to my personal staff... where I can keep her under my eye, where I can educate her and teach her... what it means to be a Russian wife and how to accept the embraces of a husband... like a Russian wife!
Now, get out, both of you.
I have a war on my hands.
Looking for someone?
Oh, you frightened me.
I've only a minute. I ran away.
I came down to tell you not to wait. I must go now.
Is that all you came to tell me?
What else is there to tell?
If you come closer,
I'll scream.
It will be easier for you to scream without a straw in your mouth.
Get up! Get up!
Why are there six places?
What's the occasion?
You asked me to arrange a dinner for the French and Austrian ambassadors and their wives.
Tell them to come for breakfast.
I never did like these diplomatic functions.
- They lead to nothing.
- I quite agree, Your Majesty.
Don't any of you think I'm going to eat with a lot of dried-up mummies every night.
Boris, sit down there.
Alexander, sit over there.
You, sit there.
Michael!
- Your Majesty.
- Catherine.
Take his toys.
Michael, sit there.
Paul!
- Your Majesty.
- Oh, go on. Sit down.
Now, the rest of you get out.
Get out! Get out!
The pig, Your Majesty.
Put it down and don't make so much fuss about it.
The way you handle that pig, you'd think it was the only one in Russia.
- The wine, Your Majesty.
- Fill the glasses and get out.
What are you pouting for?
You're not jealous of Paul, are you?
He isn't jealous of you. You look exhausted, Paul. What's the matter?
I'm tired. My wife gave birth to a child yesterday.
- Boy or girl?
- A boy, beloved empress.
What the wife of a guard can do should certainly be easy for a grand duchess.
Remind me to give you a purse of gold tomorrow. Those of you who have boys, raise your hands.
Exactly what I thought!
A few more like you, and Russia need never worry about her enemies.
What's this, Alexei?
Sending notes to the grand duchess?
Do you want me to send you into exile?
Or shall I tell the grand duchess that you're a notorious heartbreaker... and have broken every woman's heart in this court, including mine?
You're very flattering, Imperial Majesty, but the note contains nothing of importance.
Then suppose you read it.
"We are all very much disturbed over your conduct... and wish you would change your behavior so that Her Majesty might forgive you. "
Who else can read here?
You read it, Catherine.
I know you can read... because my reports say you foolishly spend your time in bed reading books!
"We are all very much upset at, uh, uh -
"at- and hope... you will behave better... so that you may be forgiven by the empress. "
Send for the chancellor!
- Your Imperial Majesty?
- Read this for me.
"You must help me to see you alone again.
"You are being watched so closely that all my efforts to meet you... for a few precious seconds are in vain. "
So, you're up to your old tricks again!
Right under my nose too.
Well, forget about her. she's reserved for my nephew and being taught how to earn his love first... before wasting her favors on others.
Go back to your dinner. It's the first time you've been of use to me in a year.
As for you, look after my friends and see that they're fed well.
Did you hear what I said?
Sit down,you fools, or I'll send you to Siberia.
She may be a grand duchess to the rest of the world, but in here she's being taught how to be a Russian wife!
Catherine, where are you?
Take off my boots!
Go outside and send the others away.
Everybody!
I want to be alone tonight.
Her Majesty wishes to be alone tonight.
You wouldn't think that once
I had skin like velvet.
Empress, bah! I haven't even the power to iron out a single wrinkle.
What are you looking at?
That must be Peter.
Go see if it is, and tell him to come here at once.
Your Imperial Highness,
Her Majesty wishes to see you at once.
What the devil do you mean poking holes in my bedroom?
I wanted to watch my wife.
Watching your wife won't give you an heir to the throne.
The next time I catch you providing my rooms with needless ventilation,
I'll have you flogged.
I'll catch my death of a draft someday!
Go back to your rooms and wait for your wife.
This is your fault. I had hoped by bringing you to Russia to make a man of that half-wit!
Sorry to intrude, Your Majesty.
I think the grand duke dropped one of his soldiers in here.
Thank you.
Good night.
Wait a minute.
Come here.
How long have you been at this court picking up soldiers?
Two years and a half,
Your Majesty.
I fail to recall your exact duties here,
Countess Elizabeth.
I'm in charge of entertainment for
His Imperial Highness, the grand duke.
Exactly how far is it to your home, Lizzie?
My ancestral home is in the province of Astrakhan, about two weeks journey from Moscow.
Not as far as I had hoped. His Imperial Highness has been entertained long enough.
Do you understand me? I don't want to see you around again. Get out.
She won't snoop around here anymore.
I should have thrown her out before I had you brought here.
Come here, Catherine.
Sit down.
Haven't you given me trouble enough?
Are you going to behave like an obedient wife... or must I continue to treat you like a stubborn child?
I don't care what you do with me.
You might change your mind about that.
You're in love with His Excellency,
Count Alexei, aren't you?
No, Your Majesty, I'm not.
I'm not.
It's a good thing you're not.
I wouldn't advise you to become my rival.
Rival? What does
Your Majesty mean?
You will find out soon. In the meantime, you can blow out the candles.
Before you retire... you can be of one more service.
Behind my mirror, a concealed passage will lead you down... a flight of stairs to another door. behind that door you will find someone waiting to come up.
I don't want him to see you, so be careful.
- Good night, Your Majesty.
- Good night, Catherine.
And you don't need to report for duty until late tomorrow.
Halt!
Who goes there?
- Nobody.
- Just a minute, my little hen.
That's not the password.
You'd better think up another one.
Come to the guardhouse, and we'll find out who you are.
You're entirely too good-looking to be running around like this.
What are you hiding back there?
Take your hands off me, you insolent fool!
I'm Catherine, grand duchess of Russia.
Don't take advantage of me.
This is my first night on duty.
The grand duchess isn't permitted out at night. Tell me who you are.
I told you who I am.
Oh, come now.
Stop joking.
If you're the grand duchess, then I'm the grand duke.
I wish you were! if i were the grand duke and you were the grand duchess,
I wouldn't let you prowl through the night like this, like a pretty little kitten.
Suppose I didn't want to tell you who I really am. What would happen?
On a night like this, anything might happen... if I'm fortunate.
Well, Lieutenant, you are fortunate, very... fortunate.
It's ringing!
Three volleys.
It's a boy!
Have you noticed, Your Majesty, how the imperial duckling resembles his father?
Hush, hush, enough of this.
Now,you keep an eye on him.
I don't want anyone near him unless
I know about it, not even his mother.
I had enough trouble getting him.
If he catches cold or sniffles just once,
I'll have you hung by the ears!
If he coughs,
I'll have you cut in half!
And if anyone touches him,
I'll have you shot!
Your Majesty, I beg of you not to become excited.
You've been ill for weeks.
This turmoil will weaken you.
Don't any of you think I'll give you the pleasure of seeing me die!
I'll outlive all of you, you sinister buzzards. All of you!
- We've been glad with rejoicing.
- Your Imperial Highness!
I suppose you, too, want to congratulate me... as the father of the heir to the throne of Russia.
That was my intention,
Your Imperial Highness.
And I bring you the felicitations of my nation... and my own personal congratulations on so glorious an event.
Yes, I know.
Tell me about it some other time.
I want to be alone, do you hear?
Get out, all of you!
I'm crammed up to my neck with congratulations!
Get out! And if you must congratulate someone, congratulate my wife!
May I speak with Her Highness?
Shh.
The empress joins her people in congratulating Your Highness... on the birth of a male heir to the throne of Russia.
We all hope you will recover quickly... so you may wear this jewel, which Her Majesty is pleased to present to you as a sign... of her most extraordinary joy and satisfaction.
Sit down, ladies.
Sit down.
Your Excellency, what can I do for you?
Will you please ask
Her Highness once more...
- if she will grant me an audience?
- I'm sorry, Your Excellency, we have orders from Her Highness not even to mention your name to her.
Then perhaps you will convey to Her Highness... that I've been waiting for some time now to congratulate her... on the great historic event of providing our country with a much-needed heir to the throne.
I'm certain that history was far from her mind at the time, Your Excellency.
Her Majesty is very ill, and her days are numbered.
Soon she will be no more, poor soul, and another maniac will become our emperor.
It will be a bad day for Russia, and for me if I live that long.
Why are you telling this to me?
You know that the grand duke isn't exactly pleased with the present state of affairs.
State of affairs?
What affairs? I haven't had an affair for some time.
I know that the grand duke plans to remove you from court... or worse, as soon as he is in power.
You need have no fear for me.
Now that I've learned how
Russia expects me to behave,
I like it here.
And I intend to stay... grand duke or no grand duke!
We all hope you will stay, and I for one, at the risk of my neck, would like to help you.
How could you be of help?
I control enough of the political machine to carry some weight in a crisis.
I have no wish to share in any petty conspiracy.
Should it become unavoidable,
I think I have weapons... that are far more powerful than any political machine.
I'm afraid you don't know Russians, my child.
That's possible, father,
But i'm taking lessons as fast as I can.
Right here, gentlemen.
What a lovely target.
You're looking quite well,
Catherine, since you provided me with an unexpected addition to the family.
Thank you, Peter.
It's nice to see you again.
Come to think of it,
I'd like you to meet someone... who's come for an extended visit.
What are you doing here?
Back to the barracks!
Get out!
Come along, Catherine.
What do you think of this decapitation?
It would be more amusing if it were real.
Where's your visitor?
Oh, it's Lizzie.
Is she in charge of your entertainment again? What will Her Majesty say?
Her Majesty doesn't know anything about it, and I wouldn't advise you to tell her.
I wouldn't dream of telling the empress.
She has her own system of spies.
Not for the world would I interfere with your pleasures, as long as you don't interfere with mine.
How is Astrakhan, Lizzie?
Or was it Afghanistan?
If you're wise, you'll find out for yourself before it's too late!
There are comfortable convents along the way.
All you have to do to gain admission... is shave your head.
It's good for the scalp, anyway!
Entirely too many men love my hair, and I have no intention of changing my residence.
Anyway, this country will soon need a new empress.
You may as well know...
Peter's going to marry me when the old bat dies... and as soon as he gets rid of his present wife!
There you are, you old crow.
Dead as a doornail at last.
What have you got to say about it?
Open your mouth if you can.
In another week, it'll be full of ice.
In another month, not a soul will mourn for you.
In another year, you'll be forgotten.
Where is all your power?
It's mine now!
Do you hear me?
Take it away from me if you can!
It's my turn now!
- Who is this officer?
- Orloff, Your Majesty,
Captain in charge of the barracks.
Your Majesty, your visit here is the greatest honor in my life.
I've heard a good deal about you, Captain, from the ladies.
I didn't expect to see you here,
Your Excellency.
Why not, Your Majesty?
This is my pet regiment.
You look ravishing.
Now, there's another good-looking soldier.
Come here, Lieutenant.
What's your name?
Dmitri, Your Majesty.
And your duties, Dmitri?
In charge of the night watch,
Your Majesty.
It must be cold at night... sometimes.
Sometimes, Your Majesty.
Anyway, I'm certain you're very efficient, Lieutenant.
Is he, Captain?
Tell me something about him.
He's very efficient,
Your Majesty.
He joined our regiment from the Swedish front, where he fought bravely for about two years.
He's also distinguished himself by exemplary bravery on the Turkish border.
This should have been brought to our attention.
I can't understand why such a brave man hasn't been decorated.
His Excellency doesn't mind.
Not if Her Majesty will tell me why she continues to avoid me.
Her Majesty will tell you tonight... if you will call on her.
With pleasure, Your Majesty.
For bravery in action.
See that you do justice to it in future emergencies.
And now, Captain, tell me something about yourself.
Your Majesty, I'm distressed at my neglect at not having rewarded Lt. Dmitri before.
With your permission,
Your Majesty.
Rich too, huh?
Her Majesty will see you now,
Your Excellency.
At last, Your Majesty,
I've achieved... the enviable privilege of entering these rooms.
I seem to have a faint recollection that you had that privilege before.
Not since the days of Her Late Majesty, whom I often visited in the capacity of a trusted advisor.
Tell the others I've retired.
Send them away, and come back in here.
Her Majesty wishes to be alone tonight.
You may retire.
Tell me, Alexei, are you still fond of me?
Yes, Your Majesty,
I love you.
But I'm completely bewildered by your attitude towards me.
However, I've become accustomed to regard you... as one of those extraordinary women... who create their own laws and logic. and now I'm concerned only with your safety.
Is it my safety that concerns you... or the safety of an empress?
I would give my life if the woman I adore were not so far removed from me in station.
The woman you adore is quite close to you, isn't she?
Catherine,
I love you, worship you.
I asked you here tonight because
I want you to do something for me.
I can trust you, can't I?
We'll always be friends, won't we?
Yes, Your Majesty.
What is it you require?
Blow out the candles.
Behind the mirror, as you know, there's a flight of stairs.
Down below, someone is waiting to come up.
Will His Excellency be kind enough to open the door for him carefully... so that he can sneak in?
Her Majesty is waiting for you, Captain.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Will you deliver a message for me, Captain?
I would be very glad to, sir.
Tell Her Majesty that
I quite understand now.
No, never mind.
Don't tell her anything.
- She'll know.
- Yes, sir.
Something for the poor,
Your Majesty?
For the poor, Captain?
Excellency?
Quite a haul tonight, father.
Chancellor?
Elizabeth?
Your Imperial Majesty, something for the poor?
That was for me.
Now what have you got for the poor?
There are no poor in Russia!
Get out!
I've had enough of this sanctimonious talk.
Let us drink.
Why doesn't he take up his collections in church?
To the most charming woman in my empire, my friend, the countess Elizabeth.
Go ask Her Majesty, my wife, why she doesn't join our toast.
His Majesty, the emperor of Russia, wishes me to ask... why Her Majesty refuses to join the toast.
Tell His Majesty that my thirst is not as great as his tonight.
Her Majesty wishes me to convey that her thirst is not as great as his tonight.
Go tell my wife she's a fool.
His Majesty wishes me to inform Her Majesty... that she is a fool.
What is your rank, Orloff?
Captain, Your Majesty.
Well, you're nothing now.
Now get out, both of you, and stay out!
Sit down!
My wife is not to leave the palace.
She's under arrest until further orders.
Am I the emperor of Russia, or am I not?
We'll issue a proclamation that she died... and ask the people to pray for her.
Hurry, Your Majesty.
Everything is ready.
What are you doing here?
Halt!
Exit Peter III.
Enter Catherine II.
We, soldiers in the service of the Holy Russian Empire, do hereby solemnly swear to acknowledge... and to defend with our lives, the authority of Catherine our empress, and to destroy her enemies!
Hooray!
Hooray!
Hooray!
Your Majesty, we're sorry to trouble you,
But Her Majesty isn't in here, is she?
She's no longer in her rooms.
You infernal blockhead! This is the last place in the world she would come to.
Double the guard!
Surround the palace!
Find her and bring her here to me!
God grant you victory,
Catherine.
All Russia is waiting for the sound of our bell.
Why are those bells ringing?
Why are those bells ringing?
I don't know, Peter.
How dare you address me like that!
Who are you?
My name is Orloff, and I'm on duty as guard.
I'll have your head for this insolence!
You're addressing the emperor!
There is no emperor. there is only an empress.

Lyrics: Vladimir Lugovskoi
Prince Alexander Nevsky, son of Yaroslav - N. Cherkasov
Vasily Buslai - N. Okhlopkov
Gavrilo Olexich - A. Abrikosov
Master of the Teuton Order -
V. Ershov
The 13th century.
Knights of the Teuton Order invaded Russia from the West.
Russia's vast and rich lands beckoned an invader.
The German aggressors expected an easy victory over our people:
Russia was still recovering from the Mongol bloodbath.
The countryside was sown with the debris of bloody battles.
- The Pleshcheevo Lake -
There was a battle on the Neva River.
A battle on the wide Neva.
There we fought a vast and vicious enemy.
A cruel adversary, the Swedish host.
The bloody battle raged on.
We broke their ships into matchsticks.
We spilled our blood like water.
All for the sake of our land, the great Mother Russia...
To your knees!
Who are you?
Who were you looking for?
Why are you hitting him?
What's all that shouting?
You are scaring the fish!
Halt!
Don't you start fighting!
A guest who enters a house does not strike its owners.
Who are you?
The Prince of this land,
Alexander.
Is that you they call
''Nevsky''?
Yes.
Are you the one who defeated the Swedes?
So what are you doing here?
Fishing.
Couldn't you find anything better to do?
What's wrong with fishing?
We shall build a fleet and sail to trade overseas. Right?
Come to us, to the Golden Horde.
We will make you a general.
We need warlords.
We have a saying:
''Lt's better to die than to leave your homeland.''
The Russian lands we shall never surrender.
Whoever rises against Russia, will be smitten.
Russia had risen on the enemy at the Novgorod field of glory.
The Mongols are a hard-necked people, a strong people.
It won't be easy fighting them.
Is there a will for the fight?
It is time to avenge the deaths of our forefathers...
The Mongols can wait a while.
We have a more dangerous enemy.
An enemy who is closer and more cruel.
An enemy we could not buy our souls from with ransom:
The Germans.
After we beat them, we shall take care of the Mongols.
Let it be the Germans, then.
You know better where to start but our patience is at its end, Prince!
The Germans cannot be beaten without aid from Novgorod.
The campaign against them must start at Novgorod.
Novgorod is the last stronghold of the Free Russia.
The fish are escaping!
- The Free City of Novgorod -
Vasily Buslai! Gavrilo Olexich!
Come to your old friend.
I have Indian armor,
Tartar spears.
- Sharp Saracen swords.
- Stop lying.
You must have forged them yourself overnight.
Every bird subsists by its own beak.
We are fed up with wars, we are busy with other matters.
The young bulls are frolicking, smelling the spring in the air.
We've won glory in battle, now it's time to think of ourselves.
Have you heard? Vasily is going to get married.
When the she-goat is in the yard, the billy peeks in.
I am tired of spilling blood.
I fight one day, then brood for two.
I wanted to go to the Volga, play about with my battle-axe.
- But the brooding won me over.
- Go be a monk, then.
I am thinking about matters of the heart.
If my wishes are not met,
I may well go to the monastery.
Like a bear, to slaughter calfs on the altar.
Olga Danilovna, allow me to send matchmakers to your father.
- No, I'll be the one to do it.
- Let her give us the sign.
She will tell us whom her heart will choose.
Tell us, Olga Danilovna, which one of us shall be your groom?
Forgive me, good people, I fail to understand your meaning.
What do you mean?
Don't pull the bull by its tail!
Tell us who you will marry.
Choose one of us.
If you want a merry and handsome lad, give me a sign.
If you prefer a more settled and boring type, choose Gavrilo.
If you are looking for lumps, choose Buslai.
If you wish to be a mistress in your home, I'm your partner.
I do not know what to say to you.
Both of you are good.
In time I shall give you my answer.
Brothers! People of Novgorod!
The Germans have taken Pskov and are advancing toward you!
They are slaughtering everyone who dared to take up arms!
One who is caught with a sword, is killed for the sword!
One who is caught with a loaf of bread, is killed for the bread!
Mothers and wives are tortured for their sons and husbands!
The Germans are like wild beasts!
We know them well!
One who raises his voice to scream, is killed for the scream.
One who is silent, is killed for the silence.
They have divided Russia among the German warlords.
One was awarded Pskov, another
- Novgorod!
Leave your trade, good people of Novgorod!
Wait! What is this senseless commotion?
Don't confuse these folks! We have a treaty with the Germans.
What is Pskov to us? If need be, we'll ransom ourselves!
We have surplus of goods, lying around needlessly.
The waterfronts are piled high with goods. The stores are full.
Will you trade Russia for your goods?
What's with you? What Russia?
Where have you seen it last?
It's every man for himself.
Wherever you make your bed, there's your homeland.
You lying dog!
A snake is known by its hiss.
Don't you feed me what I can't swallow!
A mother or a stepmother, it's all the same to the rich!
Where they make a profit, there is their motherland.
To us, the simple folk, the
Germans bring certain death.
We must invite Prince Alexander and strike at the Germans!
- Alexander? Never!
- We don't want Alexander!
- We don't want him!
- Summon Alexander!
Let's not wait for Alexander.
We shall gather a host and strike at the
Germans ourselves!
Domash the son of Tverdislav will lead us into battle.
He has seen harder battles than this. Lead us, Domash!
- Domash for general!
- Lead us into battle, Domash!
We are beset by a great misfortune.
A great trouble requires a great man.
Not I, another leader is needed here.
A man whose arm is stronger and mind is clearer than mine whose glory has spread through the land and reached the enemy!
Who is that man, brothers?
Prince Alexander, son of Yaroslav!
We must invite Alexander and call Russia to arms.
Otherwise the Germans will decimate the Russian people.
We will be squeezed between the Germans and the Mongols and then we'll know what trouble means!
Call for Alexander!
- City of Pskov -
Great Master!
Pskov is at your feet.
That's not the way to make cities surrender.
If you give me Novgorod in this state.
I shall hang you on the nearest tree.
Great Master! Order your men to gather ropes!
Ropes? Why?
To tether the rebels at Novgorod!
They brazenly decided to resist and invited Prince Alexander.
That was the man who defeated the Swedes on the Neva.
A man capable of defeating us has not yet been born.
As to princes, I have enough of my own.
The brave knight Hubertus.
As Lord of all the conquered Russian lands
I dub you the Prince of Pskov.
The glorious knight Dietlieb.
You shall be the
Prince of Novgorod.
Hurry to Novgorod, Ananias.
You must incite the residents against Prince Alexander.
There is only one Lord, who is in heaven and his pontiff on Earth is but one.
There is only one sun to light the whole universe and lend its light to the planets and stars.
Holy Rome alone shall rule the world.
Whoever does not bow to Rome shall be put to death!
Well, do you agree?
It won't be your way, Tverdilo.
Russia won't bow to the Germans.
We have beaten you in the past, we shall beat you yet again!
- All in good time!
- Hang the foul-mouth!
Father!
Let me come with you, father!
Go away, Vasilisa!
Remember our blood!
Avenge us!
Wipe them off of the face of the Earth!
Go to Peryaslavl.
Call Alexander!
Devastated Pskov is crying out for you, Alexander!
- Peryalslavl -
Instead of mending nets we should be fighting the Germans.
Go to sleep!
It's delicate work, not like hitting the Swedes.
Prince! People from Novgorod are asking to see you!
From Novgorod? Bring me my ceremonial dress.
Let them in.
Greetings from the
Great City of Novgorod!
We have come to call you to our aid.
Why? Have you quarrelled among yourselves and have no one to separate you?
The enemy is near, Prince lzborsk has fallen.
Pskov taken.
Pskov?
The Germans are advancing toward Novgorod.
Is Great Novgorod trembling with fear?
Have pity on the orphans, Prince.
Forget the affront,
Alexander.
Rise for Novgorod!
I shall rise to avenge the suffering of Russia.
No truer words have ever been spoken. Rise to her defence!
Defence? I do not know how to defend.
We shall smite them with all our power!
Your warriors are not inferior to the Germans, Prince.
My bodyguard alone is not enough.
We shall call the peasants to arms.
With their help we shall surely defeat the enemy by spring.
Arise, you Russian people!
In a just battle to the death!
Arise, people free and brave!
Rise to defend our fair land!
Our warriors will have honors, our fallen - eternal glory.
For the homes of our fathers, arise, you Russian people!
Arise, you Russian people!
In a just battle to the death!
Arise, people free and brave!
Rise to defend our fair land!
Our warriors will have honors, our fallen - eternal glory.
For the homes of our fathers, arise, you Russian people!
Arise, you Russian people!
In a just battle to the death!
Arise, people free and brave!
Rise to defend our fair land!
We shall not give up Russia, our enemies will be smitten!
Russia has risen against the foe, to fight for Novgorod!
- Novgorod -
We don't want war!
Go back to Peryaslavl!
We don't have any love for you!
You don't have to love me. I have not come to you as a lover.
I came to lead you into battle, Novgorod the Free.
If you don't fight willingly, my lords, the peasants will break your bones!
The Mongols hold Russia from the banks of the Volga to Novgorod.
The Germans are advancing from the West.
Russia is lying between the mallet and the anvil.
You stand alone,
Novgorod the Fair!
Arise for the sake of our motherland, of our people.
Arise for the cities of Russia, for Kiev, Vladimir and Ryazan!
Arise for the sake of our fields, forests and rivers for the sake of our great people!
Lead the armed hosts of Novgorod, Prince!
Lead the armies of Novgorod!
Lead on! Lead on!
Arise, you Russian people!
In a just battle to the death!
Arise, people free and brave!
Rise to defend our fair land!
No foe will tread over Russia, no foreign army will plunder it.
No enemy will find its routes or trample its fields!
Arise, you Russian people!
In a just battle to the death!
Arise, people free and brave!
Rise to defend our fair land!
The spear-forgers donate a thousand spears!
We shall make five hundred shields!
A thousand!
- We give five hundred axes!
- A thousand!
We pledge our lives!
Lead on, Prince Alexander!
Arise, you Russian people!
In a just battle to the death!
Arise, people free and brave!
Rise to defend our fair land!
Take everything!
I'm giving it all away!
If you have no weapon, take one!
Bring death to the enemy!
Arise, you Russian people!
In a just battle to the death!
Even a small bird has a heart.
What say you? There is no more time to wait.
Tomorrow we do battle.
Why keep us waiting?
Speak plainly!
Fate itself will decide for me.
The braver of the two will send his matchmakers to me...
Without proper tools you can't even kill a flea.
Arise, you Russian people!
In a just battle to the death!
Arise, people free and brave!
Rise to defend our fair land!
No foreign make, this.
Forged with my own two hands.
Too bad, the mail is a bit too short.
Arise, you Russian people!
In a just battle to the death!
Arise, people free and brave!
Rise to defend our fair land!
My brothers, you knights! King
Alexander has dared to resist us but God's hand has punished his impertinence.
His advance guard is trapped in the forest, like a bear.
I invite you all to hunt the Russian bear.
Lead them on their way.
The rabbit skips into a ravine, but the fox follows him.
The rabbit runs into the woods, but the fox stays on his tail.
So the rabbit jumps between two birch trees.
The fox comes after him and gets stuck!
It's twisting and turning, but can't get free. What a calamity!
The rabbit looks at her severely and says:
''Now I will violate your chastity''
''No, neighbor, don't put me to such shame! ''
''Have pity! '' cries the fox.
''I have no time for pity.''
Says the rabbit, and violates her!
Got her stuck between the trees, did he?
Yes, he did.
- And violated her?
- He did!
Run for your life, Prince!
Save your army!
The Germans are coming like a tidal wave!
Domash has fallen.
Buslai taken prisoner.
Buslai, a prisoner?
You lying dog!
Buslai would never surrender!
You slanderous swine!
Prepare to rescue them!
- Chudskoye Lake -
- Why are you slipping?
- There is ice under the horses.
We shall stop his horsemen right here, at Raven's Rock.
The ice is thin, Alexander.
It might break under us.
The Germans' armor is heavier. If they break the ice, all the better.
To the shore!
Retreat back to the shore!
Where are you going?
To the shore!
What's your hurry, Vasya?
Isn't there enough space here for you to stand and fight?
These parts are foreign to us and covered with darkness.
It will be easier to fight on our side.
Withdraw your forces from the lake, Prince.
Hurry, Prince, he's talking sense.
We shall return to our side of the lake before sunrise.
It will be easier to fight standing on our own soil.
Every stone there is a friend, every ravine
- a brother.
One who won't fight on enemy soil has no need of his own!
We shall fight on foreign soil. Understood?
I will not let these dogs tread on the soil of Russia!
Peace be with you, Domash...
We shall fight on the lake!
Here, at Raven's Rock, we shall place the main force.
You, Gavrilo, will command the left flank.
I will take the right with my bodyguard.
And will take the assault force, as well.
You, Mikula, have your men lie in ambush.
The Germans will attack in a wedge formation.
The main force will sustain the first blow at Raven's Rock.
- Who will lead the main force?
- You will.
You've been running all night.
In the daytime you shall stand and sustain their blow, halt the German wedge and hold fast until we crush them from the flanks.
Understood?
Let's go.
Take care, Vasily, stand fast against the Germans.
Chain the supply sledges together and put them behind you.
That will make it easier to hold the Germans.
Right!
Don't forget the agreement about Olga.
Don't you, either!
What are you standing around for? Form ranks on the lake.
- April 5, 1242 -
The German wedge!
It is time.
When the Germans hit Buslai, let the wedge stick in deep and then we will hit them together from both sides.
Retreat to the supply train!
Should we move the train back?
Quiet! We shall die where we stand!
Take courage, sons of Novgorod!
Hold them in! Don't let the wedge spread out!
The time has come,
Alexander.
For Russia! For Russia!
For Russia!
Forward, peasant folk, now it's our turn to hit the Germans!
This is a sword of such well-tempered steel.
Tempering is not the main thing.
The strength of a sword is measured by the arm that wields it!
With knowledge you can even kill a warlock!
Where is Vasily Buslai? Buslai!
Here is Vasily!
Here I am!
To your health, Vasya!
Now we can't get at them with swords...
Don't be hasty, Saveliy!
Savka!
Your work shows no results, Gavrilo!
Go on, show us what courage is!
The Prince is with us!
Smite the Germans!
Bring the Master to me!
Take him to the supply train.
We have carried the day!
I surrender.
A quail may be small, but it's still a bird.
Too bad, the mail is too short.
Some lie, torn with swords.
Others lie pierced with arrows.
Their red blood pouring out.
Onto the soil of Russia...
Izaslavna!
Anastasia!
Sister!
He who fell for Russia has died a hero's death.
I kiss your sightless eyes and caress your cold forehead.
As to the daring hero who survived the fight
To him I shall be a loyal wife.
And a loving spouse.
Are you alive, Olexich?
I am... Vasya...
I shall choose a husband for his courage in battle.
Can you hear her voice?
She is searching for us.
Hear my voice, my heroes, answer me.
You are alive!
Dear ones!
- Thank God, you are alive!
- Where are the Germans?
There are no more Germans!
No Germans, my dear ones!
They were defeated!
Spread to the four winds or sunk below the ice!
If so, we have won the day.
Glory to the Prince.
Glory to us all.
We have not shed our blood in vain.
Olga Danilovna.
We have fought shoulder to shoulder.
We have stricken the Germans with all our heart and might.
I shall not live.
Olga... is yours.
What's with you? Are you going to die before the wedding?
What's with you?
No, I have not been destined to live.
I shall not take a wife.
You shall live, and your glory will live with you.
Bow down before Gavrilo.
He was the first in battle, your hand in marriage belongs to him.
Come to your feet, Olexich.
- City of Pskov -
With all this commotion nobody thinks about matters of state.
Good citizens of Pskov and
Novgorod! I would strike you, lash you mercilessly, had you talked away the Ice battle!
Russia would never forgive us for the lack of daring.
So shall you remember it and shall pass it on to your kin.
And should you forget it, you become like Judas - traitors in the eyes of all Russia!
I promise: Should trouble come,
I shall call Russia to arms anew and if you stand idly by,
I shall strike you mercilessly as long as I am alive, and after it will be the duty of my sons!
And now let us have a court of justice.
We should free the foot soldiers. What say you?
What shall we do with them?
They were forced to fight.
And what about the noble knights?
We shall ask for ransom!
Exchange them for soap!
What should we do with him?
You, the people, should decide his fate!
No enemy shall tread on Russian soil.
Arise, my people, arise!
Give my judgement, Prince.
Decide the fate of the girl!
I said I shall not choose the better-looking one but the one who was more prominent in battle.
My son Vasily has never been second-best to anyone!
They won't let a man live or die in peace.
Forgive me, mother, for contradicting your words.
I have never gone against your will. Don't slander Gavrilo.
Judging fairly, neither of us deserves to be the groom.
Vasilisa was blessed with the greatest courage of all!
There were none braver than she!
Gavrilo was the next best man.
To this I pledge my honor before the people.
So be it.
You have disgraced your mother!
I wanted to get you married.
So where's the problem?
There will be a wedding yet!
Couldn't you even be the first in battle?
I wasn't the last.
Take for your daughter-in-law the girl in the chain mail.
What a beauty!
I haven't lost yet, mother.
And now...
Let us celebrate!
Hooray!
Let's agree in advance, at home keep your fists to yourself.
Go and tell everyone in the foreign lands that Russia lives.
He who comes to us as a guest, let him come with no reservation.
But he who comes to us with a sword, shall die by the sword.
On this stands Russia, and on this she shall stand forever.
''He who comes to us with a sword
''shall die by the sword.
''On this stands Russia
''and on this she shall stand forever.''
Point for M. de Lesseps.
Point 30.
Bravo, that was wonderful.
Eighth game and second set to
Mr le Vicomte de Latour.
Better keep your mind on the game.
Mesdames et Messieurs
Monsieur le Président de la République
Look at that. He sits down on that throne as if he liked it.
After all, Louis Napoleon is a Bonapart.
Emperors seem to run in his family.
As a staunch believer in the Republic, that's exactly why I'm worried.
You better keep your mind on the game.
Third and deciding set.
Mr de Lesseps will serve.
Who's that playing against de Latour?
Ferdinand de Lesseps, Mr le Président.
Son of our Consul-General to Egypt.
Oh, yes, he's a fine officer, isn't he?
One of our most promising young diplomats.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Du Brey...
Who's that?
Countess Eugenie de Montijo, from Madrid.
She's very enthusiastic about the game.
Especially when young de Lesseps is playing.
The young man has a keen eye for other things than a tennis ball.
See that Mr de Lesseps is invited to my next reception.
Yes, Mr le Président.
And, of course, Countess... what's her name, too.
Yes, Mr le Président.
Le Conte Hatzfeldt, Baron Dreissen.
Mr Franz Lizst.
Ah, Mr Lizst, I shall have the pleasure of asking you to play later this evening.
It will be my honor, Mr le Président.
Let me help.
Ferdinand, you mustn't in front of all these people.
It's your fault for looking so beautiful.
If you don't stop
I won't have any reputation left at all.
Why, haven't you already shocked half Paris by riding astride?
That was different.
Oh, yes, I know you look very charming in breeches.
Thank you.
Oh, Ferdinand.
There's a fortune teller.
And before the year is out... you will be married for the fourth time.
Good evening, Eugenie. Isn't it marvelous?
My fourth marriage.
I've only just lost my second husband.
Louis, dear, your party is so different.
Only you would think of having a fortune teller.
I'm glad you're enjoying yourself,
Duchess.
Oh, you haven't been presented.
Let me.
The Countess Eugenie de Montijo,
Mr le Président.
Mr le Président.
I had heard that the Countess de Montijo was one of the most beautiful women in Paris.
Oh, really?
For once the gossips didn't exaggerate.
Thank you.
And this is Mr de Lesseps.
I have always had great respect for your father.
I'm happy to meet his son.
Mr le Président is very kind.
May I have the pleasure of this waltz?
Oh... why, yes, of course.
Would you excuse us, please?
Don't they make a handsome pair?
Yes.
Mr le Président.
The British ambassador has just arrived.
Oh, yes. Du Brey has no manners.
He's always intruding.
Will you forgive me?
Of course, I understand.
May I hope for another dance?
With pleasure.
Monsieur le Marquis.
René, good evening, how are you?
Good evening, Eugenie.
Will the most beautiful woman not only in Paris but in the entire world honor me with this next dance?
Let's have our fortunes told instead.
He doesn't need his fortune told.
No?
He's already predicted a most brilliant future for himself.
Oh, but what about my future?
That's easy.
You're going to share mine.
We'll see what the swami has to say about that.
Sahib, memsahib.
We'd like one of your best fortunes for the young lady.
One of your very best for us now, please.
The sand falls slowly.
I see difficulties.
Yes, I see a troubled life.
But a great one.
You will live a hundred years and wear a crown.
René, she really believes the fortune.
Since you're being so generous, you can tell mine.
The sand tells a strange story.
You shall dig ditches.
Ferdinand de Lesseps, the great diplomat.
France expects ditches.
Since you're laughing so hard, let's hear yours.
If I knew Louis Napoleon's future,
I'd know mine.
That's a very interesting idea.
We'd like you to tell us Louis Napoleon's future.
Very good idea,
Only if he himself is here.
Well, let me try.
Here, let me try.
Abracadabra...
I see a throne.
An imperial throne.
Who's this approaching?
Why, it's Louis Napoleon.
In one hand he carries the tri-color of the Republic.
Where's that?
Right there.
He walks forward, looks at the throne...
Looks at the tri-color.
Puts it behind his back.
Then he walks toward the throne.
He starts up the stairs.
That's hard going.
He keeps tripping on the tri-color.
Very amusing.
May I...
Ferdinand, this is our dance.
Mr le Président.
Don't you think I...
No, no, you'd only make it worse.
The young man is a wit.
A pity to waste him on Paris where we have so many wits.
Oh, that's nice.
I designed it especially for mademoiselle.
Oh, it's lovely.
It is beautiful, mademoiselle.
Ravissant.
If mademoiselle will permit,
I shall name ir Eugenie.
That's very nice of you.
Thank you.
Monsieur.
Don't you think it would be better if that were... down just that much?
No, no, mademoiselle, no.
Well, I guess I suppose you're right.
Mr le Marquis du Brey is here, mademoiselle.
Du Brey?
Oh!
Yes, of course, I'll see him at once.
Bien, mademoiselle.
Mr le Marquis.
Mademoiselle.
Pardon me for calling at this hour, but Mr. le Président desires an early answer.
Would you please tell Mr le Président
I should love to.
Mademoiselle.
Mr le Marquis.
Au revoir, monsieur.
Merci mil fois, mademoiselle.
Mon plaisir.
Thank you very much.
The hat's a creation.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Eugenie.
Ferdinand.
Eugenie, darling. I'm leaving for Egypt in an hour and forty-five minutes.
Will you marry me?
What?
I'm going there as secretary of the Consulate.
Marry me, come with me.
René's gone for the license.
What license, what are you talking about?
The marriage license.
Quick packing things.
We've just time to get to the church.
But I couldn't possibly do a thing like that.
You know I couldn't.
Darling, don't you understand?
I may be gone a year, five years.
This may be our last chance.
Oh, Ferdinand, are you insane?
No...
Yes.
Don't you see?
It just isn't possible.
Yes, I see.
I've made an idiot of myself as usual.
Asking you to change your whole life, marry a nobody and go to live in a desert.
You're not a nobody.
You never could be.
Never.
It's... it's just such a leap in the dark and I...
Oh, darling, you must understand, you've got to, you do, don't you?
Yes...
I understand.
Oh...
I wish I could go with you.
No...
I won't ask you again.
It wouldn't be fair.
But please remember this...
Whether I'm here or in Egypt no matter where I am
I'll always love you.
Goodbye, Eugenie.
Goodbye.
Well, here you are.
I got it.
You know, I had a terrible time...
Oh...
I'm sorry.
Thanks, just the same.
The new gown is ready, mademoiselle.
Take it away. I don't want to see it.
Take it away, mademoiselle?
Yes, yes, Julie, please.
Driver, stop.
Hassan! Hassan!
Hassan! Hassan!
Oh, you bad donkey.
Wait a minute...
Oh, you dirty pig.
Come back at once or I will cut your heart out.
I beg your pardon?
Oh...
I was talking to Hassan.
Hassan?
Yes, my donkey.
But you'll do.
At your service, mademoiselle.
Make him bring back my little house.
My clothes are in it.
Why don't you come out and get them yourself?
Shame on you.
My dear young lady, I don't mind seeing you in your bathing dress.
Oh...
Shame on you.
It's none of your business.
Go away.
Good afternoon, mademoiselle.
Oh, no!
No, monsieur, please, no.
I didn't mean it.
Oh, please, monsieur.
Make him bring back.
Come on, Hassan.
You mustn't keep the lady waiting.
No, no, no!
Don't you know anything about donkeys?
Make believe you want to make him go forward.
Forward?
Hm-hm.
Forward, Hassan.
On to victory.
Come on.
That's right.
That's the way, come on.
Good!
Now look the other way.
Hey, hey, hey.
I'll be dressed in a minute.
What's your name?
De Lesseps.
Oh, you're the son.
We've been expecting you.
We?
Yes. All the French people here.
We heard you were very good-looking...
And you are.
What's your name?
Marie Antoinette Germaine Fernande Françoise
I'm very happy to know you,
Mademoiselle Prrrr.
Occupation?
Young lady.
Young lady of leisure, eh?
Married?
No, but I could have been.
Many times.
Everybody wants to marry me.
Are you married?
No.
Good.
I'm glad somebody's happy about it.
Well, now help me down.
We got wet, didn't we?
Yes.
His Excellency is in the garden, efendi.
This way, efendi.
Ah, here we are.
How are you, sir?
My boy.
I'd have come to meet you myself but...
I had some business with the Viceroy that couldn't wait.
What's happened to you?
I had a slight adventure.
Let me present my son.
Sir Malcolm Cameron.
Her Britanic Majesty's Consul General.
Don't get up, sir.
How are you?
I hope you'll pardon my appearance but I seem to have fallen into the Mediterranean.
Don't tell me that Louis Napoleon is so pressed for money that he makes his diplomats swim to their posts.
No, but we Frenchmen must do our swimming in the Mediterranean while we still have the chance.
Hm?
Before it becomes a British pond.
Young man, you'll be here watching.
Well, here's to a long stay.
And a successful one.
Well, a successful one anyway.
Thank you.
Well, I must be off.
Thanks for the drink, Mathieu.
I'll see you at the Viceroy's reception tonight.
It's been a pleasure to meet you, young man.
Thank you, Sir Malcolm.
So that's Sir Malcolm Cameron, eh?
Yes, do you know about him?
Only what everyone in the Foreign Office knows.
That when England sets him to watch the kettle it means something important is brewing.
Right you are.
We must do our best to upset it.
Come, get out of these rags before you take cold.
A diplomat with a sore throat is about as useful as a fiddle without strings.
Elle a de nouveau le costume de bain.
Toni! Toni!
Where are you?
Where have you been?
Running off without telling me.
Bad disciplice gives the army a bad name.
Yes, grandfather.
Don't grandfather me.
I'm ranking sargeant of the Consulate detail and I expect obedience.
Yes, Sargeant.
Look at this. Gray as a goose.
I spend all afternoon hunting for the hair dye.
I hid it, grandfather.
I was afraid one of the men might see it.
Alors, bien, get it!
It's terrible. What must the army think of us?
Where have you been?
Swimming with Mr de Lesseps.
What?
No, no, grandfather.
His son, the young one.
Hm?
Oh, he's so funny.
So polite.
I think I'll fall in love with him.
What?
The Consul General's son?
I forbid it, you understand?
This is an order.
Yes, grandfather.
Yes, who?
Yes, Sargeant.
Enchanté.
Ah, Sir Malcolm. Delighted to see you.
Your Highness, another evening to charm the memory and ruin the figure.
Mathieu.
Malcolm.
How are you?
Alla wa Salaam ya sahibi.
Allah wa Salam ya kedive.
The presence of my good friend honors my house.
It is my great pleasure, Your Highness, to present my son.
It is my great pleasure to welcome to my court another of your illustrious family.
Thank you.
Who is that?
That is Prince Said, the next Viceroy of Egypt.
And your first assignment.
What am I supposed to do with him?
Cultivate him.
Make a friend of him.
So, here you are.
Trying to catch a glimpse of the young gentleman, eh?
Come now. Get along with you.
Do your marketing.
Yes, grandfather.
What?
Yes, Sargeant.
His Highness, Prince Said, is calling to see Mr Ferdinand de Lesseps.
I'll tell him.
No, don't go, grandfather. I'll tell him.
Mr de Lesseps, please.
He's in his office.
You mustn't go in.
He's very busy.
Oh, who cares.
I'm sorry, but he doesn't wish to be disturbed.
Very well.
Mademoiselle. Please, don't go in...
Hello.
Hello, yourself.
What are you doing here?
I just dropped in.
So I see.
Look here, Toni. I'm very busy.
Who is she?
A friend of mine.
I suppose you are in love with her.
She doesn't look like much.
Now look here, Toni,
I've got a lot of very dull work to do and my mind isn't on it.
And it's hot.
I wish to heaven I were back in Paris and the flies are driving me mad and now you have to come in and make matters worse.
All right. I just came to tell you that he's here.
Who?
You know.
The Prince.
Said?
You mean to say that you've left him waiting out...
I only wanted to talk to you.
You're not angry with me?
I ought to take you over my knee and spank you.
Oh, why don't you?
These men coming from Paris are so edgy.
Good afternoon, Mathieu.
Good afternoon, Malcolm.
I was hoping you'd join me.
Thank you.
What are you doing?
Brushing up on your tricks?
Maybe I'll need them, now that I have two of you to fight.
Only one, I'm sorry to say.
I'm going back to Paris.
Paris?
Yes, I've just had a letter from
Victor Hugo.
Things look pretty bad.
I shall miss you, Mathieu.
There's no fun bowling at an empty wicket, you know.
Don't be too sure about that.
I'm leaving my son in charge here.
Poor lad, eh?
Yes, haven't told him yet.
Poor fellow,
I'm afraid it will be a blow to him.
What's that?
En garde.
Right. A simple.
En garde.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Parry quatre.
Move your arm a little more to the left for parry quatre. Ready?
Good boy, Your Highness.
I get rid of the old fox and he leaves me with the young one.
Wait.
Here we go.
Up we go.
Please, could I rest in my father's carriage for a few hours?
Of course, if you must.
But remember, you promised to ride all the way to Suez.
Oh, all right. I will ride.
Good boy, Said.
Good morning, grandfather.
What?
Good morning, Sargeant.
Toni, you had your orders to stay in Alexandria.
Yes, I know.
But I was worried about you.
About me? What do you mean?
Look.
See? Gray as a goose.
Shhh.
If I don't fix it, they'll be calling you old man Pellerin.
You ready, Said?
My friend...
I cannot ride with you today.
This morning the boxing, yesterday eight hours in the saddle.
All right.
You've earned a day on your back.
Ah, thank you.
There.
I don't like this.
This camp is no place for a young woman.
I'll take you home tomorrow.
This is no discipline.
Hey, where are you going?
Hello.
Well, what are you doing here?
I followed you all the way from Alexandria.
Are you glad I came?
Oh, look.
Let's race the storm to the ruins.
See? Now we can both keep warm.
Maybe it could rain for hours.
No, it's just a squall.
It'll be over in a few minutes.
I can ride better than she can.
She, who?
That girl in the picture.
Yes, you do ride very well.
That's from being in the army.
And she isn't as pretty as I am.
Is she?
Well, she's considered the most beautiful woman in Europe.
She is not.
You think so because you are in love with her.
Oh, I hate her.
For heaven's sake, come on, Toni, sit up.
Sit up.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't help it.
It always happens.
What do you mean.
When a woman falls in love with a man.
Listen to me.
You mind if I give you a little friendly advice?
No.
Forget about this falling-in-love business.
But I don't want to forget it.
Don't you like me?
Come on. The storm's passed.
Look, a rainbow.
Grandfather says there is a pot of gold at the end.
One in the Mediterranean and the other in the Red Sea.
What a pot of gold for the world if they could be joined, the Red Sea and the Mediterranean.
Look, Toni.
Water in the old gulf.
Just as it was centuries ago when the Phoenicians sailed through.
Can you imagine ships sailing right through here where we're standing?
Ships?
Yes. Not ancient galleys, modern ships.
Steamers sailing a short trade route to the East.
It could be done.
No elevations, no rock formations.
Just a simple sand d... ditch.
And I was told
I was going to dig ditches.
There's fate in this, Toni.
Something sent me here to Egypt when I didn't want to come... kept me here when I wanted to leave.
I thought it was a dead end.
It has been up to now.
But I could make this...
I could make this spot that we're standing on the crossroads of the Earth.
Why, think of it, Toni. A canal stretching through from the Mediterranean.
Open to the ships of all nations.
It could be done.
And I can do it.
I was looking for a way to serve France.
And I think...
I think I found a way to serve the world.
My plan is to form a stock company in Paris.
To finance the construction of the canal.
But before I can go ahead,
I must have Your Highness' assurance that Egypt will lease to us the necessary strip of territory.
I regret that I cannot give you that assurance.
What can Your Highness lose?
We take all the risk.
You are young, my friend.
The wisdom of age will teach you the folly of tampering with the work of Allah.
What man can accomplish is also the work of Allah.
Since we are his creatures, obeying his wishes.
Unfortunately one must also consider the wishes of the Turkish government.
Does this objection come from
Constantinople?
Or from London?
From London.
Do you mean your government would oppose the construction of the canal?
I do.
But why?
Can't they see that England would be the first to benefit by a canal through the isthmus?
Think how it would shorten the sailing time to India.
To England's possessions in the East.
No doubt.
But my government wants no short pathway to the East.
There's always Napoleon sitting on the gate.
But it's absurd to think that any one nation would dominate the canal.
It would be open to the world.
Your Highness, if you allow these selfish political considerations to sway you, Egypt, not France, will be the greater loser.
I'm sorry.
I'd like to help you.
But my hands are tied.
How did you get in here?
I'm your secretary.
Since when?
From now on.
Look, Toni, can't you find some place else to play?
I'm not in a very good humor.
Good humor or bad humor, you must have a secretary to help you.
Well, you can take those books on the trade routes of the ancient Phoenicians back to the library.
Which books?
The trade routes of the ancient Phoenicians.
What's the matter, can't you read?
Didn't you go to school?
Oh, yes.
For how long?
About two days.
It was so dull, I ran away.
His Highness Prince Said.
I'm sorry, my friend.
If I were the Viceroy...
Thanks.
Thanks, Said.
Toni, does this sun out here in Egypt ever do strange things to people?
Sometimes it makes them see things.
That explains it.
I must've been having hallucinations.
Delusions of grandeur thinking that I could change the map of the world.
Who knoes, my friend?
Inch'Allah.
And I thought I was going to Paris with you to be your secretary.
Secretary and you can't even read?
I could go to school in Paris.
In a few days I learn to read.
And then I could be your secretary.
We won't have to worry about that now.
Because we won't be going to Paris.
His Highness the Viceroy.
This is a great honor, Your Highness.
Won't you come in.
I've been thinking about your project, monsieur.
And the advantages it would bring to Egypt.
Yes, Your Highness?
As you know, I cannot officially give you permission to proceed.
But I owe you much.
I repeat. I cannot officially give you permission, but if you wish to go ahead with your preparations you have my personal promise that when the time comes my son and I will do our utmost to find a way to help you.
May Allah bless you, my boy.
What did I tell you, huh?
Pellerin.
Yes, sir.
Sargeant, you have your orders.
Take Toni to the boarding school, then report to my father's office.
Yes, sir.
I don't suppose I could start school tomorrow?
You start today.
But you will come to see me.
Of course I will.
No, no, I won't leave you.
Take me with you.
No, Toni, no.
Sargeant, don't just stand there, do something.
Attention, Toni, what's all this?
Thank you.
You better take her away before she causes a riot.
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
René, good to see you.
You know, that's just Toni.
She's the old Sargeant's granddaughter and a perpetual nuisance.
Oh, no, no!
Come here. What are you doing?
In a way, that little Toni was the inspiration for the greatest project ever concieved by the mind of man.
I suppose I'm in for one of your orations.
Eugenie. Did you give her my message?
Well, no. You see...
I couldn't.
The dispatch was rather late in arriving and... when I called on her she was out.
Oh.
Fire away, my friend. I'm all ears for news of this canal of yours.
Good heavens!
All I need to start operations is the necessary money.
I see. And how do you expect to raise it?
Simple.
The Bank of France will float a loan to raise part of it and the rest will be raised by the sale of shares to the public.
In fact, you will be one of the first buyers.
Who me? Oh, no.
I'm just a poor politician.
I've been told there's no such thing as a poor politician.
Well, it's the first time in my life that
I've ever known a fortune teller to be right.
And you would try and dig the biggest ditch in all history.
It's been kept out of the papers.
I was hoping you already knew.
Yes, I'm afraid Eugenie also takes her fortune tellers seriously.
Yes...
He said she'd wear a crown.
Remarkable fellow, that fortune teller.
The waters of the Red Sea are
30 feet higher than those of the Mediterranean.
If a canal were cut across the isthmus it would cause the waters of the Red Sea to flow into the Mediterranean flooding every port in Southern Europe.
That is the opinion of my engineering experts.
But that's absurd.
Any schoolboy knows that open seas the world over seek the same level.
Are you an engineer?
No. But I claim enough elementary physics and common sense to know that the Red Sea couldn't flood the Mediterranean.
I'm afraid you've allowed your enthusiasm to flood your sense of discretion.
I'm sorry. I must accept the verdict of my engineers.
I'm inclined to agree with our excitable young friend.
But we have more important things before us.
Why haven't you been to see me?
Would I have been welcome?
But of course.
Old friends are always welcome.
Then you do consider me a friend.
I've been worried about you.
Wondering what you thought.
I wanted to explain...
Is it necessary for old friends to explain?
Do come soon.
I want to hear about all you did in Egypt and the canal, what progress you're making with it.
Why don't you ask your friend
Louis Napoleon about that?
I'm sorry. Eugenie.
I'll come soon.
Contesse.
Yes. Yes, I...
Eugenie, Eugenie...
Eugenie.
Yes, yes, what is it?
You have to dress quickly.
What is it? Is something wrong?
I'm afraid so.
Rioting has broken out all over the city.
Rioting?
Yes.
The Marquis du Brey is waiting.
Louis Napoleon wants you at the palace immediately.
Yes, of course, I'll come at once.
Hurry.
Victor, I think you know everybody.
Oh, this is my son.
Mr Victor Hugo.
Messieurs, it's 1848 all over again.
Violence breaking out all over the city.
I repeat, messieurs.
Our duty, as members of the Assembly, is to stand fast.
It is my firm belief that Louis Napoleon is deliberately provoking all this disorder to give him an excuse for demanding the adjournment of the Assembly.
Don't let's forget that Napoleon's argument all along has been that the Assembly's refusing to adjourn is responsible for this rioting.
You will excuse me, messieurs,
I have work to do.
The poor boy has had a cruel disappointment.
I hope he doesn't take it too hard.
The Contesse de Montijo is here, monsieur.
I had to come.
I need your help.
My help?
Yes.
Louis feels you can break this terrible deadlock in the Assembly.
Oh, I see.
I'm sorry, Eugenie.
If there's a crisis,
Napoleon has only himself to blame.
Oh, but it's all so ridiculous.
Louis doesn't want the throne.
All he wants is a strong, orderly government.
What do you think those people out there are shouting for?
Monsieur Bonapart the President, or Louis Napoleon the Emperor?
Ferdinand, he's not responsible for every crackpot in Paris.
Please listen to me.
I know you dislike him and
I don't blame you.
My dislike is political, not personal.
We must forget even our political differences now.
Ferdinand, come here.
Look at that.
It's going on all over France.
Riots, bloodshed.
There may even be a civil war.
Don't you see?
It's for the good of France.
That's all Louis is thinking of, believe me.
But I wouldn't know what to do even if I wanted to help.
I have no political influence.
But your father has.
Convince him that the Assembly should adjourn.
Then, when order has been restored,
Louis promises to reconvene it without taking away any of its power.
My father wouldn't hear of it.
I know how he feels about Napoleon.
He doesn't trust him.
Even with his written promise that he means what he says?
And if even with this you feel you can't trust him you know you can trust me.
Messieurs.
Your attention, please.
I bring you an offer of compromise direct from Napoleon.
And what is his offer?
First he asks that the Assembly adjourn at once.
Impossible.
But... he gives his solemn promise to reconvene it as soon as the rioting has been stopped.
But don't you realize what he's asking?
That we throw away our one weapon our strength of numbers.
He'd never dare invade the Assembly to arrest us.
But separated, disbanded, we'd be helpless.
An easy prey.
At the mercy of any charge he might trump up against us.
But Mr de Lesseps...
His promise, he's given his word.
Word of a Bonapart.
The Bonaparts, whatever their ambitions, have always been men of honor.
Have we the right to gamble our liberties on the promise of one man?
And on the scratch of a pen to hold him to it?
On the contrary, sir.
Father, there's so much at stake.
The peace of France.
Maybe the future of all of us.
When I was coming here just now
I saw rioting bloodshed in the streets.
Frenchmen lifting their hands against each other.
No one questions your patriotism, sir.
But I love France too.
And believe me, you can best serve your country and liberty by doing what Napoleon asks.
Well, messieurs, what do you say?
I think we should bring this before the Assembly at once.
And suppose they refuse to listen to us?
They'll listen to you, sir.
L'Assemblée est ajournée.
L'Assemblée est ajournée.
The Assembly is adjourned.
I expect you to have every important member of the opposition behind bars before morning.
Except, of course, young Mr de Lesseps.
He will find that his Emperor is great.
Gentlemen, you have your instructions.
Louis, you promised me.
You told me I could promise him.
What have you made me do?
Something for France that I couldn't do myself.
But they'll blame him.
They'll call him a traitor.
I'm sorry, of course.
But it will be only a temporary unpleasantness.
And he shall have his reward.
I intend to give his canal project my full support.
Oh, no, Louis, you don't understand.
His family and his honor, they mean so much to him.
In a crisis, the individual is unimportant.
The State is everything.
The State.
France, floundering in the phallacy of democracy. its industry idle, its army weak, crippled by the poisonous doctrines of the
Republicans and the Socialists, has called me to save it from anarchy and ruin.
I had to act swiftly, ruthlessly, but act.
If I have used young de Lesseps badly it was for a great end.
You have used me too, Louis.
What can I possibly say to him?
What will he think?
The opinion of one man should be a matter of little concern to the future Empress of France.
I'm sorry, Vicomte, you're under arrest.
Arrest?
By whose order?
By order of the Emperor.
Emperor?
Why, in the face of this?
Oh, thank you, Vicomte.
I've been looking for that.
But look here, Du Brey,
Napoleon promised me that...
Have no fear, de Lesseps.
Napoleon keeps his promises.
He's most grateful.
Grateful?
I don't know what he's talking about.
So, that's what it was.
I see.
Your canal.
Look here, René.
You don't believe that I...
Lackey, I'm ready.
René!
René.
René.
René.
Your father will be proud of you for this.
Where's my father?
In his room, monsieur.
Sir Malcolm.
A stroke, monsieur.
Sir Malcolm.
Sir Malcolm... you were my father's best friend.
You must believe me.
Because I was his friend, I will spare you my opinion of yourself.
A high price to pay... for a ditch.
Toni. Where are you going?
Shhh.
But, no, no, mademoiselle.
Mr de Lesseps cannot be disturbed at this hour of the night.
Especially after what has happened.
Perhaps tomorrow.
But mademoiselle, mademoiselle...
Oh, dear,
I'm so sorry.
At least he died thinking it was a dream.
You mustn't.
Sit down.
It's late.
Try to sleep.
Sleep.
I will tell monsieur that you are here, mademoiselle.
Yes, thank you.
Monsieur.
He won't see you.
But he must. It's terribly important.
No. I won't let you.
But why?
Who are you?
His friend.
The only one he has left.
How could you do this to him?
First you break his heart, then you make everybody hate him.
What kind of a woman are you?
Get out. Go away and keep away from him
Toni.
Ferdinand, don't listen to her.
No, no.
I didn't know.
I swear I didn't.
Louis promised me and then he broke his promise.
You do believe me, don't you?
Yes, I believe you, if it makes any difference.
It does, of course it does.
You see...
I...
I have a message for you.
He wants to make amends.
Amends?
Can he bring my father back to life?
Will he tell Paris the truth and clear our name?
He can't. You see, it might...
It might show the savior of France in a rather bad light.
Now, will you go?
Please.
Ferdinand, there's one thing we can do.
There's nothing anyone can do.
Have you forgotten your dream?
The canal?
What about it?
Louis has promised me to withdraw his objections.
He'll do anything you want.
And suppose I accept.
Then everyone in Paris will be convinced that what they're already whispering is true.
That I sold my party, my friends... and my father's life for a ditch.
Tomorrow they'll hear the truth if I have to spend the rest of my life in prison.
What do you care what they think or what they say as long as you know you did nothing dishonorable.
I never want to hear of that ditch again as long as I live.
You're very fond of him, aren't you?
Well, so am I.
And perhaps I know him a little bit better than you.
He's a dreamer, a creator.
He was put on earth to do great things.
This mustn't stop.
He owes it to the world and to himself to go through with his plans.
Oh, my dear...
He believes in you.
Don't let him give up.
You must make him realize that he's got to go on whatever the cost.
He never will. He's beaten.
No, no, you're wrong.
There's something in him that'll never let him stop.
It's a fire a greatness that isn't in you or me.
Oh, keep that lighted.
You can do it.
You've got to do it.
Look. The riot is all over.
Isn't it a beautiful morning?
What can you do?
If you try to make people believe you it means prison.
To be in prison these days is a guarantee of honor.
Don't you understand?
I can't go on forever having people think I'm a traitor, a Judas.
I know you're not.
And you didn't have to tell me.
You're a stubborn little imp, aren't you?
It's because I believe in you.
This has just arrived by special messenger, sir.
It looks most important.
I'll read it for you.
I can read very well now.
Te-le... Telegram.
Telegram.
Oh, yes, telegram.
From His Highness...
Said Pacha.
It's your friend.
Go on.
Vice... viceroy.
Muhammad Ali is dead.
Said is Viceroy of Egypt.
Really?
He wants to know when I'm coming to start work on the canal.
You can begin at once.
There is nothing to stop you now.
No.
There's nothing to stop me now.
But I can't do it.
So you can do it.
I thought you were going to do this wonderful thing for the world as you said.
And the old Viceroy trusted you.
And Said trusted you.
But you don't care anything about them any more.
Only about your honor and what people say.
I know you are honorable.
But I want you to be more than that.
I want you to be great.
And when the day comes
I want to stand beside you and see the ships go through the canal and know you built it for all the people in the world.
Our line runs a little East of Sour till we reach the Ballah Lakes.
Soft sand most of the way.
Send word to Port Said that we start digging tomorrow morning.
Mr de Lesseps, we just had news that the Viceroy is shipping 20.000 labourers from Alexandria.
Splendid. My compliments to
Captain le Duc.
And see that housing is prepared for the men immediately.
Yes, sir.
Mr de Lesseps...
I've just heard that our last consignment of blasting powder from Port Said was captured by Arab raiders.
Arabs.
Have we enough to carry on?
For a little while, sir.
Order another ship from Marseilles.
Yes, sir.
We'll deal with the Arabs when the Viceroy arrives.
This Arab is no Arab.
He is a Turkish soldier.
Turkish?
But the Sultan promised us he wouldn't intefere.
No, not openly.
But there are ways of interfering.
When there is trouble, you can count on me, my friend.
It is good to see my people happy.
You have done much for them.
Much more than giving them work, you have given them hope.
They know your canal will bring new life to Egypt.
They have their ruler to thank for that too.
Letter from Paris, sir.
It's from Toni.
You remember her, Your Highness.
Ah, yes, the little one.
She's been studying her lessons.
Look how her handwriting's improved.
Don't go, Sargeant.
You'll want to hear what's in here too.
Yes, sir.
I miss you very much.
I hope you miss me too.
The Emperor and Eugenie were... married last week.
All we girls from the the school went and stood outside the church.
She loked very beautiful and the crowd cheered.
I cheered too.
I was so glad she was married.
Give my love to your...
She sends Your Highness her love.
Oh, thank you.
Tell grandfather that I am sending him a bottle of his... hair tonic, Sargeant.
They've pardoned all the political prisoners to celebrate their wedding. including your friend Latour.
So I celebrated too.
I ran away from school and... now I'm his secretary.
That little rascal.
He writes things against the Emperor and we have them printed secretly.
I will send for her at once, sir.
No.
There's no place for her here...
She's in good hands with René.
First thing he knows she'll be writing his pamphlets for him.
She's very fierce, the little one, eh?
Yes. Takes after her grandmother.
The Emperor abandons the Suez Canal!
The Emperor abandons the Suez Canal!
The Emperor abandons the Suez Canal!
Who is it?
Toni.
I thought it might be the police again.
Do you know what this means?
Yes...
I was afraid this would happen.
But what does it mean?
It means Louis Napoleon expects trouble with Prussia over Alsace and Lorraine.
And Bismarck evidently intends to have them even if it means war.
You see, my dear,
France needs England's friendship
And England will not stand for the Canal.
But it's Ferdinand's.
He's building the Canal.
Even Napoleon cannot stop him.
You forget that he's an emperor.
With one stroke of the pen he can cut off every sou of the Canal's financial backing.
But he's been working all this time.
They must let him finish it.
They cannot do this.
I won't let them.
I'm afraid there's very little that you or I or anyone else can do when Prussia rattles the saber.
Your Majesty.
The Suez Canal is far too important to France and to the world to be used as just a political pawn.
I urge upon you most earnestly to reconsider your action.
And let me finish this great project.
And embark upon a war with Prussia without the support or at least the neutrality of England?
Why is there any need for war if Your Majesty sincerely desires peace?
Peace without honor?
Can I disregard my destiny?
The motto of the Bonaparts is still
Glory for France.
Your Majesty, the officials have arrived.
I'm sorry, I can give you no more time.
Gentlemen.
You see?
Week after week to watch ambition undermine him, destroy his balance and his judgment.
He wants war, glory.
That's all he thinks of now.
Now I know where it will end.
Finish the Empire.
What will you do if he...
If he loses?
And the Empire falls?
Why, stay with him, of course.
He'll need me then.
You see, Ferdinand, once I made a choice.
Maybe it was a mistake but... it was my choice.
And you've made my problem yours.
And failed you.
Yes, Ferdinand, I failed.
But you won't.
You'll win.
Not through Louis' help or mine... but through your on efforts.
I don't know how, but... somehow you'll do it.
Do you have so much faith in me?
Why, I've never lost it.
And I never will.
Goodbye, Ferdinand.
Toni.
Always when I need you.
I almost didn't know you.
Is that a compliment?
You're lovely.
That's the first time you ever told me.
Oh, I brought a friend of yours.
René.
So you see...
I've found my niches of pamphleteer for democracy.
True, I haven't as great a reading public as Rousseau had, but
I manage. And Toni here has been a tremendous help.
Except with the spelling.
You know, she edits everything I write.
If I didn't, you'd go back to prison.
But from now on... we're going to be together the three of us, hm?
Where you go, we'll go.
I'm leaving for England tomorrow.
England? Well, don't you think first a long rest...
Rest?
You are going to stay right here and let René and me take care of you.
The only thing that stands in my way now is the English government.
My one chance is to go there before it's too late.
Explain it to them.
Break down their opposition.
I must go there at once and try to see the Prime Minister.
I'm sorry, Mr de Lesseps.
I cannot support a project that is clearly opposed to the best interests of England.
But I assure you it will be of the greatest benefit to England.
Many of your own countrymen are convinced of this.
Men of vision who can see beyond mere national boundaries.
I disagree with you, sir, completely.
In fact, at this very time, we are debating in Parliament this insane policy of reckless expansion for England.
Englishmen should keep their eyes on their own boundaries not gaze moonstruck on foreign shores and fly-by-night foreign schemes like yours.
I'm sorry, Mr de Lesseps.
I bid you good afternoon, sir.
The conduct of our colonial policy has been criticized by those who have placed the welfare and safety of our colonies above the welfare and safety of England
They would risk their heads to save their limbs.
Our first duty is to the mother country.
England.
I would not trade the meanest
English county for all our colonial possessions.
The path of headlong expansion is the path to disaster.
Mr Speaker, sir.
You have just heard the Prime Minister most ably and eloquently urge your support of the government's colonial policy.
To his noble bellow
I wish to add my own small voice.
The Prime Minister has not always enjoyed my support, no.
In fact, there have been times when
I've been forced to to take issue with him.
Who is that?
It's the leader of opposition.
Mr Disraeli.
But now, strangely enough,
I find myself pleading his cause.
What's he up to?
Some trickery, I wager.
By all means support this policy.
By all means rally round the Prime Minister.
By all means follow cheerfully and unquestioningly his leadership.
All of you.
Who are as anxious as he to see England reduced to the standing of a third-rate power.
Mr Disraeli's carriage.
Mr Disraeli, I must speak to you.
It's very important.
And who are you?
Ferdinand de Lesseps.
Pray get in.
The greatest danger is in delay.
I had a message this morning from
Said Pacha, the Viceroy.
The desert works fast.
Unless we can get our dredges going within the next few months all the years of work, all the millions we've spent wil be a total loss to us.
To say nothing of a far greater loss to the world.
And why have you come to me?
Because England needs the Suez Canal.
Because soon you're going to have a general election but above all, because you represent progressive and intelligent English opinion.
And think what my enemies will say.
Dizzy, the internationalist.
Dizzy, the poseur.
Dizzy, the foreigner, as they say... conspiring with a Frenchman in some evil-smelling foreign plot to undermine British institutions.
Then you will do it.
Of course I'll do it.
You've brought me a whiff of hope, monsieur.
Frankly my party's been the underdog in this election.
We haven't expected to get a majority in the House.
But I feel you've given me an issue here which dramatizes my whole stand.
Strikes at the very heart of the government's do-nothing, thumb-twiddling policy.
They see an England that stretches only from Land's End to John o'Groats, from Wales to Norfolk
A tiny island off the coast of France.
I see an England flung around the globe.
And you, a Frenchman, are doing the work
England should be doing to help create this greater England.
Monsieur, if you're willing to take a sporting chance go back to Egypt keep up your work, at least try and save what you've already done.
Raise the money somehow.
I give you my solemn promise that if my party is returned at this election
I'll do everything in my power to place England on your side.
Come, let's have some supper.
Four million piastras, Your Highness.
Your Highness, isn't this the Kompor ruby?
Yes.
It was given my father by the Sultan for defeating the Wahabi in the Arabian Campaign.
But isn't it enough for you to empty your treasury?
I know how much these heirlooms mean to you.
I wish you wouldn't, Said.
Oh, no, my friend.
Have you forgotten that sand is filling the Canal?
The banks falling in?
Machinery rusting?
See...
This is but a stone.
Yet, with it, I can buy a great future for my country.
Your bids have been dear. thirty-two... thirty-three...
Crapeau!
Four games in a row.
You're too easy.
You're too good.
René.
Hm?
Come take my place.
Give her a good beating.
With pleasure.
There is something on your mind?
Yes.
We can't hold out much longer.
Even this way.
Not making any actual progress but just keeping what we've already got.
Fighting back the desert.
And I don't whether I could even have done that without my guide, philosopher and friend.
Have I been a good secretary?
You've been a good angel.
But I've been worried about you,
Toni.
Hm?
Yes.
I've been so selfish, letting you come down here...
Oh, but I wanted to.
Yes, I know.
But you should be thinking about your own life.
Your future.
Your best years are before you.
Marriage, children...
All the things that belong to a happy, normal life.
Not tying yourself down to a lunatic with a visionary idea.
Toni...
Toni...
It's all right.
Maybe I'd rather lunatic with you. even if you don't want me in any other way.
Toni, listen to me.
You have enough troubles without me being one too.
Let's forget about it, hm?
It's quiet, isn't it?
Unnaturally quiet.
As though the whole world were standing still.
Listening, waiting for something to happen.
Look.
Ibises from the Nile.
I don't believe I've ever seen them so far from home.
I have.
Years ago in Alexandria.
The year of the Devil Wind.
Listen.
What's the matter with you?
Those were only the jackals.
Come on.
What's that?
René, go cut the animals loose.
It's our best chance.
Sargeant, go down to the encampment and get the men out.
Get ropes, brace the dredges, everything.
Yes, sir.
Come on, Toni.
We'll get the women to a place that's safe.
Get the women out and place them into the food cellars.
Get the men away from the tanks.
Come with me.
Toni.
Toni.
Toni.
We found her.
It was in the line of duty, sir.
Have you any orders for the men?
No.
Just tell them to go home.
The work's finished.
I thought I was doing such a great thing for the world.
And what have I done?
Destroyed everything I've touched.
Now Toni's gone.
For what?
For what?
Failure.
The old Viceroy was right.
If God had wanted a path through the isthmus
He would have put one there.
Goodbye, Toni.
Westminster and the City are with us.
The rest will follow.
We've had reports from everywhere but the Midlands, Mr Disraeli.
You cannot see poor towns easily
But I'm afraid when the returns from Nottingham and Birmingham come in...
Yes, I'm afraid you're right.
Apparently... the present government have temporarily averted the danger of England taking over the leadreship of the world.
It's no use crying.
There will be other elections.
I'm sorry for that poor Frenchman.
I hear he's bankrupted himself.
As well as the Viceroy of Egypt.
Counting on us to win.
Send Peterson to me, will you?
I want him to send a telegram.
Yes, Mr Disraeli.
Come in.
Lord Bainsford, sir.
Good evening.
Mr Disraeli, I have the honor to inform you that Her Majesty the Queen extends her congratulations on your party's victory in the election.
May I add my own congratulations, sir?
Thank you, Lord Bainsford.
Would you inform Her Majesty that the first thing I shall do is to put her into business as senior partner in the firm of
Victoria, de Lesseps & Company.
We are building a shorter route to Her Majesty's Eastern Empire.
A distinguished service to France and to the world.
You've won.
Yes, I've won and lost everything I'd learned to hold dear.
Perhaps that's the price one pays for fame.
And when the day comes...
I want to stand beside you and see the ships go through the canal.
I'll know you built it for all the people in the world.

Here comes Leicester.
Should I try?
- My Lord Leicester...
- Later.
Let me introduce my friend,
Hillary Vane.
Later.
Later, my Lord, may be too late.
Miss Cynthia, what have you lost?
A pearl from the Queen's. dress
- Not here.
- I heard the Queen owns 3,000 dresses.
Yes, sir, but she wants to wear the dress with pearls.
I say again, my lord Treasurer, that we neglect the Queen's safety.
There are plotters abroad.
Even now, as I came down the gallery,
I saw faces better viewed behind prisons's bars.
Keep the sprat and catch the whale.
Your pardon, Grandfather.
Your pardon, my Lord.
Me and the Earl of Leicester are in private converse, Cynthia.
What is the matter?
The Queen is furious because the Spanish ambassador is kept waiting, and there she stands in her petticoat and will only wear the French dress.
Well why not let her wear the French dress, mistress Cynthia?
A pearl is lost from the back.
From the back?
Well, she won't miss it.
No, my Lord, she has eyes in the back of her head.
Here... take this, Cynthia.
Everybody should always come to you come first!
I wish everybody thought so.
If Drake had thought of coming to you first, should we be rejoicing at the good news?
You can not mean
Drake's raid on Cadiz.
I do mean Drake's raid on Cadiz.
My Lord Leicester, see, here lies England.
But half an island.
Not 300 miles long, not 200 miles broad.
How small we are.
How wretched and defenseless.
Now turn to Spain.
In the Old World and the New.
In the Old... power.
In the New, gold.
Philip could build ten such fleets as Drake burned... and never feel the difference.
But if Spain sails across the sea to us, and burns our shipping...
How should we make it good?
You are the Lord Treasurer of England.
And that treasure is empty.
My Lords, the Queen's entering the throne room.
- My Lord, I lean only on my friends.
- The lean on!
Your Majesty breaks faith with Spain.
Ambassador, you forget yourself!
My Lord Leicester, it is you who forget yourself... the Spanish Ambassador is our guest.
Your Grace, we speak for England.
Indeed Your Grace, we do.
Who dares to speak for
England in my presence?
Answer my Lord Leicester, did you?
And you, my wise Burleigh, did you?
Be silent while then as I speak for you all.
For I am, England.
And I am the voice of Spain.
Continue, voice of Spain.
My master, His Majesty King Philip...
He introduces me to my own brother in law.
Reassure your master.
My sister Mary, the late Queen, was his loving wife and for her sake
I am his loving sister.
His portrait is still hanging on a place of honor.
My King doesn’t ask Your Grace to hang his picture.
But to hang his enemies.
Just this month, English pirates have destroyed some 7,000 tons of our shipping.
Names?
What do I know of their names?
They come and go like wasps... led always by the arch-pirate "El Draco".
Sir Francis Drake sailed around the world and I knighted him for it.
Now he's haunting Spain, and I am to hang him for it!
No.
If I hang Drake, tomorrow twenty other Drakes will take his place.
How can I hold them back when your King sends my honest merchants to the Inquisition to be burned alive?
Your Grace can at least forbid them to leave England.
England is a large island very many ports.
I will not sit at each and wait like a cat at the mouse hole
But I could spend free leave to punish my Drake and his captains... if Spain can.
Majesty!
I say, my Lord, "If Spain can."
If Your Majesty will not hear words, we must come to cannons!
And see if you will hear them.
If you use threats of that kind
I will kick you out of my kingdom.
But Your Grace, you must listen.
"Must"?
Little man, little man...
"Must" is not a word to use to princes.
Our Council shall confer with you.
Meanwhile, go home and be quiet.
Leicester.
- I have been too bold.
- It was needed.
If once the Spaniards think that we are afraid...
Invasion.
Night and day it drums in my ear, invasion, invasion, invasion.
I'm afraid.
So that is why you disavowed Drake.
Disavow you call it?
That gentleman cares not if
I should disavow him.
It is a private agreement that we have.
I was not told.
Must I tell you everything, jealous Robin?
When we were children I served you.
When the Queen your sister sent you to the tower...
But he is Philip of Spain...
Still I served you and was trusted.
But today, though I serve...
And love...
I am not trusted!
Do not deceive yourself.
I know you love me and will risk your life for me.
But these men risk more than their mere life.
Once they're caught...
I can not help them and they know it.
Once they're caught, it is death by fire.
But that does not stop them from dying for me.
They still cry...
God save the Queen!
Death to the King of Spain, brave boys!
Come on you there, die for the King!
Come on!
Come on!
Richard Ingolby.
Richard!
Miguel!
Father, he knows you!
We were friends once.
Enemies now!
I wish we had never met.
Why, sir?
Because you've beaten us?
But as long as we're your prisoners, sir, it's a sort of holiday.
That's right, dear lad.
We're safe enough.
Miguel... is it not possible to spare the boy?
I can do nothing.
It's each for himself, sink or swim.
Richard, you hear me?
Sink or... swim.
Michael.
You are the Queen's servant.
Yes, of course.
I'm now going to give you her orders.
You climb up on the rail.., dive... swim for shore.
When you are on land, make for the home of Don Miguel, he will help if he can.
Leave you here?
I had rather die.
I have friends in Spain.
I'm safe enough.
Once you're in England, go to the Queen.
I will not leave!
Obey me, Michael.
In the name of the Inquisition.
Father!
- Dona Elena!
- Father came!
But you can not go downstairs in your night gear.
She's mad!
Ah, poor child, she had an English nurse and she's never got over it.
A mannerless woman who opened all the windows.
Dad!
Elena!
They said you'd never get ashore tonight!
Admiral.
Doña Elena, you must come back to your room at once.
Please tell the servants to prepare a meal for me.
First Doña Elena must retire!
I am not going back to bed yet.
What did I hear you say?
I am not going back to bed yet.
I want to hear about the fight!
Let her remain, Señora.
If you say so, Admiral, you are her father.
But for the future, Señorita, remember this:
A Spanish lady may retire, but she never goes to bed.
Listen to me, Elena.
You're not a child anymore.
A child?
When I'm going to be married in three months?
The captain of the
English vessel, is Richard Ingolby.
Your friend... long ago... in England.
A friend... from long ago...
My best friend.
And I've handed him over to the military authorities... and they will hand him over to the Inquisition.
And you know what that will mean.
Father...
But he has an only son, Elena.
I've reported him drowned.
But I do not think that he is drowned.
I think that he will reach the shore and come to us for help.
What is he like?
Fair or dark?
He could pass for a Spaniard.
And he speaks Spanish.
So if he does come...
But we mustn't help a heretic!
Besides, father, the danger!
But nobody will know!
But they will!
I can give work to a beggar if I choose.
He's only a boy, Elena.
But an enemy of Spain!
What is it?
There's somebody outside.
Is this the English heretic?
Elena!
Poor boy!
The Queen sent me to have you this...
Why does she always call you
"spirit," grandfather?
Continue!
A letter from her desk, a cordial from her cupboard, and a message from her heart.
Repeat the message.
She says: "I entreat Heaven daily for your longer life... else would I and my people stand in need of cordial all."
She is my cordial.
Vinegar for the rest of us.
She gave me a cuff this morning.
No doubt you earned it!
I was only humming a tune!
Michael's tune.
But she ordered me off to you with those letters and I was not to come back until you'd read them.
"Will you hear of a Spanish Lady...
"how she wooed an Englishman...
"Garments gay, rich as may be she had on...
"comely was her countenance...
Oh, gad... does your gout trouble you so?
Sir Richard Ingolby has been captured by the Spaniards.
He is held by the Inquisition.
And Michael?
There's no word here of Michael.
"Will you hear of a Spanish Lady...
"how she wooed an Englishman...
I said you could not do it.
Now, listen.
"Will you hear of a Spanish Lady...
"how she wooed an Englishman...
"garments gay, rich as may be she had on...
"comely was her countenance...
"high was her degree...
"smiling...
"sighing...
"full of grace was she.
"Will you hear a Spanish Lady...
"how she wooed an Englishman...
How I came to a Spanish Lady...
"loved an English man.
- Why do you want a fire?
- I'm cooking.
What?
A treat for you.
What is it?
They call it... a potato.
It's a kind of food, very rare.
Is that safe to eat?
Father has eaten one.
He says he never felt better in his life.
You bake them.
It takes an hour.
I'm glad it takes an hour.
I never see you nowadays.
Well, I'm very busy.
You forget I'm going to be married.
Besides... you only think of getting home to your Cynthia.
I expect she's married by now.
She won't be.
How do you know?
I know.
What are you staring at?
It's over Lisbon.
What?
Smoke, look!
So thick you can hardly see the roofs.
It's just smoke.
Michael.
Your shoulder has healed at last, eh?
Yes, thank to you, sir.
Thank to Elena.
I gave you the hurt, she mended it.
Michael, I'm to hurt you again.
But this wound will not heal so quickly.
Sir?
I have a message from your father.
At last!
Where is he?
Where is he?
His last words to me were:
"It isn't our quarrel... it isn't the Queen's quarrel.
"It's a war of ideas.
The boy will understand that one day.
"Tell him...
You can't burn ideas".
But when did he say that to you?
On my ship, the night you escaped.
Then you have not seen him since?
I saw him today.
What did he say to you?
He was gagged.
What?
Did you not see the smoke, Michael, blow in from Lisbon market place?
Smoke...
An execution.
My poor boy...
Get away from me!
- You Spanish devils!
- Michael!
And you knew too!
You let me talk and laugh...
- while my father...
- Michael!
Get away from me!
If only you knew how I loathe you all!
Your Spanish faces, your Spanish voices...
And you fed me, haven't you?
And you clothed me!
You made me your household pet, but you burned my father!
And I have to be grateful to you!
Grateful!
Michael, how dare you!
You couldn't know, for you were sick...
And now for once I know it!
I'm going now to take all my father's place!
But I haven't finished his message!
He said: "My son will hardly forgive me for deceiving him."
"He'll never forgive you."
"When his first grief is over, tell him...
I can not bear anymore!
Leave him alone.
It's all you can do for him.
We now come to the scandalous business of Drake's latest capture.
Scandalous?
I talked to the Spanish Ambassador... and I confess he may well complain.
When the Spaniards took the New World, they sent home the San Philip... the San Philip, my Lords, is the greatest treasure ship the Old World ever saw...
Drake captures... ship and treasure... and tows all home to Plymouth.
Scandalous indeed!
And now I have to report that the San
Philip has fetched in the open market...
114,000 pounds...
Of which the Crown takes forty thousand...
Fifty!
Write down fifty thousand.
Your Majesty intends to accept this money?
It should be more!
Well... so long as the crew gets it's share... fif... sixty thousand.
Your Majesty then returns the money to Spain!
Return?
We are not yet at war with Spain... but we shall be if we do not return this plunder.
If Drake had not seized the San Philip... the Armada would have sailed by now.
But it has not sailed, my lord... and we are at peace with Spain.
Either we disown the capture of the San Philip or...
Or?
Your Majesty returns the money... and hangs the good Sir Francis.
Her Grace shall not so humble herself.
My Lords, let us face facts.
Why is the Armada being built?
To invade England!
But If we strike now...
Ay, strike or be struck!
- If we strike first...
- We can not strike.
We have no brigs.
Burleigh, you croak like an old raven.
You and I have kept the peace thirty years.
Do not pleases you to croak war?
A young raven, new loose from the Spanish ark.
Well, young raven...
My, if they have not trimmed your feathers!
He has sailed from
Lisbon, Your Grace, in fishing boat, single handed.
What is your name?
Michael Ingolby.
Where is my ship and where is your father?
Both lost, Your Grace.
How lost?
By fire.
Boy... your father was ever ready to love me and serve me.
I'm in grief for your loss...
And for mine.
Gentlemen, give us leave for a little.
Come.
Father explained, they heard souls as we heard cattle.
All men must be of one pattern and one blood.
Spain is the prison of all freedom.
Spain is horror!
- Spain is...
- Shhh!
But who will listen if you do not?
You are the world's hope, my father said so.
His last word to me was: "Tell the Queen...
"Tell the Queen, Michael...
How can I?
I thought I could once in Spain...
I thought if I had but the chance...
But home again...
I can not.
How you can you, Queen here in free England... understand the danger.
Tell me, Michael, how big is their Armada?
I could never learn the numbers.
How many troops?
No one knows.
Their Armada will consists of 132 ships... it will carry 20,000 sailors, besides guns.
Your Grace has made a fool of me.
Blame nature lad, not me.
Will Your Grace give me leave to go?
If you can not endure to be laughed at, boy, how shall you endure a harder service?
Do you no longer wish to serve me?
Tell me how.
For the first change your cloth.
It stinks of fish!
Thus we learn.
Michael!
Michael.
- Sweetheart!
- My dear!
My darling!
Mistress!
This is my palace, not your private parlor.
Lord Leicester's dines with me.
Change my dress and my clothes now!
I'll come back!
The wrong shoe!
Thee wrong foot.
Where're your thoughts, girl?
In my head, Madam.
Crooked answers, crooked answers!
Yes, Madam.
For crooked questions.
My wig.
Your Grace!
Do you like what you see in the glass?
Ay, Madam.
How old are you?
Eighteen.
When I was eighteen,
I was a prisoner in the Tower.
Fetch me the Earl of Leicester.
And do not loiter!
This mirror is old and blemished!
- Shall I fetch another, Your Grace?
- No, I know what you think.
- I think nothing, Madam.
- You do, you do!
You know that the Queen’s face is blemished, not the mirror.
Well, fetch me my disguise.
I had forgotten.
Me?
That you were so beautiful.
I too had forgotten.
Me?
That you were so tall.
Such hollow cheeks... so... swarthy.
Spain is a land of ghosts.
This is home.
Home, Michael.
Who gave the wench leave to mount my throne?
And where is the Earl of Leicester?
- Madam, I forgot!
- Forgot?
The state waits while a flaunting flibbertigibbet sits in the Queen's seat and lets an insolent boy flatter her?
Am I to wait your leisure?
Your Grace, the loved Lord knows whether I'm on my head or my heels.
You do not know?
Your Grace, it was all my doing.
- Do not cry, Cynthia.
- Leave her all alone!
I'll teach you two to know me better.
You kept me waiting on your pleasure, and now you shall wait upon mine, go!
- Your Grace...
- Go and be hanged!
Your dear Majesty has frightened two bairns out of their little wits.
The girl is a minx.
But the youth...
He is such a tall lad... as you were, Robin... when all the world was young.
My dear...
Nay my lord, springtime is over.
What is your autumn wish?
Your signature.
You had less tame wishes once.
They were never granted.
And now only wish for my 60,000 pounds to spend on Burleigh's fleet.
Sign those, dear Majesty... and you are safe against Spain.
See here, Robin...
I have written out for me another paper returning the money to Philip.
Without consulting the Council?
The Council!
But the boy's talk shook me.
He is a handsome youth.
You do well to be jealous!
He's stronger than you.
You are... today.
He is tomorrow.
Lord Amberley, writes that you wish for a license to travel.
Why?
To see the world, my Lord.
What part of the world?
Paris, Rome...
Madrid?
Why should I go to Madrid?
Shall I tell you?
I should be glad to hear!
To give the King of Spain news of his English friends.
Why, Mr. Vane, you have no color in your face.
Have you been ill?
That's why my doctor recommends travel.
Mr. Vane, that is not the reason.
We know because we have read them, this letters passed between you and certain Spaniards.
There was no harm!
Why should the King of Spain invite you to Madrid?
Tell me why, and I will myself beg the
Queen to grant your license.
The Queen would be merciful to a men who confesses his follies... and those of his friends.
Come, be open with me.
I will not cheat you.
I have nothing to confess.
I do not understand your Lordship.
Your application will be considered.
Goodbye, Mr. Vane.
Good day, my lord.
Did you know that gentleman?
- Mr. Vane?
- Mr. Hillary Vane.
It is very likely he will try to leave the country.
Your business is to prevent him.
By force?
If need be.
But at all costs, he is to be taken alive.
The French ambassador has arrived, my Lord.
Has the Queen returned from hunting?
Not yet.
It's late!
Has she read my petition to rejoin the fleet?
Do you think she will let me go?
Why not?
Because he likes you.
Did you speak for me?
I didn’t dare.
She's still upset with me.
Why?
Because she likes you.
Michael!
You?
At least you've learned not to loiter.
Fools, can't you see that it's a woman?
Who set you on to killing me?
Which Queen are you?
There is but one Queen, woman.
There were once two cousins.
The Queen of England and the Queen of Scots.
The English Queen put my
Queen of Scots to death.
Now I have no Queen to serve.
She's crazy, else she would not dare.
Give me the pistol.
Not loaded.
Let her go.
The will stone me!
Where are your friends?
In France.
You shall be given safe-conducts and money to take you there.
Take her in your charge.
Be content.
No harm has come to me.
Your arm.
Alive... unhurt... oh most dear!
Let me sit down.
Lord Robin...
It was a sin to take life of kind Mary of Scotland.
Not sin of yours, her life was forfeit.
I could have saved her, but I let her perish.
Well, I pay for it.
Five times, Robin, I have stood to be shot dead.
Yet still I live.
Thank God Your Majesty is safe.
Your gout, I will not have you kneel.
We use you not for your bad leg, but with your good head.
A chair!
The King of France will rejoice at Your Grace's most happy escape.
My Master also will rejoice that your gracious life was not in danger.
- Not he in danger?
- The pistol was not loaded.
But Your Grace's alarm is natural.
A woman's fear...
Four years ago the noble Prince of Orange was shot dead on his own doorstep.
And I...
I know of loaded pistols.
And so, Your Grace', does he!
- Your Majesty!
- Boy, be silent!
Your Grace, this Spaniard plots against you.
- Slander!
- Slander? Then your own people slander you.
In Spain it is common talk that
England is full of traitors whom you have sworn to service.
- What service?
- Why, to kill the Queen!
Names?
How could I learn names?
But one day Your Grace, the pistol will be loaded.
And as the shot echoes across the sea to Spain, the Armada will sail!
And then there will be fire over England.
Flames, torments!
- He's beside himself.
- I'm not!
Then you are a fool and a hothead.
Avoid my presence!
Enough, Burleigh.
You must forgive him, your Excellency.
His father's ashes have blown into his eyes and blinded him.
You had better get away as soon as you can.
Mr. Vane, you're under arrest.
You'll not take me alive!
Well, what are you going to do?
Why should I tell you?
So that you can prevent me?
I would rather help you.
Ah, the old lads telling us what to do!
I am very tired.
In a few years, I shall be asleep forever.
Why should I care what you young people do?
Then why do you swat and hamper us?
I am an upper servant in an old house.
So is the Queen.
So is Leicester.
We have spent our lives... dusting. polishing.
Dull work.
But we have learned to take a pride in the house.
And our task in our old age is to train the new servants.
The house boys... the kitchen maids... that one day will take our places.
I wonder why we do it.
We get no thanks.
- My Lord, I did not intend...
- I can not teach you to be a hero.
I'm only a servant myself.
And service is too tame for you.
Pity.
- My lord...
- Oh, go away.
- My lord...
- Oh, chatter somewhere else.
Grandfather, the Queen is asking for you!
You are to come quickly, and quicker still.
Will you take my arm, sir?
I can still totter.
There, grandchild, is the man who requires your support.
You gave orders!
You gave orders!
You get who should be taken and who'll go free!
By gad, my Lord, if you think you rule here, you will soon know better.
Burleigh...
Vane is dead!
Dead? How?
Killed in resisting arrest.
But I gave orders...
My orders were that he should not be touched!
But this fool takes it upon him to overrule my orders!
Do you not understand, my Lord, that we wished Vane visit to Philip?
And when he would return stuffed with Philip's plots, then... then we should have taken him?
Well, I was afraid foe her life, I...
Oh, I'm assured of your dutiful thoughts!
Did they get Vane's papers?
No, he leapt over the boat's side and the tide swept him away.
Waste, waste, waste.
Wherein have I failed?
Robin... do you think that dammed fellow was indeed a traitor?
I know it!
I know a youngster who is not traitor.
You don't understand.
I understand very well!
Your loyalty asks to pay for everyone's mistakes.
But I won't let you.
If the Queen sends you home in disgrace
I'll come with you and be disgraced too.
Dear... and foolish.
Why foolish?
You love me, don't you?
Well... settled?
I can't.
Michael!
I can't!
We have a right to be happy!
Everyone's the right to be happy, Michael!
Everyone, yes.
That is why we can't. be.
The last time I watched a fire fall to pieces was the day my father...
Elena and I were laughing.
And then the smoke began to drift across the bay.
Michael.
Michael!
Yes, dear, of course, we a right to be happy.
Husband and wife sitting by the fire listening to the crackles... and thinking of what they did to him.
I shall make you forget it.
I shall!
The smoke drifted right over us.
And now it's drifting over England.
Unless we stop it.
Oh, Cynthia, help me to stop it.
I'll help you.
How?
Come away, Michael.
She would like you to come away Michael, to your home and herd.
And I do not blame her for dreaming.
But it is not service.
What is service?
First obedience.
I will obey you.
Then, Michael, give me what I want.
I will give Your Majesty my life.
Would you?
Would you give me your silly young life?
Dear lad.
Then I will tell you some news.
Vane, who was on his treacherous way to Philip's court, is dead.
But it is known to none.
He was of your height, not much older...
And I speak Spanish.
Well?
Could you take Vane's part?
This is madness!
Why should he risk his life, twice?
Dear, be quiet.
No let her speak, you love her.
It is fit that you should ask her leave.
I love her... but I will not ask any girl's leave to do what I must.
Not if I order it?
Michael!
Michael, speak to me out of your own heart not because she bid you,
Must you go?
If you are killed, Michael, there will be so many years without you.
I shall grow old... fifty years without you, Michael, think of it!
Fifty springs, summers, winters.
Must you go?
Then you go with my free leave.
Lord Burleigh will order your journey.
Luck go with you!
I have no more to say to you till you return.
Girl...
- Your Grace?
- Where do you go?
I'll do but seek some... merciful corner to cry in.
Cry here.
The money... and the licence to travel.
The license not granted to Hillary Vane.
He was on his way to Philip when he died.
And took his secrets with him.
- Secrets?
- The names.
We know the plot against the Queen but do not the plotters' names.
And Philip knows them.
None but Philip.
- I'll get those names.
- How?
I do not know, my Lords.
But I know that if I do not get those names for you,
I will never see England again.
Make up the fire.
This hottest of days?
I'm always cold.
A cordial, Sire?
No wine warms.
How many letters have I answered?
Your Majesty has this morning written 40 letters by your own hand and dictated nine dispatches.
I will continue.
Sire, is it not time to rest?
Not in this world.
Who remains to be seen?
Admiral Valdez, newly arrived from Lisbon, he awaits instructions concerning the Armada.
- Who else?
- Mr. Vane, from England.
Admit the Admiral.
Employ rigorous miens.
Only by fear can the people be made to...
Admiral, I am satisfied with your report.
And the Armada sails?
A month from this day.
If the Englishman confirms our hopes.
Admit Mr. Vane.
Continue.
Only by fear can the people be made to do their duty.
And not always then.
Your Majesty... on behalf of all your devoted adherents in England
I... I...
Compose yourself.
You are welcome to Spain.
Get up and deliver me your letters.
I am the letter, Sire.
We dare not commit our plans to paper.
- But Lord Amberley says here...
- Ah, ah, but...
Mr. Vane, you must not interrupt His Majesty.
Let him go on,
I know the English.
I only wish to say, Sir... that my Lord Amberley wrote... before the attempt on the Queen's life.
What?
It was not attempted by ours.
- A poor lunatic...
- Is the Queen hurt?
Untouched.
But there is now such watchfulness at court... that we all, and my Lord Amberley in particular... favour a delay.
More delays?
Only until the Armada reaches the Channel.
In the confusion the Queen should be easier to attack.
Wait.
Now, sir, the plan.
Sir, in the audience chamber at Greenwich...
I remember that audience chamber.
Always draughty when the wind was in the East.
Yes, Sir... because, sir, behind the tapestry there is a passage... walled up since the old King's days...
But some of us have secretly taken down the brickwork...
Some of you?
How many of you attend the Queen?
My Lord Amberley, always, and... and myself until a month ago.
Does Sir Humphrey Cooper attend?
Sir Humphrey's absence hardly affects the situation, Sir.
What is the plan?
Why, to spirit the Queen's out of the palace by way of the passage.
Where would you take her?
To Sir Humphrey Cooper's.
Surely he lives in the North!
Ay, but he has an empty house in the Essex's marshes.
The Essex's marshes...
It would be easy to send a boat over from Holland.
I will consider your scheme.
Count...
I commit Mr. Vane to your charge.
Accompany him to the Governor's apartments.
And see to it that his stay with us is a pleasant one.
Your Majesty,
I most humbly thank...
Compose yourself.
Well, Admiral?
I do not understand this blunt Englishman.
I lived a year with Englishmen.
I hated everyone of them.
And how it rained!
But we must use the tools that Providence sends us, Admiral.
Blunt though they be.
It is a good scheme, my Sire.
Yes... it is a good scheme... if he is honest.
Your first visit to Spain?
And my first view of the Escorial.
Very impressive.
But I shall inevitably loose my way in all these bewildering galleries and corridors.
In that case, always ask to be sent to prison.
- To prison?
- Now we have alarmed him!
As governor of the palace, my official quarters are of course connected with the prison.
So you see, you must be careful, Mr. Vane.
Oh, I will.
His Majesty has already made me shake in my shoes.
- What did he say?
- Compose yourself!
Elena!
Spain and England under one King.
- Think of it!
- Oh, we do!
All England waiting for salvation.
All England watching the Channel.
- Waiting.
- That's it!
Just waiting.
Pedro!
Admiral Valdez has just come.
He's going to stay with us, he promises he will.
- My dear Admiral!
- Oh, Don Escobal!
Who is?
My dear, allow me to present His
Majesty's guest from England...
Mr. Hillary Vane.
My dear... talk to your guest from England.
I...
I have to talk to you.
You come from home.
My dear, how you do remind me of your father!
You speak of Don Miguel de Casanz, Admiral?
I didn't know that you've met my father at all, Mr. Vane.
I have heard his praises sound so often at home.
He made many friends in England.
It is hard for me to remember that now.
Have I...?
My father in law was killed two months ago.
Killed, by English pirates.
I'm deeply distressed to hear this.
Are you?
Why?
You are English.
Elena!
I know no full of vanity than this... to kiss and hate... to kiss and love...
To kiss.
Charming!
Charming! Charming!
Charming.
Then you approve of our
Spanish love songs?
I find them disturbing.
Ours English songs are lighter.
More heartless.
That's a challenge!
Am I to accept it?
If you dare.
Dare!
"As the holly growes green...
"And never changes that hue...
"So am I - ever have been - unto my lady true.
Pathetic show of me!
Who wrote it?
King Henry VIII.
That monster who beheaded all his wives?
How could he?
But love often turns to hate, doesn't it Countess?
I dare say, when it is rewarded by shamelessness!
What's that you are playing now?
One of our English ballads.
They call it
"The Spanish Lady's Love."
"Will you hear of a Spanish Lady...
"how she saved an Englishman...
"Garments gay, rich as may be she had on...
"comely was her countenance...
"high was her degree...
"smiling...
"sighing...
"full of grace was she.
"Will you hear of a Spanish Lady...
"how she saved an Englishman...
How I turned to a Spanish Lady...
"saved an English man.
And now let me propose a toast!
Gentlemen, I give you the loveliness of Spain.
An ingenious toast.
It's wine!
It's music!
It's women.
I had no idea Englishmen were so gallant.
A thousand apologies!
I have been with the King until this moment.
Does His Majesty ever stop working?
Stop working?
Not to my knowledge.
I shouldn't be surprised, Mr. Vane, if you found yourself on your way back to England before dawn.
I've never known His Majesty to decide a matter so quickly.
You are to be congratulated.
There are few who succeed in hurrying our prudent King.
Then let us drink. gentlemen, to your prudent King.
- The King!
- The King!
Prudence is of course a virtue that we English lack.
You put audacity in it's place?
Do you despise audacity?
It dazzled me, once... but I have since learned to admire other qualities in a man.
Such as?
Unselfishness... consideration for others... all that is implied by...
Prudence!
My friends!
Drink to the prudent, who think as the state thinks... who believes as the state believes... who loves and hates with prudence... and dies prudently... when it is no longer safe to live... and lies snug at last in prudence's grave.
Gentlefolk of Spain, I give you the prudent's face.
And may England...
You can guess my wishes, gentlemen, for England.
Yes... speak out your wishes.
Ah, yes!
Let us now drink to the success of our guest's mission.
To the end of... of heresy!
To the invincible Armada!
To the destruction of Elisabeth!
You, you do not drink?
My glass is empty.
To the salvation of England.
Did you cut your hands?
Nothing.
Elena.
No, Michael.
Elena, please.
I must tell my husband who you are.
You know I must.
The King must know.
I can't let you betray Spain.
I'm only fighting for my own people.
And I for mine.
Then why did you say nothing when we met?
You had only to say this is
Michael Ingolby, a runaway prisoner.
Why did you keep my secret?
I remembered you.
Dear...
Dearest Elena.
Why are there wars?
Why must I be torn in two?
It isn't wrong to be found of you.
Father... he was too.
Darling.
I kept your secret till
I could speak to you.
But now I must give you up to them.
Kiss me first.
No.
It's just goodbye.
The last time we forgot to say goodbye.
Goodbye...
Michael.
Somebody is coming.
It's Pedro!
Then tell him now.
What could be more prudent?
You are are cruel!
Helena.
I can enjoy my
Spanish moonlight.
So I perceived.
The moonlight in this country is best enjoyed alone.
Why have you left your guests?
Answer me!
What happened just now?
You told me to talk to him, you said I'd been rude.
Did I tell you to walk alone with him on the terrace?
There was no harm, we were just saying goodbye.
In private?
Why are you so angry?
I shall never see him again.
Again?
Where you've seen him before?
- Nowhere.
- And why did you...
You have seen him before.
What is this mystery?
Who is this man who you insult in public...
- and yet, in private, you...
- No, no, Pedro, you're wrong.
- Well?
- I had the right!
Give me the copy of Mr. Vane's instructions and the letters.
Sir James Todd...
Lord Illingworth...
Sir Humphrey Cooper...
Mr. Joseph Madison...
Lord Amberley... and, of course, Mr. Laurence Gregory.
Ah, Mr. Vane!
Mr. Vane...
You will leave for England tonight.
Your Majesty...
I have not finished.
I have written for you the necessary letters of authorization.
The ink is still wet.
Sand it for me.
Allow me!
That is the sand... that the ink.
Your pardon.
Copy the letter again.
Meanwhile, I will outline for you the modifications
I desire to make in your plan.
Having secured the Queen's person...
Your father must have been beside himself.
- An enemy here...
- He wasn't an enemy.
He was just Michael, we were fond of him.
Fond of him?
The wife of the
Governor of the Palace has failed to disclose the presence of an enemy.
Is the King to be said that she meant no harm and she was fond of him?
I hope to deserve
Your Majesty's trust.
Trust?
I do not trust you, sir.
I do not trust any man.
If the Count of Carmenar is with us, fetch him.
But you have convinced me that you believe that your welfare depends upon obeying me... and you are right!
I reward those whom I... within reason, trust.
Upon your arrival in England, you will of course immediately get in touch with...
Sir James Tallerton...
And?
My Lord Amberley...
Mr. Joseph Madison.
And?
Sir Humphrey Cooper...
Lord Illingworth.
And?
And?
Tallerton, Amberley...
Madison, Cooper...
- Illingworth...
- And?
And?
My memory.
He... he's my oldest friend!
The name is on the tip of my tongue...
No... gone!
- He will laugh when I tell him.
- And?
Tallerton, Amberley, Madison,
Cooper, Illingworth.
Tallerton, Amberley, Madison,
Cooper, Illingworth.
And Mr. Laurence Gregory.
Count, you will place this gentleman under arrest.
This way.
Your sword.
Keep your dagger.
You will need your dagger, Mr. Ingolby.
Elena who's told you?
My wife told me a piece of folly so inconceivable...
Walk on.
We may be watched.
Do you realize what will happen to my wife if she is known to have helped a heretic?
It will never be known trough to me.
You English fool, you'll be persuaded to tell everything.
We understand persuasion.
Walk on.
You force me to choose between betraying my country or my wife.
I'm obliged to help you.
The only chance is to escape now before news of your arrest are spread through the palace.
At the end of this gallery...
I'll hand you over to the captain of the guard...
Then, without scruples, use the dagger.
And be shot down for my pain.
My dear Count, that will be very convenient.
I regret the risk, you must take it!
If...
I say if, you are adroit enough to escape in the confusion... it will be to my interest to create a confusion to delay the chase.
Make to the stables.
If you could secure a horse before the alarm is given... why, then you have a... slender chance.
Captain!
You will escort this gentleman to the prison.
I shall examine him tomorrow.
Adiós, senõr.
Adiós, Count.
Captain!
At your service, Count.
If at any time the prisoner should show sign of plotting an escape, he is to be shot down.
- Understood?
- Understood.
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Mr. Vane!
Is the fire is serious?
They are getting it under.
I don't think we can do anything.
Are you leaving us tonight?
Yes, His Majesty has been most gracious.
I was just about to try to find my horse.
I've arranged that!
Thank you.
I have to slip away as unobtrusively as possible.
Oh, evidently, but does His Majesty...
You can trust me!
Thank you!
I'm ready,
I am very much obliged to you...
I should never have got away without your good offices.
I'm rather surprised His Majesty hasn't assigned you an escort.
I prefer to travel lightly.
Yes, one likes to be free!
Yet, sir, at the moment it is most essential to hurry.
We... we... we shall meet again in Lisbon!
Yes!
You'll do find us waiting for you!
Adiós!
A very pleasant fellow.
At long last Michael is saved... and you are not angry.
No, not angry, my dearest!
But you must grow up.
You see Elena, the whole trouble comes from treating your enemies like human beings.
Don't you see, my dear, that if you do that they cease to be enemies?
Think of what that leads to.
It's the end of patriotism.
It's the end of the war.
It's the end of... of everything!
Now, do you see?
I see.
The Armada!
The Armada!
The Armada!
The Armada!
The Armada!
Where are my spirits?
I've come to bid you goodbye.
I'm for Tilbury.
Your Grace should stay in London.
Your Grace will not take my advice?
I can't.
Nor the Council's advice?
The Council's a pack of cowards.
The army is at Tilbury and Leicester writes me... here, listen.
May it please you to come for this army and people... by spending two or three days in the camp.
So now comfort me, Burleigh,
And wish me good luck.
- Is this your supper?
- Not now, not now.
Why not now?
A good English broth.
Your Majesty's kindness.
Keep your breath to cool your porridge.
Come, one more spoonful.
Now I must go.
Take care of him, child.
Your Grace!
Your Grace is there to have no news?
Of the Armada?
Of Michael.
I have no comfort for you.
Do you think he will come back?
I'm not providence!
But what does Your Grace think?
I've seen blackest fears turn to hopes.
Hope on till you know there is none.
My people.
I have come to live or die amongst you all.
To lay down for my God, and for my kingdom... and for my people my honor and my blood, even in the dark.
I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman...
But I have the heart and valor of a King.
And of a King of England too.
Not Spain nor any prince of Europe shall dare to invade the borders of my realm.
Wake up your hearts!
By your peace in camp and your valor in the field
Will shall shortly have a famous victory!
Who should keep my subjects from me?
Well, loiterer?
Majesty...
News from Spain,.
Come!
Mr. Gregory.
Summon to me here my Lord Amberley... my Lord Illingworth...
Sir Humphrey Cooper,
Sir James Tallerton...
Mr. Madison...
And you come back.
You have done more than well.
You can ask and have.
She knows everything, everything!
It's better if we face it out, or do we run for it?
- Run where?
- Once the Spaniards land...
You’ll be hanged by then!
You have done enough.
Not while the Spaniards are in the channel.
You said ask and have, let me join the ships.
Your Grace...
The gentlemen are waiting.
Your place is with those others, and you know it!
Go!
What is wrong here?
Robin, I need your sword.
- My sword?
- Yes.
Here in my hand.
Kneel, Michael.
Rise up.
Rise up, Sir Michael Ingolby.
Your Grace!
Your Grace.
I rise up and I cast down.
Wait here.
Words will not count.
Hear that?
She is...
She is...
She is the Queen.
The greatest joy of my lifetime has been to serve her.
And so will you find it.
You, sirs... you have plotted to kill me.
Well, here I stand.
Will you still sway your swords?
Men use them better!
But let the King of Spain call you servants, when I call you...
Sons?
Your Grace!
Ay, sons, though your lives are forfeit.
How will you die?
In sunlight or in darkness?
For a free world, or a world where your thoughts are rationed like prison food?
Choose, for the enemy is upon us.
God save the Queen!
God save the Queen!
Sir Michael Ingolby, come here!
Michael, I will give you a command.
You shall fight fire with fire.
These men shall fight under you for their souls' salvation.
Gentlemen...
Dear Michael...
If you took seven little ships and tarred them... and piled them with firewood... and so sailed them single-handed against the greatest fleet the world has ever known...
If you wield not swords in your hands, but torches!
Thou didst blow with thy wind... and they were scattered.
Peace!
Till next time.
No next time...
The Armada was scattered to the four winds.
And now the bells begin to ring.
Your Grace must rest!
No time, Robin.
For now come the rewards, and the knighting, and all the happy people.
And the blind... who will never see again.
And the maimed men... and the men with youth gone out of them.
Some men will still have youth left.
Listen to our wedding bells.
The woman's point of view!
Every steeple in England rocks for joy... and my granddaughter says...
"It's because I'm getting married"
So at last they are to marry!
I allow it.
They shall not stay at court.
I don't know married folk at my court.
Yet, I'm a married man.
Oh, fool you.
You may go.
And come again?
Come and go.
Will come and go.
Yes, it's old and tarnished.
I will have no more mirrors in any room of mine.
My loving... people.
Let us give thanks.
Almighty God...
Father of all mercy...
We, Thine unworthy servants...
We give Thee our most humble and hearty thanks!

- Hold it! Where're you going?
- The Czechs've taken the farmstead.
- The Czechs? Where's your rifle?
- Back there.
- Where's your rifle?
- Vassily Ivanovich, Comrade Commander,
I've lost it in the river when we fled the farmstead. - Find it.
And where's your machine-gun,
Pastukhov?
I've hidden it by the river, right on the bank.
Thank you for the farmstead, fighters.
As for your rifles, I'll personally check up on all of you tonight.
Fall out!
- My name's Furmanov. Appointed a commissar to your division. - I know.
That's the weavers, our volunteers.
So you're here?
Yes, we're here.
Are you a machine-gunner?
Can be a machine-gunner too. Why?
You're just in time. We've got an order from Mikhail Frunze:
Tomorrow we're assuming the offensive.
What are they doing there?
Taking a swim. It's too hot.
Quiet, folks! Chapay needs to think.
Pugachev's regiment attacks at mid- night... Razin's stays in the reserve.
So, by 9 a.m. We'll take the village of Lomikhinskaya.
- What d'ye think, Yelan? - I think a blow on the right flank is better.
And what does the Commissar think?
I think...
My opinion is...
The Commander's already taken the decision and I think it's right.
Everything you said here is to be spit on and forgotten.
Now listen to my command:
We attack on both flanks.
Cross the river only by the bridge.
It will hold. I've checked it.
We begin attacking at 5 a.m. Sharp.
And we'll go by way...
The village has been taken.
- Wounded? - I am, Vassily Ivanovich.
- Stupid.
You're the only brigade commander, my military deputy.
You have no right to expose yourself to stupid bullets.
- The bullet doesn't think who's commander and who... - It doesn't, but you must think.
Haven't you got brains?
Come here.
For example, a detachment is on the march.
Where's the commander supposed to be?
At the head, on his dashing horse.
The enemy showed up and opened cannon fire.
Where's the commander supposed to be?
He can be at the head again, because they wouldn't fire from cannons at one man.
Now the enemy opened gunfire.
Where's the commander supposed to be?
Suppose they have 10 machine-guns here, and two here. Where?
- Where The ten are.
- The ten... Can't you think?
It's easier to kill you where the ten are. So you must be where the two are.
Otherwise, without a commander, it'll be the end of his men too.
Now the enemy is attacking.
Where's the commander supposed to be?
- At the head. - He must go to the rear of his detachment and watch the whole scene of the battle from some vantage point.
Otherwise his detachment's flanks may be turned.
Now, thanks to the decisive actions of the detachment and its commander, the enemy's been beaten off and made to flee.
Our detachment is harrying the enemy that retreats in panic.
Where's the commander supposed to be?
At the head again, on his horse.
He has to be the first to burst into town on his enemy's shoulders.
Use your brains!
You're such a liar, Vassily Ivanovich.
If need be, you're always at the head.
Well, if need be.
This is called "back plate".
And this is called "cheeks".
And what's that called?
Back plate... Cheeks...
Smart guy.
- Don't you understand jokes? - You
- are all buggers. The Chapayev men...
You're heroes only with women.
Cut it out about heroes.
Wait till I sneak to the Whites and bring back a prisoner who'll talk.
I bet I will...
We have to see about a prisoner yet.
Whether you bring him or not.
You think I'm going to leave?
Forget it.
Teach me the machine-gun, you devil.
This is called "cheeks".
Cheeks! I swear it's cheeks.
On the German front, I had the honor of fighting General von Ludendorf, and here, who the hell it is?
Chapayev! They say he was a sergeant.
There's nothing to laugh at,
Lieutenant.
Chapayev is a serious adversary.
He and his fame are equally dangerous.
Petrovich!
- Bring in The mail, please.
- Yes, Sergey Nikolayevich.
Don't you think, Colonel, that your relations with your orderly are too...
You mean, patriarchal?
Not at all. They're quite up-to-date.
Times change - relations change.
Too bad you don't understand it.
When you attack, you look back for fear of getting a bullet from behind.
- We all should look back.
- I never do.
Petrovich's been with me since 1914, he's gone through all fronts with me.
- He's mad at us.
- He promises to shoot us.
- Who promises? Why?
- Chapayev. Both of us.
What for?
A fellow-villager has come to Chapayev, he was a horse-doctor there.
- So Chapayev asked us...
- He demanded!
Yes, he demanded that we put this horse-quack to a test for a doctor.
I say: No veterinarian can test a horse-quack for a doctor.
- Chapayev got mad, called us names.
- Called us sobs.
- We know you, he says, you...
...son-of-a-bitches...
You would never let any muzhik become a doctor.
- Test him, he says, right now!
- And give him a document.
And make that document according to form, or there're 7 bullets in my gun and I'm ready to spoil two of them on you!
Aha, you're here, my dears!
Complaining! You scoundrels!
Enema injectors! Forward march!
So you're with them?
Routing for the rotten intelligentsia?
- They can't do it...
- And I say they can! They must!
Why won't you let a single muzhik be promoted to a doctor?
Test him at once and give him a document according to form!
You see, they can't do it.
They don't have a right to.
Especially to give him a document.
How you dare mocking at Chapayev?!
I'll kill you, bastard!
Alexander the Great was a great military commander, too.
But why break stools?
Alexander the Great?
Military commander?
Who is he? Why don't I know him?
I know all military commanders:
Garibaldi, Napoleon, Suvorov, but this one... Alexander... the Great?
Who is he? Why don't I know him?
Not many people know him.
He lived two thousand years ago.
But you know him, so I must know him too.
It's only two years since I've learned to read.
Come on, Commissar, tell me about this Alexander the Great.
Tell you? Very well.
I'm a sailor, very trim and handsome,
I'm only twenty years old.
Listen, sailor very trim and handsome.
I've been meaning to tell you.
You should make yourself more trim.
You always look so slovenly.
You're a regular Red Army commander, you must set an example for your men.
You mean your Alexander the Great did his fighting in white gloves?
- He didn't look like a tramp. - How d'ye know what was 2,000 years ago?
Lenin rightly said that a strong home front determines the final victory.
And in our General Headquarters, instead of strengthening this front, they're still diligently counting their chickens before they hatch.
To revive Russia...
Report. Cossack Dmitry Potapov was arrested when trying to desert.
Yes, that's my signature. I can't do anything about it. Discipline.
Besides, we have a HQ directive about deserters. An order is an order.
- Wait a minute. This Potapov is your kin? - My brother.
Why didn't you say it...
To subject to execution.
Chapayev's division was pushing forward...
There's unrest in the village.
The 3rd Platoon men are marauding.
Go find platoon commander Zhikharev and bring him here.
You monsters! We've been waiting for you, and you're taking our last?
- That's the Soviet power for you.
- Hush, grandma.
At wartime, even a piglet is a godsend.
You long-legged tyrant, damn you!
What's going on, damn it!
Some merry-go-round. The Whites rob us, the Reds rob us.
What is a peasant to do?
They come here, and we shout:
"Hurray! Hurray!" Damn them!
Are they your boys plundering in the village? Did you let them to?
Me? I don't know nothing about it.
Do you realize what it means?
All right, we'll talk tomorrow.
And now you're under arrest.
Who's under arrest? Me?
A war commander?
This is not something to toy with.
Stupid.
Arrest him.
Wait. First issue an order, so that everything be returned.
- Where's Zhikharev?
- He's here, under arrest.
- You know Zhikharev's my comrade-in- arms? - I know. - And you arrest him?
How dare you? You red-tape worm!
- And do you know that he allowed...
- Never mind what he allowed!
What he allowed, only I can forbid!
You get it?
No, Comrade Division Commander!
Who's heading the division?
You or I?
You... and I.
I'm Chapayev! Do you understand that I'm Chapayev?
And you? Who are you?
Who sent you here?
Want to have a free ride on my fame?
Get the hell out of my division!
I don't need your fame.
As for recalling me from the division, only the Party that sent me can do it.
You're a Communist too, so you must know that.
Comrades, citizens, Red Army men, who is Chapay among you?
- I am.
- Aren't you lying?
No, I am not. I'm him.
Then I'm here to see you.
Thank you very much. Your boys have returned everything, to the last thing.
Otherwise it was some merry-go-round:
The Whites came and robbed us.
The Reds came and started robbing too.
What is a peasant to do?
So thank you again, from all our community.
Commissar, call up a meeting,
I'll be speaking.
Vassily Ivanovich, the Commissar seems to be a...
- And I thought he's a...
- You thought...
They wouldn't send some nobody to Chapayev.
What's going on, comrades?
Such a disgrace for our division!
The entire Red Army's been smeared!
Who are you robbing? You're robbing your brother, the peasant!
We're sacrificing our lives for that peasant and for the worker.
'Gainst 'xploitation,
'gainst all sort of capital!
Is that what the Chapayev men famous for? Are we some bandits?
So watch out, heroes! I'll shoot everyone who'll be caught plundering.
With this hand of mine,
I'll shoot the bastard!
And if I'm caught, go ahead and shoot me!
I'm your commander only in action.
When at ease, I'm your comrade.
Come to see me at midnight and later.
If I'm drinking tea, join me.
If I'm having dinner, help yourself.
That's a commander I am. Am I right?
Right!
I weren't taught in academies.
I ain't finished any.
Vassily Ivanovich, men are wondering.
Are you a Bolshevik or a Communist?
What?
Tell me, are you for the Bolsheviks or for the Communists?
I'm for the International.
- Which one, Second or Third?
- What second? - The International.
- I'm for the right one.
- So Which one?
- Lenin was in which one? - The Third.
He founded it, the Third Bolshevistic.
Then I'm for the Third International, too.
That's it.
And even ahead of time.
Good for you, Anka. You excelled in technology.
So much for the studies, Anka.
Now you're buddies with the Maxim gun.
Remember what you said about being heroes with women?
I'm going to pay a visit to the Whites.
Chapay and the commissar sent me on an important mission to get a prisoner.
- Can you?
- I can do anything.
Don't even try it! I've taken out the charges. Drop the gun and no tricks!
Have you got many perches? Craving for fish soup? Some bungler.
- It's for Mit'ka... - For whom?
- For Mit'ka...
My brother. He's dying... he wants fish soup.
- Is he wounded or what?
- No. Lashed with ramrods.
With ramrods? And you serve them after that?
Mit'ka's dying... He wants fish soup...
Please let me go.
- And you let him go?
- I did, Vassily Ivanovich.
- But I've got his gun.
You scatter-brain! Under tribunal, you loafer!
Yes, under tribunal.
And you should make yourself more trim. You always look so slovenly.
What is it? You're a soldier of the regular Red Army, my orderly.
You're supposed to set an example, and you walk about like a tramp.
Well, as I said, under tribunal!
Mit'ka's died. My brother is dead.
Vassily Ivanovich was a peasant too.
Then worked as a carpenter in Balakov.
And now he's a military commander, and what a brilliant commander!
Frunze wanted to give him an army.
You and I, says he...
- Vassily Ivanovich turned him down.
- Who is it?
- Why? Let him answer first.
- Never mind. I missed anyway.
It's good that you're not sleeping.
But you shouldn't fire aimlessly.
But as long as you fire, be a good shot.
- Everything is quiet?
- Quiet, Comrade Commissar.
Hands up!
- A scout? - No. I've come to you.
Your boy caught me and let me go.
Now I've come on my own will.
So you're Pet'ka's White. Your gun.
- So The offensive is planned for tomorrow? - Yes, sir.
- You say, The officer units?
Kappelev's? - Yes, sir.
They devised some attack at the headquarters, a psychic one...
Pet'ka, take him to the quartermaster.
Keep him in the kitchen for awhile.
Come on, big guy, they almost sent me under tribunal on your account.
What does the commissar think?
They want to stop us by the counter-offensive, so they're forming a striking force.
And what does the commander think?
Don't worry, we'll meet them.
I'm going to the political department, to have a talk with the communists.
A psychic one?
Well, what the heck, let it be the psychic one.
Hey, black raven, hey, black raven,
Why you circling over me?
I shall never be your booty...
- So we're taking a battle?
- We are. Why aren't you sleeping?
So that you wouldn't say that everyone was sleeping and you fought alone.
- Did you sleep, Vassily Ivanovich?
- I did. Go to sleep, I said!
- Was it the night before? - Are you some inspector? A Sleep Commissar?
I shall never be your booty,
I'm not the prey of yours.
Yeah, we don't have enough ammunition.
Nor enough men.
You know, you're too awesome a man for my understanding.
I'd say you're like Napoleon!
Even more, Pet'ka, even more.
Napoleon had it easier.
There were no machine-guns or air planes then. It was no big deal.
The other day they've sent me an air plane, too.
It eats so much fuel, you'd never get enough.
- Vassily Ivanovich, can you command an army? - I can.
- How about a front?
- I can, Pet'ka, I can.
- And the Republic's armed forces?
- If they teach me a bit, I can.
Can you cope it on a world scale?
No, I can't. I don't know foreign languages.
Will you go to sleep, you pain in the neck?
- They attack in 30 minutes. Everyone at their places? - Captain's not here.
I'll shoot that bastard, Zhukov.
- Pet'ka, rush to the squadron!
- Yes!
Have we got enough cartridges?
If the battle is fierce, we'll be out of them in half a hour.
Come on, cook, take it!
- Mutiny in the squadron! They killed the commander. - What? Zhukov killed?
- Take along some men.
- No! I'll manage alone.
Quiet! Don't listen to the enemy. What are we going to win by taking our own?
There're lots of masters around.
We must kill all the masters!
You can go, but don't make us go.
Enough, we've had our share of fighting. Let others fight now.
Why should we leave our homes?
Right! We won't go. No! We've had enough. Let's go home, men!
Line up! Attention!
The country's best sons are giving their lives for the cause of Revolution.
And you...
Only spilling your blood will atone for your guilt!
I will myself go at the head!
Who fired?
Who fired?
We've finished one here ourselves.
Mount horses!
- Tell me, What do men Go to their death for? - What for?
It's simple: For their life.
Everybody wants a good life.
- That's Kappelev's officer regiment.
- Where's Chapay?
Hold on, Anka. I'm dying.
The cartridges...
- They're marching beautifully.
- Aristocrats.
Shoot, bastard, shoot!
They've sold us out, men.
We're done for.
Come back!
Stop! Cowards, abandoning your comrades!
Forward!
- Why did you stop? Why the delay?
- Go to hell...
Cossacks!
At the Kappelev Regiment HQ...
God's with us! Reds cowardly flee!
The Chapay men crushed like fleas!
Swell drawing! Son-of-a-bitches!
But the verse is no good.
No, Pet'ka, put it somewhere and keep it.
- Did you call me, Vassily Ivanovich?
- Yes, I did.
What's the matter, Madame? You should have fired. Did your gun getjammed?
- No, it didn't.
- Why didn't you fire then?
- I was waiting. - Waiting for what?
- Waiting when they get closer.
Look at her... What a girl!
You fire very well. Good for you!
Pet'ka, give it here.
That's for you, as a keepsake.
Sit down and have some tea.
Autumn
Father wouldn't believe his son
That there's such thing as love.
A funny story.
The son took a saber, very sharp,
And he stabbed himself dead.
A funny story.
Yes, a very funny story.
Due to an emergency, I insist on
Furmanov's immediate departure.
He is to be succeeded by Sedov.
Frunze.
That's it, Vassily Ivanovich.
- They hurt me by this.
- They have other fronts to think of.
If it wasn't Frunze, I'd never...
This is your new commissar.
You know him very well.
The disposition of the Red forces is:
HQ and Political Dept. In Lbishchensk, the division's main forces under
Yelan's command are in Sakharnaya.
As you see, the HQ remains isolated, and can be reached by the steppe.
This is our only chance to do away with Chapayev.
Yes, this is our last chance to annihilate Chapayev and hold Lbishchensk.
There's no other way.
We need a brave, determined officer to head this operation.
- To whom do you plan to entrust it?
- I would be happy if...
- You entrusted me with this operation.
- I could hope for nothing better.
I put the fate of our front in your hands.
By the way, the Allied Command valued Chapayev's head at 20,000.
The Allied Command could afford to give even more.
Behind him is the city of Guriev, and Guriev has oil.
The storm was rolling, raining hard,
The thunder roared, holding grip,
A lightning sparkled like a dart,
The tempest rolling in the deep.
The night is pitch-black, we should double the guards.
The Cossack tribe beat it as far as
Guriev.
- They won't dare to come near me.
- Look, Vassily Ivanovich.
All right, tell them to put up additionalposts.
- How lucky you are! - What?
- I say you and Pet'ka are so lucky!
- You're young, with your whole life to live. - You're not old yourself.
Old or not, but I'm not like your
Pet'ka.
You'll get married, you'll work together.
The war will be over, you'll have a beautiful life.
Do you know what life will be like?
You'll never wish to die.
No one wants to die.
But our struggle is such that we can't spare our lives.
Either we win, or they win.
No, we win.
Why did you stop singing? Come on...
Well, will I make a good performer?
Everything is quiet. The road is clear.
Stop! Where are you going? Down!
Let's run to the guns!
Sakharnaya! Sakharnaya!
- They cut it, bastards! - Ride to
Sakharnaya, to Yelan! Both of you!
Go on, I say!
I can't leave him! And you go!
Goodbye!
- It's you?
- Me.
- That's it! We have to retreat.
- Chapayev never retreats.
Chapayev is wounded. Take him over the river!
Go ahead, swim. I can manage myself.
No, you won't get me!
Forward!
Fire!
The End
Tom Lincoln!
It's a comin'
- Boy or gal?
- 'T aint fur enough along yit fer a tag.
- How's Nancy standin' it?
- She's a-prayin'
It's a boy?
It's as long as an eel!
Shucks, he'never amount to nothin' nohow!
Is he purty?
Homely as a mud fence!
What do you 'low to call him, Aunty?
Abraham.
There he is. Ugliest, laziest, smartest man in New Salem.
- Ain't yuh, Abe?
- I don't mind my face, I'm behind it.
It's the people in front that get jarred.
Whip any man in shoo leather I At least, I hope he can.
Offut does the braggin'
I do the runnin'
You better dust off them shoes then, stranger,
'cause you ain't here for long.
Well, I was aimin' to settle here awhile.
- This ain't no peaceable town.
- Well, I'm a peaceable man.
Wait till
Jack Armstrong gets hold o' yuh.
He'll throw yuh out that door like yuh was a sack o' meal!
- Big fellow?
- No bigger'n you, but he's champeen o' this country he ain' never been licked.
And when he sees you...
Folks can't even spit without his sayso.
Chuck me outa that door, you say?
Like a sack o' meal.
Well, that's a pretty long chuck for a peaceful man.
Whar be he?
Now, Armstrong, cain't you leave us be?
Yuh just busted up old man Simpson's place and scattered his new place all over the county.
Man, don't you ever rest?
Whare be he?
That yellow-livered baboon from Indianny!
I come from Indianny, but not that part.
Well, get down!
Let's see what bones
I wants to crack first!
Get a good hold, Jack!
Come on, an' get yer neck broke!
This is the neatest wrestle you've ever had.
Go to him, Champ!
- Get 'in, Jack!
- Abraham Lincoln!
- Let's get 'im, Abe come on!
- Get 'in, Jack!
- Get 'im, Jack!
- Atta boy, Abe!
I'll bet yuh ten dollars,
Offut, on the Champeen!
- Watch 'im, boy!
- Git 'im!
- Watch 'im, boy!
- Come on, git 'im!
- Come on, git 'im!
- Git 'im!
Watch 'im, boy!
Come on, git 'im!
Now, come on, all o' you.
I'm the big tuck of thisn lick!
Yuh are, eh?
Hold on, boys!
He throwed me fair.
What's your name?
Lincoln,...
Abraham Lincoln.
Well, we're goin' to make yuh one of us.
Come on, boys, I'll set 'em up!
It's about time you set 'em up.
Let's have some o' that rattlesnake bite.
He said he was a peaceful man.
He meant peaceful like a wildcat!
Yeh, that's what he thought.
Looks like good corn liquor.
That is corn liquor.
Come on, Abe. Where's yours?
No, I don't care much for it.
Come on, have a drink, Abe.
Well, I'll drink if you'll take it like I do.
How's that?
Lift up the barrel, and drink it outa the bung.
Well, I'll show you boys.
Maybe can, maybe can't.
Try it, anyway.
Whew!
He's the strongest man in Salem!
I told you he was the strongest man.
I've seen him lift
500 pounds in each hand.
- Ain't yuh drinkin?
- No.
- Teetotal?
- No.
Reformer?
No, I don't regulate nobody's drinkin' just my own.
I've seen him lift a thousand...
- In this sense,-
- the term "law" -
- includes any edict,-
- decree, order,-
- ordinance,-
- statute, resolutión,- rule, etcetera. -
¡Uff!, etcetera...
Well, my old Daddy taught me how to work, but he never taught me how to like it.
I reckon I better keep on with the lesson.
I'd rather keep on with something else.
You made a bad bargain making me the professor.
Well he told me about that too.
He said:
"When you make a bad bargain, hug it all the tighter".
But he didn't mean this kind of a bargain.
Well, don't you like it,
Ann, when I hold you tight?
I guess every girl sorta likes that...
Now, Abe, what is law?
Well, professor, law is a rule of human conduct governing
Whoa!
Abe, I'ain't payin' you no forty cents a day to spark a pretty gal!
Well, Uncle Jimmie,
I don't charge nothing extra for it just throw it in.
I'm expectin' a sight of rails cut of you.
He's the best rail-splitter in the country.
He'll be more than a rail-splitter.
How old are you, Uncle Jimmie?
Oh nearin' forty.
I'll get you out forty more rails than you expected.
Giddap! Maybe you'd better make it nearin' seventy!
Now, Abe, your professor needs a seat where's there's more law and less temptatión.
Oh, Abe! Ohhh!
Ohhhh!
- Are you all right, Anne?
- I think so.
- Are you hurt?
- My legs are still on me.
Scared me worse than it did you.
Did it, Abe?
You know, Anne, if anything happened to you, I don't think I could live.
Funny, Abe, I feel the same about you.
You taught me how to love.
Have I taught you to like it?
In the gloaming, oh, my darling,-
When the lights are dim and low,-
And the quiet shadows falling. -
Softly come and softly go. -
It's awful nice this time of day.
Yes, Abe.
Can I tell you a sort of a story, Anne?
Why of course, Abe.
Well, there was a town in lllinois called... called...
- New Salem?
- Yeh, that's it.
And in that town lived the prettiest girl in the worid.
What was her name?
Anne Rutledge.
Oh, Abe...
What I'd like to find out about that girl is, she ever take a little time off to think about gettin' married?
Well, maybe.
'Cause there's an Abe Lincoln hanging around that's a pretty good catch.
What's he like?
Oh, he's a big merchant, owner of three stores all bankrupt.
Well, is he handsome?
His pa said that Abe had been cut out with an axe.
Politician too, I hear.
Yes, he's got less property and owes more debts than anybody ever running for the legislature.
Oh, Abe, you'll do all right when you get started.
There's something I'd like to start right now if I thought I could finish it.
You know, Anne, I...
I've always done a lot of dreamin' and lately it seems when I dream, your face gets mixed up in it.
Does it really, Abe?
Tell me about the mixin'
I feel as though I'm going to be seeing your face till the day I die.
'Course I know that would be pretty hard for you to have to look at my face that long.
Everybody to their own opinión
Meaning?
I think... it's the dearest, kindest, most beautiful face in the whole worid!
Oh, Anne...
Anne...
I know that's just flattery but I love it.
You know
I feel like little Jimmie Watkins, he got a hunk of gingerbread the other day and says:
"I guess there's nobody likes ginger bread like I does and gets so little of it".
Oh, Abe!
Anne, will you... will you marry me?
I mean, of course when I... when I... get out of debt and can support you?
Well, you know, Abe,
I've intended to for a long while that is, of course, if you asked me.
You... you mean?
Yes, Abe, you've got your gingerbread.
Oh, Anne!
Will you think of me and love me-
As you did once long ago?-
How is she, Doctor?
Pretty bad.
She's been asking for you, Abe.
I came as soon as I could.
I had the fever pretty bad myself.
I've got to tell you the truth, Abe,
It's hopeless... perhaps by tomorrow... no longer.
I'm so glad you came, Abe.
Are you all right now?
Now, don't bother about me, dear.
I'm all right now.
I know the truth, dear.
It's good-bye.
No, no, Anne dear, you're not going to leave me!
I won't let you!
We must be brave, dear...
Don't take me away!
Don't take me away!
It's so dark and lonesome going!
Anne, you mustn't let go!
If they'd sing,
I wouldn't be so afraid.
In the sweet by and by,-
We shall meet on that beautiful shore. -
We will meet there, dear.
Oh... I love you so!
I love you so!
Feeling any better, Bowling?
No, not much.
I'll tell you, Doctor, he's just like a sick child...
He was lost for five days before we found him.
Yeh, I know.
We took his pocket-knife away from him, we were so afeard something might happen.
Good gracious,
Abe, you're looking better!
No use trying to talk to him, he just cain't answer.
If we could only think of something that would just bring him back.
I guess time's the only thing.
Why should the spirit of mortal be proud, like a swift-fleeting meteor, fast-flying cloud?
Flash of the lightning, break of the wave,
He passes from life to his rest in the grave.
My goodness, Mary Todd, just think!
He'll be here in a few minutes the catch of America!
Stephen A. Douglas!
Just think of being his wife!
Don't be in such a hurry, sister.
I'm not even engaged much less married.
But if he should propose?
How do I know he's going further than anyone else in Springfield?
When I pick a husband, sister,
I'll pick a man!
But I don't know what you're talking about.
A lot of people seem to think a man named Abraham Lincoln is going even further than Mr. Douglas.
Why, Mary Todd, have you gone crazy?
You compare an unknown cornfield lawyer with a brilliant cultured gentleman like Stephen A. Douglas!
Why, if you just saw the two of them together.
Oh, he's here!
Mr. Douglas is down in the parlor and he's asking for Mary!
Now, Mary, you must be very careful, and remember he doesn't like to have giris too bold.
Don't get so excited, sister, and don't hurry me.
I'll take care of myself.
You glide through the dance like grace itself Miss Todd.
Always the politician, Mr. Douglas!
Who wouldn't be a politician with so fair a constituent to win?
- Exquisite!
- The fan, Mr. Douglas?
No, the fair owner herself.
- May I look?
- Sr. Douglas...
I wonder if you'd do me a great favor?
Yes.
Then, pray present me to this young lady.
- Miss Todd?
- Yes?
May I present one of the leading lawyers of Springfield
Mr. Abraham Lincoln?
Mr. Lincoln!
Miss Todd I wonder if you'd honor me with the next dance?
Why,... why...
I'd be delighted.
Miss Todd, you thought my face was funny, and the way I dressed even funnier, but the joke's on you.
Why, I don't understand.
Wait till you dance with me.
Have you got the license, Mr. Lincoln?
Well, she got you.
I knew she would when she started out the first time for you.
Now, Billie, don't bother me.
I'm going to be married and I'm scared to death.
Oh, don't be alarmed.
There's many a bite that's worse than a bride's.
But, Billie, that woman scares me.
She's even got the ridiculous idea that I could get to be president.
Oh, don't take that seriously.
Every spunky girl thinks that her husband ought to be president.
I know, Billie, but it's a pity to fool her.
And she's a fine woman, smart as pepper and pretty too.
She'll be a great help to you, Mr. Lincoln, but you've got to keep climbing with her.
Yes... yes, I know.
I've got the best supper you've ever tasted and the cake... wait till you see that cake!
What can have happened to Mr. Lincoln? It's long after the...
He would be late at his own wedding.
Now, never mind, Mary, if he doesn't come soon,
I'll send John after him.
But he's hours late already!
Think of that!
Sister, calm yourself.
For heaven's sakes, you've got to hurry!
Billie, you... you go ahead.
You go on over and I'll come later.
I doubt if there's a word in the dictionary that could tell how I feel!
Billie, what does a man do if his head's all right but his legs are cowardly?
My cure is to get drunk.
My legs are too frightened to pay any attentión to liquor.
I'll go ahead and tell them that you're coming.
Anne!
Anne!
Anne!
We looked, everywhere, tort we can't find him.
No, can't find him... not at the office.
What on earth happened to him?
He was in a terrible state when I left him.
He was so frightened and upset.
I imagine he just ran away.
Ran away... from me!
On our weddin' day!
Now sistern dear...
Don't 'sister' me!
Can you imagine! That's what a Todd gets for engagin' herself to a country baboon!
- Listen, dear, you mustn't...
- You may as well all go home!
You hear me?
You may as well all go home!
Not goin' to be any weddin' here.
You can all go home as far as I'm concerned!
But this is so distressing!
You certainly are a matchmaker to reconcile those two after what happened two years ago.
We all like Mr. Lincoln, and Mary is just the girl to push him along.
Oh, Mary, how sweet you look!
What a lovely dress!
Yes, and so becoming to her too.
Maybe that's Mr. Lincoln now.
Julia it all seems so strange having things end this way.
It's just as it should end. You and
Mr. Lincoln will make a great man.
Good morning, Mr. Lincoln.
Good morning.
Come, my dear we'll leave the happy pair alone.
Good morning, Mary.
I,... I...
Mary, you don't have to bother about me any more.
I think I've settled down at last.
I hope I can make your future all you desire.
We'll say no more about it, Mr. Lincoln.
I really think, after all, you need me.
You'll need a lot of patience to put up with me, Mary, but if anyone can do it,
I'm sure you're the one.
Oh, Mary!
Douglas is a prize speaker, but just wait till old Abe gets ahold of him on slavery!
You're crazy!
Lincoln has no more chance of beating
Douglas for Senate than I have.
He only went to school for three months.
There must be no issue of slavery.
We must face the facts.
I'll run Mr. Lincoln out of this campaign.
I will not throw mud.
Let each State mind its own business and this Republic can exist forever... divided into free and slave states.
We will not allow the extensión of slavery to any State.
We will not allow the secessión of any State.
Above all and before all, the Unión must be preserved.
A house divided against itself must fall!
- Douglas elected!-
- Hurrah for Douglas!-
- Douglas elected!-
- Hurrah for Douglas!-
- Douglas elected!-
- Hurrah for Douglas!-
Mary...
I'm home, Mary.
You must be tired, Mr, Lincoln.
Sit down.
You just ait right here.
I'll get your supper for you in a minute.
Billy, I feel like the little boy who stubbed his toe.
It hurt too bad to laugh, and he was too big to cry.
I'm fifty years old, Billy, and a failure in everything.
If I died today, nobody'd ever know I'd lived.
Come in.
Mr. Lincoln,
I want you to meet Mr. Pell one of the most important men in Eastern politics.
- I'm pleased to meet you, Mr. Pell.
- I'm honored, indeed, Mr. Lincoln.
- Meet my partner, Mr, Herndon.
- How do you do, Mr. Herndon?
Happy to meet you, sir.
- Won't you sit down, gentlemen?
- Thank you.
Mr. Lincoln, your campaign against
Douglas has made you a national figure.
I'm here to ask you if you will consider being the Republican party's candidate for the presidency.
Did you say a failure in everything?
- A telegram for you, Mr. Fell.
- Oh thank you.
Mr. Lincoln, you know ever since John Brown's raid, the South has been infuriated, the East on the verge of revolt, and now New York threatens to quit the Unión.
No, no New York mustn't do that.
We must keep the front door on the hinge.
There can be no secessión.
The Unión must be preserved.
The crisis is at hand, Mr. Lincoln, and we believe you are the man.
Gentlemen,
I feel deeply grateful.
Paw, Maw says if you don't come on home, you won't get no supper.
"I have another crisis; the soup and the country are boiling over together!"
Maw's boiling too!
It needs deep consideratión.
Well, Mr. Lincoln, mayn't we meet you at our hotel later?
- I'll be there within the hour?
- Thank you.
Come on, Paw, we're hungry.
They've started it.
This is gonna mean war!
This darkio saw it himself.
Brown and a gang of Abolxitionists have captured the armory at Harper's Ferry!
They're arming the slaves to rise up and murder us all.
They gived us all rifles.
And what'd you do with yours?
What'd I do? I trowed it down, and I say, 'Feet, you travel'
- They can't invade Virginia.
- No!
Boys, go home and git your guns.
What's all this talk about guns?
This thing has gone far enough.
We'll be murdered in our beds by our own slaves.
Pardon me, ladies, while I find out about this desecratión.
- John Brown, eh?
- Abolitionists!
It's an outrage!
Outrage isn't the word.
I'll shoot on sight every Abolitionist who dares defile the soil of old Virginia.
- Who's he?
- That's the actor, John Wilkes Booth.
He can't act but the women don't know it.
All right, men, get your guns and we'll meet at the square!
At the square!
Can't say much for her dispositión!
Hush! She may hear you.
Soldiers, indeed!
They can't even carry trunks.
Here you no, the stupid-looking one put that over there... and you... idiot don't look at me like a duck in a thunderstorm!
Hurry... hurry!
Will you put them in there?
I never saw such a lot of incompetents.
And as for you with the whiskers,
I told you to put it in there.
Oh, is it going to take forever?
Thank heavens, that's the last!
Imbeciles!
Well, Mary, we're here.
Thanks to me! If it wasn't for my advice, you'd be out in Oregon, chopping trees.
Yes, you're always right, Mary.
I've found out one thing, Lincoln.
Servants here are no better than they are in Springfield.
This place hasn't been cleaned in a year.
Why, Mr. President!
Huh?
Then we agree that the situatión of our country is ominous.
- Most alarming.
- Certainly.
We agree that we must yield to the demands of the South and evacuate Fort Sumter.
- Absolutely.
- It's the only solutión.
That must be done.
We agree that our President must be firmly guided by us.
That we must make every effort to control his inexperienced judgment.
- We certainly must.
- Yes.
Gentlemen...
- Mr. President.
- Good morning, Mr. President.
Thank you, Hay.
Thank you, gentlemen...
I will shoulder all responsibilities.
The relief shall go to Fort Sumter.
That means war.
Mr. Seward, I am a man of peace, but the Unión shall be preserved.
Seventy-five thousand...
It might be difficult to get that many volunteers.
- Glory, glory Hallelujah,-
- Glory, glory Hallelujah!-
- Glory, glory Hallelujah!-
- His soul is marching on!-
- Glory, glory Hallelujah,-
- Glory, glory Hallelujah!-
Glory, glory Hallelujah!-
- I wish I was in Dixie,-
- Hooray! Hooray!-
- In Dixieland I'll take my stand-
- To live and die in Dixie. -
- Away, away, away down South in Dixie,-
- Away, away, away down South in Dixie. -
- I wish I was in Dixie,-
- Hooray! Hooray!-
- In Dixieland I'll take my stand-
- To live and die in Dixie. -
- Away, away, away down South in Dixie,-
- Away, away, away down South in Dixie. -
President, the people demand a victory, and we've got to take Richmond.
The country is discouraged.
We must do something.
That reminds me of a story... about a man building a boat to cross a river.
He got impatient building the boat and started swimming.
Well, sir, what happened?
He drowned.
We've got to be careful not to drown this country.
Ready here!
Ready here!
- Quartermaster General.
- Yes, sir.
Ready here!
Ready here!
- Ready here!
- Sergeant, I'm going out.
- How did you make out?
- Make out?
He darned near kissed me.
- Who?
- The Secretary of War.
We're just licking the tar out of thorn all along the line.
- Who's next?
- I am.
I hope it's for the President.
I'd like to sec his face when he gets the good news.
Ready here! Commissary.
For General Scott.
Marked private.
Rush it it's victory!
General Scott, what news?
We're winning, sir. I'm sure of it.
- I wish...
- Come in.
Rebel resistance broken at Bulll Run,- our army sweeping everything before it. -
President, if we can capture Richmond now, it means the end of the war.
- Ah, thank God.
- And you, sir... this victory will silence your enemies forever and you will be the greatest president in our history.
It doesn't matter what they think of me, General.
- We will have saved the Unión.
- Yes.
General, would you mind letting me have that telegram?
I'd like to show it to Mrs. Lincoln myself.
Why, certainly, not, Mr. President.
And would you mind not calling me 'Mr. President'.. just Lincoln.
All right, Lincoln.
Ready here!
Headquarters!
Sergeant, all messages for General Scott, hold.
All messages for General Scott hold.
All messages for General Scott hold.
Attentión! Commanding officer.
At ease!
Ready here!
Bad news?
Give it to me.
Attentión the President!
At ease!
Well, General, what news now?
And the first reports?
Over-confidence.
Yes, I should have known.
Impossible to reform lines. -
The men are a confused mob,- entirely demoralized. -
You must make every effort to save Washington.
Battalion!
On right into line, March!
Company, halt!
Left turn!
Right turn!
Halt!
First Company, right by fours.
Halt!
Forward!
Halt!
Forward!
Well, they're gathering.
The reserves are gathering, sir.
- How many regulars can we muster?
- About five thousand.
- Volunteers?
- Doubtful, sir.
Can we hold Washington?
We'll do our best sir.
Mr. Hay, is it true we have to get out of Washington?
It is very serious, madam.
For heaven's sake, what sort of an army have we anyhow?
They did the best they could, Mrs. Lincoln.
They might have considered us.
It'll take forever to get those trunks packed.
I'm sorry, madam, for all of us.
Mr. Lincoln, I hear we're leaving.
Just a moment, Mary, please.
After all the trouble we had getting here,
I must say we've had a very short stay.
Mary, I've hung up my hat right here, and here it stays till they knock it off with a bayonet.
From now on, Mary,
I'm going to run this war.
March! Halt!
Headquarters,
Post Number Four.
Halt! Guard.
Forward March!
Counsel of the accused, have you nothing further to say in defense of the prisoner?
The court finds you guilty and the sentence death.
- Just a minute.
- The President... attentión!
You must pardon me, gentlemen, for this intrusión.
I overheard one of our soldiers sentenced to death.
Yes, Mr. President.
A bad example of cowardice and desertión.
Well, young man, tell me about it.
I think the findings of the court were just, sir.
That all you have to say?
Sire, it was our first big battle.
We were trying to take a stone wall.
We'd been trying, it seems, for years...
Go on.
Finally, though, we got there.
I was fighting bayonets.
We were all crazy... on top of the wall...
Yes?
There was my boyhood chum, looking up at me from the ground.
Not alive, we had killed him a long time ago, but I knew him.
And then?
I guess I went really crazy, sir.
That's all.
The captain reports that you threw your rifle away.
Yes, sir. That must be right, sir.
Making excuses, Colton?
No, sir only... get it over with, quick!
Hanging, killing, blood.
I'm tired.
But my generals are right, we must maintain discipline.
That's all.
Wait a minute.
Bring that young man back.
I have it!
- It's a leg case.
- I beg your pardon, sir?
Leg case... yes, yes, my shelves are full of them, but not quite like this one.
If the Lord Almighty gives a man a cowardly pair of legs, and that man gets frightened, he can't help his legs running away with him, can he?
Young man, I'm going to pardon you.
Go back and do your duty.
Oh, I will, sir! I will!
I'm trusting you.
Well, Senator?
Mr. President, my state of New York is crying out against this endless slaughter.
And mine, sir.
They're holding services here today for those who were sacrificed, as they are everywhere.
From the East to the West, sir.
It can't go on, sir.
New England,the West, the entire country are in mourning for this useless waste of lives.
Let the Southern States go there wat, Mr. President, and we will go ours.
But I tell you, Mr. President...
- ... out of the wilderness,-
- out of the wilderness. -
- Old Abe Lincoln-
- came out of the wilderness,- down in lllinois. -
Daddy, mother won't let me stay up.
She wants me to go to bed, and I don't want to.
Don't you think it's time for little boys to be in bed, Tad?
- But I want to stay with you.
- But your mother?
If you say so, she can't make me.
You're the President.
You're the only person in the country who thinks I should have any authority.
- Run along now.
- No.
I want to stay with you.
Please, can't I, daddy?
No, we're very busy here now, Tad.
Run along.
All right, daddy.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Sleep tight.
Goodnight...
Gentlemen, don't you suppose my heart bleeds for all the sorrows this war has brought upon us?
Do you suppose there is a human being who wants peace more than I do.
But we want lasting peace, and we can have that only by preserving the Unión.
And, gentlemen... the Unión is going to be preserved!
- And by virtue of the power,-
- and for the purpose aforesaid,-
- I do order and declare-
- that all persons held as slaves -
- within said designated states-
- and parts of states-
- are henceforward-
- and forever shall be... - free. -
Well, gentlemen, it is done.
- More bad news, Hay?
- I'm afraid there is.
Well, let's have it.
The Secret Service reports that there are 600.000 pperheads in the North and under cath and arme
- To get me?
- Yes.
That many ought to keep me dodging.
We're taking every precautión to guard you.
Where are they mostly?
Ohio has one 100.000 armed men ready to rise up and depose you. lllionois, 135.000. lllinois, my old stamping ground...
That makes me feel badly.
You mustn't tell Mary.
But Mr. President, we are worried about you.
Don't mind me, Hay.
Go on to bed, you're tired.
Lincoln, come on to bed.
I'm worried, Mary.
You can't win this war worrying and walking around in your stocking feet.
I can't sleep.
Neither can I. At least we could sleep in Springfield, couldn't we?
Did we ever sleep?
Now, stand still.
I've got it, Mary.
I've found the man to win this war and his name is Grant.
I'm sorry, Mr. President, but smoking is one of my most persistent habits.
And winning victories is another.
Thank you.
Then you do believe in me, Sir?
I sent for you.
General, the North is desperate.
We need you.
And, should I assume command, there will be no interference?
None. I promise you that.
Grant,...
Lieutenant-General is the highest army command the President can bestow.
We haven't had one since General Washington.
He was a fair sort of a soldier too.
Lieutenant-General Grant,... my orders are: Win the War.
I'll give my best, Mr. President.
I know you will.
Unfortunately many of us have failed to recognize a great Confederate Soldier.
Lee.
On the other hand, we have thus far failed to take advantage of a great Northern Soldier.
I hope I am not too late in correcting the error.
Mr. President,
I think it only fair to warn you that many people, don't approve of me.
Nor of me.
But rest assured there will be no interference, no intrusión.
Well, of all things!
Who locked this door?
My wife!
All right, Mary.
Land sakes!
Where did all the smoke come from?
Mary, meet General Grant. Mrs. Lincoln.
- It's a pleasure to meet the first lady.
- Thank you.
- I want to talk to you. Mr. Lincoln.
- But Mary, we...
I want to talk to you about discharging some of the servants in this house.
I don't see how anybody could talk in here with all this smoke.
Why don't you open the window?
I can't stand it!
Pardon me, General.
I'll have to talk to you later.
- I'm very sorry if...
- There no apoligies, General.
You've given me an idea.
I may take up smoking myself.
But to resume, General.
We will give you all the help you need.
Every man capable of bearing arms shall go.
We've got to win this war.
It is a duty we owe the South as well as the North.
It's a big job, Mr. President... a big job. but thy will be done.
Thy will be done.
We're in a tight place now.
Yes, we generally are, Stanton.
Everything depends upon Sheridan.
He's a fighting Irishman.
Then why doesn't he fight?
- One división Sheridan's -
- army routed. -
Now trying to hold left flank. -
Oh, the blood it takes to hold this Unión together.
It will undo everything
Grant has done. It's hopeless.
I don't think so...
Before each victory I've had a visión of a ship with white sails.
That visión has just conic to me.
With all respect,
I'd rather trade your ship for good news from Sheridan.
Is that General Sheridan in there?
Sure 'tis General Sheridan.
Doesn't that sound like cannon fire?
I don't hear anything, sir.
Hey, come here.
Have you good ears?
Pretty good when they're washed.
Then try them.
Do you hear anything like cannon fire?
It's cannon all right, over by the swamp.
They may have caught
General Wright by surprise!
Mount those shorses!
- Sheridan's entire army-
- has met an overwhelming defeat. -
Incredible.
And no word from Sheridan.
I'm afraid he was away.
It means the defeat of all our plans.
Yes, for we'll have to withdraw Grant from Richmond to protect Washington.
Come on, boys! Come on!
General, the right wing is in full retreat.
Impossible to hold our positión, sir.
Tell Colonel Tolliver to reform and hold at all costs.
We're going back!
Officers, reform your men!
We're going back!
- Come on boys, let's go!
- Let's go, boys!
Forward!
Forward to victory!
- Down with, the traitor,-
- up with the star!-
- While we rally-
- 'round the flag boys,-
- We'll rally-
- once again,- shouting the battle cry of freedom!-
Yes, we'll rally 'round the flag, boys-
We'll rally once again,-
Shouting the battle cry of freedom,-
- We will rally from the hillside,-
- We'll gather from the plain. -
Shouting the battle cry of freedom,-
- The Unión forever,-
- hurrah, boys, hurrah!-
- Sown with the traitor,-
- up with the star. -
While we rally round the flag boys,-
We'll rally once again,-
Shouting the battle cry of freedom,-
Arrived in time to reform forces. -
Have struck the enemy-
- and have won an overwhelming victory. Sheridan. -
I knew it.
I knew it...
Better and better. Look! Here.
Tremendous number of prisoners.
Prisoners?
I hope there's nothing but prisoners from now on.
The ship, Stanton!
Yes, Mr. President, and Sheridan!
Surrender... my poor army!
I'd rather die a thousand deaths than do that to them.
There, General, you must lie down and rest.
Rest... that's a beautiful word...
They've caught a spy and they want the order for his executión approved.
Colonel Marshall... who was that?
- Only a courier, sir.
- What did he want?
They've caught a spy.
I approved the executión order, sir.
Colonel,... the only reason for shooting a spy is the protectión of an army, isn't it?
Yes, sir.
Well,... you and I know that this army can't exist much longer.
Isn't that right?
Yes, sir.
That is why I am unwilling that there shall be a single life lost unnecessarily.
Colonel...
I wonder if you'd mind countermanding that order.
I will.
Yes, sir.
Tired, Grant?
Not much.
Mr. President, we have them.
It can only last a few days more.
General Sherman and I are glad of this chance to talk with you.
The Unión... we've saved it at last.
They must surrender soon.
The Unión...
We'll have 'em all back...
United, free... one Country.
And meanwhile, Mr. President?
I've heard the country wishes all rebel property confiscated and the rebel generals, such as Lee, shot for treason.
He's put up a grand battle.
And they've robbed the cradle and the grave, sir.
Lee is fighting with his last breath.
Shoot Robert E. Lee?
Someone will have to shoot
Abraham Lincoln first.
They're rebels, not traitors.
And their horses and baggage, sir?
They'll need them for the spring plowing.
Let 'em keep 'em and get to work.
Very good, sir.
Just one thing more, Mr. President... the head of the rebel government
Jefferson Davis?
Jefferson Davis...
Do you wish his capture?
That reminds me of a story.
We had a terrible drunkard once in Springfield.
Finally he signed the pledge.
Next day he got thirsty and went to a bar and ordered a lemonade.
While the bartender was fixing it, the old drunk got sadder and sadder.
Finally he leaned over and said to the bartender,
"Mike, while you're fixin' that, couldn't you put a nice little shot of whiskey in, unbeknownst to meself?"
Well, sir?
Couldn't you sort of lot Jeff Davis escape, unbeknownst to yourselves?
We'll do our part, sir.
We're going to take them back as though they'd never been away.
Lincoln...
He freed the negroes.
He's supressed the right of a trail by jury.
He muzzled the press!
Now, wiht the oid of this "butternuts", his army and his negroes, he make himself
King of the América.
Lincoln!
I drink to him... and his domatión!
Right,... you're right.
On my part...
Go on, you're among friends...
The man who kills Abraham Lincoln will be inmortal.
Now, listen...
I have a plan... and I'm going in.
Do you mind my smoking, Mrs. Lincoln?
No, not much.
You don't know how glad we all are that you were reelected, Mr. President.
I'm sure this lady will be glad to spend four more years in the White House.
Glad? I've just hired two new maids.
Lincoln, will you ever learn to keep your feet in shoes?
Mrs. Lincoln, have you met General Grant?
I met him. It took us a week to get the smoke out of the curtains.
Yes, Oglesby, he's one human being who has faults.
A party of prohibitionists, called on me the other day and complained about Grant's drinking.
I told 'em if I knew what brand he uses,
I'd send barrels of it to my other generals.
Two new maids...
If we're going to be here four more years...
Four years... four more years...
Mr. Lincoln, don't you go thinking about of those dreams again.
You'll live two hundred and after we'll celebrate it right over here, we'll travel around the worid and have a nice long rest.
Oh, Daddy!,
Would that be fun?
- You're not going without me...?
- Why, of course not, Tad.
You can depend on Mother Surratt, and everything is straight with me.
I said I'd go through with it, and I will.
Tonight will be remembered throughout the ages.
I play my best part.
How much better a dagger would look,
Cassius used a dagger, but this is safer.
- Speech!
- Speech!
- Speech!
- Speech!
Again I say, with malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, we shall bind up the natión's wounds and cherish peace.
That government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.
Thank you.
God bless you all.
Mr. Lincoln, I'm just proud of you!
- Peanuts, hold the horse for me?
- Yes.
Will you be long, sir?
No, not very long.
Dundreary, would you mind bringing me a wrap?
I feel a draught.
I'm afraid you must be mistaken.
Mr. Lincoln... has just stopped the draft.
I reckon I'm going to feel right to home here, b'gosh!
I would be too if it wasn't for that 'ternal servant-critter with brass buttons on his coat.
He just swells out his big bosom like a turkey cock in layin' time, looks at me as if I meant to esquatulate with the spoons.
I reckon they don't know who they're dealin' with, but I'll show 'em.
I'm as obstinate as Deacon Stumpp's forelock.
"It wouldn't lie down; it couldn't stand up," wouldn't point forward and couldn't go backward.
I don't know what they're going to do with me, but whatever they do do and wherever they put me,
I hope it's outa the reach of that jackass.
I'm a real hoss, I am, and I get kinda riley with them critters.
They say I don't know the manners of good society too, but I guess I know enough to turn that old gal inside out, the sock-dollaging old mantrap.
But I dare no more kill her than I dare ask Queen Victoria to dance a Cape Cod reel.
Sic semper tyrannis!
Mr. Lincoln,
Mr. Lincoln has been shot!
Get a doctor!
Somebody get a doctor!
Glory, glory Hallelujah!-
Glory, glory Hallelujah!-
Glory, glory Hallelujah!-
His soul is marching on!-
[CAT MEOWING]
MAN:
Eight o'clock.
All's well. Misty weather.
[VIOLIN PLAYING]
- Here ye are, me lad.
- Thank ye.
A press gang. A press gang!
MAN 1: The press gang!
MAN 2: Let's get out of here!
In the king's name!
Well, we got all the fish we need in one net.
- Line them up, boatswain.
- Aye, aye. Line up, lads!
Lads, bow your necks and weep.
You're in the king's navy.
I'm no seaman, sir. I'm a tailor.
What's that, your needlework?
No chin music.
- What ship?
- The Bounty, for the South Seas.
- The South Seas?
- That's the end of the world.
No, he sailed there with Captain Cook.
He knows the brown gals gay as kiss-me.
- Who's the captain?
- Bligh.
- Bligh!
- Seize him!
How long will we be gone?
Till there's enough frost in hell to kill snap beans.
How long is that, sir?
I've got to know.
- Two years, lad.
- Please, don't take my husband.
When we had a baby,
Tommy left the sea.
He don't want to serve in the navy.
- It's true, sir.
- Sorry, the king needs six men.
You can't take him! It's like forever!
I can't take them and not take him.
No, you can't take him!
I won't let you!
- Lass, lass.
- It's two years! No! It's two years!
This is England's new venture in science, in trade, in discovery.
Who else but Sir Austin Byam's son should go?
But two years.
- I understand, my dear.
MAN: Ship ahoy!
Bob.
Behold! The elder son of the sea and heir to all its oceans.
Uniform by Jeeves.
[LAUGHING]
It's so new, it creaks.
I'll come back an admiral, with a necklace for you.
Pearls as big as coconuts.
I'll name a nice shiny island after you, Sir Joseph.
- I owe you for my appointment.
- You've been appointed for one purpose:
To make me a dictionary of the Tahitian language.
I've made that clear to Captain Bligh.
- What's he like, sir?
- Captain Bligh?
He's a seagoing disaster.
His hair is rope yarn.
His teeth are marlinespikes.
BYAM:
Marlinespikes? Good.
Sounds rather terrifying.
But perhaps, as your father used to say:
"A taut hand at sea is better than a slack one."
You'd have made a rare sailor, ma'am.
Why don't you stow away, Mother?
I've considered it. Very seriously.
Well, here's to the voyage
of the Bounty.
To the voyage of the Bounty!
Still waters and the great golden sea.
Flying fish like streaks of silver and mermaids that sing in the night.
The Southern Cross, and all the stars on the other side of the world.
Bless my soul.
To the voyage of the Bounty!
Is that the Bounty?
No, sir. That's the flagship of the fleet.
There's your little pint-pot.
BYAM:
That's the Bounty for Tahiti?
She isn't very big, is she?
It ain't the size that counts, youngster.
It's the salt in the lads that man it.
- Where's your sweetheart?
- She married a sailor.
Oh.
It's Ellison, sir.
He tried to break ship.
- On deck, Morrison.
- Aye, sir.
- Churchill.
- Aye, sir.
Break ship, would you?
I can't face it, sir. Not two years.
I might not come back.
Then she's left with the baby.
Flog me, send me to jail, but don't take me, sir!
Don't.
Now, listen to me, Ellison.
The sea's hard, but you whistle it off.
Do your spit and polish and you'll come home with the seals...
...following in admiration.
I was like you when I first came to sea,
Cumberland moss all over me.
Now it's turned to barnacles.
That's better.
On this voyage, if you get in trouble, come to me. I'll see you get justice.
But if you're wrong, look out for squalls.
Now, get your chin up.
Go on deck. Say goodbye to your wife.
- You've got her aboard, sir?
- And the baby.
- Come on. Shake a leg.
- Thank you, sir.
- So you're going to the South Seas?
- Aye.
Here. Take this with you.
You can buy your own island.
Ten shillings.
Ten? I ain't seen the king's face on a shilling for so long...
...l've forgotten which George it is, but
I'll take it and pay you when I get back.
Sailor! You're not coming back, not in this little half-walnut.
WOMAN:
Here you are. Diamond brooch.
Real gold, mister, owned by Captain Kidd.
With a map of the treasure under the works.
Here. Stand clear with the tinware, Joe.
You keep leeward of the ship's gentlemen.
All right, now. Ta-ta. Ta-ta!
Mr. Byam? I'm Fletcher Christian, lieutenant and master's mate.
- You'll be my instructor.
- Yes, in navigation and trigonometry.
You'll have a watch, keep order, go aloft to mend canvas, reef and furl.
Otherwise, your time is your own.
Mr. Christian, in my hands, the ship is safe.
I understand.
"A little child shall lead them."
Come along, I'll show you below. You there, take Mr. Byam's box to his berth.
- Ahoy, Mr. Christian!
CHRISTIAN: Ahoy!
Excuse me.
Good morning, sir.
Nothing lost, Mr. Christian.
Think I've got enough for a two years' voyage?
CHRISTIAN:
You know your draft better than I do.
My lad, nobody can estimate my draft, least of all myself.
- Easy, easy.
- What makes her roll so?
Here's a navy for you.
Rum in the skimmers today and blood in the scuppers tomorrow.
This is our ship's surgeon.
We call him Mr. Bacchus.
- He's never told us his real name.
- I've forgotten it.
Pleased to meet you.
Mr. Byam, I should never have gone ashore.
England's only an island, and all islands are alike.
I'm going below. Bear a hand.
Easy, now. Easy.
Oh, Tommy, I'm afeard.
This ship's unlucky.
They've changed the name.
Well, I changed your name, didn't I?
Was that unlucky?
Oh, Tommy.
One, two.... Three of us in here?
My dog at home has a bigger kennel all to himself.
I can see we shall be as friendly as tomcats in a sack.
Mr. Stewart? Mr. Byam.
Drop in anytime, Byam.
I'll be just 10 inches away from you.
- A pleasure, Mr. Stewart.
- I hope you'll like the ship.
- I'd like any ship, Mr. Stewart.
- Johnny Newcomer.
Oh, yes, Mr. Byam, the amiable Mr. Hayward.
- How do you do?
- Mr. Hayward has been two years at sea.
And a man who's been two years at sea should know how to lash his hammock.
Yours looks like a Frenchman's knapsack.
All right. On deck, all of you.
Mr. Maggs?
This here Captain Bligh, sir.
Now, you being ship's clerk...
...would you call him a gentle officer?
If I was you, I wouldn't be calling him anything.
Oh, no, no, no, Mr. Maggs, no.
Never call anybody anything.
But I do hope he is gentle because
I'm his messman and I frighten so easy.
It runs in our family, Mr. Maggs.
My mother was frightened by my father before I was born...
...and I've been frightened ever since.
Do you know there's times when
I can hardly hold a glass in my hand?
- Silence. The captain's coming aboard.
- Oh, oh.
[WHISTLE BLOWING]
MAN:
Company, atten!
Mr. Christian, clear the decks of this rabble.
Very good, sir. Clear decks.
Everybody ashore. Clear decks.
- Mr. Fryer, we sail at six bells.
- Sail at six bells.
- We got our rights here.
- Off ship, Joe. Off ship.
I'm not going until the ship sails.
Hey, you can't do that!
Flogging through the fleet.
We're included.
- A compliment to the Bounty, Sir Joseph.
- Yes.
Mr. Christian, pipe the ship's company at five bells to witness punishment.
Would you care to see the flogging?
No. The only discipline
I know is science.
There's science in using a cat-o'-nine-tails. Watch my boatswain.
I really must be off.
I came aboard merely to introduce Roger.
Goodbye, my boy.
This won't be all cakes and ale, Roger...
...but your family's followed the sea for seven generations.
Not one ever failed in his duty.
In a tight place, that's all you'll need to remember.
- I'll try to, sir.
- Sure you will, my boy.
- Goodbye, Mr. Bligh.
- Goodbye, Sir Joseph.
What does it mean, sir,
"flogging through the fleet"?
Sentence of court-martial, two dozen lashes at each ship.
What was the man's crime, sir?
Struck his captain.
But that's over 300 lashes.
I don't understand why--
Can you understand this?
Discipline's the thing.
A seaman's a seaman, captain's a captain. And a midshipman...
...is the lowest form of animal life in the British navy.
Now you know what a midshipman is.
[BELL RINGING]
[DRUM ROLLING]
MAN 1:
Line up!
MAN 2:
Port oars!
Ship's company, off hats!
Article 22: "If any officer, mariner or other person in the fleet...
...shall strike or offer to strike any of his superiors...
...and being convicted, he shall suffer punishment...
...inflicted on him by the sentence of a court-martial."
Ship's company, on hats!
- Mr. Morrison, two dozen, I believe.
- Two dozen it is, sir.
- The man is dead, sir.
- Dead?
- Shall I dismiss the men, sir?
- What?
Certainly not.
We'll proceed with punishment.
Boatswain, do your duty.
Come along with you. Do your duty!
[WHIP CRACKING]
Bloody murderer.
Mr. Byam!
MORRISON: Punishment counted out, sir.
- Mr. Morrison, come aboard.
- Mr. Fryer, make ready to sail.
- Starboard watch, secure for sea.
Starboard watch, shorten and cable!
Stand by to go aloft!
In captain's gig, Mr. Christian.
Both watches, hoist!
FRYER: Hoist away!
- Topsails.
Way aloft!
Winds offshore!
You'll take the mizzenmast, Mr. Byam.
What's the matter, afraid to go aloft?
Why, it's child's play.
That man they flogged.
He was dead.
Get aloft. Bear a hand.
Mr. Morrison, start those men.
[MEN SINGING]
Tallyho!
Child's play.
MAN:
Anchors aweigh, sir.
Let fall!
Down from aloft!
Down from there! A dozen for the coat of the last man down!
Please, sir!
CHRISTIAN:
Skipper Hayward!
Mr. Hayward!
- I'll take care of him.
- Keep hold!
Hoist away!
Set courses, royals and gallants!
FRYER:
Royals and gallants!
Starboard bridges, aweigh with the anchors.
- Ship ready.
- Give her lee helm.
Lee helm, sir.
- Steady.
- Steady, sir.
There she goes. Her anchor's up.
Oh, Mary, it's such a little ship.
My Tommy will bring her home.
ALL:
Hurrah!
Hurrah!
- We're under canvas again, Mr. Christian.
- Yes, sir.
- It's our third voyage together.
- Not of my choosing.
So the port admiral told me.
Well, you're here. I requested you.
I like having a gentleman as my subordinate, being a self-made man.
I admire you for that, sir.
And for very little else?
Sailing orders?
Tahiti direct by Cape Horn.
Winds permitting.
If we can't make westing, we shall have to go by Africa.
Then we'll have to get supplies at Simon's Bay.
We'll need them. This ship has less food than a prison hull.
And I don't trust that clerk of yours.
Who asked you to meddle with my clerk?
Can't get much from a hungry man.
I have to work these men we feed.
Rascals and pirates.
Did you see them growl at the flogging?
I'll teach them what flogging's like.
My advice, sir, if you'll take it, is not to be too harsh with them.
We're sailing 10,000 miles together for the next two years.
- It's like a powder magazine.
- I don't want your advice.
I've my own way with seamen.
They respect one law, the law of fear.
- My officers should remember that.
- I can only tell you what I think!
They come from jails and taverns, but they're English and they'll sail anywhere.
I'm not interested in what you think.
I expect you to carry out whatever orders I give, whenever I give them.
I'll carry out your orders, Mr. Bligh.
Then we understand each other?
Perfectly.
- Any orders for the deck?
- No.
- That all?
- Yes. You may go.
Thank you, sir.
- She's flying, Mr. Christian.
- Tahiti direct, sir.
Tahiti direct, Mr. Christian.
Pass it on: No change of sail without my orders.
Put two men at the wheel.
- We'll carry on or carry under.
- Very good, sir.
- Southeast by east.
- Southeast by east, sir.
No change in sails...
- ...except for captain's orders.
- Good.
Mr. Byam, you'll stand by for midshipman's school.
Aye, aye, sir.
BLIGH:
You! Hold up, there!
Never empty your buckets into the wind!
Find the wind, you idiot!
Find the wind and then choose your rail.
Get below!
We're off around the world, boys.
Light hearts and tight britches.
Off around the world.
Oh, dry up, you cub.
Is it human, or what do you think?
I can't stand yowling water babies.
[SINGING "ROCK-A-BYE BABY"]
Blast you! I told you not to swing that lantern!
You don't mean it makes you seasick?
An old buccaneer like you? La-di-da.
I'll knock more tar out of you than it'll take a month to mix.
- Come on, blowhard.
- Oh, stow it, will you?
I can't make head or tail of this navigation.
Don't worry. If you get tangled,
I'll jump in and pull you out.
You'd better not try and fool
Mr. Christian.
Mr. Christian holds no terrors for me.
I can wade the seven seas and never wet my shirt.
They have whales that can sink a ship, but I can sink the whale.
Behold, the face that launched a thousand ships.
Gentlemen.
Today's navigating problem:
Given the altitude of Polaris, could you find your latitude, Mr. Stewart?
To lead up to it...
...ordinarily, the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.
Uh, but this is not true of navigation.
We must consider winds and currents--
Yes. Suppose you considered the problem.
STEWART: Yes, sir.
- Perhaps Mr. Stewart means that it's...
...like that lantern, sir.
We assume it should hang straight down, but because the ship is rolling...
...it swings to and fro.
But by watching it closely--
You disagree with Byam, Mr. Hayward?
He knows the lantern makes me seasick.
He's doing it to break up the lesson.
- Stewart doesn't know his problem.
- Still, his original theory interests me.
Please, sir.
Proceed, Mr. Byam. You were saying, by watching the lantern closely--
What seems to be the trouble,
Mr. Stewart?
Watch the wind, Mr. Stewart.
It's not there. It's there.
Is that the face that launched a thousand ships?
[HICCUPS]
One navigation problem and three wrecks.
Smart as paint, you are.
Why, you ungrateful swab.
After I've given my all for the honor of the class.
Byam!
It wasn't my fault.
He came behind and struck me.
- Is that true, Mr. Byam?
- I'd rather not say, sir.
So you want to fight?
I'll cool you off.
Get to the masthead and stay there until I call you down.
BYAM: All the way, sir?
- All the way.
- Get below or go aloft!
- Yes, sir!
Rather heavy weather to send him aloft, isn't it?
They must learn this isn't a beer garden.
If you don't teach them, I will!
Look alive, you crawling caterpillar!
- Where's Byam?
- I couldn't help it, Stewart.
When the man looks at me,
I want to jump overboard.
Where's Byam?
- The old man sent him aloft.
- You let him take the blame, huh?
Here, here!
You've started enough trouble!
Time you learn discipline!
Get into your hammock...
- ...before I put you over a gun!
- Yes, sir.
Get up!
You see, sir? It isn't my fault.
They're only jealous because
I've been at sea before.
Who did that?
I did, sir.
Come here.
Good.
[BELL RINGS]
How she creaks. Wind's a gale.
I'm too old to envy young Byam aloft.
- Splice the main-brace, Mr. Morgan.
- I'll take it to kill germs.
What? Waste my brandy?
Here, you use the ship's drinking water.
It would shrivel me wooden leg.
Did you ever hear how I lost my leg?
- No, no, but we will.
- Well--
- I'm worried about Byam.
- Oh, he'll weather it all right.
Well, I left my leg with
John Paul Jones back in '78.
We came astern with a Yankee.
Up went our colors and our captain hails,
"What ship is that?"
"American ship Ranger," roars Jones, and up go his colors.
"Louder, you Yankee pip-squeak," our captain yells.
"I can't hear you!"
"Can you hear this?" Says Jones, and he lets go a broadside.
Thundering guns.
You all right?
- Nothing lost, Mr. Christian.
- Look after him, Mr. Morgan.
Keep her head up!
MAN:
Starboard!
Get him below, to the surgeon!
Mr. Christian!
- Who brought that man down?
- I did, sir!
But I sent him aloft!
He's gone under. The top's no place.
I know his place. Time you knew yours.
Maintain discipline, not break it!
Send him aloft again!
Mr. Bligh, he's had enough!
Send him aloft again!
That's right, lad. Drink another.
You'll be as right as a truism.
If you'd lost a leg, now. ...
I lost mine in action against the French, off Jamaica.
A French surgeon did the trick for me.
He apologized in French, and I cursed him in English.
- How is he?
- I'm all right, sir.
He'll go anywhere.
Get to the masthead again, Byam.
- I've taken my punishment, sir.
- Get to the masthead!
I've had a bellyful of that masthead from Captain Bligh!
- You can't make me go back again!
- Byam.
It was Mr. Christian brought you down, lad.
Thank you, sir.
I didn't understand. Captain's orders.
- You mind?
- No. Let him have it.
Here, you'll need this.
Here's something else you'll need.
You're a plucky youngster.
If necessary, I'd be happy to cut off your leg anytime.
Thank you, sir.
- If anything happens to that lad, Bligh--
- Christian!
Christian, careful!
CHRISTIAN:
Ship's company, off hats.
O eternal God, who alone spreadest out the heavens...
...and rulest the raging sea, who has compassed the waters with bounds...
...until night and day come to an end...
...receive into thy almighty and most gracious protection...
...the persons of us, thy servants and the fleet in which we serve.
Preserve us from the dangers of the sea that we may be a safeguard...
...unto our gracious lord
King George and his kingdoms...
...and a security for such as pass on the seas upon their lawful occasions...
...and that we may return in safety to enjoy the blessings of the land...
...with a remembrance of thy mercies to praise and glorify thy holy name...
...through Jesus Christ our Lord, amen.
ALL: Amen.
- Ship's company, on hats.
The ship's company will bear in mind...
...we are at sea under the articles of war.
Perhaps you are unaware that the articles of war invest in me...
...the authority to order punishment.
During the recent heavy weather,
I've watched you at work on deck and aloft.
You don't know wood from canvas, and it seems that you don't want to learn.
Well, I'll have to give you a lesson.
You, you, you, step forward.
You three are a disgrace to saltwater!
Ten days on half rations.
What's your name?
- Thomas Burkitt, sir.
- He's a thief, sir. Dartmoor Prison.
- A thief.
- Convicted. Offered a choice:
Dartmoor Prison or the king's navy.
You've been to Dartmoor Prison, Burkitt?
- Yes, sir.
- It seems you prefer the navy.
You may regret that choice before this voyage is over. Your name?
Thomas Ellison, sir. Pressed into service.
I've got a wife, a baby.
I asked your name, not the history of your misfortunes. Your name?
- Smith.
- Not you, you idiot! You.
- William Muspratt, sir.
- Have you got a wife, Muspratt?
Have you got a wife?
Two, sir.
The ship's company will remember that
I am your captain, judge and your jury.
You do your duty and we may get along...
...but whatever happens, you'll do your duty. Go forward.
CHRISTIAN:
Lively, lads.
Thief. Nobody calls me a thief but the men I steals from.
Half rations.
You there!
Who did that?
I can't tell you, sir.
- Mr. Morrison.
- Aye, sir.
- Report that man for two dozen lashes.
- But....
I done it, sir.
Pick it up.
Put it back.
- Mr. Morrison, lay on with a will.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Bligh, these men aren't king-and-country volunteers.
They've been brought aboard by press gangs.
In a week, I'll get some spirit without flogging.
Teach them who's master and never let them forget.
- Mr. Morrison!
MORRISON: Aye.
Before we see port, I'll make them jump at a midshipman's jacket...
...even if it's hung on a broomstick to dry.
Give this man his two dozen. When I ask for information, I expect to get it.
- I didn't hear the watch call, sir.
- Why not?
Sorry, I was cleaning brass for Mr. Byam.
That's true, sir.
Stretch this man over a gun and give him two dozen lashes.
But I was responsible, sir.
Byam will be in charge of the punishment.
Two dozen.
That's enough, Mr. Morrison.
MAN: Man overboard!
- Bring a line!
Idiot. I'll have to teach my top men not to fall off the ship.
Mr. Morrison!
When you get him onboard, stretch him with a rail to dry him off.
I can't stand it. I got to get water.
Get back to your work.
I wanted water for my knees, sir.
I can't stand it. Please, sir.
- What is it?
- This man left his work. Wants water.
Look, sir, it's the sand worked in cruel.
- I wanted water to wash it.
- I'll give you water.
Mr. Morrison, keelhaul this man.
MAN:
Haul away!
- Well?
- The man is dead, Mr. Bligh.
Mr. Bligh, I've seen calms and doldrums, but not one like this in 40 years.
- The men in the boats are worn-out.
- Not the way they're pulling.
- Put new men into the boats.
- Mr. Morrison, pipe the men.
Change the boat crews.
Dive in with your mess, lads.
The boats are alongside.
Mr. Byam, look at this bit of meat, sir. It's alive.
I'm sorry, lad.
There's nothing I can do about it.
This bit of meat was mined in a rock quarry.
- Here, I'll change with you, lad.
- Thanks.
It's alive, all right...
...but they're fresh meat anyway.
Mr. Byam, I'm reporting these two men unfit for duty.
- Very good. You men are relieved.
BLIGH: What's the delay here?
You realize we're waiting for these men to pull us into a wind?
The men haven't finished mess, and these two are unfit for duty.
- Unfit?!
- My orders, sir.
If they can walk, they can work.
Put them in the boats and get these other men out immediately.
Any sign of a breeze, sir?
I'm about at the end of my rope.
Keep up your stroke, man.
I'll whistle a wind up for you.
[WHISTLING]
Can't we...?
- Can't we rest a spell, sir?
- No, and keep your hatch closed.
This is the cask with only one cheese in, sir.
- What's this? What's this?
- Two cheeses are gone.
- What?
- Two 50-pound cheeses missing.
- Stolen, of course, sir.
- Thieves and jailbirds!
- What?
- A hundred pounds of cheese gone.
They'd steal canvas off a corpse.
- Strange. I checked the stores myself.
- Cheeses can't fly, fool!
They've been stolen, of course.
Stop allowance of cheese until the theft is made up.
- Yes, sir.
- Pardon, sir. Back in Portsmouth...
...that cask was opened by you...
...and Mr. Maggs had the cheeses carried ashore.
- Silence!
- Perhaps you'll recollect, sir.
- Maggs had me take them to your house.
- You insolent scoundrel!
MAN: But I remember very well, sir.
I didn't get to see my wife that day.
Boatswain, spread-eagle that liar to the rigging till sundown.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Wind off the starboard bow, sir.
- Man the lee board braces!
ALL: Aye, aye, sir.
Here. Get that.
Well, Mr. Christian, if your rascals are any good, bring us into the wind.
Boats!
- Pull, lads! Pull!
- Lay into it, now. Get up.
Send her up, Burkitt. Pull!
CHRISTIAN:
Mr. Byam, pull up their strokes!
Pull! Pull!
- Mr. Hayward, speed up!
- Mr. Byam, use your rope's end!
CHRISTIAN: Come on, lads, pull!
- Come on, pick them up.
CHRISTIAN:
Pull!
We're almost in! Put your weight in it!
Good lad, Muspratt. Pull, lads!
We're in!
- We're in!
CHRISTIAN: Well done, there!
Shall I call the boats in, sir?
They've done their job.
What do you expect me to do, knight them? Hoist the boats.
- Aye, sir.
- Good, lads! Good, lads!
Well, we are out of the doldrums at last, sir.
I told you to spread-eagle that liar.
Why hasn't it been done?
Very good, sir.
Come along, McCoy.
[GROANING]
There's nothing more powerful than brandy.
I threw a brandy bottle overboard once, empty one, off the coast of Madagascar.
Three years later, I picked it up in a river in Portugal.
It had gone back to its home vineyard for more.
You would've made an excellent historian.
You have a profound contempt for facts.
BACCHUS: I don't despise facts, sir,
I'm indifferent to them.
[BELL RINGING]
Water. Water.
Cheese, Mr. Christian?
No, thank you, sir.
- Mr. Byam?
- No, thank you, sir.
- Mr. Fryer?
- No, thank you, sir.
Perhaps the surgeon wants cheese.
No, thank you, sir.
It's bad for my innards.
To the best of my recollection,
Mr. Christian, you're partial to cheese.
Not tonight, sir.
Burn me. I believe you're with the men.
If you'll allow me,
I think you've been unjust.
- Unjust?
BACCHUS: A bit of cheese, more or less.
Unjust? In other words, you say I'm the man who lied.
CHRISTIAN: I didn't say that, sir.
- You implied it.
I've no doubt that Maggs disposed of the cheeses without your knowledge...
...but I can't understand your treatment of the man who obeyed orders.
Maggs is my clerk. It's not for my men to question his orders.
Nor for you to question mine!
I want your apology.
I have nothing more to say, sir.
Then you can dine elsewhere on what you can get!
- Mr. Bligh.
- Byam.
Gentlemen.
Come, he implied it, didn't he, Mr. Byam?
Well, I can also dispense with your company!
Thank you, sir.
So you're all against me, officers and men.
Won't eat cheese, eh?
Before I'm done with you,
I'll make you eat grass!
I'm so hungry, if my mother would reach out to pet me...
...l'd have a bit of her hand.
There's fish there, all right, but they're making jokes about the bait.
You see--
If I could prove what I suspect, I--
No, I wouldn't.
I'm so weak, I'm peaceful.
Muspratt, Burkitt, look here, supper.
What?
Why--
Why, Mr. Christian, sir.
Take a look at this, sir.
Supper for six men.
Four pounds, they calls it.
If that weighs more than 2,
I'll eat the cat-o'-nine-tails.
- It ain't pig. It's horse meat.
- We pulled our hearts out for this breeze.
- And what do we get? We starve.
- Well, little meat, no distemper.
Keep the wind in the sails and out of your stomach.
If it's any comfort, the officers are in the same boat.
Not Captain Bligh.
He's getting fat, the dirty, thieving--
Burkitt!
Any more of that, and I'll clap you in irons.
Yes, sir.
Buckoes. Buckoes.
Here's your supper.
- Thompson, get your hook and line.
- Right.
See him? He's a big one, eh?
- Here you are, Burkitt.
- Right.
Well, we've got to have bait.
Sharks ain't seamen. They expect to eat.
We've got to have bait.
- You want to risk this for a meal?
- Aye.
- I'm willing.
- Yeah.
If the hook don't kill him, that pork will.
Let it go.
There he goes. There he goes.
- Got him.
- On deck with him.
- Easy, now. Easy, now. Easy, now.
- Hold him.
You first, Burkitt. Choose for your mess.
- Thanks, mates.
- Yeah, fine catch you've got there.
You know I must have a slice, eh?
- Shark eat shark?
- You forget yourself.
You give me a slice, a nice, large one, and I'll say nothing.
Tell him, you slimy quill-pusher.
Take your slice!
[VIOLIN PLAYS]
[GROANING]
[FOOTSTEPS]
At ease, lads. At ease.
Well, how's our shark-killer, huh?
He's cut to bits, sir.
He'll be all right. What's a flogging?
A few blows and a few "ohs," and then you put on your shirt.
- Here.
- Thank you, sir.
Now, if you'd lost a leg, my lad....
I left mine with a Spanish pirate off the coast of Trinidad.
A bullfighter did the trick for me.
He was so drunk he nearly cut off the wrong leg.
Hey! Here.
You'll be all right.
A bit tattooed on the back perhaps, but just the right style for Tahiti, eh?
- Hey, fiddler, give him a tune.
- Aye, sir.
- Good night, lads.
- Good night, sir.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[SINGING]
Listen, Byam. You can flog those fellows, starve them...
- ...but they'll bob up again with a fiddle.
- Music at sea...
...I never imagined how beautiful it was.
BLIGH: Master-at-arms, stop that infernal jamboree.
- It's worse than two cats on a fence.
MAN: Aye, aye, sir.
The old death's-head.
I've never known a better seaman, but as a man, he's a snake.
He doesn't punish for discipline.
He likes to see men crawl.
I'd like to push his poison down his own throat.
You both have one thing in common, the devil's own temper.
He can let his go...
...but whether I can keep mine bottled up for the next two years is a question.
I believe you will.
Whatever happens,
I'll always be glad I've known you.
I'll remember that when you're an admiral.
Good night, youngster.
Good night.
- More tea, sir?
- No, you get out.
Yes, sir.
- You sent for me, sir?
- Yes, I've got a job for you this morning.
- Sit down. Had your breakfast?
- Yes, thank you, sir.
I want you to sign the list of all supplies issued on the voyage.
Certify and sign.
We should raise the island anytime now.
Not a bad voyage so far.
All hands accounted for.
Only six down with scurvy.
Five with scurvy, one with flogging.
Correct, there's your credit.
Five with scurvy, one with flogging.
We're still under canvas.
Mr. Bligh, I can't sign this book.
No such amounts have been issued.
You've signed daybooks with extra kegs the ship never carried.
- I have, sir.
- And why not? We all do it.
We'd be fools if we didn't on a lieutenant's pay.
I want to stow away enough to keep me out of the gutter.
I understand, a captain's prerogative.
Ordinarily, I wouldn't mind.
Why is this case different?
The captains I've served with didn't starve their men.
They didn't save money by buying up the stinking meat.
They didn't buy yams that would sicken a pig.
Silence!
They didn't call their men thieves and flog them in the bone.
- Impudent scoundrel! Sign that book!
- I refuse...
...and you have no authority.
I haven't?! I'll show you authority.
Lay all hands aft! All hands aft!
Very good, sir.
Company, attend!
Mr. Christian, step forward.
"If any officer or other person in the fleet...
...shall disobey any lawful command...
...of any of his superior officers, every such person...
...being convicted of such offense shall suffer death...
...or other punishment as shall be inflicted on him...
...by the sentence of a court-martial."
Mr. Christian, you will sign this book.
Mr. Bligh...
...the ship's company will bear witness that I sign in obedience to your orders.
But remember, sir, I shall demand a court of inquiry in England.
You mutinous dog.
- Retract that, sir.
- I will repeat it. You're a mutinous dog.
- Mr. Christian.
- Land ho, sir!
Furl away!
MAN:
There she waits, lads!
- What is it, Mr. Fryer?
- Tahiti, you fool.
Oh.
So you'll face me with a court of inquiry?
We're a long way from England and what can happen on this ship...
...before we get there may surprise even you.
[SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
[SPEAKS TAHITIAN]
Milk! It's milk!
Captain, they got cows here that lays eggs. What a place.
Would you help me up, sir?
I'd like to see the island.
BACCHUS:
What for? All islands are alike.
That's a singularly stupid observation, sir, and grossly unscientific.
Well, science is one thing and experience is another.
- See one island, you've seen them all.
- Fiddlesticks.
Well, I'm to be first ashore.
Captain's orders, to begin my dictionary.
I'll get my trade goods.
We can go ashore together.
All right, then.
- I know that man.
- Who is he?
A friend of Captain Cook's when I was sailing master.
Hitihiti, chief of the island, priest of the temple. Pipe him aboard.
- Mr. Fryer, dress ship.
- Very good, sir. Dress ship!
[PIPE WHISTLING]
[SPEAKING TAHITIAN]
Bligh.
- Bligh.
- Hitihiti.
[SPEAKING TAHITIAN]
- Bligh, you got fat.
- Oh, well, it is 10 years...
...since we sailed together with Captain Cook.
[SPEAKS TAHITIAN]
- I beg your pardon?
- Where Captain Cook?
Uh, Captain Cook is dead.
- Morti?
- Yes, yes, morti.
[SPEAKS TAHITIAN]
- He was a good man.
- Oh, yes.
- Hail King George.
- King George?
[SPEAKS TAHITIAN]
Captain Cook say King George come on next English ship.
His Majesty is extremely sorry he couldn't come.
[SPEAKS TAHITIAN]
I beg your pardon?
My hat.
Captain Cook say if King George don't come, he send hat.
Yes, yes, yes! Of course, the hat.
Mr. Maggs, go to my cabin and bring me the hat--
- The cocked hat, you fool!
- Yes, sir.
The hat will be here in one moment.
So we shall require
1,000 breadfruit plants.
- Breadfruit? Uru.
- Correct, uru. Uru.
- All we have for you.
- Thank you, thank you.
We shall have to stay here for several months.
We shall have provision--
[SPEAKING TAHITIAN]
- They're welcome to anything.
- Don't be a fool.
- You'll need those gifts to make friends.
- Him no need gift, my friend.
- Me Hitihiti, you my tayo.
- Tayo?
BLIGH: Chief makes you his friend.
- In my tongue, close friend.
You live home, my home.
Tayo. Friend, the finest word in any language.
- It shall be the first in my dictionary.
MAGGS: The hat.
Yes, thank you.
With the compliments of His Majesty
King George I I I of Great Britain.
[SPEAKING TAHITIAN]
- Byam, you come ashore with me.
- Sir?
Permission granted, mind you report...
- ...onboard ship every night.
- Very good.
- Byam will live with my family.
- Impossible.
- I can have no favorites aboard my ship.
- Bligh, you are chief on this ship...
...but I am chief on that island.
Byam will come with me, yes?
Perhaps that's best. Permission granted.
By the way, Mr. Morrison, pipe the ship's company aft.
MORRISON:
Aye, aye, sir. All hands aft.
[PIPE WHISTLING]
Well, we're here. Tahiti at last.
England to Cape Horn,
Africa, New Zealand...
...Van Diemen's Land and the great South Seas.
I've sailed the Bounty over 27,000 miles...
...and you think you've come to an island paradise...
...a tropical grog shop of feast and song and sleep.
Well, you're wrong!
You're here to labor.
You'll fill this ship with breadfruit trees.
You'll recondition her for sea.
Shore leave permitted if and when I can spare you.
If you abuse it, you'll answer to me.
Remember, your work is finished when we drop anchor in Portsmouth Harbor.
Mr. Fryer will have charge of work ashore.
Very good, sir.
Mr. Christian, you will remain onboard in charge of reconditioning the ship.
Unfortunately, you will have no shore leave while we're here at Tahiti.
That's all.

[SPEAKS TAHITIAN]
Your language is most un-English.
It means exactly what it says.
Here are three pages on your words meaning "look."
- Plenty kind of look.
- That's the trouble.
There's one for the downcast eyes, one for the sidelong glance...
...one that invites, one that consents.
A whole language of looks.
Byam, you think too much.
One day, you head go crack.
[SPEAKS TAHITIAN]
No, no, no, Tehani. I've told you before.
I like my flowers in a bowl.
Now, scat. I'm busy.
What do you call that look, Byam?
The look of a charming girl who will still be happy...
...when we English invaders go home.
By the way, what's your word for money?
Money? What is money?
All right, I'll explain. Which would you choose? The shilling or the nail?
Oh, no, Hitihiti. With one of these you can buy 20 of these.
- Oh? Where?
- Well, in England.
You see, in England, you must have money to live with to buy food.
In island of England, no fruit on tree?
- No fish in the sea?
- Oh, yes. Plenty.
No money, no food?
- That's right.
- I stay here.
MAN:
Byam, ahoy!
Sounds like Christian.
- Well, it can't be.
- Maybe so.
Hitihiti, you got him leave!
Byam!
Fletcher!
CHRISTIAN: Ahoy, Robinson Crusoe.
- Fletcher!
I'd given up on seeing you ashore and Hitihiti never even winked.
When he came aboard wearing that hat, even the articles of war failed Mr. Bligh.
HITIHITI:
Christian. Christian. Lieutenant.
Thank you for speaking to the captain.
The sea is good, but the earth is good also. Be at home.
It's good to be ashore again.
I've been as restless as....
CHRISTIAN: Can you speak Tahitian yet?
BYAM: Like a native.
Why, you little powder monkey!
If you cross my hawse again, I'll spank your little starboard, understand?
- Yes.
- Yes?
- Well, I didn't know you speak English.
- Yes.
- You must think me a perfect fool.
- Yes.
- Well, does she or doesn't she?
- Yes. She speak English. One word: yes.

[BYAM SPEAKING TAHITIAN]
[SPEAKS TAHITIAN]
- What did she say?
- You must be a king in your country.
What?
If His Majesty could see her...
...as I see her now, he'd forgive the error.
- Shall I tell her that?
- No, no. Just say thank you.
[BYAM SPEAKING TAHITIAN]
Byam...
...your friend is wise.
He looks, he understand.
You make word, you understand nothing.
No work today. Go swim, all.
Come along, Fletcher. I'll show you an island you'll never forget.
[SPEAKS TAHITIAN]

Aren't they amazing? I never knew there were such people in the world.

I was just thinking...
...what a contrast to the ship.

Tehani wants to race me. Come on!
[LAUGHING]
[SPEAKING TAHITIAN]
- Oh.
- What's wrong?
He comes from the ship.
- Captain Bligh's orders.
- Bligh?
You're to report onboard immediately.
Oh, I am? Byam, I know his game!
He gives me leave and recalls it to devil me into insubordination. I'll oblige him!
I'll have one day off that ship if I swing for it! Tell him I refuse!
[SPEAKS TAHITIAN]
What did she say?
The man will tell Captain Bligh you can't be found.
Oh, thank you.
I'm sorry I lost my temper.
[SPEAKS TAHITIAN]
She says you were magnificent, like a storm at sea.
- Thanks for your kindness.
- You will come again?
That rests with you and the captain.
- You will come again.
- Thank you.

- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Mr. Stewart.
Mr. Bligh wishes you to report to him as soon as you come aboard, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Stewart.
- Reporting, sir.
- You relieve my anxiety.
I was about to send an armed shore party to look for you.
- I had your permission, sir.
- You're a fine figure of a king's officer.
If I could prove to that native you're a liar, they'd arrest you! You'll regret this!
Before this voyage is over, you'll know who's master here!
Mr. Bligh, I have in mind the dead seaman you had flogged in Portsmouth.
He struck his captain.
You'd like me to strike you.
- Well, I won't do it.
- Very clever, Mr. Christian.
1,000 plants, sir. The pick of the island!
Mr. Morgan, I shall commend your industry to Sir Joseph Banks.
Thank you. There's one difficulty, sir, a very grave one.
These growing plants require more water than we can store aboard.
We can't let them die, sir.
We won't.
Mr. Morgan, I'll take these trees to the West Indies...
...every tree in prime condition.
I shall cut the water allowance for the entire ship's company.
Good morrow to you.
I'll drink your health in Portsmouth!
- Put your stuff there.
- It's mine, sir. It's a gift.
Captain's orders.
Put it down and go forward!
Shore leave in heaven, duty in hell again.
- What have you got there?
- Monday Wash, sir.
It's a pet, sir.
Her name's Monday Wash.
Mr. Maggs, take that laundry for the captain's table.
But, sir! Oh!
Now get forward!
- Come along, there. Hurry!
- Did he hurt you?
No, but one day,
I'll take that cane away--
Look behind you.
[MUSIC BO? PLAYS]
[SPEAKING TAHITIAN]
Yes.
Aren't you coming aboard, Hitihiti?
I have said farewell to Bligh.
I have sent gift to King George.
- Then this is goodbye.
- Yes.
Byam, tayo.
- You have been happy here?
- Very happy, Hitihiti.
Byam, I have no son.
Stay here with me. Be my son.
I must return to England.
I shall never come back.

- Look.
- Big as gooseberries!
Make her understand.
These are priceless, I can't take them.
[SPEAKS TAHITIAN]
She says they're for your mother.
Oh. Well, thank her, Roger.
And tell her when this voyage is over, somehow, I'm coming back.
- I can't tell her that.
- I mean it, Roger.
But it's a dream, Fletcher.
This island isn't real for you and me.
It's the ship that's real.
It's taking us home.
Tell her, Roger.
[SPEAKING TAHITIAN]
Thank you, Roger.
[SPEAKS TAHITIAN]
Goodbye, Maimiti.
That's right. No tears, lass.
Love?

Goodbye.
Reporting with deserters. Taken on the other side of the island. No resistance.
BLIGH:
Very well, Mr. Young.
So you let them take you alive.
You'll regret that, me lads.
Take them below.
BURKITT:
We ain't deserters, sir.
You kept us aboard because we dropped that tub of breadfruit.
- We wanted to see the island--
- Take them below and put them in irons.
Prisoners in escort, into file.
Left, turn!
Quick march!
- Is she ready for sea, Mr. Fryer?
- Ready, sir.
- Set topsails and jibs.
- Stand by. Topsails and jibs.
MAN:
All hands on deck!
[PIPE WHISTLING]
Looking about me, I can't believe we're in a ship of the royal navy.
The deck's like a barnyard!
Paradise is astern, gentlemen.
I'll break the men of that island if I have to flog every thieving--
Which reminds me...
...10 coconuts, Crown property, were stolen on your watch.
Correct, Mr. Maggs?
MAGGS: I counted myself.
- I'll account for the men in my watch.
- They didn't take them.
- Can you account for yourself?
Mr. Bligh, may I recall the outward voyage?
Harsh things were said, but I hoped the return trip would be better.
Then suppose you return the 10 coconuts.
- You think I'm so fond of them I'd steal?
- Yes, you hypocrite.
You stole Crown property more valuable.
- Explain that!
- Pearls, Mr. Christian.
- Pearls?
BLIGH: I believe I said pearls.
Fortunately, Mr. Maggs was at the boat.
He saw that native woman give you two pearls.
I think I'm beginning to understand.
The native woman, as you call her, gave the pearls to me.
- They are not Crown property.
- The goods I gave away to the natives...
...belong to the Crown.
What comes back belongs to the Crown!
I'm not the most patient man in the world. Give them to me!
Remember, Mr. Bligh:
Crown property.
Very well, Mr. Christian.
Crown property.
- Gratings rigged.
- Everybody present?
- Everyone present, sir, but the surgeon.
- Huh?
The surgeon is ill, sir.
- Ill? Drunk, you mean!
- We had to bleed him this morning, sir.
He's not fit.
Mr. Morgan and Mr. Christian agree.
Go below.
Tell him to report on deck at once!
Very good, sir.
Thomas Burkitt, Matthew Thompson, step forward.
CHRISTIAN:
Ship's company, off hats.
I'm sorry, sir.
Captain Bligh....
How do you feel?
I'm afraid I'm a very old man, lad...
- ...and a very sick one.
- I'll tell him again you can't report.
No, boy. No, I'm not worth getting into a scrape over.
For once, a midshipman gives an order.
You stay where you are.
A good lad.
I must pull him out.
I've taken the liberty of telling the surgeon to stay. He's not able to report.
I'll have no drunken relic holding up the discipline aboard my ship.
Once more, bring him on deck, or I'll have you seized up and flogged.
Byam doesn't wanna disobey you.
I beg you, don't force the old man.
He can't walk.
- Go below and see for yourself.
- Are you presuming to give me orders?
BACCHUS:
Reporting on deck for duty, sir.
Mr. Morrison, do your duty.
Four dozen, I believe.
Four dozen it is, sir.
Nothing lost, Mr. Christian.
- Well?
- What did you expect, Mr. Bligh?
The man's dead.
I call this ship's company to bear witness.
- You killed him!
- Silence.
Ship's company dismissed.
Boatswain, punishment postponed
24 hours.
Aye, aye, sir.
Do you hear, men?
Ship's company dismissed!
Bear a hand. Take him below.
Drunkard?
Yes, but everybody loved him.
The welfare of men on shipboard...
...depends upon things that seem small.
A joke at the right moment.
A glass of grog.
A kind word would do more with seamen than the cat-o'-nine-tails.
And this ship will be the worse...
...if possible, for his death.
Wonder if that's Defoe Island.
The natives are cannibals...
...but it's land.
The last we'll see for months.
You'd better get some rest.
You've been here for hours.
No. I can't sleep, and it's nearly my watch.
- Well, good night.
- Roger.
- There's something I want you to do.
- Gladly. What is it?
One never knows what may happen on a voyage like this.
If for any reason I don't return to England,
I want you to see my parents.
Well, why shouldn't you return to England?
Why?
I can't stand this devil's work much longer.
One day I'll forget this discipline and break his neck.
Wait until we're back in England.
The admiralty will save you the trouble.
Well, in any case,
I'd like you to see my parents.
- Of course. Where do they live?
- In Cumberland at Maincordare.
I've almost forgotten what the old place looks like.
I haven't seen it in 10 years.
But I do remember a tapestry in the hall...
...with ships and islands on it.
Perhaps that's what sent me off to sea.
I don't know.
In any case, I'd like you to see my home.
If anything should happen, tell my father and mother you knew me.
- You can count on me.
CHRISTIAN: Good. That's settled, then.
BLIGH: Mr. Byam, you're up late.
- It's fairly warm below.
I hadn't noticed. A true sailor can sleep in an oven or on ice. Get below.
Very good, sir.
[BELL RINGING]
Your watch, Mr. Christian.
And I must count the coconuts.
McCOY:
Mr. Christian, sir.
That shark's been following us since the surgeon died, waiting for the burial.
- Couldn't I have a musket to shoot it?
- Take the deck.
- I'll get the keys to the arms chest.
- Two muskets.
- I'd like to shoot that shark onboard.
- McCoy!
It's no use. Now's our chance.
There's a lot of us here ready. And the officers and men that won't join us....
- Well, it's them or us!
- Keep your hatch closed!
Now, get forward!

Sailor hand, mate.
- Hey, what's this noise about here?
- Water, mate.

- For deserters?
- But the lad slipped his cable.
Well, here's to you slipping yours.
When I'm free, I'll wring your scrawny pipe stem till your tongue pops out!
Tongue, is it? I'll give you something to remind you of that slice of shark.

You scum! Get out!
I'm sorry, lad.
Are you all right?
Thank you, Mr. Christian, sir.
Better take care of Thompson, sir.
Murdering butcher!
I've had enough of this blood ship!
He's not master of life and death on a quarterdeck above the angels. McCoy!
Quintal!
I'm sick of blood! Bloody backs!
Bloody faces!
Bligh, you've given your last command!
We'll be men again if we hang for it!
- You say you're ready for anything?
- Aye!
- Release them!
- You're taking the ship?
Mutiny?
Yes, mutiny! Pass the word.
Seize the arms chest.
MAN:
We've been waiting for this!
[WHISTLING]
No! Don't hit me!
Take him!
Boatswain!
No, no, don't hurt me! Don't hurt me!
Now, wake up! Get into your clothes and lose no time about it.
- What's the matter?
- What's happened?
- Have we been attacked?
- No, we've taken the ship.
And old Bligh's a prisoner.
Mutiny?
Tie him to the pipe.
Mr. Morrison! Mr. Coleman!
Shut up or I'll shut your trap for you!
Give up this madness, or we'll all be murdered.
You're in no danger.
What will we do with him?
- Shoot him!
- I'll slit his dirty throat!
See that, you butcher? My four dozen.
We'll give you 400.
- We'll let you know what it feels like!
ELLISON: Flog him!
You old rogue. You'd flog us.
You'd make us eat grass.
You bluenosed baboon!
Back! Back, all of you!
No more flogging aboard this ship.
That's why we're taking it.
We'll have something to say about that!
What will you do with him?
Put him in a launch and cast him adrift.
Give him food, water, cutlasses and a compass.
You can have your choice.
Go with him or stay with me.
No. Slit his throat, I say, and feed him to the sharks.
And I say go forward!
Clear the launch and lower away!
Aye, aye, sir.
- Stand by, Thompson.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Lively, old buzzing bees.
What a pity, what a pity!
Every little tree, perfect.
- You'll be sure to water them?
- Never you fret. We'll water them.

MAN: We'll take care of your plants, here, Morgan!
You may stay onboard if you like, without joining us.
No, thank you, sir.
All right. Your turn, Mr. Bligh.
Mr. Christian, I give you your last chance to return to duty.
I'll take my chance against the law.
You'll take yours against the sea.
But you're taking my ship! My ship!
Your ship? The king's ship, you mean, and you're not fit to command it.
Into the boat!
We're ready, Churchill.
Bear a hand here, will you?
[GUNFIRE]
McCoy! McCoy!
CHURCHILL: Two little monkey jackets.
Loyal to Captain Bligh, eh?
MUSPRATT: Serves them right.
- Come on, lads, on deck.
MORRISON:
I tell you, we will!
Mr. Christian, you forgot us.
Call back the boat.
There's no more room.
You must stay with us.
- We'll join our captain!
- We're not mutineers!
I said there was no more room!
Take them below!

You're sending me to my doom, eh?
Well, you're wrong, Christian!
I'll take this boat as she floats to England if I must!
I'll live to see you, all of you...
...hanging from the highest yardarm in the British fleet!
Yardarms, is it? I'll give you yardarms.
Burkitt!
You're not leaving them adrift?
They'll starve or drown.
- That's Bligh's affair.
- Your friends, Morgan, Purcell--
Do you think I wanted this?
- Call back the boat.
- No.
- Call it back!
- No!
These men have been in hell.
I couldn't stand it.
- Then I must go with Bligh.
- There's no room.
Then I call on you men.
All of you, in the name of the king, return to duty.

Hey, Thompson!
Here comes their water!
Sit down, Roger.
You know, there are five other men onboard...
...who refused to take part in the mutiny.
They've agreed not to try and retake the ship.
You may have your liberty under the same conditions.
I simply want your word for it.
You may have it.
But I'll escape if I can.
I understand.
Then I may go?
Yes, you may go.
Roger...
...l'm sorry I had to hit you.
That didn't hurt.
What hurts is that you and l can never again be friends.
Keep her as she goes, west-northwest.
West-northwest, sir.
I presume you'll make for the nearest island.
No. That's certain death. The savages in these parts are fierce cannibals.
We must keep well clear of those fellas.
By my reckoning, the first port from which we can expect help is Timor...
...in the Dutch East Indies, some 3500 miles away.
Then our case is hopeless.
It is by no means hopeless.
We have extra canvas, rope, a tool chest.
We'll put on every rag of sail.
That's impossible. Deeply laden as we are, we'd fill with the first storm.
Then we'll bail with our hands if we must.
She'll see us through if we do our part, she will!
Begging your pardon, sir, but the food and the water.
We haven't got enough for 10 days.
If we are to reach Timor alive, we must make it last 20, 40, 50 days.
It's the sea against us.
Mr. Bligh, we'd be pleased if you'd ask God's blessing on our journey.
That I shall do, Mr. Fryer.
Almighty God, thou knowest our need.
Grant we acquit ourselves like men...
...in the trials and dangers that lie before us.
Bail!
[SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
Bail!
Bail faster!
Bail faster! Bail!
Another piece, Mr. Maggs.
Thank you.
Thank you, lad.
Are we all served?
All served, sir.
Now, lads, for your own good, eat and drink slowly.
How far have we still to go, sir?
Don't let your mind dwell upon that, lad.
Think how far we've come.
We'll never see Portsmouth again?
We'll see Portsmouth again...
...and we'll see Fletcher Christian hanging from a yardarm...
...and every pirate with him.
Steady, mates.
Steady.
[SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
- Mr. Fryer, take the tiller.
- Aye, sir.
Get away! I caught him!
Hey, lads! Give me that bird!
Share and share alike, lads.
The blood for the sick.
Raise him up, Mr. Maggs.
Norton, get me a cup.
This will nourish you, Mr. Morgan.
No, thank you, sir.
Give it to the youngsters.
They need it more.
Yes, Mr. Morgan, but I'm still giving the orders.
Timor, up ahead.

Up with you. Up with you.

Did you hear that, mate? British.
- British?
- She's coming for us.
We've got a chance.
The wind's against her.
She must lay outside the reef till morning.
Get your families and your goods together!
Get aboard the Bounty!
Thompson, everyone onboard?
Burkitt and Muspratt have gone into hiding.
The fools! They'll be taken and hanged.
Get in the boat.
Where are you taking us?
I don't know. The Pacific is filled with uncharted islands.
We'll find one and settle there for good.
Mr. Christian, I've got a wife and child in England. I've got to get back.
Back? You know what that means?
A yardarm.
I must take that chance, sir.
But whatever happens,
I'll never blame you.
Thanks, lad, and I understand.
Good luck.
Well, this is goodbye, youngster.
We'll never see each other again, that's certain.
- But I'll remember.
- I will too, Fletcher.
When you're back in England with the fleet...
...you'll hear the hue and cry against me.
From now on, they'll spell mutiny with my name.
I regret that...
...but not the taking of the ship.
Every time I think of Bligh....
Well, I'd do it again.
If ever I reach England again,
I'll go to your father and tell him the truth.
Thanks.
- I'll be happier knowing that.
- Fletcher.
What is out there for you?
Another island.
- Stand by. I'll be back in a moment.
- Hurry up, Byam.
When she comes around the headland, we'll pilot her in.
[SPEAKS TAHITIAN]
Oh, Tehani, I'll be back in two hours.
Tehani knows.
[SPEAKS TAHITIAN]
The ship may be here for months before she sails.
But she will sail.
Byam, midshipman. Tehani knows.
Tehani, you're my wife, always.
Mrs. Roger Byam.
My wife, my darling.
[SHOUTS IN TAHITIAN]
There she is, lads, and we've nothing to fear.
We took no part in the mutiny.
Soon we'll be in England.
Thank God! Thank God!
We're returning. Good, eh?
Very good, sir. My name's Byam,
Roger Byam. This is Mr. Stewart.
We're midshipmen of His Majesty's ship, Bounty.
BLIGH:
Bring those men up!
Captain Bligh, thank God you're alive, sir.
They gave me a boat and a sail, didn't they?
Where is Fletcher Christian?
He sailed yesterday, sir, when your ship was sighted.
- Where to?
- I don't know, sir.
- You don't know, Stewart?
- I don't know either.
You're lying, both of you.
Sergeant, put these men in irons.
- Irons? What for?
- Mutiny.
But we're not mutineers.
A court-martial in England will decide that.
- We're as loyal as you.
- A court-martial will decide that!
We're reporting for duty!
If we're guilty, we'd go with Christian.
When Christian took my ship, you remained with him...
...and you'll have to answer for it.
It'll be better to tell me where he's gone!
- We don't know, sir.
- Then you'll lie in the hold...
...until you do know.
Sergeant, take them below!
MORRISON:
By the mark, 12! Rocky bottom!
- To the lee helm.
- Lee helm, sir.
- Steady!
- Steady, sir.
Mark 12!
- Foretop, any sail in sight?
- No sail, sir.
- Banktop!
- No sail, sir.
MORRISON:
By the mark, 12! Reefs ahead!
Mr. Byam, I can't understand why he keeps us below here in irons.
You and Mr. Stewart, McIntosh,
Coleman, Byrne and myself...
...we are no mutineers.
Haven't I told him that time and time again?
His marines surprised me and Muspratt, sir, or we wouldn't be here, alive.
MORRISON:
Reefs ahead!
BLIGH:
Attention below.
Have you decided to tell me where Christian sailed for?
MORRISON:
By the mark, 12! Reefs ahead!
Well, I'm waiting!
Well, stay here and rot.
My watch, I believe, Mr. Christian.
Very well, Mr. Young.
[YELLS IN TAHITIAN]
- You heathen slime!
- Enough!
[SPEAKS TAHITIAN]
I'm sorry, sir.
Mr. Christian, sir, when are you going to make a landfall?
We're fierce sick of this.
It's more than man can stand...
...to be at sea forever in a ghost ship.
I've steered off the track of ships.
When it's safe, I'll put about for the island.
Until then you've got to trust me, that's all.
Deep 11. Rocky bottom!
I beg you again to give up the search.
The Bounty must be lost. The ship's dragging barnacles. The seams are open.
Men are working the pumps day and night.
- We're still afloat, are we not?
- Only by the grace of God in these reefs.
- Ease her off a point.
MAN: Ease her off a point, sir.
I must remind you this is one of His Majesty's ships.
Mr. Edwards, I intend to bring back
Fletcher Christian.
Unless he's hanging from a yardarm, not one of His Majesty's ships is safe.
Mutiny and piracy will be rampant in the fleet.
- But we'll lose the ship.
- Then we'll lose it!
As long as I have a deck under me,
I'll search for that man.
Fourteen!
MAN:
To starboard!
Old Bligh's a seaman.
The rocks are so thick, a fish couldn't swim between them...
- ...without rubbing off his scales.
MORRISON: By the mark, 8!
Eight fathom! Let's hope we're moored before night...
...or the sharks will have us.
MORRISON:
By the mark, 2!
MAN 1:
Breakers ahead.
MAN 2:
Hard alee!
What's happened?
- Hard to port!
- Very good, sir!
Haul out both of them!
Get the doors!
Captain Bligh!
Get us out! We'll drown!
Lift with them and turn around!
Captain Bligh! Let us out of here!
Save your voice, man!
Take charge of the aft boat.
Captain Bligh, get us out of here!
- Get those men out!
- Aye, aye, sir! Come on, men!
[SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
Hurry up, soldier!
- The first boat's ready.
- Take them out.
Make for the Australian coast.
Prisoners go with me in the other boat.
- Very good, sir. God be with you.
- God be with you.
Hurry up with you down there.
Thank you. You saved our lives.
Mr. Byam, I wouldn't lose you for a flagship. Get into the boat!
MAN 1:
How long has this trial been going on?
MAN 2: About a week now.
They should reach a verdict soon.
Oh, there, there, child.
But they won't let me see him.
Why won't they let me see him?
If I could see him to talk to him, he'd know I trust him.
- He knows that, darling.
- Oh, but it's cruel. Cruel.
They can't hang him!
[GUNFIRE]
MAN 3: There's the signal.
The trial is opened again.
On the 15th day of September, 1792...
...for mutiny on His Majesty's ship,
Bounty.
MAN:
Call Mr. Fryer.
Mr. Fryer.
Do you swear by God any evidence you give...?
MAN: Besides the leader, did you see any of the prisoners now before this court...
...in arms?
FRYER: Yes, milord.
MAN: Inform the court.
FRYER: Seaman Burkitt and Seaman
Muspratt were armed with muskets.
Seaman Ellison was armed with a bayonet.
MAN: Have any of the accused any questions to put to this witness?
Yes, milord.
Good morning, Mr. Fryer.
Oh, good morning, lad.
Mr. Fryer, you say I was armed with a bayonet.
- Did you see me use it?
- By no means, lad.
MAN: Address your replies to the court.
- Milord, he didn't use the bayonet.
He merely flourished it under Captain Bligh's nose...
...and called him a few names.
Names? What names did he call him?
Sir, he--
He called him a bluenosed baboon.
[LAUGHING]
Have you any more questions to ask the witness?
ELLISON:
No, milord.
That is all.
Milord, I should like to ask a few questions of Captain Bligh.
Very well, Captain Nelson.
- Call Captain Bligh.
- Captain Bligh.
Captain Bligh, in the previous evidence given before this court...
...you failed to make clear one very important point:
A motive for the mutiny.
Can you tell us why your men took your ship?
No, sir. Until I was seized in the cabin, I suspected nothing.
A circumstance occurred the night before...
...which should have aroused my suspicions.
Going on deck, I found Fletcher Christian and Roger Byam...
...talking together at the rail.
I heard Roger Byam say,
"You can count on me."
I heard Christian reply,
"Good. That's settled."
I saw them shake hands.
I realized afterwards they were plotting to seize the Bounty.
But that's not true, Captain Bligh.
Milord, gentlemen, let me explain.
If the prisoner so desires, he may question the witness.
Captain Bligh, you've not repeated my whole talk with Fletcher Christian.
Did you not hear him tell me about his home in Cumberland?
I did not.
Well, did you not hear him ask my promise...
...that if he did not return, I would tell his parents what had happened?
I did not.
I swear before God and before this court...
...that was the content of my talk with Christian.
It had nothing to do with mutiny.
Captain Bligh, apart from the conversation you overheard...
...was Mr. Byam's previous conduct such that you believe him guilty?
Sir, his entire conduct convinces me that he plotted with Christian.
They were friends before the mutiny.
They remained friends after the mutiny.
When I arrived, the prisoner could've arrested Christian.
But he allowed him to escape.
On his own admittance.
Yes, but you knew I was trapped on the island, perhaps for years.
Outnumbered, unarmed.
I gave my word to Christian not to move against him.
Mr. Byam, if you were loyal when Christian escaped...
...I should have found you dead.
I have nothing more to ask him.
I can only say again to this court,
I am not guilty of mutiny.
If that is so, why did you not join your captain when he was cast adrift?
I was below planning a counterattack to regain the ship from the mutineers.
With whom did you plan the attack?
Sir, with my messmate,
Midshipman Stewart.
Milord...
...Midshipman Stewart died in the Pandora's boat.
"The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want."
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.
[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
Can't they ever reach a verdict?
I'm that sick of waiting, I could stamp on a litter of wildcats...
...and never feel a scratch.
Well, what are you looking at?
It ain't Tahiti. It's only Portsmouth.
I thought she might row by in a boat.
Who, the queen?
No, my wife.
Sorry, lad.
Why can't I see her?
My wife, my boy...
...that's all I've come back for.
I knew they'd hang me.
But I've got to see them.
I've got to see them!
Blast these sea captains!
Who made their sea law?
God didn't. The burning killers!
Lad! We're all in the same boat, Tom.
They won't let me see my mother.
Won't you help us now by holding on?
Yes, sir.
Roger Byam?
Follow me, please.
- Sir Joseph.
- My lad, they've reached a verdict.
- Watch the dirk.
- The dirk?
The midshipman's dirk will be lying on the table before Lord Hood.
If it lies crosswise, you've been acquitted.
If the point lies toward you, you've been condemned.
God be with you.
Thank you, sir.
MAN: Prisoner and escort, halt.
Left, hut.
HOOD: Have you anything to say before the sentence of this court...
...is passed upon you?
Milord, much as I desire to live,
I'm not afraid to die.
Since I first sailed on the Bounty four years ago...
...l've known how men can be made to suffer worse things than death.
Cruelly, beyond duty, beyond necessity.
Captain Bligh, you've told your story of mutiny on the Bounty.
How men plotted against you, seized your ship...
...cast you adrift in an open boat.
A great venture in science brought to nothing. Two British ships lost.
But there's another story,
Captain Bligh...
...of 10 coconuts and two cheeses.
A story of a man who robbed his seamen, cursed them, flogged them.
Not to punish, but to break their spirit.
A story of greed and tyranny...
...and of anger against it, of what it cost.
One man, milord, would not endure such tyranny.
That's why you hounded him. That's why you hate him, hate his friends.
And that's why you're beaten.
Fletcher Christian's still free.
But Christian lost too, milord.
God knows he's judged himself more harshly than you could judge him.
I say to his father, he was my friend.
No finer man ever lived.
I don't try to justify his crime, his mutiny...
...but I condemn the tyranny that drove him to it.
I don't speak here for myself alone, but for these men you've condemned.
I speak in their names and Fletcher
Christian's name for all men at sea.
These men don't ask for comfort.
They don't ask for safety.
If they could speak to you, they'd say:
"Let us choose to do our duty willingly.
Not the choice of a slave, but that of free Englishmen."
They ask only the freedom that England expects for every man.
If one man among you believed that--
One man.
He could command the fleets of England.
He could sweep the seas for England.
If he called his men to their duty not by flaying their backs...
...but by lifting their hearts...
...their....
That's all.
Roger Byam, midshipman.
Having heard the evidence against you and having heard your own defense...
...the sentence of this court is you shall suffer death by hanging...
...onboard such of His Majesty's ships of war and at such time...
...as the commissioners for executing the office of lord high admiral...
...of Great Britain and Ireland shall direct.
MAN:
Prisoner and escort, into file.
Left, turn. Quick, hut.
I pronounce this court dissolved.
Milord, may I congratulate the court?
Captain Bligh, in my opinion, your open-boat voyage...
...was the most remarkable conduct of navigation in the history of the sea.
I must admire your seamanship and courage, but....
Detachment, fall in.
[LOCK TURNING]
Thanks, mate.
I've seen them, sir, thanks to you and your friends.
The wife, she's well, sir.
And the boy, blow me,
I hardly knew him, he's growed so.
You wouldn't believe it, the dead spit of me.
I'm glad, Tom.
Look, sir. Like the one she gave me the day we sailed for Tahiti.
Do you know, sir, that sailing seems like a dream.
As far away as the islands are.
I remember how Mr. Christian talked to me that day.
Cheered me up, he did.
Where do you think he is now, sir?
I'd give anything to know.
One thing's certain, he's taken that ship beyond maps.
I wonder if he found his island.
MAN: Well, sir, what did you find?
- Your new home, lads.
There she is, Pitcairn's Island.
THOMPSON:
There's no place to land.
That's why I chose it. I plan to run the Bounty in head-on, then burn her.
- Burn her?
- We'd be fools to burn her.
We'll be fools if we don't.
If there's one spar left in sight, we'll never be safe.
MAN: Sir, we can't burn the ship.
- We can never get back.
There's no way back, lad.
Once ashore, we're there to stay.
But this ship's our last tie with home.
Yon's a lonely rock to die on.
It's enough to live on.
There's sun and earth and water.
It can be a hell or a home as we choose to make it.
We'll remember this as long as we live and regret it.
And remember why we took this ship.
They can't press-gang you there, they can't starve you, and can't flog you.
We're not afraid of a new life.
As long as we can live it with decency and self-respect, we can and we must.
For ourselves and our children.
Well, hands for burning?
- I say burn her, hull and sticks.
ALL: Aye, aye.
Very well. We'll get the women and children ashore...
...and then stand by to take her in.
ALL: Aye, sir.
She makes a grand light, sir.
Good English oak.
Discipline has been maintained.
The mutineers who confessed have been punished.
But we're here to plead for the life of Roger Byam...
...because we believe him innocent.
And there is more at stake here,
Your Majesty, than his life.
We do not exaggerate when we say a new understanding...
...between officers and men has come to the fleet.
By returning Byam to duty, Your Majesty will confirm that understanding.
And not for today only, but for all time to come.
[SINGING]
Everyone aboard?
- The last shore boat's coming alongside.
- Make ready for sea.
Very good, sir.
- Ship ready for sea, sir.
- Very good.
Midshipman Byam, reporting for duty.
- You take the mizzenmast, Byam.
- Very good.
- Very glad to have you with us, lad.
- Thank you, sir.
- May I, Byam?
- Of course.
We're off to the Mediterranean, lad.
We'll sweep the seas for England.
Sir?
[ENGLISH - US - SDH]
Hurry, you don't want to miss the king, do you?
- You know, the king won't wait for you.
- Come along.
The king, king Ferdinand, he's coming.
What's the matter with you frenchies?
Why don't you salute the new king?
- We only salute our emperor, Napoleon.
- No Colas, come on.
♪ Alleluia, Alleluia ♪
♪ Glory, glory, god will have the strength forever. ♪
Your majesty, general Savary has arrived with messages from the emperor Napoleon.
- He hopes for an audience.
- We will receive him.
Let us hope he brings news that the French troops are leaving.
I never approved of allowing them to use our country as a... battlefield in their quarrels with the British.
His excellency general Savary, the Duke of Rovigo.
You are welcome general.
Your majesty, I've arrived just in time to add my voice to the multitude.
I, I hope that you come with good news from the emperor.
Good news and bad.
It seems that their majesties, your illustrious father and mother... feel that their abdication was somewhat forced.
Forced? Why...
Why, my father was only too happy to allow the burden to drop from his shoulders.
They have appealed to my sovereign, the emperor Napoleon.
As you know, all that my sovereign the emperor desires is peace in Europe.
The emperor feels that if your majesty would consent to a conference... it might be settled amicably.
I, I shall be most honored to receive his majesty.
Unfortunately, at the present moment the emperor cannot come to Madrid.
But if your majesty would meet him halfway say, in Bayonne...
Yes. Yes, of course.
You may tell his majesty that I shall come, I shall be most pleased to come.
I shall report immediately to his majesty the emperor.
- Your majesty, if I may presume...
- The people await your majesty's appearance.
Yes, yes of course.
They shall have food and wine for their week of festivities.
His majesty has graciously decreed that there shall be a week of festivities... with food and wine for all.
Nina Maria.
- Let me pass Etienne, I have to change.
- You've changed already.
- That's a very bad joke, let me go.
- I shall see you tonight?
- Perhaps.
- Perhaps?
- I haven't time to talk now.
- But Nina Maria...
That Etienne...
Don't know he's going to be so hard get rid of.
It's the flowers señorita.
- He saw them.
- Who sent them?
- The Marquis De Melito.
- The Marquis?
- Oh, he's coming here tonight.
- Señorita?
Now I know I have to get rid of Etienne.
Who is it? Just a minute.
Etienne...
You can't put me off this way, you're coming with me tonight.
Now Etienne, try to understand, I'm tired.
Who is he? Who is he?
I demand to know my successor's name.
Your successor?
Oh, you know no one could take your place.
Why, you're charming, very delightful.
It's just that I'm tired.
You can't deceive me, who sent you those flowers?
Can't a man send me flowers without my going out with him?
If you go out with anyone tonight, I'll kill him.
Etienne, Etienne, try to be sensible.
Go on home, perhaps tomorrow night.
This is going to be settled tonight.
Oh señorita, I'm afraid he mean it.
Oh, if we could only keep the Marquis from coming here.
It would be terrible if anything happens to him.
Nothing will happen to the
Marquis, I promise you that.
If he wants to kill anyone, it will not be the Marquis.
But what can you do señorita?
I just have to make him think it's someone in there.
Come on.

- He has a lovely voice, hasn't he?
- And he sounds so happy.
Oh, don't Lola, I had to do it.
I simply had to protect the Marquis.
The señorita's dressing room is right there.
See who it is.
- Señor.
- Don Diego Manrique de Lara, at your service.
- Come out of that door, quickly.
- With pleasure.
- What happened?
- Didn't you hear me singing to you?
I mean what happened with the French officer?
Oh that, he just glared and walked out.
You haven't a minute to lose.
You must get out of here immediately.
OH, but I just came.
You're a nice young man, you've a lovely voice.
Did you like it?
Yes, but listen, I'm trying to talk sense to you, You don't seem to understand.
You've got to get out of here as quickly as possible.
You don't expect me to leave after you kissed me? I'm yours from now on.
You want to know why I kissed you?
No, it doesn't matter.
You did and I liked it.
I kissed you to get rid of that French officer and that's the only reason.
- Oh, really?
- Yes.
Well, you didn't succeed, he's still there.
Matter of fact, there's 3 of them.
- I think you'd better try it again, eh?
- Please, go out the other way.
- That man is an expert marksman.
- What of it?
But you haven't a chance against him, he thinks you're his successor.
He thinks you're here to try and get me away from him.
Well, that's what you want him to think, isn't it?
Oh, yes.
Well, he certainly won't think so if I go out alone. Come on, let's show him that his right.
All right.
- Good night Lola.
- Good night señorita.
Goodbye señor.
Monsieur...
I am captain Audouy representing captain Dubois.
He feels he is been grossly insulted, he demands satisfaction..
Did he say what would satisfy him?
- Name your weapons, name the place, at dawn.
- Dawn?
Oh, couldn't we make it a little later?
Your seconds can find me at this address.
Well...
Now that we're rid of them, where should we go for supper?
- Where you live?
- Oh, just around the corner.
- I, I mean, where you come from?
- Oh, Valencia.
Well, you go back to
Valencia just as fast as you can.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, I know, I know.
You cannot fight that man, he'd kill you.
Your coach?
Another one?
This is one I don't want to get rid of.
- Home.
- Yes.
- Señorita...
- Please don't fight that duel.
Well, did you find out anything?
- A little.
- Good.
These French officers are so sure of themselves it isn't hard to make them talk.
Difficult thing is getting rid of them afterward.
This last one was the worst of all but he was also the most talkative.
It seems Napoleon is sending 30,000 more troops.
That'll make 100,000
French soldiers in Spain.
What the officers been told?
Why do they think they're here?
It's always the same thing.
They're here to protect us in case the English invade the continent.
- No talk of war with us?
- No, no, only with the English.
I'm sorry. That's all they seem to know.
I'm convinced that's all any of them know in Madrid.
Nina Maria,
I'm going to send you on an important mission, the most important one you ever taken.
I've arranged for a professional appearance for you at Bayonne... where the conference between
Ferdinand and Napoleon is to be held.
You mean Ferdinand is planning on leaving the country at a time like this?
He and his counselors believe that this conference is a friendly one.
That Napoleon's only interest is the welfare of Spain.
Needless to say, I don't agree.
Napoleon wants to get control of Europe.
The only thing stands in his way is Ferdinand and his popularity.
If he can get rid of Ferdinand... he can take Spain.
Of course these are only my suspicions, I have no proof.
Well, what about Paris?
What word you hear from them?
Well, 2 of our best agents there have just been thrown in prison.
French are very efficient counterspies.
That's why I'm sending you.
I want you to mingle with the French officers at Bayonne.
Those closest to Napoleon and find out what Napoleon is really planning to do.
- When you want me to start?
- Tomorrow morning.
Then if we find this conference is merely a trap as I fear it is... we'll be able to stop Ferdinand before he crosses into France.
- And I'll do the best I can.
- I know you will.
You will stop at the inn of the golden fleece in Vitoria.
Just this side of the border.
One of our agents there will give you any further news.
- Very well.
- Are you sure you can leave tomorrow?
Well, I'll have to make some excuse at the cafe if that's what you mean.
I mean is there no one to hold you here?
- No man?
- Oh, that. No.
Nina Maria, to a man in my position you're a gift from heaven.
Never any moods, hysterics, never any entanglements.
I can't imagine any man as exciting as this service to my country.
Dri, driver,
- You think we'll reach Vitoria by tonight?
- We'll try, señorita.
Thanks.
Pedro, should I go and help the mules with my whistle?
Yes.
- Now what?
- Bandits.
Bandits?
- But I only see one.
- He's a lookout for the rest.
- Oh drive on, hurry, hurry.
- Come on Carlito.
Wait, don't shoot, don't shoot.
Is this the coach of señorita Azara?
- You?
- Ah, greetings.
Now, would you mind telling him to point that the other way?
Serve you right if you did get shot.
Scaring people to death like that.
It's all right Pedro, put it down.
- Sí señorita.
- We thought you were a bandit.
- Oh, no wonder you gave me such a chase.
- What are you doing here anyway?
Well, I came to tell you not to worry about me.
You see, I didn't fight that duel after all.
As a matter of fact, I overslept.
- You come all this way just to tell me that?
- I had to.
When went to cafe last night, you'd already left and I knew you'd be anxious about me.
Oh, that was very kind of you.
Very, very thoughtful. Thank you very much.
- All right Pedro.
- Wait a minute.
You're not going to run away from me again?
I have to, I've a very important engagement in Bayonne, very important.
- Have you any idea how beautiful you are?
- Yes, drive on Pedro, drive on.
All right Pedro... and don't worry about any bandits,
I'll be riding right here by your side.
Well, thank you very much but
I don't want to trouble you.
Trouble me? You can't help it.
You've troubled me from the first time I set eyes on you.
I picked him to get rid of that French officer, now how am I going to get rid of him?
- You don't mind my riding here, do you?
- The road is free, you can do as you like.
I might be able to entertain you on your trip.
Oh no, thank you. Was just going to sleep.
- Splendid, I'll sing you to sleep.
- We'll play for you.
How about a lullaby? Can you play that?
No, no, if you must sing, make it something with spirit.
- Something gay, something lively.
- I thought you wanted to sleep.
Oh, I can sleep through anything.
I was just thinking of the mules.

♪ Doesn't seem to care for the song in the air ♪

- Buenos días señor.
- Buenos días.
This way.
Señorita.
Thank you so much for making the trip seem shorter.
Oh, it was far too short for me.
Now, won't you be kind and have dinner with me tonight?
Sorry I can't, goodbye.
You know, you're a very beautiful girl, charming, alluring but you have one bad habit.
- Yes, what?
- Why, you're always saying goodbye.
Very well then,
I won't say goodbye, I'll just go.
This way señorita.
Pablo, Pablo, hurry with the baggage.
This señorita is the other room.
Now, is there anything else the señorita desires?
Oh yes, I'd like a tub with plenty of hot water please.
Sí. Right away. Pelela, Cristina.
Quick, the lady desires a bath.
- The tub, right away señorita.
- Thank you.
- Señorita...
- Oh, just a moment.
- I have a message for you.
- What is it?
The king has started, he left Madrid this morning.
This morning?
But it's been arranged for him to stop here in Vitoria.
If you get any word, you are to send it here.
We can keep him then from going any farther.
- Well, how will I get word to you?
- Go to the marketplace in Bayonne.
There will be a man selling chickens and livestock.
He will have carrier pigeons there for you, he will know you if you say, Vitoria.
Vitoria?
Hurry, hurry, you've always got the time to sleep. Come, here. Put the tub right there.
There. Here. Right here.
All right, go get more water.
Come, more water.
Ah, Pablo?
- Yes, señorita?
- Did you bring up everything, that was all?
That was all señorita.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.
Pablo, the señor wishes a bath too, get him a tub.
And what would the señorita like for dinner?
Oh dinner, yes. Yes, I think I'd like some fish, some salad, Valencia stew... in about a half an hour...
Leave it to me, I will have a perfect dinner for you.
- Thank you. Oh, just a minute.
- Yes, señorita?
One thing more, the most important of all.
I want a quiet, secluded table in a corner.
- Alone.
- I understand, alone.
- The poor señor, he will be so disappointed.
- I can't help it. I don't dare encourage him.
He might follow us to Bayonne.
Look how far he's already come on a kiss.
- Señor?
- Yes, come in.
And what would the señor like for dinner?
Well, you'd better ask señorita what she would like.
Oh, the señorita's already ordered.
Well, whatever she wants is all right with me.
- Is the señorita with you?
- Well, yes and no.
You know what I mean.
But the señorita said she wishes to be alone.
- Alone? Alone?
- Yes, alone.
Oh yes, of course, alone. You know, alone.
- That's right.
- Oh alone, yes.
Oh, hello.
Well, just in time.
- I'm afraid there's some mistake.
- Oh no, everything is ready.
- But I ordered a table alone.
- Well, we are alone.
There isn't another soul except...
Well, those, those troubadours there.
Shall I send them away?
That's better. Oh, excuse me.
Señorita...
- That's not what I ordered.
- Oh no, I took the liberty of adding this.
- Pablo.
- What is it?
Flaming egg omelet, my own recipe.
- But I don't see any flame.
- Oh, wait.
- Frederico, Lee, Leon.
- Sí, hombre.
This is the supreme moment.
Ready?
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Taste? Oh, oh, oh, it's very hot.
What does it taste like?
- More.
- More, good.
- Want anything more?
- No, thank you.
- More food?
- No.
Wine? Isn't there anything?
No, nothing, thank you.
- Well.
- Oh, you're not going in now?
- Well, I thought I'd take a little walk.
- Oh splendid, I'll walk with you.
- Was everything satisfactory this evening?
- Yes, thank you, quite good.
Oh, look. Jasmine.
- It's sweet and fragrant.
- It's like the rest of Spain.
- Waits until the night to come to life.
- Lovely night, isn't it?
Flowers, stars, music...
Oh, you poor darling.
How would you like to go through that every time you needed a new pair of shoes?
Well, at least he doesn't have to take them off every night.
- Oh, Pedro.
- Yes señorita?
I'd like to get an early start tomorrow morning.
- Yes, señorita.
- About 5 o'clock then?
Yes, señorita.
- All right, good night.
- Good night señorita.
Good night darling, you better try and get some sleep now.
Are you coming with us señor?
No. No, you'll have to be our protector from now on.
Señor is far too important, far too busy a man... to be wasting his time following us around the country.
I didn't say a word.
Now you listen to me... you're a very charming, very amusing young man but you are not going with me to Bayonne.
You mean, you could send me home, put me out of your life so easily?
I'm afraid I could.
Oh, now, wait, wait.
It's much too lovely a night to go to sleep.
- Let's sit out here and talk for a while.
- Sit?
Oh yes. Here, it's lovely.
Come on, right here. There you are.
- Comfortable?
- Yes/.
Now, wait a minute, I'll give you a nice, soft cushion.
- Here, you lean against that, how's that?
- Oh, that's wonderful.
Tell me, what do you do when you're not following young women around the country?
Oh, I don't follow young women around the country.
- No?
- No, just you.
Oh, well, I mean aside from that.
Well, my family left me a little money so I travel around and amuse myself.
That satisfy you?
Is that all you want of life?
It was.
Till I met you.
Well, now you're not going to try to get romantic here?
Why not?
What's wrong with this place? Why, it's one of the most romantic spots in the world.
Listen to that song.
- What is it?
- It's Italian song, don't you know it?
No, lovely though.
What more could you want?
This place is full of romance.
Why, it's, it's like Venice.
- Venice?
- It is Venice.
Look at that moon, where could you find a moon like that?
And look up there, you see the dome of St. Mark's?
The one with the pigeons?
- No, I don't see a thing.
- Of course not, you got your eyes open.
Close them.
Now you see it?
No, I don't see the dome but
I just heard one of the pigeons.,
Gondolier, take us to the grand canal.
Now we're pushing off.
Do you hear the lapping of the water against the sides of the gondola?
- Do you feel the motion of the boat?
- Yes.
Do you, feel the sea breeze?
- Now where are we?
- Right back in the barnyard.
Oh no, we're in Venice.

- Now don't you believe in Venice?
Now don't you believe this is the most romantic spot in the world?
- Very nice.
- Nice? Nice? Is that all you can say?
Why, you should be overwhelmed.
You should be swooning in my arms.
- Yes, but I don't feel swoony.
- Well, perhaps I better sing it again.
Oh, no, no. No please.
You see, you see, I'm not the only one, think we'd better get out of here.
- You awakened the whole place.
- Now, wait, wait.
You can't tell me you weren't a little moved by my song.
- I saw it in your eyes.
- Well, yes I was.
- I knew it.
- Just once.
You know that part where you sang...

You know that place just before the high note?
- Yes?
- Well, I was wondering.
- Yes?
- I guess I better not tell you.
- Oh no, come on, come on please.
- Well, I was wondering.
- Yes?
- I wonder if you were going to make it.
Oh wait, you're the most discouraging person.
Goodbye.
Oh, but you're not going to leave me here stranded in Vitoria?
But I have to.
Honestly, when am I going to see you again?
Honestly, you go back to Madrid... and when I return from Bayonne maybe I won't be so discouraging.

- Well Lola, how's that for a start?
- Señorita...
That Don Diego, I thought he was going to spoil everything.
Don't worry about him.
He'll not trouble me after tonight, I saw to that.
Well, she certainly trained her guns on you colonel.
Oh, nonsense.
- Well, I must be going.
- Going? So soon?
Nothing but work for an adjutant.
But, colonel... your hat.
- Oh yes?
- Shall I get it for you sir?
No no. No, I'll pick it up myself.
Good night gentlemen.
Oh major... why don't you stay a while and enjoy yourself?
- Thank you colonel.
- Gentlemen.
Good night sir.
New hat, new uniform.
Hasn't been a colonel very long Lola.
- When he arrives you slip out quietly.
- Sí señorita.
Colonel de Rougemont's compliments to the señorita.
- And may I...
- Oh, come in.
Señorita.
Forgive me for having run off with your hat, was stupid of me.
- Not at all.
- You're not angry?
I'm honored.
Then I'm going to tell you the truth, won't you sit down?
I took it deliberately, I wanted to see you.
Well.
I was so terrified tonight. You know, this is the first time I've ever played in France.
And you were so gracious. You helped me through an ordeal and I wanted to thank you.
No one could've guessed you were nervous señorita, you were delightful.
Oh, do you think so? It's so hard to tell, everything is so different here.
Tell me, were those the right songs?
Is it the sort of entertainment they enjoy in Bayonne?
I know I enjoyed it, I can't answer for the rest of Bayonne, I've just come here myself.
- From Paris?
- No, unfortunately just Bordeaux.
Bordeaux? Oh, but that's just as exciting.
Isn't that where the emperor Napoleon is?
- Yes.
- Oh, did you see him?
Well, as a matter of fact, I've just been made one of his aides.
May I touch you?
Oh, I can't tell you what this means to me., if you only knew how I felt about Napoleon.
I hope you can learn to feel just as warmly about one of his aides.
- So sorry, will you excuse me?
- Of course.
How lovely.
- And this note, señorita.
- Thank you.
The gentleman told me it was urgent, I should wait for an answer.
- Well, would you excuse me?
- Of course.
Thank you.
Tell the gentleman I decline his kind offer.
Just someone wanting me to have supper with him.
I should ask you to have supper with me but unfortunately, I have urgent business that...
Oh, that doesn't mean you have to go to Bordeaux?
Oh no, I shall be here for some time.
At least until after the conference.
- Conference?
- With your own king Ferdinand.
He's on his way here from Madrid.
- Oh, is he?
- Yes.
But a conference, that sounds so serious.
I hope that doesn't mean trouble.
Is just awful if anything like that happened after I'd made my debut in France.
Why, they might even send me back home.
We can't allow anything like that to occur.
As a matter of fact we hope it'll bring about a closer alliance between the 2 countries.
I can think of nothing more pleasant than a close alliance between France and Spain.
I agree, In fact I think we should set an example ourselves.
Do you think that would help international relationships?
- Tremendously.
- Then I suppose we should consider our duty.
- Well, shall we start with dinner sometime?
- When?
Shall we say...
- Ah, what were you saying?
- How about...
This is dreadful, please forgive me.
- The gentleman said...
- The same gentleman?
- Yes.
- Tell him I gave him his answer, no.
No more flowers and no more messages.
- That's a very persistent young man.
- Yes, isn't he?
- Will you dine with me tomorrow at 1?
- I'd love it.
They say there's a delightful cafe.
Wouldn't be more pleasant dining tete-à-tete?
Say, at your quarters?
I was going to suggest that later, may I call for you?
I think it'd be a little more discreet if I came by myself.
I'm at the Chateau Neuf, Rue Dasinalle.
Goodbye señorita.
- Goodbye.
- Until tomorrow.
Tomorrow.
- Oh, colonel.
- Yes?
Your hat.
Thank you.
Señorita.
Oh, I couldn't help it Gianina Mia,
I didn't know I was jealous until...
Apples, fresh red apples, apples.
Apples.
Yes mademoiselle, can I help you?
Pigeons, ducks, some delicious rabbits.
Rabbits? Are they nice?
- Well, these pigeons are they fresh?
- Oh fine, lovely bird mademoiselle.
They told me at Vitoria you had good birds here.
- Vitoria?
- Yes, Vitoria.
Have you been in Spain recently mademoiselle?
Yes, I stopped at the inn of the Golden Fleece just 2 nights ago.
This is a particularly fine bird.
Plump, tender, look.
- The king will reach Vitoria tonight.
- Tonight?
They have persuaded him to stay there until he gets some... further assurance of good will from Napoleon... but when he gets it, he is determined to continue on his way.
I hope to have some word of my own that will stop him before that happens.
Let us pray that you will señorita.
Will one be enough señorita?
Oh, perhaps you'd better let me have two just in case of something unexpected.
I'll let you pick them out, you know which one is the best.
- Well, why not take these two?
- All right.
These are excellent birds and
I assure you they'll go right to the spot.
Well, good day señor.
Lola, have we go everything?
We have about a half hour left.
- Let me try another one.
- Here's one, here.
Lola, take a carriage and go home with those things, I want to get some air.
Sí señorita.
Oh I, I, I beg your pardon.
I was just trying on some hats.
Very becoming.
- I thought you weren't speaking to me.
- I wasn't.
Oh, forgive me.
- The man will be back in a moment.
- I wasn't, but...
- I am now.
- You mean you've forgiven me?
- What did it?
- That hat.
- Does monsieur desire the hat?
- Keep it for me.
I want to have it framed.
Flowers madam? Flowers for the lady monsieur?
- May I buy you some flowers?
- Oh, I think you might.
Anything but, roses.
- Violets, primroses, Jasmine.
- Jasmine would be nice.
- Jasmine please.
- Oui.
- Merci.
- Thank you.
Oh, what you doing here?
I had some shopping to do and thought
I'd take a walk around, see the town.
Come on, let me show you the sights.
- Are there any?
- Are there any?
Why, on my right is one of the most famous buildings in Bayonne.
- So?
- You see that balcony up there?
- Yes.
- And that open window?
Well, in that very room is where
Don Diego spent that night of torture... when he thought his
Gianina had thrown him down.
- Funny, I don't see any tablet.
- Oh, they knew he wouldn't like that.
- You see, he was a very modest man.
- Are you sure is Don Diego?
Oh yes. Why, they even have the bed he tossed in, the chairs he broke in his anguish.
Why, there are even some of his remains there.
- Remains?
- The hair he pulled out.
Strawberries, strawberries.
- Nice fresh strawberries for mademoiselle?
- Oh, aren't they luscious?
You like some? There you are.
Oh, just a minute. I'll get you your change.
All right.
- They're good.
- Aren't they?
- Chestnuts monsieur?
- Chestnuts?
- Want some?
- About a half-dozen.
- I'll tell you what we'll do.
- What?
We'll get a bottle of wine and some cheese and we'll go down to the river and have lunch, eh?
I'd love it but I can't.
I have an engagement.
- With the colonel?
- Yes.
- I thought so.
- Oh no, don't act like that.
After all, I'm in France and my audience is made up of French officers...
I have to be nice to them.
- Your chestnuts monsieur.
- Thank you.
I don't like to see a good Spaniard making a fuss over the French.
I, I didn't realize you were such a good patriot.
I didn't realize it myself until now.
Colonel de Rougemont is a very important man, can do a lot for me.
Colonel de Rougemont never did anything for anyone without them paying for it.
- Oh, I found out all about him.
- Monsieur, monsieur.
- Your change monsieur.
- Thank you, here you are.
Oh, thank you monsieur.
Well, at least you don't have to go off this minute.
- No.
- Let's see the rest of the town.
Oh, we can't walk along the streets like this eating things.
Why not? People who know you will think it's charming.
- How about the people who don't know me?
- They'll wish they did.
There you are, not a chestnut left.
- Have you any more?
- I got just one.
Oh, but it's not for you.
- Come on, sit down.
- All right.
Don't pay any attention to them, they'll go away.
- Lovely, isn't it?
- But it's not Spain.
No, no, it's not Spain.
- What's that?
- Oh, that.
Well, that's an old medallion my father gave my mother the day they were married.
I remember when I was a little girl begging my mother to let me play with it but... she never take it off.
- Look, my mother and father.
- They're lovely.
- All I have left.
- What happened?
Our hacienda was in direct line of attack when the French invaded Spain 20 years ago.
I should think that would make you feel very bitterly toward the French.
Oh no, no, that was a long time ago.
Look.
Well, is that any way to talk to a lady? Go on, go on.
He wants another chestnut, give him one.
Oh no, I got one more left, he's not going to get it, is for you. Here.
Go on, eat it before he sees you.
Oh, it's no use, you don't fool him. Here, come on.
There.
That's all, now go on, run away.
I haven't any more, see? All gone.
No, that was my last one, honest, honest it was.
Oh no, got one more. Here.
- Oh, look, look, it's gone.
- Oh, you?
You're laughing, haven't you any heart?
- Does it hurt?
- Of course it hurts.
Look, he's probably eating the end of my finger right now.
Oh look, it even scratched.
- There isn't much feeling there.
- All right.
- That better?
- A little. Oh, but it isn't well yet.
I like it. Oh, I mean the song.
Go on, sing it, makes me forget the pain.

- Vive I'empereur.
- Vive I'empereur.
- Napoleon?
- I must go.
- Go?
- Oh yes, my engagement is getting late.
- Nina Maria, don't go to that man.
- But I must, you don't understand.
- If I ask you not to?
- Please I, I can't explain.
- This isn't just jealousy.
Nina Maria, I'm not thinking of myself.
Don't go please, I beg of you.
Nothing will come between us, I promise you.
Here. Take this, as a sign of my love...
And with it, my whole heart.
Try to understand and believe in me, please.
- Are my things laid out?
- Sí, señorita, but...
But what?
- I'm afraid something terrible is happened.
- What is it?
A soldier brought this letter a few moments ago, from colonel de Rougemont.
Colonel de Rougemont?
Beg your forgiveness, but due to unexpected developments... must postpone our delightful tete-à-tete...
4 or 5 days.
I know.
It's Ferdinand's refusal to come any further that's caused all this.
4 or 5 days.
- Do you suppose...
- What señorita?
That'd be just time enough... for de Rougemont to reach Vitoria with Napoleon's message and get back.
Oh señorita, if you could only see that message.
I don't have to see it, I know what will be in it, a lot of empty promises.
Anything to get our king into France.
What I want to know is...
What are Napoleon's orders in case
Ferdinand doesn't believe that message.
In case he refuses to come?
Lola, I'm going to keep that engagement.
Oh, señorita...
And if de Rougemont doesn't expect me so much the better.
- Colonel de Rougemont?
- Yes but...
Tell him señorita Azara is arrived.
But, señorita, the colonel is not here.
Not here? Oh, that's curious.
- You're expecting him?
- Yes señorita, he said he be back.
Yes, well then, I'll just wait, thank you.
But señorita I...
If I had known the señorita was coming
I should've had the place more orderly.
- Oh, it's quite all right, don't bother.
- Is there anything you would like?
- No.
- A little wine?
No, nothing, thank you, thank you.
Duval, Duval...
- What's the matter with you Duval?
- Yes sir?
Get my equipment together.
I will start as soon as...
You, señorita?
You seem surprised, had you forgotten?
Oh no, but I sent you a note, to your hotel.
Oh? Well, I was out shopping.
What was it? What did it say?
I had to ask you to postpone our engagement.
- Postpone it?
- Can you forgive me?
Something unexpected is happened... the emperor ordered me to go to
Vitoria to take a message to your king.
I must escort him into France.
Well, I suppose since it's my own king, I'll, I'll have to forgive you.
Oh, it's sweet of you to understand but it's only a postponement.
I'll be back in 4 or 5 days at the most and then perhaps, we can continue...
- Unless something else unexpected happens?
- Nothing else unexpected can happen.
I promise you that.
Duval. My orderly will take you back to your hotel.
- Oh, you're not leaving this minute?
- I'm waiting for some dispatches.
I must be ready to start when they come.
Then I'll...
I'll just wait here and say goodbye to you.
- At your order sir.
- Ready?
Yes, sir.
- Duval, you might open that door a little.
- Yes sir.

- Did you like it?
I like everything about you.
Your voice, your hair, your lips.
Perhaps I'd better go.
If you only knew how I'd looked forward to having you here alone.
- Yes, it would've been nice, wouldn't it?
- It will be nice.
- Yes, but sometimes when the mood is broken.
- Oh Nina Maria, don't say that.
You're making it very difficult for me to go.
- Dispatches colonel.
- Any orders sir?
- Has the escort arrived?
- Be here presently sir.
Thank you captain.
- I suppose that means you must go now.
- Yes.
- I'm sorry.
- Well...
Wouldn't it be,
Oh here, let me help you with that.
Thanks.
These, I should hate them.
- They're really coming between us.
- Nothing can come between us Nina Maria.
Promise me that you'll meet me here when I return.
I promise.
Nina Maria.
- I must go.
- Yes, of course.
Can you forgive me if I let
Duval take you back to your hotel?
Certainly, I understand.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Did you see him señorita?
- Yeah, get the code, quickly.
Oh señorita.
Squeeze that lemon.
Marquis was right, Lola.
- This conference is a trap.
- What?
Colonel is carrying 2 messages.
One is probably a letter of reassurance, the other an order for arrest.
Arrest?
They haven't any mean to lure the king into
France with their promises of goodwill... and they'll take him prisoner as he crosses the border, get me the pack of the birds.
- Is the colonel started señorita?
- Yes.
But he won't get there before late tomorrow night.
Our message should be there in 4 hours at most.
Time to warn the king so he can turn back.
Now the pigeons.
What is it? What's wrong?
This is not my bird, the markings are different.
- Señorita?
- Someone changed it.
But they couldn't I, how could they?
I've been here all the time.
Except...
- You did go out?
- Yes.
The concierge asked me to look in another room where he thought you'd be more comfortable.
That's when they did it.
Let me see the other one.
Concierge?
But it couldn't be he.
No, you see? You see, they changed them both.
They substituted their birds for mine so that my message would go to them.
But who do you suppose could've done this?
Someone who knew my every move.
Someone who knew I had the birds... who knew when I went out and bribed the concierge to get you out of the room.
But if they knew all that why haven't they done something before?
They had to get evidence before they could take me.
If I'd sent this message, they would had it.
Can't you do anything?
Can't you get word to the king?
I don't know.
I might try the man in the market but...
- still, if they knew about the birds they...
- How about Don Diego?
- I'm thinking about him.
- He'd do anything for you.
He knows the roads, he rides fast.
If he leaves now, he could reach Vitoria before the colonel, he could warn the king.
What is it?
He might be the very one who's doing all this.
- Señorita?
- Oh, I know, I know.
But who else could it be?
Marquis said the French had...
- very efficient counterspies.
- But Don Diego? It couldn't be he.
Oh, I hope and pray you're right Lola.
Here, clear up all this.
Destroy everything, get rid of the birds.
- Don't leave a trace of evidence.
- Where are you going?
I'm going to the marketplace.
And if that fails, I'll go to Don Diego.
Pardon me.
The man who owns that store, where is he?
The police came and took him away madame, just a few minutes ago.
The police?
Yes madam, I don't know why but they just came and took him away.
- That's too bad, eh?
- I'd find another store, thank you.
She's coming up here, put those reports away.
Go in there.
Yes, sir.
She's probably coming to you for help.
Just remember, she'll be suspicious.
She's discovered those birds have been changed.
So, be doubly careful.
Make her believe that you're ready and eager to help her, get her to talk.
If she'll confide in you, confess what's she's doing that's all we need.
Very well sir.
And put a better face on it.
You've been long enough in the service to know there's no room for sentiment.
I'll be in there.
- Nina Maria.
- I've, I've come to see this historic site.
- Come in.
- Are you alone?
Yes, yes. Come in, come in.
- What happened to the colonel?
- He had to go to Vitoria on duty.
- Oh, then you didn't have lunch with him.
- No.
Oh, you must be starved, let me get you something, some fruit, wine?
A little wine please, I'm really not hungry.
- Sure?
- Yes, thank you.
How charming?
I didn't know you could find a place like this on such short notice.
- Oh yes, wasn't I lucky?
- Yes.
I wasn't sure I'd find you here,
I was afraid you might be out.
Oh, I came right back here after you left me at the riverbank.
You've, you've deceived me Diego.
- Deceived you?
- Yes.
Yes, you told me I'd find all the chairs broken from that night of anguish.
Oh, yeah.
But everything was miraculously healed today.
- To us.
- To us.
- Getting late.
- Oh, nonsense.
Why, it's only 3 o'clock.
We've several hours before you have to go back to the cafe.
Yes.
- Diego.
- Yes?
You, you meant what you said to me today on the riverbank, didn't you?
Oh, you know I did, Nina Maria.
I'm going to ask you to do something for me.
How long did it take you to get here from Vitoria?
Oh, a day and a half.
Of course, I was riding very hard.
- Why?
- I want you to take a message for me.
- A message?
- Yes/
I'll, I'll write it for you.
Oh, I'll get you some paper.
- Pen?
- Thank you.
Will you get your things?
I'd like you to leave immediately.
- Where am I to go?
- To Vitoria.
- Vitoria?
- Yes.
Here.
- You haven't told me whom this is for.
- Read it and see.
I'll take that captain Andre.
- Captain Andre?
- Of the French military intelligence service.
- French?
- Yes Nina Maria, I'm French.
It took us a long time to find out... who was getting information from our officers in Madrid.
It was captain Andre who first suspected you.
You're a very clever woman señorita but not clever enough.
We've caught you.
- But I, I don't know what you mean.
- Yeah?
Reserve one table alone.
Order one flaming omelet.
I'll be at your place in 3 days.
What's this?
I happen to like flaming omelets.
You mind?
I'm sorry you were disappointed in my note.
As a matter of fact I was about to write another, a much more personal one.
But I wanted first to see what would happen when I handed him this.
Just a moment señorita.
We know very well what that personal message would've been.
We know you're a spy.
Why, monsieur...
Don't think because you outwitted us this time that you can go on with your activities.
You go right back to your hotel and pack.
I'm giving you until 9 o'clock tonight to get out of this country.
And I warn you, don't ever set foot in France again.
Your warning is entirely unnecessary monsieur.
After what I have experienced today I've no desire to return.
Goodbye, better luck next time.
Have you come to see that I leave the country?
- I came to bring you this.
- Thank you.
I know you hate me for what I've done.
You're wrong, I've the greatest admiration for you.
You're a very valuable agent especially for following women.
You sing love songs beautifully and...
Your lovemaking is very convincing.
I deserve everything you think of me but I must tell you, at first, I thought of this as any other assignment.
I even thought it'd be fun.
- Well, wasn't it?
- Yes, it was, for a while.
And then I fell in love...
I wanted to tell you what I was to warn you but I was under orders.
You must believe me Nina Maria,
I do love you and I always will..
I'm afraid I can't believe anything you've ever said.
You're French, that's all I need to know.
Drive on Pedro.
The emperor Napoleon of France makes known to the people of Spain... that Ferdinand VII has abdicated.
- King Ferdinand abdicated?
- What's happening?
In his place,
Joseph Bonaparte will rule as king of Spain.
King Joseph Bonaparte will enter the city of Madrid... on the 20th day of July.
His majesty is to be received with royal honors.
You are to hang tapestries from your balcony.
You're to strew flowers on the street before the king.
You're to be on the streets to welcome the king.
Every man, woman, and child.
You mustn't feel that way.
Perhaps our people needed something like this to stir them out of their lethargy.
There is war and rebellion Nina Maria.
You'll be needed more than ever.
You mean, you still have faith in me after this, this failure?
Oh yes, of course.
You'll have to drop out of sight for a while.
They know you now, it would be too dangerous.
But don't worry, you'll get your chance when the time comes.
I shall live for that time to come.
Are we going to let them take our country from us?
Are we going to let them kill our women and children?
No. No. No.
The British, the British.
Powerful England, powerful England.
This gentlemen, will be the decisive battle of the whole 5 years campaign.
You see the positions of the
French forces holding Vitoria.
The enemy's artillery, here, here, here.
They have command of every bridge, every road, every mountain pass.
And for the first time, we're facing their consolidated forces.
- That means more than 80,000 men.
- Theirs against our 50,000.
With food rations for only half that number, situation seems desperate mi lord.
No no, we've pushed the invaders back this far.
We will not stop now, not if it costs the life of every Spaniard...
That is exactly what it would cost.
And even that wouldn't give us victory.
We must rely on strategy.
May we ask...
For the time being it's best to keep it secret.
But hold all your troops in readiness for an order to attack.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Captain, ask the Marquis de Melito to come here.
Yes mi lord.
- You sent for me mi lord?
- Yes, any word yet?
Only that she's behind the
French lines as a camp follower.
- She's been there a week.
- A week?
These things take time sir.
- She must reestablish certain connections.
- Yes, yes, of course.
I have the utmost faith in her, she's waited a long time for this opportunity.
I know she will not fail.
Continue.
- Bring that girl to headquarters.
- Yes general.
Thank you, what can I sell you all?
- Some wine, tobacco, sweets or wine?
- Let's have wine.
- Yes, give us wine.
- Let's have wine.
Hey, you there.
- Me?
- Yes, you.
- The general wants to see you.
- Oh, what's wrong? I, I've permission.
- Come on, and don't be long about it.
- All right, but I've to take my cart.
Sorry.
- Your coat mademoiselle.
- Oh thank you monsieur.
- Come on.
- All right, all right, all right.
Come on Angelino, the general wants to see us.
Goodbye.
- All right.
- All right.
Enter.
Come in.
Thank you captain Pierlot.
Nina Maria.
- I didn't think you'd remember.
- I remember very well.
I remember that you had an engagement with me at Bayonne 5 years ago.
- And when I came back you had vanished.
- Yes.
Just after you left I had some very bad news.
- I had to leave in a few hours' notice.
- But you might have left me some word.
I was so upset, I was so nervous I...
I didn't take time to do anything, not even to leave you a note, sorry.
And now I find you again, a cantinera following our army.
- Had to make a living some way.
- How long have you been doing this?
Since the war.
Spanish found out I was a French sympathizer and turned against me, so...
Well, everything else may have altered but you haven't changed a particle.
You're more beautiful than ever, if that's possible.
And you're less, how shall I say it? Less... unapproachable.
Was I ever unapproachable with you monsieur?
Oh Nina Maria, why didn't you come to me long ago?
I was afraid, you...
- you were so important.
- Well, you're going to be important again.
You're going back with us to Madrid.
And this time you won't have to worry about pleasing the Spaniards.
You'll have lovely clothes and jewels just as you used to.
No more of this sort of thing.
Duval, Duval.
What's the matter with the fella?
Duval...
- Yes your excellency.
- Now Duval... go down to the major's wife, present my compliments and tell her there's a lady in distress.
Ask her if she'll be kind enough to lend her a... a...
- A complete change of wardrobe.
- Yes sir.
And then bring her some champagne, some of my good champagne.
Yes your excellency.
We must celebrate our finding each other again.
- Years since I've had champagne.
- Ah, you've come just in time.
We've ordered some special wines from Paris to celebrate our victory.
- Is there going to be a battle?
- Not a battle, a rout.
The greatest rout of the war.
Oh, how I should like to see that.
How I should like to see you leading your troops.
- You would, would you?
- Yes.
Take me with you please.
This is not going to be a tournament, you know. Battles aren't a very pleasant sight.
Oh, but I want to see.
You've no idea what it's been like back there behind the lines.
We get our orders, we go here, we go there but we never see anything.
I want to be part of the excitement.
I want to see what's really happening.
Do you think I'm going to risk having something happen to you... just when I've found you again?
Oh, but surely there must be some safe place where I could watch.
Yes, yes.
- A complete change of wardrobe sir.
- Wait, let me see.
A dress, slippers, hat.
- Where's the...
- Here sir.
What you got there?
What is it?
A note, a soldier gave it to me to keep for him.
Why was it sewed up in your coat?
I hadn't any pockets.
I wanted to be sure was safe.
Give it to me.
- Well, the soldier said...
- Give it to me.
It can't be anything important.
The soldiers are always giving us things to keep for them.
- He said he'd be back for it but...
- Where did you get this? I want the truth.
I'm telling you the truth. Why? What is it?
A map of our lines.
- Oh, it couldn't be. Why, he wouldn't...
- And what is this written in code?
I don't know. I tell you, I don't know.
Captain Pierlot.
Yes, excellency.
Get me lieutenant Vancour of the intelligence service.
Lieutenant Vancour is off-duty, sir.
- Who is on-duty?
- Captain Andre sir.
- Andre?
- Captain Francois Andre.
Ask him to come here at once and call the guard.
Yes excellency.
Nina Maria, if you're telling the truth you have nothing to fear.
But if you had anything to do with this... you're going to get the quickest court-martial and execution on record.
Enter.
Captain Andre sir.
Send him in and tell the captain of the guard to stand by for further orders.
Yes sir.
You seem to know this girl.
- Yes your excellency.
- I remember your face.
Where have I seen you before?
- In Bayonne, your excellency.
- Bayonne?
Oh, of course, you were the man with the flowers.
- Were you in the intelligence service then?
- Yes your excellency.
I was detailed to follow the señorita.
We suspected her of obtaining information for the Spanish espionage... but we never could get any proof.
Well, we have it now, there it is.
Captain Lagarde?
- At your order sir.
- Place this woman under arrest as a spy.
Search her and her belongings and prepare an immediate court-martial.
Yes your excellency.
Proceed.
That was a close call.
- So, what do you make of it?
- That's an authentic map of our lines.
Every regiment, every battery, almost every piece of artillery.
- She didn't make this map.
- How you know?-
This is a section of an
English general's staff map.
English? Then the English know our position.
- Seems so.
- Where did she get it?
What was she going to do with it?
Wait a minute, maybe this message will explain it.
Seems to me I've seen this code before, let me see.
The first word is...
- Verify.
- Verify?
That's why she wanted to get to the front lines.
Well, decipher that message as quickly as you can.
Yes sir.
- There's something under there.
- Take that board out.
Proceed.
Finished.
- It did come from English headquarters.
- Verify this map and return.
Will attack dawn of the 21st, dawn?
It's in about 5 hours.
- Send the chief of staff here at once.
- Yes sir.
- Any further orders sir?
- That's all captain Andre, thank you.
Carrier pigeons.
Yes sir, we found them among her possessions.
Oh, captain Andre remain,
I may have need of you..
Yes sir.
- Put them there.
- Yes sir.
- You heard what happened?
- Yes your excellency.
That makes it imperative that we change our entire formation before dawn.
Dispatch the following orders...
Withdraw 2 brigades of infantry from each right and left wing... and place behind the ninth, in the center.
Center.
Concentrate all reserves for a center attack.
Center attack.
15 minutes past 4 o'clock.
Captain Andre, I want you to write a message on that map.
Yes, sir.
Put it in the same code.
Write positions correct...
Except for center.
Center weak.
When they attack that center, they'll get a reception they'll never forget.
- Ready?
- Yes sir.
Attach that map to one of those birds and prepare it for flight.
Enter.
Your orders have been executed your excellency.
The troops are now occupying their new positions.
Good. That bird ready?
- Yes your excellency.
- Open that window.
Bon voyage.
- Thank you captain Andre.
- You may now report back to your post.
Well colonel, we're ready, come on.
- Come to see the prisoner.
- Yes sir.
I've only a moment,
I must get back to my post.
- But I had to speak to you alone.
- Why?
You've done your duty, your conscience is clear.
Conscience?
As if I cared about my conscience.
All these years I've dreamed of you, of a time when this terrible war would be over.
When we were no longer enemies, when I could come to you and make my peace, and now... now to be the one who... why did you do this? Why did you come here?
Why did you do this? Why did you come here?
Didn't you know you'd be recognized...
- put to death if you were caught?
- Yes, I knew.
And I was willing to take the risk.
- It was madness.
- Perhaps.
- Perhaps not.
- I'm not going to let you die.
I love you Nina Maria, my life would be over if anything happened to you.
I'll not let you die.
The battle started.
Yes captain Andre, the battle for Vitoria.
That sounded closer.
Something is wrong.
They're not attacking the center, they're attacking this wing.
Nothing is wrong, everything is exactly as was planned.
Planned?
Wellington never intended to attack through the center but he wanted you to... think he was he was going to so you'd weaken your wing position.
What do you mean?
He couldn't have defeated you in the formation you were holding... but he has a chance now that that formation is been changed.
That's why I came up here with that map... came here where you were, where de
Rougemont was. I wanted to be caught.
My instructions were to be discovered with the map but never to send it.
We left that bit of strategy for you.
You mean that carrier pigeon, the British know that we're the ones who sent it?
Yes and they know as well as you do... that you never would've sent it had those been your positions.
Nina Maria. Guard. Guard.
That's right captain Andre, go back to your regiment.
They'll need you, they'll need every man they can get.
Nina Maria.
Oh. Oh, no.
Shone more resplendent... with jewels and gold.

Nina Maria, I was so afraid we'd be too late.
You hear that? That's for you.
You've made our victory possible, the war is over, Nina Maria.
Spain is ours again.
Can't be.
- The French.
- They fled in disorder, leaving everything behind them.
Ammunition, cannons, supplies, everything.
I mean the wounded.
A man...
He fell out there.
They took him away.
I don't know whether he's alive or, or...
Oh, tell me his name,
I'll try to find out about him.
No, I must go.
Have you, is there a captain Francois Andre... of the French army.
No, but he may be in one of the other shelters.
Diego.
Oh Diego, I'm here.
It's you Nina, don't leave me.
- Don't go.
- I won't, Diego, ever.

The action is set in Flanders in 1616...
...when Spanish rule under Philip III was becoming less oppressive
The horrors of war, however,
remained in the memories of the people of the Low Countries
The theme is not drawn from history
The serio-comic narrative is set in a small town,
with its canal, its houses rich in gleaming woodwork
and its people looking forward to its carnival
The film-makers'choice of this for their setting
enabled them to draw upon the art of the great Flemish painters,
whose works enrich our museums with their truth and humanity
It was doubtless because this film
added joyous good humour to its imagination.
DU CINEMA gave it the highest honour
Get on with it! The carnival begins tonight
FLANDERS AND FREEDOM
Action 36: blow on the fuse and open the pan
Action 37: adjust the fuse
Wake up, Jef!
Action 38:
Take aim
- What's the matter, Jacob?
- lt's my lumbago.
Some parade it's going to be ls the beef really tender?
- The customer has no change.
- She can pay later.
Don't forget my usual three pound joint
They're waiting for me at the Town Hall
- Has your husband gone?
- Yes, and left the work to me
Save four soles for me lt's too late to rehearse now
Put this on the pole for me
Don't forget the four pies for the Mayoress
Carry your ruff carefully
Should l roast the eighth chicken?
No, seven's enough; our Deputy Mayor's a bachelor l've brought your pies, Mayoress
Not such thick peel, girl; you're wasteful
Dry Mieke carefully, especially between the toes l want my arrow. l scored a bull's-eye
Stop it, or l'll tell your mother l didn't think you were such a ninny
Stop provoking the child
And since when has the gallery been a playground?
All you've done is gaze at that medallion, Siska l've done a lot
You'll never finish in time
Mother, if only you knew l know. l was sixteen once, dreaming of a handsome youth
Was it father?
Take care of that cup, l've only two left
Weren't you deliriously happy on your betrothal day?
Delirious? Oh, well, yes...
This morning Jean is going to ask father for my hand l'm so glad
Your betrothal is a day to remember
What if father refuses? l give my consent
Jean Breughel,
a self-portrait at twenty.
He's very talented
Like his father, and he's earning his own living lt does no harm if life's a bit of a struggle at first
Nothing else matters when you're young and in love
You understand artists, mother
Let me go to the Town Hall to hear father's decision
Finish your work first
Add some white to the carmine
Mayor, your pose
These flies are a nuisance lt's because of your cake
At last, Deputy Mayor!
We've been waiting half an hour l stopped at the church to light a candle
To Saint Gudule, in hope of marriage?
Or Saint Roch, to cure his cows
Gentlemen, don't jest about sacred matters
For once you are all here.
Take your poses, please
Deputy Mayor, are you on your mark?
A more martial air lt looks more stupid than martial
And don't hold the standard like a fly-swatter
Don't be rude l can't work properly
You always look different
Your hair was straight, now it's in archangel's curls
To captivate the ladies l'll make mincemeat of him!
Moderate your remarks, my friend
The painter's right l know you're a serious artist, but it's time for a rest lt looks like real linen l'm not that fat lt's a good likeness
You work quickly and don't make a mess
What more can one ask of a painter?
Urgent things for you to sign
- You can recognize my ring.
- You even see my mole.
Have you thought over my proposal,
Mayor?
Are we not in agreement?
No, but we're getting there
After all, our professions are complementary l raise cattle and you dispose of them
You agree to buy livestock from me exclusively
Very nice, but l am giving you my daughter, Siska
Without dowry
- We'll say no more.
- l was only joking. l give you my daughter, but the question is how many oxen, calves and pigs will you buy a year?
Here are my accounts, judge for yourself
What did father say?
- l haven't asked him yet.
- Go and see him now, in his office.
He won't eat you, just do it
Magnificent! l give you my word... my word of honour l'm pleased with you, my young friend
May l have the honour... l have come to ask... l know, you want your money l was young once; wine, women and song are expensive
You mustn't think that...
Enjoy yourself. Your picture's worth all of five crowns l have the honour to ask...
You haven't dined at the Mayor's before? What wines he has l'd rather have a beer any day
Siska, have you come to hear your father's decision?
How did you know? lt's all right, your father agrees
Your happiness makes me happy
- You're very kind.
- You'll see.
You'll live with a husband who adores you
Let me kiss you properly, as a fiancé should
We'll be married in a month, a first-class affair
My delightful, precious girl, in a month you'll be mine
How changeable women are
A draft for five crowns in the name of Monsieur Breughel l didn't come for money, l came to ask for Siska's hand
Too late
Besides, she'll not marry an artist; no paupers in my family
They served ten entrées, eight roasts and twelve other dishes
We're waiting for you
No, l'm still waiting for one more lt's the Deputy Mayor again
Can't you be trusted alone for five minutes?
They should sweep the stairs more often
Anything broken?
Please keep still l'd like to see you in my position
You're moving on purpose
You're paid to paint, so shut up!
What about art?
What's art? l've been painted before without such a fuss
Go back to your dauber
My ''dauber'', sir, was Rubens
Could Rubens paint that?
Not to the brim, l said
Have you seen Jean?
Did you see your father, then?
Speak up lt's the end of everything
You haven't spoken to Jean or your father, so how do you know it's the end of everything?
Crying won't help
The butcher tried to kiss me
Did you slap him? That's my girl!
He said we'd be married in a month
He was drunk
He said father agreed
What cunning! l might have guessed
No wonder your father was so considerate
When a husband's charming, he's up to something. l'll have a word with him
This very instant. Dry your eyes
Never shake burgundy
A butcher, indeed! Why not the knacker?
Have you told your wife? l'm not answerable to her; in my own house l'm...
...master
- Tell her the news now.
- lt's not the right moment.
My dear Cornelia, are you looking for me?
May l call you mother-in-law?
Has the carnival begun already?
Why the sudden regard for this calf-killer?
Do you trade in daughters?
You've made her cry
A girlish fancy
Don't you think l should be consulted?
Like all Frenchwomen, you're never lost for words
Not like you. l've nothing to hide
Let everyone hear what a wretch you are
Wait till we get home
You're a tyrant, not the good father you make out
Appearances are deceptive
Look at them, playing at soldiers
What if you are outnumbered by the enemy?
A rifleman fights to the death, but never retreats
Where's the Town Hall?
Try to be dignified and a little haughty
Open the door. Are you afraid?
How gracefully those mountebanks ride
They're Spaniards!
- Did you hear?
- l'm not deaf.
But it's your problem; rank always brings risks
The Mayor is always hanged first
Where duty calls, l go lt's the royal seal
- What's it about?
- Open it.
You open it, you're oldest
A letter for you, Mayor
Gentlemen, a stiff upper lip is called for
His Excellency,
Don Pedro de Guzman,
Duke of Olivieres, Ambassador of His Most Catholic Majesty,
will spend the night at Boom, with his entourage and escort
Officers of the Guild of Saint Cyprien, rally round the flag!
- Already tattered?
- l've been shot at twice.
But still ours
- You shouldn't provoke them.
- lt's my nature.
- We can but pray.
- Why despair so easily?
The troops will liven up the town
Were you too young to remember the horrors of the occupation?
Passing soldiers bring passing trade
They sacked Antwerp in a night
Young man, hell has nothing like
Spanish fury
Our houses will be pillaged and reduced to ashes
Blood will run in the streets, our women will be violated
Suckling babes will be hurled from the windows before your very eyes and you, city fathers, will be mutilated
Believe me, the slightest resistance will bring death to us all lf there must be a victim, let it be me
My friends, has heaven inspired me? l have an idea
The Town Crier must proclaim this before midday
The Mayor, Father of the City, heeding naught but his own courage is ready comma as always comma to sacrifice himself for the sake of his beloved people
Hurry up, they'll be here within an hour
Do your know your prayers? Say them
Again? God knows them already
Never mind, say them all over again
- lt's Jean.
- Ask him in. l won't have to say my prayers
Don't look so miserable
We may never see each other again
Mother's on our side
Have we time for happiness?
The Spaniards are coming lf anything happens, my last thought will be of you
You were my only love
Have you finished?
What are you getting so worked up about?
Put him back to bed, on his right side
There'll be time enough to worry when...
There, there; lean on my arm
Would you like the smelling-salts?
You are right to chide me. l wish to be a man worthy of... l don't wish to bother your husband l'm here l have come to take my leave...
Your affairs matter little when the enemy is at the gates
- What will you do?
- Don't be inquisitive. l'm not inquisitive, l'm suspicious
Civic interests don't concern women
Have you any consecrated box-wood?
Are you going to fight with that?
Let us not quarrel in the face of the enemy
Let us unite
Get a pair of clean sheets
What's father doing in there? l don't know; stop asking childish questions l suppose you don't know what's going on
You can't see beyond your paintbrushes
Find out what's happening
You stay here; all you think of is kissing and cuddling
Have you got the best linen sheets?
And the pillowcases, too
Kiss me lt's Martha l'm sorry to have to keep going to and fro
Careful, they're not cutlets and steaks
They're shifting the furniture now
For a barricade?
They're not using grandmother's wardrobe for a barricade!
Can't you tell me?
Can't l help you? What shall l do?
Nothing. Matters of civic importance are not for women l sharpened that this morning; it will go rusty
You won't understand; it's a matter of civic importance
- What are you doing?
- None of your business.
What if a thief is watching?
You might explain to me
Matters of civic interest are beyond your comprehension l see the top of the wardrobe
Look again, don't give up so easily
Can you see better?
What are they hammering?
The canopy is in the way
So you won't tell me anything l see the butcher's feet on a chair, his hands over his head with a hammer
Get down, l'll have a look
Do you feel strong? Yes or no?
Poor Siska
What a brute that butcher is
Maybe, but l'm sure he could lift me
Doubtless you have come to... l'll show you the way
So that's the game
Who let her in?
A big, healthy man, pretending to be dead
Because you're scared of the Spaniards l'm not discussing my plan with silly geese
May the Spaniards give you a fitting burial
Shut up, and don't give the game away
All your military displays are just a sham
persons resisting will lead to reprisals
Everyone must remain calm and obedient,
accepting heaven's decree, in the name of our Holy Church
The Mayor is a shrewd politician l'll not put my nose out of doors
- What if they find you?
- l've a good hiding place.
- What about your shop?
- My wife will be there.
- They'll have her skirts up.
- No danger of that.
She's safe, all right
Soldiers aren't bad
What do you know? lt's a matter of civic interest
Admit you're a coward
You men aren't even jealous now
Why bother to resist? lf you're weak, what's the use?
No fighting to the death for the rifleman? Going to hide?
Certainly. l'm hiding so as to fight again another day
Brave deserter
There's no sense in trying to make women see reason
Go to bed, the lot of you
Women, as the men have lost control of the situation, we'll replace them
Let's do without them
But that's impossible
- Why?
- You know very well.
That way men need us more than we need them
Where was l? ln a nutshell, the situation is that the Spaniards are coming
Terrible, armed to the teeth, and we must meet them bare handed
We're beaten already
Since the Garden of Eden, woman has had the strongest weapon
We can't rule, that's the man's job
Don't we rule our house and children?
But we can't rule men
Ruling men is even easier
Women, we've let this go on too long
We followed our mothers' example and let men rule, but today's events have opened our eyes
Let us women set an example to the whole of Flanders by saving the town through our decisiveness and courage
And now deeds, not words
Firstly, the tired Spanish men will be thirsty
Ajob for the brewer's wife lt sounds like a farmyard before a storm
God save us from their help
We must stop this cackling
You two watch from the tower; wave to us when you see them
You all know what to do?
Get ready, then ln silence
Lean on me; be careful the steps are worn
Can you smell the wind of Flanders?
All the distant flowers
Are you sad? Why? l don't know; l feel hot and cold
Sometimes l wouldn't mind dying l feel the same; we're so alike l'll paint you as the Virgin,
Salome, Eve, Joan of Arc... l shall paint you all my life
- What do you want?
- Something for Madame.
- What's that?
- Madame's mourning dress.
As tight as you can
How nice, l haven't changed in five years
l'm the same size as l was at the great Guild banquet
You may look now. What did you want to tell me?
Mother, l know everything; don't go alone to the gate
The other ladies will be with me
You need a man. l'll go
With your bow? Hold the mirror for me now
What if you don't come back?
Why all this dressing up? lt concerns civic matters which are not for men
WELCOME TO OUR VlSlTORS l had to sew up two holes in my dress
You always wear the latest fashion
Sleeves are wider now, surely.
Anyway, l'm so thirsty l can't swallow a drop
Have we got everything?
Where's the key?
Give it another polish, girl lt's too hot to walk quickly
- Are you ill?
- lt's the suspense.
Try to pray. God knows what sacrifices this duke expects
- l'll offer myself.
- Egoist. l want you to say something no one else has ever said to me
That's difficult l love you l haven't a handkerchief to wave
The hour has struck
What do you call the Duke?
Formally, l mean
- Majesty...
- No, Monseigneur, perhaps?
- He's not a bishop.
- Well, we'll see.
Will these glasses be enough?
Where's the key?
Monseigneur, the townswomen...
- He said Monseigneur.
- l guessed right. are waiting to welcome you
Are they pretty?
Let's see l scarcely anticipated such a welcome,
Madame
Monseigneur, gentlemen, please refresh yourselves
Judging by this reception, our visit will be delightful
Alas, Monseigneur, l bear sad tidings
Our town is in mourning for its late, lamented Mayor l am his widow, Monseigneur l beg you...
...journey on to a less mournful town
Madame, your wish will be fulfilled
Our men have come a long way
The Archduke's messengers expect to find you here
The horses must be re-shod
You hear, Madame? As things are, l fear we must stay, but rest assured we shall respect your sorrow
By dawn we shall have left the town quietly
Half-past twelve. lt worked; the Spaniards have gone
Heaven has answered you
- Who was right?
- You, as always.
Shoulder pikes!
The drums will be muted
You are so considerate lt's like the prophet entering the promised land
- They march strangely.
- lt's the Spanish way.
These open faces gladden my heart
Are their husbands working in the fields?
We're the only men
A dwarf, like in a circus!
- What are you looking at?
- Real men.
- You mustn't go out.
- lt's no fun indoors.
How singular of you, Monseigneur
- l've torn my sleeve.
- l'll sew it for you.
- l'm awfully ticklish.
- Your skin is so soft.
Those pleats are most becoming lt's just a simple robe lsn't it a Dominican habit?
The Dominicans attached to the lnquisition l was once Assessor at Toledo; that ages one lsn't blood flowing in the gutters?
They're marching in good order
- My wife is joking with an officer
- Mine's with a friar
What about mine?
She's with the leader
They haven't lost their sense of rank
- Plenty of women.
- We've struck it lucky.
- What was that drink?
- Beer, you had it in Brussels.
- So hairy.
- So dark.
What darling monkeys
One of these men stole a duck from me
Who stole a duck?
Well, if you can't recognize him...
- Hang him by the feet, twenty minutes.
- Hanged by the feet for a duck?
Such a nice boy
By the feet, like Saint Andrew
Discipline is the mainspring of an army
The first men we've seen here
The artist has talent lnfluenced by the Venetians, but nevertheless... lf these are the native men, l pity the women
A little Christian charity; you know nothing of art
My taste is different; l prefer El Greco
- Give me the Register.
- Without written authorization?
- We're abolishing red tape.
- Authority is dead. l'd like to billet NCOs; the senior ranks l can help the Second Lieutenant with his diet l also have room for some of the guardsmen l don't mind the lower ranks l'll make the Chaplain comfortable
A pallet of straw in the stables will suffice for me
First things first
Monseigneur, will you do me the honour of staying at the Mayoral house? l shall respect your grief and stay at the inn
My inn is widely renowned
My husband would not have let anyone else serve you
The rooms have been repainted; not a bug is left
Clean sheets for every guest, even for one night only l must sew your doublet l always have thread on me.
Keep still
Wouldn't it be easier if l took it off?
No, l can reach
- Quickly.
- Are you hard pressed?
- What do you take me for?
- The prettiest woman l ever saw.
- Stop, or l'll be cross.
- Why?
You really ought to pull the curtain
Put it on the tray
- They're here.
- Warn the Mayor!
The guests have arrived
The guests?
The other way round, girl!
Monseigneur, may l show you to your room?
Madame, first l must pay my respects to the late Mayor
Monseigneur, you are too gracious l wish to lay flowers at the bier
How did he die?
Suddenly.
Are there other cases in town?
Yes, very many
Could it be an epidemic?
Better burn the body
You are very brave, but l will leave you to your grief
The poor man did well to die
What do you mean?
Death is sometimes a deliverance, not only for the departed
God bless you
Did you put your banner there on purpose?
- l tore it on a nail.
- l'll sew it for you.
My good sir, what do you take me for?
The sun's in my eyes
Mind my dress
Here is your water, hot and cold
As l thought. lt smells of fish, too
Funny, l can't smell it; l must be used to it
The entire house reeks of fish
The slightest smell upsets me
Open the window l've only a shirt on
So l see; lovely lace.
Malines, isn't it?
Just like mine, as you can see l'll take your word for it
Madame, allow me to perform my ablutions l want to wash!
How many pillows, Monseigneur?
Monseigneur sleeps without pillows
- Monseigneur's slippers are lost.
- l was fond of them.
A gift? l will catch cold if l put my boots on again
Satisfied? How clever to let them into town lnto my very house
Answer me
You can laugh, it's me who's dead l gave them to him five years ago; they've outlasted him
Have your fun
Just wait till the Spaniards have gone
What sort of man is the Duke? l'll introduce you; call him Monseigneur
You have found me some slippers, much better than my own
See that these are not lost
Monseigneur, allow me to present my daughter, Siska
Your sister, surely, Madame
My eldest daughter. l have another as big as him
- ls this your son?
- No, the painter Jean Breughel l knew your father, and l've seen your work at the Town Hall
Painters inherit talent as kings inherit crowns l congratulate you both
The fife is nice, but l prefer drums.
Play something
- A rigadoon?
- No, a charge. l'll improvise, but close the door or we'll disturb everyone
Not on duty, sir? l've done my four hours at the bier.
Where's my wife?
Accommodating the officers
No rows or fights?
Be very polite to the invaders
Haven't you seen enough of our enemies yet?
You're wasting your time with her
That's what you think
Have you come far?
We've come from Brussels
You speak our language well
- He's Swiss.
- From Fribourg.
Try my cigars
- Where are you from?
- Piedmont.
Yet you're both Spanish soldiers?
For the moment l've fought for France against Austria,
Austria against France...
Have you no preference?
Yes, for the highest bidder
See, Albert, they're just like other men l'm in room seven; where is the mistress of the inn? l have something that needs sewing l'm looking for her myself
The sergeant in number seven has something to be sewn
Be nice to him, he's an NCO l'm sorry to disturb you, but have you seen my wife?
She has just gone to dine with the Mayoress
Aren't you going?
No, l'm on duty; l don't like such affairs, anyway l don't enjoy such functions, either
- Excuse me.
- Keep me company.
That's delicate work l have a certain skill.
Do you appreciate needlework? l do some myself, but not so well
Flatterer! Fetch your own work lt's here; this is my room l'm sorry l've disturbed you
You honour my house
Do you favour ribbing?
Two plain, two purl for the feet, and one and one for the legs l use a much finer pattern altogether
- lt wears less well.
- lt's kinder to the skin.
Before profiting from
God's goodly gifts...
let us think reverently of the master of the house
happier than we now that he knows the only true life
Domini exaudi orationem meam. l'm hungry
So am l. l hope you will like my cooking l'm fond of Flemish dishes, Madame
What's that?
The works of Erasmus
Will you bore us with that heretic?
No, l'll sit on him
Fitting tribute
Sit closer
- Do your monkeys eat meat?
- They eat everything.
- You look happier now.
- At least we'll eat well.
- After you, Father.
- l'll not touch a morsel.
Look at the tiny pitchfork
Court manners. Watch how
Monseigneur uses the fork l'm embarrased by being the centre of attraction
What skill l always have difficulty in cutting meat, anyway
Turn the prongs the other way lt's nerves. l can't help laughing. lt's the same at funerals
Come on, play up!
Let's have a lively tune!
No dancing on a day of mourning
You can't make the Spaniards weep over your dead Mayor
The thing is l don't want a riot.
Nonsense. They're well behaved, good customers
Let them enjoy themselves, no one will mind lt's true, there's nothing like an army
Any army is good for trade
Armies are indispensable
The Spaniards have been maligned
Well, that's politics
That's the end! Music on a day of public mourning
Why hasn't the butcher come back? l'm starving
The food isn't for you
Lobster, paté, burgundy
My burgundy! Where's that butcher got to?
You can't trust him with anything.
- He's only just gone
- You've had your dinner!
We bring you the Andalusian breeze from our mountains
How delighfully you talk l shall cool your forehead with palm leaves, like an Arab
Let the Mayoress be your model, ladies
She plies a fan better than any Seville beauty
No one taught me
Please go on, for my delectation
Father, tell us about the lnquisition
That was long ago
For our edification
Not that; the white wine
You remind me of a girl broken by flagellation
Was she naked?
Like Eve before the Fall
She was smeared with honey and a he-goat licked her with his scabrous tongue
Erasmus numbs my bum
Sit on my lap, my lad, don't be afraid
- How old are you lad?
- Forty-two.
Good heavens! Get off at once!
Here l am and here l stay
So that's how it is
When Monseigneur learns of your mockery, you'll be sorry
Look, lad... your lordship
We're family men l'm engaged to be married l'll give you fifty crowns
A hundred crowns
You'll hang
Two hundred crowns if you'll not breathe a word l'll not breathe a word
They've gone to the dance and left me to my reverie
Flask in hand
Quite fortuitous. What have you there?
- You look unwell.
- l'm fine.
Why so flushed? You look feverish l'm ticklish
Are you starting to grow at last?
The Duke disapproves of quick routes to wealth
- There's something in it for you.
- l have avowed poverty.
The dead man isn't dead
So you extorted money from cowards. lt shall be returned l'll give you twenty-five crowns
Fifty crowns
A hundred crowns, for your charities
The only argument that overcomes my harsh scruples
Now let us go to the inn, to discourage deplorable excesses
Take your places for the
Knights of the Arquebus
- Where are you billeted?
- Here at the inn.
Are you well catered for?
Extremely well
Pity, l have lots of room and my husband's away on duty
An earwig has dropped down my back,
Lieutenant!
Shall I lend a hand? lf Monseigneur drinks from this glass, we will treasure it
Monseigneur is not thirsty
Just put your lips to it
Stop pestering Monseigneur
These people are tactless
You do not have to stay, Monseigneur; are you bored?
With you? How could you imagine that?
Shall we take the air? l'm fond of the people, but not in such a sweat
The night is scented with jasmine
They haven't seen us.
They're planning their future lt is never too late at any age to enjoy happiness
This is just a dream; the Spaniards will leave tomorrow
The butcher will come to claim his fiancée
- l'd rather die.
- Have you really thought of that?
- Did you favour the sword or poison?
- Poison.
- l agree, it's much tidier.
- One suffers less.
Tomorrow we shall be united for ever
A single rose will blossom on our graves
- lt's mother l'm sorry for.
- Yes, l loved her, too.
Poor mother
The moon on the water, the songs... it's just like Venice
Have you been there? l dream of going there.
The Leaning Tower.
That's at Pisa ltaly... the sun, the orange trees... l'd love to travel, read poetry by moonlight...
Bathe at night in the Sea of...
Well, the sea that's there l've never known such joys lt's not too late lt is... but l want my daughter to know them
Live now, wait not for tomorrow
Life's roses should be gathered from today
Did you write that?
Do you say that to all the women? lf only you knew how lonely l am
People have strange ideas about the nobility l'm terrified of thunder... and mice. l can't help it lf l could live an ordinary life here, with a wife like you...
That's a dream. All l want is my daughter's happiness
And you alone can help me, Monseigneur
Call me Pedro
Don't ask the impossible of me
Take my fatherless child under your protection
Command her marriage l am your humble servant, Madame
Monseigneur, to show my gratitude l would like... l'll fetch the Deputy Mayor to register their marriage.
- And us?
- Monseigneur, have pity.
Whose fault is it if the dead man is practically a cuckold? l advise you to make less noise
Does it disturb your banquet? lt wasn't us who died l've come for the Deputy Mayor, to act as magistrate
Kindly prepare for the marriage of Siska and Jean Breughel.
Over my dead body!
Don't push me too far, you and your Duke
Get back in bed, he's not far away.
You refuse to come with me?
That's final?
Who dares raise his voice to a widow at her husband's bier?
Not me.
Aren't you delighted by the news of this ideal match?
- Double six
- My backside!
Let us think of higher things.
Sew this for me, will you?
You, too? No, l've run out of thread
Have you seen Monseigneur's Chaplain,
Madame?
He was here a moment ago
Will you marry us?
With pleasure, but in more dignified surroundings
At my home
Excellent, the wine is better there
Between Siska de Witt and
Jean Breughel
Add: Who have declared to us...
- They've told me nothing.
- No sour grapes.
Why sour grapes? l've no idea
That's that
What about witesses?
Where must l sign?
Would you like more candles for the ceremony?
No, let the illumination be in their hearts lt won't take long, just a simple ceremony
Are you ill?
- Control yourself.
- l can't help it.
Try to pray
Don't drink when you're maudlin
Why are you crying?
The wedding brings back memories
All day l've been keyed-up to make any sacrifice
The Spaniards haven't done what people said
They're supposed to rape and pillage. l've waited all day l'm very emotional
Wake up.
Listen to the silence lt torments me most of all.
Tell my wife l must speak to her
What if l meet the Duke?
You won't; his room's on the floor above my wife's l'm staying at your house, lead the way l'm guarding the bier
- Listen, son.
- No familiarity. Take my monkeys.
Sit down!
Animals in my bed?
The Duke's monkeys pay you an undeserved honour
Are you comfortable, Coco?
We have no further need of you
Have you seen my wife?
Why hasn't she come?
She's deceiving you while you sleep. l saw her l shall be avenged!
Do you understand? l'll go through the nursery, onto the connecting balcony
And when l tap with my halberd, l rush to the Duke's room to bar his escape
- What are you doing here?
- lt's obvious.
Have you been feeding the child for the last two hours?
You'll wake the house l knew it! l'm disgraced for all to see!
- Balcony doors open.
- lt's so hot.
Murder, lead me on!
Down with the Spaniards!
Where's my halberd?
Duke! We have matters to settle!
Forward
Go on. lf you kill the Duke you'll be hanged lf you don't, you'll also be hanged
What are you doing, booby?
Must l tickle your neck to make you talk?
A plot against your life. l've come to defend you
Aren't you Flemish?
Flemish by birth, but Spanish at heart
But there are still bad feelings
Even in this house
The Mayor has deceived you l thought the boot was on the other foot
Don't trust him, he's a knave
He was, because he's dead now
May he rest in peace
Your cowardice got me into trouble, but l smoothed it over
Who told you to knock him out? l'll put him out of his misery
No, enough of corpses
Time to go, Father
Milk rolls and chocolate
May you be repaid a hundredfold
For your charities
They who give to the poor, give to God
My lamb, keep these indulgences
The only genuine indulgences, beware of imitations
You've had nothing to drink, Father
- Too hot.
- Keep the bowl.
Look, the Spaniards are going
Spaniards? What Spaniards?
Do not stay here!
I forbid you to stay here!
You will see!
Friends,
His Excellency, Duke de Olivares, touched by our people's good hospitality, exempt from taxes the city of Boom for a whole year!
This is solely ascribable to the heroism of our mayor!
I don't remember this collar...
It's the wedding present from the Monseigneur to Siskar.
- What a perfectionist, this Monseigneur!
- Yes.
 Hark to a wand'ring son's appeal
 Maryland, my Maryland!
 My Mother State! To thee I kneel
 Maryland, my Maryland!
 For life and death, for woe and weal
 Thy peerless chivalry reveal... 
My friends, you want a speech, but...
...I cannot make one at this time.
I must have opportunity to think.
Undue importance might be given to what I said.
However, there is one thing I will do.
You have a band with you.
There's one piece of music
I've always liked.
Heretofore it hasn't seemed the proper thing to use it in the North.
But now, by virtue of my prerogative as President and commander in chief of the Army and Navy,
I declare it contraband of war and our lawful prize.
I ask the band to play "Dixie".
Your daughter craves affection.
Now I ain't got no fortune, but I'm just bubbling over with affection!
And I'm ready to pour it all over her, like apple sauce over roast pork!
Mr Trenchard, I see that you have not the good manners of society.
And for that reason alone, I forgive the impertinence of which you are guilty.
Ooh! I don't know the manners of society?!
Just a minute. I think I know enough to turn you inside out, old gal.
You sockdologizing old man-trap!
... I'm liable to call myself some awfully bad names!
You know, friends, 400,000 dollars is a big pile of money to light a man's cigar with!
Sic semper tyrannis!
Mr Lincoln has been shot.
Oh, I can't make it.
The bone is ramming through the skin.
But we've got to get across the Potomac, sir.
- We won't be safe till we're in Virginia.
- I can't do it.
Hey, you!
Inside that cabin there.
- Come here, boy.
- Yes, sir, captain.
Do you know if any doctor lives around here?
Doctor? Yes, sir. I knows one.
Doctor Mudd. Doctor Sam Mudd.
He lives just around that bend.
- Can I help you, boss?
- No. Get out.
Get out! Come on.
- Sam. Sam!
- Huh?
- There's somebody at the door.
- Oh, it's the stork.
Looking for Aunt Rosabelle's cabin.
I've been waiting for him.
If the stork hasn't learned his way to Rosabelle's after 11 visits, he never will learn.
11? That's right!
Don't you and Martha have breakfast till I get back.
Plenty of battercakes too, cos I'm gonna be hungry.
Keep it turned up, cos it's raining out.
- Doctor Mudd?
- Yes.
His leg's broken.
Can you do something for him?
Yes. Let's get him inside.
I'm sorry to have to cut your boot.
I'm sorry. I know it hurts.
Hurry, please. I've got to be going.
Oh, no. Not on that leg.
You've got a bad transverse fracture.
You'll be lucky if you're on that in a week.
- Just fix it the best you can.
- Hurry!
Let me see. I haven't got any regular splints here, but...
Take it easy now.
- Coming down from Washington?
- No, from, er... Baltimore.
I'd like to have been at the White House last Sunday when Abe asked the band to play "Dixie".
I guess old Abe's all right after all.
Looks to me like he's the only salvation we Southerners can look for.
Him and... God's mercy.
I never thought anybody but doctors had to be out at this hour.
- His mother's dying, over in Virginia.
- Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.
Where's that knife? Oh, thanks.
Dear, get some brandy, will you?
Now, I'm gonna set this leg.
First, I wanna give you a good, stiff drink of brandy.
Think you can stand it?
Thank you.
Now, it'll only take a second or two.
Easy now. Easy now.
There.
There.
It's downright foolish trying to travel on a leg like that.
- I can put you up in a spare room...
- How much do I owe you?
Oh, I don't know.
Two dollars will cover it.
Thank you. Oh, say, look, wait a minute.
I want to give you a prescription.
This is gonna help to ease that pain.
It's a sedative.
I want you to get it filled, soon as you can.
Thank you, doctor.
You've done me a great service.
I'm sorry if I seemed rude or abrupt.
Things like that can't matter to a doctor.
His door has gotta be open...
- Good night, sir.
- Say, I do wish you'd change your...
Good night.
Queer sort of...
Sort of snake, wasn't he?
Mm-hm. How much?
- Huh?
- How much?
Good heavens! 50 dollars.
Oh, Sam, there must be some mistake.
Shall I call him back... or lock the door?
Lock it, lock it! And bar it, too!
And to think I called him a snake.
He's probably a kindly old philanthropist, just looking around for deserving families like us!
At five o'clock in the morning?
Oh, of course!
Philanthropists don't care what time it is.
He probably said to himself,
"Here's a pretty good couple.
"Of course, he don't amount to much.
Just a country doctor.
"But his wife. Poor little thing!
Pretty as a picture, too.
"Tied up to that country pill peddler, stuck down here in the woods,
"as unhappy as she could be, so I'll give 'em 50 dollars."
- He thought no such thing.
- All right. What do you think he thought?
He probably said to himself,
"My goodness, here's the luckiest woman I've ever seen.
- "She's got the sweetest child..."
- Wait a minute! How'd he know that?
Philanthropists know everything.
"As for her husband, no matter how far out in the country he may be,
"he set my leg better than any
New York specialist could do it.
"So I'll just make this his lucky day and pay him 50 dollars!"
Well, if that's what he aimed to do - to give us a lucky day - he certainly knew how to start it right.
Well, it was nice while we had it!
She's ready for you now.
She sure is ready for you now.
Ah, the stork. It's here.
Master Sam, Aunt Rosabelle ain't gonna have no stork, is she?
Whoa!
You! Come here!
You the man said his buggy was stolen last night?
Yes, horse and buggy.
Took it outta my barn.
- Which way the tracks go?
- Up that away.
- They must have come from that way.
- We're on the right track.
- Who lives up that road?
- Doctor Samuel A. Mudd.
- Shall we try him?
- Sure, we'll try everybody.
It's certain he got help from somebody.
- What about him?
- Arrest him. Take him to Washington.
But, I tell you it was not a question of slavery and never was.
It was a question of states' rights.
The constitution of the United States laid down certain fundamental truths.
One of them was that the individual state had a right to secede at any time.
But, what happens...
What in thunder's that?
- That's just hominy grits.
- Oh, hominy grits. Flies over everything!
- Where's your ma?
- She hasn't got up yet.
- Where's your pa?
- He's out.
- What? Who's sick now?
- Aunt Rosabelle, I think.
What ails Rosabelle?
Huh? Oh.
Here, honey, would you mind leaving the room for a minute?
- Why?
- Because your grandpa says so.
Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha, to you! Now run along.
- Shoo shoo!
- Yeah, shoo shoo to you.
- Shoo shoo!
Get out!
- What about Rosabelle?
- Rosabelle gonna have a baby.
- By gad, how many is that?
- She say 12.
What's Rosabelle trying to do? Start a whole new generation by herself?
Jangling bells when you're trying to eat breakfast!
- Yankees!
- Wait!
Sorry, sir. Is this Doctor Mudd's home?
It is.
- By gad!
- Where is Doctor Mudd?
- Who wants to know?
- Lieutenant Lovett, US army.
I am Doctor Mudd’s father-in-law.
Colonel Jeremiah Milford Dyer,
Fourth Virginia cavalry,
Confederate States army.
Well, maybe you'll help us, sir.
We're looking for two men who passed through Maryland last night.
One of them was hurt. Had a bad leg.
Broken probably.
Did you see or hear anything of them?
If you order that animal to keep his nose out of my affairs, I may answer you.
Wait outside, Sergeant. In front.
Have you ever heard of John Wilkes Booth?
Never.
He's quite a well known actor.
By gad, sir, I leave actors to women.
 Rockabye, little baby...
 There were an old woman who lived in a shoe
 She had so many children, she didn't know what to do
 So she spanked them and put them to bed 
Howdy, little Johnny Reb.
What do you call that?
That's my dolly's carriage.
That's the first time I ever saw a dolly's carriage with a spur on it.
Look, you've broken my dolly!
Oh, we can fix that. Come here.
I've done this lots of times.
This will be easy.
And, if I had my way, by gad I'd line up every official of the North, sir and have them shot.
Yes, sir. Have them shot!
And are these the sentiments of your son-in-law?
My son-in-law, sir, is a Southerner.
Then with your permission, Colonel, or without it, we'll wait here for him.
- But...
- Colonel, stay here. And sit down!
You coloured brothers have got to realise that you're no longer slaves, you're free men, and you're as good as any white man in the state of Maryland.
The right to vote is yours and it's up to you to take it.
Don't let him think he can scare you.
You're just as good as he is.
- You're as good as any white man.
- Wait!
Who gave you permission to come on my land and take my hands away?
You can't bluff me, Mudd. You're a slaver and you always have been.
You gonna get off my place or you wanna be thrown off?
- These coloured men are my friends.
- Go on, throw him off.
Get back! Keep away!
Don't you dare lay your black hands on a white man.
Why, you just been tellin' us that we're as good as you is.
Hey, Buck!
Come here.
Yes, sir, Master Sam.
Get back to your cabin.
Rosabelle's baby's born.
Is she, sir?
Well, what kind I got this time, sir?
A fine looking boy, strong as a bull.
Giddy up.
I do declare! Another boy.
That Rosabelle sure do have a lot of children, Master Sam!
You hear that, mule?
Well, whose big girl is this coming to meet her daddy?
It's Martha.
But, honey, you've been crying.
Wait a minute, who made my big girl cry?
The soldier broke my dolly, see?
No, no. There aren't any soldiers around here.
You ought to know that.
Peggy. Oh, Peggy...
- Good morning.
- Good morning, nothin'!
Don't speak to the filthy Yankee hounds.
Come bustin' in a man's home when he's eating.
- Doctor Mudd?
- Yes.
Do you know John Wilkes Booth?
I've seen him... Yes, I've seen him on a stage in Washington.
Would you recognise him if you saw him on the street?
Well, I suppose so.
Yes, I believe I would.
- Was he here last night?
- Of course not.
Bring Mrs Mudd down.
Here, if you harm my...
- What's the meaning of all this?
- You can't even guess, I suppose?
Sam! What does this mean?
What are they going to do?
- Now will you good enough to tell us?
- Certainly.
Doctor Mudd is under arrest for conspiracy in the assassination of President
Abraham Lincoln.
If this court don't have the courage to hang these murderers of Abraham Lincoln, we'll hang 'em!
Let's get 'em now. Burn the traitors!
Gentlemen. Mr Erickson, the Assistant Secretary of War.
Good morning, gentlemen.
I suppose you all realise that as members of the court martial for the trial of the conspirators in the assassination of our president, you have on your souls a grave responsibility.
We realise it very deeply, Mr Secretary.
The object of this trial is not to determine the guilt or innocence of a handful of rebels, but to save this country from further bloodshed.
The solemn truth is that the Federal
Union is on the verge of hysteria.
That is why the trial has been placed in your hands rather than in a civil court.
Because men of the sword can be hard.
And hardness is all that can save this country from riots, mob rule, even the resumption of the war itself.
- Have you any suggestion, sir?
- Two, to help you to be hard.
First, you must not allow your judgement to be troubled by any trifling technicalities of the law, or any pedantic regard for the customary rules of evidence.
Second, and most important,
You must not allow yourself to be influenced by that obnoxious creation of legal nonsense, reasonable doubt.
- Is that clear?
- Yes.
Briefly, the voice of this court has got to be the voice of the people.
Before you start,
I want you to hear that voice.
Listen to it.
Bring the prisoners.
Prisoners, to the bar.
This court is now in session.
- Mr President.
- The Judge Advocate General.
The death of John Wilkes Booth, who was shot down while resisting arrest in Virginia, has left us eight members of his criminal band.
So, in the name of the government of the United States, a crime of assassination and conspiracy to assassinate Abraham Lincoln, then President of the United States, is charged against the following...
David E. Herold.
Lewis Payne.
George A. Atzerodt.
Michael O'Laughlin.
Edward Spangler.
Samuel Arnold.
Mrs Mary E. Surratt.
And Doctor Samuel A. Mudd.
Doctor Mudd, I'm General Ewing.
With your permission,
I should like to act as your council.
Thank you, General.
We'll fight together now, as we once fought each other.
Thank you.
With the permission of the court, we will begin the cases in order.
We will start with the charge against George A. Atzerodt.
But isn't there any kind of news you can give us about Doctor Mudd?
That's all they're gonna tell, what you see on the board.
That's War Department's orders.
"War Department's orders." Ha!
- Didn't know they had one!
- Ssh!
Good night, Sam, darling.
The government will now present it's case against Doctor Samuel A. Mudd.
Tell them I've got to speak.
I can't let them treat me the way they've treated these others.
General Ewing, instruct the defendant to remain silent and respect this court.
I'm confident, Mr Erickson, that after observing the conduct of these trials,
Doctor Mudd’s respect for this court is every bit as great as my own.
Frank J. Thomas will take the stand.
Tell the court what you know of Doctor
Mudd’s loyalty to the Federal Union.
Doctor Mudd was a dyed-in-the-wool slaver.
Yes, sir. Slaver.
Doctor Mudd’s name was on the prescription, which I failed.
Doctor Mudd served in the Confederate Army.
Doctor Mudd denied that he'd ever seen Booth.
Doctor Mudd denied everything, until I showed him Booth's boot in his own home.
Doctor Mudd, when I examined him in prison, confessed to me that he set Booth's broken leg and then aided him with directions how to reach Virginia.
- The case is ended.
- No! No!
The case is not ended.
Here's one defence you're gonna hear.
- The prisoner will observe order.
- Why? What more can you do to me?
What threat have you got left?
You can hang the innocent as well as the guilty.
Because you nine gallant officers and gentlemen, have stripped yourselves of your pride and honour.
I'll not go without trying to blacken your memories with your insane injustice you'll carry on your souls till the day you die.
Till the day you die you ask yourselves in your heart three questions.
Does an assassin confide his plans to anyone?
Was I, a physician, in the plot because it was part of John Wilkes Booth's plan to break his leg and to need me?
Does a man, whose first devotion is no longer to a lost cause or to any flag that flies, but to his wife and his child, risk any act that could only cause misery and heartbreak on innocent lives?
In the sight of the holy God I worship,
I'm innocent.
The court will ignore the remarks of the prisoner.
Sergeant.
And you still can't tell me what they've decided?
Lady, I must have told you 40 times that I don't know any more than them bulletins.
He's coming now.
But, General, isn't there any possible means of stopping things, just for a while?
I'm using every legal means that I know of.
Be brave, my dear.
Peggy. Martha.
No, darling. Don't do that.
It won't be long now.
We'll all be back together again.
Sam, don't you know?
- Haven't they told you?
- Told me? You mean that you've heard.
Sam, the verdict... was guilty.
Guilty.
I don't know, it's...
It's like a nightmare. You can't fight, you can't run, you can't do anything.
All the time it's coming toward you.
But, darling, we haven't given up.
We're not through yet.
No, we're not giving up.
You and Martha and me.
But if Daddy has to stay away a little while longer,
I want you to take care of Mummy.
Dry her tears, try to make her happy.
Tell her, too, that in the bottom draw of the roll top desk there are a lot of old bills that Daddy never got around to collecting.
Maybe they'll get enough, though, to send you to school, buy some new dresses.
Try not to forget Daddy.
Come on, come on. Let's go!
We're not giving up. Not yet, dear!
Hey, bring him downstairs.
My cell is here.
Ha! You ain't going to need a cell any more.
I'll see General Hunter.
I know him very well
Martha.
Order halt!
Oh no, not now!
No, no, not now! Please!
Steady. Steady, dear.
Say, you got the best place in the yard.
Over yonder is where they're comin' out.
Courage. Courage, my dear.
Right face.
Forward march.
Right face.
Forward march.
Sam! Darling!
Courage. Courage.
Well, looks like that's all.
He's going to live. Live!
Present arms!
Oh!
Well, I guess the show's over.
- What about him?
- Life imprisonment on Dry Tortugas.
A new bunch from Washington prison, sir. Hard ones.
- Report 'em to the Office of the Guards.
- Yes, sir.
Mudd. Number six.
All right, left step.
- Next.
- William A. Dunger.
William Dunger, insubordination, striking an officer, ten years.
Left step.
- Next.
- Otto Lehrman.
Otto Lehrman, desertion, 20 years.
You'll never make it, Otto. You're too old.
The mosquitoes will get you!
Left step.
- Next.
- Samuel A. Mudd.
Doctor Samuel A. Mudd.
Doctor Mudd, I've been waiting for you.
So all they gave you was life.
Couldn't hang you, eh? You're gonna wish they had before I'm through.
Take a look at him, you filthy rats.
Take a look at the man who killed Abe Lincoln, the greatest man who ever lived.
Look at him! Watch him get what's coming to him.
- Next.
- Left step.
All right, drop your chains.
Attention.
Now, before we go any further here,
I want you to listen to me because I know exactly what you're thinking, every mother's son of you.
You're figuring on whether you're gonna be able to break out of here.
We've got a little way here of putting thoughts like that out of your heads.
Follow me.
You first, doctor. Come on, get up!
Halt!
Now, whenever you slobs get to figuring on breaking out of here,
I just want you to give a little thought to this moat.
It runs all around the island.
It's 75 feet wide and 35 feet deep.
You know what we keep in it?
We keep pets in it.
Nice little pets!
We got more pets in that moat than you can count and sometimes we feed 'em.
Not often. Oh, no.
But just for you, because I like you,
I'm gonna give 'em a little treat.
Now watch close.
Buck.
Move on, white man.
- A prisoner, sir.
- Just a minute.
Now, you know that's quite interesting.
Those are mosquito larvae. See there.
But not very interesting to anyone but a medico, I'm afraid.
Well, I'm also a physician, sir.
No? Now I am pleased.
That's Doctor Mudd.
Oh.
Well, I thought that...
I thought that as another physician, you would understand the circumstances.
The obligation of a doctor to give aid to anyone, whoever he might be.
Mr Mudd, if you assumed you might find sympathy here, get rid of the idea.
The profession you dishonored is ashamed of you.
Ashamed of your membership in it.
As a doctor, I may tell you that I despise you even beyond the rest of the world.
It would be of no use for me to swear to you on the honour of the profession we both respect that I had nothing to do with the death of Mr Lincoln?
It would be of no use whatever.
I'm sorry, sir.
Master Sam. Master Sam.
- Oh, Buck.
- Master Sam.
I'm sorry, sir, but I was too scared this afternoon.
I couldn't say nothin' to you then.
Oh, I know. Tell me, what are you doing down here?
I been here a month waiting for you, sir.
You see, Miss Mudd, she told me to get on down on this here island.
So, here I is. Done got on down on it.
Buck, you've given me the first hope
I've had since this nightmare started.
Yes, sir. I guess so.
But, here's some soap I brung you.
- What? Oh yes, I guess I do need it.
- Yes, sir.
But, it's for the mosquitoes.
- Mosquitoes?
- Yes, sir.
- You put it on your face...
- Oh, I know.
Because there's more mosquitoes on this island than I ever seen before.
- I know.
- Watch it!
My home, sir.
Darling, General Ewing.
How do you do, General. This is Judge
Maiben of the District Superior Court.
- How do you do, Judge.
- How do you do, sir.
The judge is a Yankee, but he's honourable.
- He's gonna get Sam out of jail.
- Colonel!
Won't you sit down?
Let me take your things.
Please sit down.
Let me explain, General.
At my request, and for my own satisfaction,
Judge Maiben has gone over the case, word by word.
On the evidence produced, no civil court could hold Dr Mudd for ten minutes.
- You have some sort of plan, Judge?
- The plan is Mrs Mudd’s.
No judge dare devise anything quite so, er... extreme.
I explained what happened
to the writ of habeas corpus you obtained for Sam.
The government simply laughed at it.
But if a writ was served on him in, say, Key West, a civil municipality, it would be honoured?
Of course, but Doctor Mudd’s not in Key West.
- I know he isn't... yet.
- What did I tell you?
Great Scott, Mrs Mudd, you surely wouldn't dare...
General Ewing, I'd dare anything for my husband. and it isn't only freedom I want for him, it's exoneration, too.
He's innocent and I want them to say so to the world.
- But if we wait...
- Wait! Wait for what?
For the government to kill my husband.
That's all we've done is wait, and trust and have faith. I'm sick of waiting.
- I found a way to Sam out.
- Just a moment, Mrs Mudd.
Now, all I have to say is this.
If Doctor Mudd should be able to deliver himself to the civil authorities in Key West,
I could have a writ of habeas corpus there to be served on him.
Under its protection, he could be brought back here.
I'd re-open the case and I feel sure give him a far different trial to the one he had at the court martial.
But, as for how Doctor Mudd is going to be able to get to Key West, well, I think I'd rather not hear.
Good luck, my dear, and remember,
I won't be the only Yankee who'll be praying with you.
- And don't let anything disturb you.
- I won't.
- Good day, gentlemen.
- Good day.
We'll sell, pawn, mortgage everything.
We'll get enough money... Oh.
You understand what this means to me, don't you?
It's all that's left of our lives.
Sam's and Martha’s and mine.
And it's only your support behind us that we're asking.
You can leave the escape entirely to me, sir.
Within 24 hours, I'll have 5,000 of my old brigade under my command, we'll seize a war vessel or two and blow the whole prison to ashes and deliver Sam in Key West with a guard of honour.
I'm sorry, Mrs Mudd, but if you're set on such a foolhardy plan,
I must withdraw from the case.
But we have to do it. He's got to be free to be tried. It's the only way.
- Don't you see?
- I'm sorry.
- The risk is too great.
- By gad, sir...
And if you take my advice, you, too, will abandon this mad scheme.
What do you think?
By gad, we'll show these chicken-hearted Yankee lawyers!
You leave it to me.
I'm getting tired of this fiddlin' around!
Lawyers! Lawyers are no good...
Lawyers! Habeas corpus!
There.
See that? Stonewall Jackson gave me that. Pure Toledo.
And if I don't get 150 dollars for that,
I'll split the heart of the swine that dare offer me less!
Open the door!
Master Sam.
- Master Sam.
- Yes, Buck.
Oh, thanks.
Yes, sir, that's me. I fixed my name up a little bit to make it sound kind of nice
Buck, I'm ready.
- Tonight, sir?
- Yes, tonight.
- But the moat and sharks?
- I'm gonna try the bridge.
- But they got a guard on it.
- I know.
Watch it!
If I could go with you, I can arrange to be the guard that's on the bridge.
That's right! We could both go together.
Now listen.
There's gonna be a boat, gonna flash two lights.
I have to swim out to it.
Nice view?
What's outside?
Just outside.
Don't start anything you might be sorry for, doctor.
Second guard detail, forward step!
Guard detail, halt!
Right face.
Number two, step out.
What were you doing down in that cell block?
- Says which?
- I saw you!
No, sir, it weren't me.
As you were.
Left face. Forward step!
- What's up?
- I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.
- What post is that boy Buck on?
- The bridge. He swapped.
That's what I thought. Place him under arrest and bring him here.
- What's up?
- Mudd’s out.
Wait!
He's out, but I don't want him back alive. Do you understand?
Post extra guards at the bridge
We'll see if we can give this Judas what the court martial should have given him.
Tell 'em to shoot!
Guard, watch that...
No... Wait.
Guard that magazine over there.
Quick step!
Halt! Who goes there?
Corporal of the Guard, the star boarder's out.
Rankin don't want him back.
His orders are to shoot on sight.
If I see him I will.
With pleasure.
Mudd’s out. Double all your guards!
Guards, halt!
Cover that cell. You cover that out there.
Go and watch that gate.
The rest of you follow me.
Soldier, you're under arrest.
- But I just...
- Keep it to yourself. Move!
Take your post.
Buck.
Buck.
Buck!
Bring out those pieces, on the double.
Wait!
There he is!
Keep firing. He'll never make it.
If we don't get him, the sharks will.
- What sharks?
- What sharks do you think, sir?
Sergeant, with that barrage on the water, you're lucky if you've got a shark left in 100 yards of this spot.
Stop firing, you fools!
You wanna drive those sharks away?
- Keep your eyes open.
- I don't see anything down here.
Look yonder. He's outside.
There's a boat putting in toward him.
Rankin, man two boats.
I want that man back.
- Alive. You understand?
- Yes, sir.
Boat crew. Number one.
Number two.
- Man your boats!
- Man your boats!
Get on your way!
Pull, you measly rats!
Starboard a little more.
There he is, boys. Pull him in.
Pull, you measly rats! On your way!
You're all right now, Sam.
Come along. That's the boy.
He's all right.
Now, get him over here in this bunk.
There you are, Sam.
- Oh, darling, you're so cold.
- Easy, now. Don't get him excited.
- Oh, my darling, you're wounded.
- He's all right now.
- You're an angel.
- Everything's arranged for.
You're gonna have a new trial.
And Martha’s waiting.
- Where's Martha?
- In Key West.
She hasn't forgotten me?
Oh, my sweet! Not for one little minute.
By gad, I'll soon stop this!
- You stay here with Sam.
- Dad. Dad! No!
They can't take you back. They can't!
How're you, Judas?
And then, the Prince leaned down and kissed the sleeping beauty on both her eyes, smack, smack.
- And what do you suppose?
- What?
The sleeping beauty waked up.
Mama!
Where's Daddy?
Daddy... couldn't come, darling.
He wanted to, but...
Oh, sweet dear. Darling.
It doesn't mean forever. He'll come yet.
He will, I promise you.
Where's grandpa?
Grandpa's gone away.
He's gone along, long way away.
Forever?
Forever.
How long has it been,
Master Sam?
I don't know. Three, maybe four days, I guess.
Master Sam, can I have a little more of that water?
I ain't even heard no bugle calls.
Ain't even seen nobody.
No food, no nothing.
I guess everybody just done run off and left us.
Reckon it'll do any good to holler again?
No, I've hollered till I'm hoarse.
What do you suppose happened?
I don't know, Buck.
Maybe just as you say, that they...
...they have gone off and left us to die, maybe.
Tell the captain of that ship
I've got to have those supplies.
Tell him I got 1,000 hospital cases here and only one doctor.
Tell the Commandant again, I'm sorry, but I refuse to put in.
Tell him he's a filthy yellow coward, with my compliments.
Tell him I've waited five days for him to be a man and deliver me my medicines.
And if I don't see some action out there inside of five minutes,
I'm gonna turn a cannon on his tub and blow it to kingdom come, government ship or no government ship!
That'll make you sleep a little.
You're gonna be all right, son.
Morning, Clark.
Are you all right, sir?
Just tired. Very tired.
It's a hard job, son.
Always a hard job when you don't know what to do...
...and got no one to do it with you.
If it hadn't been for you and a couple of others who've stuck by me...
I don't wanna catch it myself, sir.
Hmm. That's something I can't promise you, because I don't know.
I don't know what causes yellow fever,
I don't know how to cure it.
I don't know how it spreads, where it comes from...
...or where it goes.
I'm going to see the Commandant.
White doctor, he got it.
- Hey, soldier.
- Yes, sir.
My compliments...
My compliments to the Commandant and tell him...
- Yes, sir.
- I can't come.
Tell him I've got to go to my quarters.
White boss sick.
He's got it, too.
Soldier...
Soldier... Come here. Help me!
- Come here, you fools.
- No, sir, white boss. No, sir.
You swine, I tell you, you've got to help me up.
Doctor.
Doctor.
Doctor.
- Well?
- He says he can't do it, sir.
- Says he's scared.
- Scared?
If ever I get my hands on that muck's throat!
Imagine the hound!
Loading my supplies on rafts and just shoving 'em toward the shore.
Look at 'em.
Scared to land 'em, scared to touch 'em, scared to take 'em when they're sick!
Holy mother, how long do they expect to live?
Forever?
Beg your pardon, sir.
If the Commandant pleases, there's a doctor among the prisoners.
Doctor Mudd.
Mudd. Doctor Mudd?
Come on.
Open up.
Doctor, I'm here on a curious mission.
I want your help.
- My help?
- I need it. Desperately.
Doctor, this island is a pest hole.
It's steaming with yellow fever.
The worst epidemic we've had in years.
I've got 3,000 men here, soldiers and prisoners.
And those that aren't dead or dying are crazy with terror.
And we're all trapped here together.
What's all this to me?
That's what you must decide for yourself, sir.
And the good Doctor MacIntyre?
The good Doctor MacIntyre is down, bad.
You're quite right.
You couldn't possibly be in a better position to tell me and my men to go straight to the devil.
No one would understand it better than I would.
In your place, I'd do it myself.
But in spite of that, in spite of the fact that I can promise you no reward, that I can offer you nothing but exposure to death,
I want your help.
Once before, I was a doctor.
I'm still a doctor.
Thank you, Doctor Mudd.
Buck. Buck. We're going up in the open.
Will you give me a hand, sir, please.
That was the last straw when they heard about Macintyre’s dying.
They all quit. They're in the mess hall now. Barricaded, guards and all.
We got to do something, sir.
Those patients are alone. Deserted.
Have I any authority, sir?
You give the orders,
I'll take the responsibility.
All right sir, thank you. You wait here.
You, come with me.
- Aren't you afraid?
- Doctor, I'm scared to death!
Yes, so am I.
- Steady!
- Don't come no closer, white man.
Stay where you is.
Us men ain't gonna come out there for nobody.
I'm not gonna ask you to come out.
But you're gonna listen to me.
I'm just gonna tell you what you're gonna get.
You're gonna get hanged, all of you.
You're soldiers and you mutinied.
You deserted your posts, you shot at your officers.
Can't get away with it.
Here's what they're gonna do to you.
They're gonna take you before a judge.
Gonna take out in a courtyard and build a scaffold.
And you're gonna have to build your own scaffold.
And when you get that done, you're gonna do some digging.
You're gonna dig your own graves.
And then the law is gonna hang you.
They're gonna put a rope around your necks and choke you, choke you till your eyeballs pop out and your tongue swells up.
You ought not talk like that.
That ain't no Yankee talking just to hear himself talk, that's a Southern man and he mean it.
Yes, sir.
But for those of you that wanna be saved, I've got a proposition.
Us don't wanna go near them yellow fever men.
- Do you want to hear it or not?
- Yes.
There's nobody going near those yellow fever men but this orderly and me.
But I need help outside. I need workers, coloured boys, water boys.
Boys willing to do what I say.
Any of you boys willing to do that,
I promise to save from hanging.
He sound like a nice man.
I don't wanna go near them yellow fever boys.
The white man say you don't have to.
And besides, I'd rather be beside them yellow fever boys than hanging with my eyeballs popped out.
- Coming out!
- All right.
Now, I'm gonna give all of you just one minute to make up your mind.
That's it. Come on, all of you. Hurry up.
Hurry up and don't forget, I'll keep my promise to every one of you.
Coming out!
Come on, all of you.
Begin tearing out those windows.
I want to get some air in this hospital.
Double time now.
Come over here, you fellas.
Get ready to soak these blankets.
I want to wrap those men up till I wash that fever out. Hurry up!
- You and I are going in.
- Think this will do any good?
Oh, I don't know, but it'll make them comfortable.
Here, you men, put those blankets over your faces.
They're gonna smash these windows and get some air in this hospital.
All right, tear 'em out!
How're you, soldier?
Get away! Judas!
What about that wind, sir?
It looks like a hurricane...
Let it blow, let it rain.
It's cooling, isn't it?
It'll help to blow these blasted mosquitoes away.
We'll take them in their order.
This one first.
How are you feeling, Buck?
I'm feeling good, Master Sam, since you chased them mosquitoes away.
Sure seems a long way from Maryland.
Long time.
Long ago.
I wonder if Rosabelle done and forgotten me.
Forget you after...
...after 12 children? That's impossible.
That Rosabelle sure is one real woman, ain't she, Master Sam?
Ssh!
Well, how's it look today?
All right, I guess.
How long do you think these supplies are gonna last?
Where's the medicine coming from two days from now? Out of the air!
And how long do you think
I'm gonna last? Forever?
You've got to get some sleep.
You've had five days of this.
You're exhausted.
Right out yonder, not a mile offshore, there's a ship full of supplies and half a dozen doctors.
Not country doctors brought up on bellyaches, but real city doctors.
And the whole United States government can't make that boat come help us!
- Here, let me put you to bed...
- No!
I'm sorry. I'll go to bed, because... because I'm tired.
Get up.
- Get up and come with me!
- What is it, sir?
Come with me, I need your help.
Doctor, you're sick.
Of course I'm sick. I got yellow jack.
I'm the doctor, but I got yellow jack.
Didn't you know that doctors could get yellow...
I'm the only doctor in the world that's got 1,000 cases...
...got 1,000 cases and ain't got no medicine.
- Won't you tell me where we're going?
- Here. Get up there.
Open that door. Kick it open.
- You the gun crew?
- Yes, sir.
Get up! Man your gun. Hurry up!
Pull down that ladder.
Get the signal lamp.
Hurry up! Get up.
- What's he say now?
- He says it's impossible, sir.
It's too dangerous in the storm.
Tell him again I say, "put in".
Tell him if he doesn't, I'm gonna fire.
Excuse me, sir, but that's a government ship.
Tell them again I say, "put in".
Get ready to drop one near.
- He says he won't, sir.
- All right, fire.
- What's he doing now?
- They're putting out to sea, sir.
All right, hit him.
- You can't do that, doctor.
- You fool. I gotta get that medicine.
I gotta get those doctors. I'm sick, too.
I got yellow jack like everybody else here, but I'm a doctor.
I gotta look out for things. Come on, give it to 'em, I tell you. Fire!
- But, captain, us can't fire at the flag.
- Fire that gun, Negro!
Fire!
It hit the mast.
Get ready to hit him again. Again!
He's turning.
He's heading in.
He's heading in, doctor. He's heading in!
How's everything this morning?
Looks like I'm going to live.
Doctor, this is something
I've prepared to send to Washington, by special messenger, today.
Of course, I'm in no position to speak for our government. Yours and mine.
Because I do love the flag I serve and because I'm jealous of its honour...
I'd...
I'd like to read this letter to you.
It's to the President of the United States.
As Commandant of the military prison at Fort Jefferson, Florida,
I can testify that the final checking of the recent yellow fever epidemic was the direct result of extraordinary and unselfish courage, bravery and skill, on the part of Doctor Samuel A. Mudd.
On behalf of the personnel of the post, including officers, enlisted men, civilians and prisoners,
I take this means of urging executive clemency for Doctor Mudd, as a reward for heroism far above and beyond the demands of duty.
I wrote that this morning.
And every man on this island will be glad to sign it, I promise you.
I'd like to be the first.
- With your permission, Major?
- With Doctor Mudd’s permission.
Thank you, Sergeant.
Come here, darling.
Darling, Daddy's coming home.
And when he comes, he may not look like he did when you last saw him.
But don't say so.
Don't look at him like that, dear.
His face may be old and sad and tired.
And he may be thin and his hair...
But don't notice it dear.
Just... just kiss him.
Kiss his cheeks and his eyes and his arms and his wrists.
- Whoa.
- Much obliged, sir.
Thank you, Master Sam.
Giddy up.
Rosabelle!

My son.
Have they killed my son?
My husband is a slave.
God, have mercy.
Our Father, who art in Heaven...
Thirty-five, thirty-five.
But it's not enough.
Look at this gold
Christian hair.
Thirty-six.
Thirty-six.
Give us this day our daily bread... and forgive us our trespasses...
Here. For your 36.
...as we forgive those who...
Of all the Christian captives... not one so tall and slender.
Thirty-seven and no more.
Thirty-seven? Sold.
And may Allah give you joy.
His mercy is everlasting.
Come on, you!
No. No!
Of all the captives, this is the fairest!
The cross! The cross!
Let me kiss the cross!
That one is fair.
Your cry shall be heard through all the worid.
Now, how much will you bid... for this daughter of a Christian prince?
Forty dinars.
Forty dinars, you say?
Forty.
Not enough.
Who will bid more for the Christian captive?
Forty-five.
Forty-five.
Forty-five.
Forty-eight. Fifty.
Behold the Sultan,
Saladin the Conqueror.
Saladin!
Make way for Saladin!
Hail to Saladin, servant of the Prophet!
Make way for Saladin,
Sultan of Egypt!
Make way for Saladin!
Make way for Saladin!
Stay, infidel!
Hearken to me, unbeliever, foe of Christ.
Strike him down!
Let him speak.
You rule here in Jerusalem.
You have conquered.
The Holy Land is yours.
But never will you conquer this!
Strike him down!
Woe to the unbeliever.
I go to all the kings in Christendom.
A mighty host shall arise and arm!
Who sets foot in Asia with a sword... shall not return.
The swords of the Prophet will conquer.
Go, Hermit.
Carry your thunder across the sea.
Tell your Christian kings what you have seen.
Your women sold as slaves... your knights trampled under our horses... your gospels cast into the flames... the power of your cross broken forever!
Stop, blasphemer.
I go. But I will come again.
And with me shall come the great Crusade.
The armies of Christ shall arise and redeem his tomb.
The cries of these Christian women sold into slavery shall be answered.
The host of our Lord shall fall upon Islam... like a mighty wave of the sea.
Woe to you, unbeliever.
I go to preach the great Crusade.
And so I have come to summon you, Philip,
Lord King of France... to war for your faith... to lead the multitudes on Crusade... to free the city that was hallowed by the footsteps of our Lord.
Your answer, Philip,
Lord King of France?
I will go.
So be it.
Until now, you have fought for the man who is Philip.
For France.
But now, your sword, your life...
I give to God... that the gates of Jerusalem may be opened... and the tomb of our Lord set free by this Crusade.
Crusade. Amen.
So be it.
Philip, Lord King of France.
Amen.
Sire... if you go, what of Richard?
Richard of England?
Richard the Lion-Heart of England.
With you away...
Will take France.
Is that what you try to say,
Conrad of Montferrat?
Quite.
Richard is betrothed to my sister, Alice.
And with Alice
Queen of England...
The English Lion will be caged.
You're a wise and clever king.
I do my duty and safeguard France.
Richard would not dare break this pledge of marriage.
Alice and I leave at once for England.
I will accompany you.
I desire to see this English king.
# Oh, Richard ruled in England
The Devil reigned in hell #
# And both were mighty monarchs
Who governed passing well #
Both at the same time.
Watch out.
He's aiming for the mark.
# Till Richard went to Hades
The Devil a visit to pay #
# And with his fire and brimstone
Poor Satan ran away #
# And broke his pitchfork, too ##
Guard yourself, Blondel.
I'll try a singing target.
Here he comes.
Look out, Blondel.
Blondel, come out and fight like a man.
I can't fight you with this!
Smithy, how goes my sword?
Hair of the devil, it's not done!
Here, sire.
A fair, sweet blade!
Well, it should be.
You take long enough, old Hercules.
No one can hurry fire or steel.
Well, you can't shape steel with words. Here.
But, sire...
Every lick that goes into this now... will come out in a fight!
Nay, sire, you can't shape steel with love taps!
Give it to me.
Love taps?
Aye, lad... Sire.
It wants my arm to strike it right.
Your arm? Well, who do you think strikes the harder blow?
A king or a smith?
Why, a smith, of course.
All right.
We'll find out!
How?
You can have the first blow, and no love taps, remember.
Strike my king?
Lord bless me, no.
That'd be treason.
I command you to strike, and strike hard.
Mercy on my soul.
# The smith dislikes to strike his king #
# Yet washes for the blow #
Well, what holds you, man? Strike.
# Now will the birds begin to sing ##
Oh, my...
A love tap, my dear fellow, nothing but a love tap.
Now then, you keep your...
Nay, sire. Wrong man.
# The King prepares to smite the Smith #
# Oh, let the welkin ring #
# The stars he'll see are not a myth #
Now, you keep your feet.
# Here comes the royal swing ##
Me lute!
Devil take you, Richard, you've done for him!
What?
Oh, no.
He's got to finish my sword.
Get up, Hercules.
Come on, get up.
You better finish my sword.
Come on, man. Get up.
The sword, man. The sword.
The sword.
Something hit me.
Something hit him.
Aye, something hit you.
It was the King.
The King.
Aye! The King.
Laid his fist to me jaw, he did. A fair, sweet lad.
The Earl of Leicester comes.
Sire, the Earl of Leicester.
Sire.
What's the matter, Robert?
Have you seen a ghost?
I've seen the King of France.
Philip, here in England?
He is at the castle.
Will you come to greet him?
Does my saintly cousin come in peace or war?
He comes in peace.
And he brings his royal sister.
Oh, Alice.
She's no dove with an olive branch.
Your father gave his pledge to France... that you would wed the Princess Alice.
The surly-tempered witch.
Your father's pledge was England's pledge.
You cannot escape this marriage.
Now, what do I care for France?
Fighting. Always fighting.
Fearing no devil and praying to no God.
Well, why should I?
I know my horse, Fauvel.
I know the feel of a lance in my hand.
I know what it is to see men go down before me.
Now, look.
This sword's being made for me.
No other arm shall wield it but mine.
With this sword, Robert...
I'll swing a stroke from Norway down to Spain.
Why should I fear and pray for what I don't understand?
The King of France is waiting.
How much longer,
Prince John, will Richard keep France waiting?
Who knows what Richard will do?
He's not an ardent suitor, is he, Brother?
If he knew that the fairest lady in Christendom were waiting, I'm sure...
He does know.
I sent Leicester to tell him.
And I offer apology for him.
Richard is my brother and I am deeply ashamed.
Ashamed?
Of my future husband,
Prince John?
Ashamed of your king,
Prince John?
Yes. For many things, in many ways.
Why, it is an open scandal.
He has no faith in God.
He is a graceless...
Richard, by the grace of God,
King of England...
Duke of Normandy and Aquitaine,
Count of Anjou.
Cousin Philip.
Welcome to Windsor and to England.
The greetings of France.
Oh, the Lady Alice.
I am not accustomed to waiting, Richard.
Even for a betrothal kiss.
Well, let's postpone it.
Well, what other guests have we?
Conrad, Marquis of Montferrat and my friend.
Then he is mine.
England gives welcome to Montferrat.
I understand now, sire, why men call you the Lion-Heart.
Well, why are we all so glum?
Come on, wine, music.
Ho, lads, wine!
Blondel, song.
Richard, we've come to...
You have not heard my troubadour, have you?
Shall it be of love?
No, no, no. Hunting.
And why not of love?
Come, Richard.
We'll pledge to my sister,
Alice.
What's the cross,
Cousin Philip?
The sign of the Crusade.
The Crusade?
I go to Holy War in Palestine.
A miracle is happening,
Richard.
Men are arming everywhere for our Christian faith.
Emperor Barbarossa of Germany has taken the cross.
So has Leopold of Austria.
And Hugo of Burgundy goes.
Well, let them go.
I've no love for monks and shave-pates.
And I'm content in England.
And France.
You realize why we've come,
Richard, Alice and I?
How long do you propose to honor us here?
My time is short.
And so I give you happiness,
Richard... in your marriage to my sister.
I've no wine left,
Philip.
I can't drink that toast.
The pledge of marriage was given by your father.
Yes, but Alice and I were just children then.
The late king, your father, desired this alliance with France.
Philip, you know that the late king, my father, and I... seldom agreed on anything.
The Lion squirms in the net.
Richard of England... do you refuse to wed the Princess of France... to whom you are pledged?
Sire, there's a great crowd at the outer gate.
They seek the King.
Well, let them in!
You'll answer me!
Yes, yes, Philip.
Later, later.
Open the gates.
Open the gates, I say.
Richard!
You will get an excellent view from the balcony.
Open the gates!
The Hermit is here.
Let the Holy Man through.
Oh, ye men of England... the kings and the peoples of every other land... are going forth to war for the cross.
Will you close your ears to the cry of Christendom?
No!
Do you fear to die where Christ, our Lord, suffered... to give you life everlasting?
No!
Never!
Will you turn from him... now that he is being crucified again?
Behold, in the City of His Sorrow... darkness falls again upon the Mount of Calvary.
Will ye deny him now?
No!
Never!
Come to the army of the cross.
Lift up your swords, not for lust or gold... but for the Lord, our God.
Come, ye men of England.
Take the cross to your heart... that ye may find the real, true cross.
That man's inspired!
Now shall the son depart from the father... and the husband from the wife.
Many who go shall not return.
Therefore, all other earthly promises and vows are wiped away.
By the devil's teeth,
I see the way out!
Father!
The King! Make way for the King! Stand back!
King Richard.
God bless you, Richard.
Good father, do I hear it right?
The taking of the cross will cancel a pledge?
No other pledge shall bind one who has taken the Crusader's Oath.
Then give me the Oath.
Richard of England, will you join the Crusade, forsaking all else?
Yes,
I will renounce everything.
Even the lovely woman to whom I'm pledged.
Richard of England... do you swear you will not lift your hand... against any other who wears the cross?
That you will not turn aside from the Crusade... until the Holy City is again free?
I swear.
Give me the cross.
You can lie to yourself,
Richard... you can lie to me... but you cannot lie to God.
This cross will humble you,
Richard.
It will burn into your heart till your pride is in the dust.
The King takes the cross!
That settles Philip.
But not the Lady Alice.
What is she going to do?
Father, give me the cross.
Alice of France...
No!
This is work for men!
Work for all Christians, men and women.
Work for men and only for men.
I'll get you knights,
I'll get you men-at-arms... yeomen, esquires, grooms, cooks, blacksmiths...
I'll even get you a minstrel.
Here, Blondel!
Sire!
Alice of France... do you swear you will not lift your hand... against any other who wears the cross?
Let me through to the King.
I have the King's sword!
Hear it ring!
Oh, men of England, the battle cry has sounded.
England is at war!
Mother, I must go.
Alan, my boy, you may never come back.
Mother, I may touch the wood of the true cross.
Out with your steel, men, for the Crusade!
For the Crusade!
Good father, consecrate these swords to the service of England.
To the service of God.
Amen.
Let God's blessing be upon these swords.
May they rescue the tomb of Christ our Lord.
May they restore to his people... the cross on which he died.
Amen.
Check.
The fire burns low.
An eventful day, my princely friend, an eventful day.
You may have won a throne.
Check.
You're a treacherous man,
Montferrat.
In good company, John.
Check.
John, supposing your brother,
Richard, does not return... from this Crusade?
Well, hazardous business, these Crusades.
Many will be killed.
Even kings.
By the infidels?
Yes, of course.
By the infidels.
Check.
Then I would be
King of England.
And marry Alice of France.
Would England and France when the Crusade is won... make me King of Jerusalem?
Yes.
Sire.
You know, John...
I have the direst premonition tonight... that your lion-hearted brother will never return to England.
In fact, I can give you my word for it.
Raise the standard of France!
Forward!
Raise the standard of England!
Leicester!
The knights are mounted, sire!
Sound the trumpets.
The Crusade goes forward!
# Onward Ho!
To conquer the foe #
# On for the God and faith we know #
# Bearing the sword of the Lord
The Sword #

Goodbye, darling.
You will come back?
Yes, darling.

# Even to the last Crusader ##
It's the English, Tina.
The English.
Lend a hand with that cart.
Right row to the ship.
Left row to the English tent.
Oh, isn't it glorious?
They're going to the Holy Land to free the tomb of our Lord.
Oh, I wish I could carry a sword and fight with them... or nurse the sick or...
Tina, we must do something to help them.
Crusader!
Crusader, where is your king?
Eh, lass?
Don't you know him?
No.
But I've heard the minstrels sing of his chivalry... his bravery and his gentleness.
Yes, his gentleness.
Yes, they sing of a saint in armor leading the blessed Crusade.
Then they're better singers than I am.
What do you want of him, lass?
I have flowers for him.
Flowers?
He'd rather have a side of beef.
We haven't eaten for a week.
Oh, but we have plenty.
We shall help you.
My father has thousands of cattle.
Where's your king?
Thousands of...
Yonder.
Bring that catapult into line with the street.
Hail to the King.
Come along, Tina. Hurry.
# Round the mountain now we go #
# A fair young face to see #
# And now the ocean billows blow #
# Broad as they can be ##
Hold those horses!
Block the wheels or it'll go through that house.
Stop it!
Fix the left block.
Look out!
Get the other block, then pull.
Now, get the chocks under those wheels... and bring the back wheels over to that side.
Tina, that's King Richard.
Get a company of crossbowmen... and bring them up here to give these men a hand!
Aye, sire.
Now, come on, look lively there!
Come on, pull over there.
Don't fret that horse, you idiot!
Look out!
The King's horse!
He's hurt the King's horse.
That's blood.
He'll catch it.
Blockhead, you'll hang if that horse is crippled.
Now then, men, all together!
Aye, sire.
That can't be Richard.
Oh, yes, that's Richard.
Move along, there.
What are you waiting for?
I hope he starves.
The King!
We've got to see the King!
King Richard.
Sire.
Silence!
Well, what is it?
Sire, we've had no food for days.
We must eat.
I'll get you food, but stop howling for it!
But, sire...
King Sancho.
I'll give you a bond on the City of London for your cattle.
And what should I do with your City of London?
Can you move London to my poor Kingdom of Navarre?
No, no, Richard.
You heard my price.
I cannot pay it.
But Navarre is a poor country.
And I am a poor king.
We drove our cattle down to Marseille... to sell to you Crusaders for gold... not promises.
By the devil's teeth,
I'll take what I need.
No, Richard.
Seize all his cattle!
Richard!
You wear the cross.
You may not plunder another Christian.
Or strike one.
Still, there is a way.
Well?
I have a daughter.
A fair, sweet girl.
Just like a flower.
A girl, but ready to be married.
You understand?
No.
Marry her.
Marry your daughter?
Yes.
Well, by the devil's beard.
I'll settle a dower on her.
Herds of cattle and sheep.
Shiploads of grain.
A hundred cartloads of fodder for your horses.
You can marry your wench to the devil!
Tighten your belt,
Robert.
Scour the countryside, glean what you can.
The country's bare as a wolf's tooth.
Sire, the men are truly desperate for food.
Yes, sire, give us food.
We sail tomorrow.
We can't ship horses without fodder.
How many head of cattle have you in Navarre?
Six thousand.
How many?
Seven thousand.
How much grain?
Barley and wheat enough to fill four cargo ships.
I'll marry your wench.
My Lord, think...
No, not now, Robert.
Would you crown this unknown girl
Queen of England?
I said I'd marry her.
I said nothing about the Crown of England.
Well, she'll arrange that.
Drive your cattle and your carts here into my camp.
I'll marry your girl when we come back from Crusade.
Promises.
Promises.
All right, all right, here.
This is surety that I'll marry your daughter whenever you say.
What's her name?
Berengaria.
And you'll marry her tonight.
Yes, yes, yes, tonight.
My son.
Make way for the King of Navarre.
Robert, have his cattle driven into our lines... and the grain stored in our ships.
This wedding, sire...
No, never mind that.
Just tell the men that they'll eat tonight.
Yes, sire.
But, Daughter, he's your saint in armor.
Your pure white knight.
The minstrels sing his praises, you've heard them.
You'll bless me for this marriage, my child.
Never.
If you'd given your cattle to help the Crusade... this never would have happened.
Well, I did!
I gave him the cattle, and he gives you a crown.
But he's such a noble king.
So gentle.
Didn't you strew flowers in his path?
Why, Daughter, what's the matter?
# When the sun goes down for another day #
# And the Dipper dips to the Milky Way #
# We up with our cups with a heigh and a ho #
# Heigh-ho and down we go ##
Hercules! Steady, my dear friend.
Hey, Blondel, no, no, no.
You'll sing for your dinner.
# Oh, the man in the moon has a light in his eye #
# And the Dog Star barks in the midnight sky #
# Our king he lifts his cup on high #
# Heigh-ho and down we go ##
All right, Blondel, you've earned your dinner.
Here we go.
Let's cut this up.
Well, what is it?
The lady is waiting.
What lady?
Berengaria of Navarre, whom you will marry, sire.
Marry?
Sire!
# Oh,
Richard is no ladies' man though something of a sinner #
# He eats and drinks and now he pays Navarre #
# for Blondel's dinner ##
Shut up, fool.
No light matter to wed the daughter of Navarre.
I hope she's lighter than her father.
Sire, let me lead you to the bridal bower.
I'll do more.
I'll send you in my place.
But, Richard, I can't. I...
Draw my sword.
Huh?
Draw my sword.
Now bear it with you to the chapel.
A sword to a wedding?
Have you never heard that one of royal blood... may send his sword to the altar in his stead?
Good Brother?
Marriage by token is your privilege, sire.
Oh, what will Navarre say to this bridegroom?
That's for you to worry about.
Come on, Blondel.
Don't keep the lady waiting.
I'll tell your wife, Blondel.
This is a bad beginning.
He's a ladies' man.
# Blondel, he would a-wooing go #
# Whether his mother would let him or no #
# Blondel, he would a-wooing go #
# Whether his mother would let him or no #
# Heigh-ho and down we go ##
Where is King Richard?
Here.
That's King Richard's minstrel.
And King Richard's sword.
Yes, my Lord of Navarre.
He sent his sword as a token.
A token? Of what?
Isn't Richard coming?
He is in despair that he cannot be here.
What?
A thousand duties assail him.
And so, in his place, he sent me.
You?
His minstrel.
No, no, milady.
He didn't send me in his place.
He didn't send me.
He sent his sword to be wed to you.
Just as if my king himself were here.
Your gallant king.
I am tricked.
Tricked by that rogue of a Richard.
That breaker of promises!
I'll have the blood out of you for this.
Good Brother, tell him.
Sire, the man says true.
If your daughter marries this sword, she marries King Richard.
Eh?
Such is the law.
The law? The law?
And the marriage will hold?
Until death.
There, you see, my child?
You were mistaken.
Didn't I tell you
Richard was a man of his word?
A pure knight, a noble king.
Let us begin the ceremony.
No!
No, I will not.
But, my child.
No, Father, let me go.
Please let me go!
But it's the man himself you will marry.
Richard of England.
And you agreed for your father's sake.
For the Crusade.
For the Crusade.
Begin.
We have come together before God and his angels... in the place of this holy church... that we may couple together these two bodies.
# When Jupiter winks at Venus below #
# And the nightmare gallops to and fro #
# We'll drink to our king with a heigh and ho #
# Heigh-ho and down we go ##
All right, Hercules, we'll go and see if my horse is lame.
Oh, no, no, keep your seats, keep your seats.
Eat your fill and drink deep.
And look to your horses before you turn in.
Tomorrow we sail for Palestine.
Long live Richard!
Long live Richard!
Long live the King!
Wilt thou, Richard, have this woman for thy wife?
To love her and worship her... and keep her in sickness and in health?
And all others forsake... and hold thee to her, to thy life's end?
I will.
Or he will.
Wilt thou, Berengaria, have this man to thy husband?
To love him, obey him, worship him... and serve and keep him in sickness and in health?
And all others forsake... and hold thee only to him to thy life's end?
I will.
I join you, man and wife, in holy wedlock.
The ring.
Amen.
Wilt thou give to the sword the kiss of peace?
And what token shall I take Richard?
There!
My child!
Milady!
There's your token.
Take that back to him.
Milady.
Tell him that's all he'll ever see of me.
I hate him and I'll never, never forgive him.
My child!
You are beside yourself.
Sire. Your sword.
Oh, then I'm married.
Yes, sire.
And what did the wench say to her husband?
Well, she said many things.
Oh, sire, if you could only have seen her.
Well, I don't want to see her.
Here, give me a cloth or something to bandage this wound.
Well, what's this you have?
A token from your bride.
Soft, isn't it?
Just what I need.
Hup, son. Hup, hup.
Well, she said it's all you'll ever see of her.
That's good.
I'd not be seeing her anyway.
We set sail in the morning.
Look, there's the English King.
Sire.
Doesn't an ·ngel looking down from heaven smile?
Not upon a devil looking up.
What, no Godspeed for a poor Crusader?
Not for Richard of England.
Oh, so you recognize me?
Yes.
And who are you?
It wouldn't matter to you,
Richard.
Ride on.
As you wish, milady.
Very nice, too.
On me oath, yes.
Wonder who she is.
Your wife.
What?
Berengaria, your wife.
You married her last night.
Why the devil didn't you tell me she looked like that?
You didn't ask me.
Oh, you half-wit.
Richard, you can't go back now.
The fleet is waiting and the King of France is ready to sail.
May a poor devil look up to heaven again?
Are you so far above me, my ·ngel, that you cannot hear?
Perhaps it's the smell of brimstone... that makes you tilt your pretty nose so high.
Now I see you have two eyes.
Or are they stars?
I confess my sin.
I ask your forgiveness.
I'm in the dust at your feet.
So is my veil.
Well, you see, my horse was wounded.
Yes, so am I.
Here, come back.
Wait a minute, you're my wife.
Richard. King Philip will sail with the tide.
Wait.
This is not England.
You don't command here.
Nor is it Navarre.
So you don't command here.
Well, I can always leave.
Oh, no.
Not till I know you're coming to Palestine.
Palestine?
You're very lovely,
Berengaria.
I'll never go.
Well, we'll see. Navarre!
Let go my wrist, you're hurting it.
Well, stop pulling then.
Navarre!
What's the matter?
Is this my wife?
Now, Richard, now.
That was all settled last night.
You can't change your mind now.
Is she my wife?
That's what I said.
You have the cattle.
We had a priest and witnesses.
Have her board ship then...
I'll never set foot on your ship.
No, not on mine.
I go on a war galley.
You'll go on the ship of the women.
Richard!
The tide is full.
We must sail.
Attend to her, Navarre.
Wait.
She has a will of her own.
A very strong will of her own.
It's not easy...
You have her on that boat.
Or when I come back,
I'll visit your halfpenny kingdom... with fire and sword, and burn your castle over your ears.
He would do it, Berengaria.
You must go on that ship as he says.
No!
But, Berengaria.
No, never.
Never will I set my foot on that ship!
But, Berengaria, it's such a beautiful ship.
Milady, the master of the ship.
Your pardon,
Princess Alice... but there's another lady come to the ship.
Well, who is she?
I'm sorry, milady... but I'm afraid that she must have this cabin.
What?
Gracious lady,
I assure you it's the truth.
Surely you have made a mistake.
This is the royal cabin.
Thank you. Tina.
I am Alice of France, betrothed to King Richard.
Who are you?
I'm his wife.
His what?
His wife.
I was married to him last night.
We can share the cabin.
Share, with you?
Why, I'll kill you, you lily-faced thief!
Let me go. She's stolen the throne of England...
Lower away!
Oh, infidels!
Hear ye the challenge of the kings of Christendom.
The Crusade has crossed the sea.
Our Christian armies surround your wall.
In the name of God... we call upon you to surrender the city of Acre.
What is your answer?
They've shot him!
Assassins!
Kings of the Crusade, this is their answer to our herald.
Insolence.
Arrogance.
We'll send them back
10,000 like it.
They struck the first blow.
We'll answer them with blood.
Milords.
Have you forgotten... that the cross upon which our Lord died... is within the walls of Acre?
We must try to open those gates without more bloodshed.
I have granted a truce.
A truce?
Saladin, Sultan of Islam... comes now before this Council of Kings.
Let him see the might...
Kings of the Council...
I've kept you waiting while I sought for one whose ship was delayed.
Milords, the Queen of England.
Do you hear, Philip?
I am presenting my wife.
I greet the Princess of Navarre.
Philip!
Milord of France.
Your Majesties.
Leicester.
And why do you grant truce to the infidel?
To hear if he'll make terms.
We'll make our own terms with the sword.
Milords, Saladin comes.
Saladin the Conqueror,
Sultan of Islam.
Christians, who is your leader?
I am.
Who speaks?
Richard of England.
The Lion King.
And I am Philip,
King of France.
And who are my other enemies?
I am Hugo of Burgundy.
And I am Frederick,
Duke of the Germans.
Michael,
Prince of the Russians.
Sverre, the Norse King.
I am Leopold of Austria.
William of Sicily.
I am Nicholas,
Count of Hungary.
And I am Conrad of Montferrat.
You see, infidel, we are many kings.
There is room in Asia to bury all of you.
Insolence!
Boasting and wine go well together.
Ho there!
Bring wine for the infidel.
We, of the true faith, drink no wine.
You refuse me?
Not you, my noble enemy.
I refuse the wine.
Well, we'll drink water then.
A goblet of water for the King of the infidels.
They told me he had horns like the devil.
I think he's magnificent.
Water may be poisoned as easily as wine.
It is our custom that someone first taste the cup offered a king.
Richard of England offers no poisoned cup.
Drink.
Well?
She did well!
Brave.
Well, what have you come to say?
Must my wife give you courage to speak as well as drink?
Your wife?
She does not wear the Crown of England yet.
Robert, give my wife escort to my tent.
Your Majesties.
Milord Sultan.
Now, what brings you here in truce before us?
I offer peace to you, foes of Islam.
He does well to make peace.
You will surrender Acre, and then Jerusalem...
I will surrender nothing.
Go, while yet you live.
Lead your armies and your ships over the sea, whence you came.
I say to you, go in peace while you can.
Boasting is cheap.
Life is cheap.
We do not fear you.
We are many kings.
And I am one king with many armies.
Go and live, stay and die.
Bold words.
We'll answer you with steel.
With this sword,
I'll cut my way into Jerusalem.
No. You'll find the blade too dull.
My sword dull?
Here, fetch me a mace.
An iron mace.
Guard.
Bring up a chair.
Set it in line with this.
My sword dull?
Good, Richard.
The Lion King has shown us the strength of his arm... not the sharpness of his sword.
What does he mean?
The blade cut iron.
Here. Cut through this... in midair.
That's impossible.
It offers no resistance.
Why, look!
Work of the devil.
Magic.
Lmpossible.
Witchcraft.
The devil is in him.
Black magic.
A sharp blade, my Lord Sultan.
But Christian armor is not made of silk.
Just as easily will I cut your Crusade to pieces... unless you accept my terms.
From you, Sultan of Islam,
I accept only war.
Milords.
My answer is war.
No terms. War.
War.
For God and the cross.
Very well, milords, war.
Within a month,
I shall enter Jerusalem.
By Allah... you shall never pass the gates of Jerusalem.
Arrogance.
Unbeliever.
Speak no more.
This is war.
The Saracen's steel is sharp.
Richard, by what right... do you call yourself leader of the Crusade?
I don't care who leads if it be through Acre toward Jerusalem.
Or who gives command if it be to battle.
But, Richard, you know very well...
Milords, please.
You must not quarrel.
England and France are the hope of the Crusade.
Yes.
Conrad is right.
You must stand together until we win Jerusalem.
The Oath of the Crusade binds us.
Richard gave no thought to that when he made this marriage... if marriage indeed it be.
Philip.
Steady.
Marriage it is,
Cousin Philip.
It is more than a marriage.
It's a studied insult to France.
Be careful!
Richard.
I regret the insult.
But not the marriage.
Third hour of the night... and all's well.
Good night, Tina.
Good night, Tina.
Oh!
Good night, Tina.
I said, good night, Tina.
You didn't find your way to my tent, did you?
I liked my own tent better.
How should you know?
My bedposts are Matthew,
Mark, Luke, and John.
They are consecrated to my safety.
I, too, as your husband, am consecrated to your safety.
Then stand on guard, outside.
Is it Saladin that you fear?
He looked at you today,
I noticed.
Saladin would not force himself upon me.
And he's an infidel, remember.
Infidel.
Had you but half his courtesy.
Have I spoken harshly?
That's easily changed.
Might it please my sweet queen... to come to her husband's tent?
You see, you don't answer to courtesy.
Get up.
No.
Matthew, Mark, Luke... and John...
I wish you to understand that this lady is my wife.
Who wishes to be alone.
I just wanted to assure them.
What are you doing?
Why, I usually remove my spurs before retiring.
If I scream, every woman in this camp will come.
All right then, scream.
Listen to your minstrel meowing of love.
You don't know what love is.
Perhaps I do.
Even if I can't put it into pretty words.
Oh, it isn't what you say, it's...
It's what you are.
I'm no pale gallant to sit at a woman's feet.
No, I should say you're not.
You take by storm.
What's a woman to you?
A citadel? A herd of cattle?
Oh, Richard of England, it's not as easy as that.
Now, will you please leave my tent?
As you will.
Since you go with me.
Richard, what are you doing?
Let me go. Richard, let me go!
I told you to go to my tent and that's where you're going.
I am not going to your tent.
Put me down.
You are.
If I can find you.
Where the...
I'll get you out of here.
Look here, I'm your husband.
You're not.
This is my husband.
This is what I married.
For goodness sake, be reasonable.
You little devil!
My husband will protect me.
Drop that sword, you wildcat.
Not until you get out of my tent, you blustering barbarian.
Milord of England. Milord.
King Richard.
Sire.
Pardon.
Well?
We're attacked, sire.
Saladin attacks from the gate.
Run the mantelets forward.
Mass the knights.
Charge behind them.
Stanley, take mantelets one to 50.
Sire, your spurs.
Blount, take mantelets 50 to 100.
Aye, my lord.
If you'd been in my tent... they wouldn't have had to look all over the camp for me.
Well, I didn't ask you to come here.
Mass the longbows on the right flank, crossbows on the left.
Aye, sire.
Tell your men.
Carry the flares forward.
Aye, sire.
You didn't ask me to come here.
The next time you will.
Sire, they're throwing wildfire from the walls.
All right, cover the war engines.
Wet hides for the war engines.
Where are the French?
They mass for attack on the west tower.
We'll strike toward the gate.
Now then, where the devil is my sword?
Richard.
Robert, stay here. Keep her in bed if you can. I can't.
Sire, my place is with you.
Stay here.
If the infidels break through our lines, guard my wife.
He may be killed.
Yes, milady.
And I must stay here.
I love him, if you do not.
Milord.
Dear lady, a dreadful thing has happened.
To Richard?
Yes, dear child.
To my sorrow.
He's wounded.
No.
He's...
No.
He's not dead.
He's not harmed as yet.
But a messenger has arrived from England.
Bad news?
Tell me, my dear.
You love Richard greatly, don't you?
I am his wife.
He never comes to your tent, yet you love him.
No.
Your lips say no... but your eyes just now when you thought him dead...
Tell me, what's the matter?
What does the messenger say?
You sew a Crusader's banner.
Tell me.
But you stand between England and France.
And anyone who stands there,
Berengaria... is in the way of the Crusade.
Yes, in the path of God.
What right have you to say a thing like that?
How terrible that the lovely thing you are... could destroy Richard.
Destroy Richard?
And the Crusade.
But how could I?
I'd give my life...
There'd be no need for that if only
Richard would give you up.
Annul your marriage, send you away.
Does Richard want that?
No. No.
Richard will not let you go... and it is not in your power to give him up.
My dearest child, you must be very brave... for you alone can help him now.
But how?
How can I possibly help him?
What can I do?
You must step from the path of the Crusade.
You mean, kill myself?
What else is to be done?
Richard has been summoned to the Council.
He stands now at bay before the kings.
Take me there at once.
Richard, you are no longer
King of England.
And who has dethroned me,
Cousin Philip?
Your brother, John.
My brother?
Who brings you such report?
Tell this Lion of ours the news from England.
Tell him who holds the throne of England.
King John.
"King" John?
You lie, you treacherous dog.
Milord of England.
Who dares believe his words?
I have proof.
I am England's king!
Not if I support your brother John.
How bold we grow with treason.
I serve France, not England.
Richard, put that woman aside.
Marry my sister, and I support you against John.
John offers to make Alice
Queen of England.
Richard, you must make your choice.
She was sold for cattle.
I am land and power.
What does love matter?
I am France.
Richard is England, or John is England.
I marry England.
Choose, Richard.
Who gives Alice the Crown of England?
You or John?
Kneel, Berengaria.
What would you do?
Kneel.
Richard, please.
Give me up, put me aside.
You will kneel, Berengaria.
Think. You will destroy yourself, the Crusade... for me.
What she says is true, you will destroy yourself.
Please, Richard.
I, Richard, King of England... bestow upon thee,
Berengaria of Navarre... the right of sovereignty.
In the presence of these
Lords of Christendom...
I grant thee the royal privileges... that thou shalt rule by my side and share my crown... and only death shall deprive thee of this power.
Berengaria...
Queen of England.
Whoever challenges this act makes war with Richard.
I have only one answer.
Renounce this woman or France withdraws from the Crusade.
Milord of France, you must not.
Marshal of France.
France must not withdraw.
Call back your men.
No, milord.
We need you.
France and England are the two arms of the Crusade.
I will not fight beside him.
Don't let him withdraw from the Crusade.
Make peace with France.
This will end the Crusade.
Give her up and the Crusade will go on.
This woman means war with France.
Give her up, Richard.
Send her away.
There is no other way.
Put her aside.
This maid will be your undoing.
Listen, Richard...
I stand firm!
Father, stop them.
Make peace between them.
You'll regret this.
Cease your quarrels.
I'll follow Philip of France.
Aye.
Cease your quarrels.
Will ye fight over your petty kingdoms here?
There is but one kingdom, the Kingdom of God.
Richard of England, you lied when you took that cross you bear.
You've broken faith with man and God.
Do you hold to that woman against the Crusade?
Will you destroy the Crusade...
Silence!
I have my wife at my side... and English swords to follow me.
I'll open the gates of Jerusalem if I go alone.
Now what do you think of your husband?
You're magnificent.
There's no one like you,
Richard.
And you no longer hate me?
For standing alone against them all... against the worid, for me.
I want to kneel to my king.
Oh, Berengaria.
It's I who should kneel to my queen.
England will be so proud of you.
But England must be proud of you.
If you could only love me a little.
Oh, Richard.
Much more than a little.
Does anything else matter?
Yes.
What?
What matters most is you're wrong.
For making you
Queen of England?
I loved you for doing it, and still you're wrong.
If I could pluck the stars from Heaven... to make a brighter crown for you...
I'd do it.
It's lovely.
But it's nothing.
You are everything.
The crown is yours, not mine.
The fate of these men, the Crusade itself is in your hands.
Richard, if you break with Philip, you wrong God.
And make me guilty.
I have broken already.
But you'd make peace if I were out of the way.
England, France, what's it all matter?
All that counts now is that
I love you and you love me.
But it means your throne, your life.
Richard, send me away.
To a convent.
If you went to 40 convents...
I'd smash my way through 40 walls to find you.
I won't destroy you.
Destroy me?
Why, you've given me something to fight for.
I never knew there was such a power of fighting in love.
Would you let our love stand in the way of the whole worid?
In the way of Heaven, if need be.
Why do you look at me like that?
Berengaria, what are you thinking of?
Richard, hold me.
Closer.
I am yours.
I do love you, and will love you no matter where I am, forever.
You'll be here in my arms forever.
Nothing else counts, does it?
Nothing.
I'd give my life for you.
And I will give mine for you.
Kiss me, beloved.
One kiss to last through all eternity.
Oh, Richard.
Make me proud of this sword that I call my husband.
It brought us together.
Till now, it's kept us apart.
The priest said,
"Until death."
Richard... promise me one thing.
Anything.
Swear that you'll go on to Jerusalem, no matter what happens... that you'll let this sword stand between us until the Crusade is won.
I swear to you, Berengaria... that this sword will enter Jerusalem... and rest on the tomb.
And if that is not done... may it stand between us as man and wife... forever.
Make way for Saladin.
Saladin comes.
"He sendeth his bolts and smiteth whom he will."
Oh, my Sultan, why do
I see you in these garments of the Christians?
So that I may pass through their lines as a Christian knight.
Your life is sacred to Islam.
You must not risk it.
My life is in the hand of Allah.
I must ride to our army in Jerusalem and return with 100,000 horsemen.
Or Acre will fall.
Allah grant that you return unharmed.
As Allah wills.
Have the horses brought to the shepherd's gate in the east wall.
The foes of Islam shall be as dust... and the wind of the wrath of Islam... shall scatter their dust over the earth.
Fourth hour of the night... and all's well.
Fourth hour of the night... and all's well.
Fourth hour of the night... and all's well.
Stop!
You can't go out there.
See what you nearly got?
What are you doing here?
Holy Mother, the Queen!
Forgive me, milady.
You can't go out there.
There's nothing out there but death.
Many have died for the Crusade.
I seek the Hermit, the Holy Man.
He's not out yonder.
Then find him for me.
I want him.
I want him to comfort someone who is about to die.
Yes, milady.
Milady,
I can't leave my post.
But you can if I order you.
Well...
I shall keep your post for you.
You?
I will wear your mantle.
Then no one will know.
Milady, it's kind of rough for you.
I must have something to cover my head.
Will you give me your helmet, too?
Why, yes.
Now, do I look like a real sentry?
A very funny sentry.
Please go.
I'll find him.
I'll bring the Holy Man to you, milady.
Thank you.
The Sultan is leaving.
Let your eyes be the eyes of hawks.
There!
A Christian.
Father...
Iook.
Go back, Father.
Run! Run for your life!
Master.
Master, we must ride on.
We must go.
Allah has sent her to me.
I will not let her die.
# Oh, Richard ruled in England
The Devil reigned in hell #
# And both were mighty monarchs
Who governed passing well #
# Till Richard went to Hades
The Devil a visit to pay #
# And with his fire and brimstone #
# Poor Satan ran away! ##
Look out! The King! The King!
Have that one posted there.
Quick, pass it fast.
Here, here, come along, come along, Smithy.
Hurry up with those scaling ladders.
Sire, a ladder's no stronger than its weakest rung.
All right, you'd better see there are no weak rungs then.
Aye, sire.
Here, you on the siege tower!
Aye, sire.
Get those crossbows to the front of the platform... and the longbows to the back!
Aye, sire.
The King.
The King.
Let me through to the King.
Stand aside, men.
Sire. Sire.
Sire, the Holy Man...
Queen of England... captive.
Robert.
England's Queen is captive behind that wall.
The Holy Man!
The Holy Man is taken!
Where?
See his staff.
His broken staff. See!
Sound the call to arms.
Trumpeter, sound the call to arms.
Berkeley, start the siege tower forward.
All men to your posts!
Fifty horses for the tower!
Roll the mantelets forward to the foot of the wall.
Aye, sire.
Bring the mantelets to the wall.
Forward!
Bring up all horses to the tower!
Brace that siege tower.
Get up there! Get up!
Men, forward! Men, forward!
Heave forward!
Sire, they storm the walls of Acre.
The Hermit has been captured.
Raise the Oriflamme of France.
We join the attack.
In God's name and the King's!
To arms! To arms!
Quick, men!
The Christians attack!
Thousands are coming!
Christians attack.
The Christians are coming!
The Christians attack!
Let the war drum call to battle!
Summon every sword of Islam to the wall!
Light the fires upon the walls!
# Even to the last Crusader #
# We stand for the Lord, our God #
# Death or life may Christ attend #
# Holy cross and tomb defend ##
Keep those ladders going over the moat!
Show the Christians their Holy Man.
Look, Christians, here is your saint.
The Holy Man!
They're killing him!
What are they doing with him?
Let your cross save him now.
The Holy Man!
Back, Christian dogs, or we kill your Holy Man.
Tell us, Hermit, what shall we do?
On! On, ye men of the cross.
Good Father, if we attack, it means your death.
Fear not, my sons, attack!
Within these walls is the cross of our Lord.
Dog of an unbeliever!
Send back your people or you die!
Yes, death!
Death!
Send your people!
Send them back!
I command you, in the name of God, attack!
Stop his blaspheming voice!
In this sign... ye shall conquer.
Silence him!
Hearken my prayer, O, Lord!
Men of the cross, attack!
Glory to the King!
Move!
Clear the way.
Push the mantelet forward!
Faster, knights.
Follow me to the bridge.
Hope was left to them, the everlasting peace.
Standby to lower the bridge!
Cast them to the moat!
Which of you has seen the Christian Queen?
Oh, King, we have seen no Christian woman.
She's captive here.
Where is she?
I'll get the truth out of you.
It is the truth.
We know nothing.
Sire, we've searched the palace from tower to vault.
Your lady is not there.
Well, search the houses everywhere!
Yes, sire.
Sire, we have searched and questioned.
No one has seen the Lady Berengaria.
Take what men you need, but find her.
Sire.
Sire, it is the cross.
The true cross.
Sire, I have seen it.
I have seen it.
Sire...
Oh, Alan.
I have seen it.
Have your wounds been looked at?
It matters not.
I have touched the wood of the true cross of our Lord.
It's in there.
It blesses those who touch it.
My boy, you're badly hurt.
I'm dying... but I've touched the cross.
Go, my king.
Lay your hand on it.
Yes, yes, yes.
It is found.
It is there... in eternal light... awaiting you.
All right, son.
We'll go together.
We have found the glory of the worid.
Praise to the Lord of hosts.
Let me touch it.
Let me touch the wood of the cross before I die.
The cross of Christ.
Praise to the Lord, our God.
It is true.
The cross on which he died.
Lo, he is with us always... even unto the end of the worid.
Sire! Sire!
We've word of her!
What?
Here!
Sire! Your lady, we've news of her.
This dog has seen her.
Where? Where is she?
She's gone from Acre with Saladin.
With Saladin!
They went through our lines toward Jerusalem.
Sound the call to arms.
We go on to Jerusalem.
My horse!
You cannot, Richard.
Thousands lie dead outside the walls.
The Count of Hungary...
You heard my orders, Robert.
Sire. Sire.
The cross.
Sire, Saladin has gone to a great army at Jerusalem.
They will outnumber us
10 to 1.
Sound the call.
Sire, it's certain death.
Certain death.
Don't go, sire.
Don't go.
Not half the Crusade lives to follow you.
I ride to Jerusalem.
Let follow me who will.
The King!
Follow the King!
Here is peace by the Holy City of Jerusalem.
I carried you here in my arms... and I prayed to Allah that you would live.
You are kind.
No knight could be more gentle.
Because you have crept into my heart.
Tell me, why did
England's Queen desire to die?
Because I was in the way of my husband.
For his sake?
Yes.
You are no longer the wife of the Lion King.
What do you mean?
Islam does not accept a Christian marriage.
And here is the love of Saladin... who holds you ever in his heart... who worships your loveliness... who would give you all the gifts of the worid... happiness, power... the kings of Asia to kneel at your feet.
That would not bring me happiness.
Words that rise quickly to the lips may not be true.
The truth lies hidden in your heart.
I am your captive.
I do not love you.
Love is not a ring of gold to hold you captive to it.
Love is a flower that blooms at Allah's will.
It is written that you should come to me.
And who can change what is written?
Master.
Yes?
Oh, my master,
Acre has fallen.
The Christians are on the march.
The Lion King rides to Jerusalem.
Richard.
Tomorrow he will be within sight of the Holy City.
Summon the Amirs.
Tomorrow I shall meet the Lion King in battle.
You will never defeat him.
You shall go with me... and from my tent you shall see the foes of Islam... swept like dust before the might of Allah.
God forbid.
Crusaders, charge!
Charge!
Richard, there is nothing here but the dead.
I tell you, old Hercules is slain.
He saved my life today.
It was by that mound.
And I'm going to find his body.
Search tomorrow, sire, when we can see.
Tomorrow?
Tomorrow we may keep him company in heaven or hell.
Tomorrow we fight again.
What's left of us.
Sire, take care.
There are the lights of Saladin's camp.
All right,
I'll go that way.
Sire...
Blondel, you go this way.
But, Richard, I...
Here, give me that torch.
Templar, you stay on that mound... and watch.
What brings
Conrad of Montferrat to me?
I offer you victory.
Tomorrow I shall win it.
The Crusade is broken.
Not yet.
Victory is not sure while
Richard of England lives.
You're his brother's friend.
And would be yours.
What price do you ask for your treachery?
The kingdom of Jerusalem, which I shall rule under you.
And what do you offer me?
Richard's death.
Within the hour, he will lie on the battlefield among the slain.
Who would slay your Lion of the Crusades?
Fifteen swords of mine follow him where he goes alone.
With Richard dead, you will rule unchallenged in Asia.
I have no traffic with assassins.
Away with this dog!
My Lord Sultan, you can save him.
Your Lion King?
Yes.
It is not my hand that will strike him down.
Would you let him die by the swords of traitors?
He is the tempest that has shaken Islam.
My men have died beneath his sword.
But you can tell him, warn him.
If he were here, as you are, my captive... then I would spare him.
For a ransom?
Yes.
Then I will be his ransom.
You, my Princess?
Yes, yes.
Take me to be your wife, but save his life.
Send men to aid him quickly... or quickly warn him before it's too late.
You will open your arms to my love?
Yes, yes, I promise.
Karakush.
Ride to the English King.
He searches among the dead on the battlefield.
Say to him:
"Guard thyself against the soldiers of Montferrat."
Oh, my Sultan... guard thyself against this accursed Christian woman.
Go.
I obey.
Ride swiftly. Swiftly.
Sire.
Hercules!
Old Smithy.
They told me you were dead.
Here, let me.
No, lad.
No, lad. I'm done.
I wanted to tell you,
Richard...
Yes?
I've been... lying here by it, thinking... it's more than a sword
I made for you, lad.
Nothing else... matters...
Steady, steady.
...if you've got this.
The cross.
Old Hercules.
If you...
If you really are there... receive this old man's soul.
Whose men are these?
Conrad of Montferrat's.
But they obey me.
And what message do you bring me now?
Your death.
Strike him down!
Strike him! Kill him!
Look out!
Go at him!
Back, you treacherous dogs!
Pull him down!
How is it that Saracens come to the aid of the English King?
By Allah,
I come not of my own will.
Then who sent you?
The Christian Queen.
Berengaria? Where is she?
In the tent of my master.
Get off, you dog!
Give me that horse!
The tent of your master?
Oh, my master, the King of the Christians.
Let him pass.
Richard.
Lion King, you come unbidden to my tent.
I have come for my wife.
She is my captive.
You were not wise to seek her here.
Now I hold you... as my army holds within its ranks the remnant of your Crusaders...
I have conquered.
If I die here, at least
I'll take you with me... and my men will fill hell with your infidels.
By Allah, I wish you might have been my brother, not my foe.
I offer the Lion what I would offer no other man.
Your Crusade is crushed.
Your kingdom is seized by your brother, John... and other traitors seek your life.
Surrender yourself.
Accept Islam, and I will make you
King of Jerusalem.
I fight for the cross.
No.
You wear the cross... of one who gave his life in this very land... that men might be at peace.
But you have no faith in that cross.
Those who follow me have faith.
In their blood, they crawled to that cross in Acre.
Shall I break faith with them now?
Oh, no, Richard, no.
Not to save my life.
You have chosen your fate.
What ransom will you take for my wife?
Whatever you ask, I grant.
I will take no ransom.
She promised herself to me, and she is mine.
You'll not say that and live!
Richard!
Ho!
Out of my way!
Richard, if it's blood you want,
I'll tear open my wound.
Let my blood flow with yours and all the others.
Oh, my love, they've hurt you.
No, no.
No, Saladin healed me, cared for me.
You owe your own life to him.
To Saladin?
She promised herself to me, to save your life.
I'll not accept my life at that price!
Do you intend to keep your promise?
Yes.
Richard, you must believe...
I've never loved anyone but you.
I love you now.
Don't make me suffer more.
If only we could put an end to pain, if only we could have peace.
If you fight on, thousands and thousands more will die.
Richard, you mustn't.
You know how to yield to a conqueror.
Do you think to teach me?
We've been blind.
We were proud, dearest, when we took the cross... and in our pride, we fought to conquer Jerusalem.
We tried to ride through blood to the Holy Place of God.
And now...
Now we suffer.
The Holy City of Allah.
What if we call him
Allah or God?
Shall men fight because they travel different roads to him?
There is only one God.
His cross is burned deep into our hearts.
It's here... and we must carry it with us wherever we go.
Don't you see, Richard?
There's only one way.
Peace.
Make peace between
Christian and Saracen.
You ask me to lay down my sword?
If you love me.
Sultan...
I offer you peace.
You ask for the truce of Allah?
Truce of Allah or peace of God, yes.
I ask it for the Crusade.
Upon what terms?
The gates of Jerusalem shall be opened... and all Christian captives shall be freed.
All Muslim captives in Acre shall be freed.
Every Christian shall be allowed to enter Jerusalem.
If they bear no arms.
Granted.
They shall come in peace to the tomb... and go in peace.
All but you...
Lion of the Christians, the foe of Islam... you may not enter the gates.
I vowed to go to Jerusalem with my sword.
And I vowed you should never pass the gates of Jerusalem.
I offer terms your sword could never win.
Richard.
Richard, you hold the peace of the worid in your hands.
What does it matter what happens to us... if men can live and the Holy City be freed?
Berengaria, you know what you ask?
Yes.
We've come to our cross, beloved.
We carry our love... and the pain of it deep in our hearts.
Your terms are granted.
It stands between us as man and wife... forever.
I make peace with you.
Let there be peace.
You love him... deeply.
Oh, God...
I was blind.
But now I see.
I know now you really are here.
I've come through blood to your Holy City.
Have pity on the fool that I am.
The Holy Man was right.
Your cross has burned deep into my heart.
I'm no longer king.
I've no pride now... no glory.
I kneel to my God.
Grant me your mercy... and give her back to me.
Have pity on a penitent fool.
Jerusalem is freed!
The war is over.
Freedom! Freedom!
The Crusade! The Crusade is at the gates!
I'm free!
I can see the light.
Open the gates!
There is peace.
Let them open the gates.
Open the gates!
We are free!
Open the gates!
We're free!
There they are!

Richard, beloved... you've conquered.
Look at their faces.
Don't you feel their joy?
I'm glad they're happy, but...
I can't feel anything, except wanting you.
Was there ever such happiness in the worid?
You gave them this.
This that all the hours of Christendom could not give.
See, the gates of Jerusalem are open... and the Crusade is going in.
Now, I can take my gift to the tomb of our Lord.
No, no, don't leave me yet.
Last night,
I asked for you.
You asked?
Whom?
I just begged for you.
You prayed.
We've reached the gates.
I can go no further.
But I shall come back to you,
Richard... when I have laid our gift before our Lord... so that it will no longer stand between us... as man and wife.
But Saladin...
Saladin bade me tell you... all captives shall be freed.
He would not hold me without love.
I'm yours, Richard.
Oh, merciful God.

THE PEARLS OF THE CROWN
With the obligatory details
out of the way, here are...
THE PEARLS OF THE CROWN
SEE AND HEAR...
THE AMAZING STORY
OF SEVEN FINE PEARLS
RESEARCHED, WRITTEN,
AND OFTEN JUST DREAMED UP...
BY SACHA GUITRY
Oh, this is amazing, and unbelievable, like all true stories.
What is it?
I just came across a fabulous unknown story that would make a fascinating book, play or film.
Almost out of the
Thousand and One Nights.
Let me make one note and I'm all yours.
Your Holiness will be pleased to learn the exact provenance of the four magnificent pearls that adorn the crown of England.
Do you know how the crown of England was made?
That's one thing I don't know.
Good.
I'll take great pleasure in telling you the exact origins of the four pearls that adorn the crown's arches.
Settle back, close your eyes, listen, and imagine the pictures to illustrate my true story.
One evening in February 1518...
One evening in February 1518,
King Fran? ois I of France was telling Lorenzo de' Medici at Fontainebleau...
I say your melancholy has but one cause: solitude.
You revel in it, but it's harmful to your feeble health.
You've given me marvelous gifts: vases from Orbino, and glass and lace from Venice.
Allow me today to repay you.
Accept from my hands a treasure comparable to the splendors you've given me.
Twenty years old, the most beautiful eyes, a delicate soul, a charming heart, and adorable hands.
Don't turn around.
Here she is.
Her name is
Madeleine de la Tour d'Auvergne.
What's more, she's my cousin.
What do you think?
Doesn't she need a Florentine setting?
What say you?
She's beautiful, cousin.
Their union gave birth, ten months later in Florence, to Caterina de' Medici.
That's right, my dear.
Yes, Your Holiness.
It's a little girl, Duchess.
The same day in Fontainebleau,
Henri, dauphin of France, was born.
It's a boy!
Those two infants
would one day wed.
Caterina's birth took the life
of Madeleine de la Tour d'Auvergne,
closing her charming eyes
forever.
I hail and welcome you, young prince of France.
As the king of France greeted
his precious offspring,
Caterina met with a far cooler
reception from her father.
But we mustn't blame him,
for Lorenzo was at death's door
when his daughter was
presented to him.
Deceased even before
he could learn
of his wife's death,
he was no doubt pleasantly
surprised to encounter her
upon arriving in the Beyond.
Thus orphaned at birth,
Caterina was given to her uncle,
Pope Clement Vll,
who ordered her raised
in a convent.
Marvelous creature!
Divine splendor!
An angel sent from heaven to us here on earth.
See that she's raised in a convent.
If God in his divine grace is willing, she'll spend her entire life there.
Three renowned artists were then
painting masterpieces
and immortalizing
two powerful monarchs.
Jean Clouet began
his portrait of Fran? ois I
as Hans Holbein was finishing his
of Henry Vlll of England.
In Venice,
Titian was working
on another portrait of Fran? ois I,
which we find to be
a better likeness,
though he painted
this magnificent work
under surprising conditions.
Clouet, do you know how my cousin Henry VIII's legs look?
No, Your Majesty.
He claims they're seemlier than mine, which I doubt, though he is a handsome man.
This seemingly minor issue is behind a rivalry that's obstructed a difficult but desirable alliance between England and France.
Are you working, Clouet?
- Yes, sire.
You seem to be motionless at your easel.
Motionless, sire?
If only Your Majesty were more so,
I would be much less so.
- Are you jealous of Titian?
- Titian?
- He's painting me in Venice.
- Venice?
I sent a medallion of myself
and my richest apparel
with the cardinal of Lorraine,
who is to tell him
the exact tint of my eyes.
Is that you, my son?
Come here.
Come sit on my lap.
How old are you now?
I'll soon be eight, Father.
Eight already!
It's high time you wed.
If you married
Henry Vlll's daughter,
it might soften
those Angles'hard angles.
But a more appealing plan comes to mind.
I'll give you in marriage to Clement VII's niece,
Caterina de' Medici.
You were born the same day.
She's being raised in a convent,
and I'm sure she has
her lovely mother's
sweet disposition.
Clouet, kindly do a quick sketch of the dauphin to send to the pope to show what a fine husband he'd be for Caterina.
Take my seat, young man.
Show him your profile.
Don't move, and don't make faces.
Clouet, do a miniature, medallion-size.
I did a poor job on his chin.
You have greater talent.
Make it less receding... as you see fit.
"If Your Holiness will allow me, on behalf of the dauphin of France,
I ask you..."
"...for Caterina's hand in marriage.
I see in their union a guarantee of lasting peace and happiness.
Your most pious son,
Fran? ois."
Thank You, Almighty, for the joy you've brought me.
Quick, get me two men who are trustworthy, discreet and brave.
My nephew Hippolytus, and that friend of his, the young Spanelli.
Yes, Your Holiness.
The dauphin is charming.
What a faultless profile!
Such an exquisitely shaped chin!
You are both to leave at once.
Go to the convent at Le Murate and bring Caterina back to me here.
A letter from His Holiness for Mother Superior.
Mother!
A letter from His Holiness!
Quick, let them in.
Caterina!
Farewell, Caterina.
This is... absolutely true.
Come.
Caterina de' Medici, you may one day be a queen.
I can say no more.
But as of today
I take you under my protection.
I want you to become the most educated and cultured princess in Europe.
Teach her French, and, above all, English.
Because to rule France well, she must know English well.
Not thow ast.
No, I'll say thow!
No, I'll say thow!
No one can give me orders!
It's vexing to be the father of such a fool.
I appreciate a rebellious spirit and a prince who can't bear another's authority.
But to pronounce English in your own way is a sign of stupidity.
Get to work!
And as for you... -
What's your name, miss?
Anne de Boleyn, Your Majesty.
You're very pretty.
You would rebel before such eyes?
You would argue with a face like that?
You should blush with shame.
Out, young man!
You are not my son.
Go pray to Our Lord and seek his pardon before mine.
Go!
I'd like to atone for his faults and foolishness.
How do you pronounce that word?
How?
Very good.
De Boleyn's not very English.
But I am indeed the Duke of Norfolk's granddaughter.
You've been here at court for?
Almost three months.
I'm a maid of honor to the queen.
I too would like to learn English.
Since I need an instructor, will you be the one?
Alas, I'm leaving Paris tomorrow.
- Leaving?
- For England.
The king's asked me to be a maid of honor to the queen.
I should have been there two weeks ago.
So you're leaving now.
What a pity.
Rest your chin on your hand.
Come forward. More.
Further.
Part your lips.
Close your eyes.
Did you like that?
Did you hate it?
What if I say I liked it?
I'd say I have others even more tender.
And if I didn't like it?
As punishment for forcing it on you,
I'd ask you to give it back.
Caterina? Good day.
- Caterina, what's my name?
- Hippolytus.
I hereby declare you a cardinal.
Go!
A cardinal?
Yes, at 18 years old.
He thought that would keep
Caterina out of danger?
No, but it would at least keep them from marrying.
- Did he make the other one a bishop?
- No.
To get rid of him, he said...
I need you for an extremely important mission.
If you succeed, your every desire will be granted... and more.
And I think
I know what they are.
Here are two fine pearls.
I want five others exactly identical in weight, shape and color.
Search the world over, if need be.
Bring them to me, and I guarantee you'll be the happiest of men.
See that he's given
1,000 gold pieces.
He's to leave at once.
Go now and return quickly.
I give you my blessing.
In giving him those pearls
and sending him off to search
the world for five identical ones,
the pope surely thought
he was rid of Spanelli forever.
Meanwhile, things in England were
about to grow more complicated.
She finally decided to appear.
He scolded her for her delay
for an entire hour,
she who was
to become his mistress,
then his wife,
and soon after, his victim.
Then he interrogated her.
Where had she been?
France.
Doing what?
But upon hearing
she'd been at court,
and that the king had looked
especially kindly upon her,
his own attitude changed.
Attractive and pretty,
this merchant's daughter
seemed worthy of a king.
But a man entered who looked
askance at their long kiss:
Cardinal Wolsey.
Having presented her to his privy
councilor, he took her to the queen.
For it's an odd habit
husbands have
of making their wives evaluate
their mistresses-to-be.
For Henry VIII to take a mistress is natural.
I'd be in bad standing... -
You're standing badly.
I'd be in bad standing to criticize.
But asking Rome to annul his marriage amazes me, for I was sure he loved her.
What if he marries her?
Then he certainly doesn't love her.
Marrying one's mistress means getting her out of the way.
It's a way of winning back one's freedom, for the mistress's position thus becomes vacant.
Do you know what the king of England dares ask?
That I annul his marriage to the queen so he can marry a merchant's daughter named Anne Boleyn!
This is an outrage!
I'll never annul it, you hear?
Never!
Never!
Here's Montmorency, his brow dark with worry, his hands full of bad news.
Not now.
Life's too beautiful today.
Not a word.
I'm sure everything's amiss.
How could it be otherwise?
Impossible.
Madam, is your king a target?
That funereal face annoys me greatly, because it's contagious.
Frowns and gloomy looks are never good omens.
You're sad and prudish.
You always foresee war or famine.
Sire, foresight is a virtue.
Yes, but I fear it's not very French.
The people are miserable.
Don't tell them that.
You want to make them happy?
- If I can.
Who wouldn't?
My friend, you promise them happiness here on earth... - a serious mistake.
The ways of religion are much wiser than yours.
Instead of offering happiness in this life, they prudently promise it for the next one.
If one spends money freely, flings it out the window, it may fall into the hands of the poor.
Indeed, scandal may shake Britain like a tree in the wind, bending it from right to left and back, but the more it's blown one way, the quicker it bends back the other.
But lose its balance? Never!
Never!
But France is not a tree.
Like this ball, it's light and capricious, flying from your hand just when you think you grasp it firmly.
But fear not when it hits the ground, for it always bounces back.
Henry VIII even spoke of reforming the church.
So loudly did he protest against the pope's obstinacy that... -
- He became a Protestant.
- Exactly.
See what thwarted love can lead to?
What about Spanelli?
He'd journeyed all the way to the Persian Gulf,
where he found
the first of the pearls he sought.
It was in a black diver's mouth,
a pearl amid 32 other
white pearls.
It's exactly like the others.
It's splendid!
But I need three more.
Where will I find them?
Then our traveler came to a faraway land, untamed yet refined... - Abyssinia.
No, not this book.
I always confuse them.
Abyssinia.
Its cruel queen claimed to be
a direct descendant
of the queen of Sheba.
Spanelli was struck
by her beauty,
but he was astounded
when he noticed her earrings... -
two magnificent,
pear-shaped pearls.
He couldn't help but react.
Seeing his gesture,
the queen grew worried.
No, I only speak Italian.
What's going on here?
I believe I understand.
You're Italian, and you speak French.
I'm French, and I understand English.
He's English, and he understands Abyssinian.
We'll join forces to help the queen understand.
Why did he make this gesture?
Because her two eyes are like stars.
Because he says the lady has eyes like stars.
Without the presence
of that useless snake,
Spanelli would've been
the happiest of men that day.
At sunrise, the queen
felt a deep gratitude toward him.
She seemed a bit surprised
at his insistence,
but she realized it was best
not to make
an enemy of an Italian.
Holy Virgin, have pity on this wandering traveler.
Take pity on this lover who implores you.
Holy Virgin, my last hope.
Guide my steps and lead me to the pearl I still need.
- Hippolytus!
- Spanelli!
- How happy I am to see you.
- How was your trip?
Marvelous.
I have the five pearls.
How's Caterina?
- Alas...
- What's happened?
Poor Spanelli.
Cruel disappointment awaited him.
He'd left a child
but returned to find a young girl
whose feelings had matured
just as her features had.
Her choice was made.
They're beautiful.
Thank you.
You've fulfilled to the utmost the mission I sent you on.
Go now and rest.
Poor Spanelli.
His journey has made him very weary.
Does Your Holiness think he needs... a long rest?
A long rest.
A very long rest.
No, boys aren't as charmingly precocious as girls.
At 14, girls are already women possessed of understanding and intuition.
You certainly don't look like one betrothed.
Hold yourself more nobly, my son.
My dear child...
I'm giving you the loveliest pearl necklace in the entire world.
For me?
It's so beautiful!
I want their meeting at the port in Marseille to be held in exceptional pomp and splendor.
Since His Holiness is escorting Caterina,
I myself will accompany the dauphin.
Two years later,
those two had a son
who would become
king of France... - Fran? ois II.
The sickly infant had no idea
his wife-to-be had just been born
in Scotland,
and this smiling little girl
couldn't know
that she was Mary Stuart,
who was to become queen of France,
yet that's what happened
six years later.
After repudiating the queen
and dismissing Wolsey,
Henry Vlll wed Anne Boleyn
and immediately
became very enamored
of Jane Seymour.
From that moment on,
Anne Boleyn's days
were numbered.
This royal joke
brought no smile to her lips.
A few years later
the king died,
and soon after, the king of France
delivered his soul to God.
More.
Henri II succeeded his brother,
but it was often Catherine
who fulfilled his royal duties.
Years passed.
Mary Tudor succeeded
her father, Henry Vlll.
Five years later,
Elizabeth succeeded her.
And Pope Clement Vll's
lights slowly dimmed.
But then they beamed again.
But then...
they faded once more...
before brightening again
one last time...
and then going out completely...
and dying.
Paul III succeeded him.
Henry II died suddenly.
Fran? ois II took his place,
and Mary Stuart
became queen of France.
My child...
I want you to have this necklace of seven pearls my uncle gave me on my wedding day.
Henceforth,
I wish the arms of England emblazoned with the arms of France.
I shall thus assert my formal claim to the crown of England.
That's dangerous!
When Queen Elizabeth hears of it...
Indeed, on hearing this,
Queen Elizabeth was enraged.
But Fran? ois II
grew weaker by the day,
and his brother's shadow
loomed ever larger.
Catherine would find
consolation in her own way.
Fran? ois II soon died,
and his brother Charles IX
succeeded him.
Mary was in white mourning
for 40 days.
Lord, have pity on me.
The Queen Mother hates me.
Queen Elizabeth wishes me dead.
I'm a widow and an orphan, and I'm not even 20.
Lord, come to my aid.
Send her away.
I can't bear the sight of her!
Send her away.
She's queen of Scotland.
Let her go home, back to her throne.
It's dangerous for her.
What do I care?
I want her to be gone.
If she needs money, give it to her.
A little.
No, don't give her any.
Let her keep the pearl necklace she wears.
But Your Majesty, you gave it to me.
No, my dear,
I placed it in your hands.
Today I'm giving it to you.
Let's not judge an incident that was so... deplorable.
Let's simply recognize that after a hasty trial, poor Mary Stuart was sentenced to be beheaded.
I ask for her help and place my fate in her hands, and she locks me in this gloomy castle.
Queen Elizabeth is too good to me.
I'm afraid.
Let it be known, recounted, and written down what the last hours of my life were like.
Take this.
Please accept this.
Tell them I had my gloves dyed red so the blood would not show on my white hands.
Has the hour come?
Do not cry.
Come.
Don't leave me alone.
Only four pearls out of seven
were recovered from the thieves.
The gang leader
had fled with the other three.
Queen Elizabeth
took the four famous pearls
and hid them in a secret panel
in a small box.
Three hundred years later,
Queen Victoria accidentally
discovered the secret panel
and found the four pearls.
She sent for the royal crown
and had the four pearls set
on the crown's arches,
where all can see them today.
Well, what do you think of that story?
Fascinating!
I even see myself in poor Mary Stuart's role.
And I see myself as Fran? ois I, of course.
We always lend our faces to the heroes of the story.
And why not?
Listen, I want to know what happened to the other three pearls.
- That the thief fled with?
- Of course.
The other three, Your Holiness?
It'd be interesting to know what became of them.
If Your Holiness insists...
You think I should try?
Of course.
I'm very interested.
I'd love to.
I'm on my way.
I know what I must do.
I'm off. I have an idea.
NOW HERE IS THE TALE
OF THE THREE PEARLS
TAKEN BY THE THIEF
WHO FLED.
Excuse me, Constable.
I'd like to ask you something.
Where is this?
How silly of me! Thank you.
Nice boys.
It's in English, of course.
In this country they have the deplorable custom of using a language I don't know.
Nevertheless,
I see a date and some numbers that look somehow familiar.
Look at that.
- Are you Italian?
- Yes, sir.
Then you speak three languages?
I speak seven, sir.
Congratulations!
You'd like to know what that says?
Yes, I see a date and some figures that intrigue me.
It says that at this very table, in 1587, three thieves divided up a necklace of seven magnificent pearls.
"One thief kept three and divided four between his two accomplices."
Exactly.
You've done me a great favor.
I'm a very happy man.
Me too.
For the same reason?
I believe so.
I don't think this gentleman is disappointed either.
Could we all be here for the same reason?
I suspect so.
Then let's introduce ourselves.
Jean Martin, French author.
Giovanni Riboldi, chamberlain to the pope.
Are you hunting for the three pearls missing from the English crown?
Then allow me.
Let's sit here as those three did in 1587.
That may be, but I didn't understand him.
But I say fate's brought us together, so let's not mislead each other.
That's what he just said.
Good. Let's share... -
Please tell him this:
Let's share everything we discover.
Instead of hunting for the same pearl, we'll split up.
I suggest we all meet here in two weeks, on April 30th, at 3:00, to see where we stand.
Ask him what he thinks.
I understand French.
Perfect!
- Right here.
- At 3:00.
- Hello.
- Well?
I found one.
No, not really.
But I know where it was two weeks ago.
But today? Who knows?
It belonged to a certain Fleury Genneval, but the sly old fox won't say what she did with it.
When I think of all I've done in 12 days.
I traced its entire path since 1587, and now it eludes me at the very last minute... - how irritating!
But surely all isn't lost.
When are you to see your two colleagues?
In three days, at that tavern in London I told you about.
I found out a jeweler has the pearl, so I visited every jeweler in Paris, but in vain.
Any word from your mother?
- Good news. She'll be back tonight.
You see?
Bad news travels in pairs.
Oh, sweetheart!
Actually I'm off tomorrow to Amsterdam to pursue a lead, then to London on the 29th.
Call me at lunch every day at the restaurant I always go to.
Oh, I'd give anything for that pearl!
- If only I could help.
- I'm sure you will.
I swear, if I find it,
I'll make a film about it.
What's that?
Yes, I'm Mr. Martin.
Is that you, darling?
I think I found it.
- What?
- The pearl.
You're crazy!
I'm not.
It's in the morning paper.
It said there's an auction.
Let me find it.
"An auction of jewels belonging to Madame Fleury Genneval..."
Isn't that the name you mentioned?
"...including a pear-shaped pearl weighing 192 grains."
That must be it!
It goes on to say
"...of historical value."
They always say that,
but for once it's true.
Listen, go to that auction and see who buys it.
Phone me with details immediately afterward.
I'll grab the next flight.
Of course, if a foreigner buys it,
I must know where he's headed.
When's the auction?
At 2:00 sharp.
It's now 1:40.
I'm off. Bye, darling.
Bye, sweetheart.
Ladies and gentlemen, we'll begin the auction.
Payment must be made on the spot and include 14.5 % of the bid.
We'll begin with item No. 5 in the catalog: a pear-shaped pearl weighing 192 grains.
This pearl is unique, of inestimable value.
Nevertheless, we've estimated it at 200,000 francs.
We'll begin at 50,000.
50,000 francs.
It was given to me in 1903 by a grand duke over supper at Maxim's.
- 100,000 on my right!
- 110,000 in the first row!
I'm sure he'll give me a magnificent present.
From what he said this morning, it'll be either a ring or a bracelet.
I'd prefer cash, but in the end it's the same thing.
After three months together, circumstances call him back to America, forcing us to separate.
But I'm blameless, meaning he doesn't know you exist.
So in that case,
I'd say the present will cost...
...around 100,000 francs.
And I think I'm worth it.
- Some port?
- Yes, darling.
210,000 in the first row!
210,000! Do I hear more?
210,000 going once.
250,000 in the rear!
Going... going... gone!
Will you be keeping it?
I'll take it with me.
- How will you be paying?
- By check.
- When does the Normandie sail?
- Tomorrow morning.
But he prefers to stay in Le Havre tonight.
- I'm glad.
- So am I.
Shouldn't I go, all the same?
Stay just 15 minutes more.
It's 2:30.
I love you.
Oh, miserable man!
- He left.
- With my gift.
He took advantage of me, the bastard!
The ingratitude!
And to top it all, they expect us to love them.
My God, how stupid can a man be!
What'll I do with this pearl?
We'll see.
Good news... -
I know who bought it.
A nice gentleman from the south has it on him.
Doesn't seem to know what to do with it.
I'll explain why later.
I'm spending the night in Le Havre.
My room's next to his.
Because he sails on the Normandie tomorrow.
I couldn't call any earlier!
I haven't left his trail for a second.
What should I do?
Take the Normandie?
You're joking!
What about you?
That's right.
It calls at Southampton. All right.
Wait, darling.
What if he speaks to me after running into me everywhere?
You're so silly!
So I'm to speak to him in adverbs only?
Very well.
See you tomorrow, darling.
Well, I'll be!
Pardon me.
You're a lovely woman.
Careful.
I'm only allowed to use adverbs.
Are you French?
Certainly.
Me too.
Does it show?
- Positively.
I'm from Marseille.
Obviously.
If I woo you, you'll react?
Stoically.
I've seen you eight times in two days.
Similarly.
You find that normal?
Perfectly.
Going to New York?
What?
Are you going to New York?
Probably.
Are you alone?
Heroically.
You're quite young.
Sufficiently.
A ravishing lady's kiss would set me back?
Enormously.
And one kiss from you would set me back?
Inestimably.
How do you live?
Conjugally.
So you're saving your kisses for?
My lover-ly.
What about your husband?
He is my lover-ly.
- Hello! How are you?
- Fine! You?
Wonderful!
Good to see you again.
Shall we wait for our third thief?
- It's only polite.
- Here he is.
- What?
- He found the first pearl.
- I found the second.
- I found the third.
We did it!
What is it?
I hope they're not all the same one.
He gave mine to an English girl for her "favors."
Then we did it!
We found the three pearls!
The thief lost his at gambling, but he tried to sell mine.
But something stopped him?
What?
- He died first.
- Tell us the story.
- Why me first?
- He and I already know our stories.
Very well. I give in.
- So he tried to sell it?
- But it was too risky in England.
Besides, he felt only a king could afford such a pearl.
But how was he to approach a king?
Then he recalled that Henri IV, your famous ladies' man, was then in Dieppe, recruiting all willing men for his army, whether from England, or Switzerland, or anywhere else.
So he crossed the Channel.
And our new recruits?
Sire, 942 volunteers just arrived from England.
I'll inspect them shortly.
We'll fight tomorrow, before your very eyes.
- How many men does Mayenne have?
- I don't know.
But an army's valor isn't measured by the number of its men.
You're beautiful... exquisite... adorable... charming.
Give me a smile, darling.
Take my hand and come see the Englishmen who'll be dead by tomorrow.
Have no fear, my beloved.
- What did that man want?
- I don't know.
His look frightened me.
I'm still trembling.
- He tried to address the king.
- He mustn't do that again.
Hail the victor, and reward him with your most ardent kiss.
- A decisive victory?
- Resounding.
Yet my joy is soured by remorse.
I begin to weary of an enterprise that leaves so many dead and wounded.
Poor friend! Come to me!
The man who tried to speak to you.
He's in horrible pain.
He threw himself into my arms.
No, leave him with me.
You may go.
He's looking for something.
What is it?
A pearl?
- He's giving it to you.
- Why?
He wants to speak.
He's dying. Look away.
Poor man. It's all over.
- Maybe he has papers on him.
- I hope so.
No, nothing.
I give this to you.
But never give it away, and never sell it.
Whatever its origins, it is now sacred, for this man died fighting for us.
Bury him nearby.
On his tombstone, engrave but these few words:
"An English soldier who died for France in the arms of Henri IV."
Now do you see... why I grow weary of battle?
That's why he was unable to sell it.
What happened to it?
You can't stop there!
For almost two centuries, never leaving the court, it followed an amazing zigzag course, finally reaching
Madame du Barry.
The king gave it to me as a New Year's gift.
Henri IV had given it to his mistress.
Gabrielle died, bequeathing it to the queen.
Since then it's been passed from one woman to another, from the hands of queens to our own, a reward sometimes for love, sometimes for virtue.
Three queens have worn it.
Five mistresses have owned it.
It's lovely.
- Splendid.
- Unique.
- Zamor wants to see it too.
- Whatever for?
- He's so ugly.
- And so dark.
- He's amusing.
- Less than you think.
Sit up pretty.
As a reward, you may lick my fingertips.
He adores me.
It's true.
I think you're mistaken.
I'd bet my life on it.
So would I.
- You hear that singing?
- It's awful!
The wisest thing is to bury them at the foot of a tree.
I don't think anyone's seen us.
Come quickly!
Madam Véto had promised me
She'd slit the throats of all Paree
But she failed and caused no fears
Thanks to our cannoneers
Dance the carmagnole
Harken to its sound
Dance the carmagnole
as our guns resound
It's not true!
Someone lied to you!
Why arrest me?
I've done nothing wrong!
It was you, Zamor?
You betrayed me?
You may lick my fingertips.
Did you see Du Barry guillotined?
No, sadly, I wasn't in Paris.
She was beautiful.
What a head!
It was as if they cut off the body, not the head.
Yes, he's like Puss in Boots.
He's pitiful and laughable at the same time, with the oddest look in his eyes.
Barras... will you introduce me?
- Yes, at once.
General Bonaparte,
Joséphine de Beauharnais.
Why do you mock me?
- Mock you?
- Cruelly.
From afar, with your laughter and smiles and stifled cries devoid of meaning.
To me you're the most beautiful, most alluring woman here tonight.
I've poured out my soul to you from afar.
You've read it in my eyes.
Yet you laugh at this general who's just 27.
You laugh at my hair, my slight frame, my miserable uniform.
You should blush with shame.
You're mean... yet so lovely.
Who's that?
We call her
"Our Lady of Thermidor."
- Meaning?
- Madame Tallien.
Barras's mistress?
If he didn't brag so about it,
I'd be sure.
I don't care about that one, but speak to Madame de Beauharnais tonight and you won't see me for two weeks.
I adore you.
- Marry her off.
- That's my dream.
For she's an "em-barras-ment" to this Barras.
Barras.
You allow a lieutenant general to be dressed like this?
Am I to have but 30 francs in my pocket?
Beautiful, isn't she?
Who?
Countess de Beauharnais.
- She's charming.
- No, she's beautiful.
You have every reason to be in love.
Deliver 40,000 francs to General Bonaparte tomorrow.
- That's too much.
- No, it's fine.
Buy her jewels.
She loves them.
In two days you'll be in command of the army in Italy.
You'll leave on the 5th.
Marry her on the 4th.
32,000 is very expensive.
Look at it, General.
It's unique.
Know who that is?
Bonaparte.
No! You sure?
Positive.
General, I'll let you have it for 30,000 francs, but only because it's you.
- It's 10:00 p.m.
- Yes, it is.
- He's an hour late.
- Yes, he is.
Getting married at this hour!
He leaves tomorrow.
It was a last-minute decision.
Perhaps he forgot.
The mayor's fallen asleep.
No regrets?
No, not yet, but the future looks dim.
You're wrong.
Why aren't you marrying me?
Meanie!
- Here he is.
- Forgive me.
Come along.
Marry us quickly!
Sorry I'm late.
I had to prepare for my journey.
I adore you.
Napoléon Bonaparte...
- This is it.
...born in Ajaccio on August 15th, 1767.
You added two years to your age?
To make you appear even younger.
Do you take as your husband
General...
I love you.
The visit to Malmaison, the memory of poor Joséphine, and the reminders of my youth had already broken my heart.
I wanted to see
Fontainebleau one last time, but I shouldn't have done it.
Why didn't they let me die?
The poison I took was already taking effect.
Deserted, betrayed, vanquished... - life is horrible!
Her Majesty Queen Hortense.
Why have you come?
After giving you
Mother's diamonds earlier,
In my jewel box I found this pearl that the empress was so fond of.
Take it.
It's very valuable.
You may need it one day.
It's yours.
Give it to your son on his wedding day.
He still has that glum look.
You may reign one day.
Should I foster such a hope?
Is he intelligent?
I don't know.
Whether my son reigns or not,
I don't want Louis to be Napoléon II.
No, never.
The third!
I was born in Granada, but I spent holidays at my uncle's in Arteaga.
Every morning I'd kneel in the cathedral before that jewel-studded virgin who's worked many miracles.
If one day I wished to make a vow...
I'd surely go there.
The emperor!
She's so beautiful.
On June 17th, 1815, on this very spot, the emperor bid farewell to my mother.
I was here.
I can still see myself.
He asked
Queen Hortense about me.
He was anxious to know if I was intelligent or not.
He shouldn't broach that topic.
People will always ask that about me.
It will never be resolved.
In any case, he asked my mother to one day give me this pearl that had belonged to Empress Joséphine.
Today, June 17th, 1865,
50 years later, since we are among friends, allow me to offer it to the empress.
I've come to pray for those fighting to save France.
I wish to add this pearl to the Virgin's treasures.
Good-bye, Father.
God be with you,
Your Majesty.
What pearl, sir?
On the Virgin's forehead?
In 1914, a very old lady asked me to add it to the Virgin's treasures so she would take pity on those fighting for France.
And that lady was?
Empress Eugénie, sir.
Thank you, Father.
And that's the story of the third pearl.
Now hear the tale
of the first pearl,
the one the thief lost
at gambling.
Ah, I understand.
She gave it to her granddaughter
for her engagement,
saying the pearl
should never leave their family.
The old woman of our day has only a son.
She gave it to him begrudgingly.
The pearl was false.
I understand English now.
- He said that in French.
- Ah, that's why!
It must be one of the two from the queen of Ethiopia.
Probably.
Your turn now.
Yes, my turn.
This pearl seems to have come into this world only to help secure the amorous favors of the ladies.
Fifty years later,
old and poor,
she sold it to an old lord,
who had a place for it
right beside him.
Money provides three types of joy: acquiring it, having it, and spending it.
I prefer spending it.
For you, my sweet little Frenchie.
What's your name?
I'm Sorel's great-great-great-granddaughter.
Agnès Sorel.
I love you too, you distinguished old Englishman.
Kiss me.
Again.
Good Lord, they're demanding!
Don't be cruel, my mean little lass.
Years later, that same woman,
now of some stature,
learned gratitude to men.
You're a handsome young Hungarian.
Yes, I'm rather pleased with myself.
And since I'm pleased with you as well...
I have a present for you.
Good idea.
I should get two kisses for this pearl.
Two kisses are a lot.
Ah, turnabout is fair play.
Should I repent for having been cruel?
What I said in the past don't you say now.
No, don't say I'm demanding.
I said those words too often.
Find something else, something better.
Make me suffer, if you wish... if you can!
Truly, I deserve it more than any woman.
Be brutal... cowardly... vile... despicable.
Be not sparing with your cruelty if you wish me to suffer almost as much as I, for 200 years, made other men suffer.
Sixty years later,
the 90-year-old Hungarian,
with roles reversed once again,
waves the pearl
with trembling fingers
at the lyric soprano
whose favors he buys.
Those piercing high notes
are called "sweetheart notes"... -
pure coincidence.
In any case, this old,
none-too-bashful gentleman
pays dearly for each note.
With age, sopranos lose their voices,
as she did hers.
One winter night
she sold the magnificent pearl
to a gentleman
whose singular tastes
might seem perverted.
Yes, my sweet negress, your profile isn't Greek.
But Helen's beauty isn't what I seek.
Your beauty makes my head spin.
For the satin luster of your ebony skin will bring this pearl's whiteness to its peak.
Sixty-two years later,
the old woman,
ailing and miserable,
sold the pearl
to Don Pedro Jiménez.
That same night,
Don Pedro gave it to a ballerina,
whose eyes, legs,
and breasts he loved.
Old in her turn,
one night at Maxim's,
she sold it to a grand duke
at the next table.
Sic transit gloria mundi.
The new owner
parted with it 32 years later.
Life is cruel at times.
To avoid poverty, she sold it yesterday at an auction.
And then?
Would you like to see the pearl?
See it?
Yes, see it and hold it.
Would you like to touch it?
Of course!
Then come to dinner tonight on the Normandie at Southampton.
What do you say?
Of course.
Come in.
Who are they from?
- I don't know.
But I think it was a man.
Probably.
When do we reach Southampton?
- In three minutes.
- Thank you.
Oh, I can't take any credit.
Some arguments are decisive.
Hypothetically.
Hello, darling.
This is John Russell,
His Majesty's equerry.
Giovanni Riboldi, the pope's chamberlain.
Well?
Come along.
- Where is he?
- I don't see him yet.
There, right behind you.
The man sitting alone?
He looks furious.
Because we came along?
I have no idea.
Has he spoken to you?
Yes, he made some vague compliments.
Are these from him?
I found them in my cabin with no card.
I'm sure it was him.
Congratulations.
Your boyfriend doesn't even have a tuxedo.
- You mustn't stare.
- Oh really!
The man speaks to my wife and sends her flowers, and I'm to say nothing?
Be logical.
You told me to follow him.
He saw me at the auction, on the train, at Le Havre, and here.
He wondered if I was following him and finally asked.
I'm in an awkward situation, and it's your fault.
We'll discuss that later.
Gentlemen, please excuse my reaction.
I think it's quite natural.
What's our choice of poison here?
- What?
- There's something on my plate.
See what it is.
The pearl!
By God!
He's gone. Good riddance.
I don't want a private matter to spoil our excitement.
Hand me that pearl.
Gentlemen, here's the marvelous pearl.
I said you'd see it tonight.
I kept my promise.
Magnificent.
Marvelous.
Please put it on.
I'm not saying you'll wear it for long, but put it on for a moment.
Getting off at Southampton, sir?
Yes, I am.
I don't want any trouble with that man.
You're not going on to New York?
I'll take the next ship.
That'll teach me.
Women!
How would you know?
I was one once.
I'll curse all women until the day I finally meet one who makes me forget the harm the rest have done me.
Inexorably.
What's with all the adverbs on this ship?
Get my bag.
Luckily I trust you, because it's unthinkable for a man to just send a woman a pearl worth 250,000 francs.
Let me have that pearl.
I'll give it back to the gentleman and clout him a good one at the same time.
Don't think I won't!
Gentlemen, we must say farewell to this pearl.
You're returning it to him?
Of course.
What did he say?
It's of historic value.
Do you have the right to dispose of it... -
Do I have the right?
I must say I agree with him.
Yes, it's the sole survivor of the three lost pearls.
Yes, it's true.
It belonged to Pope Clement VII,
Catherine de Médicis... and the queen of Scotland.
It should end up...
- In Rome.
- In England.
Or in the Louvre, in which case... -
My God!
The die is cast.
Fate has decided that
that marvelous wandering pearl
should return
from whence it came.
It's me miss McGregor.
Joe Elliott
Come in.
Well, what is it? -Amy wanted I should come over to tell you she can't do the clothes this week. She stove up with cold.
And she sent you ten miles just to tell me the that.
You know Amy. Once she's got something to say she's gonna say it now.
Besides it only took about two hours the way I came
Good night.
- Good night, Joe.
Kelly to take a hot lemonade and sweat it out.
I will, thank you.
Good night. -Good night. that lies to my breasts at one cherishing word that lols is one big
Xander dreaming of light and Canberra she's very light oh look he's hiding
Dominick's is holy like going to the theater for nothing what do you say folks if we organize the quartet right here
Mr. calhoune will be the baritone, I'll carry the lead,
Tom will be the tenor all we need is bass. how about you went through why he couldn't carry a tune in a bucket perhaps our new boarder Mr. Bell might do.
Who, the professor?
- Our young genius.
Bells all right just different. but do you suppose he really believes he can teach that deaf and dumb child he brought here to talk,
All I can say is if the Lord intended dumb people to talk, he'd have taken care of it. oh excuse me
- oh come in Mr. Bell. miss McGregor do you have any copper wire in the house? a big picture wire I'll do. copper wire? - yes I I need about
17 feet for one of my experiments and all the shops are closed at this hour. why the idea of expecting to find 17 feet of wire at this time of night well I never heard of such a thing Mr. Bell. well I'm sorry if I bothered you. Good night.
Just a moment, professor. don't figure an impertinence and we've just been wondering if it's true you can teach dumb people to talk.
I hope to someday. you see mr. Darcy the reason deaf mutes can't speak is that they have bad ears and not not bad vocal cords. never having heard speech they can't imitate it. so if we can find a way to to visualize sound for them and there's no reason why they shouldn't speak as well as any one of us.
Isn't it?
- No, I guess not. no of course not would you stay and show us some of your tricks Mr. Bell?
Tricks? - yes it would be such fun.
I've heard you make the piano play by just talking to it oh well I'll be glad to but they're they're not tricks. please. they're very simple manifestations of the of the nature of sound and of vibrations in the air. now first I push down the sustaining pedal then I depress the key do... do... re... me... fa... sol... - Mart's positively spooky.
- oh no no not at all mrs. McGregor sound is nothing but air in motion when I sing the scales I set up certain vibrations which fall on the strings of the piano just as they fall on the membranes of our ears thus producing corresponding vibrations or sounds
Is that clear?
- No.
Mr. Bell the little boy's father's here to see you with another gentleman.
Mr. Sanders. thank you. excuse me please.
Mr. Bell that's a dandy act I bet you could do something with that.
Thank you Mr. Darcy.
I expect to.
And alali. -Hello, mr. Sanders.
- How is he? just fine.
I want you to meet my friend
Mr. Gardner Hubbarda. Alexander Grehem Bell.
Mr. Hubbard of course I know you by my reputation your your interest in the Clark School for the deaf.
I've been hearing about you too and your work with Sanders boy. would you like to go out and see George?
That's way we came for.
- please that's the multiple telegraph Bell is working on. if it works, and I'm sure my theory is right,
I ought to be able to send as many as 50 messages at a time over one wire. get him interested Alec and your financial worries are over. he's the best organizer in Boston he's the man who brought gets to this towns well I'll be delighted to explain it to you sir. you see... when I press this letter... -Some other time Mr. Bell. Some other time. right now I'm more interested in what you're doing for Sanders boy than I am in any newfangled invention
Oh yes. We'll go right in.
Excuse me. This way, please.
May we see George?
- He's asleep but I'm sure he'd want to see his father
Go ahead sir.
Shall I speak to him?
I told him to shake hands with you. -And he understood you?
You saw what he did.
Now I'm asking you if I should tell you how our glove works.
We began by teaching him to spell... simple words like C-A-T and then showing him a cat.
Now by touching the letters or... or rather combination of letters
I can talk to him as rapidly as I can to you.
But I understood you were teaching him to actually speak.
Watch this?
Have you ever succeeded in teaching a child it was born deaf to speak?
No, and as far as I know, nobody else has.
But I have great hopes and they'll still young.
But he's had some mighty interesting experiences with sound and speech tell about the melody.
Well... I crumble family that that has made a professional study on mechanism of speech for two generations before me.
My grandfather,
Alexander Bell and my father Alexander
Melville Bell were elocutionist who devoted their entire lives to the correction of defects of speech.
Perhaps you've read some of their books on the subject.
Well, from earliest childhood
I was trained to become a teacher of speech.
That, and the fact that my mother was deaf, led me to my present interest in deaf mutes.
And, well... mute wires like the telegraph.
Mr. Bell I have a little girl of my own that I want you to work with.
She had scarlet feve when she was 4 years old it had left her stone deaf. I've had her in Germany learning lip-reading.
Well I'm sorry sir but when
I'm not working with George,
I spend all my time working on my telegraph.
Come over to supper to
Saturday night and we'll talk it over.
Well I hope you like beans, Boston baked beans.
No not much and besides... -You like the kind my cook prepares.
Come on Sanders it's 2 and a half minutes past 9:00.
Nevermind Ellie, you'll have a fine chance to tell him about your telegraph instrument Saturday night.
M-y-s-o-n. it's kind of slippery isn't it?
Young lady, may I suggest the sidewalk is no place for sleds.
The sidewalk is very narrow, the ice makes one's footing very uncertain you might have ruined the most important piece of electrical equipment the city of Boston. oh I can excuse such behavior in children, but I but I don't, well...
- what did you say?
I said you are no longer a child and that I think...
I'm sorry, would you mind speaking a little more distinctly?
Young lady I come from a long line of elocution teachers.
My grandfather, my father wrote text books on the subject.
I think I know what I'm speaking distinctly. Good night!
I'm sorry but you see I...
The essential parts of both my transmitter and my receiver are these tune reads made of flattened steel clock Springs. one end of which is attached to poles of these electromagnets, while the other end is free to vibrate over the other poles like this
Interesting, isn't it, dear? - 6:26 mother.
Yes dear, but I'm sure separate would be aankhon.
The transmitter has maken breakpoints. - Ah, come in, my dear, come in.
Mr. Bell this is my little girl Gertrude.
Your little... oh but but I thought...
How do you do miss Hubbard?
- Very well, thank you.
And these are my three other little girls. Berta, Mabel and Grace.
Mr. Bell.
Good evening, my dear.
How are you?
- Papa. -Mr. Bell, this is the little girl I was telling you about.
Mr. Bell and I have already met I believe. -Met?
What do you mean met? He just got here.
Uh I think I knocked him down.
And I'm awfully sorry if your... whatever it was was ruined.
Oh no, not at all.
Mr. Bell makes things, dear.
He was just telling us about his telegraph when you came in.
I beg your pardon mama? -His telegraph.
Telegraph? That?
Oh, please go on.
Oh, yes please. -We do have to hear about it.
Well, I was just saying when a spring sends its electrical tone into the wire... theoretically only its mate and receiver should respond. and if I set up a number of sets of springs tuned to different pitches... then I could send a several number of messages over the same wire.
I'm sorry if I said anything out there to offend you.
But you didn't.
Of course not.
And... and do go on.
Well that's about all.
Except that it may not work.
Oh, but it will work.
I'm sure they.
Suffered a service of it.
- Thank you Nora.
Alright, this is a third successive night suppose been late.
I'm sorry dear I'll speak to cook. Go on, girls.
Mr. Bell, supper. -Mr. Bell,
I hope you like beans.
Of Boston baked beans.
Didn't you think you had a very nice face?
Oh, papa. You know very well I didn't mean, papa.
Oh, then you mean
Mr. Bell. -Yeah so good.
Mr. Bell. - why thought he looked all right?
For playing man. Didn't you think your nice nose? it was awfully Roman or something
Oh, yes nice eyes to. It blaze so when he talks.
I think you're in love navel
Oh, Goody! -Navel survived, navel survived.
Goody. - It was advertising father for putting money in this telegraph imagine Papa green to pay for his experiment.
Mr. Bells is the first voice
I've ever really wanted to hear.
Oh darling of course he's wonderful
He's a mom. - Do you think he like me Gertie?
I mean even if I can...
- of course he will. that'll make him like you ten times as much
You won't feel sorry for me.
It won't be that, will it?
- Oh no, of course not.
Then I go to marry him.
- What? -I'm going to marry him.
I knew it the first time I saw him. I just made up my mind like that.
But, papa. Oh, what will papa say?
I don't care what papa will say.
I'll just close my eyes and then it won't be able to hear him.
And besides, papa must doesn't know yet.
Nobody must know yet. Only you.
Oh, but you know how I am about secrets.
I'll just die if I can't tell it.
- But you won't tell this Gertie.
You promise me you won't tell.
Well I won't if you promise to tell me everything he says he does.
Alright. Alright I promise. -Shh, papa.
Gertrude? You and Mable stop that foolish cheddar. don't you know it's exactly...
11 minutes past 10:00.
Put out the lights and go to bed.
Yes Papa. -What did he say?
- Is that to go to bed.
Alright, we go in to bed.
You know, if you had married him I would.
Oh, Gerti.
Don't you love New England in the spring Mr. Bell?
Spring? yes is very nice we often come out here for picnics.
Mother and father and well all of us.
You do
I'm sorry Mr. Bell but you'll have to look at mirror
I can't see what you're saying.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Ou. Ou.
Won't you tell me what's wrong? - Wrong? - yes.
Yes, you've hardly spoken a word to me since we started.
Have I said I've done anything to offend you?
Oh, no certainly not. it's just that... well I've been thinking.
Yes? - you see it may take years before I get anywhere with the telegraph and I was just wondering whether or not I ought to go on with it.
Go on with it?
- Suppose I don't want to wait.
Suppose are things I want to do now while I'm young... things I might do if I gave all my time to a regular position like teaching at Boston University... or something.
What sort of things do you want, Mr. Bell?
Oh I don't know.
A wife... home. finish your telegraph first the wife will wait
She will?
- Oh yes, Mr. Bell.
I'm sure she will.
- Oh. Oh thank you.
But... that's all I wanted to know. oh but but there's something else I ought to tell you. - Yes?
I'm not as interested in the telegraph as I used to be.
You're not? No, ever since I went to Brantford to visit my family last Christmas
I'd had a new idea rattling around in my head.
He did the biggest idea
I've ever had in my life. all the craziest. wouldn't you like to tell me about it well I have an idea but if I could make a kind of electricity vary in intensity exactly as the air varies in density when sound passes through it then then I could transmit sound even speech telegraphicly.
I'm sorry but... I don't understand.
I mean I could talk through a wire. talk through a wire?
- yes I could send a human voice, as... as far as wires could be strung. hah but that doesn't seem possible uh-huh I can't believe... it it's talking through a wire?
I guess it's crazy
Oh when you going to start work on it Mr. Bell?
Monday night.
- Oh.
Thomas Watson an electrician who makes all my apparatus for me is moving in with me to help me oh then then you were really asking me for my endorsement and not my advise.
Something like that.
- Oh, huh.
Mr. Bell if you spend all your time working on this, how will you live?
Oh I'll manage somehow.
But, don't think I want to use the money your father lends me for anything but the telegraph.
Oh, no. - I'm gonna work on this new idea in my spare time.
Oh, yes. Yes I understand.
But Mr. Bell if I were you I wouldn't tell my father about this yet.
You see, he gets off the upset if people don't finish what they started out to do.
Couldn't this be our secret for a little while?
Perhaps that would be. Why is he?
And safer.
- Much safer Mr. Bell.
Much.
Mother. Mother. Oh, mother.
- Mabel, we're you been?
Oh mother I've just been to the most glorious drive in the world.
Oh, I'm so happy.
- hmm.
Mabel do you realize what time it is you missed your supper.
Oh, please papa, don't scold me tonight.
Not tonight. - We've been worrying about you for hours something might have happened to you child. it's all right now garden
- it was all my fault Mr. Hubbart.
I talked so much neither of us noticed the time no and and finally we had to stop under the streetlight so... so I could see what he was saying. but the time just slipped by. -Yes.
Mother Alec get such wonderful ideas. -Alec? -Alec?
Oh, I mean Mr. Bell.
- well please call me Alec.
All right.
- She call he Alec.
Mr. Bell won't you stay and have something to eat?
Oh no, no. Not now.
I... I must be going.
Good night, Miss summer.
- Good night. -Good night mr. Hubbard.
Good night.
- Good night.
Good night.
- Good night.
Good night everybody. come do you must be hungry
I couldn't eat a thing. not tonight mother.
Good night.
Good night, papa.
Getrude! Getrude!
Oh, the most exciting thing is just happened. Come on.
# Oh car keeps pining for one kind word
# call me pet names dearest call me Alec
# Pack, pack, the boys are packing cheer up farmers they will come haha
Careful Watson, you'll break something.
Good then you'll have to buy more stuff from our boss. listen if it hadn't been for your boss overcharging me, we wouldn't been turned out of here. - stop argue you'll get turn out of better places in this before you're through.
You needn't bother packing your things mr. Bell nothing's leaving this house until I get my rent.
You... you mean you're going to hold my things?
The long gives me that right I certainly shall.
But Mrs. McGregor ah I told you I'd send you your money as soon as I can.
There's no use to arguing. Out you go, but your things stay here.
I won't leave them.
I can't. I've got to happen.
Oh, no. You don't know about.
Things stay right here.
No, not. Not that.
Not his vocal cords.
Vocal cords? -Yes those belong to a Chinaman.
They've got pickled over at Harvard.
Get it out of here. Get all this junk out of here! -Junk?
Did you say junk? -Yes don't get it out of my house.
I'm sick and tired of seeing it around. you've had this base looking like a pigsty long enough get it out before I throw it out the window or burn it up.
Mrs. MacGregor at this moment I can almost kiss you. don't you dare lay a hand on.
To fake that I have so misjudged you.
In fact I'll even give you the very shirt off of my back.
Remove uncommon and I'll have you arrested.
Come on, before she changes her mind. Get them.
Hi! Ou, Jenny.
Hello mr. Sanders.
- What's going on here?
I'm leaving. -Leaving? -Yes, I'm taking George back to his grandmother's.
I don't understand Alec.
You've taken my money you build up my hopes and now you're walking out on my boy.
Oh I'm not walking out, sir. I'm I'm being thrown out.
But you had money I paid you only last thursday and how... -Well I... I use that for some new equipment
Then why didn't you ask me for an advance?
Oh you... you don't understand sir. I... I expect to be working nights and... and where I'm going isn't a suitable place for George that's why I'm taking him back to his grandmother's.
But that's in Salem.
What about you work with him?
Well, I expect to go to
Salem every other day. That's all.
I'm sorry Alec. I ought to have known you better than that.
It's all right mrs. Sanders.
- Al, hurry, here she comes.
Mr. Bell, take this awful thing.
Well, I will find you. On the entire quarter and leave one all-night party known as
Williams Electric Company.
Well, we're slow are you gonna take with that.
I'm ready now.
We can try it again.
Honest I know penis
I'm just a plain ordinary man. all right sweep like a human being do.
And I oh I've got a sitter day after day... night after night... wasting away... tapping a little piece of metal.
I do remember when I used to know pretty girls been in another world.
It's not mumble. Maybe on the birth of great discovery.
Long as I can remember we found the bird at great discovery.
Look here, I can only find four new springs.
I thought I told you to get fired.
I'm sure I told you to get fired.
I remember now you had just enough money to pay for the five new springs of 25 cents each.
Now where is that new springs?
I ate it. - You did what?
- I didn't mean to.
I was going along and I..
I saw that food in the window... suddenly I got such a craving I couldn't stand it.
I went by twice I tried not to go in, but...
I couldn't help. But I was hungry.
I can't go on living forever with.-  So,  you ate one of my springs?
You took the last 25 cents we had to fill your miserable little stuff.
Yes I did! I told you I'm no genius.
I'm through starving I'll go out to the Indian territory lived on buffalo steak, and you or nobody else's stop me. - Wait!
All the paint off that you might why money is yours. Show me! Show me what would you do it.
Do? I didn't do anything but you did something I saw it I heard it.
Moo, little spring stopped vibrating I just plucked at, that all.-  But I heard a sound. a full musical note with overtones through the wire.
Show me everything you did.
- Well, this this contact screw grad stack.
Make a pun on contact with the spring? - Yes...
I just snapped it. - while the... while the circuit remained unbroken?
I suppose so.
Then that strip a magnetized steel was generating its own current.
Do it again. No, wait.
No, wait, wait, wait!
All right, do it now.
It worked. It works.
It works. I read it again.
Are you an Indian? - Sure, the Six Nations tuck me in.
Well that makes it all right then.
Don't you understand?
We've accidentally found the undulating current that I've been looking for, for the first time in the history of the world we've sent sound through a wire.
For the first time nothing. Well this has happened in nearly every electrician.
What you mean is it's the first time the right man is hurted know what it meant.
Is that true?
- Why certainly.
If you know anything about electricity you hadn't paid any attention to it.
Well, anyhow I was there that's the important thing just think we started to work on a telegraph, and now we're on the trail of the electric telephone.
Telephone instead? - It's an apparatus for transmitting the voice.
It means sound from a far.
Here. Hold this. -  Where you going?
Where I'm going? Going to tell Mabel, of course.
Telephone.
Mr. Bell. -  Where's miss Mable?
- She's upstairs, sir. I'll tell her you're here.
Oh well would you please put the gas up in the parlour, sir while I tell miss Mable you're here.
- Ask him hurry please it's awfully important.
Very good, sir.
Alec.
Mabel. - Hi, Alec. - Mabel,
I've just discovered the most...
Mabel, now we can get married.
What ? - Will you marry me?
Hurry, tell me.
- Yes.-  You will?
Who goes that Alec.
- Oh, thank you.
But I never had any other intention.
Oh, no, no.
Not here.
Alec, don't you gotta tell me you love me?
Oh please, I want to hear you say.
I love you darling.
It's a dark in here I can't see.
Nothing.
- I love you.
Again.
- I love you.
Don't say a word, don't move, don't even breathe.
I want to remember this moment all my life.
Just as it is.
Oh!
- What is it?
I forgot what... what
I came here to tell you.
My telephone. I've got it. I've found a way to talk through a wire.
How did you heaven? - That's why I asked you to marry me.
You wait here. I've got to tell your father. - No, no, no.
No Alec. He's... he's reading and maybe a better wait.
Not me. You tell your mom and the girls.
I'll handle him.
- No.
Mr. Hubbard. - Just a moment, Mr. Bell
I always allow myself 30' with the classics every evening.
In the past 40 years I dare say
I haven't missed three such evenings except perhaps on my honeymoon.
Habit. Habit Mr. Bell is the important thing.
Setting a regular time for everything and sticking to it.
Yes sir, but... - What lesson there are young people today or in trying to postpone?
To shift, dodge and put on. My father always said:
"People were prepared to make any effort the day after tomorrow."
"But when it comes to doing a thing today"
"that's another matter".
How about cigar? - No, no, thank you.
You I just want on go and smoke it.
There's nothing like a good cigar to help settle your stomach.
Now Mr. Bell... you wanted to see me.
Yes, sir. Mable and
I get married now.
Sit down Mr. Bell.
This afternoon I made a very valuable discovery.
I actually sent sound through a wire without the use of battery.
You did what? - Before Lorna
I'll be able to send speech, talk from any distance.
- Before how long?
I don't, know but I'm sure
I'll make a telephone some day.
Telephone, huh?
What about your telegraph? oh I'm gonna give that up this is much bigger and newer.
As my daughter accepted you? - Yes, sir.
And she loves me too.
Mr. Bell, when I married the lady you proposed to make your mother-in-law
I was owning 4,000 dollars a year.
In addition I had certain prospects for my father which promised ample security for my wife and children.
May I ask what prospects you have?
- Well I haven't any prospects.
Unless it's the telephone.
- Mr. Bell I'd like to call your attention to a few peculiarities which
I've observed about your character.
Oh, I know I'm not worthy ever, sir. - In the first place
I'd say you are emotionally unstable.
You jump from one enthusiasm to another with reckless abandon.
To begin with it was the multiple telegraph that consumed your time and energies.
Now you tell me you're no longer interested in the telegraph but have gone skipping off in pursuit of some new proposition. you may waste your own time if you please.
But, the sooner you stop wasting my money, the better.
I won't give this up. I can't.
In that case... disabuse your mind of the idea of marrying my daughter.
But mr. Hubbard we... we love each other.
Nevertheless you are not to come here again Mr. Bell.
Or even attempt to see my daughter.
Not so long as you persist in this folly.
By them all if you propose to give up possible profitable venture for an air castle you needn't expect any more support for me.
I wash my hands of the whole business. - But Mr. Hubbard none...
12 after 8. I should have been well past Harvard Square by now.
Would you like to accompany me on my constitutional mr. Bell?
The night air is very refreshing.
No, thank you.
- Well, good night.
Now take this little egg.
I crack it I'd drop it tenderly into the grease.
That quiver isn't is still. Result: hunger.
But, take this same little egg...
I leave it to nestled tenderly and lovingly under its mother's breast snug and warm.
Soon it becomes flesh and feathers.
Then it too is dropped tenderly into the grease... again it Quivers... and is still result... a feast
Listen to me, my fine friend.
So I'm gonna stand over a hot stove night after night you can't expect me to live on half an a egg.
God fall apart I'm sick of me
I'm sick of the very thought of you.
Hey, that's what I think of the hours the months we've wasted on that stupid idea.
You say you're tired.
You're hungry. Well, so am I. don't look like other men just as much as you do.
I want a decent bed to sleep indeed decent food to eat.
But I'm in love.
I want to get married.
And I will. And if I ever have a child that... that so much as looks at a piece of copper wire or mentions electricity out...
What about all your work your plans?
It's all done.
How much were you getting up there Williams Electric Company?
Three dollars a day. Why?
Better see if a job is still open
Lee. I won't be needing you anymore.
You're quitting? - Yes I'm going back to teaching the deaf. if I ever decide to work on the telegraph do it my spare time.
The telephone.
- Uh... it was just on air kiss.
Does Mabel know about this?
No, I'm gonna write her now.
You got any paper?
Where do we get any paper?
This'll do.
What's the date?
June 11.
June 11
Mother. - Yes, dear.
-  Mother, I've got to see Alec.
I know, dear. I know what you've been through this past month.
No I mean now
I've got to go to him. Come on. - Mabel!
To his room? Have you gone out of your... - Mother I can't help it.
I must see him. Now, today.
This minute. - Oh my child.
What would your father say?
- Mother, my eyes are closed.
I'm not listening to you.
Oh, please you got to go with me I've got to see him.
But Alec, you can't give up your telephone just because father says so.
That it'd be criminal.
I know what I want and I've made up my mind to heaven.
Perhaps Alec is right, dear.
Oh mother, why do you say that, you know he's not right.
But after all you two love each other. In't that enough?
It is for me.
Well, that isn't to me.
Alec, if you give up your telephone I... I... promise I'll never marry you. - Oh may...  - I mean it Alec.
Child, child.
- It's up to Jean.
Mabel... I'll never fail you again.
Never.
- Oh, Alec.
You wake?
- Mm-hmm.
What are you thinking about?
Mabel
- So was I.
I was thinking now I got to make a telephone.
I've got to find a receiver.
Some way to get speech.
I'd all I'll be just as badly off as I was before she came here.
Would it be wonderful if we should invent the telephone?
Had turned out to be the very thing that could make her hear.
You had any imagination and you anything about sound you know that can't happen.
How do you know, you aren't God.
I know because in the human ear when vibrations strike against the eardrum... they caused tiny bones in the back of the head to oscillate.
But enables case the nerve current and back of those bones... has been permanently injured.
Even if sound waves caused the bones to oscillate... cause the bones to oscillate oscillate oscillate
Anjali
What? What? What?
I got it. I got it!
What's? St. Vitus day?
- No, no, the ear.
What ear? - This, this here, come on, come on, get up.
We've got to get an ear... a human ear.
And study it. It may give us just what we need for our receiver.
You're crazy. Where are you gonna get a human ear?
I'll sharpen my razor and you go out.
Never mind never mind we'll get in here somehow.
And maybe... maybe this time... just think.
Out of Mabel's deafness we make the whole world here.
Ya, know but on here a human ear, you can't do that!
Well use the same principle as the ear exactly.
Only we use gold beater skin instead of membrane, and and a small piece of metal in front of an electromagnet instead of the bones.
And we'll use more batteries.
That's what we gotta have.
More batteries.  - Yeah it's gonna take a lot of money.
Gold beater skin batteries acids. - We'll get them somehow.
Maybe you can get another advance for mr. Sanders.
No, no. I gotta figure some of the way.
I've had three advances from him already for less and less work with George.
We... could both of us go back to work for a little while.
Be nice to eat again for change too.
No, no. That's... that's not the way.
We've got to find a cheaper place to live.
Cheaper than this?
Certainly. What? I wouldn't stay here even even if they'd let us use the shop.
That it's too noisy, too dangerous there's there too many people about.
We're not gonna tell anybody what we're doing.
Yet.
- We'll starve.
Maybe you will, but not me.
Until I've made it telephone.
Charming place, such atmosphere.
Boiled cabbage and flat beer I'd say.
Oh, it's you. Well don't forget
Mr Bell, this is for lodgings only.
You think you got to get any food without paying for it, you got another thing coming. Understand? lady we only eat at the Parker house.
You laugh 50 cents be alright?
Merry Christmas, sir.
- Merry Christmas.
Turkeys twelve and a half cents a pound, extra fine.
I may come back for one later on. - Yes, sir.
Right now I'll ever have fond of cheese, and two apples. - Very good, sir.
Sure you don't want this?
No if at all I want.
Apples and cheese cheese and appes, apples...
What's the matter?
I don't know. Everything went black in front of me.
I feel so dizzy.
Maybe I'd better lie down for a few minutes.
Were you lied, you haven't eaten.
I don't I... don't think I was hungry.
Now you stay on the bed, I'm going out and get something to eat. to find out back in 15', you know I got caught.
You see anything with an ear on it?
Bring it back please.
- How about a landlady?
Ah stomachs are funny things.
I know. I should growl like a lion when you neglect him.
Fill him up again, they settle down just like a kitten.
Sure nobody saw you?
- I saw him chasing the cat, so...
I expect I'm saving up.
How that these cigars were sort of a nice afterthought.
I had my heart set on a plum pudding when I couldn't find it. we should find a well done battery with ear loosing all out of it.
Well, we can't sit here all day.
Let's get to work.
On Christmas Eve? - What's the matter with Christmas Eve?
Well Christmas may not mean anything to you, but it does to me.
I'm not moving. I'm gonna sit right here and belch till morning.
Whoa mr. Santa's it's only you. Mome in.
Marry Christmas.
- Marry Christmas.
Marry Christmas. My slaves downstairs get your coats on right away.
You're spending Christmas at my place in Salem.
Christmas would you?
- That's right.
We've got a long ride ahead of us, so hurry up.
Oh but we can't I planned a lot of work for today. And I'm...
Sorry if you forget it it's just what I needed. Come on, let's go.

Well, Alec you mustn't take him out there. Not tonight.
Oh think of his presence the tree in Santa Claus. ah huh
I don't understand this, Alec.
Fath-er.
Fath-er.
And you didn't have a
Christmas present for anyone?
Thanks mr. Sanders now we have acids and batteries.
You want in the other room listen while I do the talking.
Even if it worked you couldn't hear me after Alec talking I'm down.
Ahoy Mr. Watson.
Are you there?
I now have water in the transmitter cup.
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Ahoy Mr. Watson.
Can you hear me now?
This is Alexander Bell speaking to you from Five exeter place on March 10, 1876. ahoy ahoy
Mr. Watson, come here.
I want you.
It talk. Mr. Bell. I heard you, I heard you're voice!
Hurry I burn.
- But, I heard you.
Your voice through the wire
I could hear what you said.
What I say, tell me? - Yeah. you said
"Mr. Watson come here, I want you".
That's right.
- Oh, huh, what did you do?
I put two drops of sulfuric acid in the water.
That made the water a conductor for the electric current transmitting the voice.
Oh, my leg. - Stop hollering.  You can't do something about that burn.
Hold on. I've got to tell
Mabel first. - Oh no, you don't.
You sit down take your britches on.
I get some large.
- But, I've got to tell Mabel.
I might have known so much does it happen leaving a lot of acids around you.
Ladies and gentlemen... now that the telephone that is an accomplished fact it gives me great pleasure to... to demonstrate its practical use in in the social and business world.
In a moment my associate mr. Thomas Watson... will speak to you... from the city of Boston... 20 miles away.
Uh for thee for the benefit of the audience additional receivers have been placed at strategic points throughout the hall.
Ahoy mr. Watson. this is Alexander
Graham Bell, speaking to you from Salem.
Can you hear me?
- Ahoy, Mr. Bell.
Ahoy mr. Watson, the audience is now applauding you.
Will you continue your demonstration?
You're next.
Hail Columbia, happy land where heroes heaven-born ban who came to town the other night to hit around see a fighting hero Kyrgyz banjo that so gently for me stealing spider-like meets revealing that I dearly love the star-spangled banner along me
Yankee Doodle came to town riding on a pony stuck a feather in his cap and called it sweet, gentle... (?)
Now begin obtained by a fallen soul.
Stop it I tell you.
Ahoy, Mr. Bell.
I have a special treat for you tonight.
There is a lady president is going to speak you.
The first woman's voice ever to be heard publicly over the telephone.
Say something in here quick.
- All I've got to say is this:
How dare you? What right have you? Doing is it's wonderful. -  Well, I only laugh because I...
Thought leaders geez he's doubting an ally well he better not be
And that that ladies and gentlemen concludes our demonstration scene.
Anyone desiring further information will kindly step up here and and leave his name.
What makes it talk father?
- It's just a plain hollow wire.
You talk it with it one end naturally the voice comes out at the other.
Very amusing evening Mr. Bell
Imagine putting one of those things in your home and expecting your wife to use it.
And would you really think there's nothing to it?
Gardiner in my opinion the telephone will never be anything more than a toy.
You would put any of your money into it or advise your friends to do so?
I shall urge all my friends they have nothing to do with it.
Thanks I just wanted
Mr. Bell to have your opinion.
Good night.
- Good night. -  Good night.
Good night Mr. Hubbard.
- Good night Miss Hubbard.
Wasn't it all right Alec?
Well?
Mr. Hubbard is one of my partners.
Will you see that the necessary papers are drawn up for the
New England telephone company?
Did I understand you to say partners Mr. Bell?
You and mr. Sanders put up all the money for my experiments.
It's only fair that you should share in the returns.
But I have no right in this.
I never put any money in your telephone, the money I gave you was for your telegraph.
I'm not asking you for any money, sir.
All you've got to do is help me incorporate.
I've already talked to the Williams company about manufacturing our telephones.
Watson and I can install them.
And I suppose the next thing you'll be wanting us to wire every house and public building in the country.
We might have to do that too eventually.
Mr. Bell, tomorrow morning Sanders and I are going to have our heads examined.
Just for standing here listening to such nonsense.
Good night.
Come on Sanders.
In the meanwhile we better start looking over our assets.
It looks as if we're in the telephone business now. if he doesn't have apoplexy before morning he'll come along. If we both don't have a apoplexy.
This must be pretty serious your father calling me here.
I'm afraid it is.
Didn't need any second.
Oh, Mr. Bell come in.
Sit down.
- Thank you, sir.
Good evening miss
Summer. -  Good evening.
Mr. Bell I have here an itemized account of the expenses
I've incurred in connection with your telephone  during the past year.
To my amazement I find that I'm involved to the extent of 7070 $ against which has assets.
I can count only 207 telephone installations at a net rental loss of 621 $.
Now what I want to know is, what are you going to do about it?
I have it all figured out, sir.
I'm going to England. - England? yes sir I've had a letter from Sir William Thompson.
One of the greatest scientists in England.
You know, the man who made the transatlantic cable possible. he says he's heard about the telephone that there's a great deal of interest in it over there.
If I go over there, he feels sure he can arrange a demonstration before Queen Victoria.
Queen Victoria.
- Yes, darling.
He says the Queen will install telephones in the palace, then the whole world will follow suit.
Just as they copy your hats.
- Right Alec, that's a splendid idea.
Of course they will. - May I ask who's going to pay for this pilgrimage?
Well sir I felt that as long as you and mr. Sanders already have so much money involved, you will be... - Mr.Bell, I used to call you a fool. I apologize, you're a genius.
I'm the fool. -  But... - Young man, you have a blissful disregard for money.
That may be an end ruble as set to a genius but not to a business partner.
Hubbart. - Father I'm sure we could manage somehow.
Did you say we? - Mabel?
- Oh... - Mabel? - Yes, papa.
I'm going with him.
- You're what?
Help. I can't let you go
3.000 miles away from me. - Mabel.
Father we've waited long enough.
If Alec goes to England,
I'm going with him.
You will take me with you won't you?
You don't think I'd go without you, do you?
Oh, darling. - Mabel.
- Father my eyes are closed.
Mr. Bell, will you stop this.
- Gardener, she's right.
You kept these young people apart long enough.
Mother.
- Oh, my goodness.
Oh what have I said.
Boom tongue.
Alec, hey darling let me do it for you.
I don't know why I must be so clumsy.
Oh, oh you're you're choking me they'll hang it for that. This is England. they hang you over here even for killing a mere husband.
Dear darling, I think that looks alright.
You know Victoria may be queen of the British Empire an island it anywhere else she chooses.
But she's also a woman.
And what's more she's a widow.
- But a rich widow, don't forget that.
Uh-huh. She has ladies-in-waiting too.
In waiting for handsome young men like me?
Well Hallie guy, I'm just warning you.
Can't even wink at her just once? - Oh, darling.
I don't care if the Queen kisses you.
Just as long as she puts telephones in her palace.
Perhaps she will.
Tonight is our night.
And we can be all of your x-men ladies all the money you owe them.
And Watson could even self into the count.
Mr. Bell can have all the time he wants to make love to his wife.
There isn't that much time.
Oh great heavens what... what am I thinking about.
I mustn't keep the Queen waiting. - Alec.
Good luck.
- Thank you dear.
Oh, please let
Victoria install telephone.
From my Alec.
Sir William Thompson tells us that your telephone is a marvelous instrument Mr. Bell.
Sir Williams is very kind, Your majesty.
Is this the device?
- yes, ma'am.
There's a similar instrument Osborn cottage where Sir Thomas bit off is waiting to hear your Majesty's voice.
You expect me to speak into that?
If your majesty would be so gracious.
I think you had better speak into it.
After all one does not converse with a wire.
Beatrice, major Phipps, come closer.
Listen. - If you please ma'am we're ready to begin.
You may proceed.
- Sir Thomas, bit off.
That is the Thomas's voice.
Ask him the time.
Sir Thomas Her Majesty wishes to know the time.
I think I will speak into it after all.
Sir Thomas, your watch is two minutes slow. Set it.
Sir William you were right.
This is a marvelous invention.
General, we will have Mr. Bell's telephone installed in Buckingham Palace.
Yes, Your majesty.
It will be an honor, ma'am.
The Americans are a very inventive people.
Mr. bill was born in
Edinburgh, Your majesty.
He went to Canada several years ago and then to America.
The Scots are very inventive too.
Now have it say something else Mr. Bell.
Hey Mable. She likes it. She wants telephones at Buckingham Palace.
Yes, darling I knew she.
- Tomorrow the court caliber carry the news of that to the whole world that court will to talk to a wire. 
Alec, wait a minute, this just came tonight from father. - What is it? 
What is this?
- Yeah I read it to you.
Dear child, your mother and I hesitate to cast a cloud on your happiness, but no longer can we hide renew the terrible things that are going on here.
Ever since your marriage there's been nothing but trouble, a new telephone company, known as the American speaking telephone company, has been organized with a
Western Union company... begging, and has entered the field against us with their own instrument, which they advertise as the product of the original inventors meaning Doe bear gray and others... they boasted their telephone is infinitely superior to Alex... they've got everybody afraid him to deal with us cancellations are pouring in... we'd hope to spare you this at least until Alec at seeing the Queen, but there isn't... but that is no longer possible. 
Unless a miracle happens to say this Sanders and I stand to lose all, our homes, our credit everything.
You're loving but sparing father.
What are you going to do? - Do?
I fight them, of course.
Fight them tooth and nail... with... with everything we've got.
Of course you will, darling. Of course.
Superior is it.
Superior to mine, hmm?
We've go home on the first boat. 
Will show them! 
Maybe we are poor... maybe my telephone is still... crippled and... and lane... maybe... maybe it is still... still in want... but it's part of my blood and brains.
It's mine, all mine!
And they'll never take it away from me!
It's my child!
Did your other child like, Alec.
Well...
Just one thing after another.
Ahoy! Can that speak louder, please?
Mrs. Croll like to speak Mr. Blackford.
Just a moment, please.
Go ahead.
Clears 17.
Well? - Sorry, no more credit from the banks.
They gave me back the telephone stock I put up for that last loan. 
Said they prefers my personal note.
The Williams company say they can't manufacture another telephone, unless they get older some money.
At the rate cancellations are coming in we won't need him.
What's worrying me is, how are we gonna meet this week's payroll. 
I forgot to tell you, we've hired Theodore
Vail as our general manager. - What? 
And Francis Blake's working on a transmitter that'll stand up well there's anyway. 
Mr. Hubbard thinks Vail is the best man in the country for the job. 
It was really your idea. - Well,
I must say you've got nerve. 
And another thing, tomorrow we'll bring him soon against the American speaking telephone company charging infringement on our patents.
We're going to fight a 40 million-dollar concern the Western Union? 
We're gonna fight every company in the country infringing on our patents.
What else can we do? 
- But look at the odds against us.
They've got the best lawyers money can buy. 
If we lose the court costs alone will wipe us out. 
Well, that's a chance we'll have to take.
Well... there's an old saying, sell all you have and give to the poor.
If you think it is any application in this case, 
I still have an old farm up in Maine that... - I knew I could count on you. 
I was too young for the Civil War but this looks like as good a fight as any to me. 
Thanks Tom.
We'll probably see plenty of action.
- Just what are you going to fight with?
The truth.
Well son, has always been a pretty good weapon. 
Perhaps more people ought to use it.
BELL SUES AMERICAN SPEAKING
TELEPHONE COMPANY
IN FIGHT OVER
TELEPHONE PATENTS
Peter A. Dowd, Agent of Western
Union, Named in Suit b Bell
New York City Scene of Telephone Trial
Proceed.
Your Honor, it has not been the intention of my clients to burn this court with wordy debates.
We have endeavored to confine ourselves to the facts.
First, that Alexander Bell was not the first to invent the telephone. 
Second, that the patents under which the New England Bell Telephone Company have been operating were fraudulently obtained... and fair... we have defied the plaintiff to show that Mr. Bell been working on the undulating current feature of the telephone prior to February 14, 1876... at which time by strange coincidence both he and Mr. Gray informed the Patent Office simultaneously of their work on the telephone. 
Very well, counsel may proceed. 
Mr. Bell, what is your occupation?
I'm a teacher the deaf.
- Are you an American citizen?
Yes, sir, an American citizen by choice. 
I see.
Now Mr. Bell, have you any proof to give us that you were working on the... underlit or a feature of the telephone prior to February 1876?
Only my word, and the word of my friends.
Not a notebook, not a little scrap of paper? 
Not even a pencil mark on a wall, nothing? - No sir.
I didn't have time to record my findings. - It seems to me very convenient.
You have heard, of course... that not one but five other men were working along similar lines prior to February 1876.
- That's what I've been told in this courtroom. 
Oh come, come Mr. Bell.
Are you trying to impeach our witnesses?
Have you any proof that they were not so engaged? 
No sir. But I repeat... I was working on my system early in 1875.
And that I first produce sound through a wire... on June 2nd of that same year.
And that on March 10th... 1876... a human voice... mine... was heard through a wire for the first time in history.
Mr. Bell I have here a certain sheets of paper... which you have identified as rough drafts of your patents application. please correspond with your final patent applications. 
No, sir. 
- Why not?
I wrote and rewrote those specifications a great many times. 
Those sheets are... mere fragmentary remains... that happen to be... accidentally preserved. - Hmm.
Well, I don't see any mention of the undulating... current in this... rough draft as you call it.
- Those statements were... added as I completed and redraft my application.
Mr. Bell, could those specifications have been added after you had fire your application? 
Certainly not.
I mean could you have gained illegal access to the Patents office and copied into your application certain paragraphs... from a paper or a chariot had been filed the same day as your patent application?
Your question is insulting
I refuse to hear it. - Answer me, sir!
Did you connive to steal the basic principle of your telephone? 
Yes, or no!
I have only contempt for such a question.
Thank you Mr. Bell.
Your honnor, I protest against the tactics of some of our opponents... in the name of decency and fair play
I protest against
Mr. Bell's foul and insinuations.
Your honor, I'm sorry that my learned colleague is so thin-skinned.
All we ask of Mr. Bell is that he produced one single bit of legal proof... one memorandum one scrap of paper proving his contentions of priority. 
But, will he?
No. Can he? No.
And why not? Because, Your honor, he hasn't any proof! Non exists!
Mr. Bell, this court desires to afford you every opportunity to establish your claims.
If you have any proof, I shall expect you to have it here monday morning.
Until then, this
Court stands adjourned.
Court adjourned.
Alec, are you sure you have no papers, no sketches, nothing?
Nothing. But I know.
- What are you going to do?
I've done all I can do.
I'm going home.
- Home? You can't do that.
I've heard all of this I want to hear.
I'm gonna be with Mable when our baby is born.
But Alec, may be weeks yet. You can't be certain about the first baby.
I'm sorry, I'm going. - At least let me telegraph and find out when you'll be.
Alec, stay. - If you leave now I can promise you, you'll lose.
Mother and I leaving immediately.
Don't dare leave trial.
Is that alright?
- Yes, that's fine, dear. 
Ah, ah.
Would you send this for me, please?
Would you care to add the word love, madam?
That'll make it exactly ten words.
Yes. Yes, make it love, Mable.
Shades of glory, is this man to be allowed to control a great public benefaction? 
Permitted to foist an inferior article on the public.
Just to gratify his egotism.
Your honor I, submit that the only invention to which our friend is undeniably entitled... is the invention of the story, that he was working on the under the torrid current prior to February 1876.
Order! - He said nice water to... - Order in the court!
Take your seats, please.
Mable, what are you doing here? 
I couldn't bear the thought of your leaving, I had to come.
At a time like this, it's dangerous.
No, darling, I'm all right.
And Alec... Alec
I found this.
It might be the very evidence you're looking for. - Evidence?
Evidence? - Yes.
Do you remember this?
It's a letter that you wrote to me in June 1875. 
And now that you say in this letter, that you're going to give up your work on a telephone. - Let me see it.
Silence in the court, please.
Your honnor, Mrs. Bella just brought us the proof the defense has been asking for. 
Documentary evidence that Alexander
Bell discovered the undulating current on which his telephone is based, prior to June 1875.
Very well, Mr. Smith. If you have such evidence, presented it. 
I beg Your honors and dozens for just one moment.
I'd rather that letter weren't presented.
Alec. - Letter is something between you and me.
It's part of our personal lives.
- But Alec, that's your proof.
I'm sure there's nothing in this letter be ashamed of.
I'd rather not do it.
I regret to inform Your honor, 
Mr. Bell declines to submit the new evidence.
What did he say? - Alec won't let him present the letter. 
Alec... for the first, and if I hope... the only time in my life...
I'm going to disobey you.
It's my letter, and
I'm going to read it.
Mable. - I won't stand by and see you called a liar and a thief. 
But, fallen... - Alec, my eyes are closed. 
It's dated June the 11th 1875.
It was written to me by Mr. Bell before our marriage. 
Will you read it, please?
I beg you pardon?
- Will you read it, please?
My dearest one, I have loved you with a passionate attachment that you cannot understand. 
That is to me new and incompliant.
Ever since I held you in my arms and kissed your lips,
I have known what
I want most in life.
Without you I am nothing.
Without you I'm incomplete.
Because this is so I have decided to give up my telephone. 
This is little enough to do if it means that I will have your arms about me forever.
I may call you sweetheart
Why...
Go on, Mrs. Bell.
Please don't grieve at my decision.
The telephone will be born someday, somehow so far as I am concerned I do not care one bit who gets the glory.
So long as the world gets the benefit.
Though my heart... I am yours.
Thank You Mrs. Bell.
- Your honnor... may I suggest that this Court has not interested in the sentiments... however tenderly expressed that we've just heard.
What possible bearing has a love-letter on whether Bell invented the telephone or did not invent it?
That he is mention of a telephone does not mean that he made it telephone?
Mrs. Bell, what kind of paper is that letter written on? 
Why turn ordinary wrapping paper. 
What is that on the back of it?
Weights drawings if apparatus
Mr. Bell wanted for his telephone.
Together with a stamped acknowledgment from the Williams Electric Company. 
Acknowledging receipt of the order on... June 30th, 1875.
What is that writing?
Mr. Wiggins scribbled a note at the bottom the page asking Mr. Bell to stop in and verify his outline of an apparatus to generate an undulating current. 
It is all? You may step down, Mrs. Bell.
Thank you.
- Just a moment, Mrs. Bell.
Will you please tell us why
Mr. Bell sensual love letter is on the back of a sales memorandum? 
Why didn't he use note paper?
As any young man in love would be expected to do.
Mr. Bell was very poor man.
He had no other paper I wish to write. 
Thank you Mrs. Bell.
You may step down.
I offer this letter in evidence as exhibit 17 to the plaintiff.
Your Honor, I'm sure we've all been touched by this little excursion into romance... but now if we may compose ourselves...
I'd like to ask why if such a letter existed it wasn't produced days ago? 
And more particularly, why my learned colleague hasn't produced the man Williams in court to substantiate his signature?
Unfortunately, Mr. Williams is no longer available as a witness. 
Oh, really?
And why not?
Surely it would be worth your while to bring mr. Williams here.
Let us have a look at.
- Mr. Williams is dead.
Oh, he's dead.
How very unfortunate, Mr. Bell. 
Now very convenient.
Your honor... without my knowledge, and against my wishes my wife came into this courtroom... at a time like this... to read to you a letter intended for her eyes alone.
Have I committed some offense by starving in an attic by spending sleepless nights at my work... by being too poor to own a decent scrap of paper... on which to tell her of my love?
I have sat here for days and heard myself called liar... thief... fraud and cheat.
I've seen my friends humiliated... my invention belittled... just as I have seen my business destroyed by methods which must leave every honest man appalled.
Your honor, we protest against this interruption.
Yes. - You happen we had enough of this sentimental nonsense.
I demand that this man be declared in contempt of court.
Mr. Barrows, we're all here in the interest of truth.
And I don't think mr. Bell do that any great injury.
Sit down, Mr. Barrows.
Gentlemen, I am no longer fighting the battle of Alexander Graham Bell... inventor of the telephone.
That man however justice soon... does not matter here... the issue is bigger... bigger than the millions involved... and there are millions at stake.
Is your guilty cheeks already tell me...
- Your honor, we must protest protest.
Protest all you like, gentlemen.
I mean to say what I have to say. 
The time is coming when the telephone will be known in every home in the land... in every shop and factory... and beyond the seeds even to the remotest ends of the Earth. 
But that too is not the issue. 
The issue is simply this... shall the lonely scientist... the man who dreams... and out of his dreams benefits the world... is he that often half starved... lonely little man... to be told the world has no need of him the moment his work is done?
Your honnor.  - Your is he to be told in others.
Less gifted, but stronger.
Men with money and power behind them... are waiting to take the product of his genius and turn it to their own uses... leaving him with liar and thief branded on his brows is only reward.
Do that and you stop the clock of progress.
You smother the spark of genius that lies have you here and there throughout the world.
Do that, and the world stand still. - Your honor, 
I demand that this man be cited in contempt of court.
This case is under advisement.
- Mable, are you alright?
Alec. - We must get her out of here quickly.
Get on it. Get an ambulance quick.
Ambulance? Isn't one within 20 blocks of here.
They got a telephone, though if you know how to use it. 
Telephone?
Hold on, mother.
Show me where this quiz with. (?)
Watson, come here I want you.
Go get an ambulance quick.
Ahoy, ahoy this is
Alexander Graham Bell speaking.
I want an ambulance. Hurry
Watson. This fool thing will never work.
Oh a heart.
A heart!
BELL SUIT STILL
UNDER ADVISEMENT
Judge Rider Will Not Render Descision on Telephone Patent Case Until End of Month
Yes she is.
Jenny has a picture.
Look, I think she knows me.
I'm sure she does, dear.
Would you like to hold it?
Who, me? Oh, you... you know how clumsy I am.
Yes, I would.
There you are, my darling.
Be careful of her back.
You know, you haven't told me a word about the trial since I came home.
Well, I still have it under advisement.
Which probably means we've lost
Alec... would you mind so terribly.
Can't work and struggle and not care when it all goes for nothing.
Especially when there others involved.
Your father, Mr. Sanders, Watson. 
But... you know I've been thinking about something else.
Alec, Mabel your father,
 Mr. Sanderson ad Mr. Watson are here.
And someone else.
May the come in?
- Why, of course mama.
How's my little girl?
Alec, you know mr. Pollard?
I'm the president of the
Western Union. - How do you do?
My wife, and my daughter.
Mrs. Bell, we must apologize for coming here like this, but your father insisted.
- Go ahead. break it to them. 
Well, Mr. Bell the Western
Union is ready to admit that you and you alone invented the telephone. - What?
We will retire from the field and turn over to you the 56.000 telephones we now have in operation.
Alec. - The fact is, we made the mistake of accepting a false report from one of our engineers.
After your wife read your letter in court, we made a further investigation.
We found that this man braze will not only intended to deny your rights, but to injure us as well.
Mr. Bell were not only willing but anxious to pay for that mistake.
Of course, if you consider us... as partners, we could offer our wires rights away, improvements and other assets.
You could? - Or, shall we say one-fifth interest?
Well I don't know what to say.
I ought to warn you you have probably the most valuable single patent ever issued
Your stock we're selling in the New York exchange this morning for a 1.000 $ a share.
1.000 $? Well, what do you say Alec? 
Well I'll have to ask my wife.
Alec you know I never interfere with your business.
Gentlemen, I accept.
- Thank You Mr. Bell.
Yeah it's exactly 11 and a half minutes past 11:00.
Time for this young lady's lunch.
Goodbye my dear. - Papa.
Come gentlemen. - It's been a pleasure Mrs. Bell.
Goodbye Mrs. Bell.
- Goodbye.
Alec. Alec aren't you happy?
Everything you've wanted and worked for... and everything the world has to offer you.
Yes darling.
What... I want...
I want to tell you...
I been thinking about something else.
Yes? - The other day
I saw seagull... flying.
And there were... there was something about... about the curve of its wings.
It just occurred to me that if a bird that's heavier than air can fly... a man might fly too.
What did you say? -Iif a bird that's heavier than air can fly... a man might fly too.
A man fly?
- Yes!
When are you going to start work on him Mr. Bell?
I am sorry Gentlemen.
I realize this places you in an awkward position.
But I know these Comanche's.
Particularly I know Chief Stand Alone.
If he has made up his mind to fight,
He is going to fight.
- That is all there to it.
-We are sent here to talk peace with the Indians.
What are we to say to the president?
I can't take responsibility, of permitting you to go any further into Indian country.
Col! Our instructions from president clearly states that you will provide us with an army escort!
An escort?
You see that ridge over there.
The first one...
Our entire force couldn't move a mile beyond that without a pitch battle.
I don't think that you would be much use to the president without your scalps.
Sentry reports amount of force in Indian form.
Looks like an attack.
They two in front.
They look like white men.
Those Indians were escorts!
Hold your fire.
Howdy colonel!
- What's the meaning of this corporal?
Meet colonel Grant!
- How do you do colonel?
Who are you?
My name is Stanley.
I am a reporter for The New York Herald.
Newspaperman?
Didn't you know better that to take this...
Civilian into Indian territory?
I tried to talk him out of it. But he is so dead set on seeing the old chief...
- Chief San Tata?
- Yep!
You mean to say you saw chief san tata?
I am sorry I cannot tell you that.
Come on Jeff! We got to get the railroad and telegraph our story back to New York
Just a moment Mr. Stanley!
This is field head quarters for the United States army.
These two gentlemen are the
Presidents' peace commissioners.
You will oblige me by answering their questions.
- Sorry colonel! I cant do that.
- You cant? Or you wont?
Well if you want to put it that way colonel.
I wont.
Suppose I place you under arrest.
Maybe that will change your mind.
You can't arrest me colonel. I know my rights.
My paper sent me to get a story and I got it.
All of this is the exclusive property of our boss. James Bennet.
Presidents going to hear about this.
He will hear about, when everybody else does.
When he will read the New York Herald.
- Come on Jeff!
- Good day Colonel.
What's the matter? Roughness?
No, I take these to help me mind my own business
Just a moment gentlemen.
I have listened to you with patience.
Now, apparently you don't like the way
I run my paper.
But it's my paper and that's the way
I intend to run it.
I intend to feature in the Herald first and upto the minute news of sensational events.
And for your information senator, I intend to go on telling the truth
About graft and corruption in high places.
More prominent the rascal.
The bigger the news.
And furthermore gentlemen I intend to continue making news
While my competitor sit around waiting for it to happen.
Now suppose we get down to the business that brought you here.
You came to buy me out. Didn't you?
Well that is more or less what we planned to discuss with you.
And now if you would let us know your lowest price of the herald.
One-cent daily and 5 cents on Sundays.
What is it Albert?
- Mr. Stanley is here Sir!
- Well, show him in.
Hello Stanley! That was a great story.
- Thanks!
Welcome back!
Bennet is waiting to pin a leather medal on you.
Hello, Mr. Stanley!
-Well, how are you?
Say were those real Indians?
-It's the realest Indians that you ever saw.
Billy, I want you to meet Jeff Slogan.
The best Indian scout in whole Wyoming territory
Keep an eye on him for me but don't believe everything that he tells you
As a matter of fact Billy, don't believe anything that he tells you.
- Glad you are back Mr. Stanley!
-How are you?
Mr.Bennet's waiting for you.
Stanley! Glad to see you.
Sit down.
Another delegation from Boss Tweed still trying to buy me out.
How about letting me do a series on the graft sometime
The job you did in Wyoming. Great story.
Reaped the town with it. Reaped the whole country.
You happen to have a man Sloke still in your expense account.
He took care of me like a baby there.
I promised him a trip to New York.
If we came out with our hair where it should be. It's on you.
All right! All right! I am glad that you are still alive.
- Me too!
- Have a cigar!
- Thanks!
Stanley! What do you know about Livingstone?
- Living. You mean the new bar tender at Joe's?
- No, no, Dr. Livingstone. The missionary, explorer
- Dr. Livingstone.
Like to read a good newspaper once in a while.
Like the London Globe.
Read that. Just came over the Atlantic cable.
The London Globe's expedition to Africa to find Dr.Livingstone.
Has just returned to Zanzibar, the African interior.
Mr.Garreth Tyce the leader of the expedition
And son of the publisher has prostrated the tropical fever.
The expedition however reports that it has obtained positive truth That Dr. Livingstone is dead.
Well that settles the old boy.
If I can prove that Tyce is wrong about Dr. Livingstone..
I will make him a laughing stock of every newspaper office.
- Now get ready... you are going to Africa.
- What?
I will have that old fool on toast.
- Oh now, wait a minute! Wait a minute.
While you are having that old on toast what am I supposed to be doing?
- Finding Livingstone!
- Oh I see! Is that all?
You are not losing your nerve, are you?
-Now wait a minute Mr.Bennet...
I have got a little reputation of my own.
Where do I come off?
Suppose this old 'what's his name' is alive and I prove it..
Where is your reader's interest?
Where is your story?
You don't suppose that I will be sending you all the way to Africa, if there weren't any story?
For a whack at Tyce, you send me ... you know it
- Oh, no, forget about Tyce, he is nothing to me.
- It's the story I am interested in.
- Well where is it?
How many people have ever heard about Livingstone?
A great many more than you think.
Christians who believe in spreading the
Word of God, among the heathen.
Enemies of slavery, who know how a magnificent fight he is making against the slave traders.
How many of those people read The Herald?
In all the millions. The plain common
Everyday people, who derive excitement...
From reading the adventures of a heroic figure in the dark places of the earth.
There is your reader interest, Mr. Stanley.
Dr. Livingstone is a great adventurer.
One of the greatest. Come here.
I will show you something.
The Dark Continent.
Mystery, heat, fever, cannibals
A vast jungle in which
You can loose half of America.
A land in which even the greatest conquerors never dared to penetrate.
Alexander, Ceaser, The Pharos of Egypt.
None of them unchanged, untouched.
Since the dawn of history.
Somewhere, somewhere in there a grand old man, a man of God
Who has given his life to spreading his light in darkness.
There is your story!
A real story.
But if you don't think so...
Besides it would be extremely dangerous.
So perhaps its just better you forget about it.
Lets see. You said you wanted to do a series on Boss Tweed...
Harper's Weekly has a young artist named Thomas Nast.
Who has been doing some sensational cartoons
On the Tweed ring.. Better have a talk with him
Where was he heard of last?
- Who Tweed?    - Livingstone.
Somewhere in Tanganyika district.
You will find Nast up at Harper's.
- How long will it take to get there and back?
-Harpers?
-Tanganyika!
- Maybe a year two or three
You think it will make a great story?
I mean finding Livingstone.
The greatest story in the history of journalism.
If you get it.
- I will go.
- The steamer sails from London on Saturday.
I have already reserved passage for you.
Draw 5000 dollars now and when it's gone
Draw another 5000, and when it's gone draw another and another and another.
But find Livingstone.
- Suppose Tyce is right and Livingstone is dead?
Well then there is no story.
- I think there is.
I will bring him back on alcohol for new museum on 14th street.
Might call it green, might call it blue but doggone you just can't call it red.
- Howdy!
- Beg your pardon?
I just said howdy.
- Oh! How do you do!
- Is it always that color?
- What color?
- Well it ain't red!
- As a matter of fact it isn't.
I ain't seen you before.
When did you get on board?
I came about last night on Suez.
- You live in this part of the country?
Beg your pardon!
- I said, you live down in this part of country?
- No my home is in London.
-London! That's where those Englishmen come from. Ain't it?           -I am afraid so.
- Hello! There Stan! Where have you been?
I want to introduce you to my young friend Mr. Stanley. This is.. Mr..Mr..
I didn't quite catch your name partner!
- It's Tyce. How do you do!
Did he said Tyce?
- Well I thought that he said
Jeff! If Mr.Tyce is who I think he is
Then I am going to raise your salary.
Mosey around at the back.
-Beautiful weather. Isn't it?
- Yes! It's delightful.    - A little hot.
Is that the London Globe? Well.. Well..
Do you mind if I look at this?
- No of course not.
- Thank you.
I will be lost without my Globe!
- You read the Globe. Do you?
- Religiously!
- Quite a good paper don't you think?
- Finest in the world of its kind.
- But you are an American aren't you?
- Yes. Quite a large percentage of Americans read.
- Really! You don't say so.
I guess you don't remember me!
Stanley... Henry. M. Stanley.
Yes! We just met. I am the publisher of The Globe you know.
- Really! Well you certainly should be proud of it.
- Thank you. Thank you..
- Why don't you sit down?
- Yes. Thanks. Thanks...
This expedition of yours to find
Dr.Livingstone
Few publishers would have had the courage and the editorial shrewdness to attempt it.
Yes! We like to be progressive in life.
My son you know led the expedition.
He is desperately ill ever since. Poor lad!
I am on my way to Zanzibar to bring him home.
At least his illness wasn't in vain. Since he solved
The mystery of Dr.Livingdston's disappearance.
- Then your son did find him?
- Well ... virtually. It won't incline to split hairs...
He didn't actually find the grave. But he did
Interview people who were present at his death.
You mean he took their word for it, that
Dr.Livingstone is dead?
- Well yes. Why do you ask?
- Well. I was wondering if...
There were any more evidence of his death than that had already appeared in The Globe?
It's not our policy to withhold news from public.
The Globe prints all the facts & nothing but the facts.
- Even when all of them are rumors.
- Rumors? What do you mean rumors?
Well I mean. The evidence like that will hardly hold in the court of law.
- Are you a lawyer?
- No.. no.. I am a newspaperman.
- A newspaperman!
- Yes, I am a reporter at New York Herald.
For Bennet! That sensational mongrel with his pushy Yankee ride?
Would you mind telling me Sir, what are you doing here on your way to Zanzibar?
Well no...Mr.Bennet has send me to try to find Dr.Livingstone.
Lord Tyce! ... You forgot your paper.
- Got a matchstick?
- Yeah1
This isn't any different color from Mother Ocean.
Made no difference for me then
Nice and quiet now, but I get a feeling that I ain't going to enjoy this trip.
Jeff, I have a got a hunch better than any.
Globes story about Livingstone death is nothing but a trumped up lie from start to finish.
Some people just ain't got any respect for the truth.
Now son, if you will excuse me.
I have got some business.
Missy! Missy!
Yes, what is it?
- Big ship... she come.
- Send the carriage to the dock immediately.
- Father! The boat is in.
- Splendid... splendid.
Darling do be a dear and change your clothes and be brushed up before Lord Tyce gets here.
-Who my dear?
- Lord Tyce.
- We are expecting him, aren't we?
- Yes. And you must make a good appearance.
After all while the counselor is away.
You are the representative of Her Majesty's govt.
Yes, yes my dear...
To be sure I am, I will wear my uniform
Father your uniform is appropriate when you are in China.
But I have your other suit all washed and ironed.
That would be so much better.
- Yes. Yes. My dear. You are right. Quite right.
- All right now. Come along and please hurry.
The ship is already in. I have send the coach for your father.
- Good
- Did you take your quinine?
Is that all you have to say to me.
While it is almost an hour since I have seen you?
-Did you take your quinine?
- No!
- Must you leave everything for me to think off?
I was reading and the time slipped by.
Gareeth, do you think your father will be able to have us transferred back home?
No question he has the influence.. but a tough old bird is the Governor.
Doesn't believe in doing any favors. He expects everybody to be aggressive & self-reliant as he is.
That's why I am in such a constant trial.
- I am frightened to death of him already
- You needn't be.
He wont be able to resist you.
As if anyone could.
I beg your pardon!
Is this Mr.Kingsley's house?
I have some business with him.
Are you Mrs.Kingsley?
- Miss Kingsley.
- I am Stanley. I am a reporter at New York Herald
- I see. Mr. Stanley,
Could you possibly come tomorrow instead?
I could possibly. But I would like to see him tonight.
- We are dining here.
- I envy you.
- We have guests here... excuse me.
- Oh! Here you are. Pls help me tie this tie.
- Father you promised you would wear white suit.
- Oh yes. Of course I am.
- Goodnight Miss Stanley. I am sorry if
I have disturbed you.
Oh! There is someone at the door.
- How do you do!
- How do you do Sir!
This is Mr. Stanley. He has business with you but I told him that you are dining..
Oh of course of course. Delighted to have you
Any friend of Eve is welcome.
By all means stay and dine with us.
Happy to have you.
Well thank you! It's very kind of you.
If you wish to stay Mr. Stanley you are welcome.
Did you remember to open the wine?
The wine? Oh! Yes, yes. I will see to it at once.
You will make Mr. Stanley at home. Wont you!
Perhaps you better come in and meet the other guests.
And once we get out of this abominable climate just as soon as possible.
This is Mr. Stanley. Lord Tyce.
- Yes I already had the pleasure of meeting him.
- And Mr.Tyce.. Mr. Stanley.
- How do you do!
Lord Tyce and I had a very interesting chat on the boat coming down.
This is the gentleman who as good as insinuated that we are both liars.
Come father! What you told me the worst
Mr. Stanley thinks we are poor newspapermen.
So you intend to have a whack at it yourself?
- Certainly. Why not!
- I wish you luck.
- Thank you.
- I hope you don't have to be carried out.
- That's a stupid waste of time and money.
Why should we worry about Bennet money?
I have got nothing but a...
Well, well, well! Here we are.
I see you all know each other.
Mr.Tyce led the expedition to find Dr.Livingstone.
- Mr. Stanley is here for the same purpose.
Oh really! Bless my soul. Splendid. Splendid.
I knew the Doctor well, very well.
Great man! Of course you know this was his house. He lived here.
He still lives here. ...
You know so many things he brought back.
I am sure you all are starving.
We are dining in the garden.
Lord Tyce! You haven't eaten anything.
Can I get you something else?
Mr. Stanley, may I enquire, where the idea originated of this wild goose chase in Africa?
It was Bennett's idea. I think he got it from the London Globe.
I thought so. I knew it.
Another of his cheap Yankee tricks.
The man who finds Dr.Livingstone, will be doing a great service to the world.
I am glad you said that Mr.Kingsley!
Because I need your help.
I would like to get a pass to go to the island of Pimply
I understand while the councilor is away
You are the man giving one.
They say Pimply is unhealthy for white men.
- I will take my chances on that. -
- How about it Mr.Kingsley?
- What?
- The pass... to Pimply!
- Oh yes, yes yes. By all means.
- I shall be happy to provide you with a pass.
- May I remind you.
You forgive me for intruding Mr.Kingsley.
But it seems to me
That you are taking you on an extremely grave responsibility.
Mr. Stanley is not a British subject... and if anything unpleasant should happen to him
Mr.Bennet, his employer is quite capable of asking embarrassing questions of the foreign office.
Thank you Lord Tyce.
I appreciate your concern.
I relieve you of all responsibility Mr.Kingsley.
Well in that case their cant be any possible objection.
- Father Mr. Stanley is a newcomer here.
He knows nothing about Pimply or its dangers.
If anything would happen to him you would still be responsible.
Oh yes! You are right. I think it's a matter for the councilor himself to decide...
- But Mr.Kingsley...
- No, no no my boy! Eve is right.
When the councilor returns
I will put in a good word for you.
Thank you Miss Kingsley. It was nice of you to take in a poor fellow and treat him so gently.
My respects to your father and the guests...
I would just go out this way.
Thank you again for your help.
A pass would have meant a great deal to me.
Mr. Stanley!
I am sorry if I have ruined your plans.
- You have plans of your own Miss Kingsley.
I had to do it to please Lord Tyce.
It's desperately urgent. About my father.
What's your father has got to do with this?
- I simply got to get him back to England.
- Why?
You have seen him. You have talked with him.
You know how he is.
I didn't see anything unusual for a man of his age. of his age? He is barely fifty.
Africa has done this to him.
It's killing him
Just as it killed my mother.
And the cruel pitiful thing about it is.
He still thinks he loves the place.
He doesn't want to leave it. It's in his blood.
Just as it was with Livingstone and all the rest.
That's what I meant when I said
Livingstone still lives here.
There is never a moment when his shadow is not over this house.
I know what he has done. He is a humanitarian.
But everybody can't follow in his footsteps.
And look at father... it has only made him sick...and made none happy.
I must get him away before its too late.
I am sorry. If I knew I wouldn't have butted in.
Don't worry about the pass. I will get along.
- Stan!
- Where have you been?
I was with everything from
Jackass to wagon train
But never had no such trouble with
Half of these Janzabarians...
All right, lets shove off
- Mr. Stanley.
- Wait a minute
- Are you completely out of your mind?
- Maybe, why?
You are going to Pimperley without a pass.
- That's where the slave buyers go. Isn't it?
Yes. But not white men. They hate the white
For trying to stop the slave trade.
And worst of all they hate Dr.Livingstone.
If they were ever to find out the information that you are after
What else did Lord Tyce asked you to say.
I am sorry, I am sorry.
I didn't mean that.
You are not the kind to do anybody's dirty work.
I realize you are trying to help me and I appreciate.
But I guess you better save your advice for somebody who has sense enough to take it.
I knew when you left me last night that you are that kind of fool
Sure. I admit it.
It didn't mean it as a compliment
I guess I am just another kind.
But if anything happens to you.
Don't hold my father responsible.
See now... black beads for. Egg beads for
Uguha. But they are not worth anything in Ufifa.
And of course brass wire and cheap cloth
Mirrors are as good as gold or anything.
Well that's all. No. No.
There is something I wanted to tell you
A letter for Dr.Livingstone and please give him my warmest regards.
That's true. I don't know where he is now.
Or even if he is still alive
Oh! And Eve said she wants to see you.
She is out in the garden
Speaking of howling savages. I remember once up in the Dakota bad land back in 58.
58! Really I remember the year well.
Let me see now. Was it 59
No that's right 58... I was making a short journey up in search of geological specimen
On the third day I began to hear war drum.
We were being pursued by large war parties.
Several tribes... their witch doctor said that
We were first class devils
I could hear them howling now. Whooo!
So you are really going?
-Yes. Thanks to you for getting me that pass.
- I wish I had never given it to you
- Why?
Because I don't want the credit for what's going to happen to you
Nothings going to happen to me.
You don't realize what's ahead of you.
Do you want to come back like all the others?
Broken.. Old before the time.
Shattered by something far too big for any of us to conquer.
Do you think you can fight Africa alone?
And win?
I guess I better make myself clear.
Conquering Africa alone or with help doesn't interest me least.
I am no explorer and I am certainly no missionary.
I am not crazy about the idea of spending the next couple of years of my life
Scouring for an old missionary with a Bible on one hand and a bag of beans on the other.
But if Livingstone alive I am going to find him.
That's my assignment.
I have got my reasons to want to fulfill it.
It is nice to know that you care of what happens to me.
- Wish me luck
- I do with all my heart.
- I wont forget that.
- Make way for her majesty's force marine
- Oh Garetth! That's wonderful
- Well how does it seem walking again?
It gives me an earnest desire to sit down.
So you are really going eh!
You should have heard the Governor
When he learned that you are about ready to start.
He thinks that you are trying to blast the foundations of British Journalism.
- He would soon think of blowing up West Ministers abbey.
- Oh! You needn't explain it to me.
I am not a journalist and I have already proved that I am not an explorer.
When I was in school in Switzerland I climbed
A matador to win a 5-pound bet.
Which gave my father the brilliant idea that I was just the man
To scour the wilds of Africa for
Dr.Livingstone.
When are you leaving?
-Tomorrow morning from the mainland
- I wish you luck!
- I guess this is goodbye.
I will write to you.
Where you are going you will find quite a scarcity of post offices.
Well all right. I will deliver the letters personally when I come back.
Oh I see! Well if she isn't here
I suggest you try London.
All right I will. I hope that everything turns out the way you wanted for your father.
And by that time there were only 10 of us left.
And 6 of those were so weak from fever
That they could hardly stand... the tribes were closing in..
And when we camped that night we were completely surrounded.
- Oh! Must you be going?
- Yes! We will be moving to mainland tonight.
Have you engaged all the bearers you need? .
- The American Consulate at Bargepole has taken care of that.
Mr.Kingsley, I wish I could ell you how much
I appreciate all you have done for me.
Not at all Sir! Not at all.
I wish I could go with you.
But they tell me that I am not quite up to for the trip through the jungle now.
There is nothing to match it son. nothing to match it.
Evenings in the camp.
The breeze cool of the plateau.
A tropical river gleaming like silver in moonlight. and the feeling of life around you everywhere.
And more than anything else the knowledge that you are that you are thousands of miles away from the civilization..
As close to nature as God made it.
Well goodbye Mr. Stanley and good luck.
- Goodbye to you Sir!
- Goodbye.
- Are we following his advice?
- Of course. He is an experienced explorer.
I know nothing about his exploring but
He sure is experienced in telling warpaths.
5 days out. Weather clear but hot
Easing march in the country.
We have been climbing steadily ever since we left the coast
And the coolness of the night proves that we have already reached considerable elevation.
Ahead lies the great plateau of
Equatorial Africa. A vast area of open country.
We are the first to enter if from the point so far from the south.
We are carrying what in here in Africa
What amounts to a small fortune in trade goods.
We are hoping to conserve our food supplies as much as possible by living of the country
Water is no the problem.
This morning we saw our first game a small herd of antelope.
Although we have ran across no dangerous animals during the day.
Their tracks are everywhere
And in the night we have heard the lions hunting close to our camps. setting up a great coughing but apparently afraid of our fires.
Our guide tells us that they will only attack men when starving.
So we have little to fear from them in this land of plenty.
I would call this hunter's paradise.
The valleys are alive with antelope other game.
Including some new species that are not yet been listed by the Naturalists.
Lately we have begun to see giraffes.
Although Mr.Slokan claims that are no such animal.
Kingsley was right when he said that
There was nothing to match it.
This is no empty wilderness but swamping with life.
What old P.T.Barna will give to these specimens.
This is the greatest show on Earth.
I am afraid Miss Kingsley was inclined to exaggerate the dangers of the journey.
We have quite days and peaceful nights in camp.
Way up on a high hill with a cliff thousand feet down.. Tell them that.
Here was 500 Comanche's.
- Say.. You sure you are telling this exactly right?
- Yes Merci!
The 1000 Comanche's...
Coming closer, closer and closer...
How you say scalping in your lingo?
Now tell them that Injuns were trying to get mine.
All the Comanche's skiddale like billy blue here.
- What are they saying?
- They are saying you the biggest liar in Africa.
I had always thought of Africa in terms of jungles and swarming heat
But this open mountainous country is little different from our own great west.
Only the profusion of game. Only insects occasional strange tropical growth
Reminds us that we are approaching the heart of the Dark Continent.
Today we reached 'Chicago'
A well-populated region inhabited by
A thick chested bumptious tribe.
Who introduced us to the ancient African custom of Honga... Honga means tribute. beads cloth and wire. Grafts from the chief of all caravans passing through his territory.
Apparently the spoiled system is well established in Africa as in New York.
But the local boss treat us as a friendly group
And willing to provide us with food and guide for the next stage of our journey.
At just double the regular price.
Merci! He say that he know where the white man is.
- Where?
- In village Mombassa, two moon march.
Tell the men to start packing.
Find out all he knows.
We have been making rapid progress on the last two marches.
Gaining new strength and belief that our search is nearing an end.
In only a few weeks I should be back in Zanzibar.
I wondered whether Miss. Kingsley will be surprised to see me.
I wish she was here.
I am sure the beauties of this vast country will take away all her fears of Africa.
Thousands of flamingoes flying off towards the sunset
An omen for our success.
I find myself thinking of her often.
At last the village.
What would Dr.Livingstone be like?
White man is in there.
I don't know what to say. What do you say when you meet people in the middle of Africa?
Well you just say howdy partner.
How are things?
He is not white man.
He is Alvano.
- Lets get out of here.
- You mean he is black white man.
No. He is a white black man.
Our disappointment at Mbashi was apparently the signal for our luck to turn against us.
Last night another man was carried off by a lion and 2 more died of dysentery.
Our worst enemy.. When it strikes the men drop like flies.
The vultures follow us expectantly.
Our men are beginning to desert.
Poor devils! I wondered whether they will ever reach the coast alive.
We tramped on day after day.
Week after week .. from village to village.
Endlessly questioning. endlessly receiving the same answer 'not know' 'not know'.
It is so long since we have heard a single word of hope
That now even a false rumor will be welcome.
I am beginning to get some conception about the immensity of this country.
It is as if we have left New York on foot, hoping to find Livingstone
Somewhere between
Chicago and New Orleans.
We haven't seen any human being and savage life was all around us.
The fierce equatorial Sun was always above our heads.
I apologize to Eve Kingsley
I thought she was wrong but she wasn't.
I wonder why she was so anxious to help me.
Me a stranger who is never anything but a nuisance to her. She tried to save me..
I wonder why.. Maybe because she knew that
White men don't belong in this country.
Livingstone must be crazy. If he is alive and that I am beginning to doubt.
But I must never confess my doubt. I don't want the men to know I am getting discouraged.
They call me "Buno Nwathare' which means breaker of the path.
I will not betray their confidence in me.
Today we saw our first human beings in over 3 months.
- Slave caravan
- Them slaves?
You and Hasan stay with the men.
How do you do? Speak English?
Hasan!
He says he is surprised that there is
White men in this country.
Ask him if he knows the way to Tanganyika.
He says he just come from there.
A place they call Yum Yumbe. 4 moon nights.
He says the only best way to go there is to go through the Yum Yumbe valley.
Ask him if he saw another white man?
He said he never seen before white men in this country.
Give him my thanks and go back to the men.
That's a funny lingo.
I never heard that before.
- War drums. What they are going to gain from us?
- Figure it out for yourself.
That slavers caravan passed through this country.
- Maybe they are pow wow
- Maybe.
They are up there somewhere.
Lets take them on the far side.
Come on son.. Don't stand here in the open.
This isn't Injun fighting.
If we can only tell them that we come in peace.
Look there must be millions of them.
Should anyone ever find this diary take it to
Mr. James Gordon Bennet of the New York Herald.
Tell him that the story is written in blood of the men I am leading to their deaths. and say to Miss. Kingsley that there is a message in these pages for her alone to read.
I never should have left her. Now it is too late
When I know that I will never see her again.
I can't go back. While I can walk, I am going on and I will not leave Africa without Livingstone.
Hasan! What's the matter with the men?
- They say they stay here.. Won't go no further.
Are they crazy?
- They say they stay here and will not die.
Say that if they stay here they will die quicker there is fever here.
- Yes Master?
- Who are these men?
Native from Tanganyika. They are hunters.
- Tanganyika.. Tanganyika..
Yes Master. They want food, they are hungry and the other white man always give them food.
- Other white man... when? Where?
- In Yugigi.
What's white mans name?
Doctor...
- Dr.Livingstone...
Give them food.. Give them whatever they wanted if they guide me to Yugigi.
You stay here with sick ones until I send for you or come back. I push on with few men.
- Tomorrow.
- Now.
Our guide say that this is Tanganyika, this village Yugigi.
Livingstone's hiding place for which we have searched so long.
It's hard to believe. I am afraid it is only a feverish mirage, that will vanish before my eyes.
After all these months of disappointment, can I dare believe that I have won?
The next few moments will give me the answer.
Dr.Livingstone.. I presume.
- Yes.
Thank God doctor.
I have waited to see you.
I am thankful that I am here to welcome you Mr...
- Stanley..
You are not well Mr. Stanley
Come in.
I have had fever
I have been traveling day and night since I found out that you are here.
It's over a year since we left Zanzibar.
Sit down.
Then it isn't merely luck that you came.
No. No. I came to find you Doctor.
We have a guest for our dinner.
Set another place.
So long since I entertained that I...
Nothing short of a banquet can do justice
This is an occasion. We will have that patted pig for dinner.
You come from Zanzibar you say.
Now tell me Mr. Stanley, were you are sent by
The govt or The Royal Geographical society.
Neither I was sent by the
New York Herald.
- Newspaper?
- You are front-page news Doctor!
The whole world has been wondering of what became of you.
There are dozen rumors about your death, even that you have married a native princess.
We will settle all those rumors
When I take you back... and alive.
Then the only reason that you are sent here is to get news for your paper.
That's right Doctor.
- How can I help you?
We want the exclusive right to publish all your signed articles. Naturally we will pay you
When we are through building you up
You will be a sensation, a hero in 3 continents.
Of course you will make your own engagements.
Lectures, appearances.  Whatever you like.
I am little ungrateful. You see that I am neither lost and nor am I hiding..
If I had intended to go back
I should have done it a long time ago.
I have no intention of leaving Africa until my work here is finished.
I know how you must feel after
Undergoing such hardships to discover
That the man you are sent to rescue has no desire to be rescued.
But you see.. I have been disappointed too.
I thought that you have been sent out to help me.
No matter I mustn't quarrel with the good fortune that brought you here.
For the blessings and the bounties though have placed upon this table
Lord make me.. make us .. truly grateful.
What are you doing there?
Come on.. What did you take?
Give it to me.
What has happened Mr. Stanley?
- I caught him going through my baggage.
- Did you strike him?
- Yes. Of course.
You shouldn't have done that Mr. Stanley.
Mongo! You promised you would stop stealing.
Mongo says, that he is sorry and asks your pardon Mr. Stanley.
Forgive me for speaking to you so sharply you should never strike these simple people.
They respond in kind to the treatment they receive.
They know enough brutality without white men teaching them more.
Mongo is making excellent progress. His good behavior used to be a matter of days.
Now he can go almost a whole month without backsliding.
I am sorry that you were inconvenienced.
Goodnight Mr. Stanley.
Splendid. Splendid.
Good morning Mr. Stanley.
- Good morning Doctor
- I hope our prayer didn't disturb you.
No. Oh no. I enjoyed it.
I have send escorts for the rest of your caravan.
- Thank you.
When you want your breakfast
Just call Juma.
Well. Well. Well. What's this?
-Susie..
-Yes master
- Susie.. Fetch medicine box. lets have a look at it.
- Juma plenty of hot water.
- Yes master.
Where did you find a big thorn like that?
The other side Susie.
- Would you mind lending a little moral support?
- Gladly.
Hombre here is a soldier but here he has got a thorn on his foot.
It's gone pretty deep.
Even a soldier needs a little encouragement.
We will give all the support we got.
What can I do to help?
I think it would be better if you hold his hands. there is nothing to be afraid of.
Mr. Stanley is our friend.
Hombre is not used to strangers.
Are you Hombre?
You see in the language of his tribe stranger and enemy are the same words.
We ran out of carbolic two years ago.
We have found that the bark of one of our native...
... The bark of one of our native trees has remarkable healing qualities.
We haven't had one case of infection since we used it.
Now then.. Lets see what we have got here.
There all of it. Good boy Hombre.
Good boy.. Nice and clean.
Disinfectant!
Hombre is in splendid physical condition.
His father was a Manyewa cannibal.
If Hombre hadn't come to live here his teeth would have been plowed by now.
They are fine people the Maniyeea in many ways.
Has strict sense of honor.
Magnificent physical specimens.
They have a great capacity of leadership.
Some day Hombre will be a great leader.
Teacher...
Now keep the bandage on or you will get dirt on the wound.
Very proud of Homber.
He has real talent.
What I have seen of Africa
I say you got a job in your hand.
It's the same in all countries. How do you suppose America looked to the first settlers
Who saw it as unknown wilderness steaming with hostile savages. That's the trouble here in Africa.
Susie.. Bring my map case.
- Yes master.
White men have seen Africa only through the eyes of ignorance.
That means through the eyes of fear.
You are a newspaperman Mr. Stanley.
You know something of human nature.
I may be in the mark up to learn something more.
- What keeps the white men away from Africa?
- Lot of things I guess.
- Fear. ... Fear of the unknown.
Fear of a blank space on the map. Fill in the blank space, drive away that fear
Let me show you.
This is the watershed for the whole continent. from here spring the great rivers
That find their way to the Atlantic, the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean. solve the mystery of those rivers the Congo and the rest
Above all solve the mystery of the source of Nile which puzzled the geographers
Since the time of Ptolemy. and you drive away the clouds of ignorance and fear.
Give the world  ... an honest. Accurate
Map of Africa.
It is no longer the Dark Continent.
Then others will come...
Not only the missionaries
Doctors, teachers, pioneers...
They will bring civilization drive away the slave traders.
Spread word of brotherhood of man in the continent.
Which never before in all its history has heard one single syllable of kindness or hope.
Well I must say Dr.Livingstone you are not exactly my idea of a missionary.
Mine is a much malign profession
It is possible you know to serve ones god without entirely loosing one's human perspective.
Now if you will excuse me, its time for Sunday school.
I have persuaded Dr.Livingstone to take me with him on a visiting trip around what he calls his parish.
This is undoubtedly the largest parish
In the world, including as it does some
Thousands of square miles.
The Doctor is remarkable...
Not only does he care about
For the souls and bodies of the people of the villages where we stop
But he takes a keen interest in natural history.
Classifying the flora and fauna we come across.
Yesterday we found a new and beautiful kind of bird whom we named Eve Kingsley.
After the daughter of the Doctors old friend. also we have made several side trips and explorations
His eternal quest of filling those blank spaces on the map.
There! Now we know for certain that the Ujiji river runs into lake Tanganyika
- The lion is getting mighty inquisitive
- He won't come near as long the fire is burning.
Guess I go and make sure that it is burning good and dry
- Are we moving out in the morning?
- Yes.
The rumors of an Arab slave raid around the Unandu Territory. To the north.
- Doctor!
- It is just the current fever.
Jeff! Come on lie down a little.
Get some quinine Jeff, quick.
You have quinine?
- Yes! Yes!
My supply ran out a year ago.
You never told me you had fever.
I haven't had an attack for some months now.
I suppose it's in the bones.
Well I know one thing Doctor. When I am leaving Africa you are going with me.
No my son. If I left here
I shall never come back.
This is my life, my work.
I shall stay here until I die.
We are returning to Yujiji. Never in my life have I known a man so uncomplaining.
Even though he has fever, he is already planning his next expedition.
His next achievement. I thank God
I have been permitted to know him.
Weeks have passed quickly. Too quickly.
But all good things must come to an end.
Tomorrow Jeff and I are leaving on our return journey to our coast and all of Ujiji has turned up for a farewell party on our honor.
If we are leaving in the dawn we better be getting a shown eye. don't you think..
I have the letters for you and one for Mr.Bennet as well.
Thank you Doctor.
You know Doctor, I was thinking what a great story it would make
Doctor Livingstone discovers the source of Nile.
New York Herald expedition was with him.
You mean you will go to Lualabi with me?
- I would have if you had me.
I should be proud to have you.
You aren't planning to go to
Lualabu river.. Are you?
When can we start?
- In about six months.
- Six months!
- We can't start until the rainy season is over.
After all my son, the river has been there for thousands of centuries
And it is not likely to run away from us.
No.. But I am afraid if we are stalled for
6 months by the time we get back
Bennet will have another expedition looking for me.
But you can help if you want to.
You know what I am trying to do here.
When you write your story about how you found me here, write mine too. Be my voice.
Tell them that I need assistants.
Tell them that I need medicine.
Supplies and even geographers if it is possible.
Tell them how much work is to be done.
- Will you do that?
- Of course Doctor.
This time I know that my message will go through.
I have found myself grating in the farewell.
That sorrowful word. 'We are parting'.
I to civilization. He to his lone battle against incredible danger and hardships
Weak as he his, he thinks only of his duty and dream.
With nothing to sustain him but his own high spirit and
His enduring faith in God. Who he believes will bring all things right at last.
My guides will take you as far as Yumyum
From there you follow the watershed keeping the mountain onto your left
Till you strike the main trade route.
You should reach Zanzibar in one fifth of time that it took you to come in.
- I am counting on you my son.
- I will do my best sir. I promise you that.
I leave it with you.
May God bring you to safety.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye Doctor.
Oh Doctor! I almost forgot. Would you give this to Bongo, if you think he would like it.
I am sure he will be most grateful.
Thank You.
- Henry M. Stanley?
- Looks like there is someone to meet you son.
She must have got my cablegram
Are you Mr. Stanley?
- Yes.
- Cablegram for you.
- Thank you.
There she is. Come on.
Gentlemen I will give you my story later.
Here talk to Mr. Jeff.
Jeff! Look after the baggage.
Eve.. I beg your pardon
I mean Miss Kingsley.
I beg your pardon old man.
You mean Mrs.Tyce.
Congratulations! I knew you would do it.
- Thanks.
- What have you done about your luggage?
- Jeff's looking at it.
You get inside and talk to Eve
I will help him.
We are putting you up here you know.
- Well I am glad to see you back.
- I am glad to be back.
How stupid of me.. I forgot to congratulate Garreth.
Well then congratulate me.
- I wish you all the happiness in the world.
- Are you going to be in England long?
- No. Just long enough to take care some business.
For Doctor Livingstone
- Oh you say that so casually.
Isn't it the most wonderful thing that ever happened, finding him.
But Garreth and I were sure that you wouldn't fail.
I had help.
At times when I nearly turned back.
Something, I can't explain you what it was.
Something kept me going ahead. It was an inspiration that never failed me.
You have changed. I was wondering what is it about you, that reminded me of someone
Now I know who it is.
Its doctor Livingstone.
Doctor Livingstone?
- Yes.
You have that same look about you.
No I am afraid that you are imagining things.
I haven't changed.
I am still a reporter waiting for his next assignment.
Let me handle this. There is nothing I enjoy more than a whack at the seats of mighty.
- Sir Oliver!   - Yes! Oh Yes! Tyce..
- Forgive me for intruding Sir!
But I feel that this is truly a historic moment.
Sir Oliver French, I have the great honor to present the man who found Dr.Livingstone.
- Mr. Stanley I presume.
- Yes Sir! I am Stanley.
Mr. Stanley, this is Mr. Veil.
- How do you do sir!
Permit me to congratulate you upon your incredible accomplishment.
Incredible perhaps, but none the less accomplished.
If we seem a bit hesitant to accept Mr. Stanley's story in face value, please don't...
- I know you want the proof. Mr. Stanley has it.
- Has he?
-Mr. Stanley!
- Lord Tyce!
Did I understand that my son to say that you have proof that you found Dr.Livingstone?
Yes Sir. I have the documents here.
Dr.Livingstone instructed me to give you these Sir.
- An imposing mass of evidence I must say.
- If it was compiled by Dr.Livingstone.
-Oh father, for heavens sake be reasonable.
- I be glad to accept the judgment of the society.
- Well nothing can be fairer than that.
Very well Mr. Stanley. I will appoint a committee to examine these documents
And instruct them to make their reports at our next general meeting at Brighton.
-Thank you Sir.
- I am certain that the meeting will be 
Long remembered by all of us.
- I am certain it will. and I have here one of the letters Dr.Livingstone have supposed to entrust to Mr. Stanley and here is a letter which I personally know was written by Dr.Livingstone some 15 yrs ago when he was in England. I have carefully
compared and in all honesty I cannot conclude that they were written by the same hand.
Would you say Mr.Kringsten that they were written by two different hands?
Yes. I should say so.
But can't we assume that the trembling hand
of an old man, wracked with fever would produce a different character of writing than composed by a man in his prime. as Dr.Livingstone was 15 years ago.
- That's an assumption Sir. Not proof.
And now gentlemen the maps which Mr. Stanley claims, were drawn by Dr.Livingstone have been examined by the expert 
Cartographer Mr. Fredric Holkham.
As to the other maps of this unexplored territory and of which to compare these
Naturally I cannot accept them as correct.
Mr. Chairman!  .... - Mr.Kingsley!
- By the same reasoning
Mr.Holkham could not possibly have accepted the maps of Christopher Columbus.
Isn't it true Mr.Holkham that those maps could have been drawn as well or as poorly by a child who have never been 10 miles from London?
That's putting it rather strongly Lord Tyce.
Would you say that the rivers and mountains so generously indicated on those maps. might not exist outside of 
Mr. Stanley's imagination?
No I shouldn't care put myself in position saying they are purely pigment of Stanley's imagination.
But there is 1 point of fact, or of error that should certainly cause us to question these records.
Here is a river called the Lualava river indicated as flowing North and being the true source of Nile.
And further gentlemen...
Indicated as being at an elevation of 2000 ft above sea level. ... 2000 feet!
As we all know our eminent colleague Mr.Hantton measured the elevation of the Nile as 2169 ft.
Therefore it seems that if we are to believe these records that we must also believe, that water could flow over 700 miles uphill.
Dr.Livingstone indicated the Lualava as possible and not the actual source of the Nile.
The word possible Mr. Stanley does not appear on the maps.
Dr.Livingstone said it was possible
That it is not the Nile but the Congo.
And as to that Mr. Stanley, even an elementary knowledge of Geography should tell you
That the Congo flows not North but West.
Mr. Chairman, assuming that anybody found
Anybody, is it not likely that Stanley
Did not discover Livingstone but that
Livingstone discovered Stanley.
It must be obvious to even the most gullible of us that Mr. Stanley has attempted to make this honorable gathering
The victim of a colossal fraud.
You ought to know about fraud you old Rhinosausarus.
It was my privilege to spend some time with Mr. Stanley at Zanzibar. where I gone to meet my son, who courageously led, a bona-fide expedition to find Dr.Livingstone.
When I told Mr. Stanley that Dr.Livingstone was dead, he refused to believe me.
Why I ask you. Why?
Because it wasn't true.
Wasn't it because that 'The London Globe' had stolen a march on the 'New York Herald'. or is it because Mr. Stanley had come
11,000 miles for a story and couldn't find one.
Gentlemen. Among unscrupulous publishers, the method is as old as a newspaper business itself
If you can't find a story, you hide yourself away with pen and paper and you make one.
I have before me a copy of 'New York Herald'.
With your kind indulgence
I will read a small portion of an editorial appearing in it.
.. And I intend to continue making news while my competitors sit around waiting it to happen.
That editorial gentlemen is signed by Mr. James
Gordon Bennet, publisher of the 'New York Herald'.
An employer of Mr. Henry. M. Stanley.
Do you have anything further to say Mr. Stanley?
Before this meeting votes on your report.
- Go on. Get up and give it to them.
- You must please.
Mr. Chairman. And I feel that I should say
Gentlemen of the jury
Since you have seen fit to turn this hearing into a trial
I stand before you accused of being a cheat a liar and a forger.
Unfortunately gentlemen, when you question my integrity
You nullify at the same time the discoveries of Dr.Livingstone.
And you condemn a great man to oblivion
A great man, whom this honorable gathering seem determined to wipe out with a vote. although today he is still roaming the jungle and swamp, alone and fevering. accomplishing more in every single day than you and your combined lives will ever accomplish.
You arm chaired Geographers, who have never explored anything deeper than a plump pudding
I realize that this hall is charged with prejudice
And to raise my voice here is to cry out in the wilderness.
But I would be violating a sacred trust if I did not cry out.
Even though only the walls heard me.
The walls of a handful of faithful friends.
Gentlemen, I do not like to think that I am expecting too much when I ask tolerance and fair play from my fellow countrymen.
Yes. I was born in England. went to school here, not Eton, Herald but workhouse of Children poppers
All I ever knew of England was the poverty and the brutality of the workhouse.
I grew up with the lesson of my youth burned into my soul
I ask nothing of other men than that I gave them.
A year ago, in darkest Africa, I met a man who restored my faith
In the England I had learned to hate as a child.
And you gentlemen are destroying the faith he built in me.
As you seem bent on destroying every other great accomplishment
Of the greatest man I have ever known.
Dr.Livingstone is out there.
He is old and he is sick. and he needs your help to carry on the great work he has undertaken. the work that is indicated, however inadequately upon those maps.
Reject those maps, withhold your aid and you destroy him.
Reject those maps and you close Africa for generations to come.
Reject those maps gentlemen and you pelt faith with the greatest geographer and one of the greatest man of our times.
Gentlemen, the choice is yours.
Take your vote.
I am sure that Dr.Livingstone himself would say ... 'I live it with you'.
-Oh! That was glorious.
- Fine words Mr. Chairman
But still not one word of proof.
I move that this meeting to go on record by putting Mr. Stanley's report to a vote.
Gentlemen, all those who are in favor of accepting Mr. Stanley's report please rise.
All those who are opposed to accepting
Mr.Stanleys report, please rise.
Gentleman, the verdict is clear.
It is the sense of this meeting that Mr. Stanley's claim be rejected.
The table entertains the motion adjourned.
-Sir John    - Yes! What is it? 
- A message  
Well Stanley, guess you know now, how I feel when people wont believe what I tell them.
Stanley.. Stanley.. They are calling the meeting back to order.
- What happened?
- Something's happened. We better go back.
I have just received a communication from
London which I feel, is of utmost importance
I will read it to you without comment
It is from Lord Bill Hampton and it is addressed to me
Sir, a message has just been received from Zanzibar
The body of Doctor David Livingstone has been brought to the coast by native bearers
Doctor Livingstone died several months ago on a journey to Lualava river.
That is not all gentlemen! The letter goes on, bearers also delivered to the British consulate of Zanzibar
A last message written by Dr.Livingstone in which the Doctor mentioned Mr.Henry.Stanley.
The following message contains 
Dr.Livingstone's last request and is addressed to Mr. Stanley.
'Too weak to go on. Have asked my heart be buried here, together with my dreams'
My son, the torch has fallen from my hand.
Come and relight it.
Mr. Chairman! .... - Lord Tyce
- Mr. Chairman
I have the great honor to propose, the previous resolution be stricken from minutes of this meeting
And that we accept Mr. Stanley's report.
And with our acceptance tender him our humble apologies, for our stupidity and bad manners.
In which I Mr. Stanley, have been
The greatest offender.
From Bennett. The 3rd today. I don't seem able to convince him that I am not coming to New York.
I guess I will have to name a mountain something after him.
Well, I guess, I better get aboard.
I wont try to tell you how wonderful
It's been to be able to know you
You see I was right. I wasn't imagining things.
You are going to follow in
Doctor Livingstone's footsteps.
No man alive could hope to follow his footsteps.
I can at least try to finish the work he started.
And I wont be alone when I reach the spot.
Where the Lualava meets the sea.
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye Henry! And God bless you.
The End
Uncover. Uncover.
Uncover.
Uncover.
-Captain Swanson of His Majesty's forces.
-Lieutenant Fouchier.
Fifteen English prisoners for 15 French prisoners.
Sergeant, deliver the prisoners to Lieutenant Fouchier.
Yes, sir. This way, sir.
One of these days, l'm gonna push the open end of a musket down your throat.
Step back into line there.
My apologies, Lieutenant. lt is customary for His Majesty's soldiers, if l may call you that without maligning my sense of proportion, to observe the rules of civilized warfare.
-Yes, sir.
-Tripe.
-Who said that?
-l did.
Did you ever see a white man teach an lndian to walk up under a flag of truce and blast a soldier from a gun hidden under a blanket?
-What's your name?
-His name is James Smith.
What do you mean by talking for him?
Professor sometimes talks for me.
Corporal, hold these men for court-martial.
They'll pluck those cocky rooster feathers out of your tail
-for court-martialing civilians.
-Civilians indeed.
-Deserters, more likely.
-We're civilians!
Born in Pennsylvania, taken three years ago by Caughnawaga lndians.
We're initiated to the tribe.
You can tell your story to a court-martial. lf you're not a fool, l reckon you'll listen to it here!
We escaped while the tribe visited Quebec.
The French caught us and here we are.
Shackle these men with the rest of the deserters.
We're civilians!
You've no right to hold us here!
Colonel Clapp, Captain Swanson. l'd like to get you behind a barn, back home in Pennsylvania !
Jim !
And the Professor.
-Where have you been?
-We were taken by the Caughnawagas.
-You still got your scalps.
-They made us blood brothers.
-Are these friends of yours?
-Aye. Let me introduce you.
There's Jim Smith and the Professor.
From Pennsylvania. l thought they were dead.
They've been missing these three years.
The best lndian fighters in the colonies.
All right, Corporal, you may release them.
You'd better read your dispatch, Captain.
Gentlemen, Quebec is English.
Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!
Quebec is British.
That closes the frontier.
There's no more stirring up the lndians against us.
No more massacres.
Thank God.
General Wolfe said he'd do it and he's done it.
General Wolfe is dead, sir.
He died with his face to the enemy. l guess we can go home now, Mac.
Maybe our stomachs found a friend.
All right, come on, boys.
You've had your hot meal.
Now back to work.
Break stone, Teagle, help Spode with that axle.
-MacDougall.
-Hiya, laddie. l heard you was up in Canada with
General Wolfe, fighting the French. l was just showing the General how to fight lndians. l killed 30 Onondagas in one day. Aye.
-No.
-Aye.
How dead lndians do multiply!
Well, maybe it was 20 Onondagas, but that's not to be saying that a MacDougall like myself couldn't have killed 30 if he had a mind to.
They're bosom cronies of mine.
-This is Jim Smith and the Professor.
-How are you?
-Strangers around here, ain't you?
-We've been away a little while.
This is Gary Smith's laddie.
-Oh, yeah.
-Could you spare a mite of that grub?
Oh, fall to, lads. We've had ours, but there's plenty hanging. l suppose you wouldn't be having a snifter of whiskey, just a wee drop?
You know, my appetite's not so good without a bit of a tonic just to wet my whistle.
No, Mac, we don't traffic in firewater.
We only carry trade goods for the lndians.
-Trade goods?
-l thought the border was closed.
Don't have to be, now that the French have surrendered Quebec.
Colonel Brady's out in Ohio making treaties with the lnjuns now.
They're real friendly-like, the lnjuns.
The only friendly lndians are dead lndians, l say. lf we don't trade with them, the French will.
You know how they stir them up against us, with firewater. lt's a patriotic duty we're doing.
Did you ask Tom Lowther about this patriotism?
The lndians beat in his boy's head with a musket and left it sticking in his skull.
Rum !
So you don't carry any spirits.
Stop! Where are my spoons?
Stop, thief! Stop!
Five pewter spoons missing and a tankard.
Blast them for the thieves that they are and blast me for the trusting woman l am !
Now, Janie, that'll do, l'll have no swearing from a daughter of mine.
So, you're back.
Now, now, lassie, it was no fault of mine. l was coming home, sober as a judge, when, bang, without even a word of apology, a patrol got hold of me and pressed me into the army.
Against my will.
Even when l told them what a beautiful and dutiful daughter l had.
Who'd tend the tavern while you're away, swilling army rum?
What, me?
Why, l've got the best here in the cellar at home.
That you can't get at.
Oh, Mac, don't go away and leave me again.
Take me with you like you used to.
Oh, you contrary female MacDougall!
No.
Hello, Janie.
Put me down, Mac.
And the Professor, they're back from the very mouth of the grave.
They'd all say,
''He's dead, you'd better forget him.''
And l'd say ''Sure, he's dead, he's forgotten,'' but l knew it wasn't so. l didn't let myself know anything else, l knew you'd come back.
And just where were you, and what were you doing?
-Well, a...
-Oh, no, no, l don't care.
You're here now.
Blast it, Mac, do you have to stand around and watch a girl make a fool of herself?
Get in and get your rum.
And you, too, Professor. lt is a wee bit chilly.
You've grown up, Janie. lsn't that much nicer, for both of us?
Still the same shameless wench.
Am l supposed to be ashamed? l will be if you want me to, but l don't feel ashamed,
-not before the man l'm going to marry.
-Marry?
Yes, you gave me your word, you promised, don't you remember?
There's another girl!
Somewhere you've hitched yourself to another girl!
Blast you for a bigamist scoundrel!
-Your temper is no better.
-l'll have the law on you! l'll have you put in stocks for breaking your promise!
-l promised a half-grown girl.
-Half-grown? Half-grown?
Stop whimpering about marriage.
We're very hungry and tired men.
Come inside, Jim.
Half-grown, am l?
Well, l'm full-grown, now. l killed 40 Onondagas in one day.
The barrel of my gun, it got so hot, l used it to warm up the rum toddies. lt got so hot, l...
The war is over, Mac. Come on, get behind the bar and work for your keep.
Woe is me. l'm a victim of the skirling blood of the MacDougalls.
Janie, are you happy?
Oh, mind your pig.
What am l to do?
The whole town knows we were going to be married.
Now you've changed your mind.
Why don't you put a rein to your nimble imagination, girl?
Let him do his own talking.
The Professor always talks for me.
You only thought he promised.
They'll point me out as a girl who was left.
Well, then, marry and fool them.
Who'll have me after you've tossed me aside?
Well, l don't know.
You're not bad to look at. l think so, too.
But maybe it's because we've lived with lndians so long.
You're an lndian, cruel and merciless!
Janie, l'm no man for you.
-He's going over the far hills too much.
-l wouldn't care! l wouldn't ask for anything except to go with you.
You can't die once, and then come alive and go away again. lt's like making me see you die twice, l couldn't stand it.
Jed, Tom... lndians. lndians. They're all around Fort Pitt.
Shawnee and Delaware.
They've burned the town and they've scalped the kids in school at McDowell's Mill.
Let's be on the way, boys.
McDowell's Mill is 20 miles from here.
-Any more guns in the house?
-Two long rifles.
Well, l know where we can get some more.
You're not going again, Jim, you're not!
Mac, Mac, tell him not to go!
Don't be a fool, lassie, you know what we have to do.
All dead, Jim. Horrible.
Dirty, murdering heathens. l'm taking my family and leaving while we're still alive.
Aye. l'm fair sick of it.
A remarkably fine season and what good is it?
You can't harvest for fear of bloodthirsty barbarians.
Men, if the Conococheague settlements stand firm the country will have some little sort of safety.
Safe for the blasted tradesmen.
For the fields of corn you planted.
For the plenty we've taken and will take from this land. l will water it with my blood before l give it up.
-And l.
-And l.
Everybody accounted for?
All except Jacob Miller's two kids.
They must have taken them alive.
Mrs. Lewis, do you know if Jacob Miller's kids got taken?
Mrs. Lewis? l picked up the tracks.
About 20 of them. Delawares, l think. l'm not sure, but they seem to have a couple of youngsters with them.
-Any missing?
-Yes. l want about 10 men with me.
Stewart, Calhoon, M'Cammon, Professor.
You got plenty of charcoal over there,
M'Cammon?
Yes, and plenty of bear grease.
Now, we're traveling light, so are the Delawares but they'll be held back because they're carrying the kids along.
Twenty of them. lt's just the odds l like. l'll kill them myself like l did them Onondagas in one day. l wanna see your guns.
Trade musket. They're no good.
They misfire too often.
Sorry, M'Cammon, we can't take you with us. lf it misfires, Jim, l'll use my knife. l'm only taking men with long rifles, M'Cammon.
-Mac! Mac!
-Janie, lassie. What brought you here?
With lndians loose, you might have been scalped from your eyebrows to your shoulder blades.
Here, l'll get somebody to take you back. l'm not going back. l've seen what the lndians did and l'm going with you.
-l forbid it.
-What?
Positively.
You forbid it?
How much is this valley your home?
Did you see those bullet holes in the walls of the tavern?
Who fought off the lndians? Not you.
You were always busy somewhere else fighting somebody else's fight.
And now you're forbidding me to fight my own.
-Get back to the tavern, girl.
-Let her come along.
Oh, Jim.
Jim, you're a fine and generous man.
All right, off with your shirts.
Smear your bodies.
We're lndians, you know.
Well, off with your shirt. lf you travel with us you travel like the rest of us.
How sly. How very sly.
We'll need your long rifle.
-Here's your weapon, M'Cammon.
-Thanks.
Some of you boys see that Janie gets home.
They didn't come out here.
We'll have to split up, Jim.
Delawares. They've gone upstream.
Mac, you take the right bank, l'll take the left. l want him alive.
Jim, 20 lndians a day has always been my minimum.
Don't leave me at 19. l'll never be able to hold me head up again.
Come on, we'll get the water out of him.
Oh, darn, Jim, laddie.
They trade muskets and trade tomahawks.
-Everybody all right?
-All right.
All here.
Gather up the rifles and the powder horns.
English cartouche box.
What regiment is it, Tom?
Why, that's Colonel Brady's regiment.
He's supposed to be out on the Ohio making treaties.
He said they wiped out Brady and the men.
We teach them everything, don't we, Tom?
His Excellency, Governor Penn, will see you tomorrow.
Thank you.
What is the meaning of this intrusion? l sent word l'd see you tomorrow.
What we've got to say can't wait till tomorrow.
-Why, how dare...
-Our apologies, Your Excellency,
-we're Conococheague Valley men.
-l see.
Frightful tragedy, frightful.
This is General Gage, in command of His Majesty's forces.
We've come to request Your Excellency to forbid trade with the lndians, and to ask military protection for the valley. l understand and sympathize with you, but l have judged it consistent with the good of His Majesty's service to order all available troops westward to meet the lndians on their own grounds.
While they murder us on our grounds.
We're carrying out a military policy designed to guarantee the permanent security of the frontier.
Haven't you eyes enough to see that?
We've eyes enough to see only our own dead.
Colonel Brady has received the lndian chieftains...
Colonel Brady will receive no more chieftains...
What's that? What's that?
Dead men make no peace treaties.
-What are you saying?
-Colonel Brady and his men are dead.
Dead?
Their heads split open with tomahawks made by white men.
''A proclamation. From this day all persons whosoever they may be,
''are forbidden to trade with lndians.
''Anyone failing to heed this warning, does so at his own peril.
''The Valley of the Conococheague is forthwith taxed £1 per capita
''for the erection of Fort Loudoun, and the maintenance of His Majesty's troop
''to be permanently stationed there for the protection of said valley.
''John Penn. God save the King.''
This is the reward of aiding the mother country with her trade.
Warehouses filled with goods.
Goods that cost us hard cash, fetched 3,000 miles from England.
Must we endure it?
What's the army for, if not to protect business?
And what's government for, if not to protect business?
Certainly not to interfere with it.
Gentlemen, you still do business with the army, don't you? lt will take 20 years for the army to buy up the supplies we have on hand, and furthermore, there's no profit in it. l wasn't thinking of that.
You'll have a military permit to take goods through to the outlying forts, won't you?
Yes.
Now, if a shipping clerk made a mistake, and sent a few wagonloads of trade goods through with the military supplies, they'd be traveling under the protection of a military pass, wouldn't they?
-Barmaid, barmaid!
-Yes, sir.
Another for each of us.
All right, boys. Get out the musket balls.
Fifty keg of musket ball for Fort Pitt.
Fifty keg of musket ball for Fort Pitt. Right.
Put the musket balls aside.
We load them on the top. l'll kill the man that drops a keg of that rum.
-This is it, sir.
-Give the order to halt, Sergeant.
-Company, halt!
-Company, halt!
A tavern?
Their magistrates and commissioners meet in a tavern?
Yes, sir.
Most every place in the outlying sections, the tavern's sort of community public house,
-government quarters, newspaper...
-Accompany me inside, Sergeant.
Yes, sir. l'm Captain Swanson.
Who's in charge here?
Magistrate Duncan and Magistrate Morris, they're in charge.
Glad to meet you, gentlemen. l'm sure we shall get on.
May l say how grateful we are to have you and your men, Captain?
Your gratitude belongs to the Crown,
Mr. Magistrate.
We're all servants of His Majesty.
Now, as to provisions,
Sergeant McGlashan will weekly requisition our needs.
You'll be given army certificates redeemable in cash.
-That ought to be satisfactory.
-We'll be happy to accommodate you, sir.
All provisions delivered to the fort are to be in prime condition.
Any attempts to supply provisions of inferior quality will be met by severe rebuke.
Severe rebuke.
Do l make myself clear, gentlemen?
You don't know us, sir, otherwise you wouldn't be saying that.
You will notify me each week when the provisions arrive.
-Yes, sir.
-l will make the inspections myself.
That's all, gentlemen.
Why, the uppish gamecock.
-l demand that man's arrest.
-On what charge?
The man was in contempt of court.
You're not sitting in a military session, exchanging prisoners now,
Captain Swanson.
For which l'm grateful. l rather resent the army gambling on exchange and losing.
This is a civil court.
And l advise you to keep that kind of a tongue in your head.
Jim, Captain Jim !
Them blackguards has took up the trade again.
They come through Shippensburg this morning, three wagons.
-You mean with trade goods?
-Yes.
They wouldn't dare, they wouldn't dare.
With the King's proclamation on the door of every inn and every magistrate's house.
-lt must be army goods.
-lt ain't. l seen them. lt's paint, knives and hatchets and powder.
You'll turn them back, of course.
Are you sure of your information?
Sure of it? l tried to reason with them.
They said, ''Get the devil out of the valley if you're scared of lndians.''
-Why weren't they stopped at Carlisle?
-Stop them?
They've got a military permit signed by the Commanding Officer in Philadelphia.
You must be mistaken. lf the goods are under permit, they're military supplies. l ain't mistaken.
Are you implying that my commanding officer is corrupt?
You'd best mind your tongue.
He's implying nothing, but for us to let those goods go through would be committing suicide. l'll arrest any man that interferes with a military permit.
Then you're going to let the goods go through?
My orders were to protect the frontier, and to teach a wholesome respect for the
Sovereign law and His Majesty's forces.
Those orders will be carried out, even if l have to declare martial law.
And to think we asked for them.
The swine, the crooked swine.
We'll stop them ourselves. lf it's force you're thinking of using, you'd best forget it.
-You'll end in hanging.
-Then we'll hang.
At least we'll die with our scalps intact.
Calhoon, l think you could do with a drink,
-as can Mac...
-Aye.
...and the Professor.
M'Cammon and a few of you other boys, come to my room.
Janie, bring some hot toddies.
Looks like it's going to be a cold night out.
We've work to do.
-Ready?
-Aye.
Aye.
Blankets off.
Each man 10 feet apart.
Shoot over their heads.
Get rid of that blanket.
What's the matter with you?
-Are you drunk?
-You're choking me.
Janie, what kind of a joke is this? lt's not a joke, Jim. lf you're going to hang, l'll hang with you.
That's the least you can let me do.
Ah, the female MacDougalls were all famed for their tenderness.
The lass is fair daft about you, Jimmy.
All right, men.
Hold it!
Steady down these horses!
Listen to me!
Take these loads out in the clearing and pile them all in one place.
And be fast about it.
Take whatever government property you may be carrying and clear out. Get out!
All right, boys.
Pile the rest of this stuff up, boys.
We're going to light a little fire of our own.
Get all the stuff out of all those wagons. l don't think the government is going to like very much this destruction of their property.
Come in.
-Sorry to disturb you, sir, but...
-l'm Callendar. l pack train for Poole and Simmons,
Philadelphia.
-Charmed.
-We contract army supplies.
Go on, get on with it, get on with it.
A pack of blasted settlers, dressed like lndians, attacked my train and burned the army goods.
Army goods?
There's a cartouche box.
That's all that's left.
The shot's melted down, the powder is...
-McGlashan, call out the squad.
-Yes, sir.
-Nearly murdered me and my men.
-Rabble, cutthroats, criminals!
Destroy His Majesty's goods, will they? l'll teach them the meaning of the King's name, if l have to write it across their backs with a lash!
Look alive, men.
-Quick, get him.
-Aye, he's one of them. l'll brook no escape.
You can still see the black paint behind his ears.
That's dirt. l never wash behind the ears.
Let go! lt's a girl!
Hold her.
The man that loosens her receives 30 days' bread and water.
Who were the others with you?
What were their names?
Just like that.
You'll wear the seat out of those silk britches before l talk.
Janie!
What did you take her for?
-For destroying King's property.
-She's destroyed no King's property.
McGlashan, clear this rabble.
You'll not take the lass to Fort Loudoun without a warrant.
By the living Jehoshaphat, l'll blow out your heart.
You'll do what, you treasonable dog?
Disarm them.
Now, shall we get on to the fort, McGlashan?
Yes, sir.
Company, halt!
What do you mean by halting the King's men with an armed mob?
We want those prisoners, Captain.
You took them without warrant.
-There's still English law in the valley.
-They're British and freeborn. lf they're to stand trial, it will be before 12 of their peers, not before the likes of you. l've an idea they'd be court-martialed for treason, is that true?
And suppose it is?
Suppose l send them to Carlisle for court-martial, what will you do about it?
We'll do this.
We'll be forced to fire on you.
No, Jim, Mac, we'll go with them.
Move the prisoners to the rear and fix bayonets.
No.
Perhaps you'll understand we mean to have those prisoners. l'll release them only to your magistrate under the condition they stand trial for treason. l'll see that they stand trial.
Release the prisoners.
Release the prisoners.
Will you promise to stop the traders?
You have this promise, that any man who interferes with a military permit will make the acquaintance of the hangman.
Shoulder your firelocks, quick step, march.
We'll sew up this valley so tight, a cricket can't get in or out without our say-so.
No. Turn back.
The valley is closed. Turn back.
-Stop. The valley is closed.
-Stop. Turn back.
-The valley is closed.
-Stop. Turn back.
The valley is closed. Turn back.
Turn back. The valley is closed. Turn back.
''Men of the Conococheague,
''you are to come to MacDougall's Tavern
''and fill yourselves with liquor and swearing.
''There is a large bounty for everyone, military goods.
''We'll have Captain Swanson whipped or hanged.''
Don't you think this is a little obvious?
You gotta make it plain.
Them people are thick-headed.
''We may do as we please for we have the law and government in our hands.
''Any bounty captured must be spent in our town,
''the only town tolerating drinking, swearing, Sabbath-breaking,
''and any outrage we have a mind to do.
''Signed, James Smith and his
Black Boys of the Conococheague.''
Well, it should convince the Governor he's dealing with rioters and rebels.
They've blockaded the valley.
No word can get through except what they choose.
They wouldn't dare treat
His Majesty's troops with such indignity.
They've no respect for law.
Their magistrates are with them, leading them.
Have Magistrate Duncan come in. l've called their magistrate to Philadelphia.
Magistrate Duncan.
This gentleman informs me that you've encouraged and protected rioters in the Conococheague Valley in their illegal and disorderly proceedings.
There have been no illegal nor disorderly proceedings.
Burned my goods. They burned my goods.
The pack train was illegal,
Your Excellency, contrary to your proclamation.
There's what's left of the military supplies.
Does that look like trade goods?
This gentleman has been misinformed.
They were not government goods.
Were government troops fired upon?
Not one shot has been fired against the royal garrison, Your Excellency. l swear those goods were lndian trade goods.
More than that l cannot say.
More than that l will say.
My pack leader managed to evade the blockade.
Callendar.
Where's that advertisement?
These were found nailed to the trees all through the Conococheague Valley.
The one you have in your hand was taken from the wall of MacDougall's Tavern.
Sound reason for everything they've done, indeed.
Bloody-minded cutthroats!
May l see it, sir?
There's something queer about this advertisement, mighty queer.
No Conococheague man ever did this. l find it disagreeably necessary to apply to General Gage for the assistance of His Majesty's troops.
Reinforcements will be ready to march in a week. l demand military escort for my supply train.
You shall have it.
You will issue a warrant for the apprehension of James Smith.
You will lend your assistance in discovering and apprehending all persons who may be concerned. l issue no warrants against Jim Smith or any of the valley men.
-Jim? Where's Jim?
-There he is.
Jim, they're issuing a warrant for your arrest. You've got to leave.
Governor Penn himself is issuing it.
And General Gage is sending reinforcements in a few days to put down the insurrection.
-You must go, Jim.
-No.
Those traders will do anything to hang you.
And Gage has promised them military escort for their pack trains.
Callendar will probably rush through a train before the reinforcements arrive.
He'll be afraid to wait with too many soldiers about.
He will that, if he's carrying lndian trade goods.
-Well, we'll let the train through.
-Let it through?
Jim, are you crazy?
What is it, Jim?
What are you thinking about?
We'll use him as bait for a trap. lf Fort Loudoun becomes a warehouse for illegal goods, its commandant is done for. lt'll be proof that he's unlawfully conniving with traders.
We'll prove we're not rebels.
We have him now. He's taken the bait.
Tell the valley men to come to MacDougall's.
Jim Smith wants you to come to MacDougall's!
Jim Smith says, ''Come to MacDougall's! ''
Jim Smith says, ''Come to MacDougall's! ''
Jim Smith says, ''Come to MacDougall's.''
-Come to MacDougall's.
-Come to MacDougall's.
-Come to MacDougall's.
-MacDougall's.
Come to MacDougall's.
James, there's your search warrant, and it's all in order.
You'd better come along to serve it.
Just a minute, men.
M'Cammon, Calhoon, Stewart,
Lewis and Janie here are out on bail.
We promised the Captain they'd be tried for treason.
Now it isn't beholden for men out on bail to be appearing before a fort making demands. lf you think it'll be hurting you, then l'll stay.
That won't be necessary, Tom.
We'll try you immediately.
Jim, you can appear for the defense. l'll choose a jury, and if it isn't to your liking you can object.
The prisoners over there before the bar and the jurymen down here on this side of the table, as l call off your names.
Burke, Callahan, Brown, Reynolds,
Allison, Bouquet, Forbes, Spears,
Josephs, Owens, Grant, Pierry.
-Jim, have you any objections?
-No objections.
Gentlemen, what is your verdict on Tom Calhoon?
Not guilty.
-John M'Cammon?
-Not guilty.
-Stewart?
-Not guilty.
-Lewis?
-Not guilty.
-Janie McDougall?
-Guilty.
-What?
-Guilty as charged.
MacDougall, the court charges you to lock your daughter in the wine cellar until the court has time to pass sentence.
-You...
-Come along, lassie.
The moment you began whispering, l knew it was some filthy lndian trick! l think you'd best forget him.
He's bad medicine for lasses.
Mac, what, what's the matter with me?
Why does he treat me like this?
Janie-wanie, you called him right, lndian.
To him a squaw belongs at home. l hate him.
Aye, and if you're like your mother, you'll break your heart with your hate.
Go on with ye, you MacDougall, you.
Something must be amiss. They let me by.
They've no stomach for firing on troops.
They had the look of cats that had just swallowed a flock of birds.
They're all about the fort, sir, close to 300 of them, armed.
-Shut and bolt the gates.
-l've already done that, sir.
Order full garrison on the wall.
What do you mean by coming here with that rabble? ln the name of public safety, we want permission to inspect the trader's goods stored in your fort.
You've a rare appreciation of public order with an armed mob at your back. l have a search warrant to inspect the goods.
The goods are under my protection. l've orders from General Gage.
Here, do you see this?
That's General Gage's own order.
What more do you want?
Here, do you see this? lt's the King's proclamation.
We want to see the goods.
Nothing short of that will satisfy the people around here.
You'll inspect no goods in my care. l've my orders. lt might be as well to remember, this road is not a military road.
And while we're talking, you might get it through your head.
We built your fort.
We'll not have it used against us.
Now, will you let us in? l will not.
You're using our fort as a storehouse for illegal goods.
According to the King's proclamation, you're a criminal.
And we'll deal with you as a criminal.
Back, boys.
Be back, boys.
We'll kill every mother's son of them, the dirty rattlesnakes!
Come on, let's get him out of the road.
McGlashan, those men were under a flag of truce.
-Arrest the man who fired that shot.
-Yes, sir.
Don't jiggle him so much, lads. l'll put a torch to that fort myself, if l die doing it.
That was no army musket, Tom. lt was a long rifle.
That's right, it couldn't have been a soldier. lt was one of Callendar's men. l never even shot an lndian in the back.
Jim, we'd better ride you back to the doctor.
No, we gotta take that fort before reinforcements get here.
We must have the proof.
Then let's charge them.
That's what they expect.
Their muskets won't carry this far, our long rifles will.
So we'll fire on the fort, and keep firing. ln shifts.
One shift will rest while the other keeps firing.
They won't dare go to sleep waiting for us to charge.
But we won't.
We'll just keep firing.
Jim, could we no kill two or three of them maybe?
There'll be no killings, Mac.
Don't you think you'd better get back to the surgeon, Jim?
Give the order to fire.
-Full garrison on the wall, sir.
-Keep your men ready, Sergeant.
Tell them to hold their fire and watch for the assault.
Yes, sir.
Hold your fire, and watch for the assault!
Sergeant McGlashan.
Yes, sir.
Tell the men to get to the bottom of the barricade where the logs are the thickest.
Yes, sir.
And tell them that the first man that falls asleep
-gets 20 lashes to keep him awake.
-Yes, sir.
Stay awake, men. Stay awake.
They'll attack the moment you fall asleep.
Stay awake. Come along there. Wake up.
Wake up there. Wake up.
Sorry, sir.
-That's all right, lad, just stay awake.
-Yes, sir.
Two hour shifts today.
-How's Jim?
-He's all right. Let's keep going.
Come on. Two hour shifts today.
We need more powder and ball. l've got 50 kegs at the tavern.
-Take 20 horses, men, and go get them.
-Aye.
Good morning, lass.
Did you have a good night last night?
You men do it well, tormenting a girl.
-You must be born with the gift.
-Now, now, lassie.
Jim Smith and the magistrate's put you here for your own safety.
The powder is through there, lads.
-Mac, is a fight on?
-Aye, a grand fight. l killed 20 of 'em me self.
A great pity you can't scalp them. lt's no civilized to scalp white men.
Put some vigor in it, lads.
Jim Smith's waiting.
Jim Smith.
Put those kegs down.
Are ye crazy?
We're running short of ammunition.
Tell Jim Smith to get it somewhere else.
This is my powder and it stays here.
Now, put them down.
Just as things were going our way.
You'll be run out of the valley.
Well, maybe l will, but l'll be here long enough to see that, that white lndian hanging from a gallows.
Now, now, lassie, that's no way to be talking of a man who's half dead from a soldier's bullet.
-Oh, no, Mac, no.
-Aye, Janie, aye. lt'll be a miracle if he lasts out the day. lf you've let him be killed, l'll shoot the lot of you, every last man of you.
Heave ho, me lads, heave ho.
Jim !
-Where's Jim?
-Right there, by the fire.
Jim !
Darling, darling, darling.
How did you get out?
Do you think anything would keep me?
Do you think l'd let you die alone?
Die? Who said l was going to die?
Mac said so.
Oh, it's only in the shoulder, but if you're really set, l might die...
You wouldn't be doing that if l wasn't just a little bit helpless.
Now, what kind of a fool would l be, if l didn't take advantage of my opportunities?
Let's look at that.
Go away. lf he's a bit warm, it's that kissing business, not the bullet.
A white flag! Hold your fire. A white flag!
Jim, Jim. The white flag.
First we want the trade goods.
Second, he and his men are to get out of the valley.
We asked for them here, now we don't want them. They're to git.
Yes, sir.
And they may keep their weapons.
They agreed, Jim.
Heads up, lads. Heads up.
Show this rabble our heads are up.
Open the gates.
-Give the order to march, Sergeant.
-Yes, sir.
Squads right, march!
Forward, march!
Captain Swanson.
Company, halt.
Jim Smith would like words with you.
The goods are in the fort.
There's one thing we want you to understand.
We're law-abiding men.
There is one thing l do understand.
You're a lot of blasted traitors.
We whipped him !
We whipped the saucy peacock. l claim his scalp. ln the name of the law, l'll lift his scalp from his eyebrows to his shoulder blades!
Mac!
Let me at him.
He's worse than the black lndian devil. ln the name of the law.
Law-abiding men, loyal subjects.
Drunken rabble you are, but l'll be back! l'll be back and you'll pay for this!
Forward march.
-Forward...
-Forward.
...march!
Stop where you are, Callendar.
We're free to go with Swanson.
You'll go with Swanson later.
Get back to the fort.
Listen, men, wait a minute. l'm just a driver. l didn't have anything to do with the goods.
Thank you.
Jim better this morning?
He thinks he is, but he's not. l say we stay and fight.
We've whipped them once, and we'll whip them again.
Fight 200 regulars?
They'll probably come with cannon.
Magistrate Morris, load a wagon full of the trade goods.
Take it to General Gage in Philadelphia.
M'Cammon knows the south hills.
You'll avoid the troops that way.
But that might take several weeks.
The rest of us can hide in Martin's Rock.
They're 10 miles away, Jim.
That cock-sparrow Swanson is with them.
We'd better get started.
Then we'll have to tie you on your horse, Jim.
He can't hide in a cave. He'll die. l won't let him go.
He's going to see Dr. Stoke.
Back to the tavern, girl.
Back to the tavern.
Let men go about the work they've got to do.
Easy, lad, let us do most of the work.
When you get to Philadelphia, speak to no one but General Gage or Governor Penn.
And God go with you.
Come on, men, put some backbone into it.
Give me your foot. Put your arm around my shoulders. Careful!
-Put him in the cart, men.
-Janie.
-Put that gun down.
-l won't. l'm not going to be a widow before l'm even a wife. l forbid you to use such talk before all these men. lt's no becoming to a female McDougall.
Do you think l care what's becoming and what's not?
He'll die and just because he wants to be a big, brave, loyal chief.
He won't leave his men.
Well, his men can go hang for all of me.
He's going to see Dr. Stoke, if l have to kill you and him to do it!
Well, there's something in what the lass says.
She's a hysterical, arrogant shrew, and shouldn't be trusted with a lethal weapon.
Take it away from her.
Now, now, lassie, calm yourself, calm yourself.
You wouldn't shoot your loving father, would you?
The last male member of the fine line of the MacDougalls.
One more step, Mac, and the fine line is finished.
Wait, Janie,
Dr. Stoke is 15 miles from here. l can take him through.
What else do you think l want with him but to see him alive and safe?
Why do you treat me like a witless child?
Put him in the wagon.
-Put me astride.
-No, Jim, the lass is right.
She'll get you through.
You're being twisted about by a comely face.
She loves you, Jim.
Are we to be the victims of a girl's springtime fancy?
-l'm going with you.
-And me.
You'd do best, Mac, to stay far away from Jim for a while. l'm sorry, Janie, terribly sorry.
Rum and lndian fighting makes a poor mixture for the father of a young lassie. lf l had it to do all over, Mac, l'd pick you again.
''Whereas l have received information that sundry persons have,
''at several times, assembled themselves in armed bodies,
''and have in a most riotous and illegal manner
''presumed to interrupt the passage of supplies to the fort,
''l do hereby require all His Majesty's subjects
''to give such evidence as to apprehend all persons
''concerned in the leading of these riots
''so that the offenders may be prosecuted according to law.
''Signed, John Penn.''
God save the King.
Disperse them and get on with it.
Next prisoner.
Driving his cattle into the swamp and refused to billet. lsn't he one of the scum that whipped me? lt looks like him.
Put him in irons.
Turn them over.
-Another one.
-All right, stand in line. Stand up.
Put his leg irons on first.
Heave ho, here we go.
All right, get the other one.
Stay on your feet!
All right, stand over there.
Come over there.
Prepared to talk, gentlemen? l want James Smith.
The man that tells me where he is, wins full pardon. lf you'd serve your King with one-tenth the loyalty you serve that treasonable dog Smith, you wouldn't be in jail this moment!
Jim, Jim Smith! Jim !
He's not here. l know he's here, Janie. l've got to see him.
-He's not here. ls he, Doctor?
-No, he's not here.
-Jim, Jim Smith, it's Anderson.
-Shut up, you blasted...
-Will Anderson! Will Anderson!
-He's not here, l tell you.
-Shut up!
-You looking for me, Will?
Jim, they've got half the valley in irons.
No warrants, no trials.
Just a trader's word and you're in chains.
They're even paying off men that ain't had nothing to do with it.
You just don't have to like them to find yourself accused and convicted of riot, arson and armed robbery. l'll be right down.
Dr. Stoke said you're not well enough to go. lt's finally come. l knew it would, and now's as good a time as any. lt's been so pleasant here, Jim. l sometimes even thought that...
They think more of money than they do of men. l said, l sometimes thought that you thought...
No more trading with lndians.
Jim, Jim, please don't go.
Don't let me have to stay behind and die inside of me.
Troops sit in forts and the settlers die.
Let us get up to save ourselves, and they move fast enough.
All right, go ahead.
Go ahead, l don't care!
Get shot or hung from a scaffold!
We've obeyed the law, they've broken it.
You've always torn and twisted the heart out of me. l've loved you from the first minute l can remember, and you've brought me nothing but misery.
Well, l didn't expect much more, so l asked for nothing, and l'm not asking for much now.
You fool. You cruel, merciless fool.
Come, magistrate, join the fun.
What are you men going to do?
We are going to stand the red coats on their thick heads.
Your stomach's got to be right to take a whore.
They've gone to report to the fort.
We'll give them a half-hour start.
They are all drunk at McDougall's, bragging that they are going to take the fort.
McGlashan, take a squad and bring those men here.
Yes, sir.
Nine men are going to take the fort.
And nine drunks are going to take the fort.
The garrison's all asleep. The gate's open.
There are only three sentries on the wall, this side.
The guard's away across the parade ground, by the kitchen.
They're getting the morning rum ration. lt's grand rum. l could almost taste the smell of it.
The guns are stacked together, full 40 paces nearer to the gate than what they are.
All right, when we run, run crouched in the mist.
Put down those muskets.
Come on down and join the party.
Calhoon, stand at the barracks door and keep them inside.
Shoot the first one that shows his head.
Find your commandant.
Tell him if there's one move, l'll blow daylight through these men.
Yes, sir.
Mac, open the guardhouse.
Get those prisoners out here.
Will, get the flints out of those muskets.
Now, Corporal, find your blacksmith and fetch him here.
Yes, sir.
All right, lads, all right.
That's the last one, Mac.
Let me do for him, Jim !
Let me do for him once and for all!
Why not add murder to your traitorous acts?
You'll never learn, will you?
You'll never learn to know us.
Take him to his quarters.
We'll give him back his fort.
That's a mistake, Jim. l said we'll give it back.
All right, men, you can return to your homes.
And leave those muskets here.
Nine men.
Only nine men.
Nine men.
Nine men!
You'd best give up. We've got you now.
One move and you're dead men.
The boldness of the swine.
He's dead.
Now we have got you, Smith.
You've murdered him.
We'll see you hanged for that.
You killed him. My shot went wild.
You fired and he fell. That's murder.
So that's it.
Tie him to a horse.
We'll take him to jail in Carlisle.
Get the stiff one.
We'll bring him along, too.
What shall l do? They'll tear the jail down.
Well, can't you reason with them?
You're the jailer.
But it's a mob. Can't you do something?
Well, l can talk to them, but they aren't going to like these.
Briggs, Briggs, come here.
Bring your chisel. Take these irons off. l've got a wife and children.
Please, tell them l'm on your side.
Here, Briggs, here, here. Right over here.
Hi, Jim, hi.
Just hang on. We'll get you out.
Mac, much obliged to you and the boys, but it'd look bad if l ran away. lt'd look like l was guilty.
Best way you can help me is to break up.
They're planning to take you back to the fort and court-martial you.
They want you out of the way.
We've done everything according to law up to now.
Make way.
Law? What law?
This kind of law, the law of bayonets? l say burn the jail down.
Burn it down around their ears!
Aye!
Men! Men! l'll talk for Jim Smith. l know what he thinks.
He doesn't want anybody to get fired on by the soldiers.
But if any of us were in there, he'd go in and get us, soldiers or no soldiers!
Janie, hold your tongue.
Tell them, Professor, tell them for me.
Men, we've fought and won, but in winning we've lost something. ln defending one law, we've come to despise all law!
And if you go on like this, we'll destroy the very thing we fight for!
Men, disband.
Go home and let me stand my trial.
-Bring in the accused.
-Yes, sir.
Bring in the prisoner.
You may remove that barbarian from the courtroom.
-He's a witness.
-Remove him.
Step out, you.
Now, laddie, l was only clearing my throat. lt's the right of every free-born Scotsman to clear his throat if he's a mind to. l clear mine a wee bit noisily perhaps.
Now, do not push. Do not push, laddie.
Any lout who feels the need of airing his spleen at the expense of the Court's decorum will find himself dining on bread and water.
Proceed.
-You're sure he's the same man?
-He made no pretense about it.
His attitude throughout was a contempt for authority. He was openly seditious. l object. The defendant is on trial for murder, not for treason. lt is our intention to establish a connection between the two.
He fired on His Majesty's troops, destroyed army supplies, interfered with the King's messengers, released prisoners held by us for court-martial.
The pack-train leader.
Ralph Callendar!
Raise your right hand.
Do you swear or affirm that the evidence you shall give in the case now in hearing shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? l do.
Did you hear Tom Calhoon offer to turn
King's evidence against James Smith? l did, sir.
When Tom Calhoon said he was going to Philadelphia to swear to the Governor about Jim Smith's treason,
Jim Smith shot him dead. l tried to stop him but Jim fired that shot so sudden and unexpected.
And he was Tom Calhoon's best friend.
Your witness.
Can you identify this, Mr. Callendar?
That there is the shirt that Tom Calhoon was wearing when Jim Smith killed him.
There's the bullet hole.
Can you identify this?
That looks like the gun he shot him with.
Now, how far would you say
Jim Smith was standing from Tom Calhoon, when you say he shot him?
About four feet.
He just put the gun up against him and shot him.
About that?
You're certain of all else you saw, why aren't you certain of this?
That's how far it was, l'm certain.
May l have the Court's permission to make an experiment?
An experiment? l should have thought the facts were sufficiently plain to speak for themselves.
Well, why try my client at all? Why not just hang him and be done with it?
Oh, all right, proceed with the experiment.
All right, Janie. ls that young person loading that weapon?
That young person is a dead shot.
There's no cause for alarm. l shall be personally responsible for any acts committed here.
Get on with it.
This is decidedly irregular and smelly.
How many more of these detonations are we to endure?
Just one.
You will note the shot fired at 20 paces carries a clean hole.
That fired at six inches is deeply studded with powder burns.
You will also notice, gentlemen, that the shirt Tom Calhoon wore carries a clean hole with no evidences of a burn.
Gentlemen, that shot was fired by some other in the crowd, someone else standing many paces away.
Order, order.
Will you permit a scoundrel to go free?
A scoundrel who leads treason and sedition and defies England? ls there to be a stench in this courtroom that will linger for centuries? l protest.
-The man is innocent of the crime.
-You are under arrest, for revealing your decision before a majority vote.
Captain Swanson.
Captain Holmes, place Mr. Poole, Ralph Callendar and the drivers under arrest for breaking the King's proclamation and transporting illegal trade-goods.
Captain Swanson, you'll retire to your quarters.
-l'll talk to you there.
-Yes, sir. l am a soldier, sir.
They could have been carrying the murderer of my own father, if they'd had a permit for it. l would have defended him with my life.
There is such a thing as understanding, Captain.
-Yes but...
-l know, l know.
We haven't taught soldiers to soften themselves at understanding.
We'll probably suffer for it.
Well, l've ordered the release of Jim Smith.
And l'm sorry, Captain Swanson, but l must relieve you of your command.
You'll report to Philadelphia and prepare to leave for England.
Yes, sir.
-Goodbye, Jim.
-Bye, Jim.
-Bye, Jim.
-Bye.
Sure you don't want to go, Mac?
Those Tennessee hills are big, wild and away from the crowd.
There'll be you and me and Professor and our surveyor friend.
Mac, are you thinking of leaving me?
This is your home, Jim.
You'll be back, l know.
Make it soon lad. We'll miss you.
Thank you, sir.
Well, Janie, even the worst of enemies must part.
Don't forget us, Jim.
Don't ever forget us.
Not for one small minute.
-Now, lass.
-l'll do my own talking.
There's so much for a man to do that there's no time for, well, other things.
But if there was time, l mean, if l was inclined, l mean... lt wouldn't be any other woman.
Only you.
-Bye, boys.
-Bye, lad.
Janie, where are you going?
With my man.
You've the skirling blood of the... lf she ain't a contrary female MacDougall!
[ Bells pealing ]
- So that's the king's bed!
- Yes.
And he's not long left it.
Feel!
- [ Women Giggling ]
- Ooh!
- l wonder what he looks like in bed.
- You'll never know.
Well, you needn't be spiteful about it.
Need she, Mistress Nurse?
No, my dear. And you've as good
a chance as anyone else... if the king's in one of his merry moods.
Oh, l never meant -- l never thought --
- Didn't you, darling?
- [ Laughing ]
Now, ladies, you're not here to quarrel but to get busy with your needles.
Now all these A's have got to come out and J's go in.
On.
That's it.
- There you are. Hurry, hurry, ladies.
- [ Chattering ]
Anne Boleyn dies this morning.
Jane Seymour takes her place tonight.
What luck.
For which of them? l wonder.
[ Crowd Chattering ]
[ Chattering Continues ]
- Here l am, darlings!
- Come along. Sit down.
Oh, thank you!
Oh, poor Anne Boleyn.
- l do feel so sorry for her.
- [ Hammering ]
Excuse me, madam.
Do you mind taking off your hat?
We can't see the block.
Thank you so much.
[ Hammering Continues ]
[ Whistling ]
[ Whistling Continues ]
[ Chattering ]
[ Laughing ]
Anne Boleyn.
Was she guilty, do you think?
- All her lovers confessed.
- Under torture.
She was as innocent as you or l.
Thanks for the compliment.
She dies so that the king may be free to marry Jane Seymour.
Yes. That's what they mean when they say, ''Chop and change.''
Oh, don't, girls. lt's no jesting matter.
[ Crowd Chattering ]
The other mirror, please,
Lady Marbury.
Will the net hold my hair together when -- when my head falls?
[ Lady Marbury Sobbing ]
Yes, madam. lsn't it a pity to lose a head like this?
Still, they will easily find a nickname for me.
Among the queens of England l shall be ''Anne sans tete. ''
That means
''Anne who lost her head.''
Ah.
There is a blade for you.
Fit for a king.
Or in this case, a queen.
N'est-ce pas?
- Not fit for our queen.
- No? Why not?
She's an English queen, ain't she?
Well, what's wrong with English steel?
And come to that, what's wrong with an English headsman?
Ah. Meaning yourself?
Why not? l was good enough to knock off the queen's five lovers, wasn't l?
Why'd they want you?
A Frenchman from Calais!
[ Spits ]
- l will tell you!
- No! l'm telling you. lt's a crying shame... with half the English executioners out of work as it is.
And why are they out of work?
Because they are only fit to sever the bull necks of their countrymen... with a butcher's cleaver.
But a woman's neck, a queen's neck --
That calls for finesse, for delicacy...
for chivalry. ln one word, a Frenchman. l could think of another word.
Jane Seymour, of all people.
Whatever could the king see in her?
Oh, she's very sweet.
Yes, but does the king like honey with his milk and water?
- [ Laughing ]
- Listen!
- Wasn't that the gun?
- What gun?
Will there be a gun fired?
When Anne Boleyn's head falls, a gun is to be fired from the tower... another from Westminster, and a third from Richmond... so that the king may know the moment he's free to marry Jane.
What a pretty arrangement. The joint goes out, and bang -- the sweets come in.
- Oh, Katherine!
- Oh, well, if the king were not a king, what would you call him?
- What would you call him?
- l'll tell you.
No. Tell me. lf l were not a king, what then?
All right, ladies.
Come here!
Look at me.
What would you call me? l should call you,
Your Majesty... a man.
Ha! So l am and glad of it.
[ Laughing ]
And you may be glad of it, too, one day.
Blushing?
She must be new to the court.
- What's your name, wench?
- Katherine Howard. lf it please Your Majesty. lt does, Katherine! lt does.
[ Crowd Chattering ]
- What's that noise?
- The crowd, madam.
Just like my wedding day.
[ Rhythmic Tapping ]
Cromwell, if England were as rich as portugal or as big as Spain, you might be right.
But this little island of three million souls is no match for all Europe.
- All Europe?
- Yes! lf those French and Germans stop cutting each other's throats, what's to stop them cutting ours?
A wise diplomacy, sire.
Diplomacy!
Diplomacy, me foot! l'm an Englishman. l can't say one thing and mean another.
What l can do is to build ships, ships and then more ships.
- You mean, double the fleet?
- Triple it!
Fortify Dover.
Rule the sea.
To do this will cost us money, sire.
To leave it undone will cost us England.
- [ Murmuring ]
- [ Bell Pealing ]
Thomas Culpeper!
Will you see what's become of the queen?
A gun will be fired from the tower, Your Majesty.
Yes! l did not mean --
Will you see if the Lady Jane is ready?
- And now the headdress, madam.
- Oh, yes.
Now, which one shall l wear?
The velvet coif or the pearl chaplet?
- Oh, the chaplet. Wear the chaplet.
- [ All Chattering ]
[ Knocking ]
The king wishes to know whether you are ready, madam.
Oh, but l don't know whether to wear the pearls or the --
Oh, of course. l'll ask the king.
[ Henry ] With a strong port in Dover
and a strong fleet in the channel...
we can laugh in their faces.
But it's the money! The money!
We must have the --
Henry!
Softly, sweetheart.
We have affairs of state here.
Oh, but, darling... this is really important.
Henry. Henry, which one shall l wear?
My Lord Archbishop, will you await us in the chapel?
Henry.
You haven't said a word about my wedding dress.
Don't you love it?
Twenty-one little buttons.
One for every year of my life.
[ Laughing ]
[ Jane Laughing ]
- Don't you love the back?
- The back? Marvelous!
[ Jane Laughing ]
Do be serious. Which of these? pearls for a pearl. Now run along, my sweet, and put them on.
The bishop waits.
Thomas, me hat!
[ Footsteps Approaching ] ls it... time? l was told that the executioner was very good.
He is very good.
lt does not hurt, madam.
lt's all over in a second.
And l have such a little neck.
Haven't l?
Well, Thomas.
What do you think of the new queen?
- Wonderful, Your Majesty.
- Beautiful?
- Lovely.
- Clever too?
A miracle of good sense,
Your Majesty.
Liar.
[ Laughing ]
No, Thomas.
Not clever, thanks be to heaven.
My first wife was clever.
My second was ambitious. My third --
Thomas, if you want to be happy, marry a girl like my sweet little Jane.
Marry a stupid woman.
[ Women Crying ]
[ Drumroll Continues ]
[ Drumroll Stops ]
What a lovely day.
What a lovely day.
[ Single Loud Drumbeat ]
Well, one must admit, she died like a queen.
Yes. And that frock.
Wasn't it too divine?
- Was it? l didn't notice.
- No, you wouldn't.
You wouldn't notice that l haven't had a new gown for a year.
All right. All right.
You shall have one... for your execution.
What --

Here. What's this?
No one is allowed near the king's marriage bed once it's been made ready.
But the marriage bed isn't made ready.
What do you suppose l've been doing for the past hour?
Swallowing the poker, by the look of you.
Hold your tongue!
- And get out of here, my good woman.
- Who are you calling a good woman?
Nice name to give one who's been 40 years with the king.
Nice or not, you can't stay here.
- What is it you want?
- Haven't you heard of my charms?
- Your charms!
- l don't mean charms of face and figure.
- l mean charm of magic.
- Oh! Magic!
Yes, the magic l put under the king's pillow to make certain he'll get a son.
Oh. Those things can only come about by chance. prince of Wales can't be left to chance.
How do l know that you're not up to some mischief?
Fool! l, harm the king, who nursed him from his birth?
[ Spitting ]
Now, you'll see. lt will be a boy.
[ Baby Crying ]
[ Nursemaid ]
Oh, no, baby.
[ Murmuring ]
Yes.
[ lmitating Crying ]
There, baby.
Yes.
[ Murmuring ]
My only little one.
Sweet little one!
[ Man ] Send a fast horseman for the king
and riders everywhere with the news.
[ Baby Crying ]
[ Horns. Fanfare ]
[ Men Calling ]
[ Calling Continues ]
Hello, hello, hello, hello!
Hello, hello!
Good bird!
[ Calling Resumes ]
She's got him!
She's got him for a ducat.
[ Man Calls ]
- What do you want?
- Your Majesty, it's a boy.
What? lt's a boy!
Men, it's a boy!
[ Cheering ]
[ Horns. Fanfare ]
[ Fades ]
[ Man Muttering ]
Where's the boy?
- ls he dead?
- The prince is alive, Your Majesty...
but the queen is dead. poor pretty little Jane.
God rest her sweet soul.
Where's the prince?
[ Humming ]
Shh!
My son.
[ Chuckles ]
One day you'll rule England.
[ Laughs ]
A greater England than mine.
That is, if you're strong enough to hold the scepter firmly.
See, here it is.
[ Laughing ]
Bravely done, my little prince.
That's the way of it!
[ Laughing ]
Now, through tears and cruelty and pain you came into the world... and by the same road you'll reach the throne... and by the same road hold it.
[ Chuckling ]
You smile, do you?
Well, smile while you may.
You'll find the throne of England no smiling matter.
Mmm. Now.
Look at him, the little love.
Taking it all in, as if he were a full-grown Christian.
Just the image of you when you were a baby.
- ls he?
- Yes. poor little lamb.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Get off.
Get off with you and your nonsense.
Your great big beard in the poor child's face.
Enough to frighten him out of his wits.
Be off with you. Be off with you!
[ Humming ]
[ Chattering ]
[ Excited Chattering ]
- Oh!
- Oh! Look at your baby. lsn't he a love?
- His father's image.
- His eyes too.
- And his hands.
- And his deep chest too.
- And the same legs.
- And the same --
- Eh, madam, not before the child.
- [ All Laughing ]
- You think he will marry again?
- Who?
- The king.
- Let's hope not.
Three failures should convince him he has no gift for the business.
No, it was the wives' fault.
The right woman could still make him happy.
Every woman thinks herself the right wife for every other woman's husband.
And he might choose a lady of the court.
He has chosen many for a day, or at most a week.
Lady Bassett's the miracle. She's lasted
1 0 whole days. He's still not weary.
Then he might -- might marry her then.
- What, Lady Bassett?
- Yes.
Oh, my good Kate.
[ Laughing ]
- [ Excited Chattering ]
- [ Henry Laughing ]
The pretty thing. To bring the child out hatless in the sun.
Come to me, my love.
Love you.
Hmm! Have you lost your wits to treat him so?
- l never thought, um --
- You never thought?
What are brains for, except to think?
No, no, no. You must strut about among your lights of love.
Oh, my poor baby roasting in your arms.
- Your poor babe? My son!
- Your son? My charm.
Mmm. Baby.
[ Clears Throat ] Well, well, well.
Well, well. Shall we, uh --
Do you know how beautiful you are?
Keep your flatteries for the ladies of the court. ls there one lady of the court with eyes like wet violets... with so sweet a shape, with a mouth to drive a man mad?
Tom! l think you are mad.
Well, someday you'll love me a little who loves you so much.
Someday.
Who knows what life may bring?
The crown perhaps.
- Do you mean that?
- Stranger things have happened. ln dreams. ln dreams that sometimes come true.
And if you got your crown, what would it be worth without love?
Love is not all the world, Tom. lt is, or it is nothing.
[ Coughing ]
- [ Grunts ]
- One moment, Your Grace.
You're keeping your hair very well, Your Grace. l just met His Highness the prince of Wales out with his nurse this morning.
He's gonna have a nice head of hair one day, if he lives to enjoy it.
- Why shouldn't he?
- Oh, no reason at all.
There's no reason at all.
Let's hope he may, being as he's the only one... at least for the present.
What do you mean,
''For the present''?
Well, as l was saying only yesterday at the meeting of the barbers guild... having a family is like having a shave.
Once you start, there's no leaving off in the middle.
Are you presuming to suggest l should marry again?
That's what we think, Your Grace.
Well, get out!
[ Angry Grumbling ]
Marry again.
[ Muttering ] Marry again.
- [ Woman ] Can't you find it?
- [ Chattering ]
That's a fine condiment for the soup l want.
- [ Woman Chattering ]
- l know. l know, my dear.
What about this one?
Get, get, get, get, get!
[ Laughing ]
Whoo!
Ah, dear.
The dinner best be good tonight, or some of you will suffer.
God save us all. ls the king in one of his black moods again?
Black as ink.
They've been at him to marry again.
Ah, poor soul.
Aye. Marriage is like pastry.
One must be born to it.
More like one of those French stews.
You never know what you're getting till it's too late.
Still, a man should try for another son or two, if he's a king.
- Eh, wife?
- Yes, my man.
And even if he's not a king.
[ Laughing ]
[ Chattering ]
[ Belches, Sighs ]
- [ Muttering ]
- Shh!
You call this a capon?
Look at that.
All sauce and no substance.
Like one of Cromwell's speeches.
[ Coughing ]
And just as difficult to swallow.
Too many cooks.
That's the trouble.
Above stairs as well as below!
Marry again?
Breed more sons?
Coarse brutes.
There's no delicacy nowadays.
No consideration for others.
Refinement's a thing of the past.
Manners are dead!
[ Burps ]
And you, Master Cromwell, you may tell my loyal guild of barbers... to mind their own business and leave me to mine.
Am l the king or a breeding bull?
[ Coughs ]
Are you all dumb? l've known brighter funerals.
Have we no singers in the court? lf it please Your Grace, l will sing for you.
What will you sing?
Whatever pleases Your Grace, if l know the song.
Do you know
''What Shall l Do for Love''?
Yes, indeed.
- Good music, do you think?
- Yes, and lovely words.
Hmm. Did you know that l wrote them both?
How should l not?
lt is my favorite song.
Hmm. Let's hear it, child.
[ Ballad ]
Alas
What shall l do
For love
For love, alas
For love
What shall l do
Since none so kind l do you find
To keep you near me
Unto
Alas
Very good, my child.
[ Group Murmuring ]
Thomas. Who's the girl?
Katherine Howard, Your Majesty.
Oh, l remember.
[ Exhales, Belches ]
So, Master Cromwell, you would have me make a fourth marriage. lf Your Majesty would but consider it.
Consider it? l would consider it the victory of optimism over experience!
[ Laughing ]
[ All Laughing ]
[ Loud Laughing ]
[ Laughing, Coughing ]
But we need more heirs. l've given you three -- two daughters and a son. l grant you, the daughters show little promise.
Mary may grow to wisdom... but Elizabeth will never learn to rule so much as a kitchen.
Ah, but the boy's my second self.
True, sire, but a third self,
or even a fourth... would make all safe.
- What's your project then?
- The duchess of Cleves.
- Got a portrait of her?
- No.
Send Holbein over to paint her and peynell to watch Holbein.
Your Grace has no faith in German painters.
Yes, but l have no faith in German beauty.
[ Laughs ] peynell!
Your Majesty? l want you to go over to Cleves.
[ Exhales ] l might marry the duchess. l will not marry your king. l will not! l will not! l will not!
But there's not a princess in Europe who'd not be eager for such a match.
- What? That bluebeard?
- Oh, princess.
What else is he?
His first wife divorced, his second chopped, his third dead.
A pretty prospect for the fourth.
But she will not be Anne of Cleves, and that you may tell him.
- As you will, princess.
- And why ''princess''?
Last night you called me Anne.
Last night l forgot everything.
Today --
Today forget everything but last night.
How can l paint Her Highness if she will not sit?
When the light is good, she's always in the garden with Master peynell.
[ Laughs ]
Naturlich.
He talks with the tongue, but also with the eyes, that young man.
Until he came, she would not hear of this marriage.
But now all goes well. l think so. lsn't it?
For the marriage, maybe.
But what about the portrait, Your Grace?
Be patient. l will make it that she came already.
[ Coughing ]
May it please Your Grace, the duke wishes you to come at once.
Here she is.
Now, jetzt sitzen.
lch sitze schon.
[ Laughing ]
Oh, Your Highness.
Forgive me, but if the king were to see you with that face... it -- it wouldn't help on the marriage.
You think she is ugly, my face?
Only if Your Highness makes it so.
Holbein's masterpiece.
- The original is still in Calais?
- Afraid of the storm in the channel.
Well.
Hmm.
Hmm. What do you think of her?
- Oh, charming, Your Grace.
- [ Crowd Murmuring Agreement ] l was just saying, sire, what a face.
Yes. Well.
Hmm. Well, then.
Glad you all like her.
Little Katherine.
Well, what do you think of the new queen?
We're very sorry, sire, that Lady Anne cannot cross the channel.
Yes, l'm sorry too. l'm a lonely man.
- When are you going to sing for me again?
- Any time Your Majesty orders me.
- Tonight, in my rooms.
- Hardly the right place for singing,
Your Majesty.
Your rooms then. 1 1 :00.
Not a soul will see me.
[ Clears Throat ]
- Katherine, what was he saying to you?
- Who?
- The king.
- Nothing.
- Nothing? But l was watching.
- Oh, spying?
No, but when l see you making yourself cheap.
When you do, come and tell me.
Until then, keep your nose out of my affairs.
Katherine! please.
This velvet crushes so.

- Henry.
- Henry who?
- The king.
- Oh, the king, not the man.
- [ Doorknob Clatters ]
- Unlock the door. lsn't it rather late for a maid to unlock her door to a man?
- Oh, come on. Unlock the door.
- ls that a command?
- Yes!
- So the king then, not the man.
Don't do that. l'm leaving my crown outside.
You've left it outside with my reputation, sire.
No one saw me, little Katherine, l swear.
Can't you forget the king and forget the crown, forget everything?
You told me once l was a man, huh?
What do you say if l'm not the king?
- Get out of my room.
- What? Why --
That's what l would say
if you were not the king.
Since you are the king, l expect your command.
Command? lt's a poor thing to command in love.
- ln love? Who is in love?
- l am, with you.
Love eternal, since yesterday afternoon until tomorrow morning.
When l say love, l mean love.
Couldn't you love me, little Katherine? l can't love a man with a wife.
- l haven't got a wife.
- Lady Anne of Cleves?
Oh, that woman?
She's a picture. She's a por -- portrait.
Oh, no, Your Grace.
She is much more.
Where is the king?
You know?
- No, nor care.
- You're drunk!
The duchess of Cleves has crossed the channel, is on her way to Rochester.
- Find the king at once!
- That will be impossible, my lord.
Why?
[ No Audible Dialogue ] l'll find the king, my lord. l'll tell him.
Still afraid of me, little Kate?
Of you? No.
What are you afraid of then?
Of myself, perhaps.
- Who's that?
- [ Culpeper ] Message for the king.
Great news, Your Majesty.
Lady Anne of Cleves has crossed
the channel and is on her way to Rochester.
[ Grunts, Groans ]
Marvelous news.
[ Clears Throat ]
You were right, little Katherine.
She seems to be much more than a picture.
Here is -- How do you say?
A pretty kettle of fishes.
To be in love with one man and have to marry another.
- l know.
- What would happen if the king finds out?
We die.
But l don't mind.
Oh, but l do!
What is to be done?
What can be done?
Nothing.
How like a man to be dead before he is killed.
There is always a way out.
- What way?
- l don't know.
But l will find it.
Good morning, my Lord Bishop.
How is the princess?
[ Bishop ]
Expecting Your Majesty.
[ Grunts ]
One of you is not the princess, l presume.
- [ Together ] Oh, nein.
- Thank heaven for that.
[ Exaggerated Accent ]
Oh, Heinrich!
Welcome to England, madam. l fear you had a bad crossing.
Yes, the wind mit the sea make the trouble and --
[ Hiccups ]
Excuse me.
Be pleased to accept my most humble apologies.
Oh, but it is not your fault, the channel chopping.
Nevertheless, l deeply regret any inconvenience you may have been caused.
Oh, please! lt was only the waves come so high upstairs.
Quite.
Our channel can be very rough... when it isn't smooth!
Oh, it did. permit me to express the hope that a short rest will restore you to health, madam.
Thank you. l hope soon l shall eat again, yes?
By all means.
You have our permission to withdraw. please.
You!
So that's your idea of a pretty wo --
Why l don't strike you --
She's got a face like a --
Me that has never looked at a woman --
- What am l to do with her?
- l believed what l was told, sire.
Did you?
[ Grunting ] lt's all right for you.
You haven't got to marry her. l have.
- What do you wish me to do then?
- pack her back off to where she came from. lt would mean war, sire, and with all Europe against us.
This marriage must go on.
All right.
Heaven help you, Cromwell.
The marriage bed is made, l tell you!
Out you go! l won't! l won't! l won't!
- Woman, l stand here for the king.
- l stand for the duke of York.
The duke of York?
But we have no duke of York.
No, but you will have when my charm has done its work!
[ Laughing ]
Another charm.
No, the same charm that gave
England her prince of Wales.
- Oh, that was the king's doing.
- Was it?
Did the king have a son by his first wife? No!
Did the king have a son by his second wife? No!
And why?
'Cause you locked me out!
Bah!
You, to stand in England's way!
[ Exhaling ]

Oh! Oh. l don't know how l'm going to go through with this.
You can take a horse to the water, but you can't make it drink.
[ Exhales ] l don't know. l suppose it's gotta be done.
Give me my nightshirt.
[ peynell ]
His Majesty's nightshirt.
[ Groans ]
Nein.
Ja. That's right.
[ Coughs Delicately ]
The royal bedchamber is prepared.
[ Man ]
The royal bedchamber is prepared!
[ Man #2 ]
The royal bedchamber is prepared!
[ Man #3, Faint ]
The royal bedchamber is prepared.
Rosewater.
The things l've done for England.
[ Exhales ]
[ Exhales ]
Didn't they give you enough to eat, madam?
Don't shout at me just because l'm your wife.
My wife.
[ Chuckles ]
Not yet. poor Mother told me --
First, she says, the marriage is no good.
And then he cuts off the head
mit an ax-chopper.
That is an exaggeration, madam.
Then why do you say l am not yet your wife?
Well, um, madam, a marriage ceremony doesn't make us one.
- Mmm.
- Oh, yes, yes, yes. lt's all right, but you have to -- l have to -- we, uh --
What?
Did your mother not talk to you about --
What?
Oh, Lord.
Oh, well, uh --
Um, madam, all that stuff... about children being found under gooseberry bushes --
- That's not true.
- Oh, no. lt was the stork.
The stork?
The stork flies in the air
mit the babes... and down the chimney drops, eh?
No. No, madam.
Uh, that isn't true either.
When a hen lays an egg... it's not entirely all her own doing.
You mean sometimes it was the cuckoo?
Yes, it was the cuckoo.
- Do you sing?
- Nein. ln Germany, a respectable woman doesn't sing.
Then, of course, you don't play.
Oh, yes, l do.
- l'll go and get you a guitar.
- No, l play cards.
Cards? Well, that's something.
Uh, you'll find a pack in the chest over there. peynell, have a drink.
No, thanks.
What stakes shall we play for?
How about that?
Don't cry if you lose.
- Good?
- Better.
Huh! Beginner's luck.
[ Chuckles ]
- Stakes?
- Yes.
Don't cry if you lose.
You may not know it, madam, but l am considered the best card player in England.
[ Laughs ]
- [ Cards Slap Down ]
- Hmm.
Has anybody got any money?
Don't you understand the king's English? l said, money!
How much was it?
[ Anne ]
Ninety-five crowns.
You, run to the treasury and get some money!
- Your deal.
- Aren't you getting us some money?
Can't you give me five minutes' credit? l play for cash.
[ Grumbling ]
[ Shouts ]
Where's that money?
- [ Knocking ]
- Come in!
Where have you been?
Give me that money! Get out of here!
Now --
[ Grumbling Continues ]
- Cheating!
- Don't shout!
- l'm not shouting!
- You are.
Ah, what am l -- what am l going to do with you?
- Chop my head?
- probably.
- You daren't.
- Why not?
Because in Europe l will make such a scandal as you never heard. lt is not the first time you chop the head.
Henry the wife butcher -- that's what they will call you. l don't care what they say. l'm not going to live with you.
Well, why don't you divorce me like a gentleman?
Would you consent to a divorce?
l would consent to a divorce.
You're a very reasonable woman.
What are your terms?
- Two manors.
- Granted.
- Richmond and Blenchingley with properties.
- Granted.
- Four thousand pounds a year?
- Granted.
One of your gentlemen as master of my household.
- Take whom you want.
- peynell. peynell?
[ Giggles ] peynell.
Granted. ls it a bargain?
- Ja!
- [ Laughs ]
Confess that you cheated, or you'll go back to Germany!
Back to Germany?
[ Laughs ] Oh, l cheated!
[ Both Laughing ]
- Confess, though, that you cheated.
- What do you mean?
Didn't you hide Katherine Howard to play against my queen, huh?
- Oh, you knew about that all the time.
- Ja.
Ah, it'll only mean another scandal.
At last l've found a woman l can be faithful to.
After your divorce, they'll never consent to another marriage.
Oh, yes, l think so, in a little time, but l will help you.
You're the nicest girl l ever married.
[ Gasps ]
[ Yawning ]
Good night.
Gute Nacht.
Lovely weather for the time of year,
Your Grace.
- [ Sighs ] Yes.
- Will Your Grace be pleased to be shaved?
All right.
Uh --
Uh, do -- do you remember telling me that my loyal Guild of Barbers... thought l ought to marry again?
Forgive me, Your Grace.
We took a very great liberty, Your Grace.
Not at all. Very natural interest in the welfare of the country.
You are too kind, Your Grace.
- Are they still of the same opinion?
- Oh, no, indeed, Your Grace.
They realized their mistake.
- Was it a mistake?
- Oh, yes, Your Grace.
As l said at our last meeting, ''God knows the king's done his best to get more sons... but there comes a time in life when the well runs dry.''
- You said that, did you?
- [ Stammering ] Yes, l did, Your Grace.
- Get out!
- [ Whimpers ]
''The well runs dry.''
Hmph!
[ page ]
No good. He won't touch it.
Why? Whatever's wrong?
Everything.
He just sits and glares.
They're not trying to make him marry again. l'd like to see 'em, after that German business.
After all,
you can't say he hasn't tried.
Tried too often, if you ask me.
To say nothing of the side dishes -- a little bit of this, a little bit of that.
What a man wants is regular meals.
Yes, but not the same joint
every night.
- Ohh!
- [ Laughing ]
Oh, a man loses his appetite after four courses.
How do you mean, four courses?
He got into the soup with Katherine of Aragon... cried stinking fish with Anne Boleyn... cooked Jane Seymour's goose... and gave Anne of Cleves the cold shoulder.
God save him. lt's no wonder he suffers in the legs.
- Your Grace is sad tonight.
- What can we do to cheer Your Grace?
What could you do to cheer my loneliness?
Your Grace is lonely?
- Ah, that is the penalty of greatness, sire.
- Greatness? l would exchange it all to be my lowest groom who sleeps above the stable... with a wife who loves him.
[ Henry Exhales ]
Your Majesty, uh, there is one matter, one most urgent matter.
- l scarcely dare to broach it.
- [ Sighs ]
l would have waited for a happier moment,
but it is so pressing --
What is it?
Your Grace, your whole kingdom most urgently implores you to marry.
[ Scoffs ]
Oh, no, no.
Oh, no, no. No, no.
[ Laughing ]
Should l consent, it'd be only put down to desires of the flesh.
Never, Your Grace.
Your people know you too well.
That's what l mean.
Your Grace is pleased to jest... but the will of your people has always been your law.
And, Your Grace,
they want this marriage to a man.
[ Laughs ] l am not eager... but if all my people wish it, what can l do?
At least you have my promise to think it over.
Good night, my lords.
- [ Various Salutations ]
- please sit down.
[ Chattering, Murmuring ]
Katherine.
[ Chattering Continues ]
You know, my country is demanding a great sacrifice of me.
What is it, Your Grace?
The lords, the commons, the bishops, the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker... and even my Royal Guild of Barbers... are imploring me to marry again.
Really?
Will it be the French princess?
- No.
- The emperor's niece?
No.
An English girl.
[ Murmuring ] lf she loves me.
Does she, sweetheart?
[ Guests Chattering, Shouting ]
- The red!
- The black.
No! The red!
- The black.
- Come on!

- No! Red!
- Your favorite's doomed.
No, no. l bet another five pounds on him.
- Taken.
- Red! Come on!
Red! Red!
- [ Guests Cheering ]

Now l can't bet any more.
You've won my last crown.
Here, darling.

[ Cheering, Shouting Continue ]
Good bird, there, good bird.
Take it away.

Are you a better judge of men than of birds, little Kate? Huh? l bet 1 0 crowns on the taller of the two.
He must be the strongest man in all England.
Ho-ho! But one! The strongest man in England sits beside you.
- [ Chuckles ]
- Of course, darling. l know.
You've thrown every wrestler in your time. ln my time?
Hah!

You know that a wrestler who does not pit his whole strength against any man is punished by 30 lashes of the whip? l know, Your Grace.

- When?
-1 1 :00 tonight.
- The king.
- The king has just sent word not to expect him.
- Where?
- ln her room. l will take you to her.
[ Bell Tolling ] l thought you were never coming. l never should have come, Kate.
We can't go on like this. l know. lt's dreadful, seeing each other every day and never being alone together.
No, it's not that. lt -- lt's being torn in half between you and the king.
- But, Tom, we belong to each other.
- No.
We belong to him.
Don't you realize what l'm feeling, Kate?
For the king, yes.
But for me, what?
For you --
Have you ever stood on the edge of a cliff and looked over? lt draws you, tugs at you to hurl yourself down.
You know that if you look again you're -- you're gone.
Are you asking me to look again, Kate?
Are you?
Then --
Then this means g-good-bye. lt's the only way.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
[ Men Chattering, Laughing ]
[ Henry Chuckling ]
Wriothesley, Sir Thomas Wyatt is in the tower.
He wrote beautiful love poems.
Send word that they release him.
Yes, Your Grace.
And cancel all death sentences.
Yes, Your Grace.
[ Yawning ]
Good night, gentlemen.
- Good night.
- [ Men ] Good night, Your Grace.
[ Yawning Continues ]
[ Chuckling Continues ]
[ Sighs ]
Through how many blunders, stupidities and cruelties has a man to pass... before he finds his happiness in a wife?
Thank God he has given Your Majesty this happiness at last.
[ Chuckling ]
Love is drunkenness when one is young.
Love is wisdom at my age.
Life has found its meaning, Cranmer.
- Good night.
- Good night, Your Majesty.
- Take me with you.
- Where could we go?
His arm would reach us everywhere.
- [ Knocking ]
- [ Woman ] Katherine! Katherine!
The king is coming!
[ Footsteps Approaching ]
My little girl.
[ Chuckles ]
More and more charming every day.
You know, l couldn't resist coming to see you.
[ Chuckles ]
Do you know the Germans
offered me half of France if l join them?
[ Chuckles ]
And the French offered me Flanders.
They're very generous with each other's territory.
[ Chuckles ] ln my youth, in Wolsey's time, l would have accepted one offer or another.
But what's the use of new territories and wars, wars, wars again?
lf those French and Germans
don't stop killing each other... the whole of Europe will be in ruins. l want to compel them to keep peace, peace, peace.
[ Sighs ]
And there's no one in Europe to help me.
[ Laughs ]
My little girl! l'm boring you with business, and you're tired. Huh?
N-N-Now, y-you're very sleepy... and so am l.
Good night.
Sleep well.
[ Yawning ]
Mm-hmm. Sleep well.
[ Chuckles ]
Good night.
Lady Rochford, do you know what it means to be put on the rack?
Your bones will be broken piece by piece.
Wouldn't you rather tell us what you know about the queen and Thomas Culpeper?
No. Not the rack.
You conducted him to the queen for the first time when?
Six months.
[ Orchestra ]
[ No Audible Dialogue ]
[ Ends ]
Hmm!
What's the matter with all you young people?
Katherine, why aren't you dancing?
- You said you didn't want to dance.
- My leg's troubling me.
But that's no excuse for Thomas here.
Thomas! Go and dance with the queen.
- What do you think l keep you for?
- Hear! Hear! Your Grace.
- Will Your Grace care to dance?
- Will she care to dance?
Will she care?
[ Chuckling ]
[ Chuckles ]
[ Continues ]
- Darling.
- What? l adore you.
My lord, only you can tell His Majesty.
[ All Murmuring, Chattering ]
- You can.
- You must tell him. l can't.
Your Majesty's privy council awaits Your Majesty's orders.
- Ah, we'll finish this when l come back.
- Yes, Your Grace.
Forgive me, sweetheart!
Affairs of state!
The dance goes on.
[ Continues ]
[ Henry ]
Good evening, gentlemen.
Anything important today? l can't be long.
The queen's waiting for me.
Well, Mr. Secretary?
His Lordship, the archbishop of Canterbury...
has a matter of great importance
to submit to Your Majesty.
Cranmer?
- Your Majesty --
- Come along, Cranmer!
History teaches... even the scriptures tell us --
What is it?
[ Cranmer ]
Bad women of all times...
even those who wore crowns --
What is it?
[ Shouts ]
What is it?
What is it?
His Lordship was trying to fulfill the most painful duty of a loyal subject -- to tell the king that the queen had committed adultery.
- With whom?
- With Thomas Culpeper.
- You --
- [ Both Grunting ]
- [ Henry Shouting ]
- [ Wriothesley Gasping ] lt is proved, Your Majesty!
There are witnesses!
[ Gasping Continues ]
[ Wriothesley ]
The witnesses are Lady Rochford...
the three maids of the queen...
John Cornell...
the ladies Parnell...
Bascott and-- and Morton...
the queen's two pages...
and Culpeper's body servant.
[ Whimpering Softly ]

Katherine, why is there a council tonight?
French and German again, l suppose.
Who cares?
[ Ends ]
- [ Guard ] Who goes there?
- The watch.
- Whose watch?
- The king's watch.
God preserve the king!
[ Watchmen Affirming ]
[ Watchman ]
Midnight and all's well.
[ Chattering ]
Charles! Charles!
- Where are you?
- Here l am, darling.
- No places again.
- l'll find you some place, little one.
[ Single Loud Drumbeat ]
Katherine!
Katherine.
Mea culpa.
Mea culpa.
Mea maxima culpa.
Yes, yes, yes.
Mmm.
- Your Grace --
- Go away. l'm tired.
- l'll do no more business today.
- This is not business, Your Grace.
- The Lady Anne is asking for an audience.
- Anne? Anne?
The Lady Anne of Cleves.
Anne.
[ Chuckles ] Anne.
Uh, tell her come in.
Anne. Well. Anne.
[ Chuckling ]
Anne of Cleves.
Anne. Anne.
Anne -- Well, well, well!
- Well, Anne!
- Good morning, Your Highness.
Good morning, Your Highness.
- Well, how's life?
- Oh, it's rather sad, Anne.
- Oh, but why?
- l haven't got any friends, you know. l haven't got a wife.
Haven't got any love in my life.
Haven't got anything.
Not even hatred.
What you want is a good wife.
Wife?
[ Muttering ] l said a good one, not a spiteful one like the first... not an ambitious one like the second and not a stupid one like the third.
Not a card sharper like the fourth.
No, and not a very young one like the fifth. l said a good one.
Where do you find 'em?
- l'll show you.
- Hmm?
Katherine! Catch me!
Katherine!
[ Laughing ]
[ Kissing ]
Oh, Nurse! Don't you see?
Blow, darling.
There's a good boy.
- Oh, me too!
- But your face is quite clean, Elizabeth!
- Me too.
- Oh.
[ Giggles ]
- [ Fingers Snapping ]
- l know her.
- Um --
- Katherine parr.
Mmm. Katherine.
Katherine. No. No.
Katherine. Uh-uh.
No, Katherine, Katherine.
No, Henry, you're an easy-going man,
always getting yourself into trouble.
And who has to suffer,
l should like to know.
You go to Dover on these rainy days, you sit on your royal council... get fussy and excited over nothing at all and then come to me and get fussy.
l don't know what l'm going
to do with you, l'm sure.
What with one thing and another,
my life just isn't worth living.
lf l let you out of my sight for one moment
you're up to some mischief.
l had only to turn my back for five minutes
yesterday and you ate a whole saddle
of lamb.
And who had to nurse you when you had
the bellyache all through the nightlong? Me!
[ Scoffs ] l really don't know
what l'm going to do with you.
Oh, Henry, Henry, Henry!
You know you can't digest it.
Take it away!
And the drink.
Can't you hear what the queen tells you?
Take it away!
[ Catherine ]
And bring a blanket.
Now for a little nap.
[ Footsteps Receding ]
Six wives... and the best of them's the worst.
Wilt thou, Magdelana Borst...
take this man to thy wedded husband...
to love, comfort, honor and obey him, and forsaking all others... keep thee only unto him so long as ye both shall live?
I will.
Oh!
Wilt thou, Gilbert Martin, take this woman to thy wedded wife... to love, comfort and honor her... and forsaking all others, keep thee only unto her so long as ye both shall live?
- I will.
- Let us pray.
O Almighty God, look down upon and bless these two young people... as they go forth this day into the wilderness...
to make for themselves a new home.
Guide them,
Gracious Father... protect and keep them through all the trials and vicissitudes of life... that they may never cease to remember this hour... and this pledge of love which they have given, one to the other...
in thy sacred sight.
Amen.
And now, in the name of the Father... and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost,
I pronounce you man and wife.
What God hath joined together...
let not man put asunder.
Kiss her, my son.
- Lana! Lana, throw it!
- Good-bye.
- God bless you, Gilbert.
- Good-bye, sir.
- Good-bye, son.
Good-bye, Mrs. -
Mother.
- Take good care of her.
Wait till she sees this.
Good-bye. Good-bye.
- That sure was a nice weddin'.
- Wasn't it?
- The cow hitched easy?
- Cow?
- Giddyap.
- Mother, good-bye.
Bye.
- Good-bye.
- Oh, no, my friends.
It's always been like this since Bible days.
Every generation must make its own way in one place or another.
- It's the most beautiful country I've ever seen.
- I told you so.
The Mohawk Valley is the prettiest place in the whole country, for a fact.
Susie.
Gin.
Have one. Just especial, seeing it's tonight.
- You folks come far?
- Yes. Albany.
- Where?
- Albany!
- Albany.
- Yes.
Been married long?
Oh, not so long.
How long?
Not so long!
I- I thought that's what you said.
I knew it the minute
I laid eyes on ya.
Honeymooners.
You got it written all over both of you.
Honeymooners!
To your health, madam, sir.
You planning on settling here in the valley?
Yes. I have a place at Deerfield.
Deerfield? That's pretty far out of the way, isn't it?
Yes, but it suits me.
What political party do you folks up that way belong to?
The American.
Any Tories?
Not that I know of. Why?
Oh, nothing.
I was just wondering.
They say the Indians are going to line up with the British, but I suppose that's just talk.
Well, good night.
That's a queer one, ain't he?
Too many questions to suit me.
And that patch over his eye-
I bet he lost it trying to see something that wasn't none of his business.
Good night.
Good night now.
Good night.
You didn't get scared, did you, at what that fella just said... about the Tories and the Indians?
I wasn't even thinking about Indians.
What were you thinking about?
I was just wondering... if you love me as much as I love you.
Are there always flies like this?
In the real woods there are.
It must be gonna rain, though, the way these take hold.
You'll get used to 'em up here, though.
Lana, we're home now! Look!
I'll get a fire going.
It's just a cabin, but-
Well, I've always thought it would be nice living in a cabin.
It's so handy to look after things when it's small.
It seemed so fine to me because I built it.
I didn't realize it might look different to a girl... who'd been raised in a big house like yours.
Oh, it's all right, Gil.
Beginning this way... we'll like our things even better when we get them.
Oh, Lana.
Just wait till I put up the mare and we get something to eat and feel warmer. We'll-
Things will look different then.
You'd better take those wet things off, Lana.
You'll be sick.
No! Gil! Gil!
Gil! Gil!
Oh, Gil! Gil!
Gil! Gil!
- Get him! Do something!
- Why, Lana, that's only Blue Back.
- He'll murder us! He'll murder us!
- Lana, stop that!
Gil-
I'm sorry, Lana.
I had to do it.
You've gotta get a hold of yourself.
This is my wife, Blue Back.
She's kind of nervous and tired out.
We had a long, hard trip in the rain and everything.
Sure. Much rain.
I guess she didn't expect anybody to drop in at a time like this.
Me go hunting.
Bring you half deer. Hang outside.
Half deer, huh? Well, that's mighty fine of you, Blue Back. Thanks.
Sit down. I got some rum outside.
We'll have a drink together.
No. Me go now.
Come back again, maybe.
Sure, any time.
- You're a good friend, Blue Back.
- Sure, fine friends.
Good Christian!
Hallelujah!
Lana.
- I'm going home.
- Home?
I can't stand it!
Mother was right.
I'm no frontier woman.
I had no idea it was like this.
I hate it!
- Lana, what are you saying?
- You had no right to bring me here!
It- It's awful! And that horrible man- that Indian slipping in here.
Now you're acting crazy again.
Blue Back wouldn't hurt you.
- Why, he's as good a Christian as you or me, maybe better.
- I don't care!
- I'm going home. I'm going now! Gil!
- No, you're not.
You're gonna stay right here and do as I say from now on.
You're gonna get over this foolishness and stop being scared. Do you understand?
Lana, I didn't wanna hit you.
I had to do it.
Lana, look at me.
I love you.
I need you.
I can't live without you now.
You know that.
Yes.
Look, here's Blue Back again, see?
You got a fine woman.
But you young man.
You use this on her.
Lick her good!
Make fine woman.
What are you thinking about now?
Gil.
What are you thinking about?
Oh, I was just thinking about what this place is gonna look like couple years from now.
Next summer we can start building a barn, right on that slope over there.
A hillside barn, just like I've always wanted.
Then after that, we can start thinking about building a decent house.
I like our house just as it is now.
Oh, sure. But I always remember how you ladies hanker after frame houses.
Well, I suppose the place will look so beautiful you won't care what your wife looks like.
I can get blisters all over my hands, and my nose peeled... and that's the thanks
I get for it.
Let's see some of those blisters you're talking so big about.
No! No, never mind! Leave me alone.
Let it go.
Why, Lana, your hand is sore.
- Maybe you oughtn't come out here like this.
- I want to.
I know, but haying's hard work.
It's about the hardest work there is.
It's... no job for a woman.
Oh, now, there you go.
Just because a woman is raised in a town, she has to be frail.
I'm not. I'm strong. You said yourself you couldn't have done without me.
- I sure married myself some good hired help.
- No, no! Now stop.
Stop it yourself.
Do you like me as much as you do your old farm?
- Good morning, ladies.
- Hello, Gil.
- Hello.
- Good morning, Gil.
- Hello, Gil! Good morning, Lana!
- Good morning.
Joe.
Mighty pretty.
- Oh, General Herkimer.
- Hello, Martin.
This is my wife, Lana.
Ja. Ja. Hübsch.
She's as pretty as the near side of a peach.
Maybe prettier.
- Reall.
- And, Lana, this is Mrs. Weaver and her husband.
I'm your nearest neighbor.
I've been meaning to call... me and George and John here, my boy.
- How do?
- I'm so glad to meet you.
And this is Christian's wife, Mrs. Reall, and her daughter Martha Ellen.
- How do you do?
- Howdy. And this is my oldest girl, Mary.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hello, Mrs. Martin.
- And Mrs. Demooth.
- My husband is the captain.
How do you do?
- Oh, how do you do?
- And Dr. Petry.
How do, Mrs. Martin?
Oh, pass the lot of 'em.
Um-
Fall in! Outside.
All right, men.
Hup! Hup!
Hup! Hup! Hup!
Hup! Hup!
Hup! Hup!
Don't be afraid of these women, Mrs. Martin.
You'll find they're good neighbors... once they get over being mad at you for being so pretty.
- Oh, don't be so silly.
- That bonnet you got on is giving them a lot of worry.
And they're dying to shoo us men off... so they can find out if you and Gil have got a family on the way.
- Oh, Nicholas Herkimer!
- We weren't gonna tell anybody.
- Lana!
Oh, that's just fine.
- Congratulations, Martin.
- Thank you.
That's just fine. A baby.
You know, I don't believe in young folks waiting.
- I always say a man needs help on his place...
- Stick out your tongue.
And the only way to get it is to have children, especially boys.
- Why, Maggie Weaver, how awful.
Militia, fall in!
- Fall in what?
Attention.
Dress to the right.
- That's my husband.
Call the roll.
- Amos Brock.
- Here.
- John Weaver?
- Here!
- George Weaver.
- Here.
- Gilbert Martin.
- Here.
Christian Reall.
Christian Reall!
Christian-
That's me. Here.
- Adam Hartman.
- Here.
- James McNod.
James McNod!
He couldn't come today.
He had to go and buy flour.
Then I've got to fine him.
That's the law.
It don't look to me as though you had any right to fine a man for not coming if he can't!
I thought that's what this war was about- making people pay taxes when they didn't have no say-so about it.
That's right. That's what
I'm carrying Long Tom for.
Ain't up to me.
Talk to the general.
Oh, I guess we can let that go this time.
And that's enough of the roll call too.
You can check up later.
Stand at ease, men.
Neighbors... ever since New York and the 12 colonies signed the Declaration of Independence... this revolution has turned into a real war.
So far we've been lucky up here in the Mohawk...
but it looks like we are going to be dragged into it too.
Sure as shootin'.
That's why I got you here- to get ready, no matter what happens.
I guess we all feel the same way about it.
This is our home and our land.
And I say it's worth fighting for... only we got to do it by ourselves.
Congress can't help us.
They say Washington needs all the troops he can get... and that the frontier will have to look out for itself.
Maybe them regular soldiers don't like the kind of liquor we drink up here, huh, General?
Adam!
Maybe not, but that's what they say.
Now, about the Indians, from all I hear... the Tories are making them a lot of big promises.
We got our agents working too, but there's no telling which way they'll jump.
Oh, I don't think we'll have any trouble with the Indians.
- We've always treated them fair.
- That's right.
Maybe so, but just the same... if you hear the bell ringing at the fort or the cannon go off... you drop everything and come running.
Do you understand?
All of you, come running.
Else I have you flogged so fast you won't know what.
Now, come on. Show the women how good you can drill.
- Take them around the field, Captain.
- Attention!
Nice talk, Nicholas.
Carry arms!
Forward left, march!
All right!
By thunder, I'll bet we can lick the whole world the way we march.
Ezra, help us over here!
Coming right along with you, Gil.
Put it right on top.
Look out now.
Come on! Come on!
Now she's going good.
- How is the core- pretty rotten, Adam?
- Yeah.
- Try to fall it right down in there.
- All right.
Keep working on the edge. That's the idea.
This'll make a nice patch for wheat, Gil.
You got good soil here.
I figure the loam's close to four feet.
Yes, sir, I bet there isn't any better soil in the whole valley.
You're just a natural-born farmer, ain't ya?
So you'd be, if you'd marry and settle down.
There she goes!
There she goes.
That's gonna be good firewood.
There it goes.
Start heaving, Cleave.
- Push her in, Gil.
- Push her in there.
Yeah, get on out!
- Make it straightaway.
- Heave!
Heave! Heave!
Come on! Come on.
You certainly brought a lot of pretty things with you, Mrs. Martin.
- Heavenly.
- I told Mother there was no sense in bringing... a lot of clothes and such things.
I'd rather have the money spent on furniture.
- I see you've got one of these feathers.
- Yes.
Mother had five of them at home.
She said there are times in a woman's life... when something like that is more important than bread.
- What in the world is it?
- A pheasant's feather.
Looks like it came out of an angel's wing.
We had a lot of them at home, but they collected so much dust, we threw them out.
Yes.
This is a nice teapot.
What is it, Wedgwood?
I don't know.
It's just white china, I guess.
- It belonged to my grandmother.
- We always ate off Wedgwood at home.
- Eat?
- Come on out! They've started burning already.
- Great burning. Started it myself.
- Come on.
Let's go see the burning.
Come on.
Throw it on there.
Gil, it's going to be beautiful.
It's Blue Back!
Indians on the warpath.
Coming.
Eight white men...
100 Indians.
Painted. Better hurry.
- Johnny Weaver, get your horse and tell General Herkimer.
Stop it! Stop it!
- Gil!
- Take this, Gil.
- Thanks, Joe. Adam, watch out for Lana, will you?
- Come on, Lana.
- No.
- You go too. Senecas, they kill.
I can't leave my place, the crops.
Gil, you've got to. You've got to come.
I won't leave without you.
All right, I'll get the cart.
Indians. I know. Get.
Two, three, four-
Two, three- One-
Four, five, six-
Come on, Christian.
They're all here. Get in your wagon.
- Here!
- Thanks.
Gil, the cow, aren't we going to take her?
We can't take her.
She'll just slow us up.
Oh, Gil, I can't stand it.
It's like leaving part of ourselves.
Don't look back. Giddyap!
- Come on, Mary.
- Hurry up, Gil!
Come on, Gil!
- Mr. Martin!
- Whoa!
Come on, Mary!
- Wait a minute.
- Where's the rest of your family?
- I don't know. I lost them.
- Give her to me.
Come on. Hurry up!
- All right.
- Giddyap, Susie!
Get!
We got Mary and Martha with us.
Get 'em in, Christian.
Climb right in the wagon here.
Come on, Trudy. You help Mary.
- Trudy, where's Nancy?
- Here she is.
- Where's Martha?
- Here's Martha.
- We're gonna have to throw some of this furniture out.
- Oh, no, Gil!
We've got to.
- We're ready, Gil.
- I told you not to look back.
Keep up there. Keep up there.
- Come on. Pull ahead there.
Mr. Martin!
- You got her?
- Yeah.
Gil! Gil, what's happened?
Oh! Mary Johnson!
- Come on! Come on!
- She was driving, and all of a sudden she fainted.
Never mind. There.
Put her down.
- Get up and get out of here!
- I won't! My husband's the captain.
- Get out before I use a strap on you.
- No!
Get some hot water, and tell that fool doctor to hurry.
- I don't understand. It's not like Lana.
- Never mind. She'll be all right.
- What in thunder's the matter here?
- Oh, Doctor.
- More sniveling women.
- It's my wife. She fainted.
I can't say I blame her, all this racket.
Gil. Gil Martin.
They're waiting for you, Gil.
The company's ready to go.
- What is it, Doctor?
- Nothing you can do anything about.
Go on. Get out of here.
- How is she, Gil?
- I don't know.
- Everything ready, Demooth?
- Yes, sir.
Drummer boy, play the drum.
Men, follow me!
Adam, did you see them?
Did you catch them?
No. We chased them seven, eight miles, but they got away from us.
- What happened?
- The excitement and all that jolting was too much for her.
Oh, but don't fret too much.
You're both young.
You'll have another baby.
Oh, she's all right now.
Just tired.
But don't let her talk too much.
Lana?
Gil.
Oh, Lana, darling.
Gil, our house?
They burned it.
- The crops?
- Everything. I saw it coming back.
Oh, and now-
Please don't, Lana.
- I failed you, Gil.
- No.
No, Lana, it wasn't your fault. It-
It just happens that way sometimes.
My poor Gil.
Oh, Lana.
You're all right.
That's all I care about.
It doesn't seem possible people can work as hard as we did, Lana... for nothin'.
We can build it back again, Gil.
We still have the land.
You think I'd let you come back out here and go through that sort of thing again?
No, you were right that first night.
You should have gone home then.
I was a fool not to see it.
- Gil.
- I never should have brought you out here in the first place.
This is no place for you.
It's no place for any woman.
I'm not the only woman who's gone through this, Gil.
What'll we do?
How will we live?
Well, Adam says that Mrs. McKlennar's hired man ran off... and she's looking for a couple to work her place.
But, Lana, why, you can't hire out!
A girl like you?
Do you think I'd-
It wouldn't have to be for long.
Just until we made enough to come back here and start.
Lana, you can't do it!
Oh, Gil, it won't do any harm just to talk it over with her.
No! Hired help.
No.
Mrs. McKlennar.
Good morning.
- Your name Martin?
- Yes, ma'am.
Well, go on and stare.
I know how I look.
When that fool hired man of mine got drunk and ran off... he left me with everything to do.
Martin, I don't mind a man having his liquor, so long as he knows how to hold it.
When it fixes him so's he can't do his work... then he'd better go someplace else, and the quicker the better.
Well, don't stand there with your mouths open.
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.
Now you're here on business, so let's get down to it. You know how to farm?
- I had my own place.
- Yes, I heard it was burned.
Well, that's too bad, but that's neither here nor there.
Daisy! Get my dinner ready.
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
I don't do much farming here.
Just take care of the meadow and feed my stock.
But you can do what you like.
I'm a widow.
My husband was
Captain Barnabas McKlennar.
Barney.
Barney.
What was I saying?
Oh. I was brought up on army life... so when I give an order,
I expect to get it obeyed.
- What?
- If I take your pay, I'll do the best I can.
Well, I just don't want you coming around afterwards complaining. That's all.
How much do you want?
I never worked for anybody else.
What'd you expect to pay?
Forty-five pounds a year- your house, the wood and food.
If your wife can sew, I'll pay her too.
Can you sew, you, what's your name?
- Lana.
- Well, can you sew?
- Yes.
- Speak up! Speak up! You want to sew for me?
- Yes, I'd like to.
- Well, let me see your hands.
Let me see your hands.
Hmm.
That's settled.
I hate sewing myself.
Hate any housework.
So I do the barn and let Daisy do the cooking.
I took good care of my husband.
Now he's gone, I do as I like.
I've got a long face and I poke it where I please.
- You may think I'm a nuisance.
- Yes, ma'am.
What? A nuis-
What? What'd he say?
I didn't mean it.
But I guess if you do poke, I'll think so.
Ah.
Well, your thoughts are your own property,
Martin, but keep 'em to yourself.
Come on. I suppose you want to see your new home.
I'll expect you to use the back door if you want to ask me for anything.
I don't want mud tracked through my house.
I track enough myself.
A mess now.
After that man.
- But it's a good house.
- It sure is, ma'am.
Nice chimney, nice bedroom upstairs.
I used to live here myself... till Barnabas took it into his head to build that stone place.
It's a beautiful house.
Glad you got sense enough to see it.
Now there's one more thing
I want to ask you. Got any furniture?
We have a bed and a few things.
Well, I'll help you out with the rest.
You can consider the job yours, Martin.
Now, any questions you want to ask?
Yes, ma'am.
It's- I just-
- Well, what? What?
- Well, do you belong to the right party?
Right party!
Martin, a woman hasn't got any political opinions.
I run this farm to suit myself.
I'll shoot the daylights out of anybody-
British, Indian or American- that thinks he can come around here monkeying in my business.
- Does that satisfy you?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Well, when can you move in?
- Well, will tomorrow be too soon?
To-Tomorrow?
What's the matter with today?
- Oh, we'll move in today!
- Good. Good.
- Oh, Lana.
- Oh, Gil!
Oh, Gil. Oh!
Oh, Gil, it- it's a beautiful fireplace.
Hear me, O Lord
And that anon
To help me
Make good speed
Be thou my rock
And house of stone
My fence in time
Of need
Amen
O Almighty God... hear us, we beseech thee... and bring succor and guidance... to those we are about to bring to thy divine notice.
First, we are thinking of Mary Wollaber.
She is just 16 years old... but she is keeping company with a soldier from Fort Dayton.
He's a Massachusetts man,
O Lord... and thou knowest no good can come of that.
Hallelujah!
Now we are thinking of the sick and infirm.
Peter Paris has the flux real bad.
His Uncle Isaacs, who keeps the store in Dayton... asks for our prayers.
And he says that he has just got in a new supply... of calicos,
French broadcloths...
- fancy handkerchiefs, new hats and heavy boots...
- Shh.
All at bargain prices.
But most of all... we call upon thee, Lord Jehovah...
O God of battles... to aid thy people against the Tories... for I have disturbing news for you that will sorrow this Sabbath.
General Washington has advised us... that an enemy army of many Tories and savage Indians... is even now on its way to our beloved valley.
Every man capable of bearing arms... between the ages of 16 and 60...
will report tomorrow morning to General Herkimer...
at which time, a regiment... of Washington's continental army... will arrive from Albany... under the command of Colonel Fischer to help us.
Any man failing to report for duty will be promptly hanged.
Amen.
You stick close to Mrs. McKlennar,
Lana, and do what she says.
Yes, Gil.
Well, I'd better go now.
Watch out for those new apple trees.
Gil.
Thank you, ma'am.
It used to be Barney's, but it's no use to me now.
Might come in handy to you.
Gil Martin, I'm gonna kiss ya, so I better do it now... so's you won't go off with the taste of a widow on your mouth.
Many's the time
I've seen Barney go off... just that same way.
Good-bye. He's off.
Sometimes he'd wave.
Ten-to-one he wasn't even seeing me.
He was thinking about all those men, you see- all those men going out to fight- to kill or be killed.
Blast his eyes, loving it.
So they sent you all the way over here to tell us to come inside the fort, did they?
It's orders. Where women and children shall be gathered together, it says.
Me and other men over 60 are to collect and protect 'em.
You old rooster.
Don't you think I can look after myself?
Yes, ma'am.
But it's orders.
I been saving a corner shed for you.
Shed! Do I look like the kind of a woman... that would start living in a shed at my time of life, like a cow?
- Yes, ma'am.
- What?
- No, ma'am.
- Go on, spit, man. Spit and get it over with.
Hey! Not there! Outside! Go on.
Get on out of here. Go on.
The old fool.
He can't even spit by himself.
Waiting, waiting.
That's all we women do, is wait.
Well, no news is good news.
Why don't you sit down, Lana?
Mosquitoes!
Mrs. McKlennar! Lana!
Here they come!
Come on out!
Here they come!
Where's John?
Have you seen Gil Martin?
Gil.
Take them inside. Go in. Anyone else, go in.
Have you seen Gil Martin?
I'm Robert Johnson, ma'am. Surgeon pro tem of the 1st Regiment, New York line.
Then don't stand there yapping about it.
Go on in and see the general.
Yes, ma'am.
Mark, where's Gil?
Gil Martin?
Gil! Gil!
Gil!
Gil-
I'm Captain Morgan, ma'am.
There's nobody back of me alive.
No.
Well, General Herkimer, a fine mess you've got yourself into this time.
I tell this fellow to go away.
Look after the young ones.
Shut up! You're not giving orders in this house.
What about it?
It's- It's already mortified, ma'am.
I- It'll have to come off.
- Ja, bitte?
- Ja, Nicholas.
- Wait till I light my pipe.
- Yes.
Look out. John!
Tell me something first, Doctor.
Did you ever cut off a leg before?
Why-Why, no, sir. I-
Well, don't be ashamed.
A man has gotta start somewhere.
I'll never forget the first deer I shot.
Gil?
Gil?
- Lana? Lana.
Gil! Gil.
Oh, thank God! Gil.
It's so cold.
Colder here than the woods.
Yeah.
Raining-
Lying there-
I remember thinking how hot it was... wondering-
- I'm cold.
- Yes, dear.
Wondering how long we'd be away... when it happened.
- I heard a crackling...
- Daisy. Daisy, some water.
Like a stick breaking... and all of sudden, the fella next to me stopped talking... and fell over on his side.
Then I heard a whistle.
Shots from everywhere.
Somebody shouted we'd been ambushed.
- I saw General Herkimer slide off his horse...
- Oh.
And grab his knee.
Peter Ten Eyck with his head blown half-off.
Oh, darling, this is going to hurt.
- Somebody told me to lay down...
And then I saw 'em... all smeared with paint- yellow and red- every color.
Oh, darling, I'm sorry.
In back of 'em,
Tories with green coats.
I got down back of a log and aimed at a fella.
He leaped straight up in the air.
- Darling, don't talk about it.
- He fell forward on his face.
- After that we...
Just kept shootin' as fast as we could load... for I don't know how long.
Amos-
Adam Hartman came over beside me.
His musket was broke.
But he had a spear.
He kept grinnin'.
I remember thinkin'...
"He's havin' a good time.
He likes this."
Pretty soon he pointed off.
- I saw an Indian comin' towards us, naked.
- Darling, don't talk.
I tried to load, but it was too late.
Adam stood up and braced his spear... and the Indian came down.
I never saw a fella look so funny, so surprised.
He just... hung there... with his mouth open... lookin' at us and not sayin' a word.
- I had to shoot him.
There wasn't anything else to do.
- Oh.
- I had to!
- Yes, dear.
- Brandy, Nicholas?
- Ja, ja.
Swallow. Swallow.
- Now, Nicholas?
Go ahead.
Then it started to rain... and I was sick.
All the time General Herkimer just sat there smoking his pipe and holding his knee.
Then he said we'd all better go home.
Oh, darling, don't talk about it.
Out of 600 of us... about 240 were still alive... but we'd won.
- We licked 'em.
- Yes, darling.
- We showed 'em they couldn't take this valley.
- Yes, darling.
- Lana?
- Yes, dear.
Do you hear? We'd won.
Yes, darling. You won.
Now you've got to sleep, Gil. You-
Adam. Adam, help me get him down.
- Get that pack there.
- Uh-huh. Yes.
- Here.
Sleep, darling.
You sleep.
Lana?
- Lana?
Oh, Gil. Gil.
I feel as if I've been asleep forever.
You needed it.
I've been lyin' here lookin' at you... thinkin' how pretty you are.
Oh, darling.
Made me think of the first days we had together at Deerfield.
I've been thinking about that too- the things we'd planned.
While I was out there...
I kept thinking about you all the time- about how good it'll be when everything's over and we can go back home.
Gil, the Indians-
They won't be coming back this way again, will they?
Oh, I don't reckon they'd have the nerve after the lickin' we gave 'em.
Why?
We're going to have another baby.
Are you glad, Lana?
I feel as-
I feel as though
I'd just begun to live all over again.
Are you hungry?
Doctor, how is General Herkimer?
General Herkimer is dead.
We couldn't stop the bleeding.
"'I am the resurrection, and the life, 'saith the Lord.
- "He that believeth in me...
"though he were dead,
:
And whosoever liveth and believeth-"
"I know my redeemer liveth...
"and that he shall stand at the latter :
"And though after my skin worms destroy this body...
yet in my flesh
I shall see God. "
Come on, Gil.
Don't stop now.
You know what Doc Petry said about havin' plenty of hot water on hand.
I know, but the water's boiled away twice already, and nothing's happened yet.
I don't know why we gotta have so much hot water when babies are born anyhow.
Mr. Martin! Mr. Martin!
Miss McKlennar wants you at once!
Gil! Gil.
One of Barney's soldiers made this cradle.
Give it to me the night we were married.
Your Lana might as well have it.
- Hmm?
- That's mighty kind of you, ma'am.
Oh, nonsense!
What good is it to me?
Can't ever tell. A good lookin' widow like you.
Ah, shut up.
You make me sick.
- Great big good-for-nothing loudmouthed fool!
- Even if you are good lookin'! Ooh!
- Stop!
- Get out of my way!
- Ooh.
- Oh!
Oh! Poor Gil.
- Not yet, boys. Not yet.
- Huh?
- No.
It's the waiting around that-
Not knowing what's going on.
Why can't Dr. Petry do somethin'?
Why can't he?
I don't know, Gil.
Blue Back, you've had a lot of experience in this business. What do you think?
Having babies, that's woman's business.
She better go far, far by herself.
Leave husband alone!
Daisy!
Daisy, hurry with those things.
This is terrible.
Gil! Gil Martin!
Get some hot water, quick!
- That's all right. That's all right.
George Weaver, you keep away from that springhouse.
Uh, I'll get some-
I'll get some more wood.
It's a boy.
Praise be to the Lord.
A boy. Gil. Gil!
It-It- It's a-
- It's a boy.
- It's a boy.
It's a boy.
Joe, we got a boy!
- Give me that.
Mmm.
Christian, it's a boy.
We got a baby boy.
- What?
- A baby boy!
- A boy?
- Yes!
- A baby boy?
- Sure!
And to think, at my age... another son.
- Get some brandy.
- Yes, sir.
- Brandy? For a little-
- No. For you.
Go on in.
- Is- Is she all right?
- Fit as a fiddle.
- Well, who does he look like?
- He's gonna faint. He's-
Oh, Lana, never again.
Gil.
I prayed so hard it would be a boy.
Take him in your arms, just for a moment.
Oh-
Go ahead.
Doggone.
Well, I'll be doggoned.
Yoo-hoo!
Come on, everybody! The dance is starting.
- Come on.
- I'll bet Barney never kissed you like that!
Barney McKlennar was a real man.
When he kissed you, you stayed kissed.
Let's see if he taught you how to hold your liquor.
He didn't need to.
I was born knowing that.
Hooray!
To the greatest crop in the Mohawk Valley and the man who's responsible for it...
Gil Martin!
To the bride and groom,
Mary and John Weaver.
May they always be as happy as they are tonight.
Please, God.
Please let it go on like this forever.
Come on, Gilly.
You're gonna help Mommy find some nice wild honey.
Upsy-daisy. Come on.
There we go.
- That you, Daisy? Go away. Go away.
What do you want?
What are you doing here?
Answer me! What do you mean coming in my house?
Burn house. Fire quick.
Don't you dare, you filthy drunken rascal!
Ah! Get out of here quick before I skin you alive.
Get out of here!
What are you doing?
My bed!
Ah, you crazy horse thieves!
If I could get my hands on a butcher knife!
Daisy! Daisy! Lana! Gil! Gil!
- My bed! Take your hands off that bed!
Take your- Oh!
- You go quick, old woman! You catch fire!
- Old woman!
I won't move a step without my bed.
- My husband bought this bed the day after I was married-
Stop that! Shame on you.
Get this bed out of here quick.
- Quick! Get this out of here!
- Sure. Fine. We take bed.
- Hurry up! Hurry up!
Quick! Hurry up, you fools!
I'll have your ears lopped off for this.
- Ah! Put it out!
You fools! Upside down.
Turn it upside down.
Turn it upside down.
- Turn it up! Turn it up-
You fools!
- Mrs. McKlennar! Mrs. -
- Oh! Mrs. McKlennar! What are you doing?
What are you doing?
- Away! Away!
- You've got to get out!
- Go away! Go away!
My husband built this house. I've lived in it all my life, and I'm not going to leave it.
- Go away. Go away.
- You've got to come!
- Listen to me! You cannot stay-
- Lana!
- Gil! Gil. Gil.
- Go away and leave me alone, Gil.
- Mrs. McKlennar!
Lana! Gil!
Gil! Lana! Andrusville has just been wiped out.
There's over a thousand of ‘em headed this way under Caldwell. You've got to get to the fort!
Take him. Mrs. McKlennar, you've got to come!
- I'm not leaving this house.
I've lived in it all my life.
- Come on, Sarah.
Go away! Hartman, leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
Oh, Almighty God... by whose divine assistance
Samson did smite the Philistines... hip and thigh with great slaughter... help thy people now gird up their loins for the coming battle.
Put courage in our hearts, Lord...
that we may drive our enemies back into the wilderness.
For we all know only too well what will happen to us...
if these sons of Belial ever get over these walls... or come in through that gate... which, with thy permission, Lord...
I now order closed.
Amen.
Close the gate.
Tether all the animals or drive 'em out!
You women and children, go into the church.
Hallelujah, men!
- Let's go!
If you can't get your hair under those hats, cut it off!
It won't do any good anyhow if those greasy devils get in here.
- Daisy. Daisy.
- Now sing, children. Sing in praise of the Lord.
Woman!
Brother Reall!
Put down that devil's brew.
I was only trying to get rid of it... so- so's them heathens wouldn't get it.
Beware of the heathen within thine own breast. Cast it away!
- Hallelujah!
Hallelujah.
Do you think they'll attack tonight?
With Caldwell leadin' 'em they will.
Look. What's that?
That's them.
Alarm!
- There goes our barn, off to the right of those trees.
- There goes my place.
- No, that's Ritter's.
Then mine's next to it.
Hold your fire, John. Save your ammunition.
They're just trying to draw us out.
Back to your place.
Martin's right.
Trust in the Lord, and wait until you can make every shot count.
You filthy painted heathens.
Consume them, Lord... as thou didst thine enemies in the days of Jeremiah.
Pastor! Gil! Adam!
- Wait till they're close, men!
- Adam! Here they come!
Ready with those rifles, women!
God have mercy on his soul.
I must be shooting a little to the left.
Here you are, George!
Loaded.
Now shoot the breeches off them, if they're wearin' breeches. Daisy, come on!
Loaded.
Chain shot.
Get to the gate!
Call the filthy beggars back.
We'll wait till the moon sets.
Oh, Barney! Barney, if you were only here, we'd show 'em.
We'd show-
Hold me up.
I can't breathe... lying down.
- Ah.
Lana, come beside me.
- Give me your hand.
Now don't start tuning out.
I want you and Gil to have my place- everything.
You've been like my own flesh and blood.
Oh.
Look under the front porch.
I buried... some gold pieces there, just in case.
Divide it up among the lot of you.
Gil.
Good-bye, good-lookin'.
Barney.
Barney!
- Oh!
For thine is the kingdom... the power and the glory... forever.
- Amen.
How's the ammunition, Parson?
Mighty low.
Ammunition's mighty low, Lord.
- I go Fort Dayton for help.
- That's a job for me.
- No, I'll go.
I know every foot of the way.
Anybody can make it, I can.
Joe.
Joe.
Parson, do you mind?
He'll need it.
Oneida Trail, huh, Joe?
Good luck, Joe.
He got away.
Listen.
Adam!
That's shooting, Adam!
You filthy murderers!
Just leave him-
God, our merciful father... forgive me for what
I am about to-
Amen.
Get away. I'm all right.
Gil.
What about-
Somebody's-
I'm going, Parson.
Good luck, Gil.
- Joe, did he-
- He did not.
- I'm gonna try it myself, Lana.
- Gil.
If I can make the woods,
I can outrun 'em.
They'll kill you.
You're not going to be afraid, you hear?
You're not going to.
- They'll kill you.
- No, they won't.
If I can get in the clear, there isn't an Indian living that can catch me.
Say you're not afraid and you want me to go.
Lana.
I'm not afraid.
I want you to go.
Lana, he got away.
Let 'em start.
Any sign of them yet?
Blue Back says it's quiet- too quiet out there.
He left before sunrise.
It's almost 12:00 now.
If he had reached Fort Dayton, help would be here by now.
Parson! They're over the wall!
- Every man to his post!
Pull!
Have you seen Lana?
No, I ain't, Gil.
Parson, have you seen Lana?
I killed a man.
- Lana. Lana.
It's me. It's Gil.
Oh.
Where's Caldwell?
- Where's Caldwell?
Where's Caldwell?
- Come on! Hey!
Squad left!
March!
Company halt!
- Order arms!
- At ease.
- Where are you men going?
- Home.
- Home?
The war's over. Cornwallis surrendered to Washington at Yorktown last week.
So that's our new flag, the thing we've been fighting for.
Thirteen stripes for the colonies... and 13 stars in a circle for the union.
It's a pretty flag, isn't it?
Hey, soldier, let me take that flag a minute.
- We did a little fightin' around here ourselves.
- Way up high.
- Put it up there!
- Way up to the top!
- Take it up!
- Put it up there!
Well, I reckon we better be gettin' back to work.
There's gonna be a heap to do from now on.
My name's lan Christie and I'll be your guide through this commentary on the film that
Michael Powell considered his first really independent production.
I'm joined by Thelma
Schoonmaker-Powell, Michael's widow, who was with him during the years of his rediscovery by new generations of film enthusiasts and film makers, including Martin Scorsese, one of Powell and Pressburger's greatest admirers.
Thelma has worked for over 20 years as Scorsese's editor, so she'll be bringing her practised eye to bear on some sequences from a film that's now nearly 70 years old.
We're also delighted to have as a guest Daniel Day-Lewis, who'll be reading from
Michael Powell's remarkable book originally called
200,000 Feet On Foula, which was published to coincide with the film's release in 1938.
Powell had the idea for the film as far back as 1930, when he read about the final evacuation of the Hebridean island of St Kilda, off the northwest of Scotland.
Now, on a different island,
Foula, up in the Shetlands, he was about to bring it to life.
Michael Powell played the visiting yachtsman himself, along with his future wife,
Frankie Reidy.
And their yacht was borrowed from the actual owner of the island,
Alastair Holborn.
He decided that they should play these parts to keep the budget down and not to have any more superfluous people on what would be a difficult location shoot.
It was particularly difficult because they weren't able to shoot on the original island of St Kilda.
The owner of St Kilda had decided it was going to be a bird sanctuary, so he didn't want a film crew invading the island.
All this was my doing.
From Elstree to Foula, over 800 miles of land and sea, many people's lives were being transformed because seven years ago
I had read a paragraph in a Sunday newspaper.
A little interest item stuck in my head and became a story.
Because of that idea,
24 intelligent men, who had never been very far away from a pavement, were going to be dropped down on an extremely isolated island, there to live and work for five months.
(Dialogue) Your book was right when it was published, Mr Graham.
But you were wrong when you said nothing changes on these islands.
There is not a living soul now on Hirta.
The island itself is very isolated from the mainland, way out in the Atlantic, really probably the last part of the United Kingdom.
It's interesting how, early on, with these images of an eagle about to pounce on a young lamb, how Michael Powell lays down the rigorous and dangerous life of an island.
(Dialogue) Got it.
Michael Powell began in silent movies and in those days there was an enormous amount of experimentation with film making and here is one example of the kind of thing that he would have learned,
I think, in those silent days.
Instead of doing a very complicated optical, as we would call it today, where you take two pieces of film, shot on different occasions, and then superimpose them over each other,
I'm pretty sure this is one of the sequences that he told me he actually did in the camera.
Imagine how difficult this is: first he filmed Niall MacGinnis, standing in position, almost reacting to the people who are going by him and he probably exposed that at about 50%.
Then the film was rolled back in the camera to...
They would have noted how long that shot was and rolled the film back in the camera and started exposing the sequence of the members of the island long-departed passing past him.
And it's an incredibly beautiful image and extremely difficult to achieve.
You have to have forethought and know how to frame things and how to tell the actors how to look, where their eyeline should be.
Eyeline is very important in movies.
Not something audiences think about, but for a director it's very important where the actor is looking.
And they, of course, are looking at Niall MacGinnis and reacting to him as he is reacting to them in his memories.
The film is really a poem about an island.
Here, a beautiful poetic moment.
At the bottom of this gravestone, the very evocative words:
"Gone over."
Kind of thing you would never see in probably any other cemetery.
Look at this image.
I mean, you have no idea how difficult it is to get a camera into position to take shots like this which evoke the extraordinary physical state of the island, these sharp cliffs just rising out of the sea.
- What's wrong, Andrew?
- The hills of Scotland.
It's a rare thing to see them from Hirta.
(Schoonmaker-Powell) Here you see some sequences shot in the studio: the sequences of Powell and his wife.
You can sort of tell by the soft focus of the background, which is done to fool the eye, when you're trying to match into a shot as dramatic as these cliffs that have been raised up out of the sea by violent earthquakes.
(Dialogue) Ten years ago, you'd have seen all the folk on their way to the kirk.
The men in black, and the women neat and bonny, and young John Eisbister standing by the gate.
(Schoonmaker-Powell) Another incredibly poetic moment here.
Um, beautiful, beautiful shot of a bell ringing.
Maybe it was done the same way the previous shot was, which is, they would have shot the bell at a 50% exposure, then rewound the film, taken the bell down, put up a piece of rope, a frayed piece of rope, signifying that the island is no longer occupied, and shot again, at 50% exposure, getting this beautiful, simple image indicating so much about the death of an island.
As the islanders make their way across the landscape towards the church, which is the focal point of their existence, really, a communal existence, we see Kitty Kirwan, the oldest actress involved in this extraordinary production, who plays the Mansons' grandmother.
She wasn't only the oldest actor in the film, she was also the one who had to wait longest to shoot her few scenes.
At last we arrived at Loban, and in 8 hours made 40 shots, completing the entire
Sunday sequence at the croft, with all the pictorial angles and also every one of Kitty Kirwan's scenes, for which she had been patiently waiting 12 weeks.
12 weeks on the island for one day's work.
She has the north wind to thank for that hectic day, which started with her listening to church bells and finished with her dead on the grass.
Kitty was sent for by cable as soon as we had fixed our schedule.
She was told to hurry.
She caught the night express, grabbed a plane at Aberdeen, raced across Shetland in a car, jumped onto the waiting Vedra and arrived at Rock city in 27 hours from Rock studio.
An all-time record.
Not bad for an 80-year-old.
All her first scenes were with John Laurie.
The Vedra passed the mail boat taking him out with his fractured collarbone.
We broke the news to Kitty.
She settled down for the longest wait an actress has had in history.
(Christie) The kirk, or the church, played a central part in the islanders' life.
And in this form of Presbyterianism you could judge the quality of the service by the length of the sermon.
It's also an occasion, of course, when the social hierarchy of the island is on display, where everyone's dressed up in their Sunday best and where the heads of the two important families, the Grays and the Mansons, meet each other.
There's a little bit of tussling for status.
John Laurie is the laird's representative, as he reminds Finlay Currie, who's the church elder.
There's clearly some competition between these two pillars of the community.
They're both very interesting actors.
Finlay Currie, a much older actor, who had been on stage, had only started to work in film, in fact, in the early 1930s.
He'd made very few films.
He'd appeared in The Good
Companions and Orders Is Orders before he made Edge Of The World.
He would go on to have a very distinguished career in films like Great Expectations.
John Laurie was already a distinguished film actor and had Shakespearean experience and was quite a catch, as far as Powell was concerned, for this very important part.
...for ever and ever. Amen.
(Christie) As we watch this church sequence, it's astonishing, almost impossible, to believe that it was actually shot in a derelict building which had no roof.
(Dialogue) He makes me down to lie.
- (Tuning fork hums)
- La, la... la-la.
(AII sing) The Lord's my shepherd
I'II...
(Christie) The actors were under incredible difficulty.
None of this is conveyed in the church sequence as we see it.
Here's how Michael Powell described it in his book.
(Day-Lewis) The high spot of the southwest location was the church.
There were three physical changes which had to be managed.
These were, firstly, the derelict building in the prologue, with weed-grown yard, buried gravestones, battered roof and forlorn belfry, and a fragment of frayed rope where the bell once hung.
Secondly, the church in the story, trim and neat, a path worn by the years from the gate to the door, the bell clanging as Gerald pulled the rope and the row of dogs sitting peacefully by their rail.
Finally, the interior of the church, sans belfry, sans roof, sans ceiling, and especially, sans warmth.
It is hard to believe that the whole church interior was shot in half a gale.
It was as cold as Christmas.
When making close-ups of Hamish, Finlay and John, we had to place oil stoves all around them to warm their patch of glacial air so that their breath should not show.
Alastair, Bobby Isbister and Sid worked the reflectors, roosting on the rafters in the full force of the wind.
They had to nail their reflectors down.
Themselves, they froze to their seats.
The orange cellophane on the doors and windows crackled like a bush fire as the gusts caught it.
The clouds sailed over at such a pace that we never had more than two minutes of sunlight.
On three days, we had to drop everything, all rush out and make fast tarpaulins before a squall hit us.
The actors were beyond all praise.
They had to be ready, like racehorses, to get off to a quick start, and cram as much action into a short period as possible.
(Dialogue) Some of us, at certain times have been inclined to limit the power of the gospel by supposing that only certain sinners...
...by supposing that only certain sinners obtain the grace of God.
Grand sermon, John.
One hour and 15 minutes. Let them beat that in Edinburgh if they can.
And mind ye, every sentence sound theology.
We'll check the lists and load the boats after the Sabbath's over.
Aye. It's high tide an hour after midnight.
Aye, that's, er, very convenient.
(Christie) Michael Powell found casting the three young principals for the film quite difficult.
It was crucially important that they did have the sort of presence that he needed for this very simple story.
They had to breathe humanity and give it a kind of emotional credibility.
He chose, for the character of Ruth Manson, Belle Chrystall, and for Robbie Manson, her brother, Eric Berry.
And for the figure of Andrew Gray,
Niall MacGinnis.
In the book he published after the film, he explained the kind of reasoning that went into these choices and how, in a sense, one choice influenced the others.
(Day-Lewis) When I saw Belle,
I could have kicked myself for having wasted so much time.
I knew what a grand actress she was and in looks she was ideal.
A fine young face, with deep eyes and a broad forehead, the hair sweeping naturally off it.
A sensitive mouth, a head set cleanly on good shoulders and a strong, supple figure.
Everyone knows how splendid she was in Hindle Wakes and I had also made a test of her for a part at Warner's.
She only failed to get it because of the very qualities of strength and confidence which made her ideal for Ruth.
My mind was made up at once.
Eric Berry was unusual.
He was tall and dark and his eyes were intolerant.
He was not quite tough enough for an islander but he was an actor, that was evident.
It was important that Robbie should have charm and intelligence and Berry had both.
I could not quite make up my mind about him, perhaps because
I had not yet found Andrew.
Niall MacGinnis came from Dublin.
He had shown great promise in a secondary part in Turn Of The Tide.
He had also done good work in several pictures since then.
I went to see his agent,
Bill O'Brien.
He had big plans for MacGinnis, but when he heard a description of the part, he sent him to see me.
I was going to dinner with Frankie and we waited at my flat for him.
He came in at last, looking earnestly about him, his face half scowl, half shy smile.
He looked rather as if he had parked his caravan outside and as soon as he had seen me he would be off into the sunset, with a hey nonny nonny and a wind on the heath.
An actor like this was unusual.
He talked in a liquid Irish voice, and was rather given to long, dark stares and Celtic silences.
He carefully concealed his sense of humour, but could not hide the poetry in his voice and in his movements.
In looks and personality, he was a complete contrast to Berry.
I decided on them both at the same instant.
(Dialogue) Then you'll have it.
- You're leaving the island?
- Aye.
- Short-handed as we are?
- Aye.
- Does anybody know?
- Only you two.
- When are you going to tell Peter?
- Tomorrow.
- The boat parliament?
- Aye.
Ah, Robbie, man, you've gone over to the other side.
Before I went away,
I would have said the same as you.
But the world's changed, it's bigger, it's easier to get at.
Before, we were no worse off than anyone else.
Now we're living in an old world.
I've got a turn for machinery,
I can do things with it.
Why should I give it up?
What can Polly and I hope for if I drag her back here?
Ah, Robbie, you're too clever for me.
You go your way and I'll go mine.
- Aye, but can't you see...
- That's final.
If you want to run away because the work's too hard, or your fancy...
Leave her out of it!
- I'd be glad to.
- I'm as good a man as you are.
(Christie) One idea that Powell wanted to develop in the film was the balance in the islanders' lives between the hard grind of survival and an almost mystical sense of oneness with nature.
This is a very remote community, it's steeped in tradition and included in the traditions is a belief that, for instance, being able to see the hills of Scotland is a sign of ill omen.
Something dangerous, alarming, threatening is going to happen.
So it's warning us and it's setting a different tone in the film.
We know that this life that we've been introduced to will have a shadow cast over it.
Meanwhile, there's an urgent matter to discuss.
And again, another aspect of the traditional life of the island, which Powell had picked up from his research, was the idea of the boat parliament, where all the men of the island get together, close to the scene of their primary activity, fishing, and they have a parliament, a basic... council, where they sit and discuss the most important issues.
And here the most important issue is whether to continue on the island or to accept that their traditional way of life will have to end and that they have to seek evacuation.
(Dialogue) Year by year, the population's shrinking.
The background to this debate and the dilemma facing the islanders was the impact of new technology on their lives.
The steam trawlers that we see later were already scarring the northern seas, with their otter boards dragging over the sea bed and damaging the next spawn of fish.
By contrast, the islanders' traditional rowing boats had been replaced by small power-driven boats that practised drifter fishing, using fine nets kept up by air-filled floats to catch herring.
According to the regulations, trawlers were supposed to observe a three-mile limit around the islands.
But, inevitably, they often didn't.
Already, in the 1930s, the traditional livelihood of the island fishermen was under threat.
Catches were low and unpredictable and the trawler fleets took a lot of the blame.
Powell argued in his book that the issue wasn't really so black and white.
He noted that the trawlermen performed many acts of kindness for the islanders.
But in the end they were driven by the profit motive.
This would inevitably destroy the fragile island economy.
He sums it up in the book like this:
"The conquest of nature by civilisation is a fine theme and always printed in big capitals, but what good is civilisation, if it drives a strong, hardy, independent people back from the outposts to live in towns?"
(Dialogue)... you spoke for half the island when you're not two days back from the very boats that have ruined us!
Three months' work and £63 to show for it.
Shillings is what I'd be showing if I'd stayed on Hirta.
- Och, you're no son o' mine.
- Don't take it so hard, Peter, man.
The boy's just said what had to be said.
Men we must have, and where are we going to get them?
Oh, this tale o' Robbie's has been in my mind for a long while.
Now, if we was to petition the Government, there's little doubt we'd get free transportation...
(Christie) The decision about the future of the island is going to be made not by a vote, in this parliament, but by a contest: the prowess of two rival champions, the two sons of the two families, who take opposing views.
Robbie and Andrew will race, following tradition, to the top of the cliff and whoever wins, that will be the community's decision.
- I can see no objection.
- Down to the boats!
Come on, then!
(Christie) Making a film like this, on an incredibly remote island, was very, very difficult.
There was no possibility of flying anything in.
It was difficult even to get supplies and personnel in by boat, because Foula had a very difficult harbour.
So everything that they needed had to be brought and anything that had to be brought in later or any emergency that occurred on the island necessitated a difficult and quite dangerous trip to Lerwick.
This was film making absolutely on the edge.
(Dialogue) I'll lose you both!
Of course, for film makers, the fact that you can't see your dailies is terrifying.
Today we wouldn't even consider it.
You can electronically send images to the top of Everest probably today.
My assistants in the editing room and I always joke about the message that Michael Powell received from the studio in London after the dailies had been... the first dailies had been developed:
"Picture invisible, sound inaudible.
Is this intentional?"
(Laughs) And we just love that because it just captures the absolutely terrifying feeling it must've been to get that message.
Michael always told that story with great humour because he saw the humour in it, as always.
This film, for Michael Powell, was as if it was his first-born.
He had a passionate love for it which he never lost until the end of his days.
In fact, he was so moved, about
60 years after this film was made, maybe 55, when he showed it at the Santa Fe film festival and got a standing ovation, it meant so much to him, partly because he'd been disappointed in how the film was first received.
He stayed in touch with the islanders.
He fell in love with all the islanders, of course, and he stayed in touch with them for the rest of his life.
They exchanged letters,
Christmas cards, phone calls and he made sure that the film was shown to the islanders who had participated in it.
Have you chosen your route yet?
Aye. Up the east side, then straight along, up by the channel.
The old way we went egg hunting.
Remember there's no rope this time.
I'm no likely to forget.
I'm for the south face, then over the Devil's Elbow.
- Longer, but I'll make better time.
- You'll have to.
- It's a grand treat for the folk.
- Are you ready?
When you get to the burn...
(Christie) The challenge in this sequence is to convey more than just a race or a climb.
It has to be something elemental.
It's very interesting how important the elements are in it.
We're very, very conscious of rock, sea, water, light.
Er, it becomes a truly elemental sequence.
Looking at this sequence of the cliff climb, this is where the film joins another, quite important, current in '30s film making.
It started in Germany at the end of the '20s, the mountain films, which Leni Reifenstahl made her name in.
And Emeric Pressburger, who still had not met Michael Powell, they'd be introduced very shortly afterwards, was working, just about this time, on a film called The Challenge, about the first ascent of the Matterhorn.
The mountain film, in various forms, was becoming quite important and this is one of the most startling, picturesque and dramatic contributions to the '30s mountain film.
It's even more so when we realise that Niall MacGinnis and Eric Berry had to do their own climbing.
And even if the close-ups were done under, perhaps, reasonably controlled conditions, a shot like this is truly breathtaking.
Getting the shots of the anxious watchers in the boats was very difficult indeed: they weren't shot at the same time.
As the days, weeks, went by,
Powell was getting increasingly worried about finding the right conditions to shoot the men in the boats, which was essential for the construction of this scene.
It wasn't until they'd left Foula and returned to Lerwick that he managed in one epic day to shoot almost all these images, knowing that they would intercut and produce this remarkable sequence.
He tells in his book just how difficult and how dangerous the final section of Eric Berry's climb was.
This really was putting an actor at risk.
(Day-Lewis) Eric had to climb up through the waterfall.
I decided this was not spectacular enough.
Sid organised a dam crew and at the word "Camera!" they let a ton or two of water over the top.
We all got wet, but the scene undoubtedly had more punch, especially when small boulders came over into Eric's open mouth.
The rest of the climb was shot on various locations between Hoevdi and the Sneck.
The method was simpler than it looks.
On bad days,
I scrambled around and found nasty spots that were effective on the screen.
Eventually we all arrived there,
I demonstrated the climb,
Niall said to himself
"Where he can go, I can."
Eric, fortunately, was short-sighted and I do not believe to this day that he knows half of what he did.
The only thing that put him off was the surf below him.
To his eyes, without glasses, it was a dizzy white gulf, full of noises, far below.
He was not far wrong, either.
(Christie) This sequence of grinding is one of those moments in the film where the ethnographic aspect of it, showing the islanders' lives and what they do, also has a symbolic force, because we do get a strong sense, watching this great stone turning, of, if you like, the turning of life in the island after the tragic death of Robbie.
The image of wheat being ground here is a very strong theme in Michael Powell's life.
In his autobiography, he does a paean of praise to the mills that he saw in his childhood in Kent.
I've always felt that, uh... one of the reasons he's such a wonderful director, understands people so deeply, is because he was lucky enough to be brought up on a farm, where he experienced all levels of humanity, and always had an extremely strong connection to the earth.
(Dialogue) James and Andrew of Burns,
I bid you to the funeral of Robbie Manson, tomorrow, at 12.
We will come.
Jessie and Jean of Grisengarth.
I bid you to prepare for the funeral of Robbie Manson, tomorrow, at 12.
(Christie) The repetition of this solemn phrase has an interesting ritual quality.
It reminds us, in a strange way, of something Biblical, where a character goes from point to point, repeating the same phrase.
Again, it reminds us of the elemental nature of the islanders' lives, the fact that they're all bound together in sickness, health and death.
This sequence is really so stunning, partially because a simple fact of life on an island, which is there were no telephones, and probably mail was only delivered maybe to the harbour, and everyone went down to meet the mail boat, so therefore you had to go yourself and announce it.
And out of that comes this terribly moving moment of Peter Manson and his daughter verbally announcing the day and time of his funeral.
Hovan, hovan, hovan eerie
Scorsese and I have always loved this funeral sequence, the editing of some very beautiful shots and then the combination, obviously, of the music and the images is so important.
The beautiful idea that the coffin is carried on oars which, for those of us who are not islanders, is stunning.
And then this moment when the oars are raised just sends chills through you.
Again, beautiful up-angle across the waving vegetation, to be used again after another strong shot of the boots marching on the... on the wooden causeway.
The up-angle underneath the coffin revealing Peter Manson, so movingly.
Again, repetition of the same shot here, probably because the editor felt it would be stronger to have that and then cut to this reverse shot of the men carrying the coffin.
(Christie) There is a real sense of the physicality of standing in the driving rain at a funeral.
In that sense it looks forward to the importance of footage like this in Italian neorealism, in the 1940s.
That's exactly the kind of feel of working men having to stand in the rain that we get very strongly from the Italian films of the late '40s.
Here we have it, a very rare and interesting example, in British cinema, as early as 1937.
(Day-Lewis) As the last, sad shot of the funeral fades away, the audience is suddenly transported to a different world.
The sun gleams on the sea, there are distant cries and the bleat of sheep and rapid movements of tiny figures.
It is the perfect contrast.
Hardly have the audience seen enough of the sheep-run sequence, but enough to see that every soul on the island is busily engaged, when they are switched to the meeting of the two lovers, a tranquil, glowing scene among running waters and yellow iris.
Another contrast, but a part of the run.
The sheep run has now a definite purpose.
It changes the tempo at the proper moment.
It creates unique atmosphere.
It provides a shield for the meeting of the lovers, by its contrast of busy action with complete calm.
It is no longer only pictorial and instructive, it is dramatic, and a necessary part of the film.
This was done by cutting the two episodes together.
I brought back from Foula two good but sharply different sequences, one dramatic, the other documentary.
A casual observer, an unskilled technician, a bad cutter, would have recommended cutting the run to a minimum or losing it altogether.
"No time for a lot of sheep, they've seen sheep before."
A cutter of genius, like Derek Twist, conceives the idea of combining the two sequences.
(Dialogue) A hard man, you mean.
Oh, no worse than you all are.
You said yourself he won't hear my name spoken since Robbie died.
- You canna blame him for that.
- No?
Will I speak to him?
He'll never let us marry... now.
One of the delightful details in Powell's book about the making of the film is the fact that many of the exterior sequences were shot to the accompaniment of a wind-up gramophone, which Powell carried around with him, usually playing Smetana's Moldau, and he asks us to imagine that, just out of shot, is this figure prancing around, carrying a battered gramophone, with an almost worn-out record.
It's one of those little details that gives you a different view of what you're seeing on the screen.
Powell doesn't suggest this would've been a better accompaniment than the wonderful music that Bill Williamson put together at very short notice and very economically for him.
(Dialogue) Oh, Ruth, I'm sorry.
(Christie) A blast of smoke from the chimney of the ship marks, perhaps ironically, the end of the lovemaking sequence between Andrew and Ruth but it also introduces the next episode, which is the visit of the laird to inspect his property.
Again we're reminded, er, very strongly that these are tough economic facts of life.
The islands survive only if they're profitable.
The islanders have to prove that they're viable.
And they have to prove to the owners of the islands...
We are in a... not exactly feudal situation, but something very far removed from the experience of most modern city dwellers.
And it was the non-viability of St Kilda which had led to its evacuation, back in 1930.
This was a continuing story and Powell found, as he travelled round Scotland and met historians and geographers, that there was a lot of enthusiasm for making a film about this potential tragedy facing all of Scotland's islands.
So this is an important sequence and it meant a lot to Powell to be able to show the economic reality of islanders' lives.
He wasn't just a romantic, he was somebody who understood the difficulty of sustaining these small, remote communities.
And so the dialogue between Andrew and the laird about what the options are for him and Ruth and for the islanders in general is an important strand of the film.
It also, I suppose, reminds us of the economic background to the making of the film itself, because film making in Britain was something of a cottage industry at this time.
The Quota Act of 1929 had made it possible for many small film-production companies to come into existence, guaranteed some market for the films that they made very cheaply.
Michael Powell had cut his teeth making these so-called
"quota quickies", films made for as little as £5,000 designed to fill the lower part of a double bill.
Many of those companies that came into existence disappeared almost as quickly.
In 1936, there was a big downturn in the British film industry, and there were lay-offs and closures right across the whole industry.
It was in that climate that Joe Rock, an American who'd come to England, and who was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy himself, decided to back Powell's vision of a film about the island.
It was a brave thing to do.
He was a man, Powell said, with a passion for adventure location films and if he hadn't had that passion they'd never have got started.
Ironically, by the time the film was completed,
Joe Rock's company was actually in bankruptcy.
But the film had been made and did eventually get released.
(Dialogue) James...?
Aye, it's all right, it's all there.
Here, mind that box. They're eggs.
(Schoonmaker-Powell) The point of view always very strong here, the camera always placed looking down into the boat, the way someone would if they were about to leave and on the dock, or the strong angle up from the boat, the point of view of the person who's leaving.
Again, it would be much easier not to shoot with the camera in the boat.
You can imagine how difficult that is.
The amount of space is very little, but a director who really knows what he's doing will decide to do that, no matter what the difficulty.
The next sequence in the film, of Ruth standing on the cliff side, mourning the loss of Andrew, is one of the most amazing sequences in the film.
Scorsese and I, when we first saw the restored version, and discovered this beautiful piece of film making, were just staggered.
I don't know whether Michael shot this sequence in the camera.
I doubt it.
I think, probably, he had this very dramatic up-angle of Ruth and a beautiful shot that pans from Ruth down to the ocean, and this beautiful, beautiful superimposition which gives you the feeling of her desperation and thoughts of suicide.
(Christie) The movement of the film is between segments of drama and segments that show us the life of the islanders and this is another of those... everyday life on Foula.
We're seeing the harvesting.
There's the turning of the seasons because it has underlying seasonal structure.
And seasons are very important on the island, not only the brief growing season, but then, of course, the onset of the winter and the storms and the heavy seas, which make communication impossible.
So these two dimensions are woven together.
This is the peat cutting, which is another feature of spring.
Although Powell was often quite dismissive of documentary film making, this wasn't because he undervalued the documentary aspect of film.
Not at all.
I think what he objected to was the way documentary was being put on a pedestal, especially in Britain in the 1930s.
It was as if the rest of film making didn't matter, it was only commercial, only storytelling.
The documentaries of John Grierson and the young film makers around him were being put forward as
Britain's only truly creative cinema.
Obviously, that would've been red rag to a bull as far as Powell was concerned.
And in fact, I think we can see
Edge Of The World as belonging to a real movement that was sweeping the world.
It was a movement to document the lives of communities that were disintegrating and that would no longer exist.
You can see it happening in France, in Holland, where
Joris Yvens was working, and Yvens then went to America and made films about rural America.
And Pare Lorentz made two extraordinary films just around this time, in America,
The Plough That Broke The Plains and The River, both films inspired by Roosevelt's New Deal and the Farm Security Administration.
Films that tried to show the kind of forces of nature that people were up against who lived in the country and by the banks of the great rivers.
Edge Of The World clearly belongs to that great desire of the '30s to use cinema to show, predominantly, city dwellers the kind of, erm, struggles that those who lived by the sea or on the land faced.
As the seasons turn,
Ruth is now desperate to make contact with Andrew, because their coming together has resulted in a pregnancy.
And she knows that she's going to give birth to Andrew's child but she has no way of reaching him, except through this extraordinary primitive and yet poetic means, the letter boat.
It could almost come out of a film set in the South Seas.
It's an invention, as far as we know, on Powell's part.
It isn't necessarily how any of the islanders did communicate.
But it fulfils a poetic function, because it's sending a small boat out into the storm-tossed ocean, with only the possibility that it might reach Andrew.
It's the melodramatic function of the film, its melodramatic dimension: the woman waiting by the sea for news of the father of her child.
(Schoonmaker-Powell) Working on a film like this creates lifelong bonds and Michael Powell remained very close to some of the crew who worked on this film.
All of the crew, really, who kept reappearing in his life, working on his films for many years to come.
One of the difficulties of shooting on the island was that medical emergencies were rather scary.
And John Seabourne, who was very important to Michael during the shoot, had to be taken off the island.
But it was a great loss to Michael.
He described John Seabourne at this time as a storyteller, right-hand, cutter, assistant, actor and dance director.
I guess that might be referring to the little dance sequence for the celebration of the birth of the baby.
John Seabourne was supposed to edit the film, but because of his illness was unable to and Derek Twist then took over.
(Dialogue) Is this true?
Yes.
Andrew Gray's child?
Yes. And you can't take that from me.
Poor lassie.
(Schoonmaker-Powell) Beautiful piece of acting here by John Laurie, changing from the stern, stern father into a sympathetic human being.
I've always loved this sequence.
A very long pan from the sea over the blowing vegetation, to reveal the baby.
Beautiful way to segue into the birth of the child.
The use of light and the faces of the islanders in this sequence are beautifully done.
Again the humour.
Always in Michael Powell films, the unexpected humour.
The women all knitting away for the only child who's been born on the island probably in years!
Always trying to find moments when the wind is blowing people's hair, or the sun is highlighting their faces in a very evocative way.
And then again, the blowing of the smoke from the wind, the powerful mountain behind and the music, again the music.
...brought you a dream, my dear
List' to the curlew...
(Christie) This sequence is among the most successful in terms of lighting.
It's a point where the balance between natural light and, I imagine, the use of reflectors achieves a very sophisticated, very ethereal quality.
It's an evening light, and it's beautifully caught, that, knowing how difficult the making of the film was, is quite miraculous.
This quality of light is often known by cameramen as the magic hour.
It involves shooting just at that point where the lengthening shadows don't interfere with getting a decent image.
Jack Cardiff, the great cameraman who later worked with Powell and Pressburger, titled his autobiography
Magic Hour and talks about it there.
Powell would often seek these qualities of lighting and in his later Scottish film
I Know Where I'm Going there are also some magical uses of the gloaming, the twilight effect.
This is the point where the whole community comes together.
The wounds between the families seem to be healed by the arrival of the child.
At last, we see the community dancing, singing, playing together, and the camera captures this sense of community, because it moves.
A few times during the shooting, they were able to lay down track in order to do a classic tracking shot, as one would see probably more of if they had been in a less inhospitable environment.
And you'll see that here, as Finlay Currie moves among the dancers.
Here's the tracking shot.
Difficult because of the roughness of the land, but they must have figured out a way to smooth out the track.
But you see very little of that in this film because of the difficulties of the shooting.
(Christie) There's also a real sense of background here, too.
Again, something unusual, we have... dramatic scene in the foreground and, behind it, the whole sense of different groups and pairings.
It's a shot full of depth and infused with a sense of community.
In Lerwick... this is the outside world, this is really the first time we've been off the island.
There's something quite evocative about it to our eyes, because it looks almost picturesque.
But I think what it's meant to stand for, in this context, is something industrial.
It's alien, it's very different, the opposite of Foula.
These great barrels, all piled up, speak of a busy, bustling port.
Lerwick was very important for the production of the film.
It was the nearest base where they could go and watch rushes in a cinema.
It was the only thing that enabled the production to keep going.
On the 26th October, a date which Michael Powell remembers vividly, there was sunshine nowhere in the entire United Kingdom, except in Lerwick.
That sunshine enabled them to do a mighty day's shooting and salvaged the film, in terms of getting all the narrative shots they needed.
One of them'll be picked up.
Aye, if they're not blown too far south.
Nah. This wind'll take them right among the fishing fleet.
(Christie) Lerwick is the base for the steam-driven fishing boats which are industrialising fishing.
And of course this is one of the big issues of this period.
John Grierson made a film called Drifters, which dealt with the new challenges to traditional fishing methods, back in 1929.
And fishing and its industrialisation was very much on the agenda right through the '30s.
So when we see Andrew signing up with the skipper and we see that black trail of smoke behind, this is something which would've been quite evocative for most of the film's original audience.
It's even more evocative for us today, as we face the end of fishing from the Scottish islands.
It's quite remarkable to see the density of trawlers moored in Lerwick, back in 1936.
Bill Paton, a solid Shetlander, whom Michael Powell discovered on this film, and who would then become
Michael's right-hand during the rest of his filming career was born and raised in this town.
(Dialogue) He was.
I'm glad to meet one of his folks, so to speak.
I'm glad I met you, Skipper.
- I've a letter for you.
- You have?
Aye. One of these little mail boats.
I picked him up last Wednesday off Sunborough Head.
- Where is it?
- Back at the "damn trawler".
It's thanks to mechanised fishing that Andrew will be able to respond to the message, because while the primitive means of sending mail in a tiny boat is pure chance, it's only with an engine behind him that Andrew will be able to get to Foula in time to hopefully save his and Ruth's child.
So we see the ship being stoked.
This is really like an image from one of those
Grierson documentaries of the 1930s.
We could almost be in a film like Coal Face, or one of the other, one of the many fishing films made at this time.
It's interesting how Powell manages to drop into a documentary idiom and then move out of it when the drama of the film needs to be reasserted.
When we see in these images the beginnings of the great storm which forms the second climax of the film...
They're very picturesque, they're beautiful.
This is one of the great nature sequences, really as fine as anything in a French or a Russian film, in its rhythmic use of different textures, different kinds of movement, as the wind begins to rise.
In fact, what the film makers were going through was much more terrifying and even more elemental because a real storm blew up, they were cut off for some weeks on Foula.
The wind rose and for ten days it blew.
(Day-Lewis) The wind shifted slowly but steadily into the south, and as steadily started to blow with increasing force, until, by the 10th of October, the Geo, the shells of Hellabrick, the Ness and the cliffs themselves had vanished into the grey sound and fury of a full gale from the southwest.
It blew until the mess hut shook and heaved beneath our feet.
We expected to see it torn to pieces.
It blew the water out of Mill Loch and up into the air.
A whirling water spout,
300 feet high.
It blew the camera off its legs, with Skeets on top and Carl underneath.
It blew until at night sleep was impossible, while every hut tugged and strained at its mooring ropes, the roofs vibrating like drums, steel guys humming and twanging, and each gust tearing at the boards beside our heads.
The yacht in the Voe heeled over until her keel showed through the flurry.
Alastair got to her with a rescue party, who made fast a cable with a braking strain of a ton and a half round her mast.
It snapped in two minutes.
The wireless mast was blown down, the stone dyke behind the schoolhouse was blown over.
Frankie, venturing out with me to see Mill Loch water spout, stepped beyond the house and was picked up by a flann, hurled 40 feet and rolled head over heels down the hill.
I had to go after her on my hands and knees and crawl back to safety with her bumping and laughing behind me.
By the fourth day, there were no fresh vegetables.
By the fifth day, no fresh meat except caddie mutton, which means one joint per person to make a square meal.
By the sixth day, no cigarettes left but Woodbines.
On the seventh, not even Woodbines.
On the eighth, we had to beg from the island's winter store of peat.
On the ninth, a famine of all that makes life worth living stared us in the face.
On the tenth, we began to consider seriously a plan of rationing, and Ernie, discovering a packet of 20 Players in his oilskin, was nearly lynched.
The concert, long planned by Finlay, to show the islanders what they missed at Walls had to be cancelled.
It was impossible to hear anybody speak in the mess hut.
The racket was appalling.
Tongues of flame, three feet long, shooting out of the stove, limited our space.
It was a bitter blow.
Maud was to have sung You Are
My Honeysuckle, I Am The Bee, and Syd, by request, Trees.
On the 11th day, the gale began to drop.
Our spirits rose accordingly.
We sallied out with Belle and the pony.
We had to keep in the brae or in the lee of a croft: the wind was still strong enough to hold a small reflector high on the side of a wall without any need of hands.
And the Hoevdi was still breaking.
But there was likely to be a lull before the next gale.
We no longer had to wonder how
25 people over the normal population were possibly to be fed for another week.
Or perhaps six weeks.
(Christie) As the real storm raged and made the film makers feel that they might never see the mainland again, and they heroically continued to try to film during it, they were getting, unbeknownst to them, fantastic advance publicity for the film.
The Daily Mail ran a headline:
Film Party Marooned
On Storm-swept Island;
Wireless SOS For Supplies.
As Michael Powell suggests in the book, there was a hideous photograph of Belle Chrystall, looking coy and blonde, to illustrate that sequence.
Powell had originally intended to shoot this dramatic scene of the doctor operating on the sick baby in the cabin of the film's supply ship, the Vedra, as part of his philosophy of making the whole film on location.
But with all the pressure to complete the exteriors and bad weather closing in, there was no time.
Indeed, we might wonder how authentic the real thing would have looked if he'd carried through the original plan.
In the end, a cabin set was built in the London studio.
(Dialogue) This way, Doctor.
(Christie) The larger point being made in this scene is that in a medical emergency, as in this case of diphtheria, the big trawlers could make a vital difference.
So it's really part of showing us that the issue isn't simply a choice between traditional ways and new-fangled ways which are all bad.
In fact, the story really turns on the trawler coming to the rescue.
(Dialogue) I've got you both safe now, and you're not going back.
(Christie) The baby's life is saved but the island's life is not.
And at this point the film rejoins the real-life story which first inspired Michael Powell: the evacuation of St Kilda.
This is the end of the island community.
From this point onwards, they're going to become mainlanders.
It's a very poignant moment, the moment which originally inspired
Powell to think of making this film.
And he shoots it with a kind of statuesque nobility which is as powerful as anything in the great European cinemas of the previous decade.
We think of Russian cinema,
French cinema in the late '20s, which had dealt with some of these themes.
Here, at last, British cinema has its own epic of the land.
In the superimposition sequence, they had to freeze the shot of John Laurie in order to get enough footage so that they could put the extended montage of the images of the island over it.
It's kind of the thing probably only a film maker would notice, but again, Michael Powell sells it, he dares you to even notice it, actually.
(Christie) What we see during the evacuation scene is in fact the lifeline that made the filming possible: an old steamer called the Vedra, which was captained by Vernon Sewell, one of the staunch team that Powell assembled around him, all as committed as he was to making this adventure result in a film.
Vernon Sewell had knocked around doing many jobs in the film industry and he was also quite a sailor.
He went on to make a film which Powell produced, now working with Pressburger: The Silver Fleet.
Then he had a later career directing some remarkable Gothic horror movies with titles like
The Blood Beast Terror and Curse Of The Crimson Altar.
As Powell makes clear in his book, without Sewell's commitment and the sense of improvisation and fun, just pulling together as a team, this film would never have been made, given the odds stacked against it.
What we see here, in the evacuation scenes, are some of the logistical problems that the film's makers faced when they were actually shooting.
(Dialogue) James, man,
I'm away up the Kame.
One of they daft collectors offered me five pounds for a guillemot's egg.
I know just where it is.
(Christie) As we move into the final sequence, we're moving back into melodrama, because the figure of Peter Manson, who has lost his son, is not a figure who is going to move into the future.
He belongs too much to the island.
He opposed his son's wish to leave and now he's going to make a gesture which will lead to his own death.
He claims that he's going to go and find an egg because one of the economic features of island life was that islanders were often commissioned to find rare eggs for egg collectors and he thinks he should make some money before he leaves.
But the larger movement of the film, the sense of its tragic conclusion, means that he's going to his death as we see him head up this Ionely road.
It's an astonishing shot: as this tiny figure disappears, his dog breaks free, and races after him.
Michael Powell knew, as he finished his film, that there was no guarantee that the film would achieve any kind of immortality, although it had meant so much to him and the team who made it.
And he wrote at the end of his book, a book written to ensure that the film reached a wider public, about an old cook in their family, who had the perfect answer to those who wanted the last word.
(Day-Lewis) We once had an old cook, a great hand at elaborate pastries.
I watched her in the kitchen putting the final touches to a huge pie.
Vine leaves, scrolls and curly bits of pastry, all brushed over with a feather dipped in yolk of egg.
A final flourish and "There, Master Michael."
"A pie fit for a king," she said.
Then, as she slid it into a hot oven, the disillusionment of a true artist swept over her and I heard her mutter darkly
"And then you eats it, and it's all done."
If her audience praised her work, she beamed.
If they were indifferent, she would say scornfully
"Not a bit of good cooking for some folks."
She is still making pies and I am still making films, but for a long time, none can be so near my heart as The Edge Of The World.
I wish I were as sure of its perfection as the old cook was of her pies.
At any rate, like her,
I can always have the last word.
These days, when viewers are used to computer-generated images of astonishing locations and beings interacting with those locations, in a way you could never actually shoot, it's hard to remember how difficult every shot taken on this island was.
Here you see over and over and over again the camera placed in the most difficult places.
And if you weren't a director with such determination and, uh, passion, you might have tried to shoot things a different way.
One reason this film meant so much to Michael Powell is because it was a gamble he took on doing what he really had always wanted to be in films for, which is to make a film that came from his heart: what we would call an "art film" today!
I don't think he would like that term.
He had been trapped for so long, making quota quickies in the British film industry for seven long years, films that he really did not care for, because they were remakes of American films, some of them.
Some have very interesting things in them, he cut his teeth on them, but he always was reserved in his judgement about them.
I think that was because he didn't feel that they were ideas that he had originated, subjects that were close to his heart.
And that is why this film was his great breakthrough.
An enormous gamble, and it paid off, because Alexander Korda saw the film and, based on the remarkable nature of the filming in extreme conditions, hired Michael Powell and kept him from going to America.
(Dialogue) Oh, Peter!
(Christie) The powerful elemental images carry the melodrama.
Peter has to die to mark the island's death.
And what we see is remarkably close to how Powell originally conceived the scene in his script.
(Day-Lewis) With his stave and old rope, he goes on up the cliffs and the only eye to see him go is his dog's, who follows far behind.
Up past his old croft he strides, up past the last gate, up onto the moor and the great cliffs.
With his stave and his rope, he goes over.
His rope is frayed.
He does not seem to see it.
Down and down he goes, while his dog peers after him and whines anxiously.
He finds the rare egg, but he never brings it back to the upper air.
James, hunting in the mist, calls his friend's name, the dog barks and barks.
A dull rumble from the cliffs and a broken end of rope are the last of Peter Manson.
- Peter!
- (Echoes) Peter!
- Peter Manson!
- (Echoes) Peter Manson!
Sing in hope, let's find the breeze
Ho-ro, chasing the breeze

Gentlemen, the war is over at last.
The men are coming back.
The living are coming back.
We shall have hundreds of thousands of disbanded soldiers.
Idle men.
Men badly in need of work, Mr. President.
Gentlemen, we have the country to save fiirst.
But these men have saved their country.
Now the country must save them.
Their return home in such great numbers might paralyze industry... by furnishing suddenly a greater supply oflabor than for which there could be a demand.
Mr. President.
Mr. Colfax.
I have read an editorial in the Terra Haute Express... written by Mr.John Soule, in which he says, ''Go west, young man.''
Where there is room for all.
Gentlemen, our land stretches from an Eastern sea to a Western sea.
Surely, in that vast territory, there is a place for men to live and work and be happy.
Right,
Mr. President.
True, Mr. President.
I hope to attract our disbanded soldiers to the hidden wealth of our mountain ranges... and to the wealth that lies in the soil itself.
And to the grasslands of the Great Plains.
The fields of Illinois, the broken sod of Kansas, the long furrows of the West.
Yes, Mr. President, but if only the frontier could be made safe for the plow.
It must be made safe.
But during the war hostile Indians massacred our settlers there.
- Mr. Lincoln?
- Yes, Mary?
We'll be late for the theater.
Gentlemen, I promised to take Mrs. Lincoln to Ford's Theater tonight.
We will continue this tomorrow... for the frontier must be made safe.
Good night, Mr. President.
Good night.
Good night, Mr. President.
I have never seen him looking so well.
But the war is over, and we have on our hands order after order... canceled by the government.
Hundreds of thousands of rifles unsold.
Once we were the saviors of our country.
Now we're outcasts.
Our money invested in an unsalable product.
But a good product, gentlemen.
A new repeating rifle would have made short work of the war... had it been introduced earlier.
But now the subject of guns is an unpopular topic... to those who needed them so badly a short while ago.
We'll have to look to Providence for a market.
Providence? Where?
I've been told that the Indians hunt with bow and arrow.
Still, they obtain furs, valuable buffalo hides, otter, fox and beaver.
With our new repeating rifle--
Dearie me.
Why shouldn't we be frank?
I have every reason to believe the Indians will pay $1 00 for each rifle.
A hundred dollars?
In furs. And a dollar a piece for every cartridge.
But we can't sell rifles to the Indians!
I think we can... to peaceable Indians.
But how--
For hunting.
They furnish us with furs.
We supply them with rifles.
Really quite simple.
Won't they use those guns against white men?
We'll get the Indians to promise not to do so.
I'm against this!
But why?
It's bound to make trouble on the frontier.
President Lincoln says--
We have a perfect right to do it.
Sheer nonsense.!
The army would stop us.
They control trade with the Indians.
They did, my friend.
But Indian affairs have been taken out of the hands of the army... and given to a civilian authority.
A civilian authority?
Yep, in which we are to have a certain participation.
Do I make myself clear?
Perfectly.
But who sells the rifles?
Ask Mr. Lattimer to come in.
Perhaps not the most personable gentleman... but certainly the man for our needs.
Gentlemen, this is
Mr.John Lattimer,
How do you do? who will distribute our rifles through St. Louis... to Hays City and all the Great Plains.
Right, Mr. Lattimer?
I said I'd do it.
Van Ellyn, if ever
Mr. Lincoln finds out--
It's a legitimate business.
The Ford Theater.!
Open that window!
Lincoln shot at Ford's Theater.!
The president is dying.!
Hear that?
Someone has shot the president.
They say he's dying.
Only yesterday afternoon
I was talking to him at the Capitol.
Maybe it isn't true.
We must learn the facts.
A terrible thing,
Mr. Lattimer.
Yes, a national calamity.
You will leave at once for St. Louis.
Dearie me.
Terrible thing.
Oh, there he is.
- Excuse me, soldier!
- Bull's-eye!
I didn't see ya.
That's all right, son.
Come here and let me see your gun.
You haven't got any notches on it.
What'd I kill?
Don't you see that great big buffalo laying there kickin'?
Yeah. He's a big one, ain't he?
Give me your knife, and we'll skin 'im.
You better not.
You might find out he's been eating potatoes.
Gee, whillikens.
I'll bet you could kill a buffalo with this knife.
You can't kill a buffalo with a knife.
Aw. I'll bet
Buffalo Bill could.
You know what
I saw him do once?
What?
First give me back my Arkansas toothpick.
You give me back my gun.
I saw Buffalo Bill shoot at a whole herd of them once.
At first I thought he'd missed.
Then two of them started coughing and fell down dead.
He'd killed 'em both and raised a big cloud of dust a mile and a half the other side of them.
And that isn't all.
That little cloud of dust he raised grew into a whirlwind, turned itself into a cyclone and wiped out one-fourth ofTexas... before they could stop it.
Jimminies!
That's the kind of shootin' I aim to do.
That whistle's just a half a minute wrong.
Listen.
Don't that beat all.
Cute, isn't it?
Say, you're dressed like a scout there.
So's your sister.
That's not my sister.
That's CalamityJane.
Was she your best girl?
Son, one of these days you're gonna grow up, and you ought to know about women.
You see, the thing is this, women are, uh--
Well, they're, um--
Well, son--
I can tell you what an Indian will do to ya, but you never know what a woman will do.
Why?
Well--
Let's go down and take a look at that fire engine.
If you don't like her, what do you carry her picture around for?
It's the only good picture of me I ever had taken.
I can't cut her off without cutting off my chin.
John Lattimer, 1 7.
I see a good mark.
John Lattimer, 1 8.
Wait. I see an easy mark.
Where?
John Lattimer, 1 9.
Oh, yes.
Hello, Virginia!
I'll be around shortly.
We hate to say good-bye.
When you comin' back?
When you come and see me.
I want you to take Hannibal.
He sings.
Oh, Will, look.
I see a good fighting man who's been fool enough to get himself married.
Ow!
What's the matter?
Oh, my hats!
Jiggers! Let's duck.
Here. Hold on, bub.
Come back here.
Hey, who do you think you're--
Bill! You long-legged, fugacious old gallinipper!
What are you doin' here?
Well, I, uh--
Here's somebody who wants an introduction to you.
Boy, you wouldn't know him in these tinhorn garments, but this is the best scout west of the Mississippi.
Shake hands with Buffalo Bill.
Buffalo Bill!
Howdy, youngster.
Son, this fellow taught me all
I ever knew about scoutin'.
Ah!
You mustered out yet,
Bill?
Yesterday.
Ya ain't losin' much time gettin' up the Big Muddy.
He seems to have met a friend.
Yes, a rather strange friend.
How long have you been out?
Oh, about three months.
I see she hasn't cut your hair... yet.
I don't know what you mean, Bill.
You know what happened to Samson when Delilah opened her barbershop.
Has she tamed you yet?
That ain't fair.
She's different.
You're different.
Bill, she's the finest little gal--
I know, I know.
You gotta meet her.
No, Bill.
Women and me don't agree.
All that's goin; get aboard.!
Come on! You'll like her.
All that's goin', get aboard!
Don't be nervous.
He'll be here.
Come, Will!
Hurry.!
All right, Lou.
I want you to meet the best friend--
We haven't time.
We must get on the boat.
All that's goin; get aboard.!
Bye, Buffalo Bill!
Bye!
Bye, Louisa.!
Good-bye!
Honey, we're on our way.
You're not frightened, are ya?
I'm not frightened of anything after these three wonderful months.
It's a big place we're going to-- the West-- isn't it?
Good-bye, Buffalo Bill!
Huh?
What's the matter, boy?
Good-bye, bub. That's yours.
Gee! Thanks, mister!
Don't forget what I told ya about women.
And here's your gun.
Good hunting!
I'm Jack McCall,
Mr. Hickok.
Tickled to death to be traveling with you.
Pleased to meet you.
Hey, your toothpick's on fire.
This ain't a toothpick.
''Cigareetes,'' they call them back East.
Oh, I see.
A new fad, huh?
Hmm?
Barkeep, bring me an applejack, will ya?
Yes, sir.
You want one?
No.
I call ya.
I have ace, king, queen, jack and a ten.
Sorry, mister.
Mr. Hickok.
I'd like to speak to you.
Good evening, ma'am.
I'm Louisa Cody.
Will's told me how long you've been friends... and how you fought for him once.
He says you don't trust women.
Not as a rule, Mrs. Cody.
But in your case--
Mr. Hickok,
I'm going to help Will.
Don't you believe I can?
Well, I don't know, ma'am.
I'll open.
He killed his first Indian at 1 2.
But he's not--
At 1 4, he was riding Pony Express.
He's one of the best natural scouts on the frontier.
Will's promised to give up scouting and killing Indians... and all that nonsense.
The West is in his blood.
You can't change that.
But you've been away from it so long.
It is changing, and why shouldn't
Will change with it?
We're going to start a little hotel.
Cody?
Yes.
Someday you may be one of our neighbors with a wife of your own.
Excuse me, ma'am, but the hotel keeper seems to be in trouble... with his neighbors right now.
I'll bet you $20.
Hello, Bill.
Don't play that hand.
- Why not?
- Maybe you can trust one woman-- authorities differ-- but three?
Not on your life.
Your wife wants to talk to you.
She's outside.
Well, if you don't mind, gentlemen.
It's all right.
How much money did you lose?
About $48.
I'll sit in for you.
Any objections, gentlemen?
No, no objections at all.
We've got new blood in the game.
Heinie.
Yes, sir?
Take the gentlemen's order.
Take the order all around.
Rye for me.
Applejack, please.
Rye.
No, thank you.
Ante.
Cut.
Heinie?
Yes, sir.
Bring me something cool.
Yes, sir.
Well,
I'll bet you $50.
I'll see that and raise you 1 00.
On that watch?
Yes, it's a mighty fine watch.
Plays a tune whenever you press that little spring. See?
It ain't worth $1 50.
It is to me.
I'll redeem that watch anytime for a thousand.
All right, I'll take your word on it, and I'll up ya 300.
And I'll call ya.
They're all blue, mister.
Watch yourself.
What's the matter?
I'm calling the hand that's in your hat.
Take it off!.
Take a look,
Mr.Jayhawker.
The name is Hickok.
Hickok?
Not Wild Bill Hickok?
Mr. Hickok to you.
I'm calling this hand.
And I'm taking this pot.
Maybe I ought to shoot a couple of holes through your ears, so we'll know you.
Men like you ought to be marked.
Maybe he'll do it too.
Wouldn't be no trick at all for Bill.
He's my friend.
He can hit a dime at 30 paces.
Four times out of five.
Five times out of five.
He killed the whole McDaniels gang.
And he got 'em alone too.
Does he kill like that?
Ain't a corpse maker like him, honey.
Cash these in, Mr. Banker.
It's a pleasure,
Mr. Hickok.
Maybe I ought to take
Mr. Cody's losings too.
He's got a wife to support.
Whoa there!
Lizzie's two hours late.
Hustle your passengers off.
I'll pick the best of them for you, Calamity.
My horses ain't used to waitin'.
Back up there,Joe!
Mark three!
Look out!
Don't foul that hauser there!
Hey, there.!
Leavenworth landing!
All for Leavenworth get off.
Hey! Aboard there!
Purser!
Watch the line.
My name's John Lattimer.
You got a bunch of freight for me put aboard at St. Louis?
Yeah, lots of it consigned to Hays City.
I got my own wagons here!
I want that stuff shouldered off first up!
Right away! Hey, Tim!
Hustle that shipment forJohn Lattimer off.
Come on, boys!
Get goin'!
Hi, Calamity.
Hi, yourself.
Keepin' company tonight?
Yeah, me and my six horses.
Seven's a lucky number.
Count me in.
You sailors are all alike.
Hey, Bill!
Help me pack this outfit ashore.
Jumping Jehoshaphat!
What is this? Feathers?
Hats.
''Hats''?
Lou, Bill will take you off to the stage. I got to go see about the trunks.
This going to be the hotel orchestra, ma'am?
Bill, we're not joking about that hotel.
I guess a hotel suits you after all. Start with a birdcage and expand, huh?
Lattimer, six.
Come on, boys.!
Get along here.!
Lattimer, seven.
Lattimer, eight.
Keep 'em on your backs there.
I'm sorry, boss.
Powerful heavy to tote.
- Shut your lip!
John Lattimer, nine.
Hey!
Take this box!
Yes, sir!
Get out, you!
John Lattimer, ten.
Lattimer, 1 1, goin'to Hays City.
Don't that look like--
Farming tools.
You operate out of Hays City?
Sure! What of it?
Didn't have any use for farming tools the last time I was there.
I freight whatever they send me, and I mind my own business.
John Lattimer, 1 5.
That's a right good idea, a right, good way to keep out of trouble.
John Lattimer, 1 6.
Bill!
You mangy old coyote!
Ha!
John Lattimer, 1 8.
Bill, you're back.
Aw, you four-flushing mule.
You ain't wipin' it off.
You're rubbing it in.
Are you gonna stay in Leavenworth?
Are you?
I could.
I'm going on to Hays City.
Why didn't you write me any letters, Bill?
I didn't know you could read.
I could read if you could write.
A woman who has a fellow at every stage station... and a beau in every cavalry troop west of the Missouri--
That woman doesn't need any letters from me.
Those fellers didn't mean nothin' to me.
They did to me.
Let's forget it.
Maybe I did make a mistake.
You won't get a chance to make that mistake again.
Bill!
You'll have to excuse me.
I'm keeping a lady waiting.
I'm awfully sorry to have put you to so much trouble, Mr. Hickok.
That's all right.
I don't know what could have happened to Will.
This is the Hays City stage, ma'am. I'll fetch Will and the rest of the outfit.
Thank you.
Is that chipmunk yours?
Did ya bring her with ya?
What if I did?
It's none of your business.
Ain't it, after you run out on me?
You slab-sided, bird-totin' rat!
You brung that honky-tonk mopsy--
Shut up, Calamity.
Tip your hat when you speak to a lady.
I will, when I speak to a lady.
Aw, Bill.
Careful, Lou.
That's a big step.
Look out for Hannibal.
Will, isn't it exciting?
Have you got everything?
I've got you and the parasol and Hannibal... and boxes and hats and--
Hi, Calamity!
Well, Bill Cody!
What are you doin' in them buzzard feathers?
Pretty fancy, huh?
Calamity, I want to introduce you.
Lou, this is CalamityJane.
Everybody knows her.
Born and bred out yonder.
A dead shot, rides better than a man, drives stage.
Why, I've seen her flick the rattles off a rattle--
Say, is she your mopsy?
She's Mrs. Cody.
Your wife!
Aw.
I'm certainly glad to know ya, Mrs. Cody.
How do you do, Miss Calamity?
Canary's the name, ma'am.
I beg your pardon.
I didn't know.
Not at all, ma'am.
Four passengers for Hays City, Calamity.
Get going.
Suits me.
You'll find the backseat easy ridin', Mrs. Cody.
Thank you.
Come on, Bill. Get in.
That's no way to treat your passengers.
You ain't a passenger.
You're freight.
My name's Jack McCall.
I'm goin' to Hays City.
What are you smokin'?
Chalk?
Cigareete.
Well, get in anyway.
Another one for Hays City, ma'am.
That river clipper's sayin' good-bye to you, ma'am.
Now you're gonna have three long days of this prairie clipper.
But tomorrow's Sunday.
Do we ride on Sunday?
There's no Sunday west ofJunction City, no law west of Hays City and no God west of Carson City.
Hold tight, ma'am.
I'm holding tight.
Still travelin' together,
Mr. Hickok, huh?
What are you doin' up here?
I'm drivin'.
Get! Get up there!
Get up there!
You've been driving for three days.
You've changed horses
1 4 times.
Don't you ever change those beads you're wearing?
I ain't wearin' 'em
'cause you give 'em to me.
I'm wearin' 'em
'cause I like beads.
Oh, Will, are all the roads in Kansas like this?
No, honey!
Some of'em are pretty bad.
What's the matter?
Clem?
Take these ribbons.
Yeah?
Stranger, I wonder if you could--
Breezy!
Why, it's Bill Hickok.
I thought you was off to the war.
The war's over.
Yeah? Just beginning where I come from.
There's 2,000 or 3,000
Sioux Indians cayoodlin' around
Fort Piney with war paint on.
Wild Bill Hickok to see General Custer.
I'll see him.
Yes, sir.
How do you do, General?
Oh, hello, Hickok.
I heard you were coming to town.
I know of your reputation as a killer, and I want to warn you... that we'll tolerate no lawlessness here at Hays City.
You better get that word through to the Indians, because they've just wiped out half the garrison at Fort Piney.
- How do you know?
- I was about to report to you... before you became so interested in my accomplishments... that we've been pulling arrows out of
Colonel Carrington's old scout.
Breezy?
Yes.
Colonel Carrington told him if you didn't get ammunition to Fort Piney, they're done for.
Find Captain Reed!
Yes, sir.
I'll get that ammunition to Fort Piney somehow.
But I can't spare more than one troop to take it.
Here at Hays City,
I'm faced by Satanta's Kiowas.
The whole Sioux nation's up here.
And now Yellow Hand's on the loose with his Cheyenne.
I can't move from Hays City until I find out where that he-wolf s heading for.
He's an old friend of mine.
We used to hunt buffalo together on the Cimarron.
He's hunting men now, and I've got to locate him.
Maybe I can find him for ya.
He ought to be just about... there.
Hmph.
Oh, Captain Reed.
Yes, sir.
Hickok reports that half of Carrington's command at Fort Piney's been wiped out.
I'm sending 1 0,000 rounds of ammunition.
Have Captain Woods prepare to leave at once with a wagon train.
Mules are right handy animals, General.
What?
They can get by the Indians much better than wagons can.
Yes, he's right.
Use mules.
They'll have to get by about a thousand Cheyenne.
Why not send them east of the trail through Deep Valley?
Yes, and across the upper ford of the Republican, but who's going to guide them?
I haven't got a scout who knows that territory.
I beg your pardon, but Buffalo Bill Cody just got in town.
Cody? Yes, he knows the lay of that land.
And he's up to all Indian tricks.
He's got himself a squaw.
You'll probably find him knitting or washing dishes.
What do you mean?
He's married a ravishing little woman from points East.
I don't care if he married an Eskimo.
Tell him to come here.
His mind's set on starting a hotel.
There's an Indian war starting.
Women lying on these plains with Indian arrows in them.
Get Cody here.
- Suppose I go in his place?
- You're going after Yellow Hand.
Don't let him catch you.
He doesn't treat his prisoners very well.
Tell Cody that ammunition train is leaving before sundown.
Yes, sir.
And he'll be leaving with them.
Orderly.
Oh, Will, there's so much dirt blowing in.
It's got to blow someplace, honey.
Tumbleweed, Lou.
They won't bite ya.
Oh, dear!
There's no use fightin' the wind, Lou.
We have to bear with this land.
Oh, I know, Will.
When are we going to move into town and take over the hotel?
I'm gonna see
Jeb Masters tomorrow.
He wants to sell the Golden Rule House.
Here's your grub!
Why, come in, Miss Canary.
Hiya, Bill.
What'd you bring?
Well, I'll tell ya.
I got something to fry, and I got something to boil.
And a jug of whiskey!
Oh!
He never misses, Mrs. Cody.
I'll take that.
You've got a lot to do.
That stove smokes, and there's no mattress on the bed.
You haven't got the lamps filled yet.
Look at this place.
This is a grand shebang.
Oh, Calamity.
You could stable the queen of Sheba.
How can you say that?
It's so dusty, and I haven't got my curtains hung yet.
We'll help ya. Hey, you long-legged two-spot, give your wife a hand.
And here's the bodkin.
Hey!
Put it in that window.
Say! Look it.
That would make a pretty dress, wouldn't it?
Calamity, do you ever wear dresses?
I might if I had one.
You're going to look awfully nice in one of mine.
That curtain looks right pretty.
Bodkin Bill.
Have you had any experience with a horse blanket?
Plenty.
Lou says I've had too much.
That's too bad.
There's a horse outside waitin' for ya now.
You tryin' to trade, Bill?
Yes.
A hotel for the lives of 48 men... and 1 0,000 rounds of ammunition thrown in.
How do you do,
Mr. Hickok?
You and the bird feel at home yet, ma'am?
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
Is Custer sending that ammunition to Fort Piney?
He's hoping they'll get through... if 48 cavalrymen can dodge about 1 ,000 Cheyenne.
Birds do not eat beans,
Mr. Hickok.
You think those swatties can make it?
Depends which way
Custer sends 'em.
Through Deep Valley.
Through the upper ford of the Republican.
Yeah. They might get through that way.
They would get through if Bill Cody showed them how.
There's no trail.
Better no trail if they're dodging Cheyenne.
Will's not going.
He has nothing to do with the army now.
He's promised.
That's just what I told Custer.
What did you tell him?
That you wouldn't go.
You know that's a lie.
Mr. Hickok,
Will promised me.
You don't understand.
I can't let him go.
There are things that have to be done, ma'am.
Lincoln set a goal that we have to work toward.
He said the frontier must be made safe.
Oh, but
Lincoln's dead.
What right have the dead to tell the living what to do?
His words are alive.
Bill Cody knows that as well as I do.
If he refuses to go, you'll think he's a coward, and you know he's not.
The choice is his, ma'am.
Will, I was afraid of this.
You can't leave me.
You can't--
You've never seen the Indian tribes at war.
You've never seen men killed and mutilated and bodies of women burned... and babies dragged from their mother's arms and dashed against--
That's enough, Bill!
Why is it you aren't going, Mr. Hickok?
I have to pay a call on an old friend.
You're goin' after Yellow Hand.
Bill, you're goin' out alone!
You cold decker, ain't you got no sense?
Maybe I can get you another string of beads.
Ya ornery coot!
Good-bye, my darling.
Oh, Will, please--
I've got to go, dear.
I know every foot of the way.
I have to do my part.
Here.
I'll look out for you, Mrs. Cody.
He'll be back in a few days.
He'll be back with nary a scratch on him.
Will! Will!
Come back!
Don't cry, honey.
I wanted to tell him something.
What?
Maybe if he'd known, he wouldn't have gone.
Oh.
Well, maybe it's just as well you didn't tell him.
What is this, Louisy?
Cat?
It's sort of a Russian cat.
Say.
Look at that.
I don't know how I look, but I feel like the queen of Sheba.
You look lovely,
Calamity.
I want you to keep that dress.
Ya do?
Say, that's the first time a woman ever gave me anything.
Why, I never even seen clothes like these.
Now, if I just had me a hat!
Here, try one of these.
Oh, say, ain't that a pretty one.
Well, how do you do,
Miss Canary?
Hmph.
Hmph. Appears to me your face is kind of made out of rubber.
That old coyote's got a toad in his gullet.
Couldn't be an Indian, could it?
Honey, when you hear something yelling at night, it's just some varmint.
But when you don't hear nothin', it's an Injun.
Calamity, I want you to stay here with me.
I've never been alone before.
Now, stop worryin' about him, honey.
He's got a whole troop of cavalry ridin' herd on him.
But my Bill plays it alone, the big mule.
I bet if he could see me in this outfit, it'd be my weddin' dress.
I'd just as leave die with my boots on, but I ain't a-gonna to get married in 'em.
Can I have some shoes?
Louisy, don't look at the windows.
Don't let on anything's different.
Listen to me.
Can you ride?
Yes.
My horse is outside.
Take that coffeepot back to the stove.
Then open that door and wait.
Make believe you're helping me with my glove.
I'm gonna entertain visitors. They're Injuns.
Injuns!
Shut up. When you see them all in here, sneak to the horse.
Ride to town.
Don't stop for nothin'.
Tell 'em there's Injuns here with war paint on.
Make me some fresh coffee, honey.
Come in, fellows.
Come on in.
Don't be afraid.
I-- I got something for ya.
Look. I got some presents for ya.
See? See the pretty feather?
Sure. Sure.
It's a hat. See?
Here. Here, put it on.
Come on.
I'll show you.
Go look at the pretty feather, you painted buzzard.
Here. Here, look.
Pretty?
You don't like it, huh?
Well, here. Take this.
I got something for all of ya.
Presents for all of you.
We've been savin' 'em.
Look.
Presents for my brothers, the Cheyenne, you red hyenas.
Here. Look. See?
Look. Here.
Come on in. Look.
See? Here.
Come on.
Don't be afraid.
Look. For papoose.
See? Papoose.
Uh, want a piece of cake?
Soldier.
''Soldier''?
Me no talk Cheyenne.
I'll never tell ya where they've gone, ya hairless coyote!
Hello there! Hey!
Bill.!
You get outta here.!
Go back, Bill!
These are Yellow Hand's men.!
You're crazy.!
Shoot your way out, Bill!
You'll get a tomahawk in your brains if you keep askin' for it.
Indians will sell anything.
They might sell you.
Wild Bill Hickok, walkin' into the hands of a war party.
Custer sure picked himself a great scout.
Aw, Bill, not your watch.
What's he saying, Bill?
He wants my guns too.
Don't give 'em to him.
Don't give up your guns!
What's he saying?
He says he's got to take us to Yellow Hand first.
He can't let us go unless Yellow Hand's willing.
Well, you done it, didn't ya?
Yes, I ''done it,'' all right.
How do you do,
Mr. Hickok?
You sure must remember me.
How do you like me in dresses?
Thought you were Mrs. Cody at first, in that dress.
Oh. Mrs. Cody give it to me.
Were you in Cody's cabin when they caught ya?
Yeah, celebrating on account of Bill Cody's kid.
Bill Cody hasn't got a kid.
He's gonna have one.
He doesn't know it, does he?
He would if he stayed home where he belongs.
I'll tell him... maybe.
Say, Bill, you give up your watch... and your guns.
Couldn't have been on account of me, could it?
No. I wanted him to take me to Yellow Hand, so I can find out what he's up to.
Oh.
What do you think they'll do to us?
We'll soon find out.
You Hickok.
I know you.
Speak your own language, Yellow Hand.
I'll understand you.
You, me, speak white man tongue.
I must know you know what I say.
Remember what I told you last time we met?
I said one of us will lift the other's scalp.
Which one?
It looks like it's up to you to say.
What started you on the warpath, Yellow Hand?
Where sun rise, white man's land.
Where sun set,
Indian land.
White man come, take our land.
Kill buffalo, our food.
White man promise us food.
White man lie.
Now Cheyenne buy white man's thunder stick.
Soon war drums sound in all Indian land.
All tribes ride with Yellow Hand.
We drive white man, like buffalo, away, back to rising sun.
Yellow Hand has spoken.
Yellow Hand has spoken.
And you may be right.
But you can't drive the white man away.
Yellow Hand know.
White man send bullet.
Many, many bullet. Where?
Somebody's romancing Yellow Hand.
You tell where.
I don't know.
You tell where!
He's your friend, Bill.
Why don't you tell him they're heading east toward Leavenworth?
Yes, that's right.
To Leavenworth.
- Now I know soldier take bullet.
- They won't fit your guns.
Hickok, my friend, speak with straight tongue.
Hickok, white man friend, speak with forked tongue.
Now, you tell, which way soldier take bullet?
Bill, what's in that watch?
Bill! Bill, you got my picture. You kept it.
I couldn't get it out without scratching the case.
You've been actin' like you didn't care, and all the time--
Tie up that tongue of yours.
Look at their faces.
Let her go.
She doesn't know anything.
You too quick to say she not know.
Hickok will not tell, but Yellow Hand will know.
Now is hour of Great Bear rising.
When moon in sky here,
Yellow Hand will know.
What's he talking about the moon for?
What does he mean?
What are you thinking about?
I'm thinking about
John Lattimer's farming tools... that came up on the boat.
Oh, rifles.
Better rifles than we have.
Seven shot repeaters, and each shot may mean the life of a white man.
But what do you think they're fixin' to do to us?
I think maybe you gave them an idea what to do.
Hear them drums?
That's taps for us, ain't it, Bill?
Won't be so hard, goin' out together.
It'll be harder than you know.
Calamity, there are only two of us.
Two lives against all those men on the ammunition train.
But I don't want to die!
I don't want you to die!
Hang onto yourself.
You'll have to help me.
Just like you did the first time
I saw you, remember?
I was just a kid and no more sense than I got now, headin' down the grade with no brakes on.
I loved you then, Bill, just like I do now.
Looks like that moon's gettin' ready to show.
You never even gave me a picture, but you kept mine.
I know you care for me a little.
Couldn't you say it just once?
Maybe they'll let us go after all.
Bill Hickok!
You ornery son of a mule!
You wouldn't give a bad dime to a sick kid, would ya?
You may be right,
Calamity.
No, I ain't.
I know it.
I ain't worth a bad dime.
Bill-- Bill, every night
I talk to ya.
Wantin' ya.
I know you feel the same.
Won't you tell me?
What difference would that make now?
If only I could hear ya say it once.
It would give me somethin' to keep... like it was kind of holy, like I could keep it forever.
Calamity--
Yellow Hand find out now which way soldier go.
Bill.
Yes, Calamity, I do.
I--
I love you.
You wait.
Yellow Hand no want to kill Hickok... but must know which way soldier go with bullet.
When he know,you go free.
Hickok go free.
Don't talk to him,
Calamity!
Don't trust him!
Bill.!
Bill!
If you no tell which way soldier go with bullet,
Hickok soon be dead.
Bill Cody's with that ammunition train!
Forty-eight men are there, Calamity!
Oh, Bill! I can't!
You tell?
No.
Which way?
Oh, no! No! Don't!
Don't let them do it!
Don't! Please! Don't!
Oh!
Which way?
Don't forget Cody--
And all those men!
Remember what I told you!
They're burning him!
They're killing him!
Put out the fire!
Put out the fire!
Oh.!
Put out the fire!
Which way soldier go with bullet?
Deep Valley through the upper ford.
Squaw no lie.
Yellow Hand no lie.
You free. Go.
I couldn't help it, Bill.
Won't you look at me?
I hope
I'll never have to look at you again.
Look out, Bill!
Look out!
Thing ain't right here,
Captain Wood.
See anything?
No, but I feel it.
Things ain't right here.
We can halt over there while you take a look around.
They're caught, like rats in a trap.
They're all around us, on both sides of the river!
- We'll hold this island!
Throw your horses!
Get those ammunition packs off.
Get them out of the line of fire!
I can't see nothin' to shoot at but smoke.
Where are they?
They'll never get out now.
I gotta go down there.
You ain't goin' down there.
Get behind this tree and wait.
You've got to reach
General Custer.
I'll get there, somehow.
Head down Prairie Dog Creek.
Get a fresh mount tomorrow from the Pony Express at Simpson's.
And if Custer finds out you told Yellow Hand, he'll give you the firing squad.
He won't find out.
I'm gonna tell him.
Tell him you brought a thousand Cheyenne against his 48 men!
Set up that barricade with those saddles! Those saddles on those barricades, and hurry!
Don't go too deep with that hole or you'll get that ammunition in water!
All right, sir.
Burned through the legs.
It feels like it broke the bone.
Your knife, Bill.
Give me that scabbard for the splint.
Watch 'em, men!
They may rush us!
Never saw such rifle-fire from Indians!
They haven't let up for a minute.
There's either a million of'em, or they're using those new repeating rifles.
Look out!
They're firin' powerful fast.
It ain't like what we had at Gettysburg.
Were you at Gettysburg?
I was on the other side in that.
Then you must've been--
- Stop talkin', you two!
- Get down there!
Aim well and fire slowly.
Hold your fire, men!
That's a white man!
Cover him, McGinnis!
Cover him!
What would a white man be doin' out there?
Holy mackerel!
He hasn't got a chance!
He's still ridin'.
Drop some of them Injuns back of him!
That fellow must have nine lives!
He'll need every one of'em.
They got him!
No, they haven't!
Come on, Bill.!
Run for it.!
Keep those long legs goin'!
Hi, Bill.
Sufferin' cats!
Wild Bill!
I'll tell the captain you're here.
Tell him I expect to be here for a long time.
Hi, Bill.
You guidin' for Yellow Hand?
Where's your feathers?
Captain Wood,
Wild Bill Hickok.
Touch 'em up in those trees.
Range about 200 yards!
Hickok?
Wild Bill Hickok?
Yes, sir. He just dropped in from Yellow Hand.
Wha--
I thought Custer sent you to locate Yellow Hand.
I located him, didn't I?
Him and a few Cheyenne.
You sure did a good job.
I notice you're using his equipment.
You'll notice it's better than yours too.
Where did you get that mark on your wrist? Bracelet?
Ha. Squaw bracelet.
Takin' Bill Hickok prisoner just don't sound right to me.
No? What about Bill Cody following his nose into a Cheyenne ambush?
Hmm.
Looky here.
These Injuns were waitin' for us. They knew we was comin' to this ford.
You didn't tell 'em, Bill?
Then who did tell 'em?
I said, who did tell 'em?
I've something more important than that to tell you.
You're gonna be a father.
Huh?
A daddy.
Well, but, uh--
How did you know?
Mrs. Cody told Calamity.
Calamity told me.
Well, somebody mighta told me.
Well, uh... the news didn't leak out till after we left.
Oh, well then how--
Where did you see Calamity?
Oh, uh... around.
Has she got rawhide marks on her wrist too?
What's your guess it'll be, a boy or a girl?
It's bound to be one or the other, isn't it?
That's customary.
From what I've seen of you lately, my guess is a girl.
Girls are all right.
If it's a boy,
I suppose he'll be a bellboy in that hotel of yours.
If it's a girl, we'll keep her out of Yellow Hand's camp.
Oh!
Hey, Bill.
Hey, soldier.
Wait till I knock the tail feathers off of that turkey.
Help me over to the wagon with him.
They got Buffalo Bill,
Captain.
Keep down or they'll get you.
Where's the doctor, Captain?
They got him in the first volley.
Bandages are in the box there.
Here's a fresh one.
Sort of parted your hair,
Bill. Flesh wound.
Looks like that little stranger's gonna have a papa.
Never mind that.
We got plenty of water in the river.
Hickok.
Yes, sir?
It's gonna be a siege.
Days of it.
After dark, I'll call for volunteers to try to get back to General Custer.
I've already sent word to Custer.
Who'd you send?
Who'd you send?
- CalamityJane.
Calamity? Wha--
She oughta get through.
She'd better get through.
There you are.
I oughta have you stood up and shot.
Why don't you?
If I had the authority to do it,
I'd like nothing better, but I haven't.
I can't make you pay for what you've done.
You won't have to.
Ten hut.!
Captain Wood.
Lieutenant Burke.
Sergeant Higgins.
Corporal Brannigan.
Here today and gone tomorrow.
- Bugler Corry.
- Here, but not for long.
Seven days you been calling that roll. Tomorrow there won't be anyone left to answer it.
Then I'll answer 'em all myself.
Private Adams. Anderson.
Here, and I wish I wasn't.
I wish I had two more like you.
Bingham.
Six nights I've been listenin' to the wild talk of the wounded.
'Tis a sad lullaby.
Bronson.
Yo. What's left of me.
Cody.
- Here.
- He's up in his hotel.
Coleman.
Still here.
-Three days now since the mule meat went bad.
- It's six, I tell ya!
Why tell the Indians?
They know about it.
Keep quiet, you baboons!
Seven. Do you think you're the only one hearin' Rankin in sick bay... talkin'half the time about that hole through his lung and the rest about his kid?
He's so scared he can't count.
It's six nights.
This paper says they're expectin' trouble with the Indians.
Huh?
- No?
- Dalrymple?
Here, and hungry.
Try chewin' saddle leather.
That'll ease your stomach.
Aw.
Daniels. Dowden.
Yo.
Easton. Evans. Hickok.
No hits.
- They're savin' him for a hangin'.
- Houston.
Yo.
Hadley. Hillman.
What are you makin' that for?
Holliston.
Sure, and all the Indians won't be makin' no headstone for me.
Jenkins.
Seven days you been doin' this.
They don't answer anymore.
He's roll calling the dead!
It's six days!
What difference does it make?
''What difference does it make''?
Makes a difference to Gillon,
Harry Ketcham and Bailey.
Ray Todd must think it makes a difference where he lies out there.
They might be alive!
Alive!
Easy, son. Easy.
They might be.
You never can tell what'll happen.
I knew a fellow lived on the Kaw River by the bridge.
He used to feed a fish, a big catfish, by hand.
- What's that got to do with it?
- Now wait a minute.
That catfish got to followin' that fellow out of water for his dinner.
Every day he'd follow him more.
And one night when the man was walkin'home across the bridge, not noticin'the catfiish was followin'him.
Now that fiish had never seen a bridge before.
He fell off... and he drowned.
- Ah, fish can't drown.
- That must've been a narrow bridge.
Holy thunder.!
Look at them Injuns.!
Every man up this way!
Hurry, men, hurry!
- Get the wounded out to load the guns!
- Don't shoot till
I give the command.
- Hand me up another rifle.
- Keep your heads down if you wanna keep them on.
Look like buffalo, don't they?
A volley'll stop buffalo.
Volley fire. Ready!
Not yet.
But, Bill!
Hold your fire, men.
Wait for the command.
- They're riding us down!
- Don't wait.! Let 'em have it.!
Not yet!
Now!
Fire!
Load faster.!
Gimme that.!
I'm doing the best I can.
Fire at the center!
Split that charge!
Fire!
- Who was that?
- Keep your barrels red hot!
Fire at will, men!
This one's mine!
- We've turned 'em!
- Now they're goin' down both sides!
Houston!Jack!
Cover the left flank!
Where are you going, you idiot?
Hey, Bill, come back here!
Are you crazy?
- Hey, Dave, help me cover him.
- Cover the right flank!
Load your guns, men!
Load your guns! Remember, you're still in the army.
Gimme some water.
I gotta have water.
What's the matter?
Can't you hear me?
Load your guns.!
- What's the use? We can't stand another charge.
- We may have to.
No.! We can't.
The dead can't fiight anymore.
Why don't you call roll now?
You're afraid? I'll call it for you. Private Dowden.!
- You load your guns!
- Corporal Brannigan.
Load your guns.!
Why don't you tell
Brannigan to load his gun?
- I'm telling you.! Get up.!
- I won't!
Save that fighting for the Indians!
You'll see.
Hold onto yourself, fella.
There's nobody left.
You'll see.
Why don't you tell your bugler to sound assembly?
Stop blubbering and reload your gun!
He can't answer.
Look at him.!
Look at him.!
Saints above.
He's answering to his name.
Yes, it's the dead calling.
- Stop it, men!
Stop it. Listen.
It's Bugler Corry.
He's sounding the charge!
Come on, men, it's a charge!
No, you fools! No!
What are you waiting for?
The dead want us.
McGinnis, hold 'em back.
Fall in men!
- It's the charge.
Don't ya hear it?
- Yes, I hear it.
Come on, follow me!
The boy's right.
It's horses.
They're charging.
Get ready, men!
We'll go down fightin'!
Come on.!
There they are, over there!
You can see 'em!
- Holy saints!
[ Bugle Playing ''Charge'' ]
They know we're alive.
We're okay.
Well, Yellow Hand didn't get that ammunition he was hankerin' for.
He would have, if Calamity hadn't gotten through to Custer.
She did a good job, all right.
- She must've told Yellow Hand.
- Let her alone.
She never was good.
Why don't somebody do somethin'about it?
Only 1 8 come back out of 48.
The Cheyenne must've paid her plenty to tell 'em.
Paid this woman in money, but our soldiers paid in blood.
What are you gonna do?
I'll show you what we're gonna do.
Talk's cheap, ya loudmouthed liar.
Hey, you.
Let me out!
All right, you dirty mule-skinner.
If you want it-- Ow!
If she was a man, we'd know what to do with her.
Go ahead, you crossbred rat!
If you was a man, you wouldn't be here!
Run her out of town!
Get some tar.!
Tar and feathers is too good for her.
That's the way to talk!
Get a rail.!
Here. Here's a rail.
Gimme that hammer.
Why don't somebody get behind her and get that whip?
- Why don't you?
- Get the feathers and tar.
There's a rail.
What do you want with a rail,Jack?
- Bill!
- We're gonna run her out of town.
Why?
You know what she done?
She told Indians--
Well, she's a woman, isn't she?
Keep out of this, Bill Hickok.
And women talk a little too much sometimes.
This woman is gonna get what's coming to her.
Let's ride her out of town.
And men talk a little too much sometimes too!
Those men had wives.
I know what's on your minds!
Yes, there were soldiers killed.
I was there.
I saw them.
Huh?
And they were killed with bullets-- bullets from repeating rifles.
Who'd sell rifles to Indians?
Lincoln said this country's got to be made safe.
Those are his words.
And I'm on my way to settle this matter with the man who sold those rifles.
It wouldn't please me to be the man Bill Hickok's goin' after.
Me neither!
I knew there was monkey business goin'on.
You're right.
And there's liable to be bullets flyin' around this way any minute, so I'd advise you to get inside, off the street.
Well--
I was goin' home anyway.
- I'll go with you,Jack.
- I got a long ways to go myself.
Lattimer's ''crookeder'' than a rattlesnake. You can't go after him alone. His men--
I started this alone and I'll finish it alone.
Why should I stake you to go diggin' for gold?
They found gold and plenty of it right there in the Black Hills.
That's Sioux country.
That don't matter. There's gold there at the grass roots.
So, you're goin' on the dodge, desertin' after gold.
You know what Custer does to deserters.
I know what he'd like to do to you.
He just got back and he's boilin' mad about Cheyenne
Indians and repeatin' rifles.
He can't do nothin'. Let him make his complaint to Washington and he'll find that out!
The army's gettin' riled--
The army can't stop me!
There's bigger men than the army in this with me.
Mr. Lattimer.
I'm busy, McCall.
I want to do you a big favor, Lattimer.
What's on your mind?
Hickok's after you.
Wild Bill.
He says you're the cause of all these Indian massacres.
He's comin' in here now.
All right.
You better get out.
You won't forget that I warned you?
Get out.
Get in there, you three.
Maybe I'll have a job for you.
Hello, Hickok.
That's the name, ain't it?
Met you in Leavenworth.
Hear you been doin' a little scoutin' for Custer.
Did you see anything?
Yellow Hand's been farming with your farming tools.
You know what this is?
Skunk.
Yes.
I'm not armed, Mr. Hickok.
I'm not armed.
I'll give you three minutes to fix that.
I'll be waiting outside.
- I'm just leaving town.
- You're not leaving town unless dead men can walk.
Come in here, you fellows.
Now. I'm gonna stake ya, all three of you.
I'm gonna stake you to 50 Double Eagles.
I've got a wagon train leaving for the Black Hills tonight.
I'm gonna get you away from
Custer and safe out of town.
That's great, Mr. Lattimer.
But first, there's that little job I want you boys to do for me.
You're crazy. Lattimer won't fight you fair. You ain't got the sense you was born with.
Ah, Bill, don't our love mean nothin' to ya?
Our love-- if that's what you want to call it-- all that died back on that island where everything else was dying.
No, Bill, no!
I'll go get Cody.
Maybe he can talk some sense into you, ya big mule!
Get off the street.
You better take cover for a few minutes.
You think you own this town.
I'm just walkin' through it.
And us fellas can get out of your way, can't we, just like we was dirt?
Suit yourself.
All right, Mr. Long Hair.
You're too durn friendly with Injuns to suit me.
You shouldn't have said that, soldier.
What are you gonna do about it, ya gun-totin' windbag?
Oh, substituting for Lattimer.
I can't shoot at that uniform.
If you want action, take it off.
Yeah, and get a slug while I'm doin' it.
Take it off.
I'll give you that much time.
I never draw on a man who isn't ready.
- Bill.! Bill.!
Come on, Bill, let's get out of here.
Sit here, Bill, out of sight.
Close that door, Lou.
Easy, Bill.
That bullet went clean through, but it's bleedin' bad.
Get some water, Lou, quick.
And some clean linen.
You brought this man to our house; a murderer.
Lou!
When is this going to stop?
When will it ever stop?
This killing and killing!
Why don't they kill him too?
Then you can be next and then me and--
Lou, he's my friend.
I didn't mean to bother you, ma'am. I'll be going.
Can I take your horse, Bill?
You can have everything
I've got, Bill, but--
You sit right down again,
Mr. Hickok.
You can't go bleeding like that, whatever you've done.
He's done plenty.
Those men were soldiers.
He'll have every trooper of the Seventh after him now.
Get some towels, Will.
I'll be as quick as I can, Mr. Hickok.
Thank you, ma'am.
Here you are, Lou.
There's hot water on the stove.
Hold this, Mr. Hickok.
I never was a murderer.
I never did fight unless put upon.
Thou shalt not kill.
No ghosts ever come bothering me.
It was always the other man or me... in a fair fight.
What right have you to judge who is to live or to die?
Put away your guns,
Mr. Hickok.
I can't do that, ma'am, not till I find John Lattimer.
Hey,Jake, gimme some more light.
Ready, boys?
Yeah.
Which way, Mr. Lattimer?
South, until we get out of town, then we head north.
Say, where are them three soldiers we're takin'?
They're staying in Hays City, but I'm goin'.
Get on your wagon.
It's dark enough now, Bill.
You oughta head up north.
Hide out in the Black Hills.
That's bad Indian country, but it'll be safer for you than here.
I'm going into town first.
You're crazy, Bill!
I'd be crazier if I didn't do what
I think I ought to.
Bill, open up.
It's me.
Did they hurt you much, Bill?
I'm all right.
I couldn't come till it got dark. I was scared they'd be watchin' me.
I know you don't want to see me, but I gotta tell you somethin', Bill.
Custer's ordered you brought in dead or alive.
The troopers have combed every hidin' down by the river and they're headin' this way.
He's goin'to fiind Lattimer.
Lattimer's gone.
He pulled out with his wagons.
Where?
Nobody knows.
I'll find him.
Of course you will. Someday you're bound to, only don't try to find his trail now.
Just try to save yourself from Custer's men. There's no tellin' what they'll do.
If Lattimer's pulled out with his wagons, those wagons are loaded.
And I know what
I've got to do.
That's a trooper.
Hear his saber?
Get in there, Bill, quick.
You might set the table for three, Mrs. Cody.
Who's there?
Courier from
General Custer.
General Custer's compliments.
You're to report to him right away.
How do you do, ma'am?
Howdy, soldier.
Hi.
What's up?
Custer's been ordered to move against Sitting Bull and the
Sioux up in Big Horn country.
What does General Custer want Will for?
The General doesn't let me in on all his secrets.
Come on, get a move on.
Go ahead.
I'll be right behind you.
Grub's ready. Hustle them dishes. I'm cavin' in all over.
Light out, Bill.
I've got a pack all fixed for you and I brought a horse.
Good-bye, ma'am, and thank you for everything.
Thanks for the coat,
Bill Cody. I'll take good care of it.
Take care of what's inside of it, you old bushwhacker.
Will, what does
General Custer want of you?
Bill. Bill, you ain't fit to ride far.
Why don't you lay up someplace and take care of that arm?
That's what I'll do.
I'll need this arm when I find Lattimer.
Ah, forget it.
You ain't got a chance against Lattimer's men.
Hmm. I've got nothing to lose.
Nothin' but your life!
When you talk like that,
I could bounce a rock off n your bean.
Why don't you try it next time you see me?
When'll that be, Bill?
Where?
Oh, up around
Deadwood someplace.
You can never tell.
I gotta get out of here too after what I done.
Well, I guess this is good-bye, eh, Bill?
Where are you going?
Oh, up around Deadwood someplace, I guess.
I don't give a hoot where I go.
You're well-named.
A child of calamity.
Always gettin' yourself into trouble.
Bill--
Bill, I reckon maybe you don't hate me.
Do you?
Maybe you're just bein' nice to me because you think you won't ever see me again.
Sure. Sure,
I'll see ya again.
This is a big country, and trails cross... sometimes.
Thought these
Big Horn Mountains was full of Indians.
Well, I ain't seen any Indians yet, but I'll swear to Moses there's somethin' followin' us.
Git!
Want your coat back,
Bill?
No. I want some grub.
Well, how do you like your eggs?
I like 'em very much.
You got any?
No.
I got some jerky and a little bacon and a little coffee.
You must've been mighty frugal over the last six weeks since you been gone.
I haven't any grub left.
Well, you're welcome to anything I got, Will.
I know that, Bill.
Build up a little fire and we'll have coffee.
Given up ridin' a horse?
Indians got it.
Mine too.
I see you got holes in your boots.
That's from followin' a long-legged man.
Me?
You.
What were you followin' me for?
Did you have something you wanted to tell me?
I reckon I did.
I thought you were off with Custer.
Custer sent me to bring you back.
Slice up some of that bacon, Bill.
Have a piece of jerky.
Thanks, Bill.
Well, I guess we got a few coffee beans left.
Enough for about two cups if we make it weak.
How's Lou?
I ain't seen her, Bill, for weeks.
She went home to St. Louis the day after you left.
She wanted to be with her mother when--
And what have you decided to call it?
I guess Lou will decide that.
Yeah. She's a fine woman, Bill.
She fixed my arm, so I can pull a gun as quick with my left as I can with my right.
Well, that's fine,
Bill.
It might come in handy for you.
It will.
This is a hostile country.
If you get some water, we'll get this coffee goin' quick.
Can't understand why Custer sent you.
He says I'm the only man you wouldn't kill.
Seems to me Custer's takin' a whole lot for granted.
Well, there it is.
I have an order from the United States Army to bring you back.
So I gather.
Dead or alive.
Which way do you aim to do it?
Alive.
No, Bill.
It's too bad they had to send you. I'm sorry.
But they did, Bill.
Did you hear that?
What's that Indian doing with that Seventh Cavalry stuff?
That flag's shot to pieces.
- Where'd you get that flag?
That's an officer's coat, and there's a bullet hole through it.
Do you understand him?
He says
Custer's dead!
Wiped out with his whole battalion.
He says Yellow Hand's comin' up from the south with his Cheyenne... to join Sitting Bull.
He says there'll be no more white man.
If the Cheyenne reach Sitting Bull, he's right.
Where's the nearest regiment?
Merritt.
He's moving up to join Crook.
You know his line of march?
He's coming up through Deadwood.
Find him.
He says the white man friend is bringing rifles to Sitting Bull.
- That's Lattimer.
To the new village in the canyon.
That's Deadwood.
You go for Merritt and tell him to get between
Sitting Bull and the Cheyenne.
Remember, Bill, you're my prisoner.
I'll see ya in Deadwood.
We'll settle it there.
[''Oh.! Susanna'' On Piano ]
- I seen it myself.
- One nugget?
Yes, sir.!
Twenty-three ounces.
The biggest nugget I seen in Deadwood yet.
Dave, the biggest liar
I've seen in Deadwood yet is you.
I ain't tryin' to sell you the claim.
I'm caught.
Now, Calamity, what did you wanna do that for?
Drinks ain't free, Dave.
If you was a man,
Calamity--
I ain't, so plunk down four bits.
You're a good barkeep,
Calamity, but you're awful ornery.
Hello, Calamity.
Sherry and egg.
Eggs are a dollar apiece.
I said egg and sherry.
You'll get whiskey and egg.
Would you like to try runnin' me out of this town too,Jack?
No, Calamity.
I don't bear you a bit of hard feeling anymore.
Well, that's just fine.
'Cause I bear you a-plenty.
Now, say, Calamity.
You oughta be makin' up to me.
I'm gonna be a big man in this country.
You'll have to grow about a foot, won't ya?
When I get hold of a pile of money-- which I aim to, and soon-- you'll be treatin'me right.
So, you staked a claim?
Nah, not me.
Those fellas are lookin' for gold in the ground.
I aim to find it on top.
If it ain't in the ground, where is it?
I ain't sayin'!
[ In Normal Voice ]
I ain't sayin'.
All I'm sayin' is
I'm gonna be a big man in this Black Hills country.
Yes, sirree, a big man, like Wild Bill Hickok.
Say, whatever become of Bill?
I couldn't tell ya.
For all I know, he may be dead.
[ Whistling ]
The man that killed him must be ridin' high.
The man don't live that could kill him.
Though you done your best.
You told Lattimer, Bill was looking for him in Hays City.
Hickok don't know that, does he? It ain't true.
There ain't a word of truth in it.
Lucky for you
Bill ain't here.
You can throw this old outfit away or burn it.
I don't think they'll burn.
Hey.
You like-a the haircut?
No, no haircut.
Have you seen any freighting or hauling around here?
No, no freighting.
No hauling.
Everybody got a mine.
Everybody dig and a-dig.
Nobody got-a time for Tony no more.
Nobody take a bath no more!
Hey, don't you ever put tobacco in that pipe?
Smells like an octopus.
Hello,Jack.
What's that army horse doin' here?
There ain't been any soldiers around here in weeks,
Mr. Lattimer, but the Fifth Cavalry's comin' in.
We'll be gone before they get in.
My wagons oughta be here in a few minutes.
I need some barberin'.
I ain't seen no Indian guide.
Give him time.
Sitting Bull said he'd send him.
Take it easy.
Mr. Lattimer.
I'm gettin' kinda jumpy about those wagons.
I'll buy ya one.
That's nice of you,
Mr. Lattimer.
A drop of rye will set me up just fine.
You don't happen to have seen any wagons going through... loaded with farming tools?
Now what does anybody want-a with-a farming tools?
They got no time to farm.
Hey. Why don't you want to get the haircut?
Short hair makes the Indians mad, and they're mad enough already.
Thank-a you too much.
He's-a fine fellow.
Bill!
Hello, Calamity.
Ah, Bill.
Gee, you're back.
I been watchin' and askin' and nobody's seen ya.
Nobody's heard.
I haven't been out in what you call society.
I had one caller, though. Bill Cody.
He found you, then.
Say, Bill, you didn't--
No.
No, he's all right.
I'm meetin' him here.
I'm sure glad of that.
Wasn't your fault, them three soldiers gettin' killed.
Say, Bill. You won't have to move on, will ya?
No, I got a hunch this is gonna be my last camp.
You're settlin' down?
You're gonna stay here?
I got a feelin'
I'm gonna stay here.
Bill, you need a drink.
I been thinkin'.
The West is gettin' to be a new kind of place.
Bill Cody's done the right thing.
He's changed.
What room is there gonna be for a two-gun plainsman?
You're talkin' crazy.
You're the best man in this country.
I don't know who thinks so.
I think so, Bill.
If you think Cody done right settlin' down and all, maybe that's what you'd like to do.
I mean, have a home and things... and have somebody to cook your meals for ya and--
Doesn't sound so bad.
Oh, Bill--
Calamity, now you gotta listen to me.
I didn't do nothin',
Mr. Hickok.
- I didn't do nothin'.
- What's he talkin' about?
He sneaked and told Lattimer you was lookin' for him back in Hays City.
She's lying, Mr. Hickok.
She's lying.
McCall, a year ago I'd have shot you dead on sight.
But now--
Go buy yourself a drink.
You're the luckiest rat alive.
I'm beginnin' to think
Mrs. Cody was right.
Who am I to decide whether a man's to live or die?
You feelin' all right, Bill?
No Injun guide yet,Jake.
No? Well, if you don't mind, then I'll go put down a drink.
All right.
Go ahead, boys.
Wet your whistles.
Mr. Lattimer.
Hickok is in town.
Hickok? Where?
In the Bella Union.
Get the boys back, quick.
Hey,Jake!
Mr. Lattimer wants you--
Shut up, you fool!
Lattimer.
Stay in here,
Calamity.
Oh, Bill.
This is the only thing
I have worth keeping.
If you got a wrong hunch, don't go out there.
Don't forget to wind it.
You're a mule-headed man,
Bill Hickok!
Get on your wagons, boys.
Just a minute.!
I wanna talk to you.
Any objections, gentlemen?
Where you goin' with the wagons?
Goin' out of town.
What you got 'em loaded with?
Buffalo hides.
You can see, can't ya?
Your wagons are headed north,
Lattimer.
You're not selling buffalo hides to Sitting Bull's Indians?
Take off the top hides.
I wanna see what's under 'em.
Jake.
NotJake.
You.
Oh. All right.
I don't know what you're lookin' fer, but if you want it, you're gonna get it.
Keep your hands off your guns, or there'll be more dead men than this town can afford to bury.
You gentlemen also sell farming tools?
Get on ahead of me, inside the Bella Union.
Wait a minute.
Don't you belong to this outfit,Jack?
Huh?
Oh, no, Mr. Hickok.
I just know Mr. Lattimer.
You knew
Mr. Lattimer,Jack.
Better get inside too.
Oh, sure.
Sure, Mr. Hickok.
Whatever you say.
- Who was that fella he shot?
- Never saw him before.
He oughta know better than to pull a gun on Bill Hickok.
Cody and the Fifth Cavalry are on their way.
Keep an eye out for 'em.
The rest of you, keep out!
[ Man ]
I'm not going to go in there.
Gentlemen, we're gonna stay right here for a while.
What'll it be?
Name your poison.
Jack, how about tending bar?
We may be here for quite a long wait.
What are we waitin' for?
Jake, don't reach for anything but your glass.
That goes for the rest of you.
Keep your hands away from your guns unless you want... fiive cheap funerals in Deadwood instead of one.
We're waiting till
General Merritt gets here with the Fifth Cavalry... and takes over
Sitting Bull's rifles.
Any objection?
May be an hour, may be a day.
When I have to wait,
I believe in entertainment.
Furthermore,
I'm short of funds.
Cards, bartender.
Find some fresh ones and some chips.
Proceed, gentlemen, over there.
You first, if it's all the same to you.
I'll take the one without arms.
Keep your hands on the table, all of you.
You bank.
I don't hear no shootin'.
It's powerful quiet in there.
Wonder what they're doin'.
Best way to find out is to--
You keep out of this!
Let Bill Hickok play his own hand.
That's-a just what he's a-doin'.
He's a-playin' cards.
Playin' cards?
Tony must be crazy.
- Let's go in and find out.
- No, no.
I see him so plain.
He's a-sittin'down with his back-a this way.
His back?
Cut for deal.
Looks like we're being played for suckers.
Your deal.
Any sign of the cavalry yet, Calamity?
Not yet, Bill.
I hope my prisoner hasn't escaped.
General Merritt, if he's done the job he set out to do, do you think the government would be a little lenient with him?
Mr. Cody, in matters where its sympathies are concerned, the government has been known to bend a little.
- You better not go in there.
- Bill, there's an Injun comin' in the door.
Hello, Charlie.
Come in.
- Charlie's a friendly Injun.
- Yes, I know Charlie.
How many?
Gimme two.
Three to me.
Sit over here, Charlie, where I can keep an eye on you.
Charlie took a shot at me once.
I was too far away.
Too bad you wasn't closer.
He got my horse.
Charlie'd been the biggest man in the West if he'd have killed you, Hickok.
Injuns understand things like that.
Kill a big man and that makes you a big man.
Killin'you, Hickok, is an honorjust waitin' for somebody.
You,Jake?
Not me, Bill, not me.
I'm facing you. Only way to down a man like you is from the back.
Raise ya five.
Seein' that and up five.
Get your foot off my chair,
Calamity. It's bad luck.
Don't go against your luck, Bill.
Your say,Jake.
The soldiers! That means a rope necktie for us!
Sit down!
We'll play out this hand.
- All right.
- This game ain't over yet.
It's almost over.
Calamity, find Cody and General Merritt.
Bring 'em here.
- Play your hand.
- I'm callin'ya, Hickok.!
Black aces and eights.
Your luck's changed.
Three queens.
I'm afraid you lose, Hickok.
A man's bound to lose, sooner or later.
Bill? Bill!
Let's get outta here!
Those fellas just shot
Bill Hickok!
Arrest those men!
Come on, you.
Get up.
Where is he?
Where's Bill?
There's your prisoner,
General Merritt.
We won't forget what Bill Hickok has done, Cody.
We'll remember.
All of us will.
All of us.
That's one kiss you won't wipe off.

41 st Street.
Here, son.
- Castle?
- That's right.
- Cash.
- Oh, cash.
Wait a minute.
Mr. Fields, can I trouble you for $ 10 advance on my next week's salary.
You'll never have a next week's salary.
You already spent it last week.
Mr. Fields, if my next week's salary can make a beautiful lady happy this week...
...it's my duty to spend it. Thanks.
- Here you are. Keep the change.
- Oh, thanks.
Say, Vernon, if those flowers are for Miss Ford, you're aiming too high.
- We're having supper after the show.
- But you haven't got the right ammunition.
- The what?
- Spondoodles, mazuma.
Something that you second comics never have.
But someday I'll be the first comic, after you.
- Thanks.
- I'm sure you're wrong about Miss Ford.
A lot of fellas have been wrong about Miss Ford. And you're next.
Look out.
She trifles with men's hearts.
Let her trifle with mine.
I'm not doing anything important with it.
- Addie.
- Yes, Miss Ford.
Be ready to dress me immediately after the finale.
I'm having supper at Rector's with Mr. Vanderpool.
Miss Ford.
- You're on next Mr. Castle.
- All right, John.
- Will you wear this tonight?
- Tonight?
- Remember our supper date.
- Oh, of course, I remember.
But my head is splitting and I should be in bed this minute. You'll forgive me, darling.
- How about tomorrow?
- Tomorrow?
Sunday. Well, I'm going to the beach at New Rochelle with my mother.
- Suppose I meet you at the club house?
- Oh, dear, well...
...if it's all right with Mother.
I'm so sorry about tonight.
Well, what did I tell you?
Mr. Fields, could you bag me for a round trip ticket to New Rochelle.
By the sea, by the sea
By the beautiful sea
You and I, you and I
Oh, how happy we'll be
When each wave comes a-rolling in
We will duck or swim
And we'll float
And fool around the water
Over and under
And then up for air
Pa is rich, Ma is rich
So now why do we care?
I love to be beside your side
Beside the sea
Beside the seaside
By the beautiful sea
Hello, pup. Who are you?
Well.
Mr. Castle. Mr. Castle.
Yes. Over here.
- You waiting for Miss Ford?
- Miss Claire Ford, yes.
She just phoned. Said, tell Mr. Castle her head was still splitting.
Oh, I see.
It's too bad.
Lots of other ladies sitting around here, Mr. Castle.
I dare say. Thanks.
- Have you seen a dog around here?
- Yes. Where is he?
Who is that fella?
Come on, there.
Get up you.
Oh, you poor little thing.
- Walter.
- I'm coming, Sailor.
- Isn't he your dog?
- Isn't he yours?
I never saw him until a moment ago.
Well, it must belong to somebody.
Walter, take the dog into the boat.
Well, I don't like the look of this,
Miss Irene.
- Take the dog.
- Drowning that dog to get acquainted.
Some of these whippersnappers go pretty far.
- I beg your pardon.
- Don't mind Walter.
- You all right?
- Yes.
Climb in.
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
Goodbye.
Walter, let the gentleman into the boat.
That's exactly what you want to do, ain't it?
No, no.
I'm quite comfortable, thank you.
Oh, please get in.
Thank you very much.
You are wonderful to jump in to rescue a little stray dog.
- I'm very keen on dogs.
- Me too.
I keep a sort of boarding house for wandering dogs in my dressing room.
- Dressing room?
- Yes, in the theatre.
In the theatre?
- Are you an actor?
- Well, yes.
- You're not the only actor in this boat.
- Do you act?
Me? No, I just work for the family.
- You?
- Hi.
She's a genius.
Walter practically raised me and he's sort of prejudice.
What show are you with?
She played the fairy queen in Miss Dodd's
Seminary's Annual Entertainment.
- Oh, amateur shows.
- Dances like a sun beam.
What's your name?
- My name's Castle.
- My name's Foote.
My name will be mud when I try to explain this to your mother.
- Why don't you start the motor?
- Because it's broke, that's why.
- Looks all right.
- Looks broke.
Irene was just 3, then.
Don't you love the flowers?
- And this is when she was 7.
- Very fetching.
The next one is Pinafore. Being English yourself, Mr. Castle, I know you'll like it.
She was in a school production when she was 10. Do you remember, Hubert?
- Oh, yes.
- Well, here's our dog.
- Our dog?
- I asked all around the neighborhood...
...and nobody claims him, so Sailor wants to keep it.
- Well, he's very sweet.
- Here boy. Here boy.
- What train you figure on making?
- The 5:30.
I figure the 4:30.
Oh, look.
How nice.
Irene's going to do a rendition for you.
- For me?
- Yes.
She's never had a chance to do it for a professional audience before.
I think I'll go out and work in the garden a bit.
Hubert, you stay right here.
I think my clothes must be dry by now.
You sit here, sir.
Ladies and gentlemen, an imitation of Miss Bessie McCoy...
...doing her famous number,
"The Yama Yama Man." Thank you.
Mr. Castle, she may be a little nervous.
I'm a little nervous myself.
Every little tot at night
Is afraid of the dark, you know
Some big Yama Man they sing
As off to bed they go
Yama Yama Yama Man
Terrible eyes and a face of tan
If you don't watch out
He will sting you
Without a doubt, if he can
Maybe he's hiding behind the chair
Ready to spring out at you unaware
So run to your mama for here comes
The Yama Yama Yama Man
Bravo.
- You did very nicely, dear.
- Thank you.
- Well, sir?
- That was fine.
Yes, sir that certainly was fine.
Thanks very much.
Do you really mean it or you're just saying it?
No, really, I mean, you gave it quite a professional touch... here and there.
Here and there?
I mean everywhere.
It was very nice.
Now, if you'll excuse me, you see my train...
Oh, I see.
I'm sorry, I wish I can stay and see it again.
- But I'm afraid...
- You afraid to see it again?
- Not at all.
- You don't wanna see it again?
- What the young man means is that...
- Hubert...
...let Mr. Castle decide.
- I would like to, but I must go.
- You'd like to see it again?
- Walter, he didn't say that.
- The man said...
- No, he didn't.
- I'd like to see it again, except my train...
- No trouble at all.
Now Walter, not unless Mr. Castle wants to.
- I knew he didn't.
- I do.
Well, all right.
There's a possibility you may catch the 8:15.
I understand every one of your criticisms, except for one you sort of mumble.
Oh, that one.
- What does "ham" mean?
- That's just an expression.
Well, what does it mean?
In the theater we speak of certain actors as hams.
Well, that makes me feel so professional.
- Am I a real ham?
- Well, yes you're a little ham.
Oh, wonderful.
And after the way we ran.
Come Josephine
In my flying machine
Going up all on
Goodbye
Come Josephine
In my flying machine
Going up she goes
Up she goes
Balance yourself like
A bird on a beam
In the air she goes
There she goes
Up, up a little bit higher
Oh, my moon is on fire
Come Josephine
In my flying machine
Going up
All on
Goodbye
- Come on.
- Come on.
Go it, Vernon.
You didn't tell me you can dance like that.
- You're marvelous.
- Thanks.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
All aboard. Go ahead, kiss her.
Next Sunday is a long way off.
Next Sunday? Oh, yeah.
All aboard.
Hurry up, bashful.
Oh, you beautiful doll
You great big beautiful doll
Let me put my arms about you
I could never live without you
Oh, you beautiful doll
You great big beautiful doll
If you ever leave me
How my heart would ache
I want to hug you
But I fear you'd break
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, you beautiful doll
- Oh, Irene, I can hardly wait.
- Does he dance soon?
Oh, here he is.
You see he's in the next scene and he plays with the star.
The Barber Lew Fields
The Customer Vernon Castle.
- My aunt once knew an opera singer.
- Did she?
- Wait till you see Vernon dance.
- Isn't it wicked?
I mean knowing an actor.
- He's coming down the stairs now.
- Are you sure?
Leave him to me.
Leave him to me.
I'll show him for insulting my daughter.
- Say something.
- L...
That's real ham comedy.
- What did you say?
- Ham.
- Where?
- You're looking at two of the best...
...right down there.
- Done it again, Vernon.
- Yeah.
- You were great today, Vernon.
- Oh, thanks.
Thanks very much.
Oh, hello.
Have you been out front?
How did you like it?
You were terrible.
Oh, so Ms. Irene Foote... actress of New Rochelle... thinks I'm terrible.
Thanks for taking the trouble to come back and tell me so.
You could be a perfectly wonderful dancer if you wanted to.
Instead you waste your talent letting people set fire to you.
It takes talent to make people laugh.
And I like being set fire to.
- Well, I won't have you doing it.
- Oh, you won't.
Say, what makes you so excited about me?
You have something no comedian will ever have and you're wasting it.
What other reason could there be?
Oh, I don't know. Girls, especially young girls, sometimes gets crushes on actors...
- Oh, I didn't...
- You called me a ham.
Well, you're a ham with mustard.
Oh, I know what it means.
And if you think I had interest in coming back here, you're mistaken.
- Wait.
- Don't think I'll annoy you...
...with my intentions, Mr. Castle. Just go on, be funny with soap on your face...
...and get to be a first comedian.
I thought you could be a first dancer.
A very beautiful first dancer.
Because you are a beautiful dancer, but you're so smug and conceited...
...that you can't see any further than your funny nose.
There!
Was you expecting someone, Sailor?
Can't a person sit in their own front yard on a Sunday without expecting somebody.
I knew he's a fly-by-night.
I knew it the minute I seen him.
- Who?
- The fellow you're not expecting.
Hello there.
Is Ms. Foote at home?
She's not?
Did she go out?
Come on, Zowie.
Come on, Zowie.
Come on, Zowie. Come on.
That's it.
- My, it's getting warm, isn't it, Walter?
- Hello.
Oh, hello, Mr. Castle.
I just happened to be out this way, so I stopped by to see if the dog is all right.
Oh, Zowie?
Oh, he's just fine, thank you.
Thought he might be sick, that's why I came out.
- No, he's just fine.
- That's good.
See, I thought he might be sick and just thought I'd...
Come out.
My, what a beautiful automobile.
- Is it yours?
- Just a little runabout.
- There's nothing like a good spin.
- Makes you dizzy.
No, it doesn't, Walter.
It's just I'm not one way or another about it.
Well, I guess I'd better be running along.
Bye.
Well, I'm glad the dog is all right.
Go on.
Go on.
Go on.
Go on.
Oh, dear.
Here, Zowie. Here, Zowie.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Oh, Zowie, you bad little dog.
Sailor, you get down out of that contraption. It ain't safe.
Smile...
...walk...
...cross in front. To the audience.
- To each other.
- To each other.
- Cross in front.
- Cross in front.
- To the audience.
- To each other.
- Cross in front...
- That's enough.
We get two bows we'll be doing very well.
If we keep on like that, it won't be long before we can ask Mr. Fields for a trial.
Cuba pressed by Spain appeals to Uncle Sam for aid.
Niagara Falls.
That's quite a place for...
I mean, that's quite a place for people to go.
Oh, you mean on honeymoons?
Yeah.
Devil's Island. That's interesting too.
- Irene.
- Yes?
We've only known each other about three months.
Irene.
Irene, have you seen my copy of Vogue?
Oh, here it is, Mother.
- Anything yet?
- Not yet.
Well, I don't wanna interrupt anything.
You were saying that we've known each other for nearly three months.
Yes, you see my one aim in life...
...has always been to keep from getting involved.
"Vernon don't get involved,"
I've always said.
I mean I used to say.
Well, what do you say now?
Well, you know, I think when people dance well together...
...it's because they're sympathetic to each other.
In fact, that's part of what I was getting at.
Dancing brings people closer together.
I don't mean only closer together...
Oh, good evening, darling.
- Good evening, Vernon.
- Good evening, sir.
- Hello, Dad.
- Anything happened while I was out?
- Everybody finished with the paper?
- Oh, I'll get it for you, Dad.
Oh, thank you.
Some new records I brought.
Somebody flying an airship across the English Channel.
Must have been in a hurry.
Dr. Foote, Mrs. Foote wants to see you right away.
Excuse me.
- Can't you leave them alone?
- I've been leaving them alone all winter.
Aren't we ever going to use that parlor again?
Do you like this tune?
Only when you're in my arms
I can reach up to heaven
And pluck out a star from the blue
It's true
But only when you're in my arms
I can live without riches
And still have a million or two
It's true
But only when you're in my arms
Though I'm ambitious
My wishes
Have always been simple and few
Give me the moonlight
The music
And darling an armful of you
I can see myself doing
The things that I never could do
It's true
But only when you're in my arms
Irene, look, I'm terribly in love with you.
I never thought I'd fall in love but I have, and I'm glad I have.
And will you please marry me?
Yes.
- I'm in love with you too.
- You...
Well...
...thanks.
Walter.
- Walter, we're going to be married.
- Are you surprised?
Gee, whiz.
Well, where do we go on the honeymoon?
Dr. Foote, you can start using the parlor again.
Vernon, I'm scared.
Now, now, sweetheart, that's no way to talk.
I don't feel so rosy myself.
Maybe we're not quite ready yet.
Maybe we should rehearse some more.
And come back next week, huh?
- Yes, that's it.
- Come on Walter.
What are you doing, running away?
We thought we'd go home, rehearse more and come back next week.
Next week? Now look, you've been practicing for months...
...and you know everything fine. Why, you did it for me last night. It was beautiful.
Come right back here and sit down.
When Mr. Fields tells you...
...keep your chin up, your chest out and put your best foot forward.
Hello, Vernon.
Hello, Mrs. Castle.
How are the newlyweds?
Well, Vernon, what do you wanna show me, a bride-and-groom skit?
Mr. Fields, it's a...
...it's a sort of a dance.
- It is a dance.
Since when have you had dancing ambitions?
- Since he met me.
- Oh. Well, all right, let's look at it.
- Thanks.
- Charlie, put on the front border.
You sit here.
- I hope I don't disappoint you.
- Come on. You know...
...chin up, chest out and best foot forward.
All right, Walter.
Very nice.
No?
Why not?
Well, now, who's gonna pay money to see a man dance with his wife?
Look, I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll give Mrs. Castle a line in the show, and as for you, Vernon...
...next season I'll hand you a whole new scene.
- That will be...
- Mr. Fields, what kind of a scene?
Well, I'll tell you.
The idea is that I'm a bricklayer.
- Oh, and I'm your helper.
- Yes.
- You come on with a hat full of bricks.
- And you trip me up.
No, I shove you right in the cement.
- And I'm covered with it.
- You clumsy geek, pick up those bricks.
Oh, I see.
See, he is the one, Papa.
The droll one.
Oh, so droll in the barbershop.
Right back into the cement.
What's the matter?
- I'm sorry, sir, I can't do it.
- What?
Why not?
We're going to dance together.
- Say, whose idea is this?
- Ours.
Well, you know Vernon, as a comedian you're valuable to me.
But as a dancer... Even two dancers.
- You wouldn't bring in two nickels.
We're sorry, Mr. Fields, but we think you're wrong.
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe you're wrong.
Now, don't take it too badly, Mrs. Castle.
We all make mistakes.
See you later, Vernon.
Greenhorn.
Do you think it's true, what he said?
We can try some other managers.
We want to dance and we're going to.
I wish I knew where.
- Mr. Castle.
- Mr. Castle.
- Mr. Castle.
- Yes.
- I'm Mr. Aubel and this is Emile, my son.
- Oh, how do you do?
My father and I purchased from Mr. Fields the French rights to The Hen Pecks.
And we reproduce the play in the Paris next spring.
And we want you for our show.
You want...
Oh, Vernon, darling.
A honeymoon in Paris and we get paid for it.
- You come?
- Sure, we'll come.
Oh, Walter, I don't know about you.
Walter, goes with us if it takes our last cent.
Sure.
You think I'll let you two go alone?
Gee, whiz.
Wait a minute, there's the theater.
- There's the theater.
- Hold it.
Turn around. Tell him to turn around.
Back there.
No, no.
Have him wait, Walter.
- No, that's too expensive.
- Whatever, our salary starts any minute.
Hello, Mr. Aubel.
How do you do?
Here we are.
I believe you telephoned our secretary.
Oui, Oui...
I am very sorry...
...but it is so.
- What?
But you told him we were late.
Emile?
No, no. We are late.
Nous, not vous.
- The play is late.
- Au revoir...
...we see you in six weeks.
Vernon, what are we going to do in the meantime? We haven't any money.
- Wait a minute. Monsieur...
- No, no, let me.
I'm used to this. It's very simple.
Mr. Aubel, could we trouble you for the usual advance on our salary?
You don't understand. I mean, we're a little short of cash.
Mr. Aubel.
Please.
For you, madam.
Emile.
You will please sign... A formality.
Wait, this is for eight days' salary instead of seven.
Interest, you know?
- Like a bank.
- Oh, yes.
- What, is this customary?
- I guess so.
Our country seems so strange to you.
You must not bother about business.
- You are young, and it is Paris, it is spring...
- Papa.
Au revoir, madame.
Zowie, you bad dog. We're so sorry.
I wait.
From now on, we walk.
- Pay him, Walter.
- Take Zowie to that fancy hotel and pack.
We're going to look for a flat.
Bye.
What?
To you.
Well, we got our health, we're young...
...we're in Paris, we're on our honeymoon...
...what more do we want?
- Nothing.
Oh, look.
- Isn't that a darling Dutch cap?
- Well, we can afford that.
Oh, no.
No, we can't.
- But you want it.
- I told you, I don't want anything but you.
- Mr. Castle.
- Come on, let's hurry.
- Hurry up, hurry up.
- Come on, Zow, come on.
Hurry up, Zowie.
Come on, Zowie.
- Oh, did you hurt yourself?
- Zowie.
Hurry up, hurry up.
- I hope I got the key.
- Get in here, Zowie. Hurry up.
That's it, hurry up.
Mr. Castle.
Where is my money?
For eight weeks you have not paid.
- Where is my money?
- Quiet, if you please.
Quiet, quiet, quiet.
Must we be subjected to all this brawling?
Pardon, madame.
Let me explain.
But those young people...
I am hoarse from screaming for my rent.
You will have to scream for his rent, too, if you don't mind your manners.
I've brought him a client...
...who can't stand noise.
- Maggie.
Quiet.
Such a quaint place, isn't it?
Veritable bit of Bohemia.
Really, Maggie, these obscure geniuses of yours.
- I don't know if they're worth it or not.
- I'm sure this one is.
Of course you're sure.
You get 10 percent of what I pay him.
My nerves are on edge.
- Can't you work faster?
- Faster? Faster...
Maggie, I can't stand it.
Lady Bolton, please, please.
You take your time.
Look.
- Madam, the pose.
- You expect me to pose...
...when we all may be killed at any instant?
I don't care if he is a genius.
Either this bedlam ceases, or I leave.
Stop it.
Stop it up there.
All right.
We heard you.
Well, at least we can eat.
I'm gonna move out of this place.
- Eat what?
- Oh, what have we here?
Would you carve?
- I'm not hungry.
- Oh, Vernon.
Why don't we get a call from the Aubels?
Why don't they start?
- Maybe we're not in the show.
- You know we are.
Oh, Vernon, you're the optimist. You're the one that always sees the bright side.
Bright side?
Look.
- Darling, that's all that's left.
- Walter.
Quiet. Quiet.
They've started rehearsals for the show.
- Started rehearsals?
- That's what it says.
- Repetition commences.
- Why didn't Mr. Aubel let us know?
What's the difference? The show starts, our salary starts. Come on.
- Walter, where are my dancing shoes?
- In the trunk.
- Oh, no, they're on your feet.
- Oh. Come on, let's go.
Oh, wait a minute.
I can't go until I press my suit.
- You and Walter go, I'll meet you there.
- All right. Hurry.
Hello, Mr. Aubel.
Ah, Monsieur Castle.
Why didn't you tell us rehearsals started?
Did you think we didn't need any?
- But you knew what you have to do.
- Come.
There she is.
- Oh, but you hired us to dance.
- Dance?
No, no, no.
We have the dance.
- Oh, you will be a knockout, Mr. Castle.
- All Paris will laugh.
You are a very funny man.
The whole French nation
You will hear them saying
A real sensation and the people
Will stay till the break of the day
While we are dancing
Well...
...what happened?
False alarm.
Hello, Zowie.
I got myself all pressed up.
You look nice too.
Don't she, Vernon?
Yeah.
What happened?
Well...
Here's a present for you.
Oh, my little Dutch cap.
We didn't have money to buy this.
We haven't now.
Darling, they didn't hire us to dance.
They just want me for the barbershop scene I did with Fields.
I won't do it, Irene.
I told them I wouldn't.
But then they brought up the money we owe them.
Vernon, would they let you dance alone...
...because if they would...
Do you think I'd wanna dance without you?
I should have let you keep on doing what you were doing.
It's all my fault.
No, it isn't.
Look, darling, we're all right now.
After all, you have got a job.
May not be the job we wanted, but still it's a job.
Maybe later on...
...we get a chance...
...sometime.
Maybe sometime.
Hey.
Dance with me.
All the people downstairs...
Look.
We can do it quietly, like this:
Just as if we're walking on air.
Funny, and we're down to earth for the first time.
- What do you suppose they're doing?
- And you call me nervous.
I'm not nervous, I'm simply curious.
That's nice.
Take a good look, Walter.
This is our farewell appearance.
Get me a chair.
I said get me a chair.
What do you call that...?
That... what you were doing.
Oh. Well, l... I don't know, I guess you might call it the Castle Walk.
- Castle Walk?
- Castle, that's our name.
I'm Vernon Castle, and this is my wife.
My name's Walter.
I'm Maggie Sutton.
Oh. Maggie Sutton, of course.
How would you like to try out for a dancing job?
- What?
- Where?
At the Cafe de Paris.
Cafe de Paris? Irene.
- You know the manager?
- My dear, the manager knows me.
- Darling, we got a job.
- Ah, just a tryout.
All I could guarantee would be your dinner.
Well, maybe you could arrange that for tonight... The dinner, I mean.
- And we could dance tomorrow night.
- Well, I think it might be arranged that way.
- Dinner at the Cafe de Paris.
- Dinner anyplace.
Dinner.
- Does this person dance too?
- No, but I eat.
Walter is our sort of manager.
He was your manager.
You mean you're an agent.
I'm an entrepreneuse...
...but I still expect my 10 percent.
That's some old crank downstairs.
Don't pay no attention.
I beg your pardon?
Everyone is staring at you.
Oh, dear, I hope not.
Because you look so beautiful.
Just like a bride.
I should in my wedding dress, my Dutch cap.
I hope it brings us luck.
I am honored by your presence,
Your Highness.
My dear Louis, thank
Miss Sutton. She is my guide to Paris.
And none better, Your Highness.
They look very respectable for dancers.
Dancers? Who dances?
You must come back tomorrow night,
Louis has a treat for you. Two Americans.
But tomorrow I'm leaving for St. Petersburg.
- Why do they not dance tonight?
- Well, I doubt if they're prepared.
How does one prepare for a dance?
One simply dances.
Have them dance.
I think it's going to be quite amusing.
American dancers.
- A little more caviar, please.
- Foie gras too.
And plenty of the truffles.
Such a rush all day,
I didn't even have time for tea.
I lunched at the club.
Food is very dull there.
- Can you dance now?
- Now, tonight?
I have a Grand Duke over there.
If he likes you, you're made.
- The orchestra.
- We haven't rehearsed with them.
Oh, they can play anything you want.
- But our dinner.
- No, no, no, dance first.
But if he doesn't like us, do we still get dinner?
If you feel like it.
Well, Vernon, we've nothing to lose.
Tell them to play,
"Too Much Mustard."
- Oh, Vernon, I've forgotten everything.
- No. Come on, dance with me.
I raised them.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. And Mrs. Castle...
...will dance again in one half-hour.
You know, it's funny I'm not a bit hungry now.
- Neither am I.
- You can't waste it.
Oh, magnifique.
From now on you dance here every night,
I pay you.
A tip from the Grand Duke.
A tip?
We can't possibly accept it.
- We're very grateful but...
- No, this is no time to be proud. We need it.
Irene, look what they're doing.
I think you've started something tonight,
Mr. And Mrs. Vernon Castle.
Isn't there anything in this country except the Castles?
This is getting to be the most...
Chicago, Chicago, that toddling town
Hello, Frisco, Hello
Way down yonder in New Orleans
Take me back to New York Town
When are you going to break the news to Maggie?
The moment she mentions another tour.
- You're going to have trouble with her.
- Is it Maggie's life, or ours?
- It's ours.
- It's time she found that out.
Very nice.
Well, children, I have some vulgar financial matters to take up with you.
Here are some ideas for your next tour.
There isn't going to be a tour for a while.
Oh, of course, I know you're tired.
So I've arranged to have a week's rest before you start out.
- What's this?
- Going out on the platform. She needs air.
Another mouth to feed.
That makes seven.
- Where and when did you buy that?
- In Baltimore.
Here's the bill.
Hello, Maggie.
Maggie? Very touching.
We'll be in New York in an hour.
It would help if you would sign this now.
Maggie, we want to buy a house in the country.
- All right, buy it.
- Yes, but we want to live in it.
All right, live in it.
She don't want air, she wants water.
Come on, Mag.
Listen, you two, you better make hay while the sun shines.
Maggie, we're in love.
We've made enough money.
- We want to live like simple, married people.
- In a house with our clothes in closets.
We're not going to sign any contracts.
We've got it planned.
We'll visit England.
And Vernon's going to show me where he was born and where he went to school...
Well, everything he knew before he met me.
I didn't know anything before I met you.
Seems to be a strong smell of honey-suckling roses in this car.
And you can't raise horses and dogs...
...and children on a dancing tour, you know that, Maggie.
Well, if I were your age and had your opportunities...
Don't try to talk us out of it. We're firm.
- Don't interrupt me. As I was about to say...
- It won't make a difference.
I was about to say...
...l'd want to do exactly what you're going to do.
Where are we?
Extra! Extra!
Here, boy. Boy.
Germany declares war,
England mobilizes.
"Thousands volunteer for British army."
I guess it won't amount to anything.
It says here that Europe can't afford a war.
It would probably be over in a week.
- Will you spend the night here?
- I should say not.
I find the country quiet very disturbing.
How would you like to be back in Paris?
I see by the papers they bombed it again.
Here comes Sailor.
- Hello, Maggie.
- Hello there.
- Have you told Vernon who was here yet?
- No, but I will.
How are you, Maggie, old girl.
Irene, you ready to come back to the outside world?
As far as we're concerned, there's nothing going on in the world.
There's a war going on.
- Don't talk that way in front of Vernon.
- Then it's on his mind?
No, not at all.
Women are pathetic when they try to fight something bigger than they are.
I'm not trying to fight anything.
Vernon's my life.
I'm his life.
Isn't that enough?
One girl against an army?
It isn't quite enough, Irene.
Come on, let's find Vernon.
- Vernon, Maggie's here.
- Oh, hello, Maggie.
- Vernon.
- What's the matter?
Oh, Vernon.
Oh, the uniform.
It's for the British benefit, Sunday night.
They've asked me to dance.
I told you.
Well, if this is your idea of a joke...
No. Oh, I'm sorry, darling.
I haven't enlisted. Some crazy fellow in the Publicity department sent this down.
I'm... I'm not going to wear it,
I just tried it on.
So you went and done it, huh?
- No, Walter...
- You told me if you enlisted, I could join up.
It isn't real. It's just a uniform for benefit.
It doesn't mean a thing.
- He's not even going to wear it.
- Of course not.
Come on, Walter. We'll send this back.
I'll dig out something else to wear.
Looks like a regular soldier, don't he?
Here's the afternoon paper.
- I don't dare read the newspapers anymore.
- Neither do I.
- Oh, Maggie, what am I going to do?
- Nothing.
War is a man's business.
Women only do what they're told.
It's a long way to Tipperary
It's a long way to go
It's a long way to Tipperary
To the sweetest girl I know
You're next, Mr. Castle. Two thousand people waiting to see you.
They didn't come to see me.
They came to see them.
It's a long, long way to Tipperary
But my heart's right there
Ready, Mr. Castle.
Mr. Castle?
Go on, darling.
Jeremiah Jones, a ladies' man was he
Any pretty girl could turn his head
But he got an awful fright
While strolling out one night
When someone winked at him and said:
There you are. Off you go.
Hello, hello
Who's your lady friend?
Who's the little girlie by your side?
I've seen you with a girl or two
Oh, oh, oh
I am surprised at you
Hello, hello
Stop your little games
Don't you think your ways
You ought to mend?
This isn't the girl I saw you with
At Brighton
Who, who, who's your lady?
Who, who, who's your lady?
Who, who, who's your lady friend?
This isn't the girl I saw you with
At Brighton
Who, who, who's your lady friend?
Take another bow, Mr. Castle?
No, Frank, let them take the bows.
Fine bunch of men.
Ladies and gentlemen, we want to thank all of the performers...
...who have willingly given their services to...
- Where's the recruiting officer?
- A man here wants to join up.
He's over there talking with Mr. Castle.
- To thank this splendid representative body of Canadian men.
- Frank, have you seen Mr. Castle?
- He went downstairs.
Oh, my.
Vernon.
Darling, I have enlisted in the Royal Flying Corps.
I had to, Irene.
Maybe if America were in the war, you'd understand how I feel, why I have to go.
I know.
It won't last long.
They say one more push, and it'll all be over.
That's not so bad, is it?
And I'll come back, and we'll settle down...
...and have the house again and everything.
Just as we were.
Yes, darling.
They may kick me out sooner than that.
I'll probably make a very bad soldier.
You'll make a very good soldier.
- Hey, look at your aileron, sir.
- Yeah, I know.
- How'd you get back?
- I had to get back.
- My furlough starts this afternoon.
- I'll say you earned it.
Telegram, Lieutenant Castle.
- Sailor's in Paris.
- What?
We'll be seeing her tonight, do you realize that?
We'll be seeing her. Come on.
- Castle.
- Yes, sir?
- You better see these plate holders.
- What's the matter with them?
- Busted the whole lot of them.
- I'm afraid so.
- That bullet had your name on it.
- It's a lucky thing this case was in the way.
- Well, we can get them tomorrow.
- But I start my leave this afternoon, sir.
I'm afraid it'll have to be postponed.
GHQ wants this sector covered.
- Can I go up right now?
- Without a convoy?
Yes, sir, I can use Morgan's plane.
- Well, go ahead. Good luck.
- Thanks.
- Hey, Flight, stand by that plane.
- Yes, sir.
- Why don't you get going?
- Where?
Paris. Tell Irene
I'll meet her at Louis' at 8:00.
- Contact.
- Contact.
Tell her to save the first dance for me.
Well, don't just sit there, talk.
- There ain't much news where I come from.
- Then make some up.
Well, we lost a couple of planes this morning, but...
- but they lost more.
I guess that ain't very interesting.
Did you tell Walter about your offer to go to California to make moving pictures?
No, is that so?
- Maggie, why doesn't he come?
- Now, now, he's all right.
Back home, I used to think,
"Oh, if I could only be over there with him."
And now I'm here, and...
...he's not.
Ladies and gentlemen, a few years ago,
I introduced for the first time...
...someone who is now most famous.
She has come back to dance for us again tonight.
Mrs. Vernon Castle.
Ladies and gentlemen, l... l...
Oh, Vernon.
It's quarter to 5.
It's almost daylight.
Oh, Vernon, how long do you think it will go on?
I don't know. Nobody seems to know.
Is it terribly dangerous in those planes?
I mean, worse than in the trenches?
Darling, we said we wouldn't talk about it tonight.
I know, but it's almost morning, and you'll be going back...
...and I won't see you for a long time.
I shouldn't worry, it's foolish.
I'm not the only soldier's wife,
I know that.
You will be careful, won't you?
I'll be careful.
And what's more I think
I'm going to be lucky.
- Lucky?
- Yes.
They say there's one bullet with your name on it.
If it misses you, you come out all right.
Well, I think my bullet missed me yesterday.
Darling.
And from now on,
I'm gonna be all right.
It's a good idea to hang on to.
I'll hang on to it.
You think of everything, don't you?
You thought of coming here instead of the Ritz...
...or some place that might not feel quite like home.
What's that?
Oh, Vernon, maybe the war is over.
What's happened?
The Americans have come into the war.
- America.
- Hooray.
- You know what that means.
- The war is practically over.
Yeah.
Get out, this is the picture.
- Now, camera, action.
- We're ready, Mrs. Castle.
All right, Mrs. Castle.
All right, Mr. D'Arcy.
Now, let's make this bigger than the war.
Ready... camera... action!
That's it, Mrs. Castle, closer.
Mrs. Castle, closer...
- Bigger eyes, Mrs. Castle.
- Irene, telephone.
Can't you see we're shooting?
Irene, Vernon's on the telephone.
He's in Canada.
Oh, Vernon. Oh, excuse me.
Cut!
Cut!
Cut.
Hello? Hello!
Darling, I just landed in Canada.
Yeah, but I'm being transferred next week to Fort Worth, Texas.
Fort Worth, Texas?
Well, that's practically here.
I know. I'm to be a flying instructor for the American Army.
Hello, Sailor, how are you?
- Tell her who it is.
- That was Walter.
Can you meet me there next weekend?
- Next weekend? Oh, I can't wait.
- Me too.
Yes, darling.
Now, I want a room where we can have dinner and absolute privacy.
You just leave it to me, captain.
This ain't so much.
- Nice set up, huh. Cozy?
- Yes, this will do.
I know the ladies, they like things nice.
- Say, who do you think is gonna be...?
- Walter.
- My friend here is a bit strait-laced.
- Sure, I know the type. Reformer.
Well, he's in the army now, eh, captain?
Can you close off that garden?
- You'll be as snug as a bug in a rug here.
- I want to reserve the garden too.
But that's for special occasions.
Our orchestra plays there.
- I want the orchestra.
- Oh, atmosphere, huh?
- No, music, you dumb...
- Walter...
...try to be a little more sophisticated, like the gentleman here.
Oh, here he is, in here.
Captain, you are to report back to the field immediately.
Not me, I've got weekend leave.
I'm sorry, captain.
I know you just got here...
...but a brigadier general blew in.
They want all pilots in the air this afternoon.
Thank you, lieutenant.
Well, it looks as if
I have to leave it all to you.
I know what you want. A hot bird, a cold bottle and a warm shoulder, eh, captain?
Look, here's the list of the music
I want the orchestra to play.
Take care of it and explain to the lady
I may be late.
- Sure will. What name will she give?
- It's his wife.
- Your wife?
- Yes, do you mind?
No, I don't mind, but I don't understand it.
All right, Castle.
Only one more hour.
Hey, young fellow, sit in the back.
But the officer just told me that student pilots...
- I know, I like to ride in front.
- Yes, sir.
Why won't Captain Castle ever ride in the back seat?
Nobody can make him since that crash in Canada...
...when the boy in front got killed.
- Gas on, switch off.
- Contact.
- Contact.
Here we are.
Nice, huh? Best suite in the house.
You're across the hall, Miss Sutton.
Did Captain Castle say how long he'd be at the field?
No ma'am, but he arranged for dinner at 7:30 in the private dining room.
- Sounds almost wicked.
- We cater only to a family trade, ma'am.
- I beg your pardon.
- Not at all. My card.
If we can ever be of any service to you, call on me.
- A wife-beater if ever I saw one.
- Maggie, won't you have dinner with us?
- We'd love to have you.
- Liar. You'd better get dressed.
Here comes Castle's squadron now.
Colonel, look out there.
Don't let that fool take off.
Flag him down.
Walter.
Oh, it's wonderful to see you.
- Hello, Sailor.
- Where's Vernon?
Oh, so that's it.
Vernon?
We wait months to see each other, now you play games.
Vernon.
Where is he?
What's happened?
Sailor, Vernon's...
He's hurt.
Well, where is he? I've got to...
No.
He had his choice of hitting another plane or crashing his own.
The student with him wasn't hurt much.
But Vernon was in the front seat.
He was a hero, Sailor.
Oh, Vernon.
They'll remember what he did this afternoon.
They'll remember a lot of things he did.
The way he laughed and the way he danced.
The way he made other people want to dance.
Walter, he was just beginning to live.
He'll go on living. For you, and me.
Maybe even for a lot of people that never knew him.
There's got to be something in him in every boy and girl that get up and dance together.
They were singing that the day I met him out in the water, with Zowie.
- I'd better get down and tell them to stop.
- No.
He wanted them tonight.
That was at the train, the first time he kissed me.
Don't, Sailor.
Don't you want to go to your room now?
Go tell Maggie.
Hey, Halphen... Going to Epernay?
- When?
- In half an hour.
In your truck?... Give me a ride.
- Sure... Josephine?
- Of course!
- You're not the only one.
- Big deal!
Say, Maréchal...
You have to take up a staff officer.
He's picked the wrong time.
- Josephine again?
- Yeah, Josephine.
Where will all that get you?
She'll just have to wait.
Liquor kills!
Liquor drives you crazy!
The squadron leader drinks it!
Captain de Boeldieu.
Staff officer, division...
Do you know this photo, Mr. Maréchal?
Sure. Ricord took it with me.
And where can I find Mr. Ricord?
- On leave.
- Of course.
This gray smudge worries me...
Here, just below the road.
- That's not a road, it's a canal.
- No, a railway.
Such unanimity honors our aerial cameras.
It was a foggy day.
I'd like to resolve this enigma.
I'll request a plane.
I'll go get ready, sir.
Flying suit or fur jacket?
No preference.
Flying suits smell, fur jackets shed.
Get me the fighter squadron.
Take a car to the sugar refinery.
I just shot down a Caudron fiighter.
If they're Officers, invite them for lunch.
Freisler... make us one of your famous fruit punches to celebrate the downing of my twelfth plane.
Three bottles of Moselle... two Rhine... half a bottle of Martel... three bubbly... two seltzer... pineapples...
Two officers. One is wounded.
I took him to the infirmary.
Captain von Rauffenstein,
CO, 21 st Squadron.
Captain de Boeldieu, staff officer.
Lt. Maréchal, pilot.
My apologies.
My officers.
I am honored to have French guests.
Now, gentlemen, let us eat.
Orderly, coats!
Freisler, your punch...
May I serve you?
I knew a Boeldieu in Berlin... a Count de Boeldieu.
My cousin, Edmond de Boeldieu.
He was military attaché.
He's a fighter pilot now.
Aren't you eating?
I can't cut the meat.
- May I?
- Please do.
You speak good French.
I was a mechanic in Lyons.
No kidding!
Me too, I'm a mecha...
To Captain de Crussol,
French Flying Corps, shotdown in flames...
From the Officers ofthe German 21st Squadron.
I'm sorry about this coincidence.
May the earth lie lightly on our valiant enemy.
I have orders to take custody of the captured officers.
PRISONER-OF-WAR CAMP N17
OFFICERS' CAMP
Read these gentlemen the camp regulations.
"Officers will be treated with the consideration due their rank. "
"However, you are reminded that you are subject to German law. "
"You therefore must obey the rules of German discipline. "
"Any German soldier here has the right to give you orders which must be obeyed without protest. "
"You must salute Officers according to German army regulations. "
"If you attempt to escape, sentries have orders to fire on officers found outside camp limits. "
"Incorrect dress is not permitted. "
" Large crowds are forbidden.
You may not insult the German people,
"or write or speak to civilians from outside the camp. "
"It is forbidden to speak to the sentries. "
Gentlemen, we will now proceed with some minor formalities.
Russian nouns are declined just like in Latin.
- Newcomers.
- Let's warn them.
Angel of purity, angel of light!
Hide your valuables...
- What are they singing?
- To hide our valuables.
Don't touch!
Those belong to me.
I've got nothing, old man.
Had I known,
I'd have brought some cash.
This conduct is unbecoming.
Sorry, it's our duty to search you.
This is war.
I perfectly agree, but conduct it courteously.
If not, I'll see your commanding officer.
How are you - kulele?
Lucky you - calyptus!
Here, Müller, have some chocolate.
You've no right to open my ham!
It's in the regulations.
I read them carefully.
It's rotten! You can have it!
He's hard to please.
I'm delighted when my folks send a parcel.
Here we are, in the heart of Germany, cut off from our families by the front, and here's a can of peas, direct from Paris.
Is it all right?
I'm amazed at how honest our jailers are with our parcels.
It's true!
Take our feldwebel, Arthur...
He eats cabbage every day.
It sticks in his craw. He told me so.
He'd much rather lay into your peas.
Don't kid yourselves.
If they did that, our parcels would stop coming.
They're short of food for themselves.
Hurry, our guests will be hungry.
This tastes like an old sock!
What do they feed the French?
Cabbage, but they have their parcels.
- And the Russians?
- Cabbage roots, but no parcels.
And the English?
I was on the stage before the war... in vaudeville.
- Ever see me?
- Theater's too deep for me.
I prefer bicycling.
You follow the Tour de France?
You must've heard of Fabert,
Garrigoud, Petit Breton...
Can we purchase what we like?
Yes, through the canteen.
Fine, I'll buy myself a comfortable armchair... playing cards, a few books,
English cigarettes.
You won't fiind those.
There you go, sir.
I'll come again tomorrow.
Gentlemen, time to eat.
Sir...
So, gentlemen, what shall we begin with?
Chicken, foie gras, or Captain Cook mackerel?
You're well provisioned.
Don't they feed us here?
In theory, they do, but what they give us is inedible.
Fortunately, we have our parcels, especially our friend Rosenthal's.
Oh, please!
A cognac to start with, sir?
I've never eaten so well in my life.
Some fish?
I'm getting used to
Rosenthal's kindness.
Man is such an adaptable creature.
You can see he's a professor...
Profess her... Confess her...
Address her... undress her...
Oops, a slip!
You're quite a joker!
Is that supposed to be witty?
He's hard to please!
Let's drink to peace!
Not bad, this cognac.
Comes from Fouquet's in mouthwash bottles.
Fouquet's?
It's a bar on the Champs-Elysées.
When I went to Paris, I ate at my brother-in-law's. It's cheaper.
- Been to Paris lately?
- Last week.
Lucky man! Places crowded?
Maxim's was packed.
I never go to places like that...
I prefer a nice little bar... with good wine.
- Maxim's... don't know it either.
- It's no great loss.
We know you eat at your brother-in-law's...
He never lets up!
Is he there, "Mr. Monocle"?
No, he's not.
I've just been to the canteen.
It's about his armchair request...
Let him tighten his belt!
I'll tell him.
He's nice, the guy with the parcels.
Well off?
And how!
You know the Rosenthal bank?
His parents.
Am I tickling you?
- And what's he do?
- Runs a big fashion house.
Funny.
With his money, I wouldn't...
What do you do in civilian life?
I'm a engineer for the cadaster.
Sure, the cadaster... just between us... can we trust your pal, the Captain?
He may seem strange, but he's okay.
You can trust him all right.
- It's all right, then.
- Why?
You see, after dark... we're digging a tunnel.
What for?
To escape.
What do you dig with?
A coal shovel, old food cans...
I calculate we should come up in a garden behind those buildings there.
It's open country.
That's slow work.
We've been at it for two months. just a few more weeks...
The war'll be over fiirst.
You're deluding yourself.
Think so?
Best to be prepared.
Where's the tunnel?
You'll see tonight, after roll call.
So you're digging a hole...
Like Monte Cristo. What a laugh!
- Thanks for the wash.
- You can't do it with your arm.
Mind if I ask you something?
Go ahead.
What's a "cadaster"?
- Maréchal.
- Present.
- Boeldieu.
- Captain de Boeldieu.
- Cartier.
- Here... we go again!
Good night, Arthur!
- Whose turn is it?
- Cartier's.
What's that for?
For breathing.
These are to extend the line.
And the bags?
For removing earth.
This is the alarm.
If I start to suffocate,
I yank on the string...
The can falls...
And the boys pull me out by the feet...
The feet...
What are you waiting for?
Watch me play the mole... mol-asses!
Is the tunnel safe?
It's shored up with wood from the theater.
And the earth?
Stuffed under the floorboards.
But there's not an inch of space left.
Now we fiill bags and empty them during exercise.
Hear that?
I'm sure I heard something.
It's nothing.
Listen...
We'll send someone out to check.
You've got an innocent face.
Go take a peek outside.
I'll pretend to go to the latrine.
Say, Arthur, what happened?
The fellow tried to escape.
We caught him in the garden behind those buildings...
We opened fire.
Behind the buildings?
- Is he dead?
- I think so.
And you, what are you doing out?
Going to the latrine.
- What was it?
- Someone tried to escape.
He got as far as the garden behind the buildings.
A sentry shot him.
He's dead.
The alarm!
- No answer.
- Pull him out.
Hurt bad?
Drink some cognac.
From Fouquet's.
Here's mud in your eye.
Don't drop the bottle.
Who goes down tomorrow?
You do, sir... if you don't mind.
My pleasure. I understand crawling is fine exercise.
I remind you it is strictly forbidden to receive non-military clothing.
Good news?
It's from my aunt in Bordeaux.
People are swarming into town.
What do you think?
They'd better watch out, the Germans are claiming a major breakthrough.
There's been no bell-ringing so it can't mean much.
Up for some gardening?
I hate the way
German bulletins exaggerate.
And our papers don't?
Remember the "Russian steamroller"?
Isn't it time we got down to serious business?
Sure, but not all at once.
And that famous General "Winter," so lethal to the nasty Krauts but so tonic to the Allies...
And do you remember "Turpinite"?
A flask the size of... a radish that could blow up a whole battalion.
They even tried it on a flock of sheep.
Too bad they didn't stop at that.
- What're you guys planting?
- Dandelions.
I'm dreaming of dandelion salad.
The war'll be over before your dandelions grow.
This singular exercise will give us workman's hands.
The trunks are here!
- The costumes?
- At the theater.
There should be a trunk with women's clothes.
Coming, sir?
My theatrical skills are questionable.
Besides, I'm engaged.
- Playing patience?
- Exactly. I'm a realist.
Find anything, Arthur?
Nothing.
Well, gentlemen, enjoy yourselves.
Where will we put all this?
I asked for hangers.
Be careful...
These things should be handled with care... with your eyes closed.
Looks like a little girl's dress.
Dresses are short now. just below the knee.
So I hear. I'd love to see that!
Then put it on.
Not him, he never shaves.
- You have an angel face, Maisonneuve.
- Anything to amuse.
We have to take inventory.
The corset, too!
Take it easy.
It's not only the dresses.
They wear their hair short, too.
Short hair!
It's like sleeping with a boy!
When we're not around, women act foolish.
I'm sure my wife hasn't cut her hair.
That's for high-class floozies.
How would you know, with that mug?
- Shoes!
- How small they are!
Stockings.
Stockings of sheerest silk!
Hey, fellas, I'm ready!
Let us dream a bit first.
You'll only stifle our imagination.
Look at that!
Black stockings!
Looks like a real girl!
Funny, huh?
Doesn't it look funny?
Yeah, sure looks funny.
Poor boys.
Enjoy yourselves.
Out there, children play soldier...
In here, soldiers play like children.
I wish I knew what's going on back home.
- No news?
- Nothing.
I don't care what my missus is up to.
I want out
'cause I'm bored stiff... bored!
So you want to escape for the fun ofit.
Right!
For me, it's the spirit of contradiction.
They won't let me fiight, so I'm dying to.
I hate being here when others are biting the dust.
For me it's simple.
A golf course is for golf.
A tennis court for tennis.
A prison camp is for escaping.
And you, Rosenthal, the sportsman...
Him? He was born in Jerusalem.
No, in Vienna. To a Danish mother and a Polish father, naturalized French.
Old Celtic aristocracy!
Yet for all your French roots, none of you owns an acre ofyour country.
In 35 years, the Rosenthals have acquired three chateaux with hunting preserves, farms, orchards, warrens, stud farms, and 3 galleries of bona fiide ancestors.
If that's not worth escaping to fight for!
I'd never considered patriotism from such an unusual angle.
With all those game preserves, your lackeys must really stuff themselves.
I got into the war in a funny way.
I became a soldier because I'm a vegetarian.
That's right.
My brother and I had stomach ailments.
The doctor warned us against eating meat.
I turned vegetarian and got well.
My brother went on eating meat, got sick and was invalided out.
Your citations show vegetarianism didn't interfere with duty.
Or stop my wife from cheating on me.
You have to admit it's stirring.
I loathe fifes.
Still, it gets to you.
It's not the music that gets to you...
It's the marching feet.
Thanks to your dumb talk
I ruined my pants...
FORT DOUAUMONT TAKEN!
What about our show?
Do we still put it on?
You bet we do!
All the more reason.
In fact we should invite the German Officers.
Although I won't join in your artistic endeavors, Maréchal, let me congratulateyou...
That's the spirit!
Have you met Marguerite
She's neither tall nor petite
With eyes that glow, skin like snow
And lips in a cupid's bow
Well, when this divine creation
Heard my ardent declaration
She gave me a rose, tweaked my nose
Saying, "I'll give you joy"
I said, "Thanks all the same
But that's not why I came"
If you want to give me joy
Marguerite, Marguerite
If you want to give me joy
Make me your loverboy
'Neath her window I waited
And then I serenaded::
"My soul's apyre since your eyes set my heart on fire!"
So this sweet and caring dame
To put out my raging flame
Did a bucket spill from her sill
Asking, "Is it burning still?"
I said, "Thanks all the same
But that's not why I came"
If you want to give me joy
Marguerite, let me be your loverboy
All together now!
And now... direct from Paris!
Get it, Arthur?
Stop the show! Stop the show!
Stop, fellas!
We've retaken Douaumont!
It's in the German papers.
A little hole, to escape.
GERMAN TROOPS
RECAPTURE DOUAUMONT
Isn't that awful?
Can't be much left of it!
Get off my back!
I can't take it any more! I'm fed up!
I want to see some light!
It stinks of shit in here!
Hear me? It stinks of shit!
And I want to hear a voice.
I want to hear a French voice.
What was he yelling about?
The war's too long.
If my calculations are right, we should be under the garden wall in four days.
That's a lot of dirt!
Now that we may get away and reach home again,
I'm afraid of what's waiting for me.
There's more than one woman on earth!
Not for me.
That's why she cheats on you.
One thing upsets me: leaving Maréchal behind.
It weighs on me as well.
In fact... it disturbs me.
But that's war. No room for sentiment.
Glad to seeyou, old man.
We are, too.
Wait until you hear why.
You old dog!
Got anything to eat? I'm hungry.
Have a seat.
Rosenthal's getting some grub ready.
What time is it?
11 o'clock.
Time's dragging today.
Sure, but tonight it's aufwiedersehen!
So, we meet in Amsterdam?
I'm keen to see Holland, for the tulips.
What about the cheese?
Don'tyou like Dutch cheese?
Sure, but they say the tulip fiields stretch for miles.
You have the instincts of a shop girl.
Assembly at three o'clock.
All Officers are to change camps.
Get your things ready.
Gentlemen,
I wish you a pleasant journey.
I hope you will see your wives again soon.
We ought to alert them.
About the tunnel.
Sir, there's a tunnel in Barrack 7.
Open the window.
It stinks in here!
Sir, may I point out there are only two pairs of white gloves left.
We can't get any gloves here.
Try to make them last.
Yes, sir... More coffee, sir?
If you call this muck coffee,
I have to accept it.
At least it warms my insides.
The list of new prisoners, sir.
Three new officer POWs reporting, sir!
Delighted to see you again, Boeldieu.
But I'm sorry to see you here.
We feel the same.
Sit down, gentlemen.
No, thank you, sir.
As you wish.
Captain de Boeldieu, four escape attempts:
Through a heating duct, in a garbage bin, via the sewers, in a laundry basket.
One must lower oneself, at times.
I understand.
Lieutenant Maréchal, five attempts at escape:
Disguised as a chimney sweep...
Correction, sir: heating engineer.
Disguised as a German soldier, disguised as a woman.
Amusing, very amusing.
But less so when an NCO tried to pick me up. That I didn't like!
Indeed?
I assure you.
Lieutenant Demolder, three attempts...
Gentlemen, I respect your patriotism and courage.
But the situation is completely different here.
No one escapes from this fortress.
You understand me, don't you?
So as not to be accused of German barbarism,
I have decided to apply
French regulations.
Look them over.
They make good bedtime reading.
And now, gentlemen, if you will follow me...
Oswald! My coat.
My soldiers aren't young, but they enjoy playing soldier.
We have 25 more guns like this one.
I suppose you know the Maxim gun?
Very well, sir.
But I prefer the restaurant.
Touché!
12th century.
Excuse me, sir...
Was this villa built specially for Captain de Boeldieu and myself?
Are we your only boarders?
Your comrades are back there.
13th century.
A 120-foot drop.
So kind of you to show us around the grounds.
It's such a nice castle, sir.
It's so old...
And so cheerful.
Sorry I can't give you a room to yourself.
I'm touched, but I'd never have accepted.
I hope our walk didn't weary you too much.
Not at all, sir, we're fiine.
- 14th century.
- Pure Gothic.
Ifyou don't mind, gentlemen...
Your friend Lt. Rosenthal, from the Hallbach camp, is here.
- Not old Rosenthal!
- He wasn't any luckier.
The commandant has put you all in the same room.
That way you'll eat better.
That's very nice of him.
A mere formality.
- I caught it with a brunette.
- Who can you trust?
A friend of my mother's.
Quite respectable. She did charity work.
In good society it's usually the pox.
Right, Boeldieu?
The pox used to be our privilege.
But we've lost it.
Like so many others.
Everything is popularized.
Cancer and gout aren't working-class diseases, but they will be, believe me.
How about intellectuals?
With us it's tuberculosis.
Here's Mr. Pindar.
And the middle class?
Liver and intestinal ailments...
They eat too much.
We'd each die ofour own class diseases, if war didn't make all germs equal.
Your dictionaries are in myway.
Excuse me, but Pindar has always been so badly translated.
A lamentable oversight.
I'm so sorry.
Not that I care, but who's this guy Pindar?
Go on,joke! But Pindar means more to me than anything...
More than you, the war, my life!
Pindar is the greatest Greek poet.
The greatest Greek poet?
You don't say...
There! My map'sjust about finished.
See... this is where we are...
16 miles above this bend in the Main River.
To reach Switzerland above Lake Constance and avoid the Rhine, we'd have to travel...
- 200 miles.
- No kidding!
That means walking 15 nights on 6 lumps of sugar and 2 biscuits a day.
You and your map, you're as crazy as him and his Pindar. To escape...
There! My picture's finished.
"Justice Pursuing Crime. "
It came out all right.
Look, to reach this Constance place...
Will it hold?
It can hold 10 of you and 5 like me.
They're searching the rooms!
- Under the mattress, quick!
- No, under mine!
That won't do.
It's childish.
May I?
Now there's an idea!
A convenient little gutter.
Here they are!
Gentlemen... inspection.
"Louise wrote to Victor:
I am as weary as a girl after 22 nights oflove. "
22 nights oflove, imagine that!
Continue!
Not that corner!
Give me your word that you've nothing in here against regulations.
You have my word.
But why my word and not theirs?
The word of a...
Rosenthal... and a Maréchal?
It's as good as ours.
Perhaps.
No, not that!
It's very rare.
Poor old Pindar!
They really are stupid.
Everything go all right in here?
- Not bad.
- For us, too.
And how is your cousin,
Edmond de Boeldieu, the military attaché I met in Berlin?
He's doing well. He's very happy.
He lost an arm and married a rich woman.
A truly fine career.
Recognize her?
Sit down.
Let me tell you something...
Believe me, my present functions revolt me as much as they do you.
That's being harsh.
I used to be a combatant.
Now I'm a bureaucrat, a policeman.
But it's the only way
I can still appear to be serving my fatherland.
I have burns all over...
That explains my gloves.
My spine is fractured in two places.
A silver plate.
In my kneecap, too.
I owe these riches to the misfortunes ofwar.
- May I ask you a question?
- Of course.
Why did you make an exception ofme by inviting me here?
Because your name is Boeldieu, career offiicer in the French Army.
And I am Rauffenstein, career offiicer in the German Imperial Army.
But my comrades are Officers, as well.
A Maréchal and a Rosenthal, Officers?
They're fine soldiers.
Charming legacy of the French Revolution.
Neither you nor I can stop the march of time.
Boeldieu...
I don't know who will win this war, but whatever the outcome, it will mean the end of the Rauffensteins and the Boeldieus.
We're no longer needed.
Isn't that a pity?
Perhaps.
I admire the way you tend your geranium.
Don't think I've become a botanist, but it's the only flower in the fortress.
Nothing grows here but ivy and nettles.
I'm glad I'm leaving with you.
With us.
Sure, I like Boeldieu, but...
With him...
I never really feel at ease.
Different backgrounds...
There's a wall between us.
He's a terrifiic guy.
Sure, and he's on the level, but...
Suppose you and I were on the skids.
We'd just be two bums.
If it happened to him, he'd still be " Monsieur de Boeldieu. "
Anyway, you've been terrifiic, too, feeding us with your parcels.
That's all vanity.
I'm really proud to come from a rich family.
Inviting you to my table is myway ofshowing it.
Most people think we're stingy.
Wrong. We're often generous.
Unfortunately, along with that quality,
Jehovah gave us an overdose of pride.
To hell with Jehovah!
All I know is you've been a real pal.
We've received a large crate, a gift from our Czarina.
Please come and share it with us.
From the Czarina? Must be caviar.
- Coming, Boeldieu? They've got vodka.
- Vodka? Lead on.
Now we can pay you back for all your kindness.
The Czarina is always good-hearted.
Quite a lady, your Czarina.
Think of what's in store!
"Principles ofAlgebra"...
"Elementary Ethics"... "Grammar"...
A cook book!
Something to sink your teeth into!
What a farce!
Let's go before something happens.
Goodbye, thanks anyway.
- The Cossacks aren't happy!
- Let's get out of here!
You have no right to burn books!
It's crazy sending us books!
The sentries are busy with the Russians.
It's a long drop here, but it's unguarded.
If only we'd been ready!
What a chance!
- Especially at night!
- We'll try again.
It was kind ofthem to hold a rehearsal for us.
Now we know if one man can divert them for 5 minutes, his comrades can escape.
- Too risky!
- You're exaggerating.
It would amuse me.
When do you want to go?
Why us? You're in it, too.
Why not? Don't you trust us?
- That wouldn't stop me.
- Well then?
A plan like yours can only work with two men.
And I know your preference.
- It's not fair.
- What's fair in war?
We can't accept that.
I'm not asking you...
I'm telling you.
The arts aren't forbidden here.
You like music?
So-so... I like a good waltz.
I love the flute.
Here's the program:
We buy flutes for everyone.
On the given day: concert in all the rooms at 5 p. m.
That's when night falls.
Five minutes later, they confiiscate our flutes.
At 5:15, another concert with anything at hand: saucepans, animal noises, grinding teeth, whatever...
Result: assembly in the courtyard.
Then what?
That's my concern.
You'll have fiive minutes... to clear the walls and reach the woods.
Look, Boeldieu,
I don't know how to put it, but I feel awful about this.
- Come now!
- Yes, awful.
I'd like to say something...
Pour some warm water over my gloves, will you?
Whatever happens,
I want you to know that...
I'm not doing this for you personally.
So we needn't get mawkish.
Go on.
But there are times in life...
Let's avoid them, shall we?
Excuse me...
So you'll be wearing those?
Any objections?
No, but white gloves for this sort of thing, what an idea!
To each his own style.
You can't do anything like other people.
We've been together eighteen months, and you still stand on ceremony.
I'm the same with my mother and my wife.
In that case...
No thanks, English tobacco gives me a sore throat.
No doubt about it: gloves, tobacco...
We've got nothing in common.
Say what you like, but where there are Germans, there is order.
Sure, the old man is a bit mad with his flower pot and all...
A good thing I'm here to keep those scoundrels in check.
I was a teacher back home.
Lieutenant, confiscate those damned flutes at once!
I advise you not to start again!
We'll do just that in 15 minutes.
Order executed, sir.
You see? It worked.
Put them on bread and water for three days. And no parcels.
Ready, boys... Two seconds...
Assembly!
I understand my students now.
What a lark!
While it lasts.
Well...
What?
Goodbye.
Boeldieu!
De Boeldieu!
Listen!
I beg you! Come down!
Lieutenants Maréchal and Rosenthal have escaped.
So that's why.
Search lights!
Send out patrols with dogs!
Alert all military and civil authorities!
Report back to me every quarter hour!
Your orders have been carried out, sir.
No sign of the fugitives yet.
Forgive me.
I would have done the same.
French or German, duty is duty.
Are you in pain?
I didn't think a bullet in the stomach hurt so much.
I aimed at your legs.
It was 500 feet, with poor visibility...
Besides, I was running.
Please, no excuses.
I was clumsy.
I'm not the one to be pitied.
For me it will all be over... soon.
But you'll have to carry on.
Carry on a futile existence.
For a commoner, dying in a war is a tragedy.
But for you and me, it's a good way out.
I missed my chance.
You shouldn't be talking so much.
Sir...
We should've avoided the road.
We couldn't sleep in the reeds.
He's gone.
Didn't you see it was a woman?
- Let's get going.
- Wait till dark.
I'm freezing, I have to move.
Want your sugar?
There's not much left.
And we've a long way to go.
- What about you?
- I ate mine, I was hungry.
You keep it, so I won't be tempted.
You poor thing...
You ate your buttons, too?
Does it show?
So we're not waiting till dark?
No, we'll skirt the village fiirst.
Your foot hurt?
It's nothing... a nerve.
Let's go.
You coming?
You coming or what?
I'm doing the best I can.
You and your foot!
It's not my fault! I slipped.
You slipped! That's all I hear.
If you get us caught, you'll explain you slipped?
We're out offood.
Might as well give up now.
- Gladly. I've had enough too.
- Had enough ofme?
Damn right! If you only knew how you make me sick!
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You're a dead weight, a ball and chain.
I never could stomach Jews!
A bit late to realize that!
Clear out, you're dying too.
You said it!
Get lost! I'm sick ofyour ugly mug!
I'm going! You're on your own now!
So long!
So long! Go ahead!
I'm so happy I could sing...
There once was a little steamboat
Which had ne-ne-nevergone to sea
After five or six weeks at sea
The supplies we real-al-almost gone for good...
Why'd you come back?
Come on.
Let's go, fella.
- Had enough?
- It's okay.
- Want to rest in that shed there?
- Too risky.
- I can't see any smoke.
- Even so...
When the ship's on fiire, you go overboard.
Right. Overboard we go!
Let's go, old man.
- Someone's there.
- The window! Run for it.
I'll draw them off.
Don't move! Keep quiet.
Stay where you are!
French...
We're not thieves.
Prisoners of war?
You speak German?
I sprained my foot. We're exhausted.
We're not thieves.
I'm not afraid.
Go on, call the police.
I won't walk another step!
You sprained your foot?
She says to come into the house.
No, I don't trust her.
She says she's alone here.
She says her child's asleep, so don't make any noise.
Come and sit down here.
I'll be right back.
Hungry? Yes.
- She asked if you're hungry.
- Yeah, I understood.
What about you?
I just want to sleep.
Excuse me, but how far is Wölfiisheim?
Eight miles.
I'd sooner stay here than slog up there!
But duty's duty.
Thanks and good night.
Hush! My child's asleep!
My husband.
Killed at Verdun.
My brothers...
Killed at Liège...
Charleroi... Tannenberg.
Our biggest victories.
The table's too big now.
Relax, it's only me!
You don't mind ifa Frenchman feeds you.
You smell like my grandfather's cows.
A good smell.
You're a cow from Würtemberg and I'm a working man from Paris, but we can still be pals!
You're a poor cow,
I'm a poor soldier.
We each do our best.
You're a bright little girl.
Mommy and I know everything.
Really?
Then how much milk does the cow give each month?
Mommy knows that.
I know I have ten fiingers.
She asked for water.
I know.
For 18 months, I never understood the guards. But her I understand.
- Nice, but it looks cheap.
- I did my best.
I was talking to Santa Claus.
Joseph's got a nice beard!
Here's the Virgin Mary.
Isn't my little donkey cute?
And my ox?
And the infant Jesus...
An ancestor of mine.
"Touché!" as poor Boeldieu would say.
- Think he's dead?
- Let's not talk about it.
We're ready. Go get the kid.
Hold on...
The gramophone and the candles.
Lights out!
Lotte! Baby Jesus has come.
I knew he would!
Is it for me?
I want little Jesus.
To take to bed?
No, to eat.
He's not for eating.
She wants to eat Baby Jesus!
Strictly forbidden, my sweet!
Then I'll eat Joseph.
All right, but in bed.
She wants Joseph? There you go.
You're a good little girl.
Your gramophone's on the blink.
How do you say:
" Lotte has blue eyes"?
Go to sleep, pumpkin.
I don't know how to thank you.
Thank us?
We owe you so much.
Well... good night.
I'll make some coffee.
The coffee's ready.
Say it in French.
Have you told her we're leaving?
Not yet.
It's high time.
You tell her.
- We must be going.
- I knew it.
Maréchal couldn't bear to tell you.
Why?
I always knew he'd have to go.
Come on in.
There's hot coffee.
You should eat something before you go.
Do we wait until dark?
Sure.
Let's say good-bye to the cow.
I've been alone too long.
I've waited so long.
If you knew how happy I've been to hear your footsteps around the house.
Elsa... Listen.
When war over... if me not dead...
Understand?
I... come back here... no?
And you... after... come... with me... to France.
With Lotte... no?
For the journey.
Go quickly. It's better that way.
- Not looking back?
- If I do, I might never leave.
- Let's move.
- We're not waiting till dark?
We'd lose ourway.
The woods will hide us. But in the valley, we'll have to stay low.
You're sure that's Switzerland?
- Positive.
- It all looks the same.
You can't see borders.
They're man-made.
Nature couldn't care less.
I want to see an end to all this.
Then I'd go back for Elsa.
- You love her?
- I think so.
Even if we do make it, you'll go back to flying and me to gunning, we'll keep fighting.
Like the fellas.
We've got to end this damn war... and make it the last.
Don't delude yourself.
Let's come down to earth.
What if we run into a patrol?
We split up, and try our luck. just in case, let's say goodbye and see you soon.
- So long, you dirty Jew.
- So long, you old dog.
Don't shoot!
They're in Switzerland.
Good for them!
Burn, Rome! Burn!
"If in the melancholy shades below
"The flames of friends and lovers cease to glow
"Yet mine shall sacred last
"mine, undecay'd
"Burn on through death
"and animate my shade
"Lo, the blaze aspires!"
Nero.
Go away, Tigellinus.
The fire is spreading.
Look at this.
I was in excellent voice, too.
The fire,
I dare remind you... the fire is growing.
The fire?
I'd hoped it would.
Rome will be destroyed when I die.
Why not while I live and can see it...
And enjoy it?
But the palace is threatened.
It will fall.
Tigellinus,
I will build another.
A fabulous one... so that Nero can be housed like an emperor.
And like a god, immortal Caesar.
Yes, now go away.
Caesar... there are angry rumors that you set fire to the city.
Caesar might do well to avoid the blame.
Blame?
What are you jabbering about?
Who blames the master of the world?
Caesar, when thousands are perishing...
Let us hope that most of the dead are Christians.
They're increasing.
Did you know that?
We've hunted and killed them like rats.
Yet the empire swarms with them.
A dangerous superstition,
Tigellinus... that teaches that the meek shall inherit that which belongs to the mighty... that accepts another god in place of myself.
It shall not live, Caesar.
Tigellinus.
Yes, divine Caesar.
These rumors about my setting fire to the city.
Couldn't we shift the blame to...
The Christians?
If the populace could learn to fear and hate them... they might destroy them... where my own minister has failed.
Now go away.
Caesar.
"Lo, the blaze aspires!
"The glowing ocean reddens with the fires
"Confessing Jove
"Then swift from all sides pour
"The hissing brands
"The curling volumes rise
"And sheets of rolling smoke
"involve the skies"
Devil's luck.
How much now, Strabo?
A couple of pig's eyes.
All I got.
Well, trap a Christian.
They hide in their holes like rats.
I got a nose for them.
Nero's reward.
Two hundred pieces.
Who are you?
Titus, a stranger in Rome.
How do you know me?
You were described to me.
Where do you come from?
Jerusalem.
I was sent by Paul, apostle of...
Wait.
Not here.
Since the great fire, we have lived in terror.
If they killed out all the Christian lice, me and you would have to go back to work.
Are you meeting tonight?
Yes, near the Cestian Bridge.
I'll tell them Paul's message and how...
Devil take them! You put a Christian curse on them!
Come.
Lice!
Hey, those are mine.
Hey, look out where you're throwing those sheep knuckles, will you?
Get your skinny shins out of here.
Hey, Strabo!
Look.
The sign of the cross.
Flowers. Roses.
Flowers. Roses. Flowers.
You ought to close up shop on a day like this, Tybul.
Why today?
Well, the rains are over and everybody's out.
You ought to give yourself a holiday.
If I played,
I'd bring the rains back.
You would.
Look, Christians!
Where?
Down there.
I know. There was a sign in the dust.
Come on, there are Christians!
Where?
Down there. Come on.
Down there. Look.
Come on.
Who are they?
Does anybody know?
Look, they caught some Christians!
They got some Christians down here. Come on.
Come on.
Hurry! Hurry!
What's that?
I don't know.
Sounds like a street fight.
Good. Let's go and see.
Come on.
Come on, Philodemus.
Come on! Come on! Look!
Nero's lions are going to eat.
Vile killers, that's what they are!
The dirty Christian dogs!
They ought to kill all of them.
Come on, come on, let's stone them.
Keep them back. If they kill them, we won't get our money.
Hang on to them!
Christians! Stone them!
Look, it's Marcus.
You dirty Christians!
I'll kill you.
Marcus Superbus!
Stand away!
What have these old men done?
We found them.
There's a reward coming to us.
What did they do?
I tell you, there was no...
Me and Strabo saw what they did.
Quiet, you!
Well, go on.
Why did you stop?
I...
I didn't know.
What?
That it was the Prefect of Rome.
Well, all the better.
You have the highest authority in Rome, next to the Emperor, to judge this case.
Aren't you pleased?
Now watch justice go blind.
What's your name?
Mercia.
And you?
Favius Fontellus.
This man is Titus, my friend.
Is this girl your daughter?
No.
Then why... She was trying to protect me.
Well, I... I envy you.
What is this old man to you?
She...
She can talk.
He's my teacher.
Who are your father and mother?
They're dead.
You live with him?
Yes.
May they go now?
What's your faith?
My friend and I are philosophers.
He's lying.
They're Christians.
Yeah.
Christians!
Viturius, clear the street!
There's a reward on them, Excellence.
They made the sign of the...
I said, clear the street.
Begone!
Out of the way!
Clear the way! Begone!
Clear the way!
Get out! Get out!
Begone, there! Begone!
Out! Out!
Get out! Get out there!
Out!
Well, you...
You are free to go.
We thank you.
Is there anything more
I can do?
Nothing, Excellence.
We are grateful.
Come, Mercia.
Excellence.
Still, I...
I wish there were... something more.
Follow them.
Find out where they live... and find out which fountain she goes to.
Yes, Excellence.
Marcus, my illustrious friend... will you leave your trance for a moment?
Dacia! Glabrio!
She was a rare specimen, I needn't tell you.
Your eyesight gets better with age.
A tasty dish for your banquet tomorrow evening.
Yes. Yes, I'll tell the cook.
Oh, Marcus?
Yes.
Someone expects you this afternoon.
Yes, yes.
Why, I never saw a man so distracted.
I never saw a man with better reason to be.
You mean that girl, of course.
And you said Rome was dull.
Did I?
Well, I know exactly how to stir up some excitement.
Which perfume, Empress?
The jasmine and the acacia.
We must hurry, Zona.
No.
No, not yet.
Another minute, and then we'll hurry.
Empress, a visitor.
Marcus already?
No, lady.
Empress.
My dear Poppaea.
Why, Dacia, you're perspiring with news.
I was famished for a chat.
I have a great deal of news.
Well, I haven't time for a chat.
Did you deliver the message?
Dear lady, of course I did.
Of course you would.
Such things are the breath of your vicious little nostrils.
Did he say anything?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
And what does "nothing" mean?
Perhaps all sorts of things, but...
But you haven't time for a chat.
I'll tell you when to go, dear Dacia.
Zona, all of you, go away.
Will Marcus be here or not?
I told you, Majesty, he said nothing.
Did he smile, or did he frown?
Well, he didn't smile.
It must be some other woman.
And I told him the Empress wished to see him alone, and immediately.
Stop drooling, Dacia.
Is it serious?
I hope not... but you know Marcus.
And there are so many beautiful women in Rome.
Dacia, you're a butterfly with the sting of a wasp.
Take off your clothes.
Get in here and tell me all about it.
Can't you think of a single reason why he let them go?
No, Excellence.
Very competent spies.
If your brains were as good as your smell for money...
Go back to that bake shop.
Ask for her.
If you can't find out anything, watch for her.
Get out!
Marcus letting
Christians go free.
Why?
I don't know, yet.
But this is what
I've been waiting for... to break his favor with the Emperor... and restore mine.
I like that cup of yours.
Would you sell it?
Why...
It's gold.
Would you mind?
Thank you.
I'm very thirsty.
In fact, I don't know when
I've ever been so thirsty.
In that case, you'd better drink it, hadn't you?
Yeah, that's right.
Thanks. Thanks very much.
Don't you remember me?
Of course.
Well, then why run away?
You're not afraid of me, are you?
No.
You're harmless enough.
In fact, quite different...
Different? From what?
What do you mean by that?
I mean... many times I've seen you riding through the streets... the Prefect of Rome... in your armor, with your guard, and now you're so human.
Didn't you know I was?
Well, yes, I've heard of your reputation. What do you...
You mean...
You mean, that I'm wicked?
Well, yes, something like that.
Well, not all of it's true.
Perhaps not... because your face doesn't look like that. It's...
It's what?
Oh, I don't know.
It's just different. No, wait.
Is that a command?
I wouldn't do that.
You could, being Prefect of Rome.
But I don't want to be Prefect with you unless you try to leave me.
You were too hard to find.
Do you imagine you're just going to walk away from me like this?
But I will, eventually.
But that would be a sin.
Didn't you know you'd see me again... and that I wouldn't let you go?
I see your reputation isn't altogether false.
Do you...
Do you dislike me?
No.
Well, you shouldn't.
You must like me.
In such things,
I always have my way.
No.
The Emperor commanded me to find you and deliver this myself.
What is it?
Who is this girl?
I'm going.
No, wait.
You met her for the first time today, didn't you?
What is this message?
I'll read it.
"To my well-beloved Marcus.
"The extermination of
Christians must continue.
"None may escape.
"Those who are dangerous are instantly to be killed.
"The others are to be held for death in the arena.
"This duty has long been entrusted to you.
"I charge you to be faithful."
And the Emperor's seal.
I'm going.
I'll go with you.
I'd rather go alone.
By this order, Marcus, any person even suspected...
I heard the order.
Then that is all.
Don't rush off like that.
One would say you wanted to follow that girl.
At your age, too.
Absurd!
Why was this order given me in the street?
Why were you so anxious to find me?
The Emperor was anxious.
Did you make him that way?
I don't know what you mean.
She's out of sight.
Don't let me keep you.
And she's been in here many times... and you don't know where she lives.
You're lying.
No. No, I'm not.
You know that it means death to hide a Christian?
I'm not hiding her.
I've told you all I know.
Are you sure she paid for the bread?
Yes.
And then...
Then she ran out... and didn't take it with her.
Wait here.
She may come back.
Mercia, Bucco says he wonders when he can have his soup bone.
Tell Bucco, as soon as the soup's ready.
Bucco, aren't you ashamed to hurry Mercia like that?
You know, Bucco, you and I get hungry about the same time.
Greedy!
I wish you could stay longer with us.
There's no time.
I must take this letter of Paul's to Spain and Africa.
It's an inspiration... to copy Paul's own word and keep it.
Mercia! Mercia!
If you'll wait until I have finished writing, I'll help you chop the carrots.
Mercia, water's dripping from that jug.
Is it leaking?
I dropped it.
But I didn't know that...
It was surprising today, wasn't it... to see what Marcus Superbus was really like?
In what way?
I mean... as generous as that... and likeable.
Yes, and he used the whip.
He was taught to use that.
He should be untaught.
Do they all know about the meeting tonight?
All except a few.
I'll send Stephan to tell them.
Come on, come on.
Why send a child on such an errand?
He's less likely to be suspected.
You saw today what can happen.
Are they brother and sister?
No.
Their parents were coated with pitch... and burned as torches to light up one of Nero's orgies.
They died like hundreds of others lately... holding to the truth.
Come here, Stephan.
Yes, Father.
Oh, I forgot the bread.
You know we meet tonight, don't you?
Yes.
In the ruins, at the grove?
I know, Father.
Well, go and tell
Melos and Caius.
Keep to the narrowest streets and be careful you are not watched.
Stephan, you're not too hungry to go before supper?
No, it won't take me long.
Stephan.
Do you know why you must be careful?
Yes. Because there is danger.
Of what?
Death.
Stephan...
I saw the Master.
Did you?
I was in Jerusalem by the Damascus
Gate when he passed.
I saw him carrying the cross.
You know what he did for us?
He gave his life.
Yes.
If you had seen him, you would love him as much as I.
I would gladly die for him.
Would you?
Yes.
You would not betray any of us?
You would be faithful even unto death?
Yes.
Stephan, wait!
I forgot the bread. Will you stop for it?
Yes. I'll need money.
No, I paid for it.
Just tell him, he'll remember.
He'll give it to me.
Tybul knows me.
Tybul! Tybul!
Mercia, told me to get...
Well, you're late today.
But we...
And you're lucky.
There's a loaf of bread left.
But Mercia forgot.
In a few minutes,
I'd have gone home... and you'd have gone hungry, young man.
Money first.
But Mercia paid for it.
Well... Don't you remember?
Of course you do.
She laid the money right here and ran out.
Give it to me. We'll need it for supper, please.
Night.
Come on.
I'm not certain of these words.
"According to his mercy, he saved us."
Stephan?
No, that isn't the knock we use.
Who's there?
Open!
Who are you?
Marcus Superbus.
Better let him in. But, without any evidence he may...
Oh, why distrust him?
Open!
Mercia, go into the other room.
Good evening.
A bolted door isn't very friendly.
We never mean to bolt it against a friend.
We are honored, Excellence.
Is there something you want?
Yes, but I don't see what I want.
You were very kind today,
Excellence. We thank you again.
Never mind that.
Where is Mercia?
May I ask what you want with her?
You're too old to understand.
It's only a letter.
Yes. So, I see.
I don't want to know what sort of letter it is. At least, not tonight.
If you are Christians, it won't matter much to you, of course.
You're old. You haven't long to live anyway.
Mercia has most of her life before her.
Why haven't you sent her away, out of danger?
Is that what you've come to tell me?
No.
I'll save you the trouble of sending her away.
I have come to take her myself.
What do you mean?
Just what I say.
Is it her safety you're concerned about?
Well, that first, yes.
Is she here, or shall I find out for myself?
Mercia.
We didn't say goodbye at the fountain.
Yes, I remember.
Just as well we didn't.
Strange for you to come here.
Why? You might have known I would.
Only because we didn't say goodbye?
Perhaps so we'd never have to say it.
You know, this jug broke when we dropped it.
Good. Good,
I'll buy you a better one.
Mercia.
Wait!
The old man is alarmed,
I think.
You see,
I told him the real reason why I came.
He doesn't understand, but you will.
I want you to leave this place, come with me.
Why?
Because you're in great danger here.
Why? As long as you continue to live... with these Christians, if they are, of course.
Perhaps you don't know what Christians really are.
I know enough.
They're so dissatisfied with the world that they'd like to destroy it.
I've heard they want to save it by making men spiritually free.
Yes.
And would even kill
Caesar to do it.
I've heard they wouldn't kill even such a monster as Nero.
Titus!
Either you must die for treason... or I must forget what you've said.
Maybe you're not Christians, but you're suspected... so Mercia cannot remain here.
That's all I care about at the moment.
She has a right to happiness.
Your kind of happiness...
We're not discussing that now.
Oh, wait, Favius.
I'm glad you came, that you cared enough to come.
But you don't understand.
I belong here with Favius.
Because he wants you to stay?
Because I want to stay.
Even if these men really...
I belong here.
You have strong convictions.
Try to understand.
Don't you value your life any more than that?
Perhaps...
I hold my life more dearly now than ever before.
But I don't know danger.
Oh, but it's not only danger
I want to take you away from.
It's this poverty, this...
Favius, Stephan's arrested!
Who is Stephan?
I...
A boy living with us.
Why was he arrested?
I don't know.
Who arrested him?
Licinius, his men.
And where did they take him?
To the district prison.
If that boy knows anything, they'll make him talk.
Help him.
Why, of course.
Because if he talks, they might take you away before I could.
Can't anything be done?
If one of us falls by the wayside, the others must go on.
Hadn't you better change the meeting place?
It's too late.
But Stephan won't talk.
Oh, poor Stephan!
Answer!
Answer!
Do you follow this Christ?
Are you a Christian?
There's a meeting tonight.
Where is it to be?
For the last time, will you tell me?
I'll make you talk.
No. No.
No. No.
I didn't do anything.
No. Let me go! Leave me.
What are you going to do with me?
Will you tell me where they meet tonight?
Will you answer?
Will you answer now?
Please! Please,
I can't stand it.
Then answer.
I won't.
Yes! Yes, I'll tell!
I'll tell!
Well, where's the meeting?
The grove. The grove.
The Cestian Bridge.
And who are the others? This Mercia, is she one of them?
Answer!
I'm... I...
Answer!
Wait!
He's fainted.
Bring him up.
Well, we've heard enough.
Get your men.
We'll destroy this band of Christians... and then let Marcus explain to Nero why he didn't.
What have you been doing with that boy?
There's evidence he's a Christian.
What did he say?
Nothing. Unfortunately, he fainted.
If he hadn't, you would have torn a lie out of him.
It all comes from my zeal in Nero's behalf.
You'll forgive me.
Is it true that this boy said nothing?
Tell me. What did he say?
Answer me when I tell you to!
What did this boy say?
Pardon, Excellence.
He cannot speak.
He has no tongue.
Get some water.
Why don't they sing loud?
We can't.
Why not?
Titus has come from the shores of Galilee.
He came with the Master's blessing, and to talk to you.
Oh, give us the message.
Give us the word.
He brings us Paul's word.
He comes from afar.
Quiet, quiet.
I am not a teacher, but one of you.
I saw Jesus.
You saw him?
He saw him.
I heard him speak.
Here. Here, drink this.
I couldn't stand the pain,
I couldn't.
Here, you're all right now.
I told Father Titus
I'd never betray them.
I don't want to live.
I don't want to live.
The men are ready, Excellence.
What did you say to them?
I don't want to live.
Now listen to me. Did you say anything about Mercia?
Come on now, tell me.
Don't be afraid.
I want to help her.
I don't believe you.
Do you want her killed?
No, no.
Well, then what did you tell them?
The meeting place tonight.
Will Mercia be there?
Yes, everybody!
Oh, I shouldn't have told.
I should have died first.
I can save her if you'll tell me.
Where is the meeting?
At the grove... by the Cestian Bridge in the temple ruins.
Take care of that boy.
Nothing I want so much will get away so quickly.
I shouldn't have told.
I shouldn't have told.
"We are to become as children," Jesus said...
"with a child's simple loving vision."
If we have the simplicity... the faith, the trust of a child... we accept that which we do not fully understand.
Keep your men quiet.
Quiet, men, quiet.
For me, for all men... he lifted the black mist from the face of God.
And there was no longer the God of wrath... but only a loving father.
All that we had been taught before about the great Spirit... became suddenly a new understanding... a compassionate God to whom we could turn.
The blood of these martyred followers of Jesus... is not yet dry on the stones of Jerusalem.
Another Helen of Troy, only more beautiful.
Good night, Empress.
Morpheus give you deep slumber.
Thank you.
I'd rather have exciting dreams.
I'd love to share them.
Look out!
Get back! Get back!
Careless, drunken dog!
Arrest him!
Why, Marcus.
What an impetuous young man.
Empress!
Is this your carriage?
It was.
And I might have been in it.
Oh, the gods forbid.
I shall beg your pardon properly tomorrow.
Why not tonight?
Because I'm in great haste tonight, on the Emperor's most urgent business.
Come here.
I'm the Emperor's most urgent business.
Do as I tell you!
Your wishes are sacred to everyone, Empress.
I doubt that.
Where have you been for days?
I expected you here at Dacia's house tonight.
Must I sacrifice a carriage in order to catch a glimpse of you?
Tomorrow you shall have a very colorful account of everything.
Where are you rushing to tonight?
Is it a love affair?
I hope it may end in one.
I thought it was something of the sort.
Where are you really going, Marcus?
The Empress is romantic and must understand that I...
No, I don't.
You must explain.
I will. I will, tomorrow.
Tonight, Marcus.
And you will be amused.
And so, Empress... Marcus.
Good night.
Marcus, I insist.
Follow them.
Find out who she is.
Since knowing him and since following the truth... old habits have slipped from my body.
There are no longer any earthly bonds confining my spirit.
All is at peace within me.
If every living man knew what I know... if I could be sure that the message is in every heart...
I could be wholly at peace.
As Jesus loved God, so he loved his brothers... who are also the children of God.
With understanding, with faith... he held power over all things, even death.
He proved there is no death... only a crossing over to the Father... and life everlasting.
Jesus knew it. He lived it.
He walked the earth in goodness... telling that we're all of his blood, his spirit.
Work for one another, comfort one another... that was his cry.
Love your neighbor as yourself.
That is what he came to teach mankind.
That message is heard.
It will be carried to all men... to the farthest corners of the earth.
And God will walk among us... and you will go out into the world... and you will carry to your brothers a new life... and that new life is freedom.
Freedom as vast and beautiful as heaven is. And...
Why, look!
It's an arrow.
He's hit. Titus is shot.
Where did it come from?
Look!
The Emperor's soldiers!
Flank out.
We are betrayed.
Oh, merciful Father!
Titus! Titus!
Put out the brands!
Death is nothing to fear.
Father, no! Father!
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done... on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread... and forgive us our trespasses... as we forgive those... who trespass against us.
Blessed are they who are persecuted for...
Favius!
Mercia, my dear. I...
It's Marcus!
Marcus Superbus!
Hark, the Prefect.
Stop firing!
Mercia.
He's dying.
Favius.
Come with me. Quick.
Isn't that the girl you were talking to at the fountain, Marcus?
You couldn't have known that she was a Christian... or you wouldn't have let her go after hearing the Emperor's orders.
Why was this execution stopped?
Your apparent concern for these
Christians is traitorous.
Withdraw that.
If I was too hasty,
I'm sorry.
Help him.
Can't you do something?
Peace be with you.
With you both.
Go and find them! If you find them, make them talk!
Well, what are the Prefect's orders?
What's to be done with the Christians?
Say you will lean on me.
I can't hold on much longer.
I'm dying.
Viturius...
Iook after the wounded... and take the others to the Martian prison.
Why to the Martian prison?
Why not to the arena dungeon?
Let it stand as I said.
To the Martian prison!
In God's name, be merciful to us!
God is mercy.
Come on.
Viturius!
Here, Excellence.
At the change of watch tonight, take the girl from prison.
Bring her to my house.
Put a woman servant with her.
Excellence, that's dangerous sport.
Do it.
Yes, Excellence.
Daughter. Oh, Lord.
Mama.
Come, little sister.
I'll take care of you.
Come on, come on.
Here's one you forgot.
You sent for me, Empress?
Having to send for you hurt my vanity a bit. Oh, I'm sorry, Empress.
Leave us.
You don't need to call me Empress.
I should have been here earlier to apologize for my rudeness last night.
Oh, don't bother.
I've since learned why you had to be so abrupt.
And you have these enemies of Nero safely in prison.
It's true, isn't it?
Yes.
All of them?
Yes.
Even this baby-faced
Christian girl?
Tell me.
Even this girl who parades as innocence and purity... and is the scum of Rome?
Poppaea!
Why, you're angry.
You misunderstand.
I have no serious interest in the girl.
Oh, don't be stupid.
All Rome knows that she's in your house... and Rome is laughing about it.
Well?
Sit close to me, Marcus.
I've loved you.
You've never returned that love.
You've hardly been friendly.
Oh, I know.
You haven't wanted a vile court intrigue with me.
I haven't either, particularly.
But what else is there?
So I've waited... thinking you've kept away out of loyalty to Nero... and that finally you would... comfort me in spite of it.
So I've waited... being jealous and hurt... while you played with a dozen less admirable women.
But this is different.
Knowing I cared for you... you've preferred to make a fool of yourself over this Christian outcast.
Yes, you are right.
I am loyal to the Emperor.
Too loyal to aspire to an intrigue with the Empress.
Is that evasion?
No, it's the truth.
Then I shall go on hoping to make you forget that loyalty.
If I can't, someday... to my shame...
I may command you to forget.
Your pardon, Empress.
Marcus.
Marcus. Do you love this girl?
Answer me!
Well, then I...
I don't know.
That says you perhaps do.
I could laugh with Rome about it if I didn't care so much.
Marcus Superbus... caught at last by a Christian wanton.
You've no right to call her that.
Oh, very much in love.
Well, why not? It's not so impossible, so laughable.
She's young, beautiful, virtuous.
I find I'm sick of patrician women... who haven't heard of virtue.
That's a direct enough insult.
I couldn't avoid it.
I never saw a man who held his life so cheaply.
That sounds like a threat.
I've never threatened with you.
I shan't, unless you drive me to it.
The game is dangerous enough without my threats.
Tigellinus knows what you've done.
No citizen can protect a Christian from the law.
Well, in this case, I...
I can't stop to remember the law.
Then I shall make you stop to remember me.
You'll give up this girl, Marcus.
Will I?
Yes.
You'll forget about her entirely.
I've stayed too long.
Empress.
They were meeting openly,conspiring openly against your life... and Marcus wouldn't permit them to be killed.
Do I make myself understood, Caesar?
Yes.
My head is splitting. The wine last night, the music... the delicious debauchery.
Caesar, will Marcus go so far as your overthrow... and your death?
Why are you always frightening me like that?
Plots against my life.
Death rides in the street with me, he eats out of my plate.
Marcus took them to prison and there released the most dangerous of them.
That can't be true.
How much further will he go?
I'll stop him right here.
I've been too lenient.
I'll make an example of Marcus.
I order him to be seized.
I shan't rest until he's dead.
Until who is dead?
Poppaea.
Do you know what Marcus has done?
Yes.
I think it's very amusing.
You...
I'm telling you he's turned traitor.
He's released some dangerous Christians.
Oh, just one.
A pretty little Christian girl, not dangerous to anyone... except Marcus himself.
But, beloved...
Marcus is just a man with a thrilling weakness.
He took this girl to his house.
He's such a willful, energetic boy.
Rome is amused, and you're alarmed.
Shame on you.
Caesar, the edict was not obeyed.
Yes. Can you be amused at that, Poppaea?
I can, because it was the girl's fault.
Destroy the girl... not your most devoted, reliable officer.
Simply give Tigellinus an order to take her out of Marcus' hands.
Nero, beloved... don't listen to everyone when you have me.
You'll make a blunder someday that will make people laugh at you... the same as they're laughing at Marcus now.
I'm not at all well, Poppaea.
I know. You had such an exciting night.
There now, relax.
Caesar, if I...
How can you disturb our beloved Emperor when he's feeling so badly?
If it's the order for the girl you're concerned about...
I'll dictate that myself.
Beloved, there.
Marcus! Marcus, where are you going?
Be careful, Marcus.
Ancaria won't let her go.
What ails you, Marcus? Is it your heart or your stomach?
By Jupiter's thunderbolt, Marcus... you haven't finished your cup!
Something needs my attention, something very personal.
Keep it going!
Bring her here.
What's all this about?
Why have you left the table?
Why eat stale bread when there's luscious food in the house?
You go on back. Go on back and make my apologies.
Luscious food?
Oh! I see.
Yes.
Marcus.
Yeah.
I hear Christians aren't digestible.
Never mind, never mind.
Go on, go on.
Marcus!
I intended to see you sooner.
Oh, Marcus. I couldn't understand why you didn't.
I was called to the palace.
And then this banquet's been raging since noon.
Marcus, I told you last night... my life means more now than...
I haven't forgotten that.
Suddenly everything changed.
I wanted to live.
You will, Mercia.
How can I now?
Some way, it will be done.
You belong here with me, and you'll stay.
Oh, you don't know what I'm saying.
I can't live if the others are killed.
Something must be done for them.
No, it's impossible.
Not to you.
Isn't there something?
No. No, you'll have to forget them.
I couldn't.
There'd be no happiness for the rest of my life.
Oh, that's absurd.
Even with you.
Try to help them.
What do they mean to us?
I'm one of them.
Not anymore.
I don't understand you.
There's nothing to understand.
You're here, that's all.
They don't exist anymore.
Oh, wait, Marcus.
An entirely new life begins for you.
With me. Tonight.
I see.
Oh, Mercia.
I was very simple.
I thought there'd be something better for you and me.
Better?
It doesn't matter to you what I think or feel, so long as I'm here.
It never did matter.
Oh, Marcus... you never meant anything but to make me one of your slaves.
Don't think of it that way.
I want you here.
You want to be with me, you'll have everything with me.
No, I'd rather go back to them.
We have a right to this.
I can't see it like that,
I can't.
Well, then something has twisted you out of all natural feeling.
Your kind of life, your faith has done it.
I've always believed Christianity was merely stupid... but it's vicious if it can do this to you.
Where is this luscious food?
Careful, Marcus.
Ancaria has blood in her eye.
If the host deserts his guests, the guests shall find the host.
And here we are.
I hope never to rise again.
Look out, Marcus.
Here she comes.
Ancaria!
Marcus!
Without you, there's no flavor to the feast.
Marcus... you and I are wasting the evening.
Why...
By the back of Venus, look!
A Christian girl!
I've heard of her.
Marcus plays host all over the house.
A beauty, Marcus.
Why hide her, Marcus?
So this was the enchantment.
Present us, Marcus.
Or aren't we virtuous enough?
It would, perhaps, help you both to know each other.
The lady Mercia, this is Ancaria... the most wicked and talented woman in Rome.
And my friends, who are content with life.
Come and join us.
Bring her out.
No. Leave her alone.
Let's look at this model of purity.
She looks ripe enough for any party.
Tell us, Marcus, was she pleasant?
Superior to me?
Why, she's frozen with virtue.
Couldn't you warm her into life?
No. No, I tried, but I couldn't.
See what you can do, Ancaria.
Try one of your songs.
Yes. A song, Ancaria.
Perfect.
If that doesn't do it, she's dead.
A love song, Ancaria... with the pantomime.
Can you melt snow, Ancaria?
Sing. Try it.
Dance, Ancaria.
Dance the Naked Moon!
Start the music!
The last time she danced that...
Don't tell!
The moon would blush at Ancaria's dancing.
I must have missed that.
Play! Play the Naked Moon.
She's only got two.
Under the naked moon
I found you
We meet
I've seen you in my dreams
In dreams indiscreet
With torture so sweet
I've loved you
in dreams
Breathe upon me
Draw me
Gently touch my heart
What's that singing?
The Christians, on their way to the arena dungeon.
I've danced to dirges, but I couldn't dance to that.
Go on, Ancaria. Go on. Why, you haven't even started to undress the moon.
I can't go on when they are singing like that.
Drown them out!
A love song is stronger than a fanatical dirge.
Keep on! Play!
Love will be warm
In the gold of your hair
Feed from your lips
Atremble with mysteries old
Persuasive, then bold
Until his madness outstrips
I breathe upon you
Draw unto you
And let love spread his wings
We have been two
We shall be one
Both throb
They're coming closer!
They're louder.
Why don't you stop them, Marcus?
Then sing louder yourself!
Play!
Oh! We have been two
We shall be one
What are you smiling at?
Why, you...
I told you to stop them!
Get out!
I told you I couldn't stand...
All of you, get out!
And leave me alone with her.
You, take her out.
Good luck, Marcus.
You'll be back with me!
Well, right now I've got better sport.
Go on, get out!
Get out!
I've heard of worse.
Stop that, Ancaria!
Remove the lights.
Close the room.
Ancaria was frightened by the Christians' singing... but I'm not impressed.
Please send me back to them.
No.
Not yet, at least.
Not until you live as you were meant to live.
Marcus, listen to me.
I don't want to live like this.
I want to die with them.
You mean you'd give up life with me... and would rather die for a belief, for some vague...
It isn't vague. It's certain.
One man proved it.
He changed men with it.
It's an illusion.
It's madness, I tell you.
Rome and mankind will go on as they are forever.
Your Christianity will be stamped out and dead within a year.
I know better.
Mercia, don't you see what this thing has done to you?
It hasn't let you live. It's deformed you.
It's made love impossible to...
As you look at love, yes, not as I look at it.
I've no use for your kind of happiness.
Send me back to them.
No, you're not going to die with them.
You're going to live with me.
Did you think I'd share you with this Christ?
Let me go.
Mercia, be honest. You want to be with me. You love me.
I want to be with them.
But with me first.
Marcus, let me go!
Excellence! Excellence!
Excellence.
What is it?
From the Emperor.
What do you want?
That girl is a condemned Christian.
That's my concern.
Get out!
Not without her.
She goes to the arena dungeon to die with the rest of the Christians tomorrow.
Take her.
I tell you, she's not leaving here.
No, Marcus.
It's a pity she stopped you.
I like you so little...
I wish you had called your men and prevented my taking her.
It would have cost your life.
I hold the Emperor's order.
Face!
Forward!
Caesar, I pledge my honor... that she shall never menace the people of Rome... nor your own most sacred life.
Only let her live.
It must be love that has made Marcus so lenient of Christians.
Yes...
I do love her.
If this one Christian life will make our Marcus happy...
Is Nero justice in the Roman world, or merely a puppet Emperor?
What?
If he is justice... then not even one
Christian can be spared... if Christians are to be killed.
Empress, have mercy.
Poppaea is right, Marcus.
I'm afraid it's impossible.
It must be possible, Caesar.
This must be made possible to me.
No faithful subject would ask it.
I do ask it.
And Nero has no more loyal subject than I.
You, Empress... who knows better than you that I have been faithful to the Emperor?
I have the right to ask.
I have obeyed and honored you.
I have risked my life in your service.
And all that I shall ever ask for it, a small thing to you... is that you give me the life of this one girl whom I love, Caesar.
With my whole heart,
I plead with you to spare her.
No, Marcus.
We do not want barbarians laughing at Roman justice.
This thing I ask is justice.
To achieve it, I will take steps to move the world of Caesar.
I demand that you spare this girl!
Marcus!
You've gone too far.
Seize him!
Nero. Nero beloved.
Love has made him insane.
Caesar, forgive me... but spare this girl if you have any compassion.
Caesar is compassionate... but he is also justice.
I must remain justice, Marcus.
If only she weren't a Christian.
Marcus... if she would publicly renounce her faith...
Not even then.
If she renounced, then justice can be merciful.
I can't stay any longer, Marcus.
But Caesar, she will not renounce.
Then she dies.
Hear me.
Have a little consideration.
Would you have me late for the games?
Caesar.
You harlot.
I love you.
We can't see a thing up this high.
I couldn't get anything better.
The Maiuses got better ones.
Honey! Figs!
They're in the second tier.
We won't see half what they see.
We won't smell half as much
Christian blood either.
I'll wager 500 on Merius, the Gaul.
He's unbeaten.
Well, I'll take the Greek for 200.
Come along. You would, of all the times!
Will they let the Christians defend themselves this time, does anybody know?
I've got two extra seats.
Would you like to sit beside me?
How many chariot colors?
Blue, green and red.
Green is the favorite!
As much as I've got on the green!
Blue to beat him.
Honey, figs.
I saw at least a thousand coffins waiting on the other side for the dead.
Do you know, I generally sink with the gladiators... and revive for the Christians.
You'll miss some wonderful things this time.
Three programs.
You needn't get one for me.
I've changed my mind.
The only red liquid that appeals to me is wine.
Oh, let him go.
He has a heart of cheese.
Come on.
I've lost my tickets.
Well, don't you remember the number of your seats?
I heard the lions all morning.
They're starved. All they've had for days is the smell of bleeding meat.
Honey, figs.
It's a fine program today.
The last two were pretty tame.
Nero's said this is going to be the best that Rome ever saw.
It's about time.
The magnificent tradition of life and death combat is going to the dogs.
Last time they had 40 pairs of gladiators and only seven killings.
It's warm inside.
Get a fan.
One hundred Christians.
Honey, figs.
It doesn't say how they're to be killed, just "execution."
We'll leave that to Nero.
It will be some interesting way.
And bloody enough.
Thank you.
Blessed are the poor in sprit... for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.
I believe, I believe.
But come down and save me now.
Soon we'll stand before God to be judged... to answer for our sin, to stand before his wrath.
His mercy, Tyros.
There is none.
Not anymore.
Mercy has only begun.
I tell you all...
Tyros.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Daughter. Daughter.
Stephan.
I wonder where Bucco is.
Where will he get his dinner?
Oh, Stephan, does that mean you're so hungry?
No.
Water.
Water.
I shall fear no evil, for thou art with me.
Water!
No, I'll take it to him.
Blessed are ye... when men shall revile you, persecute you... and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely... for my sake.
We've called upon him to spare us.
To protect us.
Where, where is he?
He is closer to us now than he has ever been.
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
Walk out upon the sand without fear, singing.
We have sinned.
Death is not the escape.
When even the thief upon the cross beside him... asked him to remember,
Jesus said...
"This day shalt thou be with me."
Blessed are we.
He threw him over his head, didn't he?
Yeah.
Oh, God.
They are beginning.
Hail, Caesar!
We who are about to die salute thee.
I'll wager 50 pieces on the Gaul.
I'll wager that on my Grecian.
I told you we couldn't see anything up this high.
If it wasn't your wife you were taking to the racecourse... if it were some charming friend, you'd sit down in the box seats.
But of course, anything is good enough for your wife and child.
Well, the gallery was good enough before we were married.
We were interested in each other then.
The Gaul has got him!
I'll wager 300 silver... on Demos, the Thracian.
On the Thracian?
Thracian there.
Done. I'll take the Gaul.
If I win, I'll give a feast.
You'll lose.
Mercy! Have mercy!
Mercy, Caesar.
Death! Death! Death!
Three hundred silver.
Hail, Caesar!
Hail, Caesar!
Hail, Caesar!
Hail, Caesar!
Hail, Caesar!
Come on! Come on!
Look! Look!
He's got him.
Look, he's got him.
No, please.
Empress, she will enter alone.
Christ also was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father... so that we also might walk in the newness of life.
Hallowed be thy name.
In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done... on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Christ also was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father.
Forgive us our trespasses.
So that we also might walk... in the newness of life.
In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost.
It's our time. It's our time.
Lord! Lord!
Yes, Tyros, but we're not afraid.
Christ also was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father.
So that we also might walk in the newness of life.
Stand up there!
I want to be near you, Mercia.
Come on, the rest of you.
Onto the sand!
I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid.
Come on, get off there.
Get out! Get out!
Where are we going?
We're going to your mother.
Go proudly, singing!
I can't.
I can't go on, I can't.
Titus said,
"There is no death...
"only a crossing over to the Father."
Save us.
Are you Mercia?
Yes.
You are to wait and go in alone.
But I want to be with them.
The order of the Empress.
Whip the vermin out!
Our sorrow shall be turned to joy.
Joy!
I believe!
I believe!
I'm not afraid.
I'm not afraid.
I shall fear no evil.
Not death, but victory, victory.
Go on! Go on!
Come unto me, all ye that travel and are heavy laden... and I will give you rest.
Thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory.
Get on! Get on!
Blessing to man,
our Father's love
Hosanna
Glory to Christ
Glory and praise

Dear God is living on earth
Giving us the word
Giving us the faith
Telling us of life
Calling us to love

Dear God is living on earth
I want to live.
Stephan.
I can't help it, Mercia.
I wanna stay in the world.
But try to remember...
I betrayed them all.
I'm sending them all to die... and I don't wanna go.
I'm afraid to go.
I'm a coward.
The Lord would hate me.
Stephan.
It was only your body that was weak, not you.
Yes.
Yes, it was my body, wasn't it?
I tried, but I couldn't.
Get that boy out.
Stephan.
Try to remember his courage.
Look up, trust him.
I do trust him.
I will trust him.
I'm ready.
Mercia!
Stephan, look at me.
You said you loved me.
Don't you want to be with me always?
Yes, but I...
Then go without being afraid, believing in him.
I'll be out there in a little while to go with you.
Yes, Mercia.
Come on, get that boy out of here.
I'll be killed first... but I'll wait for you if I can... so we can go to him together.
I'll stand by the door.
And we'll sing.
And then you'll walk on by yourself... still singing.
Glory over the earth
and peace
Glory and peace of God
Mercy over the earth and light
Joy for the faithful son
Blessing to man,
our Father's love
Hosanna
Glory to Christ
Glory and praise

Dear Christ, why?
Mercia, you can't go out into that.
Mercia, we must act quickly.
I've brought the way to freedom.
I can save you.
I knelt before Nero.
There's only one way to escape this horrible death.
He'll spare your life on one condition, if you'll renounce this faith.
Mercia, do you hear me?
Poor Marcus, your eyes are tortured.
Oh, come, Mercia, a thousand gods have been called the true god... but there is none.
Each one is only a fantasy.
Yours is just a mistaken belief.
Renounce it.
No. No, not this one.
Mercia, if you don't want to live for yourself, then for me.
I love you. Can't you see it?
I know I told you so before, and then tried to kill your soul.
I didn't know, I was confused.
I still am, except for one thing.
I know I love you... beyond all doubt, beyond all living without you.
Mercia, I...
I prayed last night... as I imagined you always pray.
I called out to your God to save you, to give you to me.
He wouldn't hear me because I can't accept him in my heart.
I tried, but I can't.
So then I prayed to you.
I do now. Oh, Mercia, live.
Renounce your faith.
Live and be my wife.
Live and be your wife.
If you love me, Mercia.
I do, Marcus.
Then don't leave me. Don't leave me.
I love you, Marcus.
Do you know how much?
And yet I can't stay.
Marcia, listen to me. Renounce your God in name only.
Even though I can't believe in him,
I will respect him.
You'll not lose him, I swear it, if you'll live as my wife.
No, Marcus, to know that you love me is all I can have.
Mercia, how can you do this to both of us?
This is stronger than we are, much greater than our love.
Mercia, live.
Didn't you see Stephan go out there?
Yes, yes. It was horrible.
I couldn't believe it.
But why should you go, too?
Didn't you hear my promise that I would follow him?
You must live, Mercia.
No, Marcus,
I must follow them.
Then if you die, I shan't live either.
You must live.
If only because someday you may know what I know now.
I never will, not without you.
You could teach me to know.
Teach me to...
Come on. You're next.
Excellence!
Oh, Mercia.
Marcus, beloved, someday you'll know.
I can't, I tell you. I can't.
I believe in you, not this Christ.
Excellence, they're waiting.
Oh, Mercia, tell me.
This is all true, isn't it?
An afterlife and happiness?
Yes.
For me, too? Even I could have it?
Yes, Marcus.
I believe you.
I believe what you tell me.
There, with this Christ, we could always be together?
Promise me that?
It's true.
Then I want to go with you.
Marcus!
Yes, with you, now.
But it isn't fair to you.
Yes it is, it's merciful to me.
It's some hope. It keeps you with me, maybe always.
Excellence, the Emperor...
Yes, yes, we're ready.
Come, Mercia.
Why, you're pitying me, and I'm happy.
I can't believe it.
I'm full of strange hope.
Much happier.
You want me to go with you, don't you?
Yes.
I love you.
Well, come, then.
You'll have to go on teaching me, leading me.
Sometime I'll know.
But stay close. Give me your hand.
I can't sing the hymn.
I shan't look up either.
I'll be looking at you... and believing you're my wife.
The most high and mighty sovereign...
...Elizabeth, by the grace of God...
...queen of England.
Mary. Randolph.
Look alive, milord, are you glued to the floor?
Get up! Get up!
- Has something upset Your Majesty?
- Throckmorton, tell them.
Milords...
...Mary Stuart has sailed from France for Scotland.
What are we to do?
Did Your Majesty grant her
England's safe conduct at sea?
No!
She defied my ambassador, defied me...
...refused to acknowledge that I am the rightful queen of England.
- 'Tis true, milord.
- Now she shows her true colors.
Suppose she lands...
...what then?
- Her presence in Scotland will endanger...
...Your Majesty's throne, naturally.
But she is the legitimate heir of Henry Vll...
...and her claims to succeed Your Majesty must be acknowledged.
Not by me. Never.
I should fail in my duty to Your Majesty if I did not state facts.
We must face the fact that, in the eyes of Europe...
...you are a pretender to the throne of England.
Because the marriage of your father,
Henry Vlll...
...to your mother, Anne Boleyn...
...is deemed invalid.
They call me "illegitimate. " Go on.
That being faced...
...Mary Stuart must not be allowed to land in Scotland.
She will use that throne as a stepping stone to yours.
She must be seized at sea.
By English ships, Your Majesty?
But that would offend France, offend all Europe.
Have I no captain who can raise a black flag on occasion?
They do it often enough when I forbid it.
- What happened, Randolph?
- Hawkins. Drake.
What did she say?
Oh, Heavenly Father...
...I give thee thanks for the security of this voyage...
...which has brought us safely to my native land.
Counsel my heart.
Guide my steps in this land of my birth...
...that I may rule with piety...
...and wisdom.
The queen is coming! Prepare yourselves!
The queen is coming!
The queen is coming!
- Quiet!
- No! I've had enough...
Calm down!
- Milord.
- Yes?
Your sister Mary, Queen of Scots, she's on her way to Edinburgh.
You're daft, man!
But I've seen her. She landed at Leith.
She'll be here most any moment.
Your regency's over, Moray!
- You'll step down now.
- Aye.
No longer you'll rule Scotland!
Milords.
We'd better go down and meet her.
No.
You'll wait here.
You've gathered here to welcome her.
Understand?
And another thing:
Remember, you lords are the real power of Scotland.
You can afford to hold your tongues.
I warn you, leave all speech to Lexington, especially you, Ruthven and Morton.
Your Majesty.
James.
James Stuart.
I would have known you anywhere.
And I you, my dear sister.
Welcome home.
Welcome to Scotland, Mary.
Thank you, James.
Frankly, I was worried.
- Thank heaven you crossed the sea safely.
- Oh, none too safely, James.
We were pursued, nearly taken.
They did capture the ship that carried our horses.
That's why I had to come on that ridiculous horse.
A fine way to travel for a triumphant homecoming.
Pursued at sea?
- By freebooters?
- A freebooter...
...with a skirt, I dare say.
The lords of Scotland are waiting to greet you. They're in the Great Hall.
Will you...? Will you see them now?
Oh, I'm a sight, and I did so want to look my best after all these years.
Remember the old days at Inchmahome, James?
I was a spoiled little girl, and you seemed such a man.
You'll never know how I admired and looked up to you in those days.
You haven't changed at all, James.
I wish to thank you for the welcome you have given me, milords.
I have been 13 years away.
It was not of my own choice that I went away...
...but it is of my own choice that I have returned.
You will find me young, perhaps, inexperienced...
...but with the support of all of you...
...and with the Earl of Moray at my side,
I shall rule fairly and justly.
We thank Your Gracious Majesty.
The name of Stuart, of your father, is loved and honored in Scotland...
One moment, Lexington.
Can't we welcome Her Majesty without the presence of foreigners?
No, David.
Rizzio is my secretary.
He will remain.
Continue, Lexington.
No affront is intended, Your Majesty.
I understand.
On behalf of these lords and nobles of your kingdom...
...I wish to assure you of our unwavering loyalty.
Differences we may have, aye...
...but they shall not divide us.
Differences?
What differences?
Nothing that cannot be resolved,
Your Majesty.
What differences, milords?
Lexington meant nothing of any importance, my dear sister.
Exactly what did he mean, James?
He was mindful of your religion.
You call that "nothing of importance"?
It's your religion, too, James.
Please try to understand...
...conditions are changing.
The old faith is passing.
This is John Knox's day in Scotland.
And you've gone over to his side?
I've only followed my conscience.
I hope you have one, James.
I had your own interest at stake.
I was regent.
It was my duty to protect your throne.
- By attacking what I hold most dear?
- By making friends with Knox.
Do you realize the power he holds over the people?
If you want the people behind you, do as Moray has done.
Aye, there's Elizabeth.
Where is Elizabeth?
Born in the old faith like yourself, milady.
But she gets off a ship when it sinks.
I don't like your tone, Ruthven.
My religion is no garment to be put on and off with the weather.
You had better know that, all of you!
I shall worship as I please...
...and hope for all men to worship as they please in Scotland.
Good for you, lassie!
You're from the north, Huntly.
- Are you a turncoat?
- No, no.
And I'll defend to the death your right to worship as you wish.
Thank you, Huntly.
And now, let that be an end...
...of this unimportant matter.
Is there anything else on your minds, milords?
- We're to speak about your marriage.
- Ruthven!
Aye!
Go on, Lexington!
We have hesitated to mention this,
Your Majesty...
...but now, you have returned.
- Why mince words, Lexington?
The King of France died when I was 18.
Naturally, I'm free to marry again...
...if I choose to.
We realize the matter is delicate,
Your Majesty.
I'm glad you realize that.
But the matter is of the gravest importance.
These are troubled times.
If you made a foreign alliance, what would happen here?
Until you are safely married to a loyal Scot...
...whom we can trust,
Scotland will be unsettled.
All we wish is to see you safe on your throne.
It's true, my dear sister. Until men know what alliance you will make...
...the clans will sleep with their swords in their hands.
- I suppose you've decided on my husband?
- Aye.
- One of you?
- No, we wouldn't stand for that.
We've considered only your welfare in choosing.
- Choosing whom?
- Lord Darnley.
He is a Stuart, next heir after yourself to the throne of England.
You yourself said that you would never give up your claim to the succession.
Marry Darnley and strengthen it.
Of course...
...I can't give myself out to be a virgin queen...
...like our cousin, Elizabeth.
But suppose I don't choose to marry at all.
Then you'll do as you please, and I'm behind you, lassie.
Thank you, Huntly.
I see I have one friend here.
Where is the other Bothwell? Is he here?
- Why do you laugh, Morton?
- No offense, dear Majesty...
It concerns the Earl of Bothwell?
Something he said about Your Majesty, yes.
And what did he say?
Bothwell said, "You and Elizabeth rolled together wouldn't make an honest woman. "
And do milords allow my name to be slandered?
Aye, Your Majesty, you're mistaken.
There's no love lost between us and Bothwell.
- Take no account of such speech.
- I shall take account of it.
I shall take account of all the veiled insults...
...which have been flung at me tonight under the guise of welcome.
- Lassie...
- I realize now what kind of support...
...I may expect from all of you, even from my own half-brother.
- My dear sister...
- I know where you stand now.
I know where I stand.
Go ahead, form your council, do as you wish.
I'll have no hand in it.
Up until now, I have never done anything of my own wish.
The ambition of other men carried me to France when I was a child.
The ambition of other men married me to a dying boy who became King of France.
I wasn't asked. But I am through.
I'm going to live my own life, do as I say.
I refuse to marry.
I love no one, and I shall marry no one.
I'm going to begin to be myself...
...Mary Stuart.
She sits on that throne only so long as we maintain her there.
- Softly. Softly.
- Why? Do you curry favor with her?
She'll find out we'll stand for only so much!
She'll sit on the throne only as long as we keep her there!
She is our queen, and she'll remain our queen!
- I'll back you in that, Huntly.
- I'll go with you.
Softly. Softly.
There'll be no throne nor Scotland, if we fall out.
- Who's going to keep her in hand?
- I will. She'll accept the council I propose.
Have you already picked yourself to be prime minister, Moray?
Aye. And with Lexington the secretary of state, what have you to fear?
I'll serve her faithfully, Moray,
I promise you that.
Aye, as long as it serves your own purposes.
But who's to look after the rest of us?
I will.
I promise you.
Madonna.
We hail from the burnside
The hills and the glen
When the pipes O' the queen
Sound the call
And glad are the hearts
O' her loyal highland men
Whether victory or death may befall
Tho' the road be long and drear
When the pibroch's ringing clear
With the skirl of Stuarts off to war
We will fight for our queen
She's the fairest ever seen
So the Scots may be free as of yore
For chains shall not bind us
No English yokes shall drop
Let us free Scotland forevermore
And a while ago, I...
I wanted to run away, it all seemed so hateful.
But now...
...I'll find a way to win.
Tho' the road be long and drear
When the pibroch's ringing clear
With the skirl of Stuarts off to war
Scotia land, fresh and fair
Pine and heather fill the air
Bonnie land
That our forefathers bore
Our queen, we'll defend
Stuart's cause will never end
Till we free Scotland
Forevermore
We will fight for our queen
She's the fairest ever seen
So the Scots may be free as of yore
For chains shall not bind us
No English yokes shall drop
Singing, dancing, drinking...
...and all the vile and evil uses of the flesh.
They run before this jezebel of France like a foul air!
Aye, she's a Stuart on her father's side...
...but who was her mother?
Who was her mother?
French Mary of Guise.
She was regent when George Wishart was burned alive for heresy.
And what was his heresy?
Preaching the reformed religion...
...teaching me, John Knox, the wisdom and the glory of God.
Aye, and the flames that consumed my teacher...
...ripped deep into this heart.
Did Mary Stuart come to Scotia...
...while she sat on the golden throne of France? No! No!
She was lost in luxury and the sinful joys of the flesh.
And now, now...
...when fate has cast her down from that throne of sin...
...she remembers another gem in her crown...
...the gem she was born with, Scotland!
The time has come for all men...
...to choose between the kilt of Scotland...
...and this Jezebel of France!
Master Knox.
Aye.
We Scots know who fought for the mother.
Aye, and we Scots remember who fought against her.
Mock me as you will.
You can never silence me tongue.
I'm no such fool, Master Knox.
You can't silence 10,000 trumpets.
But I can match you with a better tune...
...and from a better bag of wind.
- I shall say what I have come to say.
And neither rank nor station shall avail mine enemies.
Follow, my people!
Have we not had enough of the Guises and their followers? Aye!
Let them stick to their warmer climates!
And may they come to a hundred plagues...
...before ever they should have another standard here.
Back! Back, I say!
Stop! Stop, I say!
Stop, or I shall bring down the curse of God upon you!
Stop, or I shall bring down the curse of God upon you!
Stop!
Your Majesty, may I rid your presence of this old goat?
I wish to speak to this gentleman.
Won't you come inside, Master Knox?
Is there anything to fear?
Look at me, Master Knox.
Can you believe in your heart that I'm as wicked as you say?
Do you not bring back the old faith...
...that we've cast out of Scotland as the work of Satan?
Is it a crime to be steadfast in the faith of our fathers?
There is only one true faith, and that I preach.
Preach your faith, Master Knox. Preach it.
Let me practice mine.
- Can I forget whose daughter...?
- It's true...
...I'm the daughter of Mary of Guise.
It is true I keep my mother's religion.
Still, I'll respect your own and will give you as much freedom as I'll demand for myself.
- Aye, they told me you spoke fairly.
- Can't you also? Can't you be tolerant?
I want to be loved by my people.
I need their support.
Your support, your friendship.
You heard my words out there in the courtyard?
I heard words that another sovereign would call treason...
...words another sovereign would punish as my mother punished treason.
I called ye "Jezebel of France" out there...
...and I'll call it ye again.
I believe in your sincerity, Master Knox.
I only ask you to believe in mine.
Can't we be friends?
- I have said what I came to say.
- But you no longer mean it. You're...
Well, blast his insolence.
The old ram, he ought to be hung.
- It will take more than love to rule this land.
- I haven't asked your opinion.
Good.
Good, you've got a temper.
But don't curb it, Your Majesty.
- Force your crown and fear your scepter.
- You the captain of the guard?
No, I only arrived tonight.
Then you'll leave again and not return until you've learned to hold your tongue.
I'm afraid that will be never,
Your Majesty.
I see I've arrived too late.
Moray has already told you about me.
About you? You pride yourself.
Aye.
It's a way I have, Mary Stuart.
- And who are you?
- You heard my pipers.
- You don't remember my clan?
- Which clan?
When you hear those pipes, you know the Bothwells are about.
- So you are the Earl of Bothwell.
- At Your Majesty's service.
Did you say that Elizabeth Tudor and I rolled together wouldn't make an honest woman?
Oh, no, not at all.
What I really said was that the two of you together wouldn't make a proper woman.
But that was years ago when I saw you in France.
Just a skinny little girl.
I wouldn't say it now.
You're a very outspoken man,
Milord Bothwell.
That's one privilege I've always retained.
Oh, come now, you don't want flattery.
I've confessed. Forgive me.
Well, you did fight in defense of my mother.
I thank you for that.
Don't thank me. It was a pleasure.
I have found many enemies here.
Have I also found a friend?
You'll only find out who's your friend in Scotland by putting him to the test.
Tonight, I need loyal backing more than my mother did.
So I imagine. And hearing Moray and the lords were here...
...to welcome you,
I rode over from the border.
To stand with them against me?
Where are they?
They are forming my council...
...in the hall.
- Bothwell, where have you been?
- Down to the border, Morton...
...hanging a few of your clansmen.
Well, milords...
...have you divided the spoils?
We're forming Her Majesty's council.
You, Moray, as prime minister, I fancy.
- Naturally.
- You, Morton, as secretary of state.
- Or is it Ruthven?
- No, Lexington.
- Aye, Lexington.
- Indeed.
Who is to be the queen's lieutenant general?
That's for me!
You're all wrong, gentlemen.
I've decided to take charge of Her Majesty's armed forces myself.
- We'll not allow it, Bothwell!
- You're too late.
- I've just accepted the appointment.
- From whom?
From Her Majesty, the queen.
Didn't you say that Randolph was expected to return from Scotland this morning?
I did, Your Majesty.
I wonder what's keeping him.
Some pretty face, I dare say.
Are you growing jealous of Randolph, Leicester?
Is it any fault of mine, Your Majesty?
More and more now, you're giving your important commissions to Lord Randolph.
- There was a time when I basked...
- Don't say "bask. "
It reminds me of a fish.
Your Majesty, you know my feelings.
You must realize how they're torn when you avert your gaze.
Your Majesty...
...I beg you on my knees.
Milord Randolph, ambassador to Scotland.
Get up!
Did you convey my friendly greetings to Mary Stuart...
...tell her how I rejoiced at her safe return from France?
Most ardently, Your Majesty.
Ardently.
I begin to understand your dallying.
I've heard of her enchantment.
Tell me...
...is she as pretty as they say?
You may see for yourself.
She sent you this token of her love.
A girl.
Not a queen.
Tell me...
...what's she like?
- Most charming, Your Majesty.
Already, she has many suitors...
...chief among them is Lord Darnley.
- Darnley?
Another thorn in my crown.
Weakling.
Drunkard.
He stands next to my throne...
...under her.
I'd be in double jeopardy if she married him.
In my opinion, Your Majesty, the Earl of Bothwell removes that danger.
He leads her troops like a hurricane.
He's restored more order in a month in the north than it's known for 10 years.
He's her mainstay now.
It's plain, he's in love with her.
You think I could sleep with Bothwell on the throne beside her?
But, Your Majesty, she's a creature of love.
Believe me, your fears are unfounded.
- She wins men to her side in gentle ways.
- Aye...
...and I see she has won our Randolph, among others. You shall go north no more!
- Your Majesty...
- Throckmorton, you're a cold fish.
You shall be my ambassador to Scotland.
- But, Your Majesty, I'm simply giving you...
- Leave us! Leave us!
And take care...
...or your heart will fall off your sleeve.
Darnley.
Bothwell...
Am I never to have peace?
- She must be defeated.
- How?
- Declare war. Unite Scotland with England.
- War...
...is that all you men know?
Unite Scotland against England, you mean.
Unite Scotland under Mary Stuart.
But how else is she to be defeated?
You know what it is to be born illegitimate?
To have royal blood in your veins...
...and that one word standing between you and the throne?
How it makes ambition burn?
Who was it ruled Scotland before she returned?
Who wants to rule again?
The Earl of Moray.
You shall ride north tonight as my ambassador, Throckmorton...
...and get in touch with Moray.
So, Lord Bothwell has put down the rebellion on the border.
Has he returned yet?
- Not yet, madam.
- Why that tone?
I no longer have your confidence.
That's not true.
You know you must secure your throne by marrying, yet every time I mention it...
- You don't like Bothwell?
- He has been a good lieutenant general.
- His religion rules him out?
- He has no religion.
- All he believes in is this.
- I should be thankful.
It's done more for me than your music and your continual talk about marriage.
- I'm sorry, David.
- I try only to serve you faithfully.
Yes. You're as fanatical in your way as John Knox is.
I often wonder which you love the most, myself or my religion.
I would never betray either.
You imply that I would?
You are the sole defender of our faith on these isles.
What becomes of that if you marry a heretic?
Meaning Bothwell?
Even Lord Darnley is 100 times a better choice.
At least, he's of the faith.
Why must I marry at all?
To have an heir, to be true to your blood...
...to escape the tyranny of these lords who laugh in your face.
You're a worse tyrant in your loyalty than they are in their disloyalty, David.
I have never urged
Your Majesty to marry a Scot.
Marry in Europe, where your destiny is.
My destiny is here in Scotland.
Whom would you have me marry, David?
Tell me.
Look at these marriage proposals.
First and foremost, Don Carlos of Spain.
Onions.
The archduke of Austria is not so good a match, but he is eager to marry you.
- No, no. Beer, not women.
- The king of Sweden?
But his ears...
- Don't forget the king of Denmark.
- Forget him? Lmpossible.
But would Scotland ever be quiet if I married him?
- I assure you, he's a very peaceable man.
- But they say he snores.
The duke of Anjou.
The prince de Condé.
The duke of Ferrara.
The duke d'Orléans.
Oh, no! Oh, David. David.
David.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to make fun of you.
I know you're right.
I can't put it off any longer.
- But I vow I'll not marry in Europe.
- Marry Lord Darnley then.
There is no one else.
Marry him, madam. I beg you.
Very well, David.
You're not serious.
Oh, yes, I am.
Now it's over.
Finished.
I knew it had to be, really.
Go, summon Darnley.
I'll tell him at once.
No.
No, David.
Lord Darnley.
The four pretty wenches.
Five, milord...
...now that you're here.
I say, you call me pretty?
Well, as I always say, my dears...
...the fairest flower in Scotland grows on the highest bough.
Milord.
I've been waiting all day.
Am I never to see Her Majesty?
You'll see her when she wants to see you, milord.
The four protective angels.
Hello, Darnley.
Still hanging around, eh?
Where's Her Majesty?
In her study, with the English ambassador.
And strict orders not to be disturbed.
Don't shake your finger at me, snub-nose.
I'll spank you where you belong.
I'm left out in the cold, too, Bothwell...
...and these lassies have no time for plain Scotsmen.
- How long am I to be kept waiting?
- Oh, listen to the man.
You'd think he owned the place.
If I did, there'd be no Lord Throckmorton around, I can tell you that.
Oh, I forgot, Darnley...
...he's a friend of yours.
I hear he's promised to back your claim to England...
...if you take yourself out of Scotland.
Jealous, Bothwell?
On the contrary.
I think it's a first-rate idea.
I shall wait for Her Majesty below.
- Don't go on my account.
- I'm not going on your account, sir.
I suppose you laugh at me, too, behind my back.
Oh, no, it's not safe to laugh at a barbarian.
For two farthings,
I'd put you over my knee.
Oh, milord.
- Go tell Her Majesty I want to see her.
- What to do with a man like that?
He won't take no for an answer.
Someday you'll meet a man who won't take no for an answer.
And?
And I'll be the godfather.
- Now will you tell the queen?
- No, I won't.
Then here I stay.
For one hour, Lord Throckmorton, you've been talking in circles.
I still don't know what it is
Elizabeth wants.
- Do I fail to speak fluently?
- Too fluently. You conceal your purpose.
Your Majesty...
You tell me again and again of Elizabeth's friendship.
I, too, give her my friendship.
We're two rulers in two adjoining countries.
We're related by blood ties.
There's every reason for friendship based on understanding.
But how can there be understanding without frankness?
- Be frank. What is it Elizabeth wants?
- Very well.
Marry the man she chooses...
...and she'll recognize you as the next heir to the throne of England.
My succession was ordained by circumstances out of her control.
I don't need her acknowledgement.
My mistress only meant that if you marry the man of her choosing...
...it would indicate no threat to her throne.
- She has someone in mind, I suppose.
- She...
- She did mention a name, Your Majesty.
- Who?
The Earl of Leicester.
She named him?
She had the temerity to name the Earl of Leicester?
No one stands higher in her esteem than Leicester.
Why, she's shown that.
She's flaunted him before all England.
Her favorite, her leavings...
...and now she wants to cast him off on me...
...make me a laughingstock before the world?
- Please...
- You told me what is in her mind.
Let me tell you the rest.
My cousin Elizabeth has never taken a single step that wasn't political.
She's afraid I will marry the one man who embodies everything she fears...
...the man who is next heir after me to her throne, Lord Darnley.
That is sheer imagination.
It is not in my nature to play politics, but now I shall.
There is no other course I can follow and keep face with my faith...
...and with the name I bear.
Now I know what I shall do.
Your Majesty,
I beg of you not to be rash.
Leave me. Go back to Elizabeth.
Tell her what I have said.
David...
...go and find Lord Darnley.
Have you seen Lord Darnley?
- Why?
- Her Majesty wishes to see him.
Privately.
A room's a room, and a door's a door.
I've been waiting to see you for hours.
Are you a man or a storm not to be brought indoors?
- When my girl won't see me, I'm a storm.
- Is that the way you speak of me?
You expect me to bow and scrape and make pretty speeches?
- I'm a soldier. I love you.
- You wanna take everything by storm.
- You know any better way?
- You forget I'm your queen.
Have I ever forgotten that? But I remember you're a woman. Don't forget that.
- I won't be talked to that way.
- Yes, you will.
You're going to listen to me for once.
You know I love you.
You've known it from the first moment I met you.
I command you to leave me.
What's come over you, Mary?
What's happened? You're frightened.
- You say you're a queen, be one.
- What else am I trying to do?
Leave me, please.
- While you go marry someone else?
- Yes.
- Now, I'm in no mood for joking.
- I'm going to marry Lord Darnley.
- You're what?
- Marry Lord Darnley.
- You're out of your mind.
- Let me go.
- No. No, you can't do it.
- Let me go.
- I'll never let you go! I love you.
- You have no right.
I have a right.
Let's not pretend you don't care.
I know days when you did, when you told me so.
Aye, with your eyes, with everything you did. You can't lie to me, Mary.
I made up my mind.
I'm gonna marry Darnley.
Darnley.
Why didn't you pick a man?
Tell me that you love him, Mary, and I'll let you go.
Aye, you can't do it.
I can.
I do.
Will you learn this isn't your kingdom, but mine?
- Yours for how long?
- You think I can't rule without you?
Try it.
- You can't leave Scotland.
- You've seen the last of me, Mary.
- I won't let you leave.
- I don't need your leave nor leave-taking.
I'm just going.
Lord Darnley, Your Majesty.
Lord Darnley...
...you have asked my hand in marriage.
I have decided to grant it.
Your Majesty!
Oh, I've hardly hoped...
I haven't dared...
I'll love you, keep you, defend you.
We shall face troubled times.
This is some dream, a jest.
It can't be true.
And yet...
...it is true.
I never dreamed...
...I'm to hold you in my arms.
They say a kiss seals the bargain.
James, they're waiting for you to say it.
The fact is, my dear sister...
...we're troubled by your apparent lack of confidence in this council.
"Apparent"?
Why not say "obvious," and be frank?
It's our rightful duty to shape your policies and for you to accept them.
Instead of which, you constantly take the advice of your secretary, Rizzio.
I begin to see.
You want me to get rid of David.
Aye, send him back where he belongs.
Well, I shan't.
You'd better think twice about that.
Are you giving me orders?
No, no. Ruthven only meant to say...
I know what Ruthven means to say.
He means to say that I'm a fool...
...though he never dares put it quite that boldly.
Well, I have been a fool.
I lost Bothwell, who held you all in check.
I thought I was ruling Scotland, but it was only his strength behind me.
But I still have David.
You can't take Scotland for yourselves so long as he is by my side.
- I shall never let him go.
- He may be sorry if you don't.
Someday, Ruthven, you may be sorry for that tongue.
In spite of my mistakes,
I've won my people to me.
You all know it and fear it.
Sit down, milords. Sit down.
It's only your king.
Always holding council, eh, Moray?
Always talking, talking.
- You're late.
- I don't take orders anymore.
I'm king now.
Even if someone doesn't seem to know it.
You never can count on a woman.
Marry one, and she turns to ice.
They're all alike, even a queen.
Can't stand the sight of you.
Say you're drunk when you need a kiss or two.
Would you believe it, Moray?
They lock doors at night.
And all the while, they're thinking of someone else...
...some fellow who's gone to France, perhaps!
Mary!
Where's the queen? Open that door!
Open that door!
Well, Moray?
Will Your Majesty sign these papers now?
- Where's my wife?
- Alone with her ladies, sire.
But you have access to her, eh, Rizzio?
Will you sign these papers now,
Your Majesty?
Later. Later!
Now you know.
- If I thought...
- If, if, if!
Open your eyes, man.
- Who else is with her all the time?
- Day and night, alone.
Regain her favor.
Be king in fact as well as name.
Show her you don't lack courage.
Who said I lack courage?!
How dare you address me...
Eight to the clock, and all's well!
The queen's guards.
All's well.
My life is in the north
And my heart is in the south
False I've pledged with my hand
False I've kissed with my mouth
With hand caught to hand
And the rain driving blind
As the new years have driven
Old loves out of mind
As the new years have driven
Old loves out of mind
What is that song, David?
It's a song I made up.
He's always making up some nonsense about love.
Aren't you in love, Beaton?
Just a soldier.
Not a penny to his name.
Why don't you marry him?
- And live on air?
- On anything.
What do you see in the fire, David?
The sunshine of Italy?
You want to go home, don't you?
You're my only friend, and they're driving you away.
I want you to go, David...
...for your own sake.
Though I don't know what we'll do without you.
Milady...
...why don't you recall the Earl of Bothwell?
Let's have no more talk of Bothwell.
- You look surprised, my dear.
- I wish to be alone.
Alone?
- Madonna!
- No!
Ruthven, what are you doing here?
- Ask your husband.
- Do you know?
Madonna!
Let me go! Get out! Get out, all of you!
We intend no harm to anyone except that traitor.
- Traitor? My only friend!
- Aye, too good a friend.
- Your husband knows about that.
- I know who the traitors in Scotland are.
Get out of my room! Lay one hand on Rizzio, I'll see you all destroyed!
Quiet. When Scotland finds out we've killed a rogue in your own bedroom...
If David's done anything wrong, I'll deliver him up for fair trial, but not to assassins!
After him!
David! David!
Oh, no!
David!
Milords. Milords.
Justice. Justice!
Madonna...
You've not only murdered poor David...
...you've ruined me, ruined yourself...
...thrown a doubt on the child
I'm going to have, your child.
I only wanted my rights.
God forgive you.
I shall not forgive myself for marrying you.
Am I to follow David?
- There's no fear if you do as we say.
- Do you hear that?
So long as I'm their prisoner, and my husband backs them up...
...I'm an unfaithful wife, and the people, my strength, will turn against me.
Enough. Before we go further, you'll sign this...
...a full pardon for all of us.
- Never!
- Sign it!
- Ruthven!
She's better off dead if she doesn't sign it.
Aye, we're better off. If she got away without signing it, we'd be done for.
This proves our guilt. Sign it!
Sign it.
Ruthven, Bothwell's returned to Edinburgh.
He's marching here.
- How many men has he got?
- Only a handful.
- Let him come.
- He'll raise the country against us.
He won't have a chance. Open the gates.
Let him come in.
We'll post ourselves in the courtyard.
We'll deal a surprise.
No, wait. I'll sign your pardon.
Aye, you'll sign it well enough with Bothwell in danger.
Darnley, you'll stay here.
Guards.
Don't you see what you've done?
They'll kill Bothwell as they killed poor David.
You're only their shield.
How long will they tolerate you when I'm out of the way?
Why did you do it?
- I wanted to win you back.
- Oh, you're blind.
They had to have you in their scheme to prove their lie, that I dishonored you.
But once they've dragged me down before the people...
...what use will they have for you then?
How long will you keep your crown?
You'll find yourself a prisoner, as I am now.
You'll only be king as long as I'm queen.
You still have a chance to save yourself, to save us both.
- How?
- Help me escape before they kill Bothwell.
- I can't. They'd kill me.
- Not if you're with me.
They'd run for their lives.
They'd leave Scotland, and you'd be safe.
- With you, Mary?
- Yes, with me.
- You'd forgive me? You wouldn't leave me?
- I swear, I'll never leave you.
Madam.
Her Majesty has retired to her bedroom.
- Stand guard there.
- Aye, milord.
Get Bothwell!
Get her.
Aye, the queen.
- Where's the queen?
- In her bedroom, milord.
Where's Darnley?
With the queen, milord.
Will Huntly and his clan join them?
Huntly? Aye, they'll have 10,000 at their backs before morning.
- Aye, and they'll be after us.
- I'm getting out of Scotland.
- I'm with you.
- We're done for, Ruthven.
- Aye.
- She's tricked us.
Never mind her.
- But if ever I lay my hands on Darnley...
- It's every man for himself.
Get over the border while there's time.
No.
Mary Stuart has a son.
And I am only a barren stock.
- Where's Moray?
- Vanished...
...with the other lords who murdered David Rizzio.
I failed.
Failed.
No, I'm not letting you hold the baby.
Now, you're not to touch him.
Now, mind that you give him a bath...
Careful, now. Careful, milady.
- Jamie, Jamie.
- Keep your hand on his wee bit bottom.
Havers, but he's a load, that boy is.
But the best man in Scotland, if you ask me.
He's a bubblyjock, that's what he is.
He ought to be tucked up in bed, that's what he ought to be.
But being this is his birthday, he's got to see his mother first.
Of course.
If we don't spoil the bairn, it's a wonder.
He'll grow up into a great big man...
...and take care of me when I'm an old woman.
She's not much older now than the wee man himself.
Happy birthday!
Your Majesty.
Here's a present for him.
Howt, man.
What would he do with a claymore?
Aye, wait till he grows up.
He'll need it.
- It was your father's, Mary.
- My father's?
I brought it from Inverness.
Aye, he's a Stuart.
Aye.
I hope you won't need it, Jamie.
His Majesty, the king.
What a charming family scene.
We were just admiring your son.
Oh, were you, Bothwell?
Yes, he's a year old today.
Of course, that's why you came back from Glasgow.
I'll put him to bed, sire.
Afraid my presence will contaminate him?
You know that's not true.
Why have you come back?
- Has Ruthven returned to Scotland?
- He wouldn't dare.
- I'd only like to find him if he has.
- You'd like to have me out of the way too.
You'd have them all back.
You know what they'd do to me!
- You're not yourself. You're worried.
- Ruthven's in Scotland.
- Morton too, secretly.
- They're not.
Don't tell me. You know all about it.
- And you, too, Bothwell.
- You're overwrought. You need sleep.
Sleep?
- Not here.
- What do you mean?
I'll not tell you. You won't trick me again.
- I'm gonna leave Scotland.
- You can't. You forget who you are.
What do I care for an empty title?
It's my life. My life, I tell you.
They were my friends...
...Moray and Ruthven.
You tricked me...
...turned them against me.
You've never forgiven me, and never forgotten about Rizzio.
- I kept my word.
- You've never loved me.
I love your son. Think of him.
You can't desert your own son.
I'll disown him.
- I'll deny him his father.
- Your Majesty!
Try and make him king of Scotland and England then!
He doesn't mean it.
He can't.
I've...
I've kept my word with him.
I've endured every...
...insult and every humiliation.
I've done everything...
...but love him.
I've tried, but I...
I can't. I can't.
Mary.
All I ask is to serve you...
...be at your side.
Talk to me about Inverness.
Talk to me about something.
I have to hear somebody talk.
Ten o'clock and all's well!
All's well.
Begone, quickly.
Oh, my people...
...a king of Scotland cries out from his grave...
...for revenge against his murderer!
And is the assassin's name not known?
Those who have vanished have told me his name.
Aye, who was it that coveted the hand of the queen?
Bothwell's his name! Bothwell!
Hear, all ye people...
...the prayer of that infant prince...
...the child of him who was slain:
"Judge...
...and avenge my cause. "
Oh, lord.
Aye, you're my prisoners, Huntly.
- Shall I make a fight for it, lassie?
- I want no blood shed on my account.
Where are you taking us?
Dunbar Castle, Your Majesty.
Well, Huntly?
Man, man, do you think I'm blind?
- How so?
- This abduction, as you call it.
- That's my way.
- No, no. 'Tis hers.
If you cannot pull the wool over my eyes, how do you expect to fool all of Scotland?
I'll take care of myself, Huntly, and of Mary.
Scotland can point no finger at her if I marry her this way, against her will.
- Marry her?
- Aye, why not?
You're mad.
You're both mad.
I'd rather be dead, lassie, than see this night ever come.
You're the Queen of Scotland, and you let the woman in you blind your senses.
Why, he's not even of our faith.
You've always stood by that until now.
If you go on with this make-believe, there's naught but disaster ahead of you.
She has nothing to do with it, I tell you.
If you feel that way, Huntly, draw your sword against me.
I'll not draw mine against any friend.
You'll have no friend.
Here, lassie, take this...
...and turn it on yourself if what you speak is true.
There's honor in that escape.
You may go, if you wish, Huntly.
Go back to Edinburgh. Join Moray and the rest. Stir up the clans against me.
No, no, they'll do that themselves.
You'll put yourselves in Moray's power again.
Three of the clock, and all's well!
- Are you afraid, my Mary?
- No.
- I'll send you back with Huntly.
- Why?
From the very beginning,
I've always belonged to you.
I knew it.
How vast the night is.
How bright and wonderful.
I've never seen it like this.
Nor I.
Why, look there.
- Make a wish.
- I have.
They say there's a star for each of us.
I used to imagine that when I was born,
God put a dark star in the sky...
...a star nobody could ever see, not even me.
And then one night,
I'd see a flash of light...
...and I'd see my star, but it would be falling, and I'd be gone.
Aye, dark or bright...
...I'll always follow your star, Mary.
It was dark because I...
I didn't really exist at all.
I was a dream, and I was the one who was dreaming it too.
That's absurd, isn't it?
- Perhaps I didn't really exist until I met you.
- Aye.
There was a memory of being a child in a country like this.
And then they told me that my father was dead...
...and I cried.
When they told me that I was Queen of Scotland...
...it didn't mean as much to me as my dolls.
And then I was very important...
...not to myself, but to grown-up people.
And then, one day,
I caught a glimpse of my star...
...and they took me away, at night, on a ship.
It was all so strange.
The sea, vast, like this.
The world seemed enormous.
And then we came to another land, and they told me it was France.
Everything different.
People singing, laughing.
They were all happier.
I learned to love it all.
After a while, I began to think that I'd only dreamed Scotland...
...that I'd go on forever playing in the garden...
...learning French, studying, hearing music...
...talking to four wise old men who were my uncles.
One of them was the cardinal of Lorraine.
I liked him best.
He was always telling me I'd marry the son of the King of France when I grew up.
That seemed silly.
He was just a boy.
We used to fight, and then I'd chase him, and he'd run away.
Aye, I was in France when you married him.
I've never forgotten, all the pomp and ceremony...
...and the great crowd before the cathedral...
...and the pages carrying your long train.
You weren't even old enough to be out of short dresses.
I was 16.
It was just an arrangement.
And then, one day...
...his father was killed in a tournament.
And everyone made a great fuss over me.
And I was Queen of France.
But before I could realize it all...
...he died, too, poor boy.
And then I was queen no longer.
And then I came back to my old dream...
...to Scotland.
I was never in love.
You know that.
Amen.
So she summons old Scotland to take up arms for her?
Will they come?
Only a rabble of moss-troopers from the border...
...where Bothwell's strength lies.
Mercenaries.
They won't stand up and fight.
- Where's the child?
- Abducted by Moray.
They'll not harm her son.
Moray's strength depends on making him king...
...and ruling as regent till he comes of age.
The lords have won most of Scotland to their cause by convincing John Knox...
...that Bothwell and the queen murdered Darnley...
...to get him out of their way.
Knox thunders it into the people.
And after all...
...what greater proof of their guilty love than this reckless marriage?
And I believed I'd failed.
We shall soon know, Your Majesty.
The lords are marching on Edinburgh...
...and they outnumber
Bothwell's defenders five to one.
Open your gate for the hosts of the righteous!
Oh, my people...
...into what pit of abomination have you fallen?
'Tis not the true banner of Scotland that you follow...
...but the blood-red banner of murder and treason!
Remember, a king of Scotland cries out from his grave to be avenged!
And will you defend his murder, Bothwell?
And will you defend a guilty queen?
Open the gates for the host of the righteous!
Open the gates!
Are you afraid, Mary?
Yes, terribly. Terribly.
That's not my Mary.
I'm only afraid for you.
Then you're not afraid at all.
Flag of truce!
Bowing comes with a bad grace from traitors.
We are not in arms against you, my sister...
...only him.
Before you state your conditions,
Moray...
...I'll state mine.
We'll decide the issue by single combat between you and me.
Or anyone else you and the other traitors wish to appoint.
No, they'll find some way to trick you.
Hear Moray's conditions.
I beg you, madam.
I beg you, sir.
You owe it to the queen.
Go ahead. What are they?
- First, that you leave Scotland forever.
- No.
What else?
That the queen bind herself to act only with our consent.
- No more?
- No more.
Then here are my conditions!
You've wanted my earldom.
Well, you may have it.
I'll leave Scotland...
...if you'll pledge your word...
...that the queen's to keep her throne and reign here as before.
But if you break your word...
...or encroach one inch on her sovereignty...
...you guard your gates, for I'll be back.
I'll see if your terms are acceptable to my lords.
Let me live or die at your side.
I'm your wife.
- I love you.
- I love you, my Mary.
What do I lose? Nothing.
You save your throne.
What's my throne?
I'd put a torch to it for any one of the days
I've had with you.
- They've been so few.
- Aye, but wonderful days, Mary.
Twenty wonderful days.
- Better than a lifetime.
- Take me with you.
No, no. You're Queen of Scotland.
That's your destiny.
And I'll love you till the day I die.
That's mine.
Well, Moray?
The lords of Scotland accept your terms.
Very well.
I wouldn't trust Ruthven's pledge or Morton's...
...but after all, corrupt as you are, you're a Stuart, the son of a king.
I'll take your word as a Stuart.
But remember, Moray...
...if you break your pledge...
...if you ever raise your hand against her,
I'll be back.
Donal!
I'll say it to her milk-white face.
Pluck down the murderers!
Pluck down this contaminator of men!
If there's to be a council here, send out this raving maniac!
Though you be a queen and have faith in thy gods and idols...
...yet in this night of reckoning, they shall not avail thee.
Moray, I demand his removal.
Why don't you answer me?
You shall have to leave your palace.
- That's at my choice, not yours.
- Not now.
I'm still your queen.
You gave your word that I should rule as before.
That's impossible now.
Now...
...I see your treachery.
You not only betray your sovereign...
...you betray yourselves, your own pledge.
- We defend Scotland!
- Aye!
You may remain here if you'll sign what we dictate.
And what do you dictate?
Your abdication.
And you consent to have your son crowned king.
And appoint me regent till he comes of age.
I refuse.
- We'll change your mind.
- Remember Bothwell's warning.
- He'll come back.
- With his army disbanded?
And the price of 1000 crowns on his head?
So long as I live...
...no power on earth shall take my throne away from me.
Come, lock me up.
I'll bide my time and wait for Bothwell.
Milord Throckmorton, ambassador to Scotland.
What news from Scotland?
- Bothwell has been defeated.
- Was he taken?
No, Your Majesty.
He escaped to Denmark...
...where he hopes to raise arms and money for a final blow against Moray.
But I have more important news for you.
The son of Mary Stuart has been crowned king...
...and Moray rules again as regent.
- Then she's abdicated.
- So Moray claims.
- She's still in prison?
At Lochleven. I've seen her.
She asks for Your Majesty's support of her cause against the rebels...
...and asks that you remember that if you favor rebellion in Scotland...
...you may eventually see it in England.
"Rebellion. "
How I hate that word.
Remember, Your Majesty...
...your security depends upon her being behind bars.
But can I support rebellion...
...so near to my own throne?
Remember that.
Neither can I afford to take sides, so long as Bothwell lives.
If Moray's plans succeed...
...he will be caged in Denmark for good, on some pretext or other.
Return to Scotland.
Tell Moray that in the eyes of the world, he is a rebel, a traitor!
- Therefore, I shall oppose him publicly...
- Your Majesty...
...yet support him privately.
And Mary Stuart?
Give her this ring...
...as a token of my friendship and support.
- But she will ask...
- I know what she will ask.
And we'll put her off. Procrastinate.
Months. Years.
There's security in that.
I won't say I wasn't frightened...
...when you tapped at the door before daylight like a bird blown in off the sea.
Go and sit down, ma'am.
It's poor victuals for fine folks...
...but it's all we've got, and you're welcome to it.
I have a little boy like you.
Does he sit in a highchair too?
He wants to know if he sits in a highchair too.
Oh, yes...
...in a very high chair.
For what we are about to receive, may the Lord make us truly thankful.
Amen.
Thomas, who's that?
Your Majesty.
You come from Elizabeth?
Yes, Your Majesty. I've come to conduct you to a place of security.
I thank Her Majesty.
I stand in need of her friendship now.
Thank you, my kind friend.
This will be your apartment,
Your Majesty.
Sir Francis Knollys...
...your host.
Thank you. Thank you.
How wonderful to be free again.
Where is Elizabeth?
Am I to see her now, at last?
I want to thank her. Where is she?
I place this lady in your custody, sir.
Custody?
What do you mean?
England has no jurisdiction over me.
I asked Elizabeth for refuge.
She promised it.
Am I a prisoner?
I demand an answer!
- It's only the storm, sir.
- Listen, Donal.
It's my pipers. They're coming, I tell you!
- Lie down, sir, please, you're sick.
- No, Donal, they're marching up, man!
We'll win yet!
I thought I heard...
Sir, lie down, please.
Open up here!
Open up here! Open up!
Still out of his mind, eh? These Scotsmen have the power of the devil in them.
Prison fever's a good match for the devil.
Open up here!
Open up!
Sir, you're not yourself.
Please lie down, sir.
Now, Donal, I'm getting out.
I'll get out tonight.
Tonight, I tell you!
There it is again. You hear?
What, sir?
The pipes, Donal.
Listen.
Donal, go to England.
Find her, tell her I'm out.
I'm free. I'll free her too.
Tell her... Tell her she'll hear the pipes when I come to her.
Tell her to listen.
Tell her my pipers... My pipers...
My pipers are coming.
Sir. Sir.
Speak. Speak to Donal, sir.
My laddie, my laddie.
What's wrong with him?
You cannot hurt him now.
Aye...
...he spoke true.
He's free.
Bring in the prisoner.
Am I to see Elizabeth at last?
Her Majesty is present, symbolically.
The accused will be seated.
I prefer to stand...
...symbolically.
Do you acknowledge the jurisdiction of this court?
Not of this court, nor of Elizabeth.
There are no examples of sovereigns condemned by courts of law.
In Rome, the tetrarch Cajetanus was put to death by a trial.
There is another precedent.
Licinius, brother-in-law of the emperor Constantine.
Not to forget Joanna of Naples.
You go back 1500 years?
Go back to Pontius Pilate, who condemned to the cross...
...a sovereign greater than the world has ever known.
And remind Elizabeth what happened to the memory of Pontius Pilate.
Please remember that you are the accused.
Accused?
Of what?
Of attempting to take the life of our sovereign lady...
...the Queen of England.
I have lain in prison...
...ever since I came to this land.
Even had I wished it, how could I make such an attempt?
By conspiring with certain English subjects of your religious persuasion...
...to wit, Anthony Babington.
A true friend who sought only to release me from unjust imprisonment.
Where is he?
Executed for treason.
And his friends?
Executed for treason.
Poor, generous friends.
So the first step to prove me guilty...
...is to murder those who would prove me innocent?
The accused will confine herself to answering questions, not framing them.
I am the accuser here...
...not the accused.
I accuse Elizabeth of treachery and plotting against my life...
...not I against hers.
Do you deny secretly communicating with the aforesaid Anthony Babington?
Do any of you deny that you would try to escape from unjust imprisonment?
Do you know what it means to be shut up from everything you love...
...from your husband...
...your son, your own people...
...confined like an animal...
...until each day grows so long that it seems a lifetime?
Yes, I smuggled out letters.
Isn't it true that you approved a plot against the life of our queen?
As true as to say that you are honest men.
Isn't this written in your own handwriting?!
The way you shout, milord, tells me...
...even at this distance, that it is a forgery.
Will you confine yourself to answering questions?
I have heard no questions...
...only accusations phrased like questions.
But why prolong this mockery?
Elizabeth, fearing there might be a real plot to take her life and put me on her throne...
...has invented a false plot so that I may be condemned to death.
But, still, she fears to spring her trap because of Bothwell.
She knows he wins support for my cause abroad.
And when he returns this time...
...he'll carry the field in Scotland, and I'll be queen again.
While he lives, I'll live.
Bring in the other prisoner.
Your Majesty.
Donal.
I tried my best to reach you, ma'am...
...but I couldn't get past your jailer.
And I was taken.
Donal...
...where is he?
Where's Bothwell?
No.
No.
He... He spoke of you at the last, ma'am.
He said...
He said he'd be waiting for you...
...with the bagpipes playing.
And all the time...
...you knew.
Now I see.
Now I understand.
Condemn me.
Kill me.
I don't care.
Ten of the clock, and all's well!
All's well.
All's well.
Strengthen me as thou alone can strengthen.
Comfort me in this, the hour of my agony...
...and may thy will be done.
Elizabeth.
I've only seen a poor likeness.
But, yes...
...you are Elizabeth.
At last.
Aye.
A Stuart.
I see now why men love you.
Even now...
...standing where I am, my last night in this world...
...I wouldn't change places with Elizabeth.
I might've known you'd come...
...to gloat like this.
Stealthily...
...under cover of night...
...as you've done everything to destroy me.
And you've done nothing to destroy me?
- When was I your enemy?
- Always.
- Always, your life was a threat to mine.
- How? Why?
You were born too close to my throne.
It was you or I.
A knife planted between my shoulders...
...and my kingdom was yours.
I never wished it.
But you'd have taken it if it came.
Ah, yes.
You're not even a woman.
I'm a queen.
You've been a woman.
See where it's brought you.
It has brought me happiness you'll never know, Elizabeth.
I wouldn't give up the memory of one day with Bothwell...
...for a century of your life.
What do you know of my life?
You were born a queen.
Honors, thrones...
...everything fell into your lap.
What do you know of the struggle for power?
I started with nothing...
...robbed even of a name, not acknowledged by my father.
My own mother, yes, Anne Boleyn...
...was executed.
And I learned how a woman may be a queen one day...
...and stand on the scaffold the next.
I was sent to the tower by my own sister.
I know what prisons are...
...being threatened month after month with execution.
I died a thousand times.
But I fought my way upward...
...inch by inch...
...until I wore the crown.
I gave my love to no men...
...but to my kingdom, to England.
And you prate to me of love.
What do you know of my life?
I know it's been a failure, a magnificent failure.
It's you who failed, not I.
You threw away a kingdom for love.
For Bothwell.
Aye.
And I'd do it again a thousand times.
You were always afraid of me.
You're afraid of me still.
You know my blood will stain you.
You'll never wash it off.
And the pity of it is, Elizabeth...
...that you and I...
...we might have been friends.
Do you think I want your death?
- Mary Stuart, save yourself.
- How?
Renounce your Stuart claim to my throne.
- Sign your name to it.
- Still driven by fear.
Fear of me even dead.
- So that's why you came here tonight.
- Renounce your claim and live.
You've always loved power, cherished it fiercely.
I've loved as a woman loves, lost as a woman loses.
But, still, I win.
You have no heir.
My son will inherit your throne.
My son will rule England.
Still, still, I win!
Your Majesty...
...it is time.
Your Majesty...
...it is time.
Even...
Even as thine arms were spread upon the cross...
...so receive me into the arms of mercy.
And forgive me my sins.

THE HISTORY OF LOUIS PASTER
THE OFFICE OF A DOCTOR IN PARIS
Doctor or waitress is waiting for you
Okay, a moment.
- Dr. Fravasau?
- Yeah.
- Murder!
- No, justice!
- How did he offend you?
- Kill my girlfriend.
With his hands dirty caused a fever.
Postpartum fever.
You can not blame yourself a doctor for it.
Take it! Read this!
"DOCTORS! SURGERY!"
Wash your hands.
Boil your tools.
Microbes can cause illness yet...
"to your patients. Luy Pasteur."
Who is he?
There is a threat to science.
The death of Dr. Fravasu is proof of it.
Allow Pasteur to continue... will make medical practice safe, for us doctors in France.
You have read all the brochure.
Luis Pasteur.
He's not a doctor, he's a simple chemist.
Are you a chemist? Do not tell me!
You remember a few years ago, which had created a controversy... for Wood Wine?
I remember.
He claimed that small animals were inside.
Little monsters.
But were there such creatures?
Majesty, microorganisms have been observed for a long time.
They are revealed in their own environment... where sepsis occurs.
This is the result and not the cause of illness.
After he had warmed the wine at the right temperature...
Mr Pasteur was able to destroy them.
I think, he plans to heal the poisoning of blood... in the same way.
Baptizing our blood.
God save us!
It is not unwise, I assure you!
I will not get it, Sarboeve.
We are not in the Middle.
Here is France, Paris!
19th century.
I think it should be allowed in Mr. Pasteur to retreat.
- But, Majesty...
- I read, and the brochure.
He does not say anything about boiling blood.
Just boil the tools that you have your surgeons are being used.
Grandmother, if I did something like that
I do not think I can boil my tools... or to wash my hands, I would say that I am a magician and I resort to spells.
That would be an accident.
Most people who go to the hospitals are throwing out deadheads.
Truth Sarmover, why?
For criminal indifference our microbes... and the power to invade the bloodstream... causing high susceptibility at childbirth... three out of ten mothers.
Or in the city of Paris, 20,000 people, innocent women a year.
This is the situation, gentlemen, would you like to decide... who will say, murderer? I know what you're gonna do.
"We want proof! Proof!".
Tell the dead who died... it is not proof of their stupidity!
Ma Lou, you can not be sure!
You have not found the microbe.
Plates show something?
58 tests. All negative.
Your;
There is something here with small changes.
To see you.
According to Zachserst... there has never been a case of fever in a vogue... unless the doctor or the midwife...
I had recently been in touch with other victims of the disease.
- What is your opinion?
- Nothing definitive.
- Try again.
- Yeah?
And, yes, it is.
Remember our goal:
Find the germ, kill the germ.
Mother; - Yes, Avvet?
Someone at the door.
- Who is he?
- I do not know. I did not look ..
The service of His Majesty the Emperor of France... a letter to Mr. Pasteur.
He is not here, sir.
No; And who is that?
Mr Pasteur.
"By order of the Emperor
Luis Pasteur..." is called in the palace.
"The trolley will be shipped at 8pm."
The emperor! I will
I could convince her!
No thanks.
Avvet must rush to prepare the surprise.
- Can I help you?
- We'll all help, dear.
This is not the palace!
A lie I stopped. A moment.
My wife is very sick.
The doctor warned me.
Louise!
You're not going to do anything for that.
He's in a coma for two days.
- Positive fever?
- Undoubtedly.
What a shame.
It is a Divine Prophecy.
Provoia? No.
The fuck!
Going to another patient?
Yes sir.
In the Deveville Forvoil with Dr. Sarbowe.
Please use a clean one.
Sarmobee!
- Sarmover!
- Your Majesty!
I have a surprise for you.
- Who do you think he is here?
- I'm curious, who?
Pasteur!
Pasteur, in the palace?
Yes, I called.
The emperor has never seen a germ.
He is very cautious.
He will honor me, staring these dialects...
Mr Pasteur, call you.
How can and does this device handle?
The Empress.
To see you.
Oh, that?
Come on, Pasteur, tell us what you're up to.
Sir, the Paris hospitals are infected.
You can hardly find a doctor in the city that does not bring the death... in his hands and organs.
Because of the microbes?
Your private collection with invisible animals?
Exactly.
Dr Sabboeve would see if he was looking at his microscope.
Multiply in millions of murderers.
They are fascinated in the soil.
Bavouv in Paris, this evening... and tomorrow I can take my life a mother from this Court.
Help!
Think of being human can be destroyed... from an animal 10,000 times less than a fleece.
It's like an army of ants... to destroy its empire
His Majesty.
Sir, a young woman, a wife a palace officer.
He died here tonight.
Victim of your fantasy.
Do you hesitate to blame me for fear?
But it does not end there. The midwife who watching her... will bear the lead in the next and more subtle sickness... the Covenant Gabriel De Wilford.
Stop! You should know!
The Gabriela Cole is the sister of the Majesty.
I forbid you to go on.
- Mr Pasteur is compelling...
- Please, dear...
Majesty, I...
It is not true that you are the author of a booklet... which talks about your own life a famous doctor... and practice the same method of medicine?
I do not practice medicine.
I try to stop the negligence those who practice it.
The preservation of wine and beer was useful in France.
Appreciate.
In the future, limit your work to that.
It is my wish.
Or better... order!
But if you have other theories... first you will be presented at the Academy of Medicine.
Who is the right guardian?
Of national health.
Sir, and the brochure he wrote?
As for the brochure, you'll get it... or you will suffer my dissatisfaction.
Allow me, I'm Savage Martel, a doctor and a surgeon...
Graduate of the French Institute...
Doctor of Sorovav, Secretary of the Hygienic... and a member of the Lazur
International Union.
I am convinced there is some truth to what you say.
You honor me.
Sramboe is not understood when it's something new...
Syndrome. Are not you helping Dr. Darwin?
I guess I'm.
It is your duty to respect you and do not ridicule it.
I, sir?
Goodnight.
Comes, it's coming!
The light of candles, fast!
The light of candles!
Stop it.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
Tomorrow, prepare the suitcases.
We leave Paris tomorrow.
French-Prussian War.
I saw the girls fighting and interlocutors...
Pasteur was fighting the germs... the true enemy of humanity.
Napoleon, 3rd Emperor of France.
Luis Adolfo Tier.
First President of the French Republic.
He knows the conditions under which Bismarck you are... to withdraw the German army from France.
Apart from the loss of Alsace and Lorayev...
We have to pay a sum of damages
5 billion francs.
The question is, how will you find such an amount?
Our industries have stopped... farms have been neglected... a devastating doll destroyed our cattle.
That will cost us millions of francs a year.
Therefore, efforts to find cash failed to hit... except for a small province of the Arboise region.
If Arboa can break down economically, why not others?
For some reason, it was not influenced by the doll.
- Is Dr. Rayvis true?
- I do not know, sir.
If there is no illness of cattle in Arbua... it is our duty to know the word.
Maybe they found a way to avoid them.
All farmers have a "cure" for the Carbon Virus.
The Academy of Sciences has heard thousands.
Well, what is your opinion?
For this phenomenon?
Sometimes, some animals happen to have the strength.
Arbua looks very lucky.
These are simple speculations.
I suggest you do it an exhaustive inquiry right away.
France is in a desperate situation.
Your resources must be pumped to the maximum.
Any animal that can be saved... will again buy the freedom of France... and self-esteem.
They really do not look sick.
Luck, that's all. Pure luck!
Let's ask a few questions to this boy.
Come please.
Hello, eh.
I have spent some of your animals from coal in recent times?
- Carbon? What is this?
- The black penguin.
The black penguin? I had once, but no longer.
As I had seen it.
These fields have the power.
But how Doctor? Why;
Come on, that's out of there knowledge of science.
Whenever you ask "how" or "why?"
I have to refer you to the theologian.
When the sheep were sick... your uncle did something to help them?
He could not help the sick.
But there is one man that makes the others not to get sick.
- Like those.
- What man?
Do you see the house comfortably on the bridge?
She lives there.
Syndrome.
I'm Savage Martel, I gave Dr. Rabbit... chief and president of Georgia of the new Republic.
Visitors!
What are these benefits?
- Sir?
- What are you doing with the sheep?
It is the black velvet that is caused from the carbohydrate virus.
What thing;
The microbe, the microorganism which causes the carbon.
Did you hear this Martel?
The micro-organism.
We sent to Arbua to discover... the reason that your sheep
I escaped the plague.
You are welcome, sir.
My name is Avvet.
Avvet Pasteur.
Do you...?
My father will be glad to see you.
Not Louis Pasteur, this chemist!
Father!
Louie, where are you? You did not promise me to rest?
I will immediately return my dear.
Have you ever been the savior of the sheep?
Very interested.
He was responsible for his death
Dr. Fravasu. Remember;
He was deported from Paris.
- Not exactly.
- Do not refuse it.
You were forbidding to practice medicine.
You are never a prophet without his followers.
But she was so smart.
These animals know their good.
Tell me, then. I'm afraid.
I'm afraid it's useless, but I'll try.
Rou.
Will you explain to Dr. Rabbit what we do?
He is a member of the Academy of Medicine.
You should use it a very simple language.
We are convinced, after eight years of experiments... that the vaccine when injected within the animal, creates anxiety.
Ridiculous! It will take 80 years to convince me!
80; Are you a little hopeful?
You're wasting your money.
But I do not pay. You are donating.
Come on, Martel. I heard enough!
Will you come;
- No, I will.
- Go!
Yet, do you care about yours?
I thought you did not remember me, sir.
I remember you. In the night at the palace.
When I told the emperor that I will die.
You were right. I'm sorry. And Sharbove never forgave you.
Why do you live?
I'm no longer a courtier.
I'm working for the government.
My job is to help farmers in France.
If you do not mind...
Avvet - Yes, father?
Ask your mother if we have space for a visitor.
I'm sure we have. I want to say...
I'm going to know.
You want to give your country a real service?
Yes I want.
Fine. Come with me.
This should be of interest to you.
Here we have his full story bacillus of coal... in a way that even you unable to understand.
For example, this transcendence shows inactive bacteria or seeds, which are located in soils where
I had buried sick animals.
In this condition, the microbe falls in marsh like the caterpillar in the cocoon... and it remains inanimate for years, but... at the time these organisms in a European environment... like hot sheep's blood... change the shape immediately... and are grown in large chains such as these.
Amazing!
Let's look at the blood now a healthy animal.
Affected before microorganisms.
These living cells, as we find them... to a healthy sheep.
How do you get the spores?
Into the blood?
It dies with the grass eating the creature.
But we found that the spores were mutated in... in fully developed microbes... productive and satirical.
Here we have the blood to a sick animal.
This time with carbon bark.
Mark the bars that you have are found between the cells.
This is the accuser, in whose fight we are.
At this stage, the animal is condemned to die.
Once buried, the microbe is not active... and it becomes seed.
Over the years, they are released into the ground... the air gets them through the dust and polluvvv the grass.
Thus, the pestilence is re-infected.
And you say these ones seeds are even there?
In each acre I checked.
The only reason our cattle are still healthy, is my vaccine.
For an animal that has not been vaccinated...
Arbua is one of them worst areas across France.
AGRICULTURAL NEWSPAPER
IMPORTANT NOTICE
"There is no coal in Arbua."
Dr. Ravic says."
The government will give large area for grazing.
Rabbit asks the farmers to bring healthy sheep... in Arbou, at the expense of the state.
To Armbous 35 km.
To Armpus, 22 km.
Where do these sheep pass?
I do not know.
Find out where they're going.
What is this?
Look! Rabbi is responsible for this.
State land. State land.
- This is unforgivable stupidity.
- We have to stop them.
Stop. Stop.
Stop!
We do not let the sick sheep...
- Just healthy.
- I'm gonna let you down.
The fields are not safe.
They are busy.
I represent the government.
I checked these fields and it's safe.
But it is wrong.
We will prove it is not!
Stop it.
Go back.
It can even affect healthy ones.
I saw with my eyes what Pasteur can do.
And what did she do for sheep?
And the cattle of Arbua.
We, the members of the Academy, did not do anything... for the fight against coal.
So why not listen a man who conquered?
Pasteur has been proven to be you tartlatavos, 10 years ago... when he made funny claims as to the cause of morbidity at birth.
Claims he could not prove. I see no reason to deal with him any more.
I'm afraid. If someone has a cure for the coal, I want to know it.
And I!
The members of the gallery, please silence.
- Dr. Rabbit.
- Thank you.
I just want to ask a question:
Dr. Martel's purpose is to help science... or love? I think the second.
After I knew the beautiful one daughter of Dr. Pasteur.
I do not blame the old colleague who wants to become his son-in-law.
I'm protesting, I'm here because
I think Pasteur is right.
I know he's right.
And it will spare you for them efforts you make for this.
Dr. Rosville.
Friends, colleagues, I suggest experiment to free us... from the trickster Luis Pasteur.
In my workshop I discovered how I can to burn coal to healthy sheep... by injecting them into the blood sheep, which has already been infected by the virus.
This always leads to death.
Let's get 50 healthy sheep.
The 25 will be vaccinated by Mr Pasteur, and the other 25 will remain as they have.
Then I will infect all 50 sheep with the method I just explained.
And I challenge any person or person vaccine to save one of these.
Thanks.
Paternally, Pasteur would not be able to try this out.
He would not dare!
Dr Martel!
Otherwise, I can not get...
If things are like you say...
Let it prove it!
I challenge them to try!
I accept!
THESE PROVES ARE
WATCHES FROM THE LOUIS PASTER.
Mr Pasteur.
Thank you.
THESE PROBATES WERE NOT ENVISAGED.
Dr. Rosville, a moment, please.
Only Dr. Rosalol please.
This is the last one.
If you wait for me, we'll go home together.
Do not you have to go down here?
No, they are to them the rules of the experiment.
Then, and dad can to come with us?
Yes.
After you inoculated the 25 animals with your magic vaccine, you still say how do we have?
Correctly.
I can inject their blood into them of an animal that died of carbon.
If you do, doctor.
But it is awkward present yourself to all.
- It is easier to use the microbe.
- Who said nothing about germs?
But what do you think it is the carbon?
Carbon is created inside the body.
It does not come from an external source.
So why do you infuse anything?
Why do not you let it be created?
Lord, you will follow them the rules of the experiment... or will you admit your defeat?
Go ahead, do not hesitate, doctor.
I just thought...
Many things you think, that's your problem!
- We're ready, Doc.
- He went on.
You could make a statement to the Times of Lodviv, and Pasteur?
The sheep, without my own treatment will be burned out of coal, in 48 hours.
The others will not be ill, I suppose.
I hope not. For the sake of France.
"NEW EXPERIENCE AT POULIER OF FORM".
FERTILIZERS AND SCIENTIFIC SURVIVERS.
For tomorrow the Pasteur experiment.
There is a lot of people in Puy-les-Forres.
Sure Pasteur for success.
At the end of the microbe and their high priest, Louis Pasteur.
Try not to worry Lu.
I should have been down.
I should not leave it.
There's Roe there.
Besides, Dr. Rosville said they are in line with the rules.
Can you?
Luke, do you realize what this means?
Tomorrow, if you are successful... every farmer in Europe he will want your vaccine.
You will not be quiet.
The benefits of science are not for scientists Marie.
It's about humanity.
Otherwise, Rosalol or
Pasteur, who will win?
Rosville, he is a member of the Academy.
I think Mr. Pasteur will win.
Please, a moment!
- There is a lot of people.
- It's amazing.
People are coming from all over Europe.
For the acrobats or other performance.
These agricultural artifacts it's in the flies... the slightest crowd attracts them.
- Thank you sir.
- Dr. Lister, a moment!
Letter! Nice, very nice.
The guy would like a statement.
Letter, amazing!!
- What brings you here?
- The same reason that you too.
How are you; How are you;
It's coming. Luis Pasteur.
- Acknowledge, after you.
- No, after you.
- No, after you.
- No, after you.
Why don't you...?
PROVENTS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN IMPROVED.
Dead - Pasteur was right.
For now, let's see now what she vaccinated.
Do not you die, eh?
You could not convince me.
Everything is life-like and healthy, as you predicted.
Roo! Roo!
Dear friend!
Mr Pasteur!
Mr Pasteur!
Mr Pasteur!
Mr Pasteur!
Let me give you the hand.
Father, I'm so glad.
And I'm so proud, my dear.
- Avvet!
- Damn, is not it wonderful?
Finally, sir, you are a triumph!
For my one boy. Congratulations!
Father, Zav has something to tell you.
Let me ask.
K, Pasteur, what I wanted to say is...
I hear.
From my arrival to Armpus...
I have known you and your family very well.
- And... Mr. Pasteur...
- Yeah, then, then?
I feel...
Father, Zav is trying ask for my hand.
Yes, we want to scream.
Well, I was hoping for it.
K, Pasteur, congratulations!
It does not seem possible.
How can it be alive?
I can not understand.
It's easy to understand.
Pasteur was right, and we were wrong.
The vaccine takes on the carbon.
We have a big glimpse of ours.
I agree.
I can predict marvelously benefits for the world... especially in the field of surgery.
Why do not you say that to Pasteur himself?
I will be happy. I want to meet it.
It's there. Syndrome.
Sorry.
Look at these eyes, health bulbs.
Pasteur, if I'm skeptical,
I ask you to forgive me.
- It's a miracle.
- Thank you.
Dr. Lister wants you to meet you.
He came from England.
It is my honor to be over.
The price is mine, doctor.
I am familiar with your work in the anti-septic.
Thanks to you and your brilliant leadership.
This is the glory.
Lissasser dog!
Lissasser dog!
Let's go to the witch.
Look, that's one, ten out of ten.
It contains two and three, and all four will be.
Five and six a real curse.
Seven seven, and eight, and it's over.
And there is a new one and the ten is nothing.
And this is a fortune that has come from the witch.
Not all doctors in Europe could do more for this.
He will be lucky if he does not get sick.
But if we could find the cause.
The cause of rabies.
Therefore, we would have a cure.
There must be a way.
PARIS. A year later.
Mother!
Avvet, such time?
Why is not Zav?
He works with the father.
- But he's my dick!
- He has not forgotten it.
Science, science.
Everything is science.
I will have a child.
Does not he realize this?
At your age, I also had children but I did not cry about it.
Yes, but how much did you survive?
Avvet!
I am sorry.
I want to see Dad!
I want to talk to him.
You will be unhappy with it.
Are not you coming?
You know how much it is a dream.
Where's Mr. Pasteur?
We can not bother it now.
What is it?
It's for the veterinarian.
Here you go. I will talk to him.
It does not work.
Nothing works.
We follow it process with the carbon.
This shows how little we know about illnesses.
Nature is a lot complicated to recapture.
My dear love.
You are in the middle of an experiment.
- I did not mean to bother you.
- It's okay, my love.
Go back, dad you may need it.
- I'll get you home.
- I do not need, I have a carriage.
Be careful all of you.
So far we have not been able to find the germ causing germs.
But our experiments I showed it.
Listen carefully.
As soon as the vet comes to get...
Where's Martel?
Excuse me a moment.
- Good night, my love.
- Good night.
Goodnight.
I am coming.
Where are they? What are you doing?
- Avvet was here.
- The Avvet?
- How are they?
- Good.
It's 11 o'clock, what's going on with your dinner?
- Just a minute.
You said the same three hours ago and you did not eat anything.
We all need the dinner, I guess.
Okay, tell them to stop.
But we go on again in half an hour.
Cesile, the dinner.
Hello. Please.
He's the owner. Open the door.
Luy, I have a letter for you.
He came from England.
Dr. Lister. To see you.
- First food.
- But that's important.
All right. I will read it.
"Dear Sir..." my observations lead me to the conclusion that you are miserable.
What;
You tell me that you treat your slaves as slaves... neglected by your wife, you mistreat your family...
Oh, Marie, it's not time for jokes.
Not until you eat. I'll tell you what he says.
"Dear Pasteur...".
This is different.
"Your recent report on the indescribable causes of mourning..."
It is immaculate in every detail.
Forgive the honesty that our love for science...
I'm afraid. Greetings.
My colleagues in Brussels and in Prague said that... their hospitals are safe at a fast pace.
"Mothers can go there without fear."
There we have to send the Avvet for generating.
These doctors of Paris!
He says more.
"I do not hesitate to resolve you as the most precious... that has entered the space of the science."
- What is it?
- Nothing Marie.
This dog! I have a rabid dog!
Open his mouth.
I want to get as much more possibilities.
Stable now.
Luke, stop! This is rabies!
Mary, I swear to find a cure!
I can not stop now.
Not before I free the world from this lifeless illness.
THE PASSER IS EMPLOYED TO
THE SHOW OF THE SOLUTION
He claims that the disease is due in a sanitizing microbe.
Mr Pasteur refuses to attend in our conferences... but it continues to be abused the credibility of human beings.
Fill the columns the papers with his theories.
And the carbon inoculum?
This was not a theory.
It's a fact. Not only did the Academy accept it... but helped the poor our farmers... to collect enough money for you the entire Franco-Prussian War was filled.
Part of French science.
Science is attacking the word.
I am here to defend you the price of French medicine... according to the tricks of a torturer.
He is right.
Dr. Zarahov.
I am russian. I came up with a different purpose.
With the authorization of my government to explore Pasteur's work.
His reputation spread among the peasants of my country... which for infected people have been infected by raging wolves.
I spent my life studying rabies, or hydrophobia... and gentlemen, I will bring... whichever man manages to find healing.
I guess the microbes is the cause of rabies... or any other illness.
Dr. Sarbowe, how do we know how the bacteria are not harmful?
How do we know it is not their life... as Pasteur claims?
If Pasteur does not come to us, we will go to Pasteur.
To put us down, you, me.
And the whole Academy?
Humility is a virtue.
Not just in the way, but also in those who hope to heal it.
Okay, let's go.
Let's see what he can teach us this great dick.
Thank you my lady.
Better that.
Fortunately we found you.
It is the desire of others honored by the Academy of Sciences.
To Honor Me?
Quickly.
Dr. Zarahov has read your statements in the newspaper.
- How are you doctor?
- Sir.
You promise to cure rabies.
The guy gets freedoms.
As always, my remarks they were too much of them.
In other words, there is none basis for such a prediction?
Base; - Evidence.
- Not yet.
- I do not think so.
What a mess!
In your last article at
Magazine of the Academy...
You said you were in the threshold of a new world.
Did you pass this threshold?
Science is one step, and then one more.
At last it stops and depicts before proceeding.
The mother takes the baby lets go down and tells him, walk.
The child makes the first step and then the other.
Then it stops with instability.
Would the mother be right if he told him, do you hesitate?
You will never walk.
Turn off this pipe.
They dirty the place.
You said...
Step by step, I end up to the conclusion... that microbes are the cause all of the patients.
How ridiculous!
If you are still skeptical.
The microbes... it's still a myth for you, listen.
A drop of the rabies virus it can kill an enemy.
And I have enough for you
I'm extinguishing a city.
Ridiculous!
To see if he can to kill a man!
Stop!
The only thing that is, is you predictions at the time of my life.
KNOWLEDGE SURGERY CREATING DEATH
Rabies are not caused from germs, says Sarbowe... making a suggestion to reject it the Pasteur theory.
It's been a month, and still be in good condition.
Truth; - I saw yesterday.
Truth.
Nato is coming here.
How are you today, Sarbonne.
Wonderful. I have never felt better.
For Pasteur, you ought to be in the tomb.
The more germs I get, the better I feel.
Cesile, please tell your wife, Pasteur that's what Dr. Rosville is here to do.
Yes Madam.
Something must be done.
I just came back from the main road.
Sarbowe ridicules your spouse,
Going down, downstairs.
It keeps the fuck for you attract attention.
And ridicule your P, Pasteur.
Luy does not care about gilding,
If he remembers that he is right, that is the only thing that matters.
Mr Pasteur, I came to you warn about the Sharbove.
You can not leave it to fool you.
Your project is very important.
Significant? I wish you were. It is not.
Not yet. My results they were abusive.
Could not find the microbe?
No indication.
But I was so sure the day here or here.
I still am.
All the animals vaccinated with what the tube had died.
For some reason, Sharbove, he was accused of illness.
I do not know why.
Are you sure it was the same tube?
Absolutely. I was the only sample I had.
He may have been for you long interval.
You once said the microbes with time.
Come on! It may be you!
Rou.
How long did you have the virus which was injected into the Sarbowe?
14 days.
And when it was used last on the cuff?
A week before, I believe.
One week; Are you sure;
A moment. Here's the file.
- 9 days, to be accurate.
- Here's your answer.
It should be!
It is the only possible explanation!
You think because you left to minimize, did you do harmless?
Not harmless but unimportant.
Pretty poor for you overcome the system!
If that's true, it will not help.
When man is biting, he takes, with the full power of the microbe,
- and not attenuated.
- Exactly!
But suppose we start with 14 days... which is not life-threatening.
Suppose we inject it into a healthy animal... and day by day, as nature builds up its resilience... increase the dose, with a stronger and fresh virus... until we can finish it as we know it now.
Will not it be so then?
It was awkward! It will never work!
If the first shot does not kill it, it will be the 2nd or 3rd.
Where are the pipes?
That you have prepared?
Here.
Give me.
It's all in the series. We have dates.
Here we are. 14 days.
- What?
- Yes sir.
- How many dogs do we have?
- Ten.
- Are you ok; Healthy?
- In perfect condition.
- I've never been exposed.
- Give rabies.
- Look...
- Give rabies.
14th day-last results-results.
10 cases from 10-qualifying.
Open the door!
Eat! Eat!
It's all here.
You will all get your share.
If Sarbonne did not... we might not have discovered this treatment.
Kaimee Sarboeve, she barely knows that is our beloved experimental animal.
Luy - Yes, my dear.
Come on, please, your doctor wants to see you.
Do you doctor?
Come on! You're waiting.
K, Pasteur, I'm Dr. Faiffer, an excuse I did not tell you... but we came from Alsace. We;
I'm sorry. Here it is.
You are welcome.
Mrs. Maister The child her is sick.
The boy was bitten by a dog.
I did what I could, but it's not enough.
Aven rabies...
You can help us.
We told you that you can.
Give me your hand, eh. Do not be afraid.
I'm not going to get you.
My boy. My little Joseph.
- How many days before?
- Five days.
Have you burned the wound?
Not immediately. He spent 24 hours.
- Does that mean I'm going to die?
- Of course not!
Little boys do not die.
I have a lot to come by.
This will not live. I know.
Last year, she met at one of our neighbors.
- And now...
- Mother!
Stuck! What has he done?
This with your child?
Save it, save it.
Save it.
Marie, swim in bed and look hot.
Come on. Do not be afraid.
Let's go back. You must you are tired... after such a long journey.
- Mother!
- I am coming baby.
- I am coming.
- Come on.
Are you sure the dog has rabies?
There is no doubt.
I did the test myself.
- Can you do something?
- I do not know. Experiment.
I hope, but...
Ru, get me Dr. Rossville right away.
What does Dr. Rosville mean?
I am sorry.
Given that the death is the the only alternative solution for the boy...
I'm willing to try anything.
Will not you do that Dr. Rosville?
I am sorry. I can not agree.
As much as I admire them
Achievements of Pasteur... when it comes to human life is in danger, I would hesitate... before going to the best possible knowledge of medicine.
Which in this case it means letting the child die.
We do what we can, we have drugs, tranquilizers...
There is a recording of one treatment for rabies.
I do not deny that.
See the acceptable treatment.
Start a new one course is always dangerous... from a professional point of view.
And it will be doubly dangerous since Dr Pasteur is a chemist, not a doctor, and you can not is waiting for medical support.
For the sake of his advice, do not try something wrong.
Good night, gentlemen.
You will not hear it, right?
Do not get me wrong.
The cure saved me 10 dogs.
But I can not fancy what consequences will have on one person.
If I fail, I have to be arrested.
Maybe guillotine.
If you change your mind, please let me know. Goodnight.
Luy, you did not do it...
You will be arrested. You will be arrested!
Sleeps.
- Good morning.
- Good morning lady.
- Anyone from Avvet?
- The time is near.
That's why I wanted to talk to you.
Our doctor is sick.
Leckerle?
- Yeah.
- Louis will find somebody to replace it.
But when it comes to the use of antiseptic...
It's hard to find someone to trust.
Martel.
Yes, Mr. How is the child?
Has fever.
His third conviction became ill.
Who is Ron with him? What are you going to do now?
Do I? It will be the 4th, 5th, 6th.
If you live...
- Is the test over?
- Not yet.
Why not; What happened?
One of the bottles accidentally broke.
Stupid! Wonderful notions.
I have to have it.
- Just do it yourself.
- Very well.
Do not let anything touch it.
You have not closed eye for 48 hours.
There will be time later.
There will not be. This is the problem.
It will continue.
I've been lucky for all my life.
Lucky than I deserved.
- But I do not get it now...
- You will not fail.
The boy will get back.
And then, we'll leave.
We will take a long-term holiday.
Martel, Rou. All of them.
It takes more than that.
How good it was!
How much do you think!
I will never know how much
I am convinced.
- Why do not you tell them?
- I'll do it. I'll do it.
And you're Marie, more than all... what did I do to deserve such devotion?
You remember what you said when you asked me to shout?
You said, I have nothing for you attract a girl... but those who know me very well...
I know I like them.
Did I say that?
- Are we so talkative?
- I knew that very well.
Looking at a mirror when you say that.
Come on, please.
A thousand words about the harassment.
I just arrived from the Russian Embassy.
Look out of the window!
Look.
They are peasants.
Victims of rabid wolves.
My government has sent them to you.
So early?
The treatment of your spouse has spread across the continent.
But it has not yet been proven.
That's why I came. Offer for the experiment.
Pasteur, it's a great opportunity!
It's a great opportunity to kill myself. Kill me.
Long distance away.
Do not let them into a sower.
I am a scientist,
Zarahov, not a magician.
My treatment was for dogs.
But they are crazy.
Pasteur, think.
You will not be denied.
Pasteur!
Pasteur!
Pasteur!
Take them to the hospital.
He has redeemed them.
I want a full report for each case.
Thank you sir.
Thank you. What triumph!
What triumph. Good morning and a thousand relatives.
- Good morning, doctor.
- Lady.
Yes Cecil.
- How is the child?
- The same.
He made his fourth comeback.
Tell the guys not to leave the lab...
Under no treaty. Am I clear?
Maybe I need them, by one moment at the other.
All right.
- What am I going to say on the chariot?
- Is he still here?
- We wait for you at the kitchen.
- One minute.
It's about Avvet and
Dr. Lekler is ill.
- Lekeller sick?
- I'll call the Zv.
Nor a word in the VaV.
- Zav is here.
- She's her husband.
The work he does must be over.
What will we do?
Do not worry. I'll look have the necessary fuel.
- Doctor is here?
- He's in his sickness.
- He will not be back before midnight.
- Midnight?
- Doctor Dr Domiat is inside?
- I'm sorry, sir.
He went to Riviera for
I was vacationing for a month.
On the Riviera, well.
- Will you leave me?
- No, thank you, thank you.
Sarboe, wait. I want to talk to you.
Need help. My daughter is gay.
Wonderful! But why did you come to me?
Dizame Street.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
This is my girlfriend.
It will help you.
- You can rely on her.
- Lady, my honor.
Sarbonne?
Cesile, boil some water.
I'll be back to Avvet.
A large bowl.
You will not use them without burning it.
Of course!
I will not allow it.
It's a professional courtesy.
Do it in my way. Please.
I will do it in your own way.
But we will make an agreement.
Agreement?
"I, Luis Pasteur with me this is what I admit..."
I've been living another month without sticking rabies...
I will have the right to post it to scientific newspapers in Europe.
I know Luis Pasteur that my research... because the cause of rabies was unsuccessful... and without any value...
- You can cook.
- Yes sir.
- Where is the patient?
- You wait. Wash your hands first.
No. Take off your coat.
Lift your maids and wash until the bumps.
What is this?
Do not be afraid. It's just a bactericide.
Use the brush.
Yes, you are in a minute.
- Are you okay?
- Yes, it's better.
There is a clean towel there.
Cesile quickly.
Come on, my daughter is ready.
- Do not touch!
- What;
Your hands! Your hands!
You dirty it. You should again to wash.
I brought hundreds of babies to the world...
Remember our agreement.
You do what I told you.
What is it?
Get up.
And now;
Do not touch anything except the patient.
- My tools?
- He'll be in your hand.
We have a grandson!
Dr. Sarbowe, come on quickly.
My husband is sick!
Had a stroke.
My left side is paralyzed.
Just a little. Nothing serious.
- When did it happen?
- A few days ago.
Few days;
I'm too tired.
Do you feel better;
- How's the kid?
- She's going fine.
Thank God!
And the Russians?
Could you help them?
The hospital has denied our lawsuit without the permission of the Academy.
The license was issued today. Too late.
Three of them lost their lives yesterday.
Worry!
- Let me get up.
- Please, Louis.
I have to go. How many do you have?
19, but it is outrageous.
If our efforts can save us, it is worth the trouble.
Get me up. Dress me up.
What is happening?
Pasteur will deal with the Russians.
But I'm afraid it's too late.
Dr. Sarbowave, why do not you come in?
I do not want to bother it.
Patient No. 1, 3cc.
Sava, Patient No. 2.
Dr. Sarbowe did not thank you... that you defied my scholar.
You are a sick sir, I'm sorry.
Perhaps this note helps to speed up your arrest.
The agreement is an agreement.
I want the cure for rabies.
- How is he today?
- Much better.
That's good.
- Day 9, Patient No. 1.
- No change?
- Not this morning.
- Continuing treatment.
- Eight days of the virus?
- Yeah.
Patient No. 5.
- How are the Russian patients today?
- They're doing very well.
Pasteur will make the final his visit tomorrow.
- Good morning.
- Good morning Cecil.
How is my Joseph?
Well and with great appetite!
Come and see it!
It was over. It was over.
It was over. It was over.
Joseph!
- Here it is!
- What a wreck!
How can we take the gentleman?
I will do it myself.
He would not accept to go, if he suspected it.
He will not suspect it.
Leave it to me.
Mr. Pasteur?
Joseph, are you ready?
It was a moment.
I have a surprise for you get together.
Mrs. Maister wants to thank you once again, come back.
I think you are human that we will always remember.
No no no.
- Crazy.
- Crazy.
- Goodbye, sir.
- Crazy.
Joseph.
- Can you write?
- Yeah.
Would you like to write to me?
Yes very much.
Then let me have you yours every month, can you?
I'll do it.
Do not forget!
I will wait for your letters.
Thank you.
- Crazy.
- Crazy.
By the way, Ro said to me that you are a foreign scientist... will give a lecture at the Academy tonight.
He claims to have proved that all your theories about microbes are wrong.
What; Who is he?
- What's your name?
- I do not know.
Call a coach. I want to go.
You came in the hour.
Courage, my dear.
I will watch from the balcony.
- What a chuckle?
- The speaker. Dr. Lister from England.
The Lister!
Will Lister speak to me?
Ladies and gentlemen...
The price we make in Pasteur at this ceremony... is small compared to hundreds of thousands... which will be in his memory in the future.
Vaccines for the carbon and hydrophobic... are major achievements.
But still bigger the fact that thousands of people... will be saved from unnecessary death of mourning.
And mothers will not be afraid of surgery or childbirth.
In the case of France, I welcome you.
Mr Pasteur, I welcome you on behalf of humanity.
Lister, Big Lister!
From the Imperial Majesty, the Tsar of Russia... with deep gratitude.
I...
I have no words to express myself.
You, the doctors, the doctors and the doctors scientists of the future... do not be seduced by unnecessary skepticism... nor be dismayed by sorrow a few hours... which nourishes the nation.
Do not be angry with your opponents.
There is no scientific theory is acceptable without opposition.
Live in peaceful peace libraries and laboratories.
Ask: "What am I doing?
For my education? ".
And as you progress gradually:
"What am I doing?"
Until the time comes to have you the infinite happiness... think about contributing
Somehow... for prosperity and progress of humanity.
Translation-Performance kortez1976...
The terrible Vladinoffs, they may have a tip.
You know, he used to run horses in Russia before he became minister of interior.
Hello Alexandra.
- Hello.
- What do you backing?
I suppose one really ought to put something on the king's horse.
- How loyal.
- In Russia you always back the tsar's horse?
No, in Russia I genuinely back my father's horse, I do at least know they are trying.
Oh, then you know more about them than I do my dear.
- That's not very difficult Father.
- There's the king's horse.
- There's the king's horse.
- There he goes.
- Hello Fothergill, how did you find your...
- Hello.
Yes, my final visit to England.
I'll I've left on the king's horse.
- How much?
- Five up.
- Good luck.
- Good luck.
I see you've been press correspondent in Russia five years.
- Yes.
- Going back to the same job?
No, this time I'm translating
English novels for a publisher.
- Have no difficulty with the language, eh?
- No, very little in speaking and...
- not much in writing.
- When you leave?
Tomorrow night, chain cross.
Thank you.
Goodbye Alexandra.
And thank you for the lovely flowers, goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Alright Alex, I'm sorry you can't stay for shooting.
Oh thanks, but there's plenty of shooting where I'm going.
- Bear, wolves?
- No, everything, even ministers.
Take a seat, please.
Excuse me sir.
Dinner is served.
Dinner is served.
Why is the dining car always at the other end of the train?
Hold your head up, Countess.
Countess Olga Vesselro.
Princess Nina Volchonsky.
- Is my back all right?
- For the tenth time, yes.
Oh, I know I'm going to faint.
Countess Vera Brastov.
Countess Alexandra Vladinoff.
Daughter of the minister, betrothed to Colonel Adraxine.
Countess.
We congratulate you,
Colonel Adraxine is a very lucky man.
What a lovely child.
Anna Sprohoff.
- What did His Majesty say?
- He congratulate you.
- Colonel Adraxine is a very lucky man.
- And so I am.
And Alexandra is a very lucky girl, aren't you darling?
- Why, of course she is.
- Of course I am.
- I hope it will be a success.
- Of course it will be.
He is the greatest fool in the guard and she is the cleverest girl at court.
Mr. Fothergill.
Some more please,
- Hello Fothergill.
- Hello Stanfield.
- You are in a hurry.
- Yes, I've to go to the police.
The police? Well, are you lunching at the London Tavern?
- I hope so. Sorry, I'm late. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Tyevsky's Route, 40.
- Anyway, you admit you write this article?
- Of course.
It's an attack on the imperial government.
Not an attack, merely an account of the system of government.
In your opinion, if you were
Russian it would mean Siberia.
Your permit to remain in Russia is canceled.
But my whole future is bound up in Russia.
You have 48 hours to get out.
Look here see, you don't realize, I,
I've worked here for years, I love Russia.
I've tried to make the English understand that the Russian outlook...
I'm sorry but I have 23 appointments before lunch.
If everything else fired but it cleared out in 48 hours. 48 hours, two days.
There it is, six years hard work completely chucked away.
- There are other jobs, of course.
- Not in Russia.
- Certainly.
- The police have chucked me out.
- Not if you do the right job.
- Well, what, for instance?
The British Secret Service.
- Be a spy?
- Why not?
You're not afraid of the word, you'd be serving your country.
Wouldn't have to give anyone away, all we want is information.
- Information of what?
- The revolutionary movement.
Now, my job is to recruit young Englishman like yourself... who can speak Russian well enough to pass as Russians.
Go on, what's the catch?
Well, if you're caught, your number is up.
But I, I could claim
British nationality, wouldn't I?
No, you couldn't do that.
If you did tell the truth,
British authorities would... politely disclaim all knowledge of you.
It is a case of, heads they win, tails I lose.
- Bit one-sided, isn't it?
- Well, it's the chance we all take.
The pay is rather good.
Would it interest you?
No, I don't think so.
- Oh, cream please.
- Yes sir.
Well, think it over.
- How do you do Fothergill?
- Good morning.
Pleased to see you, come along.
I'll introduce you to our general manager.
Oh, thanks.
Well, aren't you a bit surprised to see me this morning?
Well, takes a good deal to surprise me, you know.
This way.
But surely the police will be there to see me off the premises, won't they?
Naturally, at the evening, a man carrying your passport will leave Russia.
You collect his luggage at the station and board the night express for Germany.
That's the fellow you got to look like.
- Peter Ouronov, who's Peter Ouronov?
- You are.
That's your name for the future, you'd better memorize it.
And what's Peter Ouronov's first job?
To join the revolutionary movement.
There's a man named
Axelstein, he runs a bookshop..
I've got the pamphlets from Zorin but think the distribution will be difficult.
- You think you can manage?
- I'll do my best.
Ah, it's lovely, beautiful.
Yes, that's the 1840 edition.
Do you seen Maronin today?
No, he ought to have been here half an hour ago.
Hope nothing is happened to him, such a hot head..
- What about this one?
- Yes, that's very good.
- Maronin?
- You know what happened?
For the third time this month, 20 students arrested.
- Yes, 20.
Five of them gassed.
You know what that means?
Exiles in the north and their work stopped.
- Sounds dreadful.
- Yes, you said dreadful.
- What do we do? Nothing.
- No, no, no...
Does anyone ever do anything?
We just talk and talk and talk.
Quiet, you young fool, if you want to talk...
I, I have taken the liberty of telling your Excellency's coachman...
- to go by the Nietshoc Bridge.
- But that's a long way around.
I have to meet my daughter and it's already...
- Fit Your Excellency.
- Pard me Excellency.
- Prudence your Excellency, is essential...
- Prudence?
That your show of police around with him, insights the terrorists.
But I am personally responsible to His
Majesty for your Excellency's life.
- Oh, let's go, let's go.
- If I could...
Do you like it Father?
- Are you happy dear? Really happy?
- Of course dear.
God bless you my darling.
I'll be ready in a few minutes, can I come home with you?
No, not in my carriage, I couldn't risk it.
Not as things are just now.
Hello darling.
It's all too vague, it's no proper plan.
Anyway, we haven't got the package through Norway yet.
- I have enough jelly left for two oranges.
- We need four.
- Maronin is quite sure of himself.
- Oh, his impatience will ruin everything.
Maronin is an impulsive nut, what's more, he's always late, half past nine.
- Here he comes.
- At last.
- You're late.
- I'm sorry, I had a client.
- May I?
- Yes, go ahead.
A client, a police officer I couldn't get rid of him.
We all agreed that the business must be postponed.
- No, I agree with Maronin.
- There's no time to work out a proper plan.
Oh, all I need to know is the route and the time.
The wedding procession is across the bridge at 5:15, the second carriage is Vladinoff's.
What the devil you doing here?
Look at this place, close the bridge.
- Call the ambulance.
- Right sir.
Warn the horsemen.
- You, phone the minister.
- Yes sir.
Are you all right?
- Is my father hurt?
- His Excellency is safe.
- He's not wounded?
- Not a scratch Countess.
Thank God.
- Father, father...
- It's all right my dear, it's all right.
You get in the next carriage.
Come in.
Come in.
Alexis?
What's, what's the matter?
What is it? What's, what's happened?
- Nothing, it's all right.
- Come over here.
Whatever happened?
They got me, he fired as I ran.
Just out right, through the buff.
- You mind if I stay here a little while?
- No, no, of course not.
- There may be danger to you.
- Danger? Don't be a fool.
I'm sorry to be such a bother to you.
Go on, forward.
- You political prisoner?
- Yes, but I'm no better off than you.
- Tell me, how far is to Siberia?
- Take us at least six weeks.
Something ought be done about these dining cars.
Lunch wasn't good but their dinner was simply uneatable.
As a soldier I'm accustomed to privations... but the caviar was filthy and the champagne is certainly not 1906.
Now what the devil is happened?
- The train stopped sir.
- I know that, you fool. What for?
I'll go and see sir.
- Colonel Adraxine?
- Yes.
Urgent dispatch Colonel.
Bad news?
Splendid news, general mobilization.
You know what that means?
- War.
- War, at last.
Prisoners for Vatterus get ready to leave.
- Hoflosev.
- Yes.
- Bernstein.
- Yeap.
- Nevski.
- Yeah.
- Osipenko, Osipenko.
- He's there.
- He's a fever.
- Never mind, come and help him up.
Come on, get up there, come on.
- There's a doctor where you're going.
- All right.
- Rinkoff.
- Yeah.
- Payden.
- Yeah.
- Chiskim.
- Yeah.
Go.
- Give me four packages of that...
- You can only have two.
- How's that?
- The most we're allowed to sell prisoners.
- It'll have to do then.
- Give me two.
- Sugar?
- Over there.
- Excuse me Captain, are we to remain here?
- What's your name?
Ouronov, Axelstein.
Axelstein?
- No, you're to go to Roskovensky.
- Roskovensky, I never heard of that.
I have.
- Here?
- No, east of that.
- About here?
- Somewhere there.
It's over 1,000 berths north of here.
- The world's end.
- Yes, the world's end.
- We're leaving in a few minutes, get ready.
- This has just come.
Spreads like fire, doesn't it?
Yes, looks as though all the European countries will soon be involved.
Ready sir?
- The sled is here.
- Ready?
The sled is here, we can start out.
Would you mind telling us the latest news, we've heard nothing for several weeks.
- You knew Russia was at war, didn't you?
- No, we didn't, with what country?
Germany, France, England,
Austria, they're all it.
- Not England?
- Yes, England.
- Looks as if the whole world is coming in.
- England?
Well, war is one thing you won't to have to worry about Roskovensky.
- War.
- That's what we'd been waiting for.
Come on, come on. Last in, come on, get at.
- Ouronov, what's the time?
- What is that matter?
Night for six months... and a blasted cold hell for two years.
It's 11:33 in the morning, if you're really interested.
Nights, nights, nights.
Night, always nights.
Never ending night.
Nothing but night over all year.
The sun must be dead.
Everything must be dead.
We're the last things alive.
Sorry Axelstein.
I've to be melodramatic once in a while.
Calendar finished yet?
I can't be quite sure whether it's
March the 15th or the 16th.
- I suppose it makes little difference.
- Well, at least we do know that it is 1916.
Two years in this frozen hell... while the rest of the world turn upside down and inside out and no tobacco.
I've been working out a theory Ouronov.
The Imperial Army is sure to be defeated.
Perhaps, even now the war is over.
Russia's fate is in the hands of her own people.
There's bound to be a revolution.
Ah, and listen to this.
Comrades, the work fellas and people, the last hour of the struggle is here.
With a fist of arms, we must wipe out the bourgeois... and aristocrats from the face of the earth.
Death or victory, now or never.
Comrades, on behalf of the Soviets of Klintsy
I ask you to honor us Comrade Axelstein... by accepting the position of chairman of the Soviets of our town.
All you have skilled work will have to join the Red Army, fall in.
Next.
- Have you any papers?
- Come with me.
- Just a minute.
- It's Comrade Axelstein.
- I'll take it.
- Oh, thank you.
This is my dear comrade and friend...
Peter Ouronov, the man who was sentenced with me to exile.
You can't go home now... they've made me Commissar of
Klintsy and you're my assistant.
Olga...
Paola, Elizabeth...
Elizabeth...
Elizabeth...
Ivan, Ivan...
Martha, Martha Bedoyna...
- What do you waiting for?
- Come on.
What's the matter with you? She's only a woman.
I wasn't trying to get away, I was, I was born here.
Born here were you, well, now you can die here. See to it.
The next one.
Give me shirt, give me shirt.
- Is she in there?
- Yes.
- Can we have a look at her?
- No.
My orders are to wait until
Comrade Axelstein arrives.
- Take away.
- See that you carry them out.
And what is more, all this senseless destruction is got to stop.
Don't you understand? You're destroying...
- the property of the people.
- All right, all right.
The point is what we going to do with the woman, I say shoot her and be done with it.
- No.
- Why not?
Here is an order requiring us to send her to Petrograd for...
Waste of time, Wee got the rifles, we got the wall and we've got the woman.
- And we got the order.
- Here, whose side are you on?
- On the side of revolutionary discipline.
- Revolutionary fiddlesticks.
How much is she promised you to let her go?
Be careful Tomsky or I shall report you to the Central Committee.
Report me? You'll hear some reports before the night is out, I promise you.
There's going to be trouble here unless we get her away.
- Yes, and not much time to lose.
- Well, it's up to you.
You start at once, you can reach Saratuse before dawn and take the train to Petrograd.
Get up please, get up.
- Who are you?
- I'm the assistant Commissar.
I'm ready.
Wait.
- Am I not to be shot?
- No.
But I want to be shot,
I hate you all, I despise you.
You're red vermin, long live Russia, long live the tsar.
- What must I say to make you kill me?
- I have to take you to Petrograd.
- Why?
- By order of the government.
- Then in Petrograd?
- That I don't know.
But they'll kill me in Petrograd, why not here?
I have my orders.
And I must obey them, I'm sorry.
And it's better that you should obey them too.
- Why?
- Well, it's better.
- Let's go then.
- You can't go like that.
Unless you want them to tear you to pieces?
I'll try and find you something that will make you less conspicuous.
Parator Station as quick as you can and don't step for anything.
Come along, better hurry.
Halt, stop the horses.
Stop those horses.
- Your orders?
- Axelstein.
It's cold, don't you let me put this around you?
Already dawn.
Wait.
Station master? Station master?
Good morning, comrade.
- You are the station master I suppose?
- I am the station master.
When you expect the next train to Petrograd?
- Train number 617 to Petrograd at 2:20 PM.
- Will it be on time?
The 2:20 is always on time.
Go back to Klintsy and report to...
Comrade Axelstein that I'm at the first train from Saratuse.
I was to go with you comrade.
You go back to Klintsy and report as ordered.
I go back to Klintsy comrade, and report as ordered.
You know you've nothing to fear from me, don't you?
I know Commissar.
- Where the guards?
- I sent them back to Klintsy.
- Were those your orders?
- No.
- Thank you.
- Why did you send them back?
- Didn't like the look of them.
- Were you afraid of them?
Afraid for me?
Now that you're alone, aren't you afraid that I'd try to escape?
Where could you go?
Yes, you're right.
Where could I go?
Go back to Klintsy, Comrade Commissar.
He wants the woman to himself.
There's plenty of money, did you not see it?
I did, go back to Klintsy, eh?
- Yes.
- Afterward.
And report that he joined the train at Saratuse, eh?
You've got it.
Thank you.
- What's your name Commissar?
- My name is Peter Ouronov.
Peter Ouronov?
- Where are you from?
- Oh, you wouldn't know the place.
- Oh, sorry.
- It's far away?
Very far away.
- You know my name?
- Yes I know, is Alexandra.
- Were you living in Petrograd?
- Well, I was but I'm not to leave my orders.
Oh yes, your orders.
Take your seats, please, Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd...
Take your seats, please, Kazan, Moscow...
What did he say the train?
I didn't hear any, did you?
Hey, just a minute.
I, wait here, I'll go and see.
Take your seats please,
Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd.
Take your seats please,
Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd.
Take your seats, please,
Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd.
Take your seats please,
Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd.
Where is train?
Take your seats, please,
Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd.
But I don't see the train.
The train is that are seen are being blown up.
- Is the train coming?
- No, it's mistake.
I'm afraid we're in for rather a long way.
Think you better try and get some sleep.
It's not very comfortable but don't know when you'll get another opportunity.
You're very tired, you know.
- Please try and sleep.
- Thank you.
Why don't you try and get some sleep?
No I, I think I'd better stay awake.
- Where are you Commissar?
- I'm here.
Why is it all so quiet?
At stations one always hears whistles, signals, bells.
Well, the bells are out of order, try to sleep.
I can't sleep.
Been trying to pray.
- You don't pray, of course Commissar.
- Sometimes.
When I was having long sleepless nights
I used to try to repeat verses to myself.
- You had sleepless nights?
- Siberia.
- What verses?
- Oh, Shakespeare, Browning, Shelley.
But they are English poets.
- Have you been a student in Petrograd?
- No, at Oxford.
But it was very seldom that Russian students went to Oxford.
My father wanted me to go to Oxford.
I see.
Say some of your verses.
- Browning.
- Browning?
You must not fear death...
fear death to feel the fog in my throat, the mist in my face.
- Oh, I'm afraid I'd be boring you.
- Go on.
Well, just the end, I admire it.
For sudden the worst turns the best to the brave.
The black minutes at end.
And the elements rage, the fiend voices that rave...
shall dwindle, shall blend, shall change, shall become...
first a piece out of pain, then a light,
then thy breast. Oh, thou soul of my soul, I shall clasp thee again.
And with God be the rest.
- You like it?
- It's optimistic, like the English.
Listen to a Russian poem.
It is hopeless and pessimistic, like we Russians.
I have grown weary of my little dreams.
I have outlived the hour of my desire.
Alone with tortured empty heart I will be...
beside the ashes of their dead gray fire.
The lasting wind of destiny has blown the roses of my glory with its breath.
Go on, don't stop.
- And listen for the shambling feet of death.
- Louder, louder.
Since solitude has made winter in my heart, now like the last frayed lonely leaf am I.
Know how to use it? Go on. Get back.
It weighs upon the storm, right forest bound...
- Why did I do that?
- Was in self-defense.
You saved my life and probably your own as well.
Train number 617, train number 617.
Train number 617.
- I'm going to...
- Do you strong enough?
- I'm alright to wait outside for the train.
- I'm afraid there are no trains.
No train?
What are all these people hurrying for?
Take your seats please,
Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd.
Take your seats please,
Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd.
Take your seats please,
Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd.
Take, wake up, wake up, take your seat, take your seat please.
Take your seats, take your seats please.
Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd, take your seats please.
Take your seats. Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd.
- Just a moment, just a moment.
- No, leave me lone.
I'm not going to hurt you.
All I want to know is where you're going.
- The forest.
- The forest, why? To hide?
Come on, you can tell me.
Fresh soldiers, they was headed to us, the other army.
Which? The whites?
Come on, you can tell me.
I'm not going to hurt you, all I want to know is which, the reds or the whites?
- The whites.
- Are you sure?
Yes, Cossacks, Cossacks.
All right, go.
Did you hear that?
- Seems the Whites have retaken Saratuse.
- I heard it.
Well, it's about a mile from here, can you manage it?
- Yes.
- Come on then.
- Cossacks, it is the White Army.
- Yes, it's the White Army.
Go to the outpost, you better shout out as you get near in case they try to shoot you.
Ask at once for an officer.
Tell him who you are and tell him to take you to the Commandant.
Say that you've escaped from a Red
Commissar who was taking you to Petrograd.
Ask for his help and try to get at once to the south.
Goodbye.
- And you?
- Oh no, I'll be all right.
Safe journey to you.
- Would you allow me to thank you?
- No, no, no.
- Goodbye.
- Comrade Ouronov?
Yes?
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Outpost number four.
All right, pass.
- Next?
- Anton Pakrovsky.
Red town Commissar.
- Anything to say?
- I am a peaceful citizen.
I was made Commissar against my will.
Take him out.
But Captain, I am innocent,
I swear it, I am innocent Captain.
- You don't understand Captain.
- Next.
Vivan Lupien.
Corporal Tamaneff of outpost four reporting a prisoner.
What's she been doing?
Came to the outpost and wanted to see the commanding officer.
- Your name?
- I'm the Countess Adraxine.
I want to see the commanding officer.
- And what business had you at the outpost?
- I want to see the commanding officer.
- Answer my question.
- Are you the commanding officer?
Answer my question or you'll be sorry for it.
General...
- Alexandra Nicolei.
- Andreyevitch.
My dear Alexandra.
But what in heaven's name is all this?
I very stubbornly insisted on seeing the commanding officer.
And the captain, very rightly, wanted to know what I was doing here.
Come with me Sasha, we'll look after you.
Why, in a week we shall retake Klintsy.
Yes, you will be back in your own home.
- Could I possibly have a bath?
- Yes, certainly.
- Karevsky?
- Coming Excellency.
Here, Excellency.
The best room you have for the countess and a bath.
Well, I can manage the bath your Excellency but...
- There's no but.
- Well Excellency, there's no soap.
Lieutenant Gregorin?
- Yes sir?
- A cake of soap for the countess.
- Yes sir.
- Thank you, General.
- I'm sorry to give you so much trouble.
- Oh, it's no trouble at all.
- And I hope you'll preside at our dinner.
- I would love to.
But I can't appear like this.
Certainly do something about it.
- What about this one?
- It's getting better.
- And aren't they wanting you in the house?
- Yes, them want.
I think is somebody at the door.
- Dresses for the countess.
- Good gracious.
I hope you brought enough.
Well, she can't dine with us without a frock.
No, more is a pity.
You don't know what you're missing.
Your dresses have come.
I think there are about 50 of them.
Will you please go and lay them out on the bed?
Gentlemen...
Go on, please don't stop.
Will you have a glass of champagne Countess?
- You all right Sasha?
- Yes.
But I can't believe that I'm really here.
In safety with friends...
- and to hear music again.
- Yes, it's all over Sasha.
Cheer up.
- Now Countess, what are your plans?
- To leave Russia.
Leave Russia?
Why, in another month, we shall be in Petrograd.
- Of course.
- You are coming home with us.
Shall we dine?
- What was that?
- No cause for anxiety, Sasha.
- What was it?
- Just a matter of routine.
They weren't killing the Red prisoners?
They were executing some commissars and a few other Red bandits.
Where are you going?
Well, I lost the company,
I've been on patrol duty.
Fall in with us, we storm Saratuse in an hour.
Get up, the Reds are here.
Get up, you fool, the Reds are here..
Get in the cellar, down there.
- Lukovsky.
- Here at your service comrade.
This vodka is filthy stuff.
You can do better than this.
Well, I have some special bottles in the cellar but there's not enough for everybody.,
Everybody? But I'm not everybody.
- Bring them up.
- At once comrade.
Nikolai Rakof.
The former of the White murderers.
- Responsible for the death of 43 comrades.
- I tried to save all I could.
- I can bring witnesses.
- Take him away.
- Don't, don't, comrade...
- Next.
Fellow comrade, without me they can decide nothing.
- Who?
- The commissars.
What's more, they're all cowards.
- To your health.
- Good health to the delegates.
- Good health to the delegates.
- This is my round.
- Welcome comrade, come on.
- They get treating us all.
- Oh, no, no thanks.
- Come on, drink, come on.
- Come on, have a drink.
- Have a drink.
- Why worry?
- Forget it.
Drink.
- That's better.
- Shall I tell you a great secret?
Soldiers are soldiers.
White or Red, there's no difference.
They can order you about but what can they do?
Shoot, kill, destroy but, but I organize.
- Can you organize comrade?
- Yeah.
The reorganization of the economic life... on the basis of the ex-appropriation of the means of production.
Bravo.
Did you understand that?
- Yeah.
- You did?
Do you want to reorganize the boot factory?
I'll make you commissar for reorganizing the boot factory.
No?
Theater? No?
Electricity, that's very important.
We're going to electrify the whole country.
Prisons? No?
- Hotels?
- Oh, what did you say about prisons comrade?
We'll reorganize everything. There it is.
With my signature on that commission, you'd be in charge of the prisons.
Good health to the comrades. Bravo, bravo.
- Reorganize everything.
- Every real thing.
You organize everything, eh?
- What's become of this Countess Adraxine?
- She's in the prison.
Take two men and bring her here.
Hello comrade, what about a little vodka before we go home?
No, brother, we better not, drink it yourself.
Very sorry comrade, the woman prisoner is already been released.
- What? What on earth?
- The commissar went to the prison.
- What? Stop that brawl there. Commissar?
- Yes, with a special order.
Devil he did, what fools we've been.
We must get them both, man and woman.
Call a search party. Send a hundred men.
- A hundred men?
- A hundred men.
- Don't sit down there waiting, get on.
- Come on.
- Can we rest here?
- Yes.
- We safe here?
- I hope so.
- There must be brook somewhere.
- The Gulburch Brook.
- You know this forest?
- Belongs to me.
It belonged to me.
We mustn't rest here any longer.
I'm on the run now as well as you.
- Shall we go?
- Not just yet.
Why?
I'm afraid the searchers are coming in the forest.
What do you want me to do?
There someone in the woods, not far from here.
Think we'll be safe here.
- You keep your nerve now, won't you?
- Yes.
Swear you'll kill me before you let them get me.
Swear.
Alright, I swear.
Get in there, they're coming through.
It's our only chance.
Keep still, don't move, don't say a word.
- Found anything yet?
- Who are you?
- You're not our company.
- No.
- What company are you?
- What? Third.
What the digging you doing here? This is our beat.
Oh, it's the devil's own job comrade, I...
I'm no forester and I lost my way because I lost my whistle.
- You're not going to drink alone?
- No, only an ox drinks alone, have it.
How can I answer? I've lost my whistle.
You let me drink and I'll whistle, will you?
- Let's sit here and finish this.
- No, no, we can finish that as we go along.
- Come on, they'll be looking for us comrade.
- Oh, it's a dog's life comrade.
Where are you going?
- They're over there.
- No, they're not, they're there.
- We heard them.
- Is he with that outfit?
No, no, I'm with the others.
Oh, he's all right, we can go along together.
- Is the flask empty?
- Not quite.
Hello?
Hello?
- Don't be afraid, tell me where you are.
- Here I am.
Were you thinking that I wouldn't come back for you?
When did you fall in love with me?
First time I saw you, get up I said, get up.
You turned and I was lost.
Listen.
Good news.
- What is it?
- Heavy guns.
Mean they're fighting again.
They'll give up the search.
And in a few days, we'll be able to leave the forest.
Don't you like my forest?
I adore it.
Hello, comrade.
- Any luck?
- The skies opened and mana fell from heaven.
You ready? Catch.
Did you call this outfit mana?
Well, I thought we'd better look like refugees than soldiers.
Keep still just a minute, there.
- Come here.
- I wanted to see myself.
Careful.
Where did you pick them up?
Pick them up? If you'd heard me bargaining for them and for the other things.
- Did you bring some food too?
- Did I bring some food?
I don't believe it.
- Lobster.
- Yes.
- Jam.
- And...
Brandy.
There's enough there to last us for days and days.
I think that old boy must be the champion looter of the revolution.
- And all he wanted was your wristwatch?
- Well, what's the use of a wristwatch... in a country where trains are apt to be a week late?
Oh, yes, train.
- We have to find the train.
- And we can.
The old boy tell me, we're not very far from the line to Kazan.
We must go down into the plain.
- How far is it to the nearest station?
- The nearest station?
There 10,000 people waiting for the train at every station, just wait here.
You'll see, we'll stop them.
Get out of the way, get off the track.
Get out. Stop. The train is full.
Get out.
There's no room in here. Get out of me.
- Please, my sister can't walk anymore.
- Let go of me and get off.
Come on, where there's so many there's room for two more, come on.
Very nice, would you like them comrade?
Do you like me comrade?
Nobody can leave the station without a pass from the commissar.
Right.
- Show your hands.
- Pass.
Inside.
Pass.
- Pass.
- Show your hands.
Inside.
- Inside.
- They allowed you to go.
- Go, please.
- Pass.
- The name?
- Fredo Moramo.
- From?
- Moscow.
- Where you going?
- Astrakand.
- What for?
- To be with my family.
- What was your job in Moscow?
- I was a clerk in an insurance office.
Every word a lie, you're Conola, managing director of the Pudalafki works in Petrograd.
You financed the White bandits.
You conspired against the
Republic of Workers and Peasants.
You're a fugitive from the justice of the people.
And you're on your way to the White Army.
Condemned to be shot.
Next.
Show me your hands.
- Why did you send him in?
- I didn't Comrade Pushkov.
- He came with the woman.
- Who is the woman?
My sister.
Step up, show me your hands.
These are the hands of a woman who... never worked in her life.
- Your occupation?
- I was a lady's maid.
Worst sort of counter revolutionaries.
Like relics, lady's maids.
- Your name?
- Anton Andrea.
- From?
- Tchekerovsky.
- To?
- Subhorsk.
- What for?
- I have a brother there.
My sister needs nursing.
- Why?
- She was ill.
- What illness?
- Typhoid comrade.
- Why aren't you in the army?
- I was ill.
You too? Sensitive family.
3/4 of the population of
Tchekerovsky were sick with typhoid.
- What's your occupation?
- Electrician.
The army needs electricians.
I'll leave my sister with my brother and report for service in the army.
Pass.
Countess.
Good afternoon, well rehearsed.
Countess Alexandra Adraxine, nee Vladinoff.
Daughter of the bloodhound Vladinoff, fugitive from the People's Justice.
- What is your name?
- Maria Andreas.
Don't be ridiculous Pushkov, look.
Yes, there's a slight resemblance.
- Slight?
- Slight.
- Well, what else I need to prove her guilty?
- Proofs, witnesses.
- What? Expect a grand duke to turn up?
- No, but there's Lieschen.
What about Lieschen?
Lieschen was a gardener on the Adraxine estate.
- I'll fetch him.
- Stand back.
Next.
- Your name?
- Ivan Smirnoff.
Just my size.
Load.
Present, fire.
Did you find anything on him?
Yes comrade, sewn in the lining of his coat.
A White spy, condemned to be shot.
Come here, stand here.
Turn your face to him.
Lieschen, look at that woman.
- Who is she?
- I don't know comrade.
- Have you never seen her before?
- Never comrade.
Lieschen, you were a gardener on the Adraxine estate.
- I was.
- You ever see the countess?
Very often comrade.
Are you ready to swear that this woman is not the countess?
In front of the altar comrade.
That's all, take her to the guard room.
And now what?
Honored guests of the revolution?
No, I have to report to the checker in Samara, I'll take them with me.
Waste of time.
We've no right to shoot this woman unless we can prove her guilty.
- Rubbish.
- If found guilty, they'll both be shot.
- The train leaves in an hour.
- Next.
Next, next.
Pass.
Blankets? Blankets.
I'm afraid it was an ordeal for your sister,
I'm sorry, but we can't be too careful.
Yes, yes, of course.
I think it best that we make ready for the night straight away.
- Oh, let me help.
- Thank you.
- You must be tired out and ready for sleep.
- Yes, I'm tired.
Oh, let me go up there.
- It's Quite all right, you go below.
- No, but, surely...
- I really insist.
- Oh, it's very good of you.
- When do we get to Samara?
- Tomorrow evening.
- Tomorrow evening?
- Yes.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you very much.
I'm afraid you won't find it very comfortable here.
Feels quite luxurious to us, we've been traveling for three days in a cattle truck.
- Shall I shade the light?
- Yes, thank you.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night.
- Where could that other boot have got to?
- Oh, here it is.
Thank you.
Hello?
- No more commissar?
- No, I didn't hear him go.
- Don't worry, he won't be far away.
- What you think of the fella?
- Was very polite.
- Well, that's something, anyway.
What's more, he strikes me as an honest man.
You're right.
That's not going to make things any easier for us.
Come in.
- Oh, tea.
- Yes, I got it from the engine driver.
Thank you.
- No thank you, I've had some.
- Are you sure?
Yes, really.
Well commissar, are we going to face another trial in Samara?
Yes, I'm afraid so.
And when that happens, perhaps it might be wiser... to tell a more convincing story about yourselves.
Don't you think we were speaking the truth then?
Would ever be truth without trust.
You, for instance, don't trust me, obviously not.
- At any rate, we owe you our lives.
- Even that was a matter of hard lying.
You should thank
Lieschen, he's a marvelous liar.
Shouldn't we also thank you commissar, for telling him what lie to tell?
Oh no, no, you mustn't think it like that.
My own lie was a very poor one compared with Lieschen's.
What was your lie?
When I said that photograph bore only a slight resemblance to you.
Actually, I thought it a pretty good one.
- You don't think I'm going to admit it.
- No, of course not.
Don't let's admit anything.
I don't really care who you are.
- Yet you made every effort to save my life.
- That was because I like you.
Did you?
Well... since you don't care who
I am, there's no reason why we all... shouldn't be the greatest of friends.
Oh I hope that perhaps you share some food that I've got.
I'm afraid the bread is very stale but there's a little cheese to go with it.
Don't you think, if the commissar is so kind we might share our food?
- We brought some with us too.
- Oh?
Oh but, oh but this is amazing.
To think that I offered you my stale bread.
We are very grateful for it.
- I haven't had a picnic like this for years.
- There's even enough for supper tonight.
And this to wash it down.
- You don't know Samara?
- No.
Our army is just take it from the very important people... all kinds of people, who are all kinds of things before the revolution.
There are bound to be many who knew the Countess Adraxine in person.
And no Lieschens, eh?
The perfect Lieschen is the rarest of all creatures.
I see.
So you're warning us.
Hardly as much as that, but I'm wondering what's going to happen to you.
- I mean, none of us know that.
- No way.
No, but I thought you might possibly have something in mind.
I'm afraid we just do what we can as a rule.
- Don't we?
- Me and you.
- Just take a chance if it comes along.
- What else can we do?
- You had luck so far?
- A wonderful luck.
And the most wonderful of all was to meet you.
Do you think so?
Yes, I do think so, even if tomorrow means the end of us.
As it may do.
Tomorrow may mean the end of me too, if it does... will you remember me?
Forgive me for saying that your sister.
I understand Pushkov, we both understand.
Before we reach Samara tomorrow, I'd like...
Oh I, I most humbly beg your pardon.
I don't know what you must think of me behaving like this.
I think this brandy, I'm not used to it, I...
No it's, it's quite understandable.
We've all been through a great strain.
Isn't it good to stretch your legs again?
How peaceful.
This is just a small place on the Volga.
If you go down there, you come to the river in about 10 minutes.
See some barges tied up for the bank for the night.
Believe they sometimes take a passenger if there money to pay.
Some of the barge men are
Tartars grand old fellas.
This is really the most interesting part of Russia.
Only so few people see it.
Excuse me, I must go and get our order stamped by the commissar.
You know, I, I pity him in a way, he's such a boy..
Do you realize we've got to escape now?
It's almost dark and there's mist.
- We should've a chance, surely.
- Yes, I believe you're right, we should.
- How with the boy?
- What about him?
He might, he might suffer for it.
Yes, that's true.
What's happened?
- The commissar shot himself.
- Deliberately, through the head.
Oh dearest, quickly. There's no time.
What is it? What is it?
I just realized that, that if this is what he wanted us to do.
Of course. Come.
Forgive me dearest, we're going too fast for you.
A train, the train...
What is it darling? What is it?
Do you hear the whistle?
Do you hear the whistle?
Don't leave me.
We're approaching Astrakand.
As soon as we arrive I'll fetch a doctor.
Papers? None?
Go on.
Everyone on deck, medical inspection.
Nobody else on the barge? Nobody ill?
- Come on, speak up.
- A woman, a man is gone for a doctor.
Well, I'm a doctor.
Now dear children, don't be frightened, we won't eat you.
Here, take this, it's chocolate.
- Stretcher.
- Coming sir.
- Attention.
- Attention, attention.

Get up, what are you doing? Get on.
In a few minutes, it won't hurt you anymore.
Shoot you fool, get after him.
Hey, young fella, what you doing here?
Doctor.
- Well?
- I just saw him go somewhere in there sir.
Hear, you can't go in there, this is Red Cross Hospital.
- There's an operation going on.
- Well, I'll wait till it's over.
I know this is unbelievable doctor...
I've no proof, I've no papers, nothing but you must believe me.
- I'm no cause to be here but for her.
- Of course I believe you, will you be quiet?
How can I tie up your wound if you don't stay still?
- It's all right, I'll keep still.
- Nurse...
- Yes, doctor?
- Let me go that list.
Yes sir.

<b>THE OKLAHOMA KID</b>
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>
The gentlemen of the press, Mr.
President.
Good. Let them come in.
President Cleveland will receive you now, gentlemen.
Gentlemen,
I'm at your service.
Mr. Cleveland, we'd like to know what you're going to do about the Indian appropriations bill.
During my previous term in office,
I was opposed of the opening of any Oklahoma territory to white settlement because I felt the terms were unfair to the Indians.
The cherokee strip contains 6 million acres of the finest farming land in America.
It is our last free frontier.
It's 180 miles long and 50 miles wide, but both houses have now approved the measure, and since I happen to believe that the will of the people is properly expressed through the congress,
I will sign the bill, and I'm issuing this proclamation.
That's it, boys. They pay off the injuns, and we move in!
Get that cherokee silver, Joe. We're in.
Right.
Who'll sign for this money?
I will.
Hear that stuff clink when they set it down?
Yeah. I kind of like that sound.
Good luck.
All right, throw down those guns. Get 'em up.
Now fork over those moneybags.
Unhook this lead horse.
All right. Come on.
Come on. Get up.
Hey! Hey!
Whip, it's a holdup!
All right, get cover, boys!
Come here.
I've had time to survey the whole cherokee strip, and as most of you know, the section we've chosen is perfect for a town site.
It's flat, and there's plenty of water.
The Texas cattle trails run down through here, and the sante fe railroad can build their line down here from Wichita.
And they will build it, too.
We'll give them a decent town and decent trade.
All around are thousands of acres of the richest land in Oklahoma, and it'll all be peopled by this time tomorrow...
Folks that will need doctors, lawyers, merchants.
It's a new start for all of us, but it's going to mean a lot of hard work, and it's going to mean sticking together for the common good, and it's going to mean getting there first tomorrow.
Now, there may be some trouble because I've been watched and trailed by men who probably aim to beat us to our town site, but they won't, for when that shot is fired, my son and I, with our fastest riders, will race across prairies and stake a claim.
The rest of you can follow with wagons and camp equipment.
Now, is that clear?
Yeah.
All right, then.
Good luck to everybody.
Let's take a look at that map.
John, you know
I envy you.
It's a great plan. I wish
I could be with you.
You will be later, judge.
Pop's counting on you bringing law into this territory, judge.
That's going to be some job, judging from the scum of the west I've seen drifting in here.
Won't be too big a job for you, dad.
You think one poor old judge can make the whole robber's roost behave?
If anybody can.
Seems I've raised an optimist, ned.
Come on, John.
There'll be a lot of changes in our lives after tomorrow.
First, you'll be riding circuit with your father, and I'll be helping to start a new town.
Aren't you thrilled?
I would be if it didn't mean us being separated.
Tulsa will spring up overnight, ned, and we'll soon be settled there with father holding court and sending dangerous outlaws to jail.
I soon as I get there,
I'm going to claim the most beautiful spot of all for us.
Ned, isn't it wonderful?
A whole new life ahead of us, a whole new city, and soon a new state, and it all begins tomorrow.
Get your partners for a dance!
Ned, let's dance.
One more couple right over there.
That's it.
Well, here we go!
Salute your partner.
Forward dance, swing on the right.
Swing on the left.
Hold the man proud and tall, and swing him round.
And forward and back, swing on the right, now on the left.
First lady and last gent, forward dance.
Do-si-do.
The next lady and the last gent, forward dance.
Do-si-do.
Now, then...
All join hands and circle to the center.
Grab right, then left.
When you reach your partner, everybody swing to the right.
Now to the left.
Have...Have you seen who's here?
Take her to your arms and swing her all around.
Who's the stranger with Jane?
I wouldn't know.
How'd we get in here?
Well, I don't know.
Beautiful night, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
Just feel that air.
Feel that air. Go on.
What?
Feel that air. It's like velvet, isn't it?
What's the matter with you?
Can we go, darling?
So soon? Let's stay a little longer.
Hello, ned.
Surprised?
Hardly. I expected you to show up sooner or later.
You know each other?
Yes, but ned's a very funny kind of fellow.
Doesn't like to admit it.
Your father's waiting for us.
Wait a minute. I haven't thanked the lady for the dance.
Thank you, milady.
May I look forward to again being favored next time we meet?
You're a lunatic.
'S crazy.
Did ask you to feel the air?
Why, yes. Who is?
Someone I'd like to forget.
But I told you, we ain't got no rooms left.
I didn't ask you that.
I asked you which was the best room in the house.
Number 6, and there's about 18 boomers sleeping in it right now.
But that's our room.
I told you we couldn't hold nothing, miss.
I told you, you had to sit in it to keep it.
The town's overrun with boomers, and if you ain't there, they are.
What's this about our room?
I told you we couldn't hold nothing.
I'd be glad to let you have my room, ma'am.
Well, that's very kind of you.
Thank you, but we couldn't put you out.
Wouldn't be putting me out.
Just a minute. What room do you think you have?
Number 6, and you're very welcome to it.
See here. I told you who was in number 6...
About 18 boomers sleeping on the floor, 3 deep.
That's all right. They'd be glad to do a favor for a lady.
That's awfully generous of you, but I really don't know how to thank you.
Not another word.
Just leave it to me.
Hey, what's going on here?
Come on, you mavericks!
On your feet!
The land rush is on!
Come on!
They've fired the starting gun! Come on!
'S taking me home to his house.
The soldiers are all bunched on the immigrant line, but on the other side of the creek, they begin thinning out to one soldier every 50 yards.
Two.
We can slip through there tonight and be on the inside, waiting for them.
What about this
"sooner" law?
Once we've staked out a claim, they can't prove a thing.
Well, what are we waiting for?
We're waiting for the line to thin out so we can slip through.
Bet $10.
That's brand-new money.
Where'd you get it, mister?
Minted it myself this morning.
Well, aces always beat kings.
Whip, I just seen one of the fellas that took that
Indian money off us.
Yeah? You sure?
'S playing with a lot of new-minted money.
Play that for me, will you?
Sure.
Where is?
That little fellow over there with the piano.
Say, do you know, I don't want to play in your yard?
They don't want that tonight.
Play it.
Not tonight, brother.
Play it.
Sure, that's one of my favorites.
Yeah, it would be. You know who that is?
No.
That's the Oklahoma kid.
Handley.
Tell that little squirt over by the piano
I want to see him.
Put it away, handley.
Kid, I want to talk to you.
Keep on playing.
I said I want to talk to you.
Well, go ahead and talk.
My name's whip mccord.
That mean anything to you?
How's that?
Mccord.
Mccord, mccord, mccord....
I don't like it.
Do you?
I want that
Indian money.
Well, go and get it from the Indians.
Kid, I'm giving you a break
'cause I'm pressed for time.
Don't you raise that bottle at me!
Give me that bottle!
Go on.
Get over there.
Get over.
That's a boy.
Play, professor.
Hi, sheriff. I'm glad you got here.
What's it about, mccord?
You looking for the man that held up the stagecoach and got that
Indian money?
Naturally. What's that got to do with it?
That's him just left here.
I called him on it, and started shooting.
How'd you know him?
How else would a man get new-minted money?
'S been spreading it all around the joint.
That's right.
We all seen him.
Who was?
The Oklahoma kid.
The Oklahoma kid, yeah.
Let me take a look at that silver.
I'll show you.
Let's compare watches, captain.
Here's ned.
Hey there!
Well, how are you, judge?
Get there first, ned.
We will, and don't be too long coming to our city.
Get it built first.
It's almost time to sound the warning signal.
Sound the attention.
Good-bye, ned, and good luck to you.
You're my good luck.
Bye!
Come on, ned.
Starting gun goes off in 5 minutes, boys.
Wait a minute, pop.
Wait a minute.
What's your best whiskey?
Kentucky bourbon,
11 years old.
I'll try some of your bar whiskey.
Want to catch that stampede?
Go ahead.
I'll hold down the bar.
Thanks. Have a drink on the house.
Squad, ready.
Squad, fire!
Hello, young fella.
Never got to thank you for the rooms.
Don't mention it.
Where's the bartender?
Outside watching the rush, I suppose.
It was a great sight, wasn't it?
I don't know.
I didn't see it.
You didn't see it?
No. I thought I'd have me a quiet little drink instead.
What'll you have? I'll serve you. It's on the house.
Here, try some of this uncut moonshine.
Got some taste to it.
Go ahead.
Thanks.
How come a strong, healthy young fellow like you isn't out there up to his neck in this land rush?
Why? I'm doing all right.
Those people are going out there to build a new empire.
Fine.
Let them have it.
You mean to say you've got no feeling for the country, no pride in seeing a civilization carved out of a wilderness?
What sort of an American are you?
I like the country fine.
As for civilization, I've got nothing in particular against it.
I can take it or leave it alone.
What sort of folks did you come from?
The most god-fearing, law-abiding, land-grabbing, empire-building fellas you ever saw.
Suckers for this land-rush stuff, too, but not for me.
I crave a nice easygoing existence, and I've got it.
I see. No responsibility.
No ambition.
None of this get-up- and-get-it stuff that regular folks have.
Exactly, and that's why my folks and
I have been on the outs for years.
You seem like a very antisocial young man.
But I'm not. I'm as social as a setter pup.
I like all kinds of people, but I don't take to this itch for plowing up new empires, that's all.
But why not?
I'll tell you why not.
Now, look.
In the first place...
The white people steal the land from the Indians, right?
They get paid for it, don't they?
Paid for it?
Yeah.
A measly
$1.40 an acre, price agreed to at the point of a gun.
Then the immigrants sweat and strain and break their hearts carving out a civilization.
Fine. Great.
Then when they get it all pretty and prosperous, along come the grafters and land-grabbers and politicians and with one hand skim off the cream and with the other, scoop up the gravy.
Not for me. Listen.
I learned this about human nature when I was about so high, and that is that the strong take away from the weak, and the smart take it away from the strong.
I suppose you never heard of the law that protects people's rights and property.
Yeah, I've heard of it.
I've seen it work, too.
Sometimes, it's all right.
In the cities, maybe fine, but here, you can't trust it.
This is the only law that I know that's worth a hoot in this part of the country.
The only law.
This is wasting time.
Come on. Let's have a drink.
Hands up.
Hello, Abe.
Hello, Sam.
Howdy, judge.
Will you kindly remove those irons, please, sir?
Why, certainly.
Excuse me, son.
This young fellow a friend of yours?
Well, not exactly. We're just having a drink together.
'S got some very original ideas about life.
I wouldn't wonder.
Just keep them up, son.
Don't start any trouble.
Well, what's up?
I'm Abe Collins.
Who?
Abe Collins.
Is?
Yes.
'S the sheriff.
Now, look here. You dropped some new-minted money last night in a Blackjack game, didn't you?
That's right.
What of it?
Nothing, only it happens to be part of that Indian consignment stolen from the stage yesterday evening.
Well, it seems like law won out, even out here.
We've been waiting a long time to pick up this boy.
Is that so?
Well, 's an amiable thief.
So pleasant about it all.
Who is?
We don't know his right name, but throughout the territory,
's known as the Oklahoma kid.
All right, kid.
Good morning, ma'am.
Good morning.
Lovely morning.
Father, what's happened?
Seems that our young friend is the Oklahoma kid.
Whip, here they come.
Sorry, gents.
I'm afraid you're trespassing on private property.
Sooners?
No. We just got here ahead of you. That's all.
We led the field all the way, nobody else in sight.
We'll have you sited at the land office.
Now keep your shirt on.
There's no sense in starting any trouble when everything can be settled quiet and peaceful.
The only way to settle this is for you to get off our land.
Your land?
Here's our claim stake sticking right up here in front of you.
You won't get away with this.
I think we will.
We've already got a man halfway back to the claim office.
You're licked, Mr.
Kincaid, and you know it.
Hey, what are you after?
Nothing much. We just heard you were figuring on building a town here.
That's all right with us.
All we want's a part of it and the exclusive rights to any saloons or gambling houses the town might need.
Who are you?
Where are you from?
Whip mccord from the panhandle.
What's your proposition?
You go right ahead and build your town and attract settlers.
So you can take away their money at faro and roulette?
Yeah, that's the idea.
You take care of their virtues.
I'll take care of their vices.
That's simple, ain't it?
We'll fight you through the courts first.
You aren't going to do yourself any good in court.
You can't start building until the title's cleared, and you know how long that'll take.
Meanwhile, some other town will be years ahead of you.
Anyway, why fight?
What's a few hundred foot of business frontage to an empire builder like you, Mr. Kincaid?
All right.
Pick out your ground.
Right here, and here's a waiver of right to protest under the sooner law, so that everything will be fair and square.
Hey!
All right, boys.
'S only a floater.
Get on with your play.
Shootings, killings, robberies, and a mighty orgy of drunkenness, gambling, and vice all directly traceable to mccord's influence.
Why, owns our mayor, our sheriff, and half our deputies.
Yes, they make arrests, just enough to save their faces, but we can't convict because, despite my efforts, juries are bribed and witnesses intimidated.
I say we need a showdown.
Either mccord and his crowd run this town or we do.
It's time to find out.
I know.
I've been wondering how much longer this could go on, but we made a mistake in the first place in making a deal with him.
Now, what do you suggest?
I say we should form a vigilance committee.
No, no. That would only be one mob fighting another.
We represent law and order.
We've got to take control away from mccord legally.
We've seen these gamblers and criminals make our city the nesting place for all the scum of the west.
We've seen vice and corruption flourish and our officials do nothing about it.
We've seen murders committed in our streets and public places and the murderers go unpunished.
We can't tolerate this condition any longer.
It's up to you, men, as voters, to stop this lawlessness.
I ask you to elect me mayor so I can clean out mccord and his gang of thieves and murderers.
I ask you to elect my son sheriff.
All right, boys, break it up.
Mccord!
Breaking up a few speeches isn't going to save you.
In the end, I'll see that the law gets you, and it won't be just to run you out of town.
It will be at the end of a rope.
We ought to do something about Kincaid, whip.
'S likely to get up the vigilantes like they did in dodge city.
We'll do something.
We'll get him on the end of that rope, and it'll be in his own law-and-order fashion, too.
What's the matter, Jose?
You don't like music?
You don't like the music?
All right, come on.
Come on over here with me.
I'm going to sit down here.
I'm going to sing to you.
Come on.
Ho ho ho.
All right.
You don't mind if I sing, do you?
Hey, now.
Once again, now.
How's that? You like it?
All right. Come on.
Everything's all right.
Come on. We're going to get a nice sleep?
We're going to get a nice rest, aren't we?
That's a good boy.
Callate!
Shut up.
It's Pedro.
It's all right.
You get everything,
Pedro?
- Si, senor.
- Everything.
Here's the dinero, senor.
Gracias, senor.
Pedro...
Pedro, saddle my horse.
Si, senor.
You go?
Si, manuelita.
You no stay for dinner?
No, gracias.
You come back soon?
Yes, very soon.
Manuelita, take care of these things for me, will you?
Adios.
- Adios.
- Adios.
Morning, friend. Where's the jailhouse in this town?
Right up the street.
You can't miss it.
Glad to hear that.
How's that?
Is that where they're keeping old man Kincaid?
Yep, smack-dab in the front cell upstairs where folks can stare at him.
All right. Thanks.
You're a stranger in town.
That's right.
Seems like I've seen your face someplace.
Well, I wouldn't know that.
I've been a lot of places.
Hyah! Come on!
Holy smoke!
Holy smoke!
Now, son, I wouldn't worry too much.
Who was that?
Why, it was the kid.
Who, the kid? It couldn't be.
Wouldn't dare.
Why, i...
I guess you're right, ned.
I must have been mistaken.
Now, about the trial.
With judge hardwick on the bench, there's nothing to alarm us.
Dad, you're covering up.
It was him, wasn't it?
Sheriff, the Oklahoma kid's in town!
I knew it!
I saw him myself!
Where are you going, ned?
I think I know where 'll be.
Wait. Don't do anything you'll regret.
What are you doing here?
Hello, ma'am.
Came here to see you and talk to you.
You shouldn't be in Tulsa.
The whole town is plastered with posters offering a reward for you.
I saw them... every one an insult. A measly $500.
Well, you'd better come inside before someone tries to collect it.
Won't you come in?
You're still as crazy as ever.
Thank you, ma'am.
I...
Very pretty.
This is aunt Maggie.
How do you do, aunt Maggie?
The hem got loose, and...
I see.
Well, excuse us, aunt Maggie?
We'd like to be alone.
There you are.
Now you can stop blushing.
Did you say you wanted to talk to me?
Yes, I did.
As a matter of fact, I want to talk to your father.
Isn't here. I don't know where I can reach him.
You could help me if you wanted to.
They tell me that the candidate for mayor is in jail.
Is that why you came?
Yes, strangely enough, it is.
I don't like to see anybody in jail.
You can understand that, can't you?
I never know whether to take you seriously or not.
I'm absolutely on the level.
I'd really like to help him.
It's not going to hurt anything if you tell me what you know.
Please.
Well, they say killed a man, a Mr. bates.
Let's not mind what they say.
What does say?
Says that bates sent for him.
When arrived at bates' house, found him dead.
A few moments later, mccord and some others of his crowd came in.
They've sworn that Kincaid had the gun in his hand when they entered.
Why?
Because they want him out of the way.
Thank heaven my father will be the judge.
Then you don't think they'll be able to get away with anything?
They most certainly won't.
Well, that's all
I wanted to know.
'Cause if you're satisfied...
I mean, you and your father are satisfied the old man didn't do the killing.
Of course didn't.
'S not that kind.
My kind?
Yes, your kind.
Thank you, ma'am.
Why are you making this your business, anyway?
Because happens to be my father.
Your father?
Hey, hey, hey.
Go out this way, through the back door.
Here's a chance to get yourself 500.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Jane, I want to talk to you.
What's the matter, ned?
Where is?
Who?
Sorry, aunt Maggie.
I'm looking for the Oklahoma kid.
I don't know who you're talking about.
Yes, you do.
You remember him.
Danced with you that night in cherokee city.
Yes, I remember him, but...
Well, 's here.
In Tulsa?
In this house.
Why, it's ridiculous.
Isn't.
Jane, look at me.
I told you isn't here.
Don't you believe me?
I'm sorry.
Ned, why didn't you ever tell me that was your brother?
How did you know that?
I'd rather not say.
Then was here!
Yes, was.
Why did you deny it?
Because was your brother, and
I wanted him to get away.
Are you sure that's the only reason you wanted him to get away?
Yes.
Where did go?
I don't know.
Ned, why didn't you tell me about him?
It's just that dad and
I don't think of him as a member of the family anymore.
Is that bad?
Wasn't as a kid.
We were great pals then.
But as grew up, everything changed.
Got so thought the law was meant for one thing...
Just to be broken...
So finally dad had to throw him out.
Why are you so interested?
I'm not. It's just that
's your brother and...
Jane, you know how
I feel about you.
Of course I do.
I would have spoken sooner, but I wanted to get myself established first.
Please, ned, not now.
Jane, will you marry me?
Ned, let's not talk about it now.
Come back later, tonight.
You are upset about Jim, aren't you?
Jim?
That's the kid's name.
Perhaps it is, ned.
I don't know, but please go.
All right.
Think you ought to take him up on that.
I thought
I told you to go.
And miss all that wonderful lying you did for me? No.
I wasn't lying for you.
Now you really are lying, like a gentleman.
Then it's lucky there's one gentleman present.
You mean I didn't thank you?
Well, I do thank you.
I really think you ought to grab ned off. Make a great catch.
Sober, serious-minded, industrious...
Law and order himself.
Good-bye, ma'am.
Where are you going?
I'll be around.
I'm going to give your father's justice a chance to work, but it had better work.
We haven't got a case.
I've known this fella hardwick for years.
You can't get to him.
Hasn't bothered us much so far.
That was different. We were getting people off, not convicting them.
It's easy to fake a prosecution, especially when the witnesses are fixed.
Why not? We own the jury, don't we?
It won't get to the jury.
If we'd used some cleverness in framing this thing, we might have had a chance, but with the case we've got, hardwick will throw us out of court.
Well, then, we'll get rid of him.
Use sense, whip.
I am.
Regardless of hardwick,
Kincaid's going to swing.
We'll start a run on that bank of his, and when it goes down, we'll take it over.
We'll get the rest of those upright citizens one way or another.
When we end up, this will be my town, wide-open, with more money pouring in than you ever saw before.
In the meantime, we've still got to worry about hardwick.
Yeah.
How long have you known him?
10 or 12 years.
'S from Kansas City.
There's nothing on him.
I've tried that before.
Has got any relatives?
Yeah, a brother. Feed merchant in Kansas City.
All right. We'll get hardwick out of the way.
You have the trial moved up a couple of days.
I think
I can do that.
That'll give us
Morgan for the judge.
Doolin, get me a boy we can trust...
Somebody that isn't known around here.
All right, come on.
Get moving.
All right, write a letter to hardwick.
We'll make it look as though it came from his brother.
I'll have a friend of mine mail it from Kansas City.
This is bad news, judge, very bad.
I'm extremely sorry.
Well, of course,
I'll leave immediately.
I'll catch this morning's stage for Kansas City.
Yes, I suppose you must, but what about Kincaid?
I'll have plenty of time to get to Kansas City and back before the trial.
Watch over things while
I'm gone, will you?
Of course.
All right, boys.
Everybody up!
It's on the house...
A celebration!
Here's to Mr. Ringo, the smartest lawyer west of Chicago!
And the trial set up for tomorrow with judge Morgan presiding.
Hooray for Mr. Ringo!
This can't be true.
I just received a postcard this morning from uncle Stephen.
'S not dying, and 's not in Kansas City.
'S in Montreal.
You think him trick?
Of course it is, to get father out of town.
When did the stage leave?
Maybe 4, 5 hours ago.
Get my horse saddled, quick!
Good morning, ma'am.
Kind of a hot morning to be riding so fast.
Please don't stop me. I've got to catch father. The trial...
Just a minute. Get those words out one at a time so I can understand them.
Yes, you should know.
Somebody's tricked father with this letter.
It must be mccord.
Not a word of it's true. It's just to get him out of town.
Why?
Mccord owns judge Morgan, that's why.
They've moved the trial up to tomorrow. Morgan will preside.
And they'll railroad the old man.
Unless I can bring father back in time.
Look here, you go on, get back to town.
Back to town?
Get hold of the old man's lawyer. Show him that.
Tell him 's got to delay that trial if you got to pull a trick out of the bottom of the bag.
But father...
I'll go after him, bring him back.
I'm kind of handy at stopping stages.
All right. I'm so glad you saw me.
I see you more often than you know.
I said I'd be around, didn't I?
Hello! Hey, wake up in there!
Hello in there!
Hey, wake up!
Who is it?
What do you want?
- Stage go by here?
- Yeah.
- How long ago?
- About two hours.
Put up the gun. I want a change of horse.
I'm willing to pay for it.
Which...
Hyah!
All right, boys.
Throw them down.
The rest of you can take it easy.
All I want is judge hardwick.
Come on.
Well. You?
Yep. Put them down, judge.
This is no holdup.
Well, what is it, then?
This may surprise you, but right now
I'm working for law and justice.
Your brother isn't sick at all.
Mccord sent you that note to get you out of town.
How did you know about that note?
- Your daughter told me.
- My daughter?
Yeah. She didn't like the looks of it, and I did a little investigating.
Mccord has had the trial moved up, and judge Morgan is presiding.
- Morgan?
- Yeah.
That sounds like him.
What's your interest in this?
My name is Jim Kincaid.
Are you
John Kincaid's son?
Yeah. But this is wasting a lot of good time. Come on.
Have you got another mount?
No, but we can pick one up at a settler's cabin down the road.
All right, boys, on your way.
Hyah!
Hyah!
Handley, take the stand.
Raise your right hand.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
You say that Mr. bates was alive when you left the house?
Yes, sir.
Showed us out.
Ned tolley can tell you that.
Saw bates come to the door and say good night to us.
I object, your honor, to the witness testifying that...
Overruled. Proceed.
Mr. tolley saw bates see you out.
Yes, sir.
What did you do then?
We walked on down toward the square.
I happened to turn around just in time to see Mr.
Kincaid go into the house.
Then?
Well, that kind of worried us.
We knew Kincaid had it in for bates...
I object, your honor, to the witness...
Overruled. Proceed.
So we went back.
Just as I got to the door, I heard a shot.
We busted in and found Mr. Kincaid standing in the center of the room with a gun in his hand and Mr. bates lying on the floor dead.
What did you do then?
Naturally, we looked to see if was dead.
Was.
We took the gun away from Kincaid and sent for the sheriff.
Not ned... the old sheriff, hartley.
Kincaid came up the steps to mccord and said to all of us...
Well, anybody could tell you what said.
I object, your honor, to the witness testifying that...
Overruled.
Proceed.
Well, said, "I'm going to get you, mccord,
"and I'm going to get bates, too.
One way or another,
I'm going to get you."
So, gentlemen, if you think the defendant did shoot and kill Mr. bates, you can find him guilty of murder in the first degree.
On the other hand, if you think did not kill him and there's any reasonable doubts in your mind, you'll find him not guilty.
The jury will retire.
Your honor, I don't think there's any need for the jury to retire.
We can take a vote right here.
I'm so glad you're back.
Where's dad?
Stopped at the bank to see Mr.
Martin. Well, what's happened?
Has the trial started?
It's all over.
They found him guilty.
It was the worst kind of a farce.
They'd hardly let
Mr. Martin speak.
Well, I guess
I'll be moving along.
Don't do anything foolish.
It seems to me that's just what I've been doing, riding around trying to catch the law by the coattails.
Perhaps dad can get a new trial.
Perhaps can prove that this one was illegal.
Perhaps, but you can't expect him to lean on any of these people.
Jim, think of your father and how feels.
'S an honorable man.
'S lived with the law.
Yes. I think
's very lucky to have a no-good son to see doesn't die by it.
I don't think 'd get much satisfaction out of having your father, the judge, read blackstone at his burial.
Hyah!
Get them up.
Over here.
All right, out.
Come on.
Is that cell empty?
Yeah.
Now, where's my old man's cell?
Who?
- Kincaid.
- Your father?
Where's his cell?
Upstairs, in front.
Get in.
John Kincaid?
Hello! Here!
Hello, pop.
Jim!
Come on, pop. I'm taking you out of this tin can.
No, you're not.
Come on, get into that coat.
I don't need your help.
Wrong again.
If you're going to depend upon the law, you're going to wind up on the end of a rope.
Hey!
Go to the bank and get the sheriff.
The kid is breaking
Kincaid out of jail.
And here's one for you...
The kid is Kincaid's son!
What's that?
Yeah. Now, get going!
I know you mean well, but there's an issue in this town you wouldn't understand...
Law or anarchy.
I represent law and order.
You don't. You never have.
I'm not here to argue right from wrong.
Do I have to hit you over the head or carry you over my back?
That's the only way you'll get me to go with you.
If I let you take the law in your hands, it would be an admission of my guilt.
You see, Jim, it isn't only my freedom that I'm fighting for.
But they've got you framed!
Sheriff, the kid's got the keys.
Went upstairs to the old man's cell.
Come on!
Come on!
So long, pop.
Good luck, son.
Locked the deputies in the cell and went upstairs to get Kincaid.
What do you think? Kincaid is the kid's old man!
Say, that makes it easy.
That's a jailbreak.
This time, we'll be the vigilantes.
Men, come over here!
Come in close!
You all know the Oklahoma kid?
Yeah!
Well, I just heard that the Oklahoma kid is old man Kincaid's son.
And what's more, the kid's in town right now, trying to break his old man out of jail!
Old man Kincaid was convicted of a murder.
A jury made up of you men said that should hang.
Yes, of course should!
Are you going to stand by and let an outlaw take a murderer out of jail?
No!
If the law won't stop him, we will!
Right. And if the law won't hang
Kincaid, then it's up to us!
And if we get the Oklahoma kid, we'll hang him, too!
Are you with me?
What are we waiting for?
Let's go!
Go with them and keep them hot.
Come on, boys, for old man Kincaid!
Looks like a hanging party.
Mccord gang's in the lead.
Think this will fit him, boys?
Let's go up and try it out on old man Kincaid.
They're on their way to the jail.
Come on, boys!
Come on, where are those keys?
Come on, boys!
Here is!
Where's the kid?
I don't know.
Was here, wasn't?
Yes.
Helping you to escape.
Wanted me to go with him.
That's all
I wanted to know.
Listen to me, in the name of the law!
Shut up!
Hello, Jane.
Do you know where my old man is?
'S in there.
Jim, they've killed him.
The mob broke into the jail, and...
Who was it?
Mccord?
No, his gang, but mccord wasn't there.
Do you know who was there?
There was doolin, curley,
Indian Joe, and handley.
Doolin, curley,
Indian Joe, and handley.
What are you going to do about it?
I'm going to the territorial governor in the morning and insist put this town under marshal law.
A little bit late for that.
Then we'll go after the ringleaders and bring them to trial.
You better do it fast if you want to get there ahead of me.
Father stop him.
Stop him!
'Ll be killed.
You couldn't stop him now, Jane.
I don't know as I want to.
Come on, get over there.
Over.
Now, where's mccord?
Ain't here.
And curley, doolin, and handley?
They ain't here either.
Indian Joe?
Where's mccord?
I don't know, kid.
Who did the hanging?
I don't know, kid.
It was mccord, wasn't it?
Was in on it.
I don't know, I tell you.
I don't know.
All right.
Come on down here.
Now, you can tell mccord and the rest of his gang,
I'll be calling on them, too.
Great bunch of quitting rats, the whole crowd of you.
A couple of hundred men, and the kid walks in and picks off Indian Joe like it was a shooting gallery.
We didn't have a chance, boss.
Now, look, get out!
The kid said was going to get us all, whip.
Named every one of us.
Are you turning yellow, too?
No, but don't you think we ought to duck, at least till the law gets the kid?
No.
I'm staying here.
This is my town, and nobody's going to run me out of it.
The kid wants to shoot it out with me, I'll be here.
How do we stand legally?
Just like I told you, you weren't there.
You're all right unless somebody can prove you started it.
They can't prove that unless somebody says something.
No.
There ain't nobody gonna say nothing.
But the boys here are not in such a good spot.
There was a big crowd there, and some of the citizens must have recognized them.
I'm going to hit the trail.
Might be best if they all did.
I don't want any part of that kid.
I'm with doolin.
I think we better go.
- All right.
- Go ahead, run out.
If anybody talks, you won't have to worry about the kid.
How far is it to burden?
That's over the Kansas line about 30 miles.
You figuring on getting there tonight?
How many horses you got?
None. Just a mule, and 's lame.
Go on. You two better get out of here. Go on. Go.
Where's doolin and handley?
How should
I know?
You were in on the hanging, weren't you?
No. Give me a chance, kid.
I'll give you the same chance
I gave Indian Joe.
Go on, reach for it.
Well, if you don't reach for it, I can't shoot you.
What'll it be?
Whiskey.
Right.
Come out and get me, kid!
Aha!
I didn't do it, kid.
I didn't...It was mccord.
Mccord...Water...
It was mc...
It was mccord...
First Indian Joe...
Then curley.
The list dispatched from
Kansas City simply says they found handley's body in the freight yards with the neck broken.
Yeah, but, judge, you know as well as I do, the kid got him just the same as got curley and Indian Joe.
Yes, I know.
And one of these days we'll hear that doolin has gone to his reward...
Whatever that may amount to...
And then we'll chalk up another for the kid.
Yes, it's a puzzle to know how to feel. A man's torn.
One side of him says it's a frightful thing for a lad to be piling up such a record of bloodshed, and the other side of him says, "go get him, kid.
Get doolin next."
If only we could get evidence against mccord and bring him to trial.
Martin, you know, that ned has worked as hard as any man possibly could these past few weeks.
It's impossible to get evidence.
The mccord gang is a closed corporation of closed mouths.
If we don't hurry up, the kid won't leave anybody for us to get evidence against.
Jim.
Hello, Jane.
Is your father in?
'S inside with Mr. Martin.
I've got something that'll interest him.
Jim, you shouldn't come here.
Do you realize there's a price on your head?
Yeah, yeah. Look, I've got doolin outside.
- Doolin?
- Dead or alive?
A little bit of each.
But I think may be revived enough to bring his voice back.
What did you get out of him?
The whole story, and I don't think I'd like to hear it again, so I'll leave him in your hands.
Take doolin down to the jail with ned. I'll be right down.
Well, in that case,
I'll be going, too.
Jim, what are you going to do?
I've got a date with mccord.
Son, I know just how you feel.
In that case, you won't hold me up with a lot of talk, will you?
Haven't you done enough?
I haven't done anything, except kill a lot of coyotes in self-defense, if you want to put it in law talk.
Please wait.
It's no use, Jane.
Would it mean anything to you if I asked you not to go?
Don't talk like that.
You and ned are...
I love you, Jim.
You don't know what you're saying.
I'm no kind of a man a woman could tie her bonnet to. Ned is.
Women are crazy.
That's why they fall in love with the wrong men.
But they do.
Now will you stay?
No, no. I've started a job, Jane.
I've got to finish it.
It's a small point of honor that maybe a woman wouldn't understand.
All right, Jim.
I'll try to understand.
There's only one thing
I want, really, and that is for you to come back safely.
Give me some of that water, will you?
Take it easy, doolin. Tell me one more thing, then you can have a drink.
I'll tell you everything, only give me a drink of water...
Mccord responsible for that lynching or not?
Water, please.
Mccord responsible for that lynching?!
Yes, of course was. Was behind the whole thing.
Excited the boys to do it.
That's all you need, ned.
Here's our witness.
Give him a drink.
I'm going down and arrest mccord.
Water.
Whip, I saw the kid.
Brought doolin into town.
'Ll be coming here next.
All right, fine.
I'll be glad to see him.
Now, you two boys go outside, and when the kid shows up, make sure you draw first.
Make sure your aim is good.
Leave it to us, whip.
We'll watch him.
Mccord, you're under arrest.
Get your hands up and walk toward me.
Look out, kid.
Good work, ned.
Good work.
Yeah. We make a good team when we're working on the same side.
Now, don't talk anymore.
You're not hurt much.
I'll go and scare up a sawbones. Come on.
No, wait.
I must tell you now.
I wrote the governor, said you'd been working on the side of the law, asked him for a pardon for...
Never mind that.
You'll be all right.
Just get up here, and I'll get you.
I'll get you.
Remember when we were kids, you fell out of the apple tree?
I had to carry you home that time.
Yeah, sure, ned.
I remember.
One good turn deserves another.
Come on, now.
Easy. I'll get you home.
I'm sorry, ned.
We should have gotten together sooner.
Where are you going, Jim?
Chasing the moon.
I hear there's a lot of new territory out Arizona way.
Oklahoma's practically new.
Couldn't you just stay here?
No, I don't like the country around here.
Why, it's beautiful country.
I know the scenery's all right, except those placards.
Every time I look at one of those $500 insults,
I get madder and madder.
Get around!
But they're coming down.
Father says it.
Down or not, I'd always remember where they'd been.
I understand.
A new country, a new leaf.
Me, turn over a new leaf?
I'd have to turn over a whole public library.
Well, after you've done all that, you think you'll ever, ever be back this way again?
Well, maybe, maybe not.
It all depends on the way things turn out.
Well, good-bye, Jim.
Good-bye.
Jim, is Arizona an awfully big place?
Yeah, yeah.
So they tell me.
Then I'll have a hard time finding you, won't I?
Look here, Jane, you don't want to let yourself...
I just mean if you're empire-building, it would save time...
Who said anything about empire-building?
I just mean it's a difficult thing to do by yourself.
For an empire, you've got to have people.
For people, you've got to have children, and for children...
By authority as judge in the crying need of this situation...
Just a minute, judge, you...
Jane, do you take this man to be your...
Yes, I do, dad.
Yes.
Just a minute...
Jim, do you take this girl to be your...
You don't want to get yourself into this.
Takes me, father.
Whether likes it or not.
Very well, then.
I pronounce you...
Hold that hat.
Man and wife.
THE WAVE
Nothing.
What are you going to do?
Let's see what we can find in town.
How did it go?
- Bad. No work anywhere.
- Or fish.
I went to La Ensenadilla yesterday and this is all I could find.
Miguel, my son is really sick.
Do you need anyone else to work?
Hold on.
Any work for Zurdo and Miro?
Not even for one of us?
- No.
- Too bad.
Go see Don Anselmo Herrera.
He might be able to help you.
No, Miguel.
I'd do anything not to have to ask him a favor.
There's still no fish.
The season is late this year.
Should I buy another ice machine?
Excellent!
Thank you.
Good-bye, uncle, and take care.
- Good morning, Don Anselmo.
- Good morning.
I would like to ask you something.
- What?
- My son is very sick.
If he doesn't get to the hospital soon, he'll die.
Lend me enough for the trip.
I worked in your fish market last year.
I will work to pay you back.
Business is bad, expenses are high.
There's no way for me to help you.
Forgive me.
It's not right for a child to die... because his father couldn't pay to cure him.
- Where did you get those?
- In La Ensenadilla.
Look, the best of the year!
- Let's go see Santiago.
Put the nets down there.
Out of the way, let us work.
Put your hands down.
Out of the way, let us through.
That's fine.
Unload the fish.
I'll see Don Anselmo and hear what he has to say now.
Thank you!
Come on, guys. Let's go.
Miguel, now we'll make our money!
You'll see!
I can't do anything today.
If they elect me,
you know how things will go.
But you need money for these things.
Yes, I agree, but the fishing is not going well.
Good day, Don Anselmo.
Good day, sir.
- What's the latest?
- There are plenty of fish.
Good.
Use the big boat and the new fishing net.
Don't tell me you need to buy something else.
I just need people, boss.
Fine. Hire some and hurry.
You know that when the catch is good, your commission is good.
That's why I'm the chief.
Excuse me.
What do you say now, Don Anselmo?
We'll see.
Where did you get the money for luxuries?
I worked in the mangrove swamp cutting the stalks for Don Andrés' wife.
Well, you got luckier than me.
I'll wait for you, so you can buy me root beer.
I don't need anyone else.
I've got all the workers I need.
Do you want to fish with me?
Come to the lighthouse.
We're leaving soon.
See you there.
- Could I come too, Mingo?
- Yes, but I'm not waiting for anyone.
How are you, Miro?
- How do you think?
- You've been unlucky.
Would you like to fish with us?
Yes, I need work.
Come on, then.
The boat is by the lighthouse.
- Forty-three kilos.
- Forty-three kilos.
Fifty-eight kilos.
Lower.
We worked hard today, boys.
If we carry on this way,
I'll buy a house for Helena.
Who's more stupid? Man or fish?
Who knows?
A man who lets himself be caught hook, line and sinker by a woman.
Well, yours definitely caught you good.
Thirty kilos, no more.
Thirty kilos, no more.
Come on, they're going to pay us.
Come and get your cut.
- How much did they bring in, Mingo?
Good.
At six centavos per kilo, each person gets 72 centavos.
What are you waiting for?
What are you doing?
Same as always.
Seventy-two centavos for 10 hours' work.
All so that the rich get richer.
You shouldn't be complaining.
Be grateful you've got a job.
Look at him, he's young and strong.
He's happy.
He doesn't complain.
Happy?
Have you ever lost a son because you couldn't afford medicine?
No, I have never been that unlucky.
You call it bad luck.
I call it misery.
Yes, I agree, the world isn't perfect, and working conditions aren't ideal, but if you vote for me,
I promise I will improve the situation.
Do you think we're idiots?
We know you would say anything to get us to vote for you.
Not me, and I promise to make you lose as many votes as I can.
We are tired of false politicians.
While we're talking of promises,
I'll make you one and I'll keep it.
I don't care about your promises and they don't scare me.
Relax.
Relax.
Let's go, Miro.
You know the big fish always win.
Why argue? This is how it works.
It never gets us anywhere.
Yes, but we're not fish.
What a great fishing net.
No holes for it to escape.
Who? The fish, or us?
Us and the fish.
What do you want us to do?
Take poison.
Don't be stupid.
When you're my age, you'll know less than you do now.
Maybe.
After working 25 years on the sea for few centavos, a man's brain gets wet and his heart dries out.
If you'd ever gone to church, you wouldn't talk like that.
Don't be ridiculous.
I don't have to give my money to others to get a place in Heaven.
And besides,
I don't plan on going there.
We know you don't believe in anything, just what's in your glass.
At least that way I can forget them and their damn nets and boats.
They who have everything and who give you nothing.
That's God's will.
Yeah, and mine is to take my knife and...
No, that's just mindless destruction.
Listen to me.
Listen to me, everyone!
We must do something, but not this.
This will get us nowhere.
We must call a meeting, today, to decide what we should do.
I need to tell you something.
We should make a plan to defend ourselves, but all the fishermen need to go.
You go and tell them on the pier.
You tell them at La Trocha, and you at La Ribera.
A DRAMA OF POVERTY AND MISERY
How's it going?
Have you heard the latest?
What?
I found a man named Albino running to a meeting.
What meeting?
To make a statement about how little you pay them.
I see. It is serious, then.
I told you so, and it's more serious for your business and mine.
I trust I can count on you to...
Good word of mouth can do wonders, as you know.
And even more with a bit of...
Fine.
Here's 200 pesos.
Come back for the other half when this has been sorted out.
I know these people.
Yes, but don't forget time flies.
Friends.
How long do we have to put up with this slavery and poverty?
Who of you in any given year earns more than 40 centavos a day?
Who can feed their families with so little?
Who has money for medicine?
We all know it's unfair, but we know it doesn't have to be this way.
A few exploiters take everything, to satisfy their greed.
They did not make the sea, the rivers or the fish and they didn't make the canoes, boats or nets either.
Nor did they make us.
They didn't give our arms the strength with which to work or anything else.
Why can't we exchange our fish with those who breed cattle, with those who harvest corn, or with those who make fabric?
Who prevents this change?
Those with money have taken over the boats, nets, transport.
They control everything, and they pay us whatever they like.
We know what happens for eight months of the year, when there is no fishing, and when we can fish, they take half for the boats and the nets.
The exploiters pay us six centavos a kilo, and they pay the chief his share plus two centavos per kilo.
They resell it for three centavos with ice and for 12 in crates.
If it costs 26 centavos, they sell it in Mexico City for 80.
Poor folk elsewhere can't eat fish and we can't eat vegetables.
Poverty is not the law of nature, nor is it God's law.
Bravo! Bravo!
The exploiters are strong because they unite to exploit us.
They agree to pay us the same, and they shackle us all with the same chains.
Let's unite, as only then will we be strong enough to protect ourselves.
Bravo! Bravo!
We ask only for what is rightfully ours, the fruit of our labor.
But we can't do it alone.
We only want to be paid what is right.
If there is no work, there's no fish.
Let's suffer together.
Let's stick together!
Friends, the battle begins tomorrow, with the first catch!
Bravo! Bravo!
Fishermen! Fellow citizens!
I'm speaking to the sons of this glorious state, which upholds exemplary traditions of value and glory, to the honorable fishermen, always conscious of their duty and of their obligations as citizens of a democratic republic.
To those who appreciate the value of institutions and the power of a vote.
To those who do not heed the words of the rebellious, who are unaware of the majesty of revolutionary conquest.
I invite you, my friends, to consider the problems of this nation and those of our dear town.
We must never forget this, as this is the only way we will be able to reach a truthful conclusion, a divine truth, the only one we must seek, the only light on life's dark path, to aid us in judging our hesitations.
- What's wrong, Miro?
- So Mingo didn't say anything?
He said you were unwell.
Sure... after he kicked me out this morning.
So now what, Mingo?
I received an order from Don Anselmo.
I have nothing to do with this.
Let's go weigh this fish.
So, are we in this together, or not?
Of course, we're still in this together.
In that case, come on.
Mingo?
What do you want?
The boys want good money.
And who asked you?
They did.
It makes no difference.
I don't put a price on the fish.
Then go and talk to Don Anselmo.
Tell him if he doesn't pay better, we'll throw it in the river.
Here come the others.
We refuse to deliver the fish until we get paid a better wage.
You should all do the same.
It would make no difference.
We won't get anywhere.
If we hold on together, we can win this.
And what do we eat in the meantime?
Let's go, boys.
Don't give in!
Come here.
Let's go quickly.
Here come the soldiers.
It's nothing.
Let's bring him to the boat.
Why don't you search everyone here?
Shut your mouth!
They're not armed.
Nothing has happened to the fish.
These men are loyal.
The guilty ones have already run off.
In that case, I will find them.
This matter seems unimportant.
We'll investigate.
If you'll excuse me, sir.
- Please, go ahead.
- Many thanks, Lieutenant.
Don Anselmo said that you protected the fish, so you deserve the others' share.
Put it in here.
Come with me.
Mingo.
Where are you off to with the boat?
None of your business.
What do you want now?
Don't worry, we're here for another reason.
I'm guessing it's not just to see us?
It's not just that.
Is there suddenly another reason?
Yes, there is.
We see things differently now.
When you left they paid us.
- I smell a rat.
- I don't think so.
Let him talk.
They paid us less than yesterday... and they tried to buy us with your half of the money.
We won't be bought and we are not thieves.
Here is your money.
Money? That's all you care about.
Have you forgotten him?
- Dead?
- Yes, dead.
Because of your lack of unity.
No.
That's not it.
What happened today woke us up.
We must punish those who killed him.
We must follow what he showed us.
Let's follow his path all together!
We will achieve what Miro wanted to achieve.
This is the beginning.
When we have the boats, ice and nets, we will work for ourselves and we will have won.
That's right. Let's go into town.
Let's show everyone what oppression really is.
Let them join us.
THE END
And now, children.
We come to one of the most famous.
And most priceless pictures in the whole world.
The Medici Venus.
I want you to notice the beauty and delicacy of the composition.
And the flesh tints.
Isn't she a little bit skinny, teacher?
Not skinny, Tommy. She is ..
Well, slender.
She is the embodiment of female grace and form.
All visitors out please.
Come along, children. We must be going.
All visitors out please.
Closing time.
All visitors out please.
Closing time.
Hey, Bert! Hey!
Yes? What's up?
Come here, quick.
It's gone.
Look. Look!
"Sorry, but I had a better use for this."
"The Amateur Cracksman."
Read about it.
Old master still missing. Paper, paper.
"Cracksman laughs at police."
"Tell me what is wrong with Scotland Yard."
"There is an enquiry demanded .."
MacKenzie, I want to warn you. You'd better not take this thing too calmly.
What with the newspapers and the questions in parliament.
Scotland Yard is being made a complete laughing stock.
This sort of thing has got to be stopped.
Once and for all.
I'm busy.
- Sir, it's about ..
I don't care what it's about.
- But it's about the picture, sir.
The Venus, sir.
That's it.
The one that everybody is talking about.
Do you mean that you can tell us something about it?
Do you think you've got a clue?
- No.
I've got the picture.
Here, sit down. Sit down.
Well, upon my soul.
What is your name please?
Maud Holden.
How did you get this?
It just came in the post.
In the ordinary way.
I opened the parcel.
And there it was.
And this was with it.
- Oh.
"I saw your farewell performance when
I was a boy. I have never forgotten it."
"Would you return this to .."
"Dear old Scotland Yard for me."
"I understand there is a reward offered."
"Amateur Cracksman."
Well.
So you are Maud Holden the actress?
- Well.
I used to be.
When was your farewell performance, Miss Holden?
Oh .. twenty years ago.
Aye.
You don't think I've had anything to do with this, do you?
The theft, I mean.
- No, no.
Of course not, Miss Holden.
Thank you very much.
I think I can promise you the reward.
Thank you, sir.
It seems as if the amateur cracksman is somewhat of a benefactor, Miss Holden.
Well.
In this case .. yes.
But I don't want anything said of it.
Don't worry, Miss Holden. We're no more anxious for the publicity than you are.
Thank you. Good day.
Good day.
This is the picture alright.
- And do you think that will help us?
You see, we'll be more of a laughing stock than ever if this news gets out.
Can't find the criminal.
Can't even find the picture and the confounded thing is handed to us.
If it wasn't for him, I'd ..
[ Radio: ]
"Mr Raffles is bowling today."
"Apparently, he had the Australian batsmen completely baffled."
"Mr Raffles is getting ready to bowl now."
"There goes the ball. There go the wickets. He's done it!"
"And it's seven wickets for Mr Raffles."
Mr Bunny Manders is on the telephone, sir. He wants to come and pick you up.
Not now. Tell him I'll meet him at The Ambassador.
Very good, sir.
Mr Raffles thanks you, sir.
He says he'll have to meet you at The Ambassador Club.
And if you will excuse me, sir.
- Yes? What is it?
It is these bills, sir.
Some of them are becoming ..
If you will pardon the expression, sir, a trifle exigent.
You said the grim total is 200 pounds?
- Yes, sir.
I'm arranging for that this evening.
- Very good, sir.
[ Alarm bell! ]
Blimey, look!
There is your burglar.
Must have got locked in.
Looks like he's having a good time too.
Here, get him off that alarm button.
Come on, Pussy.
Well, will you put handcuffs on him, Philips?
I don't think so. I don't think he'll try to get away.
No tricks now.
I think I'd better take him back home.
Rascal. Making all this row.
And don't try and steal my watch.
You are a concern.
I think I'd better take him home, eh.
Well, my missus won't have him in the house. I promise you that.
I'm going to try to sneak him into my house.
Good evening, Inspector.
- Hello, Philips.
Everything quiet?
Is that under arrest?
Yes, sir. Taking him in for giving a false alarm at Baldridge's.
What's that?
A kitten in Baldridge's?
- We found him playing with the alarm.
It doesn't sound right to me.
- Not right?
There's no way of getting in Baldridge's without setting off the alarm.
If somebody knew that they might bring along a kitten.
Get some men round the back of the shop.
- Yes, sir.
Come with me.
- Yes, sir.
Hello, A.J. Good show today.
- Thank you very much.
Good work, Raffles.
- Thank you, sir.
Good evening, Mr Raffles.
- Get me a packet of Hiltons, please.
Thank you.
Ah, A.J.
We thought you wouldn't show up.
I've been telling Gwen you'd come.
That means I got here just in time.
Your brother is an atrocious dancer.
Bunny. A waltz is a thing of grace and poise. You take the lady's hand, so.
Place your right hand, so.
See you later.
But Lady Melrose is waiting for you.
This brother and sister dancing should be discouraged I think.
Especially if the sister is you.
- Can this be you talking?
Yes, I think so.
- Gwen.
Lady Melrose.
- Pretend you didn't hear.
Gwen, dear.
If we don't go to her, she'll come and get us.
Lady Melrose.
How do you do, Mr Raffles.
I am so glad to meet you.
I can't see why she wants to meet you.
She doesn't give a hoot on cricket.
No. But I know a personable young man when I see one.
Sit down there. Gwen, come here.
May we have your picture, Mr Raffles?
Do you mind, Lady Melrose?
Not at all.
Just look at each other if you will.
How could I look anywhere else.
Thank you.
Getting that old face of yours in the papers again, my dear?
Yes. I thought I would have to go through the divorce court to do that.
At my time of life.
Well, I'm very glad to see you, Raffles.
I've been to Lords every day this week.
A splendid show. Congratulations.
Thank you very much.
I'm very proud to meet you. I saw you play for the gentlemen in 1919.
Did you, by gad?
Don't encourage him, Mr Raffles.
Or you will be hearing all his cricket history.
You rescue me. Come and dance.
- Yes, I'd like to.
I think you'd better dance with Gwen.
I was beginning to feel like the other woman.
Mind you hurry back.
- We will.
Now that is what I call a really charming man.
He was my house captain at school you know.
There was nobody like him.
And he hasn't changed a bit.
Well, come and sit here by me until he comes back.
I'm afraid I have to get back to barracks, Lady Melrose.
"Barracks"? Nonsense.
A date with a chorus girl, most likely.
Don't be so old-fashioned, George.
But you brought Mr Raffles, so I forgive you.
You and Gwen are coming down tomorrow for the weekend. Don't forget.
There is just the possibility I may not be able to manage it.
I'll phone in the morning, if I may.
- Alright.
By the way, we've got a new telephone exchange down there.
I'll write down the number for you.
I've got to run along.
You'll see Gwen home, won't you A.J.?
- You leaving?
Yes, I've got to. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Do you mind seeing me home?
- Mind? I'm in luck.
Oh, you are saying the nicest things tonight.
I am? Oh, it just comes natural.
I haven't been drinking.
Oh .. Gwen.
There is that voice again.
Mr Raffles.
We've been glad to see you.
Goodnight, Gwen darling.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Where to, sir?
15 Lennox Mews, please.
Very good, sir.
Come on, Lucy. Come on.
Come on.
Do you know that I've never ridden in one of these things before.
I'm glad you haven't.
- Why?
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe because I should like you to remember this evening as well as shall.
You know, you're a strange person.
Strange? Well, why am strange?
You say things like that just to encourage a girl and then ..
The next item we meet you are ..
Terribly nice and polite and ..
Distant.
Why, it's not very easy to be distant in a hansom cab even if you want to be.
And I don't.
You know Gwen, when you used to visit Bunny at school.
I was terribly in love with you. I was always far too scared to let you know.
Nine years ago.
You've changed a good deal since then.
Too much, perhaps.
And not all for the better.
What do you mean?
- Oh, nothing.
Now there you are. That's what I mean when I say you're mysterious.
Tell me your big secret.
Because I felt for a long time that you had one somewhere in your life.
I'm awfully tempted to tell you just one secret anyway.
It's simply this.
I'm still in love with you.
Oh, I am so happy.
I could laugh or sing or something. Or just chatter.
Oh darling, so could I.
Can't you make it down to Melrose this weekend?
We could have so much time together.
- With you?
Well .. of course I can.
Whoa, Lucy. Whoa.
Here we are, sir.
Already?
Once more around the paddock?
- Yes.
If it ain't too late for you, it certainly ain't for me.
Come on, Lucy.
Barraclough.
Barraclough.
I am coming, sir.
Did you call me, sir?
- Yes. Did I wake you up?
It's perfectly alright, sir.
- That means I did. I'm sorry.
Have a drink, Barraclough.
- Have a drink, sir?
I'll pour it out for you.
I'd rather not if you don't mind, sir.
- I do mind. How much soda?
Well, if you insist, sir.
I will take mine without soda.
A splendid idea.
It is an old family custom.
- Oh, indeed?
To the Barracloughs.
- To the Barracloughs.
I beg your pardon, sir. Thank you.
Tell me, Barraclough. Why have you never been married?
Surely there must have been some woman in your life?
There was, sir.
Two of them to be exact.
That was years ago.
Neither of them became Mrs Barraclough?
- No, sir.
Perhaps that was because I knew them both at the same time.
It didn't seem to work out.
Perhaps you're wondering why
I'm in such a gay mood tonight?
No, sir. I think I've already guessed the reason, sir.
You have?
From the tenor of the conversation.
With your permission, sir.
I should say that you have met a lady.
The lady.
Barraclough, you're positively psychic.
Thank you, sir.
Are you contemplating matrimony, sir?
If she'll have me.
I'm turning over a new leaf.
After tonight the old
Raffles is no more.
Behold the new.
Love does some strange things, sir.
Barraclough, you need another drink.
No, sir. I'd rather not if you don't mind.
I've become very talkative and I insist on singing.
Ha. Well, what's the matter with that?
I sing very badly, sir.
Is that all, sir?
That's all, Barraclough. For you.
For me, life is just beginning.
I see, sir.
Barraclough, did I remember to say she's the most wonderful girl in the world?
I had hoped, sir.
That you were going to spare me that.
Goodnight, sir.
[ Door knocks ]
Come in.
Look.
Well, what do you make of it?
How did it come?
- In that cigarette packet.
Hiltons.
Fingerprints?
- I've just sent for Evans.
These please.
- Very good, sir.
"My farewell performance."
First the picture and then this.
What do you make of it?
Is the fellow reforming?
I don't know about that, sir.
But I know that he can't wipe out a crime by this sort of thing.
"Farewell performance". Pah!
He thinks he has the right to end things just because he thinks he will.
But that's where he is wrong.
We'll give him his farewell performance.
Have you got something?
He has.
- What is it?
"West Milton 28."
Looks like a telephone number.
- It is.
Foster.
Foster, is that you?
Find out whose telephone number is ..
West Milton 28. I will hold on.
That will be all, Evans.
- Yes, sir.
Yes.
Yes.
Lord Melrose?
Are you sure about that?
Thanks.
The telephone number belongs to the country house of Lord Melrose in Essex.
West Milton.
Come on, Mr Raffles.
Show us what you can do.
Jolly decent of His Lordship to give Mr Raffles for our side.
Aye, it will give us a chance for once.
Give it everything you've got, Mr Raffles.
Fine bowling, Raffles.
Come on, Mr Raffles.
Here I am.
Harry. You frightened me.
- Don't be so jumpy.
The old girl bring the necklace down with her?                - Yes.
You saw to that, eh? You got a little plan of the layout like I told you?
Yes. Here it is.
The big tree is just opposite this window.
This is Lady Melrose's room.
First door on your right.
I can do it with my eyes shut.
Harry, don't you think we ought to give it up?
If you're caught it's prison.
For me too.
- Will you take hold of yourself.
You want to go to Australia don't you?
You want to have your own little farm?
You know I do.
- Well, stop worrying.
Don't forget, a sleeping powder in the old girl's milk tonight.
I won't forget it.
Now, we'd better not be seen talking to one another.
Howzat!
Thank goodness that's over.
Now we shan't have to go through it again for another year.
Oh Lady Melrose, I don't believe you dislike cricket as much as you pretend.
My dear, it bores me to death.
It bores poor Gin and Tonic too.
Come along, darlings. Come with mummy.
Shall I take them, Milady?
- Thank you, Wilson.
Goodbye everybody. See you later.
And Wilson, I will wear the gold dress tonight.
Such a nice girl, Wilson.
She's the only maid I've ever had who doesn't breathe on me.
Have you finished in there?
A.J. I've got to talk to you.
What is it?
Well .. I'm in trouble.
Bad trouble, A.J.
I've been nearly off my head all day.
I phoned your flat this morning.
But they told me you'd come down here and that's what brought me.
Is it money?
Bad?
How bad?
Worse than you can imagine.
Oh, I've been a fool.
I've been gambling.
It's at thousand pounds.
All in one go?
No, it's been going on for weeks.
I don't know what started me.
But that isn't the point.
Last night after I left you, I ..
I had a final plunge to get it back.
And of course I lost.
But this time it wasn't my money.
They were mess funds I took.
This morning I found out there is an audit coming on Monday.
Oh, I see.
I'm just a common thief.
I'll be cashiered, disgraced.
They will put me in jail. I've been thinking about doing myself in.
You know that wouldn't help.
- It would get me out of it.
What about Gwen?
Would you do that to her?
What am I going to do?
I don't know yet.
You need a thousand pounds by
Monday. Is that it?         - Yes.
I don't mind telling you I haven't got it.
You haven't?
No. But that doesn't mean it can't be got.
You mean that?
Practically anything can be if it has to be and quite obviously this has to be.
The only question is how.
There is not a lot of time.
That was lovely.
I hope that interruption didn't disturb you just now.
That husband of mine.
Bunny.
Cheer up. Everything is going to be alright.
You mean I can count on it?
- Every penny of it.
Thanks, A.J.
What?
- Did you enjoy it, sir?
Oh yes. Splendid, splendid.
Nothing like a whiskey and soda after music.
How about a spot in the library?
- That's a good idea, sir.
Come along, come along.
- Thank you.
If you can't do it Raffles nobody else can.
Bless my soul.
Scotland Yard?
Scotland Yard, did you say?
Yes. Inspector MacKenzie.
Alright. Show him in. Show him in.
- Yes sir.
What on earth do you suppose
Scotland Yard wants here?
I can't imagine.
Lord Melrose?
Inspector MacKenzie?
Well, what is it? What do you want?
If you don't mind, sir.
My business is confidential.
Nonsense, nonsense. These are my guests.
This is Mr Whitely, Mr Thorndyke.
And Mr Raffles.
Mr A.J. Raffles, the cricketer?
Oh, I am a great admirer of yours, sir.
Well, I've long been a great admirer of yours.
Oh, I've read a lot about you.
You're quite a famous person.
Thank you, Mr Raffles.
Now if you will kindly tell me what your business is.
Lord Melrose.
We have reason to believe that an attempt will be made to rob this house.
Oh, I say.
- Not really?
I take you to mean burglars?
A burglar.
A?
Meaning one?
Aye.
This is very disturbing.
My wife is nervous enough already.
We've been reading all about this chap in the papers.
Oh, what's his name?
The Amateur Cracksman.
Ha. Amateur Cracksman.
The names these journalists invent.
Besides, there doesn't seem to be much very amateur about him by all accounts.
What do you say, Inspector?
- I agree. He is misnamed.
I call him just a thief.
As I told you, Inspector.
Lady Melrose is a very nervous woman.
I don't want her to know anything about this. Not a thing.
Or any of my other guests.
- I understand.
I am afraid she may come in at any moment.
Raffles, would you mind going out to her?
Well, it's been very nice meeting you, Inspector.
Excuse me.
Now, Inspector.
What do you propose to do?
I wonder would it be inconveniencing you too much Lord Melrose ..
If I was to stay here for a while?
Stay here?
Bless my soul.
What am I going to say to people?
Well, if I might suggest.
An old friend.
- An old friend?
Well, you leave me no alternative.
By the way, Lord Melrose.
You have a new telephone exchange here?
Yes, it's been in for two days.
A beastly nuisance changing your number like that.
Now, since getting that new number have you given it to anyone?
Given it? Not that I remember.
Yes. I've given it to one person.
At that beastly nightclub last night. I gave it to Bunny.
Who did you give it to?
- Bunny Manders. A nice young lad.
I've known him all his life. He and his sister are spending the weekend here.
Look here, you don't think that one of my guests is the ..?
Oh no. No, no.
No. That's purely a routine question.
Please remember that.
- Alright.
Who is that strange man with George?
I don't know. I met him only minutes ago and I didn't quite catch his name.
My dear, a most extraordinary thing.
A very old friend of mine has just happened to turn up.
This is mister ..
Cameron.
Mister who?
- Cameron, my dear.
One of the Scottish Camerons, you know.
He and I used to go deer-stalking.
Deer-stalking?
How do you do, Mr Cameron?
It's a pity you didn't get here in time for the music.
And George's snoring.
My dear, you know I don't like music.
Well, I don't like cricket.
But I don't take a nap in the middle of the playing fields.
Look after Mr Cameron.
Yes, of course. Come along, Cameron.
I want you to meet some of the others.
If you don't mind at the moment I'd ..
Like to have a smoke outside.
Yes, of course.
Enjoying a bit of air, Mr Raffles?
Oh, it's you .. Cameron?
Aye.
It was good of you not to give me away just now before the others.
Oh, not at all.
No, I always believe in helping the police whenever I can.
You know, I have a theory about the Cracksman.
I believe he is a myth.
Invented by Scotland Yard to cover up a multitude of, shall we say, failures.
Ah, now you are being very hard on us, Mr Raffles.
No. The Cracksman exists alright.
I'm going to hook him one of these days.
Play him and land him like a fish.
Like a fish?
Aye.
I'm a fisherman, Mr Raffles.
- Oh, yes.
You still haven't told me why you're fishing in this quiet pool.
I prefer not to divulge that.
Well, in any event I doubt there is anything much for me to worry about.
No.
I think you can go about your business undisturbed.
Thank you, Inspector.
After those reassuring words ..
I will.
There you are, A.J.
Mr Manders - Mr Cameron.
How do you do.
- How are you, Mr Manders?
Fine, thank you.
A beautiful spot, I'd call this.
Yes it is.
It reminds me of Stratford on Avon.
Ever been down to any of the revivals?
Yes, several times.
I saw The Merchant Of Venice there a few seasons back.
A student of Shakespeare, Cameron?
As well as a ..
Deer-stalker.
Well, a lover of the theatre, Mr Raffles.
You know, the finest performance of the Merchant of Venice I ever saw ..
Was with Maud Holden as Portia.
I imagine she was a bit before your time, Mr Manders.
No, as a matter of fact
Raffles and I saw her together.
We went to her farewell performance when we were kids.
Yes, she was magnificent.
Whatever happened to her? Is she dead?
No.
No, I don't think so.
In fact I heard of her the other day.
Well if you see her, I wish you'd tell her she still has a faithful admirer.
Yes. Two of them.
Ah.
Have a cigarette?
No thanks. I don't smoke.
Perhaps it's just as well.
There doesn't seem to be any in it.
Oh, Hiltons?
Why, Raffles will have one of those.
That's his favourite brand.
Really?
Yes, of course.
There you are.
- Thanks.
Mr Raffles.
Cricket has conquered music.
They are all calling for you.
Won't you come in and play lion?
Excuse me.
I just wanted to save you from that awful ..
What does George call him, "deer-stalker"?
Who is he? What is he?
- Well ..
You know something.
Come on, tell me.
Lady Melrose, I think it is most unfair the way they keep you in the dark.
Yes. That man is a detective.
- A detective?
What on earth is a detective doing here?
Well, he probably suspects an attempt on something.
Your necklace, for instance.
- My necklace?
What nonsense.
The ideas people get.
Why it's just all those silly papers.
- I agree.
And I suppose you probably keep it in a safe?
No. We have a safe here but ..
That is the first place burglars look.
I always keep my necklace in my bedroom.
Oh.
You think I shouldn't?
Well I imagine if there is a detective in the house it's alright.
He'd likely sleep outside your door all night.
He will do no such thing.
I shouldn't sleep a wink.
- He has to be where the emeralds are.
I will send them down to the safe and he can sleep here.
Good .. and yet ..
What?
As you say, that's probably the first place a burglar would look.
Just what I've always said.
I shall keep them in my room.
You will have the detective lying like a spaniel on your mat.
Not on my mat.
Well, you can't have it both ways.
Or can you?
Yes.
I think I can.
I've got an idea.
Mr Raffles.
I'm a very wily old woman.
George.
Yes, my dear?
I'm going up to bed now.
I want you to come up and get my jewel case and put it in the safe for me.
What? Why, you've never done that before.
Well, after all I've been hearing on the wireless about that amateur cracksman ..
I thought perhaps I should.
I doubted you would be so sensible.
I'll be up in a minute.
- Goodnight, Gwen.
Goodnight, Lady Melrose.
Goodnight. Forgive my going up won't you.
George's cricket was so exhausting I am worn out.
Sleep well. We will.
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Deer-stalking indeed.
I'll deer-stalk him.
I beg your pardon, Milady?
- Nothing.
Put the milk down there.
I think I will take a sleeping powder tonight.
Do you think it wise, Milady?
Wise? Why not?
I don't know. I just thought ..
- Nonsense, go and fetch it.
What are you doing?
- Leave the milk there.
[ Door knocks ]
Is that you, George? Just a minute.
Come in.
Here you are.
You're a very sensible girl, my dear.
- Glad you think so.
So do I.
Goodnight, my dear.
- Goodnight.
Nothing to worry about.
- No.
Why are you standing there, grinning?
- Sorry, Milady.
Got my sleeping powder?
Yes, Milady.
- Well, put it in.
I hope I shall get off to sleep quickly tonight.
Yes.
I'm sure you will, Milady.
Never used this safe.
Except to keep the poker chips in.
And Kitty's birth certificate.
A lock of my hair as a baby.
Well, that's that.
When was this taken?
Oh, that was taken last night at The Ambassador.
Good one of my wife, isn't it.
Now sit down, Cameron.
How about a whiskey and soda?
So Mr Raffles was with you last night?
Yes, Gwen and Bunny brought him.
We've never met him before.
What a nice chap.
Aye.
I've no doubt he was the highlight of the occasion.
And to come early to meet the guests and all that.
Well no, as a matter of fact he was very late.
For a while we though he wasn't coming at all.
Is that so?
Remember me?
- Oh, Gwen.
Everybody has turned in.
We have the whole place to ourselves.
I've never seen a warmer, kindlier moon.
Does it meet with you approval?
Yes, it is nice.
Shall we walk to the brook?
Gwen .. I've got ..
What's the matter?
I wish I could explain.
There is so many things I want say and so many things I can't say.
It is so bewildering.
Have I done something?
No, you've never been anything but sweet and wonderful.
Even though there must be questions.
Tumbling over each other in your mind.
Questions that should be asked.
But can't be answered.
Very well then. I ..
I won't ask them.
Gwen, there is one thing you must know.
One thing you must believe.
Nothing matters to me except your happiness.
How very considerate.
Well.
I don't suppose there is anything more to be said.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Ah, Raffles.
Everyone gone to bed?
We've just been putting
Kitty's necklace away.
Now the only thing left to do is to put on the burglar alarm.
Oh, you have a burglar alarm?
Yes. One of these new electric-ray things.
There are six bells and they ring all over the house.
That must have quite a musical effect.
Yes. And once the thing is set.
If anyone tried putting as much as his toe through a window.
I think we've taken every precaution.
- It seems more than adequate to me.
I'm just going to trot off to bed. Goodnight, Raffles.
Goodnight, Cameron.
Well, I'll say goodnight too.
I'll come with you.
Splendid. Splendid.
Are you sleepy?
- Aye. A bit.
Are you?
Yes. I'll probably read for a while before I turn in.
I imagine your work leaves you pretty tired?
It does.
I can think of only one job as exciting as tracking down criminals as you do.
What's that?
Dodging you fellows.
Goodnight, Inspector.
Goodnight, Mr Raffles.
Dear Mr Raffles.
[ Burglar alarm bell ]
A.J.
A.J.
What are you doing? Who are you?
Look here.
You can't do this to me.
Help me! It's the burglar, I believe.
Bunny!
Crawshay, huh?
Out of your depth here, aren't you.
I ain't taken a thing, Guvnor.
True, I ain't.
Well, Inspector. You weren't far wrong. I congratulate you.
I think we are both to be congratulated.
He didn't get anything.
Is this the "Cracksman" fellow?
This?
No.
He looks a pretty slimy sort of an eel.
I say, what about Kitty?
I had quite forgotten all about her.
Cameron, I am a little disappointed in your cracksman.
This isn't the cracksman, Mr Raffles.
Crawshay and I are old acquaintances.
I've been responsible for several little holidays of his.
That's too bad. Rather like fishing for salmon and catching a minnow, isn't it.
The salmon is still in the stream, Mr Raffles.
And patience is a virtue, Cameron.
It's alright. Kitty is fast asleep.
I am so glad she didn't wake up.
Well come along. I think we'd all better toddle back to bed.
Goodnight, Cameron.
You are A.J. Raffles the cricketer, ain't you?
Yes.
A nice looking little ticker you got there.
Well thank you. I hope you weren't looking at it professionally.
Blokes like me, we have an eye for little things like that.
Come on, Crawshay.
How extraordinary.
A.J.
Come in.
Hello Bunny.
- You dressed early.
Got to go to town on that business of yours.
Now?
What earthly excuse are you going to give to old Melrose?
I'll take care of that at breakfast.
Can I come to town with you?
No.
- Why not?
I can't sit around here wondering all day.
There is nothing to wonder about.
It's all going to be alright.
I'll have that money for you by dinner time.
Are you sure?
Just As sure as if it were in my pocket.
What do you expect, sir?
Not another attempt?
I don't know. But something.
That's why I sent for you, Merton.
If Crawshay knows something
I want to know too.
But if the jewels are still in the safe?
I know.
It's a puzzle.
Wait.
Cameron. Are you still here?
I thought your work was done.
No, not yet, Mr Raffles. Not all of it.
What did you do with your minnow?
- Crawshay?
He is in the village jail.
- Oh.
You are up early, Mr Raffles.
- Yes. A lovely morning, isn't it.
Had your breakfast?
- No, I haven't.
Aha. Here comes the saviour of the Melrose jewels.
Three cheers for Scotland Yard.
Good morning, Raffles.
- Good morning, sir.
Oh, kidneys.
- I say, Raffles.
What have you done to your hand?
It's nothing. Just a little bruise I got yesterday.
My dear boy, I do hope it's not serious.
I don't think so. Can you give me some bacon, sir?
But you are bowling for
Middlesex tomorrow.
It will be alright by then.
Is that an egg in there?
Yes. Look here, you may have bruised the bone or something.
Why don't you run up to London and let old Spurgeon have a look at it?
It's really nothing.
It's a very important match, you know.
Maybe I should go up.
Dash up immediately after breakfast and get him to vet it for you.
Yes. I think I will.
Get my bags packed and send the car round to the front door.     - Yes, sir.
I hope you're not leaving me.
George! George!
That sounds like Kitty.
What is it, my dear? I'm coming.
I've been robbed. George, where are you?
I've been robbed.
My necklace, they've stolen it.
Nonsense, my dear. Go back to bed.
You're all undressed. Don't look at her.
Don't be so silly. What does it matter what I look like. Don't you understand?
My necklace has been stolen.
Your necklace is in the safe. Don't you remember? You gave it to me.
No, I did not.
Kitty, those sleeping tablets have been too much.
I'll go and get it and show you.
- I gave you the case.
The necklace is not there.
I kept it in my room.
What's that?
Oh, you're still here, are you?
A fine detective, you are.
Letting them steal my necklace.
A detective indeed.
I believe it was you who stole it.
Have him searched.
- Lady Melrose.
You mean that case you sent down to the safe last night was empty?
Oh, so it's penetrated, has it?
Who told you I was a detective?
Do you think I don't know detective's feet when I see them?
Oh, Mr Raffles.
How right you were in everything you said. But why didn't you protect me?
Where were you, Mr Raffles?
Oh, where were you?
Aye.
Where were you, Mr Raffles?
I, when?
When the alarm went off.
I was in my room, reading.
Of course.
Inspector.
Inspector, look.
The case is empty. The necklace was never in the safe at all.
Of course not. I don't see what you wanted to go and look for.
Well, I'll give a thousand pounds reward.
A thousand pounds to anyone who returns the necklace to me.
All your nonsense of safes and detectives and burglar alarms.
Yes, Kitty. Now go back to bed, my dear.
You are all upset.
Gwen, will you be so kind as to ..
Or kidnapped.
Come along.
See that nobody enters or leave the house.
What's that, Inspector?
I propose to examine everyone.
You can't do that. I won't have my guests treated like that.
I'd rather lose the necklace altogether.
I'm afraid the matter is in my hands now, Lord Melrose.
And you will not lose the necklace.
Well I hope there is no objection my having my guests in the house.
I don't think I'll be needing those now.
That's right, isn't it?
We're under arrest?
Ah, I don't know.
I think we might make an exception in your case.
Oh, thank you.
That's alright. You can put
Mr Raffles' things in the car.
Wait a minute. Are you sure you would not like to search them first or me?
I don't think that will be necessary.
- Alright.
I am extremely grateful to you, Inspector.
Tell Gwen I'll call her from London.
- Alright, A.J.
Good luck with the salmon fishing, Cameron.
Aye.
I'm thinking of trying new bait, Mr Raffles.
Oh, splendid.
But Lady Melrose whatever possessed you not to put the necklace in the safe?
It was the way dear Mr Raffles talked.
A.J.? When?
- Last night.
He agreed with me that the safe would be the first place a thief would go to.
You mean he told you to keep it up here?
- No.
I told him I always did.
Did he ask you?
- Yes.
He seemed quite concerned about it.
Excuse me, Lady Melrose.
I must speak to him.
It wasn't his fault.
It was all my fault I suppose.
[ Car engine noise ]
Are you letting him go?
Yes.
Get a fast car immediately.
And this is what you do.
Take that fellow Crawshay out of the village jail and get him to London.
And when you do get him there, let him escape and then follow him.
What?
- Go on, don't argue.
This isn't the first time I've set a thief to catch a thief.
Filthy weather, Mr Raffles.
Did you get my cricket bag and put the car away?
Yes, sir.
- Thanks.
Oh, you're back, sir.
A boring weekend, I take it.
Not exactly boring, Barraclough. No.
Any letters, any messages?
Bills. All bills by the look of them.
I'm afraid so, sir.
Leave that. I want you to go out for me.
I want you to go to the Airways
Office in The Haymarket.
And get me a seat on the evening plane for Amsterdam.
Here is a tenner. Sorry to send you out in the rain, but be as quick as you can.
[ Doorbell ]
Excuse me, sir.
Is Mr Raffles in?
- Oh, Miss Manders.
Gwen.
Crawshay has escaped.
Mackenzie let him escape.
What?
"Set a thief to catch a thief", he said.
I see.
Why did you do it? Whatever made you begin it all in the first place?
Too long a story to tell you, darling.
It's all so incredible, so fantastic.
Maybe that was the reason.
Well, thank you for coming to tell me about Crawshay.
I didn't come for that.
[ Doorbell ]
Don't let them in. Don't let them in.
Gwen, you shouldn't have come here.
- They couldn't keep me away.
It will be alright. It's alright.
Wait.
Come in here.
[ Doorbell ]
Ah, the fisherman.
- Aye.       - Come in.
You must have exceeded the speed limit.
I suppose police don't mind doing that.
Aye, I have a good car.
You have a good cloak too.
Yes.
It is useful cover in an emergency.
That's worth remembering.
What did the doctor say about your hand?
I haven't been down to see him yet. I'll go along later on.
Let me get you a drink.
- No thanks.
Do you mind if I help myself?
No. Go ahead.
Crawshay has escaped, Mr Raffles.
Has he now?
Well, that sounds rather careless of you, Inspector.
He is here, in The Albany.
Is he?
I must look out for him.
I am looking out for him.
I've got the place surrounded.
Then there is nothing to worry about. Except the necklace.
I'll get that as soon as I've got Crawshay.
Has he got it?
No. But he knows who has.
- Oh.
Do you mind if I look around the rooms?
For Crawshay? By all means.
Thank you.
- Do you mind if I read my letters?
By all means.
- Thank you.
A nice vase you've got here.
Yes.
Not big enough for Crawshay to hide in though.
Is this your bedroom?
- Yes, allow me.
After you.
Is this the bathroom?
Yes.
Go in. I'm not bathing at the moment.
And that other door?
That's the spare room.
May I see it?
At the moment, it is occupied.
Occupied? You don't say.
By a lady.
Her name is not Crawshay.
Hmm.
You can trust my discretion.
How do you do, Inspector?
Have glass of sherry, Gwen.
Yes, thank you.
That's a fine looking clock you have.
Are you interested in clocks?
Take a look at the works.
An interesting specimen.
I'll take your word for it.
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see it?
No thanks.
I've seen all I came to see.
And a bit more.
Maybe I will have a drink with you after all.
Splendid.
Have a seat.
Thank you.
Do you mind a pipe?
No, not at all.
What's the matter?
- I left my pouch.
Is this pipe tobacco?
- Yes.
I don't think you'd care for that.
Let me give you a cigar.
I have something rather special.
Thanks.
I'll smoke this after dinner.
Take another one for now.
No, I'd rather have my pipe.
Oh, my cigarette.
Oh, I am so sorry.
I hope you will find that alright.
[ Doorbell ]
Excuse me, I'm playing butler today.
Mr Mackenzie?
We've spotted Crawshay.
He's on the roof.
I'll come along.
You had better leave someone outside Mr Raffles' door in case ..
In case ..?
Well, in case Crawshay tries breaking in that way.
Oh.
I want to give you every protection, Mr Raffles.
Or in case Mr Raffles tries breaking out.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
- I do.
Put your hands up.
What do you want?
- I want the sparklers. So hand over.
Mr Crawshay, if I give you those jewels it won't do either of us any good.
The police want both of us.
They know you're here.
Yes, I don't think. You ain't going to get away with no story like that.
Either you hand over them sparklers or I blow the blooming daylights out of you.
Alright, then. Go ahead and shoot.
But do you know Crawshay what will happen to you?
Have you ever heard a man condemned to death?
I have.
The murderer I saw clung to the dock-rail like a wet towel ..
When the judge put on that black cap.
It's not a cap exactly.
It's a piece of silk or something.
Just telling you this so you'll know.
And while he does that there is a silence.
You can hear your heart going like a piston at the bottom of your throat.
You try to swallow.
But you can't.
That's when you feel the rope round your neck and the trap door under your feet.
And then from a long way away.
You will hear the judge's voice.
Telling you that you are to be hanged by the neck.
Until you are dead.
And may the Lord have mercy on your soul.
I'm sorry, Crawshay.
I admit that wasn't very fair.
Why, you ..
That's what comes of listening to a bloke like you.
I entirely agree with you. Now come on, we've got to get you out of here.
Here is the rope, Inspector.
That's how he went down.
Pull it up!
Got any money?
- Nothing.
Here's a fiver. It's my last but good luck.
Look.
Now go downstairs and get the pair of them.
They've got me, Guvnor. They've got me. What am I going to do?
That ledge. Down that pipe to the next ledge.
That window leads to a passage.
And then you're on your own.
Sorry for the bad evening.
You're a pal, Guvnor.
Before you go do a pal a good turn. Know what that is?
God love you, Guvnor. You're a pro.
A real pro.
Now for them.
[ Door knocks ]
Where is he?
Mr Raffles? He's in his room.
Of course I've got him.
He's been put out with something.
Where's Crawshay?
He got away through the bathroom window.
Mr Raffles.
Mr Raffles, what's happened, sir?
What is it?
- Mr Raffles.
Mr Raffles, sir.
What's happening?
Mr Raffles.
What is it?
Oh, Barraclough.
Well, Inspector. Crawshay came alright.
Aye, Mr Raffles. Crawshay came and went.
Inspector.
Inspector, we've got him.
- Anything on him?
Only a five-pound note.
A five-pound note?
Just a minute, sir.
Don't stop me. I've been sent for.
Gwen, my dear. What are you doing here?
What you must do too, Lord Melrose.
Trying to help Mr Raffles.
You are too late, all of you.
Confound it so.
Well, Inspector. You got your man.
Aye.
We got him alright, Mr Raffles.
Good. You can always depend on dear old Scotland Yard.
Yes.
Here is a warrant for your arrest.
No!
- What?
You will have to explain your business in Amsterdam, Mr Raffles.
My business in Amsterdam?
Amsterdam is the jewel market of Europe.
You are the Amateur Cracksman, aren't you Mr Raffles?
Yes.
Aye.
Raffles.
Well, there it is, Bunny.
I'm sorry, but there it is.
You still haven't got your necklace, Inspector.
Lord Melrose. Do you remember the reward you offered?
One thousand pounds to anybody that would return it.
I don't need to be reminded.
Bunny, could you use a thousand pounds?
I'm sure you could.
Now you just give the necklace back to Lord Melrose.
You will find it in my tobacco jar.
The tobacco jar?
Well, I'll be ..
Yes, I thought you would be.
A.J.
How could you have been such a fool?
Supposing I did need the money?
What is all this? I don't understand.
I think I do.
Now see here, Inspector.
We've got these back.
No need to go any further.
And I don't want any scandal.
Aye, you needn't worry.
Your name is not on the warrant.
Well Inspector, you got your necklace.
I have.
But you haven't got me.
Here!
Here, get after him!
Go and get something to break down that door.
[ Gunshot! ]
Good heavens, he's killed himself.
Gwen.
Go on.
Barraclough. The door.
I can't stop.
- No, hurry.
Goodbye, Barraclough.
Hurry Raffles.
Hurry, sir.
Good luck, darling.
They'll nab him downstairs.
I wonder.
You see him?
- No.    - He's got away.
You two men cover the side of the house.
- Very good, sir.
You get over there.
You two follow me.
We've the entire square surrounded, sir.
- Good, good.
Where did he go? Where did he go?
Don't stand staring like that.
But sir, but sir ..
- What's the matter?
You just went down that way, sir.
That was him you fool.
There he is.
Where?
"Meet me here at 7 o'clock."
"Positively my farewell performance."
Sir, it's a hoax to waste our time.
I'm not so sure.
You know, Merton.
There is not much fun in life if you never trust anybody.
And this Raffles fellow.
Well, I don't altogether dislike him.
I hope you're not making a mistake.
I'll chance it.
You may take your men away.
I think I'd rather wait for Mr Raffles alone.
Yes.
Darling, you shouldn't have come.
Suppose they're watching for you?
I had to see you once more.
Just for a moment.
Yes. But supposing they f頽d you here?
- Now don't you worry. I'm not worried.
I love you.
I know I said it before but I thought you may like to hear it again.
0h, darling.
No matter what happens, we'll be together. Promise?
I want you to stay, and yet.
I want you to go.
It so happens I've got to go.
Where?
Just round the corner. I have an appointment at 7 o'clock.
I hate to keep anybody waiting but sometimes you have to.
I understand.
